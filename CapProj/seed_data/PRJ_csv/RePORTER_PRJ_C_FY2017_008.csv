Chronic drug users account for approximately a third of all cases of AIDS in the USA and the progression to AIDS dementia is markedly accelerated in opiate drug abusers.

LPLA2 is closely related to lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), a plasma protein that plays a critical role in reverse cholesterol transport via HDLs to the liver. Mutations in LCAT are responsible for a devastating disease known as familial LCAT deficiency. Both enzymes are believed to be important for amelioration of atherosclerosis.

TGF-?1 is a potent cytokine (potent inducer of fibrosis) and we have shown that it can be released from platelets and subsequently becomes activated by shear stress in vitro via thiol- disulfide exchange mechanism and that mice deficient in platelet TGF-?1 are protected from developing fibrosis in the heart when they undergo surgery to induce high shear stress. We thus propose to test the hypothesis that shear-induced release and activation of platelet TGF-?1 contributes to the progression of AS and thrombohemorrhgic complications observed in HF patients after LVAD implantation and if our hypothesis is correct, it will point the way to novel experimental medical approaches to prevent AS progression and to detect early complications in HF patients-implanted with LVAD.","9425980; ","AHAMED, JASIMUDDIN ;","GAO, YUNLING ","11/07/2014","10/31/2018","Affect; Animal Model; aorta constriction; aortic valve; Aortic Valve Stenosis; ascending aorta; Biochemical; Biological Markers; Blood Circulation; Blood Platelets; Breeding; Cessation of life; Cholesterol; Clinical; Complex; constriction; coronary fibrosis; cytokine; Data; design; Development; Diagnostic; Disease model; disulfide bond; Disulfides; Elderly; Event; Fibrosis; Functional disorder; Genes; Goals; Heart; Heart failure; Heart Transplantation; Hemorrhage; Human; Hyperlipidemia; Implant; implantation; In Vitro; in vivo; Intervention; Isomerase; Label; latency-associated protein; Lead; left ventricular assist device; Mass Spectrum Analysis; Measures; Medical; Modeling; Molecular; Molecular Conformation; Molecular Weight; Monitor; mouse model; Mus; Mutagenesis; mutant; Mutation; neutralizing antibody; novel; novel diagnostics; Operative Surgical Procedures; Pathology; Patients; Phosphorylation; Plasma; Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1; Platelet Activation; pressure; prevent; Process; Proteins; Proteomics; Recombinant Proteins; Recombinant Transforming Growth Factor; Recombinants; response; Risk; Role; shear stress; Signal Transduction; Source; Sulfhydryl Compounds; Surrogate Markers; Testing; TGFB1 gene; Thrombosis; Thrombospondin 1; tool; Transforming Growth Factor beta; Transforming Growth Factors; valve replacement; von Willebrand Factor; western diet; ","The Mechanism of Shear-Induced Release and Activation of TGF-beta1","123605","HT","Hemostasis and Thrombosis Study Section ","","","04","250000","178750","428750",""

The mechanism of epigenetic regulation in response to arsenic exposure is not understood, thus uncovering the molecular components regulating the arsenic epigenetic response will provide novel targets for maximizing treatment.

Every year in the U.S. alone, more than 300,000 patients are diagnosed with pancreatitis and over two billion dollars are spent on their care. There is currently no specific therapy for these patients, a lamentable situation arising from our incomplete understanding of its pathophysiology. Due to the paucity of the availability of human pancreatic tissues for experimentation, most of our information about biology and pathobiology of the pancreatic acinar cells comes from studies in rodents. However, numerous studies have suggested that there are significant differences in the physiology of human and rodent acini. Studies pertaining to human pancreatic acinar cells have been hampered due to a lack of access to healthy human tissue. Recently, however, the advent of endocrine pancreas transplantation programs has made healthy human exocrine pancreatic tissue from donor organs available for in vitro experiments. There are only a handful of such transplantation centers in the US, and to successfully harvest and study human acini in vitro requires an experienced exocrine pancreas lab. At our center, we are uniquely poised to fulfill both pre-requisites. In the current proposal, we intend to utilize acinar cells harvested from pancreata of healthy donors to study and validate basic tenets in the physiology and pathophysiology of human exocrine pancreas. Once completed, the data generated from the proposed studies will lead to accelerated development of specific therapies against pancreatitis.","6485137; ","SALUJA, ASHOK K;","SERRANO, JOSE ","03/01/2011","02/28/2017","","Physiology and pathophysiology of human pancreatic acinar cells","092145","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","05","120060","64232","184292",""

The overall purpose of PRS is two-fold, 1) to provide productive interchange between scientists of different disciplines sharing a common research interest in perinatal biology, and 2) to encourage development and collaboration opportunities for Young Investigators (YI's) to build careers in perinatal research. The annual meeting of the Perinatal Research Society (PRS) establishes a forum in which research at the cutting edge of perinatal medicine and developmental biology can be shared by leading investigators in the three disciplines. Each year the PRS YI Program also invites YI's (those trainees who are transitioning to independent careers, such as Postdoctoral Fellows through Junior Faculty) to join these national leaders in the field. As they consciously learn of new developments they also are given the opportunity to formally and informally discuss their own ideas. These combined activities provide a unique learning experience that would likely not be found at any other scientific function. We seek funding to continue to support a lectureship as part of aim 1 but mostly to support YI attendance and participation in the annual meeting of the Perinatal Research Society (PRS). In this way we can create collaborations and mentoring relationships that can become ongoing and are critical to YI's future research career success.","1876068; ","BIRD, IAN M;","HIGGINS, ROSEMARY ","04/01/1998","10/31/2019","Award; Biology; career; Career Choice; career development; Collaborations; Critiques; design; Development; Developmental Biology; Discipline; Educational process of instructing; Educational workshop; Electronic Mail; experience; Faculty; falls; Fees; follow-up; Fostering; Foundations; Funding; Future; Goals; Grant; Health; Health Care Research; Hearing; Individual; interest; Learning; Life; meetings; member; Mentors; Mentorship; Monitor; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development; Oral; Outcome; pediatrician; Perception; Performance; Perinatal; perinatal medicine; Postdoctoral Fellow; Preparation; prevent; Process; programs; Progress Reports; Reporting; Research; Research Personnel; Research Project Grants; Scientist; Social Interaction; Societies; Specialist; success; teacher mentor; Time; United States National Institutes of Health; web site; Writing; ","Perinatal Research Society Annual Meeting","036244","CHHD","Biobehavioral and Behavioral Sciences Subcommittee ","","","19","6000","0","6000",""

Adult stem cells including autologous cardiac progenitor cells (CPC) are currently used in the clinical trials to enhance the repair and regeneration of the diseased heart and have shown significant improvement in patients with ischemic heart disease. The available results however show modest gain in improved heart functions in patients treated with stem cells. Part of the reasons that limit the full benefits of such therapies is poor survival of transplanted cells and inefficient activation of tissue residing stem cells. Studies proposed in ths application provide a novel approach to enhance the survival and function of CPC. Most importantly, our results may significantly improve the benefits of an existing cellular therapy and improve the lives of the over 16 million patients in the United States living with coronary heart disease.","7117773; ","KISHORE, RAJ ;","WONG, RENEE P.","11/11/2014","10/31/2018","Adoptive Cell Transfers; Adoptive Transfer; Adult; adult stem cell; Adverse effects; American; angiogenesis; Area; Autologous; base; Cardiac; Cardiac Myocytes; Cell Communication; Cell Count; Cell Cycle; Cell physiology; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Cell Therapy; Cell Transplants; Cell-Free System; Cells; Chronic; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials; Coronary heart disease; Data; Embryo; embryonic stem cell; Engraftment; Environment; exosome; Face; gain of function; Goals; Health; Heart; Heart Diseases; heart function; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; induced pluripotent stem cell; Infarction; Inflammation; Injection of therapeutic agent; injured; Injury; intercellular communication; Life; Link; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; Messenger RNA; MicroRNAs; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Mus; Muscle Cells; Myocardial; Myocardial Ischemia; Myocardium; Natural regeneration; novel; novel strategies; oxidative damage; Parents; Pathologic; Patients; Physiological; Play; Pluripotent Stem Cells; Population; pre-clinical; preclinical study; Process; Proto-Oncogene Protein c-kit; regenerative; Regimen; repaired; research study; response; restoration; Role; Source; stem; Stem cells; success; Teratoma; Testing; Therapeutic; Tissues; Transplantation; Treatment Efficacy; United States; ","Pluripotent cell-derived exosomes as mediators of myocardial regeneration","126186","MIM","Myocardial Ischemia and Metabolism Study Section ","","","03","250000","140000","390000",""
