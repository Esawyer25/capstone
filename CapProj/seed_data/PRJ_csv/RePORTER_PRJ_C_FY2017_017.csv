In individuals, chronic alcohol ingestion causes a myriad of defects in the lung, which renders them susceptible to lung infection and injury. The burden of alcohol abuse is even more prominent among the veteran population, especially among those previously engaged in combat. Studies have shown that veterans are much more likely to chronically use alcohol than the general population. In 2000, the number of veterans admitted to substance abuse treatment exceeded 55,000, and the most commonly abused substance was alcohol, comprising 68 percent of all admissions. Even more recently, operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have placed tremendous strain on military personnel resulting in a high prevalence of alcohol abuse.  Therefore, the veteran population stands to benefit even more than the general population from any interventions that may offset the detrimental effects from chronic alcohol ingestion.","9470006; ","MEHTA, ASHISH J;","","01/01/2013","12/31/2017","Acetaldehyde; Acute; Acute Lung Injury; addiction; Admission activity; Afghanistan; Aftercare; Alcohol abuse; alcohol abuse therapy; Alcohol consumption; Alcohol dependence; alcohol misuse; Alcohols; Alveolar Macrophages; Animal Model; Animals; Bacteria; beta-n-acetylhexosaminidase; Biological Markers; Blinded; Blood; Blood specimen; Bronchoscopy; carbohydrate-deficient transferrin; career development; Cells; chronic alcohol ingestion; Clinical; Clinical Data; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials; cohort; combat; Cysteine; Data; Defect; Development; Diet; Dietary Intervention; dietary supplements; Dietary Zinc; effective therapy; efficacy testing; Enrollment; Esters; Evaluation; Exhalation; Experimental Animal Model; Fatty Acids; Food; Functional disorder; Funding; General Population; Glucuronides; Glutathione; Goals; Health; High Prevalence; Human; Immune; immune function; Immune System Diseases; improved; improved outcome; In Vitro; Individual; Infection; Injury; Intervention; Intervention Trial; Iraq; Irrigation; Lead; Liquid substance; Lung; Lung diseases; lung injury; macrophage; Master of Science; Measurement; Measures; medical complication; Mentors; Mentorship; Military Personnel; Monitor; novel; operation; Oral; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidative Stress; Participant; Patients; Phagocytosis; Phenotype; Physicians; Placebos; Pneumonia; Population; pre-clinical; prevent; problem drinker; Procedures; programs; public education; Randomized; Recruitment Activity; Research; research clinical testing; Research Personnel; Research Project Grants; Risk; Role; S-Adenosylmethionine; Sampling; Scientist; skills; Societies; standard care; Stress; substance abuse treatment; Sulfhydryl Compounds; Supplementation; Training; Translating; Translational Research; translational study; treatment program; Veterans; Veterans Hospitals; volunteer; Vulnerable Populations; Whole Blood; Zinc; Zinc deficiency; Zinc supplementation; ","Alcohol abuse, oxidative stress, and zinc deficiency in lung disease","000643","PULM","Respiration ","","","05","","","",""

GERD and Barrett's esophagus are common disorders in our Veteran patients, for whom esophageal adenocarcinoma has become the most frequent type of esophageal cancer. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which block gastric acid production, are used to treat GERD and prevent cancer in Barrett's esophagus, but the frequency of esophageal adenocarcinoma continues to rise despite the widespread use of PPIs. This suggests that the reflux of noxious agents other than acid (e.g. bile salts) contributes to carcinogenesis, and this proposal explores how the esophagus can protect itself against those agents. The relevance of this proposal to Veteran's Health is that, by understanding the cellular and molecular events that can prevent Barrett's esophagus from progressing to cancer, we will be able to develop cancer-preventive treatments for our Veteran patients.","10081355 (contact); 1968094; ","DUNBAR, KERRY BRANDT (contact); SOUZA, RHONDA F;","","10/01/2014","09/30/2018","Acids; Address; ataxia telangiectasia mutated protein; Barrett Esophagus; Base Excision Repairs; Bile Acids; Bile Acids and Salts; Bile Reflux; bile salts; Biopsy; Biopsy Specimen; carcinogenesis; Cell Cycle; Cell Cycle Checkpoint; Cell Line; Cells; Chemoprevention; Chemopreventive Agent; Chronic; Complication; Data; Disease; Disease susceptibility; DNA; DNA Damage; DNA Repair; Epithelial Cells; Esophageal; Esophageal Adenocarcinoma; Esophagus; Event; Frequencies; Functional disorder; Funding; G1 Arrest; Gastric Acid; Gastroesophageal reflux disease; genome integrity; Genomic Instability; Genomics; Healed; healing; Health; In Vitro; Incidence; Inflammation; Injury; knock-down; Knowledge; Left; Maintenance; Malignant - descriptor; Malignant neoplasm of esophagus; Malignant Neoplasms; MAPK14 gene; Medical; Metaplasia; Metaplastic; Mitosis; Molecular; Noma; Oral; oxidative damage; oxidative DNA damage; Oxidative Stress; Pathway interactions; Patients; Peptic Esophagitis; Pharmaceutical Preparations; prevent; Preventive treatment; Process; Production; Proteins; Proton Pump Inhibitors; Reflux; repaired; response; Risk Factors; RNA Interference; Role; Signal Transduction; Stress; Telomerase; TP53 gene; tumor progression; United States; Ursodeoxycholic Acid; Veterans; XRCC1 gene; ","Mechanisms of Response to Reflux-Induced Oxidative Stress in Barrett's Esophagus","002666","ONCA","Oncology A ","","","03","","","",""

The number of heart and vascular procedures (balloon angioplasties and vascular grafts) that will be performed in 2030 is expected to be nearly twice the number per- formed in 2010. Similar increases will occur in the Veteran population. Regardless of whether the veterans undergo endovascular management or open surgical intervention, the long-term results are limited by throm- bosis or restenosis. If endothelial cells migrate across the injured area and create an intact endothelial surface that prevents clotting and scar formation inside the blood vessels, the outcome for veterans undergoing procedures to treat heart and vascular disease will improve significantly. Improving outcomes will decrease the need for reintervention and improve veterans' quality of life, leading to a very high reward for the project.","8834169; ","ROSENBAUM, MICHAEL AARIC;","","01/01/2017","12/31/2021","1-Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase; Adaptor Signaling Protein; Aging; American; Angioplasty; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Area; Arterial Injury; Arteries; atherogenesis; Award; Balloon Angioplasty; base; Binding; Biological Assay; Biology; Biometry; Blood Vessels; Calcium; Calcium ion; Calpain; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cardiovascular system; career; career development; Carotid Arteries; Catalytic Domain; Cell membrane; cell motility; Cell Proliferation; Cells; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.); Cholesterol; Cicatrix; clinical practice; Clinical Trials; Coagulation Process; Complement; Critical Thinking; Cytoskeletal Proteins; Diagnosis; Diet; Disease; Effectiveness; Elderly; Endothelial Cells; experience; feeding; Foundations; Functional disorder; Funding; Generations; Goals; Grant; Healed; healing; Heart Diseases; High Fat Diet; high reward; hypercholesterolemia; improved; improved outcome; In Vitro; in vivo; Inflammatory; inhibitor/antagonist; injured; Injury; Intervention; Ions; kinase inhibitor; Knowledge; Laboratories; Leadership; Lecithin; Length; Lipids; macrophage; Membrane; Mentors; Methods; Modeling; Molecular and Cellular Biology; Mus; novel; Operative Surgical Procedures; Outcome; overexpression; oxidation; oxidized lipid; oxidized low density lipoprotein; Patients; Phosphatidylinositols; Play; Population; prevent; Procedures; Protein Isoforms; Proteins; Pulmonary Hypertension; Quality of life; Reactive Oxygen Species; receptor; Research; Research Personnel; restenosis; RNA; Role; Site; Site-Directed Mutagenesis; skills; Small Interfering RNA; Smooth Muscle Myocytes; Stents; success; Surface; Systemic hypertension; Techniques; Testing; Therapeutic; Thrombosis; TNFRSF5 gene; Transfection; Treatment Protocols; United States; United States National Institutes of Health; Vascular Diseases; Vascular Graft; Veterans; voltage gated channel; Wild Type Mouse; Writing; ","Endothelial Healing is Inhibited by PI3 Kinase-Induced Activation of TRPC6","003628","CARB","Cardiovascular Studies B ","","","01","","","",""

Remarkably, some individuals suffer minimal or no adverse psychological sequelae despite prior trauma exposure, illustrating the concept of resilience. Resilience has a substantial genetic basis with heritability ranging from 38% to 71%, suggesting that genetic studies are likely to identify important causes of resilience. However, no gene for resilience has been confirmed thus far. Accordingly, the candidate proposes to perform the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of resilience. This well-powered study will provide insight into genetic factors that underlie resilience and hence protect against trauma-related psychopathology that are common in U.S. veterans. In turn, knowledge of these genes is likely to lead to more effective prevention and treatment for common psychiatric disorders in veterans exposed to combat trauma.","9229826; ","WINGO, ALIZA PHAM;","","01/01/2013","12/31/2017","African American; Applications Grants; base; case control; Child Abuse; Clinical Research; combat; common treatment; Comorbidity; Complex; Country; Data; Data Analyses; density; Disease; Doctor of Medicine; Doctor of Philosophy; Environment; Epidemiologic Studies; experience; Exposure to; Foundations; Funding; Future; Gene Expression; gene function; Genes; Genetic; genetic association; Genetic Markers; Genetic study; genetic variant; genome wide association study; genome-wide; Genotype; Goals; Grant; Haplotypes; Health; Heritability; Human Genetics; Human Subject Research; Individual; insight; Knowledge; Large-Scale Sequencing; Lead; Learning; Linkage Disequilibrium; Longitudinal Studies; Major Depressive Disorder; Maps; Master of Science; meetings; men; Mental Depression; Mental disorders; Mental Health; Mentors; Mentorship; Methods; Molecular Biology; Molecular Genetics; multidisciplinary; National Institute of Mental Health; Neurosciences; next generation sequencing; novel; Odds Ratio; Phenotype; Physicians; Population; Population Control; Population Genetics; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders; Prevention; Prevention strategy; Psychiatrist; Psychiatry; psychologic; Psychology; Psychopathology; Reading; Recording of previous events; Recruitment Activity; Research Design; Research Personnel; Research Project Grants; resilience; Resistance; Risk; Scientist; Sequence Analysis; sex; Signal Transduction; Single Nucleotide Polymorphism; statistics; Stratification; Structure; Substance Use Disorder; Techniques; Testing; Time; Training; trait; Trauma; Universities; Variant; Veterans; ","Genome-wide association study of resilience","000601","MHBA","Mental Health and Behavioral Science A ","","","05","","","",""

Women have up to twice the risk of PTSD as men (7). Compelling research on sleep and PTSD indicates that abnormal sleep plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of the disorder (8-10). Increasing evidence also indicates that sleep may impact memory for emotionally upsetting material (6, 11), and that women may have better memory for upsetting material than men (12-14), findings of major relevance to PTSD. Unfortunately, our understanding of the neurobiology of PTSD-related sleep disturbance is derived from studies of male, or predominantly male, samples (15). This creates profound barriers to understanding PTSD in women (12, 16-18). Increasing numbers of women are serving in the military, and are exposed to combat and potentially traumatic life events (19). Enhancing our understanding of sex differences in PTSD-related sleep disturbance is vital to developing treatments that adequately address the needs of both men and women veterans.","10440464; ","RICHARDS, ANNE ;","","01/01/2015","12/31/2019","Accounting; Address; Admission activity; Affective; Age; Area; Arousal; base; Behavior; Clinical; combat; Crossover Design; deprivation; Development; Disease; Distress; Emotional; emotional stimulus; Enrollment; Ensure; Equilibrium; Equipment; Event; Event-Related Potentials; experience; Female; Functional disorder; gender difference; Health; health care service utilization; high risk; Image; imaging system; Individual; insight; International; Laboratories; Life; Light; male; Measurement; Measures; Medical center; Memory; memory consolidation; memory process; men; Mentors; Mentorship; Military Personnel; Modeling; Neurobiology; neuromechanism; Nightmare; Participant; Physiology; Play; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders; programs; proliferative phase Menstrual cycle; Protocols documentation; Psychiatrist; Psychiatry; Public Health; public health relevance; Publishing; rapid eye movement; Reaction; REM Sleep; Reporting; Research; research study; Research Training; Residencies; Resources; response; Risk; Role; Sampling; San Francisco; sex; Sex Characteristics; sexual dimorphism; Sleep; Sleep Deprivation; Sleep disturbances; Solid; Stimulus; Stress; Symptoms; System; Testing; Training; Trauma; Universities; Veterans; Woman; ","A Study of Sexual Dimorphism in PTSD-Related Sleep Disturbance: A Focus on REM","000871","MHBA","Mental Health and Behavioral Science A ","","","03","","","",""

It affects hundreds of millions worldwide, yet there is only a single drug available for treatment and control. TRP channels are a class of ion channels that are critical for responding to sensory stimuli, as well as other key functions. We hypothesize that schistosome TRP channels play important roles in the parasite, including sensing the environment, acquiring nutrients, and responding to host signals. This project will test that hypothesis using a variety of molecular genetic, electrophysiological, and pharmacological approaches. This information may be useful in the future to exploit TRP channels as targets for new drugs.","1882204; ","GREENBERG, ROBERT M;","O'NEIL, MICHAEL T","01/17/2017","12/31/2020","Affect; Anthelmintics; Autophagocytosis; Behavior; biochemical tools; Biological; Biology; Bradykinin; Calcium; Capsaicin; Cations; Cessation of life; Childhood; Common Core; Development; egg; Electrophysiology (science); Employee Strikes; Environment; Family; Female; Future; Genome; Helminths; Homeostasis; Human; Hyperactive behavior; in vivo; Infection; Inflammatory; insight; Ion Channel; Ions; knock-down; Knock-out; Life Cycle Stages; male; Mammals; Mediating; member; Membrane Proteins; migration; Molecular; Molecular Genetics; Morbidity - disease rate; Morphology; Mus; neglected tropical diseases; neuromuscular; new therapeutic target; Nociception; novel; Nutrient; Organism; Parasites; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacology; Physiological; Physiology; Platyhelminths; Play; Praziquantel; Property; protein complex; Proteins; Publishing; receptor; Regulation; research study; response; RNA Interference; Role; Schistosoma; Schistosoma mansoni; Schistosomiasis; second messenger; Second Messenger Systems; Sensory; sensory stimulus; Signal Transduction; Site; Stimulus; Structure; System; Testing; Therapeutic; Tissues; trafficking; Tropical Disease; TRPA channel; TRPV channel; TRPV1 gene; Vaccines; Vacuole; Variant; ","Physiological roles of schistosome TRP ion channels with atypical pharmacology","123173","PTHE","Pathogenic Eukaryotes Study Section ","","A1","01","250000","152500","402500",""

My research program has used genomic profiling and complementary experimental modeling to define the inherited and somatic genomic landscape of ALL, and to use this information to develop faithful models of leukemia to inform new diagnostic and treatment approaches. My research program will use innovative genomic, epigenomic and experimental approaches to develop this research in the following areas: comprehensive identification of genomic and epigenomic alterations associated with treatment failure in children and adult in ALL, establishing polygenic models of ALL to functionally validate genes driving leukemogenesis; modeling the role of epigenomic alterations at relapse in ALL, and studying the role of leukemic cell interactions with the bone marrow microenvironment as a mechanism of resistance. Together these approaches will provide fundamental genomic and mechanistic insights into the biology of ALL and provide new avenues for therapeutic intervention in this disease.","9690171; ","MULLIGHAN, CHARLES G;","MUFSON, R.

The recent approvals of immune checkpoint inhibitors, nivolumab and pembrolizumab, for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer have represented a major step forward, however little is understood as to (1) how adaptive immune resistance occurs within the tumor, (2), why only a small subset of patients respond to anti-PD-1 and (3) what are the T cells targeting at a genetic level. The leading hypothesis is that the mutation landscape is important with data now emerging from our group and others, demonstrating the mutation load is important in immune checkpoint blockade response however this needs to be studied more exhaustively. This proposal will apply new technologies to the study of response and resistance to immunotherapies in the context of a multi-disciplinary team with expertise in patient-oriented research and immune monitoring, comprehensive genetics and informatics analysis of the tumor microenvironment with state of the art validation in vitro and mouse modeling.

We hypothesize that ALT-positive adenocarcinomas share molecular features with ALT-positive cancers of non-epithelial origin, and that these similarities will result in a comparable sensitivity to inhibition of DNA Damage Response proteins. Using CRISPR cas9 genome editing techniques, we will generate the first ALT-positive adenocarcinoma cell line from a panel of well-characterized prostate cancer cell lines, validate and molecularly characterize these ALT- positive prostate cancer cells, and investigate the potential therapeutic value of inhibiting DNA Damage Response proteins in these novel ALT-positive prostate cancer sublines.","10711037; ","GRAHAM, MINDY KIM;","MCGUIRL, MICHELE ","01/15/2017","01/14/2019","Address; Adenocarcinoma; Adenocarcinoma Cell; Apoptosis; Architecture; Area; ATR gene; Biological Models; Biological Response Modifier Therapy; Cancer Biology; cancer cell; Cancer Prognosis; carcinogenesis; Carcinoma; Cell Line; Cells; Cellular Stress; Characteristics; CHEK1 gene; CHEK2 gene; Chromatin Structure; Chromosomes; Clinical; Complex; CRISPR/Cas technology; DAXX gene; Defect; Deposition; DNA Damage; Elements; Endonuclease I; Enzymes; Exhibits; Genetic Recombination; genome editing; Genomic Instability; Glioblastoma; Glioma; Goals; Histones; improved; In Vitro; in vitro Model; inhibitor/antagonist; Islet Cell Tumor; Killings; Laboratories; Malignant neoplasm of prostate; Malignant Neoplasms; Modeling; Molecular; molecular subtypes; mutant; Mutation; Nature; novel; Nuclear; osteosarcoma; Pathway interactions; Patients; Phenotype; preclinical study; Process; programs; Prostate; prostate cancer cell; prostate cancer cell line; Proteins; repaired; Repetitive Sequence; Research; research study; response; RNA Interference; sarcoma; Series; System; Techniques; Technology; Telomerase; telomere; Telomere Maintenance; Telomere Pathway; Testing; Therapeutic; therapy outcome; Toxic effect; tumor; Variant; ","Establishing in vitro carcinoma models of the Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres pathway to elucidate molecular mechanisms and identify therapeutic vulnerabilities","213742","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","57066","","57066",""

Unusually poor smoking cessation rates amongst veterans with PTSD likely occur because standard smoking cessation treatment does not address symptoms of PTSD that motivate smoking and undermine quit attempts. We posit that behavioral activation therapy (BA), a brief and easily administered behavioral treatment, will overcome shortcomings of smoking cessation treatment by treating PTSD symptoms that interfere with smoking cessation.

Sexuality is central to intimate relationships, self-esteem, and quality of life, yet there are few studies o sexual dysfunction among veterans with PTSD, and none have been identified that take a biologically informed approach. However, neuroendocrine parallels between sexual behavior and PTSD may underpin problems with sexual intimacy and attachment. This study is designed to investigate the relationship of psychological and neuroendocrine factors with sexual dysfunction in OEF/OIF/OND veterans with PTSD. This investigation will advance understanding of how the psychobiology of PTSD affects sexual intimacy and relationships.

The annual cost of treating skin cancer in the US was estimated at $2.5 billion in 2010. The incidence of skin cancer is rising faster than any other cancer and affects 50% of those over 65 years of age. Early detection has significant impact on patient outcomes and health care costs, both direct and indirect. Skin cancers are mainly diagnosed by dermatologists using visual clinical evaluation. This assessment remains highly subjective and results in missed skin cancers as well as a highly variable ratio of benign lesions biopsied to malignancies detected; the biopsy ratio is as high as 50 to 1 for specialists. At an average cost of $200 per biopsy, an estimated $1.5 billion is spent on skin biopsies each year while the majority of these biopsies prove to be negative. Conversely, failure to spot cancer at an early, more treat-able stage may result in individual treatment costs of well over $159,000. VeriSkin will develop a low cost, non-invasive skin cancer diagnostic method and device that will (1) facilitate accurate, specific and non-subjective assessment of suspect skin regions by general practice clinicians and nurse practitioners, (2) enable precise targeting of patients for biopsies and/or escalation of care resulting in reduction in the number of unneeded referrals to dermatologists and unnecessary biopsies; and (3) provide overall reduction in skin cancer treatment costs.","8287625; ","CHACHISVILIS, MIRIANAS ;","EVANS, GREGORY ","05/01/2016","01/31/2018","","Hemodynamic Noninvasive Skin Cancer Diagnostics","203038","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","","","521409",""

We also discovered that neurons regulate protein homeostasis differently than non-neuronal cells in key ways that could be relevant to neurodegenerative disease. In this proposal, we will dig deeper to understand the homeostatic mechanisms neurons have for responding to protein misfolding and test two key ideas for how protein dyshomeostasis causes neurodegeneration. During the previous funding period, we discovered compounds that stimulate an important component of the protein homeostasis system, a clearance pathway called autophagy.

Mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure and myocardial infarction. These common heart diseases exhibit a mismatch between metabolic substrate availability and substrate preference: normal mitochondria prefer fats and proteins that most efficiently make ATP, whereas diseased mitochondria reserve fats and protein to repair heart damage and instead metabolize sugars. It was generally accepted that metabolic transitioning in hearts (from preferring fats to sugars or vice-versa) is simply a matter of genetic programming. However, we discovered that the heart must first rid itself of existing mitochondria before replacing them with those having a metabolic preference matching its condition. We identified the key factors responsible for removal, replacement and redistribution of mitochondria during metabolic transitions. Now, we are developing genetic and pharmacological means by which we can conditionally orchestrate and coordinate activities of these factors to match preferences of the heart's mitochondria to its available metabolic ?menu?.

We propose experiments to understand how the mutations cause disease by focusing on our unexpected discovery that TBK1 protein levels are decreased in UBQLN2 transgenic mice models of ALS-FTD that we recently generated. Understanding the connection between TBK1 and UBQLN2 could be important because loss of TBK1 expression is also linked to development of ALS-FTD. We also propose experiments to test whether genetic manipulation of TBK1, in an effort to restore its levels in our mutant UBQLN2 mouse lines will alleviate ALS- FTD. Additionally, we will test the exciting possibility, supported by our preliminary data, that UBQLN1 overexpression reduces ALS-FTD. The outcome of this work is likely to be impactful both in terms of our understanding of the mechanisms underlying ALS-FTD and because of its therapeutic implications for treatment of ALS-FTD.","1878029; ","MONTEIRO, MERVYN J;","GUBITZ, AMELIE ","01/15/2017","11/30/2021","Ablation; Affect; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Animal Disease Models; Animals; Autophagocytosis; Autophagosome; Behavioral; Binding; Binding Proteins; Biochemical; Biological Assay; Brain; Cell physiology; Cells; Cognitive deficits; Controlled Study; Data; Defect; Development; disease-causing mutation; end stage disease; Frontotemporal Dementia; Functional disorder; Genes; Genetic; genetic manipulation; Goals; Human; human disease; Immunoblotting; Immunofluorescence Immunologic; Immunoprecipitation; insight; Link; Lysosomes; Maps; Mediating; Memory impairment; Missense Mutation; Motor Neuron Disease; Motor Neurons; mouse model; multicatalytic endopeptidase complex; Mus; mutant; Mutation; Nerve Degeneration; Neurodegenerative Disorders; neuron loss; Neurons; Outcome; overexpression; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Patients; Play; promoter; protein degradation; protein function; protein misfolding; Proteins; receptor binding; Regulation; research study; Role; Site; Spinal Cord; Staining method; Stains; Symptoms; System; TBK1 gene; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Studies; Transgenic Mice; Transgenic Organisms; treatment strategy; ubiquilin; Ubiquitin; UBQLN1 gene; Wild Type Mouse; Work; ","Mechanistic studies and therapeutics for ALS-FTD linked to UBQLN2 mutations","098243","CDIN","Cell Death in Neurodegeneration Study Section ","","A1","01","269329","146111","415440",""

Currently, the treatment options are limited with low efficacy. The underlying cause of MDD is largely unknown, but epidemiology studies have pointed to the influence of adverse life events and stressful experiences. Therefore, we propose to address the molecular mechanisms by which stress experience induces long-lasting changes in the epigenome and causes alterations in gene expression that may contribute to the etiology of MDD.

Extracellular vesicles are tissue specific nanoparticles released by many tissue types into peripheral circulation; they represent stable protein and RNA cargoes that reflect and change based on the conditional stress on their tissue of origin, and therefore can serve as non-invasive biomarkers of transplant rejection. Our laboratory has found that transplanted tissues release donor specific extracellular vesicles into recipient circulation; therefore, we propose to study lung transplant specific extracellular vesicles from recipient plasma in murine and human models of lung transplantation to investigate the biomarker potential of this non-invasive platform.","11811818; ","VALLABHAJOSYULA, PRASHANTH ;","COLOMBINI-HATCH, SANDRA ","01/15/2017","12/31/2021","abstracting; Acute; Allografting; Animal Model; Animals; arm; base; Bilateral; Biological Assay; Biological Markers; Biopsy; Blood; Blood Circulation; Bronchoscopy; Cells; Clinical; Collection; curative treatments; Detection; Development; Diagnostic; Early Intervention; exosome; extracellular; extracellular vesicles; Feasibility Studies; follow-up; Foundations; Future; Graft Rejection; Health; Heart Transplantation; Histocompatibility Testing; Histology; Human; Immune; Immunocompetent; in vivo; Injury; Islets of Langerhans Transplantation; Kidney Transplantation; Laboratories; Left; Link; liquid biopsy; Liquid substance; Lung; Lung Transplantation; Major Histocompatibility Complex; Mentors; MicroRNAs; microvesicles; Modeling; Monitor; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; mouse model; Mouse Strains; Mus; nanoparticle; Natural immunosuppression; novel; novel marker; Organ; Organ Transplantation; Outcome; Pathology; Patients; Peripheral; peripheral blood; Plasma; potential biomarker; profiles in patients; Proteins; Proteomics; Quality of life; Research Project Grants; Respiratory Failure; RNA; Role; sample collection; Sampling; SCID Mice; screening; Signal Transduction; Small RNA; Solid; Staging; Stress; T-Lymphocyte; Techniques; Time; Tissue Donors; Tissues; Titrations; Transplant Recipients; Transplantation; Transplanted tissue; two-arm study; Urine; Work; ","Donor specific extracellular vesicle characterization for monitoring lung transplant rejection","132099","MCBS","NHLBI Mentored Clinical and Basic Science Review Committee ","","A1","01","157200","12576","169776",""

The experiments outlined in this proposal will help to define the mechanism by which NCAM and EphA3/ephrinA5 signal to promote elimination of excess synapses and define a pre- or postsynaptic requirement for NCAM in synapse remodeling, and I will also determine the role of perineuronal nets (PNNs) in termination of synaptic plasticity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC).","11203496; ","SULLIVAN, CHELSEA SUZANNE;","VAN'T VEER, ASHLEE V","12/01/2016","06/30/2017","abstracting; Acute; Address; Adhesions; Area; Autistic Disorder; Binding; Biological Assay; Bipolar Disorder; Brain; Cell Adhesion Molecules; Cell surface; Cognitive deficits; Complex; conditional mutant; CSPG3 gene; Data; Development; Disease; Equilibrium; Etiology; Event; Extracellular Domain; Goals; Growth Cones; hippocampal pyramidal neuron; Image; Immunoglobulins; in vivo; Inhibitory Synapse; insight; Interneurons; Knockout Mice; Life; Ligands; Link; LoxP-flanked allele; Medial; Mediating; Molecular; mouse development; mouse model; Mus; mutant; Myoepithelial cell; NCAM1 gene; nerve supply; nervous system disorder; Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules; Neurites; Neurodevelopmental Disorder; Neurons; neuropsychiatric disorder; novel; Output; Parvalbumins; Play; postnatal; postsynaptic; Prefrontal Cortex; premature; presynaptic; Presynaptic Receptors; prevent; Process; Property; Protein Tyrosine Kinase; Pyramidal Cells; receptor; Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases; Regulation; Reporter; Research; research study; Role; Schizophrenia; Short-Term Memory; Signal Transduction; Slice; Staging; Synapses; Synaptic plasticity; synaptogenesis; Testing; two-photon; Work; ","Mechanisms of Synapse Remodeling of Cortical GABAergic Interneurons","111189","","","","S1","01","1400","","1400",""
