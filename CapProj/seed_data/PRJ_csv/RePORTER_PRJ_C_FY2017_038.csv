An estimated 5.3 million Americans of all ages have Alzheimer's Disease (AD) in 2015. This includes an estimated 5 million people age 65 and older. Longer life spans and aging baby boomers will cause this number increase dramatically in the years ahead. People with memory loss face considerable challenges including a decrease in their ability to communicate along with increased emotional distress. Caregivers and family also experience the negative impact of the relative's inability to recollect and communicate and as a result also experience stress. The stress associated with care provision often negatively influences family members' ability to provide care and support. For people with AD and other dementias, aggregate payments for health care, long-term care and hospice are projected to increase from $183 billion in 2011 to $1.1 trillion in 2050 (in 2011 dollars).","1957415; ","KLASSEN, DANIEL L;","MCLINDEN, KRISTINA ","08/01/2014","04/30/2018","Adult; Adverse effects; Age; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease; American; Arts; Attention; Caregiver Burden; Caregivers; Caring; Clinical; Clip; Cognition; Cognitive; cohort; commercialization; Communication; Communities; cost; Creativeness; Data; Databases; Dementia; design; Development; digital; Disease; Elderly; Elements; emerging adult; emotional distress; Evaluation; Event; Exercise; experience; Face; Family Caregiver; family influence; Family member; Fostering; Healthcare; Hobbies; Hospice Care; Impaired cognition; improved; Individual; innovation; interest; Intervention; Interview; Knowledge; Life Experience; long term memory; Long-Term Care; Longevity; Mechanics; Memory; Memory Loss; Mental Health; Methods; mobile application; Modification; Moods; movie; Music; novel strategies; Participant; payment; Personal Satisfaction; Personality; Persons; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacology; Phase; phase I trial; Play; Population; pressure; Problem behavior; prototype; Provider; public health relevance; Quality of life; racial and ethnic; Randomized; Relaxation; Research; Small Business Innovation Research Grant; social group; Social Interaction; Stream; Stress; Structure; symptom management; Tablets; Technology; Testing; Text; Therapeutic Intervention; Time; Touch sensation; Toy; Training; Translating; United States National Institutes of Health; Youth; ","Memory Matters: A Mobile Aid to Stimulate Reminiscing in Persons with Memory Loss","053923","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","03","","","681115",""

Protease inhibitor booster antiretroviral therapy (PI-ART) which is used by ~50% of HIV infected people in the USA is an established risk factor for diabetes. Unlike HIV uninfected people, weight loss and anti-diabetic drug therapy are less effective to improve insulin resistance in people with treated HIV. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), a naturally occurring bile salt, improves insulin sensitivity in HIV uninfected subjects, although the mechanisms for these benefits are unclear. The goal of this project is to determine if TUDCA will improve insulin action in people with HIV who are receiving PI-ART. Further, this project will clarify the molecular mechanisms responsible for these improvements potentially benefitting society, irrespective of HIV status.","6710348; ","REEDS, DOMINIC N;","BREMER, ANDREW ","07/01/2013","05/31/2018","Adipocytes; Adipose tissue; Aftercare; Antidiabetic Drugs; antiretroviral therapy; Arts; ATF6 gene; Attenuated; bile salts; Biogenesis; Biopsy; Body Weight decreased; Cardiovascular Diseases; clinical care; Closure by clamp; Coronary heart disease; Data; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; diabetes risk; Disease; Double-Blind Method; double-blind placebo controlled trial; effective therapy; Endoplasmic Reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum stress; Euglycemic Clamping; fatty acid oxidation; General Population; Genes; glucose production; glucose uptake; Goals; GPBAR1 gene; GRP78 gene; high risk; HIV Infections; HIV resistance; HIV therapy; Human; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; Infection; Inflammation; Infusion procedures; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; insulin sensitivity; insulin sensitizing drugs; insulin signaling; Intervention; Iodide Peroxidase; IRS1 gene; knock-down; Lipolysis; Liver; MAPK8 gene; Measures; men; Metabolic; Mitochondria; Molecular; Molecular Chaperones; mortality; Mus; Muscle; Muscle Fibers; Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; novel; novel therapeutics; Obesity; Organ; Pathway interactions; Pharmacotherapy; Phosphorylation; Placebos; Play; Population; Procedures; Protease Inhibitor; protein folding; public health relevance; Randomized; Randomized Controlled Trials; Receptor Activation; Risk Factors; Ritonavir; RNA Splicing; Rodent Model; Role; Signal Transduction; Skeletal Muscle; Societies; stable isotope; Stable Isotope Labeling; Stress; tauroursodeoxycholic acid; Tissues; Tracer; treatment duration; treatment effect; type 2 deiodinase (D2); Woman; XBP1 gene; ","TAUROURSODEOXYCHOLIC ACID FOR PROTEASE-INHIBITOR ASSOCIATED INSULIN RESISTANCE","096982","ACE","AIDS Clinical Studies and Epidemiology Study Section ","","","05","217500","113100","330600",""

Hence, AD is also considered as a disease of synaptic dysfunction. Drugs for inhibiting BACE1, also known as Alzheimer's ?-secretase, are expected to reduce A? in AD patients. It is highly important to ensure that BACE1 drugs will achieve the best clinical endpoints by not only reducing amyloid plaques, but also by enhancing cognitive functions. This study is designed to achieve a molecular understanding of BACE1 in synaptic functions and to explore strategies for enhancing synaptic functions or neurogenesis.

Recently somatic mutations in the H3F3A gene have been detected in 75% of DIPG cases. The median survival for patients with DIPG is about one year from diagnosis and no cure is available. H3F3A encodes histone H3 variant H3.3 and the predominant mutation at H3F3A leads to amino acid change at lysine (K) 27 residue of H3.3 to methionine (M). In human cells, H3F3A is one of the two genes that encode H3.3. In addition, 13 other genes encode H3.1/H3.2. H3.1/H3.2 and H3.3 differ by four or five amino acids and K27 is conserved among all 16 histone H3 proteins. Therefore, it is unknown how H3.3 K27M mutation, which occurs at one allele of H3F3A gene, promotes tumorigenesis. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that H3.3K27M mutation dominantly reprograms epigenetic states and gene expression and thereby promotes tumorigenesis. The planned studies will not only make basic scientific discoveries aimed at understanding the molecular basis of tumorigenesis, but also lay the foundation for molecularly targeted therapies for this deadly disease.","7931342; ","ZHANG, ZHIGUO ;","MIETZ, JUDY ","06/15/2017","05/31/2022","Acetylation; actionable mutation; Affect; Alleles; Amino Acids; Ca(2+)-Calmodulin Dependent Protein Kinase; calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II; cell killing; Cell model; Cells; Child; Childhood Glioblastoma; Collaborations; Complex; Coupled; Development; Diagnosis; Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma; Disease; Drug Targeting; Epigenetic Process; Foundations; Future; Gene Activation; Gene Expression; Gene Silencing; Genes; genome-wide; Histone H3; Human; human embryonic stem cell; insight; Laboratories; Lysine; Maintenance; Malignant Neoplasms; Methionine; Methylation; Methyltransferase; Molecular; molecular targeted therapies; mutant; Mutation; novel; Nucleosomes; Pathway interactions; Patients; Play; Primary Brain Neoplasms; Process; promoter; protein H(3); Proteins; Role; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; small hairpin RNA; Somatic Mutation; Stat3 protein; stem cell differentiation; targeted treatment; Testing; therapeutic target; tumor; tumor growth; Tumor Suppressor Genes; tumorigenesis; Variant; Vision; Xenograft Model; ","The epigenetic mechanisms of high-grade pediatric glioblastoma","204297","CNBT","Clinical Neuroimmunology and Brain Tumors Study Section ","","A1","01","267135","113213","380348",""

Improvements in pathogen screening, storage solutions, and leukocyte reduction have continued to improve the clinical benefits of blood transfusion and reduce the risks. Nevertheless, the biochemical and biomechanical degradation that occurs over the course of six weeks of storage is well established. Though the direct link between the degrading red blood cell and transfusion side effects is not completely understood, a real risk remains that over the course of six weeks of storage a given unit of blood may present a significant risk to a vulnerable patient. By storing blood under oxygen- depleted conditions the Hemanext Storage System reduces this degradation by removing a major root cause: oxidative damage to hemoglobin. In this application, studies are proposed to elucidate and demonstrate the clinical benefits of the Hemanext Storage System in support of FDA market clearance.

However, those who disclose are more likely to use condoms with uninfected sex partners and mathematical modeling estimates that increased HIV status disclosure to sex partners may reduce transmissions by 40-60%. Further, disclosing of one?s HIV status is important for accessing support which can lead to improved retention in care, antiretroviral adherence and decreased viral load. During Phase I of this project we developed an iPad based virtual reality system that features three virtual characters, two virtual locations and three disclosure scenarios which represent a variety of common disclosure experiences and contexts experienced by YMSM.

Falls also are responsible for greater than 20 billion dollars a year in healthcare costs in the United States. While many fall prevention strategies targeted against clinical risk factors have been tested, their success in reducing falls has been modest. Current falls research is mostly focused on clinical predictors of falls and there is a knowledge gap regarding the underlying biological mechanisms of falls in older adults. Moreover, the biological and neural risk factors for falls are potentially modifiable, and the paucity of data is a critical barrier for translation to clinical interventions.

Nine million people in the U.S. suffer from diseases that cause degeneration of photoreceptors - the light-sensing cells in the eye. The hallmark of these blinding diseases is photoreceptor death. When first diagnosed, most of our patients have already lost the majority of photoreceptors that mediate nighttime vision (rods); this, in turn, endangers the photoreceptors that mediate daytime vision (cones). The goal of this gene therapy-oriented proposal is to determine whether therapy is achievable in photoreceptor degenerations by measuring the pattern of rod and cone damage over time in mice and humans.","1927415; ","TSANG, STEPHEN H;","SHEN, GRACE L","04/01/2007","04/30/2018","Address; Affect; Age related macular degeneration; Age-Years; American; Animal Model; Atrophic; Bilateral; Biological Preservation; Blindness; Cell Death; Cell Therapy; Cells; Cessation of life; Child; Clinical Trials; clinically relevant; cohort; combinatorial; Complement; complement C2a; Cone; cone-rod degeneration; Contralateral; Cyclic GMP; Data Set; Databases; Death Rate; Defect; Diagnosis; Diagnostic; Disease; Disease Progression; Dysmorphology; Electroretinography; end stage disease; Enrollment; European; exhibitions; Exhibits; Eye; Failure; Follow-Up Studies; Funding; Fundus; Future; gene therapy; Gene therapy trial; Gene Transfer; Genes; Genetic; Genotype; Goals; Human; Image; imaging biomarker; Imaging Techniques; improved; Inherited; internal control; Killings; Laboratories; LacZ Genes; Light; Measurement; Measures; Mediating; Methods; Monitor; mouse model; Mus; Mutagenesis; mutant; non-invasive imaging; novel; Onset of illness; Optical Coherence Tomography; Outcome; outcome forecast; Outcome Measure; Parents; Pathologic; Patients; Pattern; Peripheral; Pharmacology; Phase; Phenotype; phosphodiesterase 6; phosphoric diester hydrolase; photoreceptor degeneration; Photoreceptors; pre-clinical; Pre-Clinical Model; prevent; primary outcome; programs; public health relevance; Reporting; restoration; Retina; Retinal; Retinal Cone; Retinal Degeneration; Retinal Diseases; retinal rods; Retinitis Pigmentosa; S-Adenosylmethionine; Safety; Secondary to; Series; Study models; subretinal injection; System; Testing; Therapeutic; therapeutic gene; Therapeutic Intervention; Therapy trial; Time; tool; Toxic effect; Trauma; Treatment Efficacy; Treatment Failure; Universities; Validation; vector; Vertebrate Photoreceptors; Viral Genes; Vision; Visual Acuity; Visual Fields; Work; ","Defining Barriers to Gene Therapy","018213","TAG","Therapeutic Approaches to Genetic Diseases Study Section ","","","09","250000","150000","400000",""

We will test the provocative idea tha factors produced in exercised muscle are secreted into the circulation where they gain access to the brain and induce cognitive benefits. Our transformative studies will take advantage of innovative experimental models and use proteomic and epigenetic tools to identify biological mediators and pathways responsible for the beneficial and rejuvenating effects of exercise on the brain. We will explore the mechanisms by which the muscle secretome changes during exercise, by which neural cells are modified by those secreted factors, and that mediate the possible persistence of those effects after the cessation of exercise (i.e., the epigenetic memory). The results of these studies have the potential to drastically alter our current concepts of the benefit of exercise on cells in the brain, on neurogenesis, and on cognitive function itself","1878892; 2204829 (contact); ","RANDO, THOMAS A.; WYSS-CORAY, TONY  (contact);","WISE, BRADLEY C.","09/30/2013","05/31/2018","Address; Adult; Affect; Age; age effect; age related; Age-associated memory impairment; aged; Aging; aging brain; Alzheimer's Disease; angiogenesis; Animal Model; Animals; associated symptom; Biological; Biology; Blood Circulation; body system; Brain; Capital; Cells; Cognitive; cognitive enhancement; cognitive function; cognitive reappraisal; Collaborations; Developed Countries; efficacy testing; Elderly; Endocrine; Endocrine Glands; Energy Metabolism; epigenetic memory; Epigenetic Process; epigenome; epigenomics; Exercise; Exercise stress test; Experimental Models; experimental study; Gene Deletion; Genetic; Genetic Transcription; genome-wide; Hippocampus (Brain); Homeostasis; Human; Impaired cognition; In Situ; In Vitro; in vivo; Individual; Injection of therapeutic agent; innovation; Intercellular Fluid; Intervention; Lead; Link; Maintenance; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; Memory; Microdialysis; Microglia; middle age; Molecular; Molecular Profiling; mouse model; Mus; Muscle; Muscle Fibers; myogenesis; Nerve Degeneration; Neurodegenerative Disorders; neurogenesis; Neurons; Organ; Organism; Osteogenesis; Parabiosis; parallelization; Parkinson Disease; Pathway interactions; Physical activity; Physical Exercise; Physiological; Plant Roots; Plasma; Population; prevent; Proteome; Proteomics; public health relevance; Quality of life; Regulation; Research; Resolution; Rodent; Scientific Advances and Accomplishments; screening; Skeletal Muscle; Societies; Synaptic plasticity; Technical Expertise; Testing; Time; Tissues; tool; Transcript; transcriptomics; Validation; ","A New Muscle-Brain Axis Underlying the Cognitive Benefits of Physical Activity","047820","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","05","491995","201718","693713",""

Most of these deaths are due to coronary artery disease (CAD). The most common treatment for CAD is revascularization, an invasive procedure which usually involves placing a stent inside an artery that is diseased. However, exercise training is often overlooked because clinicians tend to focus on repairing the coronary circulation and the potential need for revascularization. Studies have shown that exercise training can be effective for patients with CAD and that it saves costs. In this study, invasive revascularization will be compared to a structured program of exercise training over one year.

DSA could be avoided in the large number of patients with a suspicious clinical presentation in whom the diagnosis can be confidently excluded. Patients with low-grade lesions can be worked up and monitored non-invasively, avoiding the risks and high costs of DSA altogether. Conversely, patients with high-grade lesions can be triaged to treatment faster (e.g., fluoroscopy-guided intravascular treatment, gammaknife, or conventional neurosurgery), and in cases where treatment is unavailable at the presenting hospital, transfer can be arranged emergently.","7620461; ","BAMMER, ROLAND ;","LIU, GUOYING ","12/01/2015","11/30/2017","Affect; Angiography; Arteries; Arteriovenous malformation; biomedical referral center; Blood; Blood flow; Blood Vessels; Bypass; capillary bed; Catheters; Cerebrovascular system; Cessation of life; Clinical; comparative; Complication; Cone; cost; Cost Savings; Counseling; Coupled; Detection; Diagnosis; Diagnostic; diagnostic accuracy; Diagnostic Procedure; Diagnostic Sensitivity; Digital Subtraction Angiography; disability; Dose; Drainage procedure; Dural Arteriovenous Fistulas; Early Diagnosis; Evaluation; experience; Fluoroscopy; Goals; Gold; high risk; Hospitals; Image; imaging modality; improved; indexing; Individual; innovation; Intervention; Intracranial Hemorrhages; Ionizing radiation; Label; Lesion; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; malformation; Measures; Methods; Neurologic; neurosurgery; neurovascular; Non-Invasive Cancer Detection; non-invasive imaging; non-invasive monitor; Operative Surgical Procedures; Patients; Pattern; Perfusion; perfusion imaging; Physicians; Physiologic arteriovenous anastomosis; Population; Procedures; prognostic; Protocols documentation; Public Health; public health relevance; Pulsatile Tinnitus; Randomized; Recommendation; Research; Research Infrastructure; Resolution; Risk; Risk stratification; Sampling; Scanning; Seizures; Sensitivity and Specificity; service intervention; Signal Transduction; socioeconomics; Spin Labels; Structure; Techniques; temporal measurement; Testing; Time; Tissues; Translating; treatment planning; Triage; Universities; Validation; Variant; Veins; Venous; venous sinus; volunteer; Work; ","pCASL Methods for Detection and Characterization of Intracranial High-Flow Vascular Malformations","021029","MEDI","Medical Imaging Study Section ","","","02","125000","10000","135000",""

Strikingly, the incidence of PE has increased by 40% over the last several decades as a result of a significant increase in risk factors such as obesity. Obesity is a major epidemic in developed countries and the percentage of women who are obese or overweight has increased almost 60% in the last 30 years. Despite the fact that obesity is the leading attributable risk for PE, the pathophysiological mechanisms whereby obesity and related metabolic factors increase the risk for developing PE are unclear. The full elucidation of these mechanisms will hopefully lead to a more complete understanding of the etiology of preeclampsia and successful therapeutic intervention through the targeted disruption of novel pathways.","1893591; ","GRANGER, JOEY P.;","OH, YOUNGSUK ","","","Adipose tissue; Adverse effects; Affect; Angiogenic Factor; Animal Model; Arteries; Attenuated; Autoantibodies; Biochemical; Biochemical Pharmacology; Blood Pressure; blood pressure regulation; Blood Vessels; Body Fluids; Brain Hypoxia-Ischemia; Cardiovascular system; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell model; Cessation of life; Chronic; Conscious; Critical Pathways; cytokine; cytotrophoblast; Data; Defect; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Doppler velocimetry; effective therapy; Endothelial Cells; endothelial dysfunction; Endothelin-1; Epidemic; Etiology; Event; Excision; experimental study; Feedback; Functional disorder; Functional Imaging; Genetic Models; High Fat Diet; Hypertension; Hypoxia; Imaging Techniques; In Vitro; in vitro Model; in vivo Model; Incidence; indexing; Inflammation; Inflammatory; instrument; Ischemia; Kidney; Knock-out; Laboratories; Lead; Leptin; Link; maternal morbidity; Metabolic; microCT; migration; Modeling; Molecular; Mutation; Natriuresis; Nitric Oxide; notch protein; novel; Obesity; Overweight; Pathway interactions; Perfusion; perinatal morbidity; PGF gene; Placenta; Placental Growth Factor; Play; Pre-Eclampsia; Pregnancy; pregnancy hypertension; pregnant; pressure; Production; programs; Rattus; Reactive Oxygen Species; Receptor, Angiotensin, Type 1; Regulation; Reporting; Resistance; response; Risk; Risk Factors; Role; Signal Pathway; Source; Spiral Artery of the Endometrium; System; Testing; Therapeutic Intervention; TNF gene; trophoblast; vascular abnormality; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors; Vascular remodeling; vasculogenesis; Woman; Work; ","Project II - Endothelial Factors, The Kidney and Hypertension","051971","HLBP","Heart, Lung, and Blood Initial Review Group ","5471","","24","280232","147122","","427354"

Fortunately, researchers have identified factors such as cardiovascular fitness, which appear to slow aging among the elderly and can be successful targeted for active interventions to preserve function. However, we know little about how cardiovascular fitness and other factors may help prevent the aging process earlier in middle life. We propose to generate a large set of brain imaging data from middle and older adults, in which we can map the trajectory of the aging brain from as early as 40 years old, and determine if factors such as cardiovascular fitness have a protective effect there as well. If so, the work generated by this proposal may serve as a basis for future early intervention efforts.

Such changes appear exacerbated in Alzheimer's disease, a late onset disease for which age itself is the major risk factor. Exactly how aging becomes permissive for neuronal deterioration and disease susceptibility remains a mystery. Recently, we discovered that some neurons in aging C. elegans exhibit aberrant branching and outgrowth, and we have documented a global decline of synaptic structures with age, suggesting that fundamental neuronal aging mechanisms may be conserved from simple animals to humans. We plan to identify genetic factors that influence the structural maintenance of the adult nervous system by exploiting the experimental advantages of a powerful genetic model. Our planned work will address gaps in our understanding that might ultimately suggest novel and efficacious therapies to combat human brain aging.","1882487; ","DRISCOLL, MONICA A.;","WISE, BRADLEY C.","08/15/2013","05/31/2018","Address; Adult; Age; age related; Aging; aging brain; Alzheimer's Disease; Animals; Appearance; axonal degeneration; Biological Preservation; Biology; Biology of Aging; Brain; Candidate Disease Gene; Cell Death; Cells; Cellular biology; combat; Data; design; Deterioration; Disease; Disease susceptibility; Environmental Risk Factor; exhibitions; Exhibits; Experimental Models; Frequencies; functional decline; Gene Targeting; Genes; Genetic; genetic approach; genetic manipulation; Genetic Models; Genetic Screening; Health; healthy aging; Human; Impaired cognition; in vivo; Individual; insulin signaling; interest; Intervention; Investigation; Knowledge; Label; Late-Onset Disorder; Life; Longevity; Maintenance; Mammals; Measures; Mediating; Microscope; Mitochondria; Modeling; Molecular; Monitor; Morphology; Mutation; Nematoda; Nervous system structure; Neurodegenerative Disorders; neuron loss; Neuronal Dysfunction; Neurons; normal aging; novel; permissiveness; Physiological; Population; prevent; Process; Progeria; Property; protein aggregate; protein aggregation; Proteins; proteostasis; public health relevance; Publishing; Regulation; Reporter; Risk Factors; RNA Interference; SET gene; Site; Stress; Structure; Synapses; therapeutic development; Therapeutic Intervention; Tissues; trafficking; Work; ","Mechanisms modulating the maintenance of structural integrity in individual aging","046358","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","05","200000","110000","310000",""

We propose to develop models that address gaps in the statistical literature exposed by data produced in experiments using kinematic data to assess motor control, skill, learning, and recovery following stroke. In such experiments, subjects make repeated motions which are recorded in their entirety, producing a rich dataset that allows unique insights into motor control. Analyses in the neuroscience literature has to date focused on simple summaries of this data, reducing hundreds of motions to single numbers. In place of this immense reduction we propose a collection of models using a functional data analytic perspective to provide a comprehensive framework for the analysis of such data.","10781196; ","GOLDSMITH, ARTHUR ;","CHEN, DAOFEN ","08/01/2016","05/31/2021","Address; Adoption; Adult; Anatomy; arm; Bayesian Method; burden of illness; Characteristics; Clinical; Collaborations; Collection; Complex; Computer software; Computing Methodologies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Data; Data Analyses; Data Analytics; Data Set; design; Development; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; disability; disability burden; Economic Burden; economic need; Event; experience; experimental study; Fingers; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Hand; imaging modality; Impairment; improved; Incidence; insight; Interdisciplinary Study; interest; Joints; kinematics; Learning; Learning Skill; Literature; Location; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Measures; method development; Methodology; Methods; Modeling; Monitor; Motion; Motor; motor control; motor impairment; Motor Skills; Movement; Nature; Neuroanatomy; neuroimaging; Neurologic Process; Neurosciences; novel; Outcome; Patient Care; Patients; Positioning Attribute; Process; Recovery; Recovery of Function; rehabilitation strategy; Rehabilitation therapy; Research; Research Methodology; response; Sampling; Severities; software development; Speed; Statistical Methods; stroke; Structure; success; Techniques; theories; Time; tool; Training; Translating; United States; user-friendly; Work; ","Functional data analytics for kinematic assessments of motor control","097423","BMRD","Biostatistical Methods and Research Design Study Section ","","","02","245875","105000","350875",""

We also propose to structurally identify underlying conformational events in prestin using cryo-electron microscopy.

We discovered a highly-selective fluorescent imaging agent, SBK2, based upon the recognition of an extracellular fragment of PTPµ that is cleaved in the tumor microenvironment. Through an Academic Industrial Partnership, we propose to translate this SBK2 agent for pre-surgical systemic delivery to GBM tissue and render it visible in real-time by current surgical microscopy adapted with standard fluorescent filters. We expect the fluorescent SBK2 molecular imaging agent will enhance the efficacy and efficiency of GBM surgery by allowing real-time decisions regarding tumor borders.","1939905 (contact); 14771447; 1906692; ","BRADY-KALNAY, SUSANN M (contact); GASTINEAU, EDWARD ; SLOAN, ANDREW E;","BAKER, HOUSTON ","06/15/2017","05/31/2022","3-Dimensional; Acids; Aminolevulinic Acid; Bidens; Binding; Biodistribution; Blood - brain barrier anatomy; Brain; Brain Neoplasms; cancer cell; Cancerous; Cell Adhesion Molecules; Cell surface; Chemicals; chemoradiation; Cleaved cell; Clinical; clinical imaging; Clinical Trials; Collaborations; commercialization; Conduct Clinical Trials; Cyclic GMP; Data; Development; Diffuse; Doctor of Medicine; Dose; Drug Kinetics; Effectiveness; Europe; European; Excision; experience; extracellular; FDA approved; Fluorescence; fluorescence imaging; Fluorescent Dyes; Glioblastoma; Goals; Government; Grant; Guidelines; Histopathology; Human; Image; imaging agent; imaging biomarker; imaging capabilities; imaging study; improved; in vivo; Individual; Industrialization; industry partner; Inflammatory; Intravenous; Investigation; Label; Malignant neoplasm of brain; Malignant Neoplasms; Maximum Tolerated Dose; meetings; Microglia; Microscope; Microscopy; millimeter; Molecular; Molecular Biology; molecular imaging; Mus; National Comprehensive Cancer Network; neoplastic cell; Neurosurgeon; neurosurgery; next generation; Normal tissue morphology; novel; Operative Surgical Procedures; Patients; Performance; Pharmacodynamics; Phase; pre-clinical; Primary Brain Neoplasms; Production; programs; Protein Fragment; Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase; Proteolysis; Quality Control; Rare Diseases; receptor; reconstruction; Recurrence; Rodent; Safety; safety testing; Sensitivity and Specificity; standard of care; Surgeon; survival outcome; Testing; Time; time use; Tissues; Toxic effect; Toxicology; Translating; Translations; tumor; Tumor Burden; tumor microenvironment; Tumor Tissue; uptake; virtual; Work; Xenograft Model; Xenograft procedure; ","A Novel Molecular Imaging Agent for Surgical Resection of Invasive Brain Tumors","217956","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","414642","248267","662909",""

Brachytherapy (implantation of radioactive seeds into the prostate) is widely used in the treatment of prostate cancer, and recent randomized evidence has shown it to be superior to dose-escalated beam radiation for patients with potentially lethal prostate cancer, but its use in this manner is tempered by concerns regarding toxicity from dose to nearby critical tissue structures, or insufficient dose to the cancerous regions. We plan to develop a system which allows physicians to use image-guided brachytherapy while also visualizing involved and uninvolved regions of prostate as identified on PET, thus allowing maximal sparing of normal tissues while maintaining or enhancing tumoricidal effect.","8495898; 9853557; 8605724 (contact); ","BURDETTE, EVERETTE C; LEE, JUNGHOON ; SONG, DANNY  (contact);","CAPALA, JACEK ","06/09/2010","05/31/2022","Algorithms; Anatomy; antigen binding; Assessment tool; Brachytherapy; Cancer Control; Cancer Etiology; cancer imaging; Cancer Survivor; Cancerous; Cessation of life; Clinical; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials; commercialization; Computing Methodologies; Data; Development; Diagnosis; disorder control; Dose; dosimetry; Edema; Extraprostatic; FDA approved; Feasibility Studies; Fluoroscopy; FOLH1 gene; Future; Generations; Gland; High-Risk Cancer; image guided; Imagery; Implant; improved; Individual; individual patient; Institutional Review Boards; intraoperative imaging; Lead; Malignant neoplasm of prostate; Malignant Neoplasms; men; mortality; Normal tissue morphology; Organ; Outcome; Patients; Performance; personalized medicine; PET/CT scan; Phase II Clinical Trials; phase II trial; Physicians; Positioning Attribute; Positron-Emission Tomography; Postoperative Period; pre-clinical; Procedures; Prostate; Prostate Cancer therapy; Prostatic; PSA screening; Public Health; Quality of life; Quantitative Evaluations; Radiation; Radiation exposure; Radioactive Seed Implantation; Randomized; randomized trial; reconstruction; Rectum; response; Screening for Prostate Cancer; Seeds; Software Tools; Source; standard of care; stem; Structure; System; targeted imaging; Techniques; Tissues; Toxic effect; treatment planning; tumor; Ultrasonography; Uncertainty; Update; Urethra; Validation; Work; X-Ray Computed Tomography; ","PET-determined prostate brachytherapy dosing using intraoperative image-guidance","151395","BMIT","Biomedical Imaging Technology Study Section ","","","05","399087","133226","532313",""

It is the leading genetic killer of children under two years of age. SMA is caused by mutations in the SMN1 gene, which is deleted in over 95% of patients. Currently there is no treatment for SMA, resulting in a large unmet medical need throughout the world. However, researchers have suggested that SMA is one of the neurological diseases closest to treatment. This is due both to the genetic homogeneity of the disease and the presence of a back-up gene called SMN2. This provides great therapeutic possibility for SMA, with few other diseases having such an obvious route for drug therapy. In fact, this past September Biogen submitted the first ever NDA for SMA to the FDA for a drug targeting the SMN2 back-up gene. Cure SMA has hosted the Annual SMA Researcher Meeting for 21 years, with the goal of accelerating research towards a treatment for SMA. The conference is now the largest SMA research conference in the world with more than 330 attendees in 2016. The overarching meeting goal is to provide a venue for SMA experts from around the world to share unpublished data and develop scientific collaborations to hasten the identification of a treatment for SMA. Conference presentations are organized into 3 major areas: clinical research, basic research, and translational research. Communication among researchers from these different scientific disciplines is critical to therapy development. A major focus of the 2017 meeting will be a special session on ?The Role of Fatigue and Muscle Weakness in SMA with Therapeutic Implications?. As mentioned above, the SMA field has made major therapeutic advances with SMN enhancing approaches. To achieve the greatest impact from this therapeutic approach, treatment early in disease course will likely be required. Therefore, the goal of this session is to discuss novel points of intervention that could result in greater motor and muscle function at more advanced stages of SMA. In fact, many older SMA patients cite fatigue and endurance as a significant concern, yet the biological origin, as well as the treatment options are poorly understood. The session will discuss fatigue and muscle weakness from a clinical and biological perspective, breaking down the potential role of the different components of the motor unit. Finally, eight additional conference sessions on the newest findings in the areas of SMA basic research, clinical research, and drug development will also be held.","11048732 (contact); 9714244; ","GLASCOCK, JACQUELINE J.

However, we found no association between use of the new supermarket and the dietary improvements. Our proposed study will continue to follow the randomly selected cohort to examine whether dietary changes are maintained, and to what degree a very large additional investment in the neighborhood results in dietary improvements. It is possible that the opening of the new supermarket created a neighborhood-level shift in socioeconomic conditions and, although much literature exists around neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) and its association with diet and weight status, we know of no studies that have linked shifts in SES to changes in diet or weight. Should neighborhood SES improvement underlie dietary improvements, neighborhood investments other than increased access to healthful food might serve the same function and should be considered.","8895079; ","DUBOWITZ, TAMARA ;","REEDY, JILL ","05/14/2010","05/31/2022","Address; African American; Alcohols; Area; Behavior; Calories; Capital; cohort; Crime; Cross-Sectional Studies; Data; Development; Diet; Dietary Fiber; Dietary intake; Disease; Economics; Energy Intake; Enrollment; Feeling hopeless; Food; Food Access; fruits and vegetables; Future; Geographic Locations; Grant; Health; health economics; Health Food; Household; Improve Access; improved; Incentives; Income; Individual; Intervention; Investments; Link; Literature; Long-Term Effects; Low income; Measures; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; Natural experiment; Neighborhoods; Obesity; Outcome; parent grant; Parents; Pathway interactions; Play; Policies; Positioning Attribute; Poverty; Process; prospective; racial and ethnic disparities; Randomized; Reducing diet; Research; Research Infrastructure; response; S-Adenosylmethionine; saturated fat; secondary analysis; Services; Socioeconomic Status; socioeconomics; Stress; Structural Models; sugar; Supermarket; Surveys; Testing; Urbanization; Vulnerable Populations; Weight; ","Urban Revitalization and Long-Term Effects on Diet, Economic, and Health Outcomes","149105","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","06","360274","295655","655929",""

Finally, we observe satellite cell specific forced expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) negative feedback regulator sprouty1 (Spry1) can attenuate the loss of satellite cells and myonuclei in the vicinity of aging NMJs. Our proposal will: 1) Identify whether loss of satellite cell derived post-synaptic myonuclei at NMJs are features of aging, 2) Define regulators of age-related myofiber transitions connected to NMJ disruption, 3) Examine the consequences of satellite cell depletion on the decline of NMJ and NMJ-regulated myofiber properties with age and 4) Assess the ability of satellite cell specific forced expression of Spry1 to attenuate age-related deficits in NMJ integrity and myofiber properties. Data generated by this proposal will likely implicate satellite cells and Spry1 signaling in the regulation of NMJ maintenance with age.

Our goal is to develop models of sufficient accuracy to be predictive for thermodynamic and kinetic properties, but also as important, to generate qualitative insights about the molecular mechanisms for binding and allosteric conformational transitions. The human kinome encodes about 518 kinases (PKs) which constitute one of the largest class of genes. Progress in kinase structural biology offers a conceptual framework for understanding many aspects of kinase biology and accelerating drug discovery programs targeting protein kinase. With our collaborators at the Fox Chase Cancer Center we are working on biophysical simulation and evolutionary sequence based approaches to rationalize biochemical profiling studies of kinases and to devise a framework for understanding the molecular mechanisms of selectivity of kinase inhibitors to their targets.

A common feature of ASD is over or under sensitivity to the environment and difficulty putting sensory information together in an orderly way, referred to here as sensory issues. Such sensory issues are now included in the diagnostic criteria in the DSM5 under the Restrictive and Repetitive Behaviors and Interests Criteria. These sensory issues have a deleterious effect on functional skills and limit participation in work, education, and social activities for individuals with ASD and their family. Building on previous work, this study seeks t extend understanding of Sensory Integration Therapy (SIT) as a non-invasive intervention to improve functional skills in children with ASD and sensory issues, and to test its efficacy in comparison to commonly used applied behavioral treatments. Further, we will explore the proposed neurobiological mechanisms by which this intervention may work, and phenotypic moderators of outcome. This study utilizes a randomized trial to compare SIT to a commonly used behavioral intervention to evaluate outcomes on functional skills as a basis for improved independence over the lifetime. A total of 180 children with ASD and sensory issues in the greater New York City Metropolitan area will complete this study.","7261351 (contact); 7349789; ","MOLHOLM, SOPHIE  (contact); SCHAAF, ROSEANN C;","KAU, ALICE S","09/15/2015","05/31/2020","5 year old; Academy; Address; Affect; Aftercare; Age; aged; American; Area; autism spectrum disorder; Autistic Disorder; Behavior; Behavior Therapy; Behavioral; Behavioral Model; behavioral outcome; Biological; Brain; Characteristics; Child; Cognitive; comparative effectiveness; compare effectiveness; Custom; daily functioning; Data; Development; developmental disease/disorder; Diagnostic; dosage; DSM-V; Education; effective therapy; Effectiveness; effectiveness research; Electrophysiology (science); eligible participant; Environment; Esthesia; Evidence based practice; Family; functional improvement; functional plasticity; healthcare community; Hour; Impairment; improved; Independent Living; Individual; innovation; interest; Intervention; life time cost; Longevity; Measurement; Measures; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; metropolitan; multisensory; Names; neurobiological mechanism; Neurodevelopmental Disorder; New York City; Noise; Outcome; Outcome Assessment; outcome prediction; Parents; Patients; Pediatrics; Performance; Persons; Phenotype; predicting response; Process; programs; Provider; public health relevance; Randomized; Randomized Controlled Trials; randomized trial; relating to nervous system; Research; Research Personnel; restrictive repetitive behavior; S-Adenosylmethionine; Sensory; Sensory Disorders; sensory integration; sensory mechanism; Sensory Process; Severities; Shapes; skills; social; Societies; Speech; Strategic Planning; Structure; Symptoms; Teaching Method; Testing; Therapeutic; Time; Treatment Cost; treatment group; treatment program; Treatment Protocols; trend; United States National Institutes of Health; Work; work-study; ","Sensory Integration Therapy in Autism: Mechanisms and Effectiveness","082814","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","03","415100","208700","623800",""

The only FDA-approved treatment is to provide chronic positive airway pressure, but this approach carries risks, including pneumonia. While airway stents have been developed for adults, they are too large and they have shortcomings, e.g, they impede mucus transport and can be difficult to remove.

The basis of essential hypertension is largely unknown, and current treatment strategies are suboptimal. This program of investigation will provide a new understanding of the adaptive kidney processes that limit the effectiveness of a widely used class of antihypertensive drugs, the thiazide diuretics, and translate this knowledge to drug discovery. Specifically, it examines how a salt gaining pathway is activated by the alpha-ketoglutarate receptor, OXGR1, in intercalated cells of the kidney when the thiazide- sensitive salt transport is inhibited, or when hypokalemic intravascular volume contraction occurs, as is commonly observed with vomiting or diarrhea. We expect these investigations will have a major impact on understanding how the kidney controls salt balance in health and disease, in ways that illuminate the central underpinnings of the variable diuretic response. Ultimately, these studies will provide new information and diagnostic tools that lead to the better treatment of hypertension.","1857949; 1898629; 1883547 (contact); ","DELPIRE, ERIC J; WALL, SUSAN MARIE; WELLING, PAUL A (contact);","KETCHUM, CHRISTIAN J.","06/15/2017","04/30/2022","Ablation; absorption; Affect; Alkalosis; alpha ketoglutarate; Angiotensin II; Animals; Antihypertensive Agents; Apical; apical membrane; Bicarbonates; Biochemical; Biological; Blood Pressure; blood pressure reduction; Calcineurin; Calcium; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cells; Chlorides; Chronic Kidney Failure; cost effective; Data; Diagnostic; Diarrhea; Disease; Diuretics; drug discovery; Duct (organ) structure; Effectiveness; Electrolyte Balance; Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay; Essential Hypertension; Failure; G Protein-Coupled Receptor Signaling; G-Protein-Coupled Receptors; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Transcription; Genomics; Health; Hypertension; hypertension treatment; Hypokalemia; In Vitro; Intercalated Cell; Investigation; Kidney; kidney cell; Knockout Mice; Knowledge; Lead; Light; Link; Liquid substance; Mediating; Medical; Metabolic; Molecular; Molecular Target; multidisciplinary; Mus; mutant; novel; paracrine; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phenotype; Phosphorylation; Physiological; Physiology; Planets; Pongidae; Potassium; Process; programs; promoter; Public Health; Publishing; receptor; Recombinants; Renal function; Resistance; response; Role; salt balance; salt sensitive; signal processing; Sodium Chloride; Stimulus; System; Systems Biology; Testing; Therapeutic Effect; thiazide; Thiazide Diuretics; tool; trafficking; Translating; Transport Process; treatment strategy; United States; urinary; Urine; Vomiting; wasting; Work; ","OXGR1 in Renal Intercalated Cells, Salt Transport and Diuretic Efficacy","110375","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","01","615970","111639","727609",""

This study expands a longstanding, bilateral, and inter-disciplinary collaboration between USA and Russia investigators to develop and test a novel intervention to reach social networks of out- of-care PLH in the community and then harness peer social support to improve network members' HIV care engagement and adherence. This research will employ a randomized trial design to rigorously evaluate a new strategy to reach and deliver intervention to improve HIV medical care engagement among out-of-care PLH in the community.

CD82 forms a protein complex of approximately 250Kd that includes ?7-ITG and other currently unknown protein members. Expression of CD82 is reduced in myoblasts from ?7-ITG knockout mice. Similarly, a reduction in expression of the CD82 protein complex is seen in mdx dystrophic and ?7-ITG knockout muscle tissues. CD82 knockout muscle satellite cells exhibit a defect in cell proliferation and show impaired reparative capacity in vivo. This application proposes to study the function of the CD82 protein complex in satellite cells. We will identify the additional members of this complex, study the post- translational modifications of CD82 in satellite cells and determine the stoichiometry of the complex in normal satellite cells. We will also identify the downstream signaling pathways of CD82 that lead to impaired cell proliferation of CD82 knockout satellite cells. We will investigate if these molecules are downstream signaling effectors of ?7-ITG, or are unrelated to ?7-ITG function. Finally, we will also study whether overexpression of CD82 in satellite cells can enhance their in vivo reparative capacity and improve the function of dystrophic muscle. These studies will greatly advance our understanding of the function of CD82 in skeletal muscle and they will provide the groundwork for future therapies aimed at stabilizing or boosting the expression of CD82 and its associated proteins in dystrophic muscle.","2093872; ","GUSSONI, EMANUELA ;","BOYCE, AMANDA T.","06/12/2017","05/31/2022","Abnormal Cell; Adhesions; Adult; Binding; Biological Assay; CD81 gene; Cell Adhesion Molecules; Cell Cycle; Cell division; Cell fusion; Cell membrane; Cell Proliferation; Cell surface; cell type; Cells; Complex; Data; Defect; Dystrophin; exhibitions; Exhibits; fetal; functional improvement; Future; Glycoproteins; Goals; Human; human fetus tissue; Impairment; improved; improved functioning; in vivo; Integrins; KAI1 gene; Knock-out; Knockout Mice; Lead; Ligation; Link; Mass Spectrum Analysis; member; migration; Mononuclear; Mus; Muscle; Muscle Cells; Muscle Fibers; Muscle function; Muscle satellite cell; Myoblasts; overexpression; Phenotype; Play; Population Heterogeneity; Post-Translational Protein Processing; premature; protein aggregation; protein complex; Protein Family; Proteins; Proteomics; Recruitment Activity; regenerative; Regulatory Pathway; Reporting; Resolution; Role; Sarcolemma; satellite cell; self-renewal; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Skeletal Muscle; SSPN gene; Stem cells; stoichiometry; Testing; Tissues; transcriptome sequencing; Transgenic Mice; ","Tetraspanin CD82 in muscle satellite cells quiescence and differentiation","069582","SMEP","Skeletal Muscle Biology and Exercise Physiology Study Section ","","A1","01","226890","157203","384093",""

AAT is a serine protease inhibitor (PI) that is mainly produced in the liver and to much lesser extent in alveolar macrophages (AM) and pulmonary epithelial cells. Neutrophil elastase (NE), the primary target of AAT, degrades elastin in the pulmonary alveoli leading to parenchymal destruction and subsequent emphysema. The genotype MM (PiMM) represents the normal allele that leads to normal protein levels and function. The Z allele, the most common genotype (PiZZ) associated with AATD, leads to protein misfolding and polymer formation, which impairs protein secretion from hepatocytes and can lead to liver cell toxicity and death. AATD is considered a rare condition but there are about 20 million individuals in the United States who carry at least one abnormal AAT gene. The prevalence of homozygous AATD (including complex heterozygotes like SZ) is at least 100,000 in the U.S with a similar number in Europe. Only a fraction of patients who have AATD have been diagnosed so far and up to 3% of patients diagnosed with COPD have AATD and most of these remain undiagnosed. Efforts to increase detection have met with some success, but over 90% of individuals with AATD remain undiagnosed. Other diseases that have been associated with AATD include bronchiectasis and necrotizing panniculitis. The natural course of disease is variable, poorly understood and patients do not present with similar manifestations or disease course suggesting the presence of other genetic and environmental modifiers that impact disease phenotype.

To increase power of association test and enable more precise phenotype and risk prediction, we will take advantage of the polygenic natural of most traits and diseases by accurately and flexibly modeling the underlying polygenic architecture. These new methods will facilitate integrative analysis with variant functional annotations, multiple phenotype association mapping, and phenotype and risk prediction in association studies.

Studies consistently find that early age of onset and, to a more variable extent, poor glycemic control over years are associated with reduced cognitive performance and altered brain structure in children with T1DM. As yet, our understanding of why early age of onset would pose more risks for the brain is limited, making interventions difficult to develop. Given that the initial clinical presentation of T1DM in childre is the earliest and often the most severe glycemic state they experience over their lifetime, it is possible that age of onset and severity of initial clinical presentation interact to modify risks fr brain health and development. This hypothesis has clear clinical implications and the potential to resolve conflicting literature, yet has not been explicitly tested. Thus, the goal of this studyis to determine how clinical features at the time of T1DM diagnosis, such as hyperglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and degree of beta cell failure, interact with age of onset to shape the development of the brain and its responses to subsequent glycemic control.","2098713; ","HERSHEY, TAMARA G;","STOECKEL, LUKE ","08/01/2003","04/30/2021","Address; Adult; Affect; Age; Age of Onset; Area; Beta Cell; Biological Preservation; Brain; brain health; Cell physiology; Cell Transplants; Child; Childhood; Clinical; Cognition; Cognitive; cognitive development; cognitive function; cognitive performance; cognitive rehabilitation; cognitive testing; Conflict (Psychology); Data; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetic Ketoacidosis; Diagnosis; Disease; disease diagnosis; Early Diagnosis; experience; Exposure to; Failure; follow-up; Future; Gender; glycemic control; Glycosylated hemoglobin A; Goals; gray matter; Heart; Hippocampus (Brain); Hyperglycemia; Hypoglycemia; illness length; Individual; Insulin; Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; Intelligence; Intervention; Kidney; Knowledge; Lead; Literature; Measures; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; Memory; Metabolic; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases; neuroimaging; Neurosciences; Newly Diagnosed; non-diabetic; Obesity; older patient; Outcome; Patients; Pattern; Performance; Peripheral Nerves; Physiological; Prevention; programs; Property; Prospective Studies; public health relevance; Residual state; response; Retina; Retinal Diseases; Retrospective Studies; Risk; Severities; Shapes; Socioeconomic Status; specific biomarkers; Structure; Suggestion; System; Testing; Time; treatment trial; white matter; Youth; ","EARLY PREDICTORS OF BRAIN HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT IN YOUTH WITH T1DM","064832","DBD","Developmental Brain Disorders Study Section ","","","12","367724","193055","560779",""

Life span is a complex trait with significant genetic variation in human populations. However, only a few loci affecting variation in lifespan have been identified, and the effects of variants associated with longevity and age-related diseases are typically small and account for little of the population variance. Human orthologues of genes identified in model organisms are excellent candidate genes affecting longevity because of the broad conservation of genes and genetic pathways across eukaryotic taxa. This study utilizes a new genetic resource, fully sequenced Drosophila lines, to map molecular variants affecting life span and derive gene expression networks causally associated with longevity. The novel genes and pathways we identify in Drosophila can be incorporated as candidate genes in human linkage and association studies.","1884457; 1887694 (contact); ","ANHOLT, ROBERT R.

Disease mechanisms involve cross-talk amongst pathogens and various host cell types (luminal epithelial cells, enteric nerve cells, resident immune cells, fibroblasts, microvascular endothelial cells and circulating leukocytes, inter alia). Amongst these, intestinal microvascular endothelial cells (IMEC) may play a central role in the progression of the disease by modulating infiltration of circulating immune cells and providing nutrients for inflammation resolution and tissue repair. Activated IMEC secrete various pro- inflammatory mediators and express cell-cell adhesion molecules that facilitate leukocyte infiltration. In addition, increased microvessel formation (angiogenesis) during colitis could promote inflammation and impact tissue regeneration/healing. Vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor (VEGF/VPF) has been shown to play important roles in experimental colitis. In our initial efforts to profile VEGF/VPF-induced genes in cultured human endothelial cells HUVEC, we found that the orphan nuclear receptor Nur77 was highly induced in these cells. Nur77 has been shown to play important roles in cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis. The goal of this application isto test the hypothesis that Nur77 modulates colitis by regulating the functions of intestinal microvascular endothelium: such as microvessel permeability, angiogenesis and leukocyte transendothelial migration. To this end, we have shown that Nur77 is highly induced in acute trisnitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) experimental colitis. Further, high levels of Nur77 are present in the colons of patients with IBD, when compared to non-inflamed colonic tissues. The present application will investigate how Nur77 specifically regulates endothelial functions and impacts progression of colitis. We propose that Nur77 expression in IMEC and infiltrating immune cells might play an important role in regulating acute intestinal inflammation. Aim 1 will examine several models of colitis in mice express Nur77 exclusively in endothelial cells. Aim 2 will determine the role of VE-cadherin-based adherens junction in colitis. Aim 3 will dissect out regulatory mechanisms of VE-cadherin expression by Nur77. Several genetic approaches include generation of inducible endothelial specific transgenic mice to express wild-type Nur77 and dominant negative Nur77 on both wild-type and Nur77-null backgrounds. Our studies have high impact by linking Nur77 to IBD pathogenesis and indicate vascular components of inflammation that could serve as therapeutic targets.","2050237; ","ZHAO, DEZHENG ;","HAMILTON, FRANK A","07/01/2013","05/31/2018","Acute; Adherens Junction; adherent junction; Adhesions; angiogenesis; Angiogenesis Inhibition; Apoptosis; Attenuated; Biological Process; Biopsy; Blocking Antibodies; Blood Vessels; Body Weight Changes; cadherin 5; Cell Adhesion Molecules; cell growth; cell type; Cell-Cell Adhesion; Cells; Chronic; Clinical; Colitis; colon carcinogenesis; Crohn's disease; Cyclization; cytokine; Development; Dextran Sulfate; Differentiation and Growth; Disease; Disease Progression; DNA Binding Domain; Dominant-Negative Mutation; Down-Regulation; Endothelial Cells; Endothelium; Enteral; Epithelial Cells; feeding; Fibroblasts; Functional disorder; Generations; Generic Drugs; Genes; genetic approach; Goals; healing; Histologic; Human; Immune; indexing; Infiltration; Inflammation; Inflammation Mediators; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Inflammatory disease of the intestine; Integrins; Interleukin-10; Intestines; Lead; Leukocytes; Link; Luciferases; Measures; Mediating; Messenger RNA; MicroRNAs; Microvascular Permeability; migration; Modeling; Molecular; mouse model; Mucous Membrane; Mus; mutant; Mutant Strains Mice; Neurons; novel; Nuclear Orphan Receptor; Nutrient; pathogen; Pathogenesis; Patients; Permeability; Phenotype; Play; public health relevance; Publishing; Regulation; Reporter; Resolution; Role; Sampling; Signal Transduction; Sodium Dextran Sulfate; Structure; Sulfonic Acids; System; T-Lymphocyte; targeted treatment; Testing; Tetanus Helper Peptide; Therapeutic; therapeutic target; tissue regeneration; tissue repair; Tissues; transgene expression; Transgenes; Transgenic Mice; Ulcerative Colitis; Untranslated Regions; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors; Vascular Permeabilities; ","Regulation of colitis by orphan nuclear receptor Nur77","095873","GMPB","Gastrointestinal Mucosal Pathobiology Study Section ","","","05","217500","160950","378450",""

All of this work during the initial funding cycle for this grant yielded multiple provocative insights into autophagy regulation, including the discovery of let-7 induction as sufficient to promote autophagy activation by repressing the newly defined amino acid sensing pathway (which activates mTORC1), identification of MAP4K3 as the kinase that may be principally responsible for TFEB localization to the lysosome and its inactivation, and delineation of how TFEB transcription regulation is controlled and how TFEB dysregulation occurs in neurodegenerative disease. In this renewal project, we wish to continue these studies and define the transcriptional basis for let-7 induction in response to nutrient stress, determine f and how MAP4K3 phosphorylation of TFEB is a crucial step in autophagy regulation, and examine let-7 and MAP4K3 expression modulation as potential approaches for beneficial manipulation of autophagy in neurons, especially in the context of neurodegenerative disease.","1926731; ","LA SPADA, ALBERT R;","WISE, BRADLEY C.","12/01/2008","05/31/2020","Amino Acids; Antibodies; Autophagocytosis; Binding Sites; Biological Assay; Cells; Cellular Stress; Central Nervous System Diseases; Complex; Corpus striatum structure; Cyclization; Data; Development; Disease; DNA-Binding Proteins; exhibitions; Exhibits; experimental analysis; Family; Funding; Gene Expression; Genes; Genetic Transcription; Grant; Growth Factor; Health; Heat shock proteins; Homeostasis; Huntington Disease; in vivo; inhibitor/antagonist; Injection of therapeutic agent; insight; integration site; knock-down; Lead; Light; Luciferases; Lysosomes; Mediating; member; Metabolic; MicroRNAs; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; MJD1 protein; Molecular Genetics; mouse model; mTOR Signaling Pathway; Mus; Nature; Nerve Degeneration; nervous system disorder; Neurodegenerative Disorders; Neurons; neuroprotection; neurotoxicity; novel; Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences; Nutrient; nutrient deprivation; Organelles; overexpression; Pathway interactions; Phosphorylation; Phosphorylation Site; Phosphotransferases; Physiological; polyglutamine; Production; Protein Isoforms; Proteins; proteostasis; Protocols documentation; public health relevance; Publishing; ras-Related G-Proteins; Regulation; Reporter; response; Role; Serine; Signal Transduction; Small Interfering RNA; Starvation; Stress; stress protein; Subfamily lentivirinae; Testing; tool; Transactivation; transcription factor; transcription factor USF; Transcriptional Regulation; transcriptome; Transgenic Organisms; Up-Regulation; Work; ","Molecular genetic regulation of autophagy in health and neurodegenerative disease","033082","CMND","Cellular and Molecular Biology of Neurodegeneration Study Section ","","","08","266272","146450","412722",""

Low dementia risk among Mexican Americans considering their education may occur because people who migrate from Mexico are healthier than people who do not migrate, and older Mexican Americans leave the US and return to Mexico if they become sick. To understand what causes dementia in Mexican Americans, we must account for these migration patterns and their correlation with dementia risk. Studying this requires data from both the US and Mexico. In this project, we will create a binational study of two nationally representative cohorts from the US and Mexico to study how migration influences dementia risk of Mexican Americans and factors that increase or reduce dementia risk in Mexican Americans.","8667368; 11055051 (contact); ","GLYMOUR, MEDELLENA MARIA; ZEKI AL HAZZOURI, ADINA  (contact);","PATMIOS, GEORGEANNE E.","06/15/2017","05/31/2021","Accounting; Acculturation; Acute; Adopted; Adult; aged; Aging; Alzheimer's disease risk; Automobile Driving; Back; Characteristics; Childhood; Chronic; Cognitive; Cognitive aging; cohort; Data; Data Set; Dementia; Disadvantaged; Discrimination; Education; Elderly; Environment; Epidemiology; ethnic minority population; Evaluation of Risk Factors; exhibitions; Exhibits; experience; Geographic state; Goals; Health; Health and Retirement Study; health disparity; higher education; Household; Immigrant; Impaired cognition; improved; In-Migration; Incidence; Individual; Infant Mortality; insight; International Migrations; Latino; Link; low socioeconomic status; Masks; Measures; Mexican; Mexican Americans; Mexico; migration; mortality; neighborhood disadvantage; Neighborhoods; Nomads; novel; novel strategies; Older Population; Outcome; Participant; Pattern; Population; Poverty; Predictive Factor; Prevalence; racial and ethnic; racial and ethnic disparities; Recording of previous events; residence; Resources; Return Migrations; Risk; Risk Factors; Role; S-Adenosylmethionine; Sampling; Selection Bias; social; Social status; socioeconomic disadvantage; Socioeconomic Factors; Socioeconomic Status; socioeconomics; Source; stressor; Testing; United States; Work; ","A Binational Study to Understand Dementia Risk and Disparities of Mexican Americans: The Role of Migration and Social Determinants","055486","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","1385798","328697","1714495",""

This proposal seeks to explore the essential eukaryotic processes of Ub/Ubl-protein modification and RNA processing and decay through structural, biochemical and genetic studies that will illuminate molecular mechanisms that underlie defects associated with human diseases including cancer, inflammation, and neurodegenerative disorders.","1922866; ","LIMA, CHRISTOPHER D.;","FLICKER, PAULA F.","06/10/2016","05/31/2021","Address; Biochemical Genetics; Biology; Cell Cycle Progression; Cell Cycle Proteins; Cell Cycle Regulation; Cell physiology; Cells; Cellular Metabolic Process; Chemicals; Chromosome Segregation; Complex; Coupled; Cytokinesis; Defect; Disease; Enzyme Activators; enzyme mechanism; Enzymes; Equilibrium; Eukaryota; Exoribonucleases; exosome; Genes; Genetic study; Genetic Transcription; Health; Homeostasis; Human; human disease; In Vitro; in vivo; Individual; Inflammation; Life; M cell; Malignant Neoplasms; Mission; Modification; Molecular; Monitor; Nerve Degeneration; Neurodegenerative Disorders; Nuclear; nucleic acid metabolism; nucleocytoplasmic transport; Pathway interactions; Peptide Hydrolases; Play; Post-Translational Protein Processing; Process; Protein Complex Subunit; protein degradation; Proteins; public health relevance; receptor; reconstitution; Recruitment Activity; RNA; RNA Decay; RNA Processing; Role; Saccharomycetales; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Signal Transduction Pathway; Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins; Structure; Transcriptional Regulation; Ubiquitin; Ubiquitin Like Proteins; ubiquitin-protein ligase; United States National Institutes of Health; Yeasts; ","Structural studies of RNA processing and ubiquitin-like protein modification","118080","ZGM1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","250000","189750","439750",""

Investigators at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) and The University of Minnesota (UMN) will join forces to accomplish the goals outlined by this RFA. The team at UNC has over 10 years of experience in recruiting and imaging typically developing and at-risk children, scanning over 1000 children from birth to five years. Well established infrastructure at the Biomedical Research Imaging Center (BRIC) at UNC and Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR) at UMN are in place to recruit and retain pediatric subjects and facilitate the coordination of pediatric imaging studies. A total of 500 typically developing children between birth and five years of age will be recruited across two data collection sites in a sequential cohort, accelerated longitudinal study design. The participants are divided into two main groups, longitudinal (n=285) and cross-sectional (n=215) groups, respectively. This hybrid longitudinal and cross-sectional design enables detailed characterization of early brain development from both brain structural/functional and behavioral aspects, balances between advantages offered by a longitudinal design and attribution rate, and accommodates the relatively short funding duration. Enrollment will include an equal proportion of males and females. The racial/ethnic diversity of the sample will reflect US Census data.

The proposed study will elucidate a novel mechanism by which extracellular acid causes neuronal cell death through ASIC1a-mediated activation of RIP1 kinase and in turn the necroptotic death pathway.

Patients often suffer from many disease symptoms including tissue damage (ulceration), painful inflammation around ulcers and in the case of the cornea, new vessel formation that can scar the tissue for life. We have recently shown for the first time that amount of an enzyme, called Heparanse (HPSE), increases with HSV-1 infection, which helps the newly formed virus particles to secure release from the parent cell to infect nearby cells. Based on some new evidence from other laboratories this proposal will explore the possibility that it is the higher amount of HPSE that leads to tissue damage and other symptomatic issues associated with HSV infection.

No where is this need clearer than for the brain systems controlling social behavior and emotion, where dysregulation of circuitry has been implicated in the most devastating mental illnesses. Animal models have been important in beginning to understand these diseases but it is now clear that the field must pay serious attention to Humans-First. Using an entirely new approach, highly multidisciplinary partnerships between neuroscientists and engineers and information theorists, we have found a powerful way to provide these. This dream is the vision and reality of this proposal. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), anxiety, depression, addiction and schizophrenia alone affect the lives of more than 70 million children and adults in the USA at a cost of more than $300 billion per year and incalculable human suffering. State-of-the-art superb NIH and foundation consortia have expressed dire need for biomarkers for ASD and the crushing effects of anxiety, depression. There is no time to be wasted and no way to replace the years lost for our nation's families. It is the goal of this proposal to accelerate greatly the pace of developing novel therapeutics and deep understanding of these mental illnesses through bridging the current chasm between finding a gene and understanding its role in determining human social behavior, and to speed the transformation of these insights to understand the causes and best treatments for mental illnesses that all take their toll on the sensitive balance of brain circuitry essential for a productive life. This knowledge of brain and behaviors that are very close to humans will provide insights into new drug targets to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure mental illness.","6849959; 1932311 (contact); ","JOSHI, SARANG ; KORENBERG, JULIE RUTH (contact);","SIMMONS, JANINE M","02/21/2014","01/31/2019","addiction; Address; Adult; Affect; Algorithms; Amygdaloid structure; Anatomy; Animal Model; Animals; Anxiety; Architecture; Argipressin; Attention; autism spectrum disorder; Autistic Disorder; Axon; basal forebrain; Basal Ganglia; Beds; Behavior; Biological Markers; Brain; brain behavior; brain circuitry; Cell Nucleus; Child; Color; Computational Science; Confocal Microscopy; connectome; cost; Data Set; Disease; Dreams; emotion dysregulation; Emotional; emotional behavior; Engineering; Equilibrium; Face; Family; Fluorescence; fluorescence imaging; Foundations; Gene Expression; gene product; Genes; Genetic; Goals; GTF2IRD1 gene; Hereditary Disease; Human; Human Genetics; Hypothalamic structure; Image; image reconstruction; image registration; Imagery; Immunohistochemistry; in vivo; Information Sciences; Information Systems; innovation; insight; Knowledge; Label; Life; Ligands; Link; Macaca; Macaca fascicularis; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Maps; Medicine; Mental Depression; Mental disorders; Microscopy; Modernization; Molecular; Mosaicism; multidisciplinary; neural circuit; Neuroanatomy; Neurobiology; Neurons; Neuropeptide Gene; Neuropeptides; Neurotransmitters; new therapeutic target; nonhuman primate; novel; novel marker; novel strategies; novel therapeutics; Oxytocin; Phenotype; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders; prevent; Primates; public health relevance; receptor; reconstruction; relating to nervous system; Resolution; response; Rodent; Role; Schizophrenia; Slice; social; Social Behavior; Social Behavior Disorders; Social Controls; Social Network; Speed; Stimulus; Structure; Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region; Synapses; System; targeted treatment; Technology; terabyte; Therapeutic; therapeutic target; Time; tool; tractography; Translating; United States National Institutes of Health; Vasopressins; Vasotocin; Vision; Williams Syndrome; ","Multiscale Genetic Connectivity of Primate Social Circuits","100635","NOIT","Neuroscience and Ophthalmic Imaging Technologies Study Section ","","","04","426929","209195","636124",""

There is interest in developing vaccines that could keep a pregnant woman from contracting a CMV infection that might injure her baby. Strategies for vaccination against CMV can be tested in animals, such as guinea pigs, to help understand what would be the best human vaccines. We are going to use a guinea pig model of congenital CMV infection to compare a CMV gB protein vaccine with what we believe will be an improved vaccine based on a complex of CMV proteins called the 'endocytic complex'. We will compare vaccines for protection against infection, protection against virally induced hearing loss, and for protection against re- infection of immune animals with new strains of CMV.","1919561; ","SCHLEISS, MARK R.;","KOSO-THOMAS, MARION ","08/06/2015","05/31/2020","Address; Adjuvant; Adjuvant Study; Adult; Animal Model; Animals; Antibodies; Antibody Response; Antigens; Area; Auditory Evoked Potentials; Biological; Biological Assay; Blood; Cavia; Cells; Child health care; Chile; Clinical; Clinical Trials; Collaborations; comparative; comparative efficacy; Complex; Conceptions; congenital cytomegalovirus; congenital infection; Contracts; cytokine; Cytomegalovirus; Cytomegalovirus Infections; Cytomegalovirus Vaccines; Data; Defect; Development; disability; Disease; Dose; efficacy study; Embryo; Endothelial Cells; enzyme linked immunospot assay; Epithelial Cells; Epitope Mapping; Epitopes; Evaluation; Event; experimental study; Female of child bearing age; fetal; fetal infection; Fetus; Future; Generations; Genome; Glycoproteins; Goals; Guinea pig cytomegalovirus; Harvest; head-to-head comparison; Health; hearing impairment; Homologous Gene; Homologous Protein; Host Defense; Human; Humor; Immune; Immune response; Immunity; Immunization; Immunize; Immunocompetent; improved; Infant; Infection; injured; Injury; interest; Knowledge; Labyrinthitis; Length; Leukocytes; Maternal Mortality; Mediating; MF59; Modeling; Modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara; Molecular Conformation; Monitor; mortality; Neonatal; Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1; Newborn Infant; Outcome; parallelization; Placenta; placental infection; pre-clinical; Pre-Clinical Model; Pregnancy; Pregnant Women; prenatal; prevent; Proteins; public health priorities; public health relevance; pup; recombinant virus; Recombinants; response; Risk; Sensorineural Hearing Loss; seropositive; Spontaneous Otoacoustic Emissions; Spottings; stem; Subunit Vaccines; Testing; transmission process; United States; Vaccination; vaccination strategy; vaccine efficacy; vaccine trial; Vaccines; vector; vector-based vaccine; Viral; Viral Load result; Virus; Woman; young woman; ","Optimized Vaccines Against Congenital Infection and Maternal Reinfection with CMV","079918","VMD","Vaccines Against Microbial Diseases Study Section ","","","03","236550","86320","322870",""

However, the mechanisms underlying the age-related declines in motor activity remain unclear. Our previous studies in C. elegans have suggested that such decline might primarily result from a progressive decay in the function of the synaptic exocytosis at the neuromuscular junctions (NMJs).

Comprehensive knowledge about mutable barriers to primary statin nonadherence among different groups of patients is a requisite first step to developing interventions that can address this important gap in our national cardiovascular prevention strategy.","7901583; ","TARN, DERJUNG M;","ONKEN, LISA ","06/15/2017","05/31/2019","Address; Adherence; Adverse effects; Age; American; Attitude; Behavior; Belief; California; Cardiovascular Diseases; cardiovascular disorder risk; Cardiovascular system; Characteristics; Cholesterol; Clinical Data; Clinical Research; Cognitive; cohort; Communication; Comprehension; cost; Cross-Sectional Studies; Data; Databases; demographics; Dependency; design; Elements; Eligibility Determination; Evaluation; Feeling; Focus Groups; Fright; Future; Goals; Guidelines; Health; health belief; Health Care Costs; health literacy; Health Personnel; Health system; Healthcare; Healthcare Systems; Hispanics; Individual; Industry; inhibitor/antagonist; Internet; Intervention; Interview; Knowledge; Language; Latino; Measures; Medical; Medical Records; Medical Societies; medication compliance; Methods; middle age; Minority; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Motivation; Myocardial Infarction; older patient; Oxidoreductase; Patient Preferences; Patients; Perception; Performance; personalized approach; Persons; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacology; Phase; Physicians; Population; prevent; Prevention strategy; Primary Prevention; Provider; Public Health; Reporting; Research; Risk; Risk Factors; Risk Reduction; Standardization; stem; stroke; Structure; Suggestion; Surveys; Testing; Treatment Factor; United States; Universities; willingness; ","Patient perspectives on primary statin nonadherence","055832","BMIO","Behavioral Medicine, Interventions and Outcomes Study Section ","","","01","179250","25532","204782",""

However, when the cell is subjected to internal and external stress, this compartment fails to fold proteins and unfolded proteins accumulate within it, a situation that, if unfixed, would result in the disruption of many essential cellular processes. In order to remedy this situation, cells responds by activating a signaling pathway termed the unfolded proteins response (UPR) that mediates cleavage of messenger RNAs (or mRNAs) to prevent the production of proteins and thereby mitigate ER stress. In this proposal, we will address how the UPR selectively finds and cleaves its mRNA substrates while avoid cleaving other cellular mRNAs.

We will utilize this screen to first identify those IBD-associated polymorphisms contributing to PRR-initiated cytokines, and then dissect the mechanisms wherein both the genes and the specific polymorphisms within the genes modulate PRR-initiated cytokine secretion. Given the primary role that modulation of cytokine expression has played thus far in the treatment of IBD, we anticipate that studies focused on disease-associated polymorphisms that modulate cytokine secretion will ultimately result in the improved targeting and prioritization of new therapeutic targets for IBD.","2574869; ","ABRAHAM, CLARA ;","KARP, ROBERT W","09/18/2013","05/31/2018","Autoimmune Process; Autoimmunity; Automobile Driving; Cells; cohort; Crohn's disease; cytokine; Dendritic Cells; density; Development; Disease; Equilibrium; functional outcomes; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Polymorphism; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genetic Variation; Human; human disease; Human Genetics; Immune response; immunoregulation; improved; Individual; Infection; Inflammatory; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; innovation; insight; inter-individual variation; knock-down; macrophage; Mediating; Microbe; Microbial Genetics; Molecular; monocyte; mycobacterial; new therapeutic target; novel; novel therapeutics; Outcome; Pathway interactions; Pattern recognition receptor; Play; Predisposition; protein expression; public health relevance; Receptor Activation; Risk; Role; Signal Pathway; Single Nucleotide Polymorphism; STAT3 gene; System; Testing; Toll-like receptors; Transcript; Ulcerative Colitis; Variant; Viral; ","Functional outcomes of inflammatory bowel disease associated variants","099097","ZDK1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","05","217500","144638","362138",""

Identifying the mechanisms by which brain cells meet energetic demand is important for understanding brain function and the progression of several neurodegenerative diseases like AD. Optical imaging is perhaps the only existing method to nondestructively measure brain tissue with subcellular resolution. This project will use two-photon/ lifetime microscopy to measure and correlate three distinct markers of cerebral metabolism and cellular signaling in vivo with high spatial and temporal resolution. The results will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the metabolic deficits brought about by AD progression, and they will guide development of new preventative strategies and drug screening techniques to mitigate the degradative effects of AD.","10310637; ","YASEEN, MOHAMMAD ABBAS;","WISE, BRADLEY C.","09/30/2015","05/31/2018","Adult; Age; age group; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's disease model; amyloid peptide; Animal Model; Astrocytes; ATP Synthesis Pathway; Boa; Brain; brain cell; brain tissue; Calcium; Cell Respiration; cerebral oxygenation; Cerebrum; Complex; Computer software; Consumption; Coupled; Custom; Detection; Development; Disease; Disease Progression; effective therapy; Elderly; Electrons; Endoplasmic Reticulum; Energy Metabolism; Engineering; Ensure; Enzymes; Exposure to; Family; Fluorescence; fluorescence lifetime imaging; Formulation; Glucose; Glycolysis; Homeostasis; human disease; Human Pathology; Imaging Device; imaging system; Impairment; in vivo; in vivo imaging; Incidence; insight; instrumentation; Investigation; Knowledge; Laboratories; Measurement; Measures; Mentors; Metabolic; Metabolic Marker; Metabolic Pathway; Metabolism; Methods; Microscope; Microscopic; Microscopy; Mitochondria; mitochondrial dysfunction; mitochondrial metabolism; Modeling; Monitor; mouse model; Mus; NADH; Nature; Nerve Degeneration; Neurodegenerative Disorders; Neurofibrillary Tangles; Neurons; Neurosciences; Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; normal aging; novel; novel diagnostics; optical imaging; Optics; Oxidative Phosphorylation; Oxidative Stress; Oxygen; Oxygen Consumption; Partial Pressure; Pathogenesis; Pathology; Pd-porphyrin; peptide A; Phosphorescent Assays; Physiological Processes; Population; Populations at Risk; Preclinical Drug Evaluation; Prevention strategy; Preventive therapy; Process; public health relevance; Reaction; Reagent; Regulation; Research; Research Personnel; Resolution; Respiration; Signal Transduction; Solid; Source; success; Synaptic Transmission; Systems Biology; Techniques; Technology; temporal measurement; Therapeutic; therapy development; tool; Training; Transgenic Mice; two-photon; ","In Vivo Imaging Alzheimers Disease Pathology with 2-Photon/Lifetime Microscopy","042026","NSS","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","05","143465","105535","249000",""

Growing evidence suggests that prenatal exposure to androgens could be a source of fetal programming leading to the development of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in later adult life. Although numerous prenatally androgenized animal models have demonstrated cardiometabolic impairments in adulthood, data linking prenatal androgen exposure to long-term adult cardiovascular risk outcomes in the general human population has not been well studied. Using a unique human birth cohort, this proposal will take a life-course perspective to investigate the relationship between prenatal maternal androgens to offspring early childhood indicators of growth and test their impact on predicting cardiometabolic risk in adulthood. The information obtained from this study will provide novel and unique information highlighting a potential mechanism for adverse cardiometabolic outcomes as a consequence of prenatal androgen exposure.","11360528; ","HUANG, GRACE ;","LUDLAM, SHARI ","06/15/2017","03/31/2021","7 year old; Adult; Adult Children; Adverse effects; Age; Age-Years; Androgen Receptor; Androgenization; Androgens; Animal Model; Animals; Biological Assay; Biological Markers; Birth; Blood Pressure; Boston; cardiometabolic risk; Cardiovascular Diseases; cardiovascular disorder risk; cardiovascular risk factor; Cardiovascular system; Central obesity; Childhood; Clinical; clinically relevant; cohort; Communities; critical developmental period; Data; Development; Dyslipidemias; early childhood; Endocrine disruption; Endocrine Disruptors; Environmental Risk Factor; exposed human population; Exposure to; Family Study; fasting glucose; Female; fetal; Fetal Growth; Fetal Growth Retardation; fetal programming; follow-up; Functional disorder; genetic association; Genetic Risk; glucose metabolism; Goals; Growth; Health; Human; human disease; Hypertension; Impairment; in utero; Individual; Insulin Resistance; interest; Intervention; Investigation; Life; Life Cycle Stages; Link; Lipids; Liquid Chromatography; Low Birth Weight Infant; male; Massachusetts; maternal serum; Measures; Mediating; Metabolic; Metabolic Diseases; Metabolic syndrome; mortality; Mothers; New England; novel; Obesity; obesity in children; offspring; Outcome; Participant; Pathway interactions; Patients; Perinatal; Play; Polycystic Ovary Syndrome; Population; postnatal; Pregnancy; pregnant; Pregnant Women; prenatal; prenatal exposure; primary outcome; public health relevance; Receptor Signaling; Recruitment Activity; Resources; Rhode Island; Risk Factors; Role; Serum; sex; Sex Characteristics; Site; Source; Surrogate Markers; tandem mass spectrometry; targeted treatment; Testing; Testosterone; therapeutic target; Third Pregnancy Trimester; trait; Variant; ","Prenatal Androgens and Cardiometabolic Risk in Adulthood","132122","MCBS","NHLBI Mentored Clinical and Basic Science Review Committee ","","A1","01","119841","8944","128785",""

Unfortunately, at present this is not the case and ?missed lesions?, i.e. large polyps or colorectal cancer, sometimes are detected shortly after a ?negative? colonoscopy. Several patient-, equipment- and endoscopist-related factors may be responsible for this. We and most colorectal cancer experts believe that the endoscopist-related factors, in particular endoscopist technique, are most important as the endoscopist can mitigate unfavorable conditions related to patient- or equipment-related conditions.  We have developed software able to derive quality metrics about endoscopist-related factors from streaming video during colonoscopy and immediately inform the endoscopist about the results, i.e., provide real-time feedback. In other words, we have created a system that has the potential to improve endoscopic technique during a colonoscopy in a live patient. Now we propose to optimize the method whereby we provide feedback related to technique to the endoscopist and then to test whether giving feedback indeed results in better technique and at the same time in the discovery and removal of more polyps.  This year, approximately 14 million US citizens will undergo colonoscopy for a total cost of around $24 billion and about 50,000 patients will die of colorectal cancer. We strongly believe that use of our software will improve detection and prevention of colorectal cancer.","1966329; ","DE GROEN, PIET C;","HAMILTON, FRANK A","08/01/2016","05/31/2020","Abdomen; Address; adenoma; Adherence; American; Anatomy; Arthroscopy; Biology; Bronchoscopy; Canada; Cancer Etiology; Cessation of life; college; Colon; Colonoscopy; Colorectal Cancer; colorectal cancer prevention; colorectal cancer screening; Computational algorithm; computer infrastructure; Computer software; Consensus; cost; Cystoscopy; Data; Detection; Distal; Dysplasia; Endoscopy; Ensure; Equipment; Evaluation; Excision; Feces; Feedback; Gastroenterology; Gastrointestinal Endoscopy; Germany; Guidelines; Human; Image; improved; Left; Lesion; Longitudinal Studies; Malignant Neoplasms; Measurement; Measures; Medical; Methods; millisecond; Modality; Monitor; Mucous Membrane; novel; operation; Operative Surgical Procedures; Patients; Phase; Polyps; Premalignant; Preparation; prevent; Procedures; protective effect; Quality of Care; Rectum; Reporting; Research Infrastructure; response; S-Adenosylmethionine; screening; Side; Societies; software development; Stream; Surveillance Program; System; Techniques; Technology; Testing; theories; Therapeutic; Time; Withdrawal; ","REAL-TIME FEEDBACK TO IMPROVE COLONOSCOPY","106130","NRCS","Nursing and Related Clinical Sciences Study Section ","","","02","591460","99069","690529",""

The most common strategy for terminating VF is with a single, large, biphasic high-energy (HE) electric shock by an Implantable Cardiac Defibrillator (ICD). Despite their effectiveness, there have been increasing concerns with current ICD design, due to cardiac tissue damage likely induced by high voltage shocks, pain caused by inappropriate shocks, and short battery life. Redesign and optimization of shock waveforms is critical for developing a low-energy defibrillator that will be more acceptable to patients and clinicians. The high voltage ICD market segment includes single and dual chamber ICDs and cardiac resynchronization devices (CRT-D), and is a $6.5B global ICD market. Despite strong clinical evidence of comparative benefits of ICD therapy in multiple published studies, it is estimated that two in three patients who might benefit from an ICD do not receive this proven life- saving therapy. Cardialen proposes to resolve life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias using a novel three- phased sequence of low energy electrotherapy during VF to restore normal cardiac rhythm without damaging cardiac tissue or causing psychological trauma associated with high voltage therapy.","8445949; 1875347; 14365916 (contact); ","COOPER, DANIEL H; EFIMOV, IGOR R; SHELTON, MICHAEL BRENT (contact);","TINSLEY, EMILY ","02/15/2011","04/30/2019","Ablation; Achievement; Address; American; Animals; Arrhythmia; Atrial Fibrillation; Canis familiaris; Cardiac; Cause of Death; Cicatrix; Clinical; clinical development; commercialization; comparative; Computer software; Death, Sudden, Cardiac; Defibrillators; design; Devices; Disease; Effectiveness; Electric Countershock; electric field; Electric Stimulation Therapy; Electrodes; Eligibility Determination; Energy Therapy; Heart Atrium; heart rhythm; Heterogeneity; Human; Implantable Defibrillators; In Vitro; in vivo; insight; Killings; Life; Methods; Modality; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; next generation; novel; Optics; Pain; Patients; Phase; Physiologic pulse; Population; Positioning Attribute; pre-clinical; prevent; product development; psychological trauma; Publishing; Refractory; Research; S Phase; Safety; Savings; Shock; Small Business Innovation Research Grant; Small Business Technology Transfer Research; Sudden Death; symptom treatment; System; Systems Development; Tachyarrhythmias; Tachycardia; Testing; theories; Tissues; Translating; United States; United States National Institutes of Health; Ventricular; Ventricular Arrhythmia; Ventricular Fibrillation; Ventricular Tachycardia; virtual; voltage; Work; ","Unpinning Termination Therapy for Ventricular Tachyarrhythmias","107055","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","","","1351728",""

In some, this results in respiratory infections. We propose that the bitter taste receptor T2R38 expressed in the airway senses bitter chemicals secreted by bacteria. When stimulated, this receptor triggers an antimicrobial response and eradicates the offending microbes. Thus, genetic differences in bitter taste receptor functionality may contribute to differences in the predisposition to airway infections.","8098814; ","COHEN, NOAM A;","SULLIVAN, SUSAN L.","06/01/2014","05/31/2019","Age; Agonist; Alleles; Anti-Bacterial Agents; antimicrobial; Bacteria; bactericide; Brain; Breathing; burden of illness; Cells; Chemicals; chronic rhinosinusitis; Clinical; cohort; Complex; Data; defense response; Detection; Diagnostic radiologic examination; Disease; enteric pathogen; Epithelial; Etiology; Exposure to; Failure; Frequencies; Functional disorder; Gender; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Polymorphism; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; genetic variant; Genetic Variation; Genotype; Goals; Gram-Negative Bacteria; high throughput screening; homoserine lactone; Human; Individual; Individual Differences; individual patient; Infection; Intervention; Killings; Ligands; Link; Measures; Medical; Microbe; microbial; Mucociliary Clearance; Mucosal Immunity; Natural Immunity; Nitric Oxide; Nose; Operative Surgical Procedures; Oral cavity; Outcome; pathogen; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pharmacology; Play; Predisposition; Prevalence; Process; Production; prognostic; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; public health relevance; Publishing; quorum sensing; Race; receptor; receptor function; respiratory; Respiratory Tract Infections; response; Role; screening; Sentinel; Severities; Severity of illness; Signal Transduction; Structure of respiratory epithelium; success; Symptoms; System; T2R taste receptors; Taste Buds; Taste Perception; Testing; Therapeutic; therapy outcome; Tissues; Variant; ","Chronic Rhinosinusitis and genetics of bitter taste receptors","013588","SCS","Somatosensory and Chemosensory Systems Study Section ","","S1","04","48284","29453","77737",""
