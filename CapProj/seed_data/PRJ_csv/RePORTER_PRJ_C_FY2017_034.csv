PROJECT NARRATIVE The cytoskeleton (?cell skeleton?) is crucial for shaping and moving our cells and organelles. As cells age, their ability to properly control these processes changes. This is especially true for kidney cells and immune cells, as a variety of renal and inflammatory diseases develop with age. However, the differences in cytoskeletal functions that give rise to these cellular changes during the aging process are poorly understood.

Here we will study a monogenic hemorrhagic stroke syndrome; Cerebral Cavernous Malformation (CCM). This syndrome has been increasingly recognized with the advent of MRI for diagnosis and is well represented in the Veteran population. Multiple studies confirm that CCM is found in 1 of every 200 persons, indicating that this disease potentially affects more than 100,000 Veterans. Our studies will employ cell culture, signaling, as well as ex vivo and in vivo systems to understand the mechanism of CCM and to develop new treatments for CCM and other forms of hemorrhagic stroke.

In particular, biomarkers that monitor disease progression and assess response to treatment can greatly improve clinical intervention and patient outcome. Such biomarkers are increasingly implemented for disease surveillance and monitoring treatment response and are referred to as 'companion diagnostics.' Since changes in cell adhesion and migration are critical to malignant dissemination and metastasis, it is reasonable to expect molecular mechanisms that support tumor cell motility are desirable therapeutic targets and promising indicators of molecular progression of cancer. We have identified Activated Leukocyte Cell Adhesion Molecule (ALCAM) as an important regulator of tumor cell motility and metastasis in both pre-clinical and mechanistic studies. We have demonstrated that ALCAM is a critical contributor to tumor cell metastasis. By analyzing ALCAM in the serum of tumor-bearing animals, we demonstrated that shedding of the extracellular domain of ALCAM corresponds to disease progression and tumor burden. Furthermore, we found significantly elevated ALCAM levels in both the urine and serum of patients with renal (RCC) and bladder (BCa) cancer. Based on our preliminary studies, we hypothesize that the proteolytic shedding of ALCAM contributes to disease progression and that 'shed' ALCAM is a biomarker of disease progression, as well as treatment response in urogenital cancers. The value of shed ALCAM as a biomarker is two-fold: 1) It is a mechanistic link to tumor cell migration and, subsequently, able to report on 'invasive' disease rather than merely the presence of cancer, and 2) The non-invasive detection of ALCAM in urine and serum offers longitudinal assessment of treatment response and disease progression. In addition, understanding how proteolytic processing of ALCAM contributes mechanistically to disease progression will reveal therapeutic approaches that can intervene in the malignant dissemination of cancer. We will address the following Specific Aims: 1. Determine the utility of shed ALCAM in monitoring recurrence and therapeutic response in patients with urogenital cancer. ALCAM is shed into adjacent biofluids such as blood and urine where its levels correlate with tumor burden and disease progression. If this biomarker can be used to accurately monitor patients with existing disease and report on the response to therapy, it can be used to guide clinical care in cancer patients. 2. Determine the mechanism by which ALCAM shedding contributes to the metastatic progression of BCa using a structure/function analysis. ALCAM is cleaved by two proteases, ADAM17 and ?-secretase, which results in the release of an extracellular (ECD) and intracellular (ICD) domain, respectively. Preliminary data in our laboratory suggests that these two ALCAM domains independently regulate cell adhesion, migration and survival differently from the intact protein. To elucidate the function of each domain in regards to tumor cell survival and migration, we will express 7 ALCAM constructs lacking the ECD, ICD and/or the transmembrane domain in bladder cancer cell lines and assess tumor cell survival, invasion, and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. 3. Identify the ADAM-mediated 'sheddome' of invasive BCa. The promiscuity of membrane proteases such as ADAMs and their established participation in tumor cell invasion suggests that identification of the ADAM-mediated 'sheddome' of invasive/metastatic bladder cancer would substantially contribute to the understanding of the mechanism of metastatic progression and provide additional fluid-based prognostic biomarkers that can be validated with cohorts from Aim 1. We will collect surface biotinylated proteins and utilized a targeted proteomics approach to identify those transmembrane proteins targeted by the ADAM family of proteases. Comparison across a panel of non-invasive verses invasive bladder cancer cell lines will identify the surface proteins shed by ADAMs in response to malignant progression.","10519254; ","ARNOLD, SHANNA ALEXANDRIA;","","10/01/2014","09/30/2019","Activated-Leukocyte Cell Adhesion Molecule; Address; Animals; base; Biological Markers; biomarker development; Bladder; Blood; burden of illness; Cancer cell line; Cancer Etiology; Cancer Patient; Cell Adhesion; cell motility; Cell Survival; Cell-Cell Adhesion; Cessation of life; chemotherapy; Cleaved cell; Clinical; clinical biomarkers; clinical care; cohort; companion diagnostics; Data; Diagnosis; Disease; Disease Progression; Dissociation; Excision; extracellular; Extracellular Domain; Family; Future; Health; Health Care Costs; Imaging Techniques; Immunotherapy; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; Institution; Integral Membrane Protein; Intervention; Kidney; Knowledge; Laboratories; Link; Liquid substance; Malignant - descriptor; Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder; Malignant Neoplasms; Managed Care; Mediating; Medical; Membrane; Membrane Proteins; Metastatic to; migration; Molecular; Monitor; Monitoring for Recurrence; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Neoplasm Metastasis; neoplastic cell; Non-Invasive Cancer Detection; Operative Surgical Procedures; Patient Monitoring; Patient-Focused Outcomes; Patients; Peptide Hydrolases; Pharmaceutical Preparations; pre-clinical; Primary Neoplasm; Prognostic Marker; Progressive Disease; Proteins; Proteolytic Processing; Proteomics; Recurrence; Reporting; response; Sampling; secretase; Serum; Specimen; Structure; Surface; Therapeutic; therapeutic target; Toxic effect; Transmembrane Domain; treatment response; tumor; Tumor Burden; Tumor Cell Invasion; Tumor Cell Migration; tumor progression; Urine; Urogenital Cancer; ","ALCAM as a Biomarker of Treatment Response and Progression in Urogenital Cancers","002498","ONCA","Oncology A ","","","03","","","",""

The Veteran population also has a frequent need for potent analgesics, be it for perioperative pain control or chronic pain from trauma, degenerative diseases or cancer. These drugs can cause serious respiratory depression leading to inadequate brain oxygen, loss of consciousness and even death. Pharmacological strategies to restore respiratory function in these settings have been lacking due to a lack of detailed understanding of central respiratory control mechanisms and the effects of opioids and sedatives on it.

The overall 5-yr survival for colorectal cancer in the US is 61% compared to 41% for Veterans. It arises through the acquisition of multiple, independent genetic modifications in crypt epithelial stem cells. Identifying these stem cells and understanding the mechanisms that regulate the gastrointestinal (GI) epithelium will potentially improve our ability to treat and prevent GI malignancies particularly in the Veteran population.

Military personnel in the Middle East and Latin America are at high risk for leishmaniasis. Indeed, major outbreaks of leishmaniasis affected hundreds of military personnel during recent operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. New forms of leishmaniasis are emerging and the incidence of disease is increasing, but our limited knowledge of disease pathogenesis and limited repertoire of drugs leaves us ill-prepared for this disease. We propose in this application to carefully examine the pathologic immune responses that allow Leishmania to survive in a host.

Upon injury, HSCs undergo myofibroblastic trans- differentiation (MTD) to participate in scar formation and cause liver fibrosis and cirrhosis if injury is sustained. Our research to date demonstrates this MTD is caused by re-activation of morphogens such as Necdin, Wnt, and delta-like homolog (DLK1). Necdin directly upregulates Wnt10b via its binding to a putative Necdin site (GN box) of the canonical Wnt10b promoter. Wnt10b and DLK1 positively cross-regulate each other and epigenetically repress the HSC quiescence gene Ppar? to drive HSC MTD. This epigenetic regulation is caused by increased levels of the methyl-CpG binding protein MeCP2 which binds to the Ppar? promoter to recruit HDAC and the co-repressor HP-1? while stimulating expression of EZH2 for consequent H3K27 di- or tri-methylation at the 3' exons to silence the gene. Our results also suggest that canonical Wnt pathway increases MeCP2 protein via suppression of miR-212 and miR-132 which normally block MeCP2 translation. We also demonstrate HSCs transiently activated in liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy express DLK1 which stimulates hepatocyte DLK1 expression via a paracrine manner to support early liver growth. This notion of HSC-hepatocyte crosstalk with DLK1 is also supported by our preliminary results in acute CCl4 injury model indicating initial DLK1 induction by activated HSCs is followed by DLK1 induction in regenerating hepatocytes.  To extend our research, we will test the hypotheses: 1) canonical Wnt pathway activates HSCs via downregulation of miR-212 and miR-132 and consequent MeCP2-mediated Ppar? epigenetic repression and 2) HSC-derived DLK1 is a novel mitogen which initiates liver regeneration via HSC-hepatocyte crosstalk. We will test the causality of reduced miR-212/132 in Wnt-mediated MeCP2 induction by expressing miR-212/132 mimics or anti-miR-212/132 under canonical Wnt antagonism or activation in HSCs (Aim 1a and b). Once the causality is established, we will determine whether or how canonical Wnt pathway epigenetically or transcriptionally repress miR-212/132 (Aim 1-c and d). To test the novel mitogenic role of DLK1, acute and chronic CCl4 mouse models will be used to determine temporal and cell-type specific expression of DLK1 by immunostaining and analysis of isolated HSCs vs. hepatocytes and to test the effects of anti-DLK1 antibody administration on liver fibrosis and regeneration (Aim 2-a and b). To determine respective roles of DLK expressed by activated HSCs vs. hepatocytes, we will render acute and chronic CCl4 hepatotoxicity to compound mice generated from Dlk1+(m)/flox(p) mice crossed with ?1(I) collagen promoter-Cre or Albumin-Cre mice to determine the effects of respective conditional knockout on liver fibrosis and regeneration. Collectively, these efforts will define upstream mechanisms of MeCP2 upregulation responsible for Ppar? repression in HSC MTD and the role of HSC-derived DLK1 in liver fibrosis and regeneration, and provide new insights into potential therapeutic targets for chronic liver disease.","2105294; ","TSUKAMOTO, HIDEKAZU ;","","10/01/2013","09/30/2017","Acute; adipocyte differentiation; Albumins; Antibodies; Binding; Biological; Boxing; Cell Fate Control; cell type; Cells; Chronic; chronic liver disease; Cicatrix; Collaborations; Collagen; Down-Regulation; Epigenetic Process; epigenetic regulation; Etiology; Exons; EZH2 gene; Funding; Gene Silencing; Genes; Genetic Transcription; Goals; Growth; Health; Hepatic; Hepatic Fibrogenesis; Hepatic Stellate Cell; Hepatocyte; Hepatotoxicity; Histone Deacetylase; Homologous Gene; Injury; insight; Knock-out; Knockout Mice; Laboratories; Liver; Liver Cirrhosis; Liver Fibrosis; liver injury; Liver Regeneration; Mediating; Mesenchymal; Messenger RNA; Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2; Methylation; MicroRNAs; Mitogens; Modeling; Molecular; morphogens; mouse model; Mus; Natural regeneration; necdin; novel; paracrine; Partial Hepatectomy; Pathway interactions; Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors; Phase; Play; promoter; Proteins; Published Comment; Recovery; Recruitment Activity; Regulation; Repression; Research; response; restoration; Role; selective expression; Site; stellate cell; Testing; therapeutic target; Transcriptional Regulation; Translations; Up-Regulation; wound; ","Molecular Mechanisms of Stellate Cell Activation in Liver Fibrosis","001991","GAST","Gastroenterology ","","","04","","","",""

Most of it was obtained using the Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigm. This approach fostered the view that the amygdala generates emotional behaviors in an automatic, stimulus-driven manner. However, this paradigm suffers from severe limitations, which are still unappreciated in the field. First, it usually allows for only one conditioned behavior (CR; freezing). As a result, it looks as if the conditioned stimulus (CS) automatically triggers the CR when in fact that's all this paradigm allows. Second, because conditioning changes the likelihood that the CS will elicit the CR, it is difficult to determine whether training-induced alterations in activity are related to the valence or identity of CSs, to the behaviors they elicit, or a mixture thereof. In fact, our recent work indicates that BL activity is closely tied to behavioral output and coincidentally related to threat and reward contingencies. These results imply that even after experience has led to the potentiation of sensory inputs to the amygdala, the coupling of sensory events to emotional behaviors is not fixed but potentially malleable, a prospect of great translational significance. Thus, we propose to re-examine how amygdala neurons control defensive and reward-seeking behaviors using a novel task that allows one to compare, in the same rats and neurons, activity related to multiple conditioned behaviors. Only though such experiments can we really ascertain the role of the amygdala in the negative valence system.

A key virulence factor of P. aeruginosa during pulmonary infection is the production of a capsule-like exopolysaccharide called alginate. A better understanding of the complex mechanisms involved in alginate biosynthesis could lead to novel therapies.

It is a complex disorder influenced by genetic and environmental factors and their interactive influences, but knowledge on specific genetic factors that underlie variation in T2D is still limited. Therefore, the major objective of this study is to identify potetial functional variants influencing T2D and its related traits. The ability to identify individuals wit elevated susceptibility to T2D would be critical to initiating effective early prevention strategie or to treat individuals in these at-risk groups.

Although multiple isolated seizure outcome predictors have been identified, the ability to synthesize a wealth of pre-surgical testing data into an individualized and comprehensive outcome prediction remains essentially subjective. We recently published an epilepsy surgery nomogram or ESN (statistical tool) developed and validated on a retrospective cohort of close to 1,500 patients allowing the synthesis of six clinical characteristics to predict seizure-freedom at two and five years after resective epilepsy surgery. In this grant application, we will enhance this nomogram by adding data from the main pillars of a presurgical evaluation: electroencephalography (EEG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET). We will develop and compare different versions of the ?enhanced? nomogram: one version that relies on easily ascertainable, qualitatively determined datapoints (qualitative ESN) and other versions that use sophisticated quantitative measures obtained from post-processing of the EEG, MRI, surgical pathology, genetics, and PET (quantitative ESN). The ESN will be developed from a retrospective cohort of 450 patients from Cleveland Clinic, Mayo Clinic, and University of Campinas, and prospectively validated in a cohort of 250 patients from the same centers. When completed, this project will generate the first objective, validated, user-friendly, and scalable tool to predict individualized postoperative seizure outcomes. Achieving this goal will improve individual patient counseling and benefit public health by providing an objective tool to stratify disease severity by ?expected outcomes?, helping with streamlining care and resource allocation.","10787842; ","JEHI, LARA ;","STEWART, RANDALL R","05/15/2017","04/30/2022","Age; Applications Grants; base; Brain imaging; Caring; Characteristics; Classification; Clinic; Clinical; cohort; Complex; Convulsions; Counseling; Data; Decision Making; Development; Diagnostic; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Discrimination; Drug resistance; Electroencephalography; Epilepsy; Etiology; Evaluation; Family history of; Freedom; Frequencies; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; gene panel; Generic Drugs; Genetic; Goals; Gold; Handedness; hazard; improved; individual patient; Judgment; Lead; Lobe; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Measurement; Measures; Methodology; Methods; Modeling; Multicenter Studies; neuroimaging; Neurology; Nomograms; Operative Surgical Procedures; Outcome; outcome prediction; Partial Epilepsies; Patient Care; Patients; Pattern; Performance; personalized medicine; Physicians; Positron-Emission Tomography; Postoperative Period; predictive modeling; Process; prognostic assays; Prognostic Marker; prospective; Public Health; Publishing; Quantitative Evaluations; Recording of previous events; Recruitment Activity; Resource Allocation; Rest; Retrospective cohort; Risk; Sampling; Seizures; Severity of illness; sex; Site; standard care; Statistical Models; statistics; study population; success; Surgical Pathology; Testing; Time; tool; treatment choice; Uncertainty; Universities; user-friendly; Validation; Work; ","A Nomogram to Predict Seizure Outcomes after Resective Epilepsy Surgery","097719","ANIE","Acute Neural Injury and Epilepsy Study Section ","","A1","01","394763","179202","573965",""

Sub-clinical vitamin C (ascorbic acid, ascorbate) deficiency is a widespread among veteran populations, particularly in the elderly. Ascorbate depletion can accelerate several of the degeneration processes involved in Alzheimer's disease through specific oxidative stress pathways. We propose a novel pathway that highlights the role of ascorbate release in the glutamate clearance mechanism by astrocytes. Thus ascorbate deficiency can uniquely contribute to glutamate toxicity during hyperexcitability events, i.e. seizures. Better understanding of this mechanism will lead to improvement treatment plans and therapeutic targets both in Alzheimer's disease and in other cases in which seizures are common that may also reflect glutamate clearance problems, including following Traumatic Brain Injury.","1877106; ","MAY, JAMES M.;","","04/01/2017","03/31/2021","abeta accumulation; Abeta synthesis; Acute; Aging; Agonist; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's disease model; Amyloid; Animal Model; Animals; Antioxidants; ascorbate; Ascorbic Acid; Astrocytes; Atherosclerosis; Behavioral; Blood; Brain; brain tissue; Caregivers; Caring; Ceftriaxone; Cell Death; Chronic; Clinical; clinically relevant; Coculture Techniques; Cognitive; cognitive ability; cognitive function; Comorbidity; cost; Coupled; Culture Media; Culture Techniques; Data; Deterioration; Diabetes Mellitus; Diet; Disease; DNA Sequence Alteration; Dose; Elderly; Electroencephalography; Employee Strikes; Ensure; Epilepsy; Equilibrium; Event; Excitatory Amino Acid Transporter 2; excitotoxicity; experimental study; Exposure to; Extracellular Fluid; Failure; familial Alzheimer disease; functional outcomes; Genetic; Glutamates; Goals; Gulo; Health; Home environment; Human; Impaired cognition; improved; Intake; Investigation; Kainic Acid; Lead; Liver; Measures; Mitochondria; Modeling; Modification; mouse model; mRNA Expression; Mus; Mutation; Nerve Degeneration; neuronal survival; Neurons; neuropathology; neurotoxic; novel; outcome forecast; oxidative damage; Oxidative Stress; Oxidative Stress Pathway; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; patient population; Pattern; Phenotype; Population; Predisposition; presenilin-1; Prevalence; Process; Property; Quality of life; Reactive Oxygen Species; relating to nervous system; Rodent; Rodent Model; Role; Seizures; Severities; Signal Transduction; Smoking; Speed; Supplementation; Synapses; synaptic failure; System; tau Proteins; Telemetry; Testing; therapeutic target; Toxic effect; Traumatic Brain Injury; treatment planning; Up-Regulation; uptake; Veterans; Wireless Technology; ","Failure of the glutamate uptake-ascorbic acid exchange drives seizure susceptibility and severity","001610","NURD","Neurobiology D ","","","01","","","",""

Additionally, using a genetic approach, we will modify the conditions in the surroundings of these brain cells in old mice as they learn new strategies and transfer knowledge to new situations, and if successful, our studies will show that similar modifications can be used as a therapeutic strategy in humans to delay the onset and decline in brain performance and provide aging humans with a more independent and better quality of life.","11627719; ","MOSTANY, RICARDO ;","WISE, BRADLEY C.","09/15/2016","04/30/2021","Accidents; Action Potentials; Adult; Affect; Age; age related; aged; Aging; aging brain; Area; Attention; Behavioral; Brain; brain cell; Cerebral cortex; Country; Dendritic Spines; density; Development; dexterity; Elderly; Electrophysiology (science); Equilibrium; excitatory neuron; executive function; Experimental Models; Fatal injury; Forelimb; Future; genetic approach; Goals; hippocampal pyramidal neuron; Human; human subject; Image; improved; in vivo; Inferior; Injury; innovation; Interneurons; Knowledge; Learning; Life; Maintenance; Mediating; Memory; memory recall; Microscopy; Modification; Motor; Motor Cortex; motor learning; Mus; Neocortex; Neurodegenerative Disorders; neuromechanism; Neurons; normal aging; optogenetics; Output; Parvalbumins; patch clamp; Performance; Population; prevent; Quality of life; Research; sensory discrimination; Social Welfare; somatosensory; Somatosensory Cortex; Synapses; Synaptic plasticity; Techniques; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Intervention; therapy design; Time; Training; Transgenic Mice; transmission process; two-photon; Vibrissae; Viral Vector; ","Cortical Synaptic Dynamics during Learning  in the Aging Brain","047296","CNNT","Clinical Neuroplasticity and Neurotransmitters Study Section ","","","02","184500","93172","277672",""

Approximately 64,000 new cases and 14,000 deaths attributable to kidney cancer are anticipated for 2014. As a disease common to elderly males, it substantially contributes to the morbidity and mortality of our Veterans. At the metastatic stage, the disease is essentially incurable, and current therapies have met with modest success. Inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene is characteristic of the overwhelming majority (~90%) of sporadic cases of clear cell RCC. Unfortunately, gene therapy approaches to tumor suppressor gene replacement are not clinically feasible. Our proposal seeks to establish that a critical signaling protein known as TAK1, which is hyperactivated in response to VHL inactivation, is a viable molecular target. As a kinase, TAK1 is a classic 'druggable' target that can potentially be developed for the clinical management of clear cell RCC, and thereby modify the course of this devastating disease.","2278789; ","RETTIG, MATTHEW B;","","10/01/2015","09/30/2019","Age; Apoptotic; Area; attributable mortality; base; Biochemical; Biological Assay; Cancer Etiology; CCI-779; Cells; Cessation of life; Characteristics; Clear Cell; Clinic; Clinical; Clinical Data; clinical development; Clinical Management; clinical translation; Data; Disease; Down-Regulation; drug development; Elderly; Freezing; Gene Expression; Gene Proteins; gene replacement; gene replacement therapy; gene therapy; Genes; Goals; Growth; Hypoxia Inducible Factor; Image Analysis; Immunohistochemistry; In Vitro; in vivo; Inflammatory Response; Inherited; inhibitor/antagonist; Kidney; kidney cortex; Kidney Neoplasms; male; Malignant Neoplasms; MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase; MAP3K7 gene; MAPK8 gene; Mediating; meetings; men; Molecular; Molecular Target; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; multicatalytic endopeptidase complex; N-terminal; neoplastic cell; NF-kappa B; novel; Outcome; Pathway interactions; Patients; Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases; Phosphotransferases; Physiological; pre-clinical; Pre-Clinical Model; prevent; Primary Neoplasm; Process; programs; protein expression; Proteins; public health relevance; Publishing; Renal carcinoma; Renal Cell Carcinoma; Research; response; restoration; Role; sample collection; Sampling; Signal Transduction; Signaling Protein; small hairpin RNA; small molecule; small molecule inhibitor; Source; Specimen; Staging; success; System; Testing; Therapeutic; therapeutic target; therapy development; Tissue Microarray; transcription factor; Transforming Growth Factors; Translating; Translations; tumor; tumor initiation; Tumor Suppressor Genes; tumorigenesis; tumorigenic; Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor; ubiquitin-protein ligase; Validation; Variant; Veterans; ","HIF-alpha-independent Druggable Targets in Renal Cell Carcinoma","002778","ONCA","Oncology A ","","","02","","","",""

Moreover, these drugs are ineffective against the latent reservoir. Latent reservoir cells do not produce HIV while antiretroviral drugs are present. If patients were to stop taking these drugs, HIV production resumes and the resultant virus can infect new cells. We will attack HIV on several fronts simultaneously by (i) using anti-HIV antibodies to bind to and remove both HIV and HIV- infected cells, (ii) destroying the gene that makes a cell surface protein termed CCR5 that is required for HIV to infect a cell, and (iii) destroying the ability of a latent HIV infected cell to produce new viral particles.

Cigarette smoking and potentially the use of smokeless tobacco are associated with an increase in CVD risk factors. Nonetheless, tobacco constituents that mediate the cardiovascular toxicity of tobacco use remain unknown, and therefore, it is unclear how tobacco products could be regulated to reduce cardiovascular injury or how Potential Reduced Exposure Tobacco Products (PREPs) such as electronic cigarettes could be evaluated for cardiovascular toxicity.

Due to advances in mechanical ventilatory and fluid strategies, the outcomes of ARDS patients have improved significantly over the last decade. The goal of this new NHLBI PETAL initiative is to test therapies that will either prevent the development of ARDS in patients at risk for developing the syndrome, or improve outcomes for patients with early ARDS. The University of Colorado Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care and Department of Emergency Medicine have previously collaborated on clinical initiatives including optimizing the transition of care for critically ill patients from the Emergency Department to the Intensive Care Units. In addition, investigators from each group have a long standing history of performing outstanding ARDS and critical care research, and conducting multi-center clinical trials. The overarching aims of the Colorado Clinical Center for the PETAL network will be: 1) To be an effective clinical center that achieves seamless coordination of care between Critical Care and Emergency Medicine and continues to exceed our contractual obligations to enroll patients; 2) To actively participate in the selection of the clinical trials to be performed by the PETAL network and to contribute to the subsequent responsibilities of the steering and other PETAL committees; 3) To improve the conduct of clinical trials by facilitating the Institutional Review Board process; 4) To maintain excellence and disseminate methodology to improve the quality of protocol compliance, data acquisition, and regulatory responsibilities across the PETAL network.","9565606; 8209180 (contact); ","GINDE, ADIT A.; MOSS, MARC  (contact);","REINECK, LORA A.","06/17/2014","04/30/2021","Accident and Emergency department; Acute; Acute Lung Injury; Address; Admission activity; Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome; Affect; Alaska Native; Ally; American Indians; Area; base; Bilateral; Caring; Case Series; Chest; Clinical; clinical care; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials; Collaborations; Colorado; Conduct Clinical Trials; Consent; Country; Critical Care; Critical Illness; Data; data acquisition; Development; Early treatment; Emergency department visit; Emergency Medicine; Enrollment; experience; Extramural Activities; Fostering; Funding; Goals; Growth; Health; Hispanics; Hospitals; Hypoxemia; improved; improved outcome; Individual; Injury; innovation; Institutional Review Boards; Intensive Care Units; Intervention; Lead; Liquid substance; Lung; Manuscripts; Mechanics; Medical; Medical center; medical specialties; Medicine; meetings; member; Methodology; Methods; metropolitan; Mosses; Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; Operative Surgical Procedures; Outcome; Patient Care; patient oriented research; Patients; Pneumonia; Positioning Attribute; prevent; Prevention; Principal Investigator; Process; Protocol Compliance; Protocols documentation; public health relevance; Publications; Publishing; Pulmonary Embolism; Recording of previous events; Research; Research Infrastructure; Research Personnel; Research Project Grants; research study; Residencies; Resources; Risk; Rosa; Sampling; Science; screening; Seminal; Sepsis; Site; Symptoms; Syndrome; Testing; Time; Training Programs; Transfusion; United States; Universities; Work; ","Colorado PETAL Clinical Center","123010","ZHL1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","04","267129","106727","373856",""

Currently there are no accurate molecular biomarkers that may help risk-stratify patients at the time of diagnosis, and therefore a vast majority of patients are forced to receive up to 6 months of Azacytidine before they can be offered alternative therapies. Moreover, it is unclear why some patients respond while others don't.

In addition to the well-studied causes of diabetes and hypertension, many cases of CKD occur in their absence, especially in subjects with metabolic syndrome or aging. Based on preliminary data, we hypothesize that nondiabetic CKD and aging-associated kidney disease are largely caused by western diets rich in simple sugars that engage the polyol-fructokinase pathway in the kidney. In this proposal we will study the effect of diet rich in simple sugars or complex carbohydrates on normal mice, mice with metabolic syndrome, mice with preexistent CKD, and aging mice to determine the role of diet in causing or accelerating their kidney disease and the role of fructokinase in this process. Our work should identify a novel role for carbohydrates and sugar in driving CKD and novel ways to prevent CKD.

Although severe memory impairment in isolation is rare, the study of such impairment in amnesia provides a window onto the consequences of memory deficits in more prevalent disorders in which multiple cognitive abilities, including memory, are implicated. Memory problems have long been recognized as a major cognitive impediment in their own right. Recent evidence that memory problems may also contribute to impairments in future-oriented thought and behavior suggests that the impact of memory impairment may extend well beyond what was appreciated previously. Future-oriented behaviors are necessary for optimal health decisions, successful functional integration, and general wellbeing.

This excision occurs within spliceosomes and requires precise recognition ? during both spliceosome assembly and splicing catalysis ? of three sites (two splice sites and a branch site) to appropriately join exonic coding sequences. Mechanisms by which spliceosomes recognize the exact sites and catalyze the reactions are not well understood. Mutations in components of the U2 snRNP are implicated in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and mutations that alter snRNP levels underlie spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Our studies will provide a better understanding of U2 snRNPs and their interactions with the RNA ligands that are substrates for catalysis.","1931229; ","QUERY, CHARLES C;","BENDER, MICHAEL T.","08/01/1999","02/28/2021","3' Splice Site; Address; ATP phosphohydrolase; Base Pairing; Binding; Binding Sites; Bioinformatics; Biological Models; Biology; Catalysis; Cell Nucleus; cell type; Cells; Chemicals; ChIP-seq; Chromatin; Code; Data; Data Set; density; Development; differential expression; DNA Polymerase II; Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes; Engineering; Event; Excision; Exons; experimental study; Fission Yeast; Gene Expression; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Transcription; genetic variant; global run on sequencing; Goals; Growth; Hematopoiesis; Human; Introns; Investigation; Joining Exons; Knowledge; Ligands; Link; Malignant Neoplasms; Mammalian Cell; mammalian genome; Maps; Minor; Modification; mRNA Precursor; Mutation; novel; Nucleotides; Pathway interactions; Polyadenylation; Positioning Attribute; Primer Extension; Process; programs; Proteins; Pseudouridine; public health relevance; Publishing; Reaction; Repetitive Sequence; RNA; RNA Splicing; Role; Site; Small Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins; Small Nuclear RNA; Spinal Muscular Atrophy; Spliceosome Assembly Pathway; Spliceosomes; stem; Structure; Testing; transcription factor; transcriptome sequencing; Trinucleotide Repeats; U2 Small Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein; U2 small nuclear RNA; U6 small nuclear RNA; Variant; Vertebrates; Yeasts; ","Protein RNA Rearrangements in the Spliceosome","057829","MGA","Molecular Genetics A Study Section ","","A1","19","320372","214649","535021",""

While modern medical advances have reduced MG mortality rates over the last several decades, there has been an increase in reported cases especially among the aging population. The number of diagnosed MG cases is expected to rise as the aging population increases and screening techniques for MG improve. From a public health perspective, it is clear that increased understanding of the etiology underlying MG is critical for enhancing diagnosis and treatment of this disease. To better translate basic research discoveries into the standard treatment regimen of MG patients, the New York Academy of Sciences, in partnership with the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America, will organize the 13th International Conference on Myasthenia Gravis and Related Disorders. The conference will provide a neutral forum for approximately 300 basic scientists and clinical researcers to discuss, disseminate, and highlight the advances and challenges of therapies for myasthenia gravis. Open-access publication of the conference proceedings in the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences as well as an open-access live simulcast broadcast of the meeting proceedings are planned to disseminate the scientific information exchanged at the meeting to the global research and medical communities.","11937959; 9581352; 8825405 (contact); ","BRICKMAN STYNES, MELANIE ; BURNS, TED M.; KUSNER, LINDA LOUISE (contact);","NUCKOLLS, GLEN H.","05/15/2017","05/14/2018","abstracting; Academia; Academy; Address; Advocate; aging population; Americas; Animal Model; Area; Autoimmune Diseases; Autoimmune Process; Autoimmunity; Award; Basic Science; career; Caring; Case Study; Child; Chronic Disease; Clinic; Clinical; clinical care; clinical development; Clinical Investigator; Clinical Trials; Collaborations; Communication; Communities; Congresses; data exchange; Development; Diagnosis; disability; Disabled Persons; discount; Disease; Educational workshop; Emerging Technologies; Etiology; Event; Faculty; Family; Fatigue; Fellowship; Female; Fostering; Foundations; Future; Genomics; Goals; Government; Guidelines; Health; Immunotherapy; improved; Industry; innovation; International; Internet; Knowledge; Life; Life Expectancy; Medical; Medical Research; meetings; Mentors; Minority; minority investigator; Mission; mortality; multidisciplinary; Muscle Weakness; Myasthenia; Myasthenia Gravis; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke; nervous system disorder; Neurobiology; Neurologic; neuromuscular; Neuromuscular Diseases; Neuromuscular Junction; New York; New York City; Nicotinic Receptors; Oral; Participant; Pathogenesis; Patient-Focused Outcomes; Patients; Pharmacologic Substance; Phenotype; Physicians; Physiological; posters; Prize; Process; programs; Public Health; Publications; Publishing; Quality of life; racial minority; receptor structure function; repository; Research; research and development; Research Personnel; response; Science; Scientist; screening; Serological; standard care; Structure; symposium; Syndrome; Techniques; Technology; Therapeutic; Translating; Translations; Travel; Treatment Protocols; treatment response; Underrepresented Minority; Update; Woman; ","13th International Conference on Myasthenia Gravis and Related Disorders","101926","ZNS1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","15000","0","15000",""

Ca2+ in turn is a potent regulator of neuronal functions including neuronal excitability and gene expression. We recently discovered that the structural protein ?-actinin is the main docking protein that anchors Cav1.2 at defined subcellular regions and especially at postsynaptic sites where neurons receive input from other neurons. Excessive Ca2+ influx via Cav1.2 has been implicated in brain diseases such as Alzheimer?s disease (AD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and autism. Prolonged Ca2+ influx leads to displacement of  ?-actinin and triggers removal of Cav1.2 from the cell surface. This mechanism curbs influx of Ca2+ into neurons to prevent toxic effects by excessive Ca2+ influx. We have evidence that this mechanism is dysfunct in AD. The excessive Ca2+ influx than can cause neuronal damage leading to loss of neurons. We will define the precise functional interplay between Cav1.2 and ?-actinin to better understand surface targeting of Cav1.2 in health anddiseases including AD and PTSD.","1958738; ","HELL, JOHANNES W;","WISE, BRADLEY C.","08/15/2016","04/30/2021","abstracting; Actinin; Action Potentials; Affect; alpha Actinin; Alzheimer's Disease; autism spectrum disorder; Autistic Disorder; Back; Behavior; Binding; Biotinylation; Brain; Brain Diseases; Calcium-Activated Potassium Channel; Calmodulin; Cell Density; Cell surface; Cells; Cellular biology; Charge; Cognitive; Coupled; Coupling; CREB1 gene; Data; Degradation Pathway; Dendritic Spines; density; Docking; Electrophysiology (science); Endocytosis; Endosomes; Excision; experimental study; Fingers; Fostering; Functional disorder; Future; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetic Transcription; Glutamate Receptor; glycosylation; Goals; Golgi Apparatus; Grant; Health; Heart; Hippocampus (Brain); Hypoglycemia; Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes; insight; interest; Internet; Ions; Kinetics; knock-down; Knock-in Mouse; Label; Learning; Lobe; Measures; Mediating; Memory; Molecular; Monitor; Mus; mutant; Mutate; Mutation; neuron loss; neuronal excitability; Neurons; Nuclear Translocation; Paper; patch clamp; Pathway interactions; Physiological; Play; Point Mutation; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders; postsynaptic; premature; prevent; Probability; Proteins; Recycling; Regulation; Rodent Model; Role; Running; Science; Senility; Signal Transduction; Site; Structural Protein; Surface; Symptoms; Synapses; synaptic function; Synaptic plasticity; System; Testing; Tetanus; Time; Timothy syndrome; Toes; Toxic effect; trafficking; transcription factor; transcription factor NF-AT c3; Vertebral column; Work; ","Role of a-actinin in Cav1.2 Function","055357","SYN","Synapses, Cytoskeleton and Trafficking Study Section ","","","02","287553","163905","451458",""

To this end our work has been carried out exclusively in cultured human brain cells (chiefly primary neuronal-astroglial co-cultures) that have been stressed with AD-relevant stressors [such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), IL-1?, TNF?, A?42 peptides and AD extracts], in short PMI AD and control tissues (anatomical regions targeted by AD) and in transgenic murine amyloid over-expressing AD models with particular focus on the murine 5xFAD Tg-AD model; through the integrated analysis of over 160 early- and moderate-to-advanced sporadic AD brain samples, extensive human brain cell primary cultures and 5xFAD analysis we have identified a small up-regulated family of 6 inducible, NF-kB-regulated, miRNAs and have characterized the down-regulation of the expression of a 10-member messenger RNA (mRNA) group which is targeted by these up-regulated miRNAs. These miRNA-mRNA signaling data are the most extensive ever compiled for high quality short PMI sporadic AD brains; the data reveal a highly interactive, pathogenic gene regulatory signaling network which explains virtually all of the neuropathology of the AD brain that once begun, appears to be self- perpetuating due perhaps to chronic re-activation of NF-kB (p50/p65); inhibition of the NF-kB initiator(s) or individual blocking of the pathogenic induction of these 6 miRNAs using an anti-miRNA approach should re- establish brain cell homeostasis, provide novel therapeutic strategies and ultimately be of highly effective use in the clinical management of AD.","6251638; ","LUKIW, WALTER J;","OPANASHUK, LISA ANN","08/01/2011","04/30/2021","3' Untranslated Regions; Age; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's disease model; Amyloid; amyloidogenesis; Area; base; Bioinformatics; Boxing; Brain; brain cell; Brain Diseases; Brain region; Brain Stem; Cell Line; Cells; Characteristics; Chronic; Clinical Management; Coculture Techniques; cytokine; Data; disorder control; DNA; Dot Immunoblotting; Down Syndrome; Down-Regulation; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Epigenetic Process; Factor Analysis; Family; gamma-Glutamyl Hydrolase; Gel; Gene Chips; Gene Expression; Goals; Hippocampus (Brain); Homeostasis; Human; Impairment; In Vitro; in vivo; indexing; Individual; Inflammation; Inflammatory; inhibitor/antagonist; Interleukin-1 beta; internal control; Maps; member; Messenger RNA; Microglia; MicroRNAs; mind control; Molecular Genetics; mouse model; Mus; Natural Immunity; Neocortex; neuroinflammation; Neurons; neuropathology; NF-kappa B; novel; novel therapeutic intervention; novel therapeutics; overexpression; p65; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Peptides; Phagocytosis; Physiological; Process; Proteins; Reactive Oxygen Species; receptor; Regulator Genes; Research; Sampling; Signal Transduction; Staging; Stress; stressor; synaptogenesis; System; tau Proteins; Thalamic structure; Therapeutic; Tissues; TNF gene; TNFRSF5 gene; Transgenic Mice; Transgenic Model; transgenic model of alzheimer disease; Transgenic Organisms; TREM2 gene; Ubiquitin; Ubiquitination; Up-Regulation; Work; ","microRNA (miRNA) signaling in Alzheimer's disease(AD)","038834","CNBT","Clinical Neuroimmunology and Brain Tumors Study Section ","","","07","225000","103500","328500",""

By combining dMRI, MRS, and EEG measures in the same patients, we hope to understand better the underpinnings of white matter pathology in schizophrenia. This knowledge will, in turn, provide a new perspective for treatment intervention that would involve possible anti-inflammatory medications.","1893384; ","SHENTON, MARTHA E.;","","04/01/2009","09/30/2019","Acute; Affect; Anti-inflammatory; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Antipsychotic Agents; Attention; Award; axon injury; axonal degeneration; base; Biological; Brain; cellular pathology; Choline; Chronic; Chronic Schizophrenia; Clinical; Cognitive; Communication; Data; Demyelinations; Development; Diffusion; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Disease; Disease remission; early onset; Edema; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology (science); Etiology; excitotoxicity; extracellular; follow-up; Funding; General Population; Glutamates; Glutathione; Goals; Grant; gray matter; Healthcare; improved; in vivo; Inflammation; inflammatory marker; interhemispheric transfer; Intervention; Investigation; Knowledge; Lead; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; magnetic resonance imaging biomarker; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Measures; Methods; Mission; Myelin; myelin degeneration; myoinositol; N-acetylaspartate; Nature; Nerve Degeneration; Neurobiology; neurochemistry; neuroimaging marker; neuroinflammation; Neurons; neurotransmission; Neurotransmitters; novel; Onset of illness; Outcome; Pathologic Processes; Pathology; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacological Treatment; Phenotype; Population; Process; Progress Reports; Proliferation Marker; Protons; Psychotic Disorders; psychotic symptoms; public health relevance; Publications; Publishing; Reporting; Resources; Role; Schizophrenia; Specificity; Spectrum Analysis; Speed; Staging; Symptoms; Synapses; Syndrome; Time; Tissues; tool; transmission process; treatment strategy; Water; white matter; white matter change; Work; ","MR Brain Diffusion Tensor Imaging in Schizophrenia","000176","MHBA","Mental Health and Behavioral Science A ","","","07","","","",""

Since VHA is a continuing system of care, we are confronted with long-term complications of diabetes. Gastrointestinal complications are common, cause significant morbidity and seriously confound the management of diabetes.

These disorders are reemerging due to emerging resistance to anti-fungal agents, a lack of new drug development and the prevalence of immunosuppressive conditions due to HIV/AIDS and medical conditions such as cancer and organ transplantation.","6522585; ","HISE, AMY G;","","10/01/2014","09/30/2018","adaptive immune response; adaptive immunity; Adult; AIDS/HIV problem; Antifungal Agents; antimicrobial peptide; Binding; Biological Assay; cancer transplantation; Candida; Candida albicans; Candidiasis; CASP1 gene; Cell physiology; Cell Wall; Cells; Chitin; cytokine; Data; dectin 1; Denture Stomatitis; Dependence; design; Development; Disease; Disseminated candidiasis; drug development; Drug resistance; Epithelial; Flow Cytometry; Fungal Drug Resistance; Generations; Glucans; Goals; Health; Hospitals; Host Defense; Human; Hyphae; Immune; Immune response; Immunity; Immunosuppressive Agents; Individual; Infection; Inflammatory; Inflammatory Response; Innate Immune Response; Interleukin-1; Knock-out; Knockout Mice; Laboratories; Life; lymph nodes; Mannans; Mediating; Medical; Modeling; Molecular; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; mouse model; Mucosal Immune Responses; mucosal site; Mucous Membrane; Mus; Mycoses; Natural immunosuppression; Nosocomial Infections; novel; novel therapeutics; Oral candidiasis; Oral cavity; oral infection; Oral mucous membrane structure; Organ Transplantation; oropharyngeal thrush; Outcome; pathogen; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pattern recognition receptor; Play; Predisposition; Prevalence; prevent; Process; protein complex; Proteins; reconstitution; Research; response; Role; Sepsis; Severity of illness; Signal Transduction; small hairpin RNA; Stimulus; Systemic infection; T cell response; T-Lymphocyte; Therapeutic Agents; Tissues; TLR2 gene; United States; Veterans; Yeasts; ","Role of inflammasomes in mucosal and systemic candidiasis.","002607","INFB","Infectious Diseases B ","","","03","","","",""

Obesity, hypertension and diabetes are major risk factors for developing CKD. CKD patients suffer from premature death because of cardiovascular disease. Obesity affects more than one-third of the US population, 35.5% of the VA population and about 50% of the CKD population. In this proposal, we focus on the consequences of the coexistence of obesity and CKD and their relative and combined contribution to the development of insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease in people with CKD. The first part of this proposal will study obesity-related hormones that accumulate when your kidneys are not working and what they can tell us about the metabolic problems seen in these circumstances including insulin resistance. The second part of the proposal wills study if certain medications that are known to improve metabolic disease in obese patients with normal kidney function will reverse these metabolic derangements in CKD, and reduce cardiovascular disease and death.","8604104; ","HUNG, ADRIANA ;","","10/01/2014","09/30/2018","adipokines; adiponectin; Adipose tissue; Affect; Anti-inflammatory; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Antiatherogenic; Atherosclerosis; Blood Vessels; burden of illness; Cardiovascular Diseases; Caring; Cessation of life; Chronic; Chronic Kidney Failure; Clinical; clinical practice; Data; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; Elements; End stage renal failure; Endocrine Glands; endothelial dysfunction; Epidemic; Euglycemic Clamping; Event; Fatty acid glycerol esters; Functional disorder; General Population; Generations; Glucose Clamp; glucose disposal; Gold; Growth; Health; health administration; Healthcare Systems; High Prevalence; high risk; Hormones; Hyperinsulinism; Hypertension; improved; improved outcome; indexing; Inflammation; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Intervention; Kidney; kidney vascular structure; Knowledge; Lead; Leptin; Measures; Medicare; Metabolic; Metabolic acidosis; Metabolic Diseases; Metabolic Marker; Metabolic syndrome; Metformin; Mission; moderate obesity; Monitor; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Names; Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; novel marker; Obesity; Output; Oxidative Stress; Pathogenesis; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Placebos; Play; Population; premature; Prevalence; prevent; primary outcome; Production; profiles in patients; Public Health; Renal function; Research; Risk; Risk Factors; Role; Testing; Time; tool; Veterans; Work; ","Dysmetabolism of Chronic Kidney Disease and Vascular Health","000982","ENDA","Endocriniology A ","","","03","","","",""

While the gold standard for the treatment o severe PAD remains bypass grafting with autologous vein, vein is often not available, necessitating the use of prosthetic grafts which are associated with very high failure rates. Showing the impact on veterans, in 1998, the VA provided 4,822 hospitalizations for peripheral vascular procedures, and unfortunately 5,329 hospitalizations for limb amputation.

A population of stem cells known as 'fibroadipogenic progenitors', or 'FAPs', exists within skeletal muscle, and it has been suggested that these cells may be responsible for some or even most of the degenerative changes that occur when muscle regeneration is impaired. The goal of our studies is to understand what mechanisms control the fate and function of these FAPS and to determine the extent to which we can modulate the behavior of these cells in order to reduce the amount of fibrosis that develops in muscle, whether in injury, degenerative diseases, or aging.

C. difficile infection (CDI) can result in a spectrum of diseases that range from mild diarrhea to pseudomembranous colitis and can include life- threatening complications such as perforation of the colon, toxic megacolon, and sepsis. Problems with current treatment strategies include issues with relapse, recurrence, and instances where antibiotics fail to alter the disease process (no response). CDI pathology is associated with the action of two toxins, TcdA and TcdB. The toxins and the pathways they use to cause disease, therefore, represent attractive targets for the development of novel therapeutics that can be used either to prevent relapse and recurrence or to prevent the life-threatening aspects of existing infections.","8736461; ","LACY, DANA BORDEN;","","10/01/2015","09/30/2019","Acetylcysteine; Actins; Antibiotics; Antioxidants; Apigenin; base; Binding; Categories; Cell model; Cells; Chemical Structure; clinical practice; Clinical Treatment; Clostridium difficile; Collection; Colon; Complex; Cytoskeleton; cytotoxicity; Cytotoxin; Data; design; Development; Diarrhea; Dihydropyridines; Disease; Disease Outbreaks; Dissection; Drug Design; ebselen; efficacy testing; Enzymes; Epidemic; Epithelial Cells; Evaluation; Event; experimental study; Family; FDA approved; Foundations; Glucosyltransferase; Glucosyltransferases; Goals; Guanosine Triphosphate Phosphohydrolases; high throughput screening; Human; hypertension treatment; in vivo; Individual; Infection; Inflammation; inhibitor/antagonist; Intoxication; Knockout Mice; Lead; Life; Link; Mediating; Military Personnel; Modeling; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; mouse model; Mus; Mutation; NADPH Oxidase; Necrosis; Nifedipine; novel; novel therapeutics; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Perforation; Phloretin; pre-clinical; prevent; Prevention; Process; Production; Property; protective efficacy; Pseudomembranous Colitis; public health relevance; Reactive Oxygen Species; Recurrence; Relapse; Reproduction spores; research clinical testing; response; rho; Roentgen Rays; Sepsis; small molecule; small molecule inhibitor; Source; Structure; systemic toxicity; Therapeutic; tissue culture; Tissues; Toxic Megacolon; Toxin; Translating; Treatment outcome; treatment strategy; United States; Universities; Variant; Veterans; Virulence Factors; ","Pre-clinical evaluation of Clostridium difficile toxin inhibitors","002943","INFB","Infectious Diseases B ","","","02","","","",""

Depending on the geographical location, a large subset of people with HAND are illicit substance users. The current antiretroviral treatments, while able to prevent or control AIDS, are largely ineffective against most forms of HAND. There is an urgent need to better understand the biology of this disease, the contribution of illicit substance use to it, andto identify interventions to prevent or treat HAND. Using an HIV designed to infect mice and finding that this infection causes early and persistent neurocognitive disease in infected animals (called mouse HAND) that resembles mild HAND in humans, this program proposes and tests specific biochemical routes through which an HIV-infected individual has learning or memory problems and how morphine or heroin might further exacerbate these problems. The majority of experimental studies will be done in mice either in tests of behavior/learning or in brain tissue analysis to investigate the biochemical mediators proposed in this program to act in cognition and learning. As key mediators are identified in mice, their levels and expression will be examined in archived brain tissues from patients (stratified by illicit substance use) who died with HAND, to determine relevance of these findings to human disease. Finally, based on the results obtained, as important checkpoints of mild HAND are characterized over the course of this program, specific intervention strategies, some using existing pharmaceuticals, will be tried in infected mice to prevent or ameliorate HIV brain disease. We hope these studies will increase our knowledge base on HAND pathogenesis, including in people regularly using illicit substances, and provide guidance for developing treatments in infected people.","1871302; ","VOLSKY, DAVID J;","POLLOCK, JONATHAN D","04/01/2014","03/31/2019","Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; adaptive immune response; Alcohol or Other Drugs use; Animal Model; Animals; Anti-Retroviral Agents; antiretroviral therapy; Antiviral Agents; antiviral immunity; Archives; base; behavior test; Benign; Biochemical; Bioinformatics; Biology; biomarker panel; Brain; Brain Diseases; Brain Injuries; Brain Pathology; brain tissue; calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II; Cells; ChIP-seq; chromatin immunoprecipitation; chromatin remodeling; Chronic; Clinical; Cognition; Cognition Disorders; Data; Dementia; design; Diagnosis; Disease; Disease Marker; Dose; efficacy testing; Epigenetic Process; experimental study; Frequencies; Functional disorder; Gene Silencing; Genes; Genetic Transcription; Geographic Locations; Goals; Heroin; histone modification; Histones; HIV; HIV Infections; HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder; Human; human disease; Immune; immune function; Immunity; Immunocompetent; Immunology; Impaired cognition; implantation; Individual; Infection; inhibitor/antagonist; Injury; innovation; Intervention; Knock-out; Knockout Mice; knowledge base; learned behavior; Learning; Link; Lysine; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; Memory; Methylation; Modeling; Molecular; Morphine; Mus; Mutant Strains Mice; Natural History; Neurocognitive; Neurocognitive Deficit; Neuropathogenesis; neuropathology; novel; Opiate Addiction; Opiates; Opioid Receptor; Pathogenesis; patient stratification; Performance; Pharmacologic Substance; Physiological; Placebos; Potassium Hydroxide; pre-clinical; prevent; Process; programs; promoter; public health relevance; Recovery; Refractory; Research; Role; Route; seroconversion; Site; Specificity; Substance abuse problem; success; Symptoms; Synapses; synaptic function; Synaptic plasticity; System; Systemic infection; Systems Biology; targeted treatment; Testing; Time; Tissue Banks; Tissues; treatment strategy; Variant; Viral reservoir; viral transmission; Virus; ","Threshold of Cognitive Impairment after HIV Infection: Effect of Morphine","037611","ZDA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","04","420448","292211","712659",""

The lungs are normally protected from pneumonia by white blood cells called alveolar macrophages. In the lungs of COPD patients, especially those with emphysema, cells die in larger numbers than in healthy lungs. Eating those dead cells ('efferocytosis') lessens the ability of alveolar macro- phages to fight infection. This laboratory found that the combination of dead cells plus corticosteroids greatly reduces the ability of alveolar macrophages to kill the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia. Reduced alveolar macrophage function appears to be caused by decreases in specific molecules, called microRNAs. This project uses mice and alveolar macrophages from human volunteers to develop a new treatment that would reverse this particular harmful effects of inhaled corticosteroids, by replacing those specific microRNAs when COPD patients taking inhaled corticosteroids develop pneumonia.","1893520; ","CURTIS, JEFFREY LOUIS;","","10/01/2015","09/30/2019","Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Adverse effects; Alveolar; Alveolar Macrophages; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Antibacterial Response; Apoptosis; Apoptotic; Bacteria; bactericide; Bacteriophages; base; Biological Assay; Breathing; case-based; Cause of Death; Cell Count; Cell physiology; Cells; Cessation of life; chemokine; Chronic Disease; Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease; cigarette smoke; Clinical; clinically relevant; Communities; cytokine; Data; Defect; Dose; Down-Regulation; Eating; fighting; fluticasone; Gene Expression; Gene Targeting; Genes; Global Change; Glucocorticoids; Goals; Heating; Histology; Host Defense; Human; Human Volunteers; Immune; immune function; Immune response; improved outcome; In Vitro; in vivo; Infection; Inflammation Mediators; Inflammatory; Investigation; Killings; Laboratories; Lead; Leukocytes; Lung; macrophage; Mediator of activation protein; Messenger RNA; MicroRNAs; Molecular; Molecular Profiling; monocyte; mouse model; Mus; Natural immunosuppression; neutrophil; never smoker; novel; Nucleotides; Organ; Organism; Outcome; overexpression; Patients; personalized medicine; Phenotype; Pneumococcal Infections; Pneumococcal Pneumonia; Pneumonia; Predisposition; Process; Production; Proteins; Protocols documentation; public health relevance; Pulmonary Emphysema; response; Risk; Severities; Signal Transduction; Smoke; Smoker; Smoking; Steroids; Stimulus; Streptococcus pneumoniae; Survival Analysis; Testing; transcriptome; Untranslated RNA; uptake; Veterans; Work; ","Modulation of Steroid Suppression by Alveolar Macrophage Efferocytosis","000911","PULM","Respiration ","","","02","","","",""

Although mucosal restitution is critical for maintaining epithelial integrity during criical surgical stress, the exact mechanism underlying this process remains unclear. Goal of this study is to define the cellular and molecular mechanism by which damaged mucosa is rapidly repaired by testing a novel hypothesis that a4, an important PP2A associated protein, plays a role in the regulation of gut mucosal restitution.

We predict this will reduce alcohol self-administration and relapse drinking or anxiety-like behavior in both male and female rats.

Stroke is the most common life-threatening neurological disorder and the third leading cause of death in the US. Blood vessel obstruction due to the pathological accumulation of blood platelets is the major etiological factor in these disorders. Current antithrombotic and neuroprotective therapeutic measures are useful, but require further improvement to decrease morbidity and mortality. CD39 is a cell surface enzyme that controls thrombosis by modulating excessive platelet reactivity. Because of its ability to control platelet reactivity and thereby maintain blood fluidity, CD39 should serve as a therapeutic modality for platelet-driven thrombotic disorders.

Changes in the expression of specific genes will be analyzed since these regulate the ability of breast cancers to escape from the primary tumor, leading to tumors that are largely untreatable. Both men and women veterans could benefit from studies that seek to understand how breast cancers become more aggressive. This is because some of the same risk factors that are associated with poor prognosis in the general population are also found in the VA population. Several new compounds that prevent or reverse this progression will be characterized and tested. The discovery of therapeutic strategies and specific agents that prevent or reverse breast cancer progression will increase our understanding of other diseases common in the VA population and will have a positive impact on the ability to treat breast cancer in the broader population.","2068643; ","PASSANITI, ANTONINO ;","","10/01/2013","09/30/2017","6p21; Address; aerobic glycolysis; African American; Age; Aging; Appearance; Biological Assay; bone; Breast Cancer Cell; Breast Cancer Patient; Breast Epithelial Cells; cancer cell differentiation; Cancer Cell Growth; Cancer Death Rates; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cell Differentiation process; Cell model; Cell Proliferation; cell transformation; Cells; Cellular Metabolic Process; Cessation of life; Cholecalciferol; Chromosomes; Clinical; clinically relevant; Colorectal; Computer Assisted; Consumption; design; Development; Diagnosis; Differentiation and Growth; Disease; DNA; DNA Binding; Drug Design; Early Diagnosis; effective therapy; Elderly; Electron Transport; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Epithelial; Estrogen Receptors; Exhibits; Female Breast Carcinoma; Funding; Gene Expression; General Population; Genes; glucose metabolism; Glycolysis; Goals; Growth; Head and Neck Cancer; Health; Healthcare; Healthcare Systems; Hormones; in vivo; insight; Laboratories; Lactate Dehydrogenase; Lipids; Lung; male; malignant breast neoplasm; Malignant neoplasm of male breast; Malignant Neoplasms; Measures; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; melanoma; men; Mesenchymal; Metabolic; Metabolic Pathway; Metabolism; Metastatic breast cancer; Methods; Mission; Mitochondria; Molecular; Molecular Weight; Morbidity - disease rate; Morphology; mortality; Mortality Decline; Neoplasm Metastasis; neoplastic cell; new therapeutic target; Normal Cell; novel; novel therapeutics; Nutritional; Oncogenes; Oncogenic; osteosarcoma; outcome forecast; overexpression; Oxidative Phosphorylation; Oxidoreductase; Oxygen; Oxygen Consumption; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Patient Care; Patients; Phenotype; Phosphorylation; Population; Preclinical Drug Evaluation; prevent; Primary Neoplasm; Private Sector; prohormone; Proliferating; Proteins; Pyruvate; Pyruvate Metabolism Pathway; Receptor Cell; Regulation; Respiration; Risk Factors; Site; Smoker; Smoking; Subgroup; Suppressor Genes; System; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Intervention; therapeutic target; Thyroid Gland; Time; transcription factor; Transcriptional Regulation; tumor; tumor growth; tumor metabolism; tumor progression; United States; United States Department of Veterans Affairs; Variant; Vascular Diseases; Veterans; Vitamin D; Warburg Effect; Woman; ","Transcriptional regulation of tumor growth","002205","ONCA","Oncology A ","","","04","","","",""

In studies of VA patients in ambulatory clinic, over 75% were overweight or obese.

Currently, there are no inhibitors for DNase I or other therapies based on inactivation of similar enzymes. Therefore, we propose several new methods to inactivate DNase I for kidney protection in mice using the native mechanism as well as new chemical inhibitors of DNase I.

There is a critical need to understand the mechanisms underlying this injury to facilitate rational drug design. In addition, biomarkers are needed to identify those individuals at risk so that potential treatments can be tested before damage to the brain is advanced. The aging veteran population and high rate of head injury will lead to daunting costs and responsibilities for the VA if research aimed at translating mechanisms into biomarkers and treatments is not developed.","10876888; ","STEIN, THOR ;","","10/01/2014","09/30/2018","Address; Affect; Aging; Alleles; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's disease risk; Apolipoprotein E; apolipoprotein E-4; Area; Autopsy; axon injury; base; Behavioral; Biochemical; Biochemical Genetics; Biological Markers; Blast Injuries; Brain; Brain region; chronic traumatic encephalopathy; Clinical; clinical biomarkers; cohort; cost; Craniocerebral Trauma; Data; Deposition; Development; Diagnosis; Disease; disease diagnosis; Disease Progression; DNA; Drug Design; drug discovery; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Executive Dysfunction; experience; Gene Expression; Gene Proteins; Genes; genetic risk factor; genomic variation; Genotype; Goals; Haplotypes; Health; Human; Individual; Injury; Lead; Life; Long-Term Effects; MAPT gene; Measurement; Measures; Mechanical Stress; Memory Loss; Metabolism; mild traumatic brain injury; Molecular; Monitor; Motor Neuron Disease; motor symptom; Nerve Degeneration; Neurobehavioral Manifestations; Neurodegenerative Disorders; neurofilament; Neuroglia; Neurons; neuropathology; novel marker; Pathology; Patients; Pattern; Personality; Phosphorylation; Play; Population; Predisposition; progressive neurodegeneration; protein expression; Protein Isoforms; protein TDP-43; Proteins; Recording of previous events; Recruitment Activity; Research; Research Project Grants; Risk; Risk Factors; risk variant; RNA; Role; Severities; Severity of illness; Soldier; tau Proteins; tau-1; Tauopathies; Testing; Tissue Microarray; Translating; translational approach; Trauma; Variant; Veterans; Work; ","The neuropathology of mild traumatic brain injury in Alzheimer's disease","001038","NURD","Neurobiology D ","","","03","","","",""

Every year, >7,000 Veterans suffer new strokes, and there are >80,000 surviving Veterans with stroke-induced neurological dysfunction. The costs are ~$500 million yearly (~$200 million for acute inpatient care, ~$100 million for follow-up care in the first 6 months, and ~$200 for the long-term rehabilitation). The negative impact of this devastating disease on Veterans will increase enormously unless the mechanisms of post-stroke brain damage are deciphered and new therapies are developed. An avenue for studying this damage is offered by neurodegenation that many Veterans show in later life. A protein, a-Synuclein, is a proponent of neurodegeneration, and interestingly, we found that this protein is also induced after stroke. Hence, we wish to test if a-Synuclein can be targeted to curtail post-stroke brain damage that might also help to minimize the motor dysfunction. The overall goal of this project is to test if a-Synuclein can be used to develop nove therapies to help the recovery of aged Veterans who suffer stroke.","6079094; ","VEMUGANTI, RAGHU ;","","10/01/2015","09/30/2019","Acute; Adult; aged; Aging; alpha synuclein; Apoptosis; Autophagocytosis; base; Brain; Brain Injuries; C-terminal; Caring; Cause of Death; Cerebral Ischemia; Chronic; cost; Data; design; disability; Disease; Down-Regulation; Elderly; follow-up; Future; Goals; Health; Hour; Infarction; Inflammation; Inpatients; Ischemia; Ischemic Brain Injury; knock-down; Knockout Mice; long-term rehabilitation; Longitudinal Studies; Lysine; Lysosomes; Mediating; Messenger RNA; MicroRNAs; Mission; Mitochondria; Modification; Molecular; monomer; motor disorder; Mus; N-terminal; Nerve Degeneration; Neurodegenerative Disorders; Neurologic; Neurologic Dysfunctions; neuron loss; Neurons; neuroprotection; novel therapeutics; Outcome; Oxidative Stress; Parkinson Disease; Patient Care; Phosphorylation; Play; post stroke; Post-Translational Protein Processing; presynaptic; protein expression; Proteins; public health relevance; Rattus; Recovery; Repression; Research; Resources; Rodent; Role; Secondary to; Serine; Small Interfering RNA; stroke; Testing; therapy development; Toxic effect; Transgenic Mice; Translations; Ubiquitination; Veterans; Work; ","Role of alpha Synuclein and microRNA 7a in post stroke brain damage","002985","NURC","Neurobiology C ","","","02","","","",""

Many Veterans suffer from neuropathic pain associated with peripheral nerve injury after extensive limb trauma and in disease states in which peripheral nerves are damaged, including diabetes, herniated disc, and infections, as well as surgeries such as thoracotomy and amputation. Neuropathic pain is particularly distressing due to its intensity and stabbing sensation and its ability to enhance pain that is normally inocuous. Current treatments for neuropathic pain are inadequate, inconsistent and largely ineffective and therefore there is an urgent need for more effective treatment. New therapies will have to take advantage of anatomic and/or molecular specificity of analgesic pathways.

Cardiac muscle cell death plays a central role in causing cardiomyopathy, or impaired contractile function of the heart muscle; which is observed in more than half of all patients with heart failure. Autophagy is an intracellular process that breaks dow damaged cellular constituents, and is critical for cell survival. In this proposal, we will evaluat whether activation of autophagy can prevent cardiac muscle cell death in ischemia-reperfusion injury which causes ischemic heart disease; and prevent cardiomyopathy caused by aggregates of a mutant protein, B-crystallin; to develop new strategies to prevent and treat heart failure.","9572573; ","DIWAN, ABHINAV ;","","10/01/2013","09/30/2017","Ablation; Adult; age group; aging population; Anterior; Area; Arteries; artery occlusion; Attenuated; attenuation; Autophagocytosis; Autophagosome; Binding; Biogenesis; Cardiac; Cardiac Myocytes; Cardiomyopathies; Cell Death; Cell Nucleus; Cell Survival; Cessation of life; Chest; Crystallins; Cytoplasm; Data; Degradation Pathway; Desmin; Development; Disease; Doxycycline; Echocardiography; Energy-Generating Resources; Ensure; Excision; Fasting; feeding; Female; Food; Generations; Health; Heart; Heart failure; heart function; Hour; Human; Hypoxia; Impairment; In Vitro; in vivo; Incidence; Infarction; Ischemia; knock-down; Knockout Mice; Left; Left Ventricular Remodeling; Ligation; Lysosomes; Maintenance; male; Mediating; Membrane; Mitochondria; Modeling; Molecular Chaperones; mortality; Mus; mutant; Mutation; Myocardial; Myocardial Ischemia; Myocardial Reperfusion; Myocardium; Nuclear Translocation; Nutrient; Organelles; overexpression; Pathway interactions; Patients; Perinatal; Play; Population Group; pressure; Prevalence; prevent; Procedures; Process; protein aggregate; protein B; Proteins; proteotoxicity; Randomized; Reactive Oxygen Species; Reperfusion Injury; Reperfusion Therapy; Reporter; Risk; Role; sex; Starvation; Stimulus; Stress; Structure; Testing; transcription factor; Transgenes; Transgenic Mice; Transgenic Organisms; Up-Regulation; Ventricular; Veterans; Wild Type Mouse; Withdrawal; ","Enhancing Beneficial Autophagy to Prevent Heart Failure","001969","CARA","Cardiovascular Studies A ","","","04","","","",""

Certain lymphomas are increasing in the elderly, and as the population of veterans ages, this becomes an increasingly important medical problem. Prognosis is also poorer among the elderly. In addition, patients who receive organ transplants are particularly susceptible to cancers associated with EBV and KSHV.

The lack of effective treatments represents a significant gap in the ability to treat these devastating neurodegenerative diseases, and therefore the study of the role of glia maturation factor in the activation of glia-mast cell-neuron axis and secretion of proinflammatory mediators that are responsible for neurodegeneration may provide the scientific rationale for the development of novel therapy for these devastating illnesses.","7593901; ","ZAHEER, ASGAR ;","","10/01/2014","09/30/2018","1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine; 1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium; acquired immunity; Acute; Adenoviruses; Affect; Allergic Reaction; Alzheimer's Disease; American; Animal Model; Antioxidants; base; Behavioral; Bone Marrow; Bradykinesia; Brain; brain cell; Cell Communication; Cell secretion; Cells; chemokine; Chronic; Clinical; Coculture Techniques; combat; cytokine; design; Development; Direct Costs; Disease; dopaminergic neuron; effective therapy; Etiology; experimental study; Exposure to; Facilities and Administrative Costs; Free Radicals; Functional disorder; Glia Maturation Factor; glial activation; glutathione peroxidase; Glutathione Reductase; Goals; Health; Healthcare; Human; Human Pathology; In Vitro; in vivo; Infiltration; Inflammatory; Inflammatory Response; Ions; Iowa; Janus kinase; Laboratories; Lewy Bodies; Life; Lipid Peroxidation; MAP Kinase Gene; MAPK14 gene; mast cell; Measures; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; mouse model; Movement Disorders; Mus; Natural Immunity; Nerve Degeneration; Nerve Fibers; Neuraxis; neurochemistry; Neurodegenerative Disorders; Neuroglia; neuroinflammation; neuron loss; Neurons; neurotoxic; novel; novel therapeutic intervention; novel therapeutics; Operative Surgical Procedures; Oxidative Stress; Oxides; Parkinson Disease; Parkinsonian Disorders; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Patients; Permeability; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase; pollutant; Proteins; reconstitution; Reduced Glutathione; Research; Rest Tremor; Role; Signal Pathway; STAT protein; Symptoms; T-Lymphocyte; Testing; Therapeutic Agents; Therapeutic Intervention; Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances; Time; Toxic effect; Toxin; Umbilical Cord Blood; United States; Universities; Veterans; Wild Type Mouse; ","Glia maturation factor dependent mast cell activation in Parkinson's disease","002477","NURE","Neurobiology E ","","","04","","","",""

By elucidating exocyst structural information and mechanisms of action, therapeutic strategies can be devised to alleviate overactive exocyst or rescue exocyst defects resulting from mutations.","10995526; ","LEPORE, DANTE M;","SAKALIAN, MICHAEL ","03/12/2017","03/11/2020","Alleles; Antibodies; Architecture; base; Binding; Binding Sites; Biochemical; Biological Assay; C-terminal; cancer type; Cell Communication; Cells; Cellular Morphology; Cilia; ciliopathy; Complex; Cytosol; Defect; Destinations; Detection; Disease; Docking; Electron Microscopy; Ensure; Eukaryota; Event; Exocytosis; experimental study; Glass; Golgi Apparatus; Growth; In Vitro; Individual; insight; Joubert syndrome; Kinetics; Label; Link; Lipids; Maps; Measures; Mediating; Membrane; Membrane Fusion; Membrane Lipids; Membrane Protein Traffic; Membrane Proteins; Molecular Conformation; Mutation; Names; Negative Staining; neuron development; overexpression; Positioning Attribute; Protein Subunits; Proteins; Reaction; receptor; reconstitution; Recruitment Activity; Secretory Vesicles; Series; single molecule; Site; Slide; SNAP receptor; Specificity; Structure; Syndrome; System; Techniques; temperature sensitive mutant; Testing; Therapeutic; Time; Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent; trafficking; Vesicle; ","Elucidation of exocyst tethering function by single molecule assays and EM","123704","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","56334","","56334",""

Patients with newly diagnosed dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and reduced LV ejection fraction (LVEF) are initially managed using optimal medical therapy and LVEF recovery is monitored using transthoracic echocardiography. Over subsequent 3-12 months 1/3 of these patients will have LVEF recovery, 1/3 will remain the same and 1/3 w ill deteriorate with multiple hospitalizations. However, it is still unknown why some patients recover, but not others. Diffuse Myocardial fibrosis and inflammation play major roles in disease progression and future adverse events. Therefore, the overall objective of this proposal is 1) to evaluate our recently developed whole heart non-invasive quantitative imaging methods to assess myocardial fibrosis and inflammation, 2) to assess the predictive value of novel markers of inflammation and fibrosis in identifying newly diagnosed dilated cardiomyopathy patients who are at risk of developing heart failure, and 3) to assess incremental predictive value of CMR vs. non-CMR parameters for LV remodeling and adverse cardiac events.","8768725; ","NEZAFAT, REZA ;","DANTHI, NARASIMHAN ","05/15/2017","04/30/2021","Adopted; Adverse event; Arrhythmia; Biological Markers; Biopsy; Breathing; Cardiac; Cardiomyopathies; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cardiovascular system; Cicatrix; Clinical; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials; coronary fibrosis; cost; Detection; Development; Diffuse; Dilated Cardiomyopathy; Disease; Disease Progression; Early Diagnosis; Echocardiography; EFRAC; Evaluation; Event; Extracellular Matrix; Fibrosis; follow-up; Future; Goals; Heart; Heart failure; heart imaging; high risk; Hospitalization; human study; imaging biomarker; imaging modality; Impairment; improved; in vivo; Inflammation; interstitial; ionization; Left Ventricular Remodeling; Magnetic Resonance; Maps; Measurement; Measures; Medical; Medicine; Methods; Monitor; Morbidity - disease rate; Morphology; mortality; Myocardial; Myocardial dysfunction; Myocardial tissue; Newly Diagnosed; novel; novel marker; novel strategies; Outcome; outcome forecast; Patient Care; Patient risk; Patients; Performance; Perfusion; Play; Precipitation; Predictive Value; prevent; prognostic; prognostic value; quantitative imaging; Radiation; Recovery; Relaxation; Reproducibility; Resolution; Risk; Risk Factors; Risk stratification; Role; Serum; Slice; soft tissue; Staging; Techniques; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Intervention; Time; Tissues; tool; United States; Vendor; ","Myocardial Tissue Characterization with MR Relaxometry in Heart Failure","129157","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","01","524251","343320","867571",""

Since these findings were made in vitro and it is important to confirm the findings in vivo, we proposed to study how feeding high saturated fatty acid diet and administration of LPS in diabetic animal models increase vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis through an interplay between toll-like receptor (TLR)4 signaling and sphingolipid pathway.

Standard triple or quadruple therapies with acid-blocking medicines and antibiotics have become less effective, falling below 80% success rate because of increasing antibiotic resistance. An understanding of how H. pylori infect the stomach will aid the development of new eradication therapies. A possible strategy to replace current therapy is to target genes that allow the bacteria to survive in acid with non-antibiotic compounds.

Thus, this research is relevant to public health and the VA mission because it will provide the bases for developing novel therapeutic strategies that target osteocytes and protect the skeleton. Alternative treatments for patients suffering bone debilitating conditions, including those resulting from sex hormone deficiency, paralysis, cancer, and aging, will greatly impact the wellbeing of the veteran population, their families, and the general public.","7747807; ","BELLIDO, TERESITA M.;","","10/01/2013","09/30/2017","Adult; Aging; alternative treatment; base; Binding; Biology; bone; bone cell; bone fragility; bone mass; Bone remodeling; Bone Resorption; Calcium; Calvaria; Cell physiology; Cells; Cholecalciferol; Collagen Type I; collagenase 3; cortical bone; cytokine; Data; Disease; Distal; effective intervention; Enhancers; Excision; Exhibits; Extracellular Matrix; Extracellular Matrix Degradation; Family; Functional disorder; General Population; Generations; Genes; Goals; Gonadal Steroid Hormones; Health; Homeostasis; hormone deficiency; Hormones; Human; IL6ST gene; In Vitro; in vivo; Infusion procedures; Lactation; Maintenance; Malignant Neoplasms; Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitor; Matrix Metalloproteinases; Mediating; Membrane; Mission; MMP14 gene; Modeling; Mus; Mutate; novel; novel therapeutics; Organ Culture Techniques; Osteoblasts; osteoclastogenesis; Osteoclasts; Osteocytes; Osteoporosis; Paralysed; Parathyroid Hormone Receptor; Patients; Population; Positioning Attribute; prevent; progenitor; PTH gene; Public Health; Regulation; Research; Resistance; response; Secondary to; Signal Transduction; skeletal; Skeleton; Source; Staging; Testing; Therapeutic; TNFSF11 gene; Up-Regulation; Veterans; Vitamin D3 Receptor; Wild Type Mouse; Work; ","Osteocyte control of bone remodeling through the PTH receptor","002104","ENDB","Endocrinology B ","","","04","","","",""

The one drug approved for ALS is Rilutek. If there is a benefit for ALS patients taking the drug, it may (in selected patients) extend survival by ~3 months. The primary reason that no effective therapies have been developed is that there is a paucity of 'druggable' target proteins known to affect the progression of the disease. This lack of protein targets in ALS is also a problem in other neurodegenerative disorders in which proteins are observed to aggregate. Recent data suggest that in the RNA lariat debranching enzyme Dbr1, there may finally be a druggable enzyme that when inhibited, could provide tangible benefit to veteran and non-veteran ALS patients alike.

Pilot self-report data from rDUI and matched control mothers (sampled from risk strata) and from their adolescent offspring will provide information on maternal AUD course, comorbidity, and offspring early-onset risk behaviors and other adverse outcomes.

The goal of this proposal is to combine clinical psychopathology research and basic neuroscience research to inform the development of novel and effective approaches for personalized treatment of PTSD. PTSD symptom severity in female Veterans is often exacerbated by a history of interpersonal trauma in childhood and as adults, yet this population is largely understudied.

With the average age of female Veterans approaching 48, the incidence of breast cancer in the VA population will start to rise. This escalation will continue because women are now the fastest growing subgroup of U.S. Veterans. Although the incidence of male breast cancer is low, environmental factors experienced in military deployment may lead to an increased risk of breast cancer in both men and women. The assays to be developed in this project will provide clinicians with more reliable means to determine those node-negative patients most likely to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy following surgery for breast cancer. This will result in decreased patient morbidity and mortality providing improved quality of life for Veteran breast cancer patients.

Many depressed patients have recurrences of the illness during their lifetime, so it is likely that a significant proportion of younger female veterans with depression will have this illness develop into a lifetime problem that will occur after menopause. Postmenopausal depressed women treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) often have estrogen added to try to enhance clinical efficacy, but there is little consistent clinical evidence that this is useful.

There remains no reliable treatment modality for acute kidney injury that has impacted the dismal survival statistics. Clearly new approaches are urgently required. In the setting of ischemia or hypoxic injury, early alterations in mitochondrial structure impair cellular energetics, activate cell death pathways, increase oxygen free radical generation and may influence renal hemodynamics. Different models of naturally or experimentally induced resistance to ischemic injury may help to identify biochemical, cellular and physiological events underlying the injury process and provide potential targets for therapeutic intervention. The confluence of data suggests that an enhanced regulation of stress related proteins or mitochondria regulated energetics may impart protection in animal models of resistance to AKI The overarching hypothesis of this application is that mitochondrial adaptation to hypoxia entrains mitochondria toward a biosynthetic activity and decreased ATP generative activity. This adaptation has common features in cells primed by ischemia preconditioning or background genetic traits that confer resistance to ischemia. In these studies, we will utilize two different models of resistance to AKI; 1) a genetic model of the Brown Norway rat and Brown Norway derived consomic strains of rats, and 2) a model of experimentally induced ischemic preconditioning to determine proteins that confer ischemic protection. Studies in specific objective 1 will test the hypothesis that genetic and experimentally induced models of resistance to I/R (ischemia/reperfusion) have common biochemical properties at the level of the mitochondria. These experiments will utilize a proteomic approach of label- free-quantitative mass spectroscopy to identify biochemical similarities in different models of resistance. Studies in specific objective 2 will investigate the potential protective effect of proteins identified in resistant states. Mitochondrial targeted genes derived from specific aim 1 will be tested an in vitro model of proximal tubule cells and the preservation of mitochondrial function and cellular integrity in response to hypoxia evaluated. Studies in specific objective 3 will evaluate the effec of mitochondrial targeting on the short and long-term response to kidney injury in vivo. Specific objective 4 will study how mitochondria adapt in response to transgene expression, ischemia preconditioning or genetic modifications. These studies will investigate post-ischemic mitochondria respiratory capacity, mitochondrial polarization and the resulting influence on ROS generation and renal hemodynamics.

TBI is a well-established risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementing neurological disorders. Thus, there is concern that blast-exposed Veterans face significant risk of developing service-related cognitive dysfunction and dementia.

Hypertension is even more prevalent in the Veteran's Health Administration (VHA), with almost 50% of enrollees carrying a diagnosis of hypertension. The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and thiazide- sensitive sodium chloride cotransporter (NCC) are sodium transporters that play a key role in blood pressure regulation. Increases in activity of either result in hypertension and decreases in activity result in low blood pressure. Understanding the association of these important proteins could lead to the development of new medications and to better use of medications that we already have. The potential impact of these studies on the most prevalent disease in modern society is significant.","1879690; ","HOOVER, ROBERT S;","","10/01/2015","09/30/2019","Address; Adult; Aldosterone; Animals; apical membrane; base; Binding; Biotinylation; Blood Pressure; blood pressure reduction; blood pressure regulation; Carrier Proteins; Cell model; Cells; Co-Immunoprecipitations; Complex; Confocal Microscopy; Data; Development; Diagnosis; Disease; Distal; Distal convoluted renal tubule structure; Diuretics; Electron Microscopy; Epithelial; epithelial Na+ channel; Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer; Gene Silencing; health administration; Hyperactive behavior; Hypertension; Hypotension; Immunoblotting; Immunohistochemistry; implantation; In Vitro; in vivo; inhibitor/antagonist; Kidney; knock-down; Lead; Lysine; Mammalian Cell; Mass Spectrum Analysis; Measurement; Mediating; Methodology; Methods; Modeling; Mus; Nephrons; Operative Surgical Procedures; osmotic minipump; particle; patch clamp; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phosphorylation; Phosphotransferases; Physiological; Play; Population; Property; protein expression; Proteins; public health relevance; Regulation; Reporting; response; salt balance; Sgk protein; Signal Transduction; SLC12A3 gene; small hairpin RNA; Societies; Sodium; Sodium Channel; Sodium Chloride; Surface; symporter; Systemic blood pressure; thiazide; Transfection; United States; uptake; Veterans; ","NCC and ENaC form a Sodium Transporting Complex","002322","NEPH","Nephrology ","","","02","","","",""

We will further develop this concept in the lab by studying combinations of drugs that inhibit T-cell costimulation and cytokine activation pathways to reduce GVHD in mice.

The goal of this proposal is to understand how IL-10-mediated regulation of astrocytes is impaired in the aged brain, and how this problem leads to exaggerated microglial activation and the development of depressive-like behavior following immune challenge. In this application, we will use a murine model of aging to test the hypothesis that prolonged neuroinflammation and the development of depressive-like behavior in the aged following a peripheral inflammatory challenge is caused by impaired astrocyte-dependent regulation of microglia. Completion of these studies will lead to novel interventions to enhance astrocyte sensitivity to IL-10 and attenuate prolonged neurobehavioral complications associated with peripheral immune challenge in the aged.","8471081; ","GODBOUT, JONATHAN P.;","WISE, BRADLEY C.","08/01/2016","04/30/2021","Acute; Address; Adult; Affect; Age; age related; aged; Aging; aging brain; Anti-inflammatory; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Astrocytes; Attenuated; base; Behavior; Behavioral; Brain; Bypass; Cells; Coculture Techniques; Communication; cytokine; Data; Delirium; Dependovirus; depressive symptoms; Development; Elderly; Failure; Feedback; gene therapy; Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein; Goals; Health; Immune; Immune response; Immune system; Impaired cognition; Impairment; improved; in vivo; Incidence; Infection; Inflammatory; Infusion procedures; innovation; Interleukin-1; Interleukin-1 beta; Interleukin-10; Intervention; Lead; Lipopolysaccharides; Longevity; Major Depressive Disorder; Mediating; Mental Depression; Messenger RNA; Microglia; Molecular Profiling; Morphology; mouse model; Mus; nano-string; neurobehavioral; Neuroglia; neuroinflammation; neuropsychiatry; novel; Peripheral; prevent; Process; Production; programs; protein expression; Proteins; Quality of life; receptor; Regulation; Reporting; Resolution; restoration; Serotyping; Signal Transduction; Sorting - Cell Movement; Testing; Transforming Growth Factor beta; vector; Viral Genes; ","Consequences of Age-Related Impairments in the Dynamic Regulation of Active Microglia by Astrocytes","051902","NNRS","Neuroendocrinology, Neuroimmunology, Rhythms and Sleep Study Section ","","","02","254095","128289","382384",""

However, an overly vigorous immune response can cause damage to sensitive tissues. Thus, in some cases where the pathogen (or tumor) is not efficiently cleared, there exist mechanisms to impair further activity of that particular immune response. While this may spare the host from immune-mediated damage, it can also allow certain viruses (like HIV) to establish reservoirs in the body; it may also allow tumors to ?escape? further interference from the immune system. The studies proposed in this application will deepen our knowledge of this phenomenon, sometimes called ?immune exhaustion,? by defining the role of a specific protein known as Tim-3, which has recently been implicated in this process.","1868435; ","KANE, LAWRENCE P;","MALLIA, CONRAD M.","05/18/2017","04/30/2019","abstracting; Acute; Adverse effects; Alleles; Antibodies; Antigen Receptors; Antigens; Award; Bacteria; base; Biological Models; Blocking Antibodies; CD3 Antigens; Cell physiology; cell type; Cells; Chronic; Clinical Trials; clinically relevant; CRISPR/Cas technology; crosslink; Cytoplasmic Tail; Data; Development; Excision; exhaust; exhaustion; experimental study; Exposure to; Functional disorder; Future; Gene Expression; Generations; Genetic; HIV; HIV Infections; Immune; Immune response; Immune system; Immunity; Immunotherapy; Individual; Infection; Integral Membrane Protein; Knock-out; Knockout Mice; Knowledge; Length; Licensing; Life; Ligands; Link; Listeria; LoxP-flanked allele; Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus; Maintenance; Malignant neoplasm of lung; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; melanoma; Membrane Proteins; Modeling; mouse model; Mus; Mutagenesis; Nature; novel; Outcome; pathogen; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Patients; Phase; Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases; Population; prevent; Process; protein biomarkers; Proteins; Publishing; Reagent; Reporting; response; Role; Seminal; Series; Signal Transduction; Solid Neoplasm; Structure; T cell response; T memory cell; T-Cell Activation; T-Cell Development; T-Lymphocyte; targeted treatment; Testing; therapeutic target; Tissues; tumor; Up-Regulation; Viral reservoir; Virus; Virus Diseases; Work; ","Novel mouse models for studying Tim-3 signaling","131049","CMIB","Cellular and Molecular Immunology - B Study Section ","","A1","01","50000","27113","77113",""

Given 25 million Veterans and 45 million family members, there are about 100,000 Veterans, Active Duty Service members, and Dependents with PKD. As a kidney doctor at the VA, and in the Army National Guard, I frequently see patients with ADPKD, and, sometimes, nephronophthisis, and it is difficult to tell them there are no approved treatments, and all therapies in clinical trials have significant toxicity and/or side effects. PKD is characterized by cystic overgrowth that destroys the kidney. An organelle called the cilium has been strongly implicated in PKD pathogenesis and we showed that the exocyst complex and Cdc42, which regulates the exocyst, are necessary for cilia formation, both in cell culture and in animals. Here, we will determine how Cdc42 and the exocyst build cilia, and then test two possible treatments for PKD.","1903130; ","LIPSCHUTZ, JOSHUA H;","","07/01/2010","09/30/2019","adeno-associated viral vector; Adverse effects; Affect; Age; American; Animal Model; Animals; Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney; base; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell Line; Cells; Cessation of life; Child; Cilia; ciliopathy; cilium biogenesis; Clinical Trials; Complex; Cyst; Data; Defect; Disease; Docking; experimental study; Family; Family member; Future; Gene Expression; Gene Proteins; Genes; Genetic; Goals; Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors; Hereditary Disease; Human; In Vitro; in vivo; Inherited; intersectin 1; Kidney; Kidney Failure; knock-down; Knock-out; Laboratories; Lead; LoxP-flanked allele; Maintenance; MAP Kinase Gene; Maps; Mendelian disorder; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Inhibitor; Modeling; Molecular Biology; Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins; mouse model; Mus; Mutation; nephrogenesis; Nephronophthisis; new therapeutic target; novel; Organelles; overexpression; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Patients; Phenotype; polycystic kidney disease 1 protein; Polycystic Kidney Diseases; Positioning Attribute; prevent; Prevention; Process; Proteins; public health relevance; Reagent; Recombinants; Recruitment Activity; Renal tubule structure; Role; Route; service member; Structure; System; Techniques; Testing; Therapeutic Intervention; therapeutic target; tool; Toxic effect; trans-Golgi Network; Vesicle; Veterans; Work; young adult; Zebrafish; ","Cdc-42 and the Exocyst in Ciliogenesis and Polycystic Kidney Disease","000820","NEPH","Nephrology ","","","06","","","",""

How HSP70 does this is not entirely clear, so we carried out a proteomics analysis in animal brains subjected to stroke to determine which proteins were most changed when HSP70 was overexpressed. This analysis showed that dynamin, a protein involved in cellular uptake of molecules, is increased after stroke, but is suppressed by HSP70. What dynamin is doing during stroke and whether this has anything to do with the therapeutic effect of HSP70 is completely unknown. We propose to explore whether dynamin contributes to stroke injury, and if blocking it is therapeutic. Stroke afflicts many veterans.

Salmonella are among the increasing number of medically important multidrug resistant bacteria. Salmonella and antibiotic-resistant bacteria cause high morbidity and mortality around the globe, including veterans and patients in VA hospitals. Our investigations have revealed that the conserved RNA polymerase-binding protein DksA is essential to Salmonella pathogenesis. Our investigations will characterize the novel role of the DksA zinc finger in coordinating transcriptional responses to various levels of oxidative stress encountered by Salmonella in the host. Based on our basic knowledge of DksA, we have already identified a drug against DksA with excellent antibiotic activity. Our investigations will guide the rational development of antibiotics against DksA and will test their effectiveness against drug resistant nontyphoidal Salmonella as well as a variety of Gram-negative clinical isolates.","2239605; ","VAZQUEZ-TORRES, ANDRES ;","","04/01/2013","03/31/2021","Affect; alpha helix; Antibiotic Resistance; Antibiotics; Antioxidants; arm; Bacillus (bacterium); Bacteria; Bacterial Genes; Bacterial Infections; bacterial resistance; base; Binding; Binding Proteins; C-terminal; Campylobacter; Cessation of life; Clinical; clinically relevant; Coiled-Coil Domain; Complex; Cysteine; Development; Diarrhea; Disease; disulfide bond; DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase; drug development; Drug resistance; drug resistant bacteria; Drug Targeting; Effectiveness; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli EHEC; Eubacterium; experimental study; extracellular; Family; Future; Gastroenteritis; Gene Expression; General Population; Genes; genetic regulatory protein; Genetic Transcription; Gram-Negative Bacteria; Hemophilus; HIV; Hospitals; Human; Individual; Infection; innovation; Intervention; Investigation; Knowledge; Lead; Legionella pneumophila; Life; Mammals; Mediating; men; Metabolic Control; Metabolism; microorganism; Military Personnel; Modeling; Molecular; Molecular Analysis; Molecular Chaperones; Molecular Target; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Multi-Drug Resistance; N-terminal; novel; Output; oxidation; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidative Stress; Oxidoreductase; Pathogenesis; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Play; programs; Prokaryotic Cells; prophylactic; Proteins; Pseudomonas; Regulation; Research; Resistance; response; Role; Salmonella; Salmonella enterica; sensor; Shigella; Shigella flexneri bacterium; stem; Stress; Structure; Sulfenic Acids; Sulfhydryl Compounds; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Agents; Transcriptional Regulation; Veterans; Vibrio; Vibrio cholerae; Virulence; Woman; Work; Zinc Fingers; ","Molecular Analysis of Bacterial Adaptive Response to Host Reactive Species","002073","INFB","Infectious Diseases B ","","A1","05","","","",""

This project is to use the well-defined genetic model to understand the mechanisms regulating the biosynthesis, degradation and subcellular localization of FUS. The results from studying the mutant FUS mediated familial ALS will provide critical insights into the pathology of all types of ALS.

Therefore, preventing neuronal death in TBI and TON is crucial to preserve function. This study will characterize the vulnerability of RGCs to glutamate excitotoxicity and TON, investigate the roles of TCR to the vulnerability of RGCs and determine the therapeutic potential of protecting RGC from death by activating TCR in the retina.

In patients with diabetes, elevated glucose levels in the blood lead to increased glucose within the retina by transport through special glucose transporters on cells that form the blood-retina-barrier. Diabetic retinopathy is a vision-threatening disorder characterized by a constellation of problems that arise within the eye as a result of the elevated glucose levels in the retina. Because diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of new cases of blindness among adults aged 20-74, it is important to examine how this disorder develops due to elevated glucose and identify new therapies that aid in the treatment of veterans with diabetes for the prevention of diabetic retinopathy and blindness.","7028224; ","SAMUELS, IVY S;","","10/01/2015","09/30/2019","Abate; Adult; Affect; aged; apical membrane; Background Diabetic Retinopathy; base; basolateral membrane; Binding; Biological Markers; Blindness; Blood; Blood Glucose; blood glucose regulation; Blood-Retinal Barrier; Cell Culture Techniques; Cells; Clinical; Clinical Trials; Defect; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetes prevention; diabetes risk; diabetic; Diabetic mouse; Diabetic Retinopathy; Diffusion; Disease; Electron Microscopy; Electroretinography; Event; experimental study; Eye; Functional disorder; Generations; Genes; Glucose; glucose analog; glucose monitor; glucose transport; Glucose Transporter; glycemic control; Goals; Hyperglycemia; Hyperglycemic Mice; Image; In Vitro; in vivo; innovation; Insulin; Insulin Receptor; insulin signaling; Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; Laboratories; Leukostasis; Measures; Mediating; Membrane; Methods; microvascular pathology; Modeling; Molecular; mouse model; Mus; novel; novel therapeutics; Pathology; Patients; Phase; Photoreceptors; Play; prevent; Prevention; Preventive therapy; public health relevance; Reagent; Receptor Signaling; Regulation; Research; Resources; Retina; Retinal; Retinal Diseases; Risk Factors; Role; Serum; Severities; Signal Transduction; SLC2A1 gene; Staging; Structure of retinal pigment epithelium; success; Superoxides; Symptoms; targeted treatment; Techniques; Testing; Therapeutic Intervention; Time; ubiquitin-protein ligase; United States; Veterans; Vision; whole blood lead; Work; ","Glucose transport in the diabetic outer retina.","002754","NURF","Neurobiology F ","","","02","","","",""

A well-functioning AVF is of course a 'lifeline' for veterans on hemodialysis, while on the other hand a dysfunctional AVF can become the 'Achilles heel' of the hemodialysis patient. It is likely that the studies described in this proposal could result in new therapies for AVF failure and so significantly reduce both the comorbidities and cost associated with AVF failure. More importantly, the information obtained from this proposal could allow us to better understand the impact of kidney failure or uremia on the vascular system (blood vessels) of patients with ESRD. This would likely have a huge clinical impact, because patients with ESRD suffer from aggressive atherosclerotic vascular disease and also have a poorer response to interventions such as angioplasty (balloon dilatation of a vessel).","6876732; ","ROY-CHAUDHURY, PRABIR ;","","10/01/2013","09/30/2018","Address; Angioplasty; Animal Model; Animals; Arteriovenous fistula; Atherosclerosis; Balloon Dilatation; Bioinformatics; Biological; Biology; Blood flow; Blood Vessels; Caliber; Chronic Kidney Failure; Clinical; clinically relevant; Comorbidity; Complex; Control Animal; Control Groups; cost; Development; Dialysis procedure; Dilatation - action; effective therapy; End stage renal failure; endothelial dysfunction; Epidemic; Event; Exposure to; Failure; Family suidae; Functional disorder; Future; Gene Expression; Genes; Genomics; Grant; Head; Health; Hemodialysis; hemodynamics; Histology; Hyperplasia; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Injury; innovation; Intervention; Kidney Failure; Knowledge; knowledge base; Light; Link; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Measures; Modeling; next generation sequencing; novel; novel therapeutics; Outcome; Oxidative Stress; Pathway interactions; Patients; Phenotype; predictive marker; prevent; response; response to injury; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Risk Factors; RNA; RNA Sequences; Sampling; shear stress; Stenosis; Stress; success; System; Technology; Thick; Time; Tissue Sample; United States; Uremia; Vascular Diseases; Vascular System; Venous; Veterans; Work; ","Hemodynamics, Uremia & Vascular Biology: Interactive Pathways for AVF Maturation","002390","NEPH","Nephrology ","","","04","","","",""

At the same time, the fastest growing segment of the population is precisely this group at greatest risk. According to the World Health Organization, the number of people worldwide aged 80 years and older will quadruple between 2000 and 2050; this population is sometimes referred to as the 'oldest old', and has historically been under- represented in osteoporosis studies. At age 50 years, a woman in the U.S. has approximately a 1 in 2 and a man has a 1 in 4 chance of experiencing a major fracture in their remaining lifetime. A majority of osteoporotic fractures occur after a low trauma fall, with 1 in 3 adults over age 65 years falling experiencing at least 1 fall annually, and 1 in every 10-12 falls resulting in a fracture. Thus, fall and fracture prevention in older adults are integrally linked.

The novelty of this investigation comes from our being able to grow in the test tube Tregs that are specific and suppress immune reactions against the recipient of the transplant. The objective of this application is to conduct a first-in-human trialof Tregs grown in the test tube for the purpose of preventing GVHD. We expect that donor Tregs specific for the recipient's antigens will prevent GVHD more effectively than current standard immune suppressive drugs and preserve immunity to viral pathogens and cancer-associated antigens. Successful completion of the proposed aims has high likelihood to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field of transplantation, change the technology utilized for GVHD prevention, improve the safety profile of allogeneic stem cell transplantation, and enhance transplant utilization for patients with hematological malignancies and non-malignant blood or immune disorders.","1954478; ","ANASETTI, CLAUDIO ;","LEVY, CATHERINE L.","08/01/2013","04/30/2018","Acute Graft Versus Host Disease; Address; Adoptive Immunotherapy; Adoptive Transfer; Adult; Alloantigen; Allogenic; Allografting; Antigen-Presenting Cells; Antigens; BCL2 gene; Blood; cancer cell; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Cell Count; chemokine receptor; Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease; clinical application; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials; Complication; Cytomegalovirus; Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated Protein 4; Data; Dendritic Cells; Deuterium; Development; disorder prevention; Donor person; Dose; Drug Combinations; Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes; Equilibrium; Excision; Frequencies; Goals; Graft Rejection; Graft-vs-Host Disease; Health; Hematologic Neoplasms; Hematological Disease; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Homing; Human; Human Herpesvirus 4; Immune; Immune response; Immune System Diseases; Immunity; immunoreaction; Immunosuppressive Agents; improved; in vivo; Incidence; Interleukin-10; Interleukin-15; Interleukin-2; Investigation; Label; leukemia; Life; Lymphoid; Lymphoid Tissue; Lymphoma; Malignant Neoplasms; Methotrexate; Minor Histocompatibility Antigens; mortality; Multiple Myeloma; Natural immunosuppression; Non-Malignant; Opportunistic Infections; Organ; Organ Transplantation; pathogen; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase; phase I trial; Pre-Clinical Model; prevent; Prevention; Prophylactic treatment; prospective; Randomized; receptor; reconstitution; Recovery; Regulation; Regulatory T-Lymphocyte; Relapse; Research; response; Risk; Rodent; Rodent Model; Safety; SELL gene; Severities; Siblings; Sirolimus; Stem cell transplant; Stem cells; T-Lymphocyte; Tacrolimus; Technology; Testing; Therapeutic; Transplant Recipients; Transplantation; Tube; tumor; Umbilical Cord Blood; Viral; WT1 gene; ","Adoptive Transfer of Donor Tregs Specific Against Host Alloantigens for Presentio","114994","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","05","323564","232966","556530",""

During mitosis, BubR1 delays the onset of anaphase until each chromosome is properly aligned at the metaphase plate for proper attached to bipolar spindles, and loss of BubR1 therefore leads to aneuploidy and an increased incidence of cancer. Interestingly, recent studies have also shed light on a role for BubR1 in regulating the aging process by controlling cellular senescence. Age is one of the greatest risk factors for cancer, and results from the proposed studies will provide a greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving the interrelationship between aging and cancer, thereby providing impetus for more specific therapeutic targets for age-related diseases such as cancer.","8504516; ","NORTH, BRIAN J;","VELAZQUEZ, JOSE M.","09/30/2016","04/30/2021","abstracting; Acetylation; Address; Age; age related; aged; Aging; Aging-Related Process; Anaphase; Aneuploidy; Animals; Automobile Driving; base; Birth; Caloric Restriction; cancer therapy; Cell Aging; Cells; Chromosome Segregation; Chromosomes; Deacetylase; Deacetylation; Development; Disease; Engineering; Ensure; Exhibits; Genetic Materials; genome integrity; Goals; Human; In Vitro; in vivo; Incidence; Individual; Light; Link; Longevity; Malignant Neoplasms; Mammals; Mediating; Metaphase Plate; Mitosis; Mitotic; Modification; Molecular; mouse model; Mus; Mutation; overexpression; Pathway interactions; Phenotype; Phosphorylation; Physiological; Play; pleiotropism; Post-Translational Protein Processing; Predisposition; Premature aging syndrome; prevent; Process; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; Proteins; Regulation; Risk Factors; Rodent Model; Role; segregation; senescence; Signal Pathway; Therapeutic; therapeutic target; Tissues; tumor; Tumor Suppressor Proteins; tumorigenesis; Ubiquitination; ","Mechanisms Controlling BubR1 Regulation of Cancer and Aging","052627","NIA","Neuroscience of Aging Review Committee ","","","02","114725","9178","123903",""

Recent data reveals that even with acceptable viral loads as many as 50% of patients with HIV display mild cognitive dysfunction when carefully examined. The economic impact of mild cognitive impairment associated with either HIV infection or the medical therapy of treating HIV infection is just beginning to be understood. Depressed mood, malaise, and lack of concentration are insidious in onset but may hinder a veteran's access to treatment and their ability to remain employed.

While early stage lung cancer can be treated by surgical resection, chemotherapy remains the mainstay for treatment for locally advanced and metastatic disease. Cisplatin or its analog carboplatin is one of the main drugs which has been utilized for the treatment of both small cell and non small cell lung cancer. Development of platinum resistance is inevitable and hinders the likelihood of achieving remission and hence leads to poor survival. We have found that all cisplatin resistant lung cancer cells express higher baseline levels of oxidative stress. Moreover, these resistant cells appear to change their metabolic pathway in order to adapt to survive under high oxidative stress condition. By identifying and targeting this pathway, cisplatin resistant cells can be selectively killed.

Tumor growth is fueled by intra-tumor androgen. Our new results show that in some patients, tumors make very little of the enzyme SULT2B, which normally inhibits intra-prostate androgen production. We will assess whether SULT2B status in prostate tumor can reliably predict risks for aggressive cancer. The mechanism for SULT2B loss and ability for receptor proteins LXR and VDR to reverse loss will be explored. Our second novel result is that androgen receptor (AR), which mediates androgen action, is methylated in prostate cancer cells. Methylated AR is more potent than unmethylated AR in mediating androgen action, thus bolstering androgen's role in promoting tumor growth. We will explore why methylated AR shows enhanced activity, and whether its level increases in prostate cancer.","1871291; ","CHATTERJEE, BANDANA ;","","04/01/2009","09/30/2017","African American; Agonist; Anabolism; Androgen Antagonists; Androgen Receptor; Androgens; Antibodies; Attenuated; Automobile Driving; base; Biochemical; Biological Assay; Biopsy; Calcitriol; cancer cell; castration resistant prostate cancer; Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure; Cholesterol; Chromatin; Clinical; college; Computer Simulation; CpG Islands; dehydroepiandrosterone; dehydroepiandrosterone sulfotransferase; design; Diagnosis; DNA; DNA Methylation; Elements; Enzymes; Epithelial Cell Proliferation; Foundations; Gene Expression; Genes; Genomic DNA; Goals; Growth; Histones; Homeostasis; Hormonal; Human; Hypermethylation; In Vitro; in vivo; Indolent; Intervention; KDM1A gene; knock-down; Knockout Mice; Laboratories; Lead; Ligand Binding; Link; Liver X Receptor; Locally Advanced Malignant Neoplasm; Lysine; Malignant neoplasm of prostate; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; Medicine; Messenger RNA; Methods; Methylation; Methyltransferase; Modeling; Molecular; Mus; mutant; Neoplasm Metastasis; new therapeutic target; novel; novel strategies; Nuclear Receptors; outcome forecast; Pathologist; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; predictive marker; prevent; Production; promoter; Prostate; prostate cancer cell; Prostatic Neoplasms; Proteins; public health relevance; pyrosequencing; Race; receptor; receptor binding; Receptor Signaling; Recurrence; Regulation; Regulator Genes; Reporting; response; Risk; Role; Sampling; Serinus; Signal Pathway; Site; Specimen; Staining method; Stains; stem; Steroids; Sterols; Steryl-sulfatase; Subfamily lentivirinae; sulfation; sulfotransferase; SULT2B1; synergism; Tissue Microarray; Tissues; TNFRSF10A gene; Transactivation; tumor; tumor growth; tumor progression; Tumor Tissue; tumor xenograft; Vitamin D3 Receptor; Western Blotting; ","Regulation of Intratumor Androgen/Androgen Receptor signaling in Prostrate Cancer","000280","ONCA","Oncology A ","","","08","","","",""

Epidemiological studies suggest that depression and depression-related suicide are major sources of disability and mortality in veterans, as well as in civilians. Despite knowledge of this problem and efforts to reduce it, the incidence of depression and suicide has not declined, and may be rising. Medications currently available to treat depression all target essentially the same pathway, monoamine neurotransmission. Although effective for some patients with depression, these medications unfortunately fail to benefit a large number of patients. Thus, new treatments with novel mechanisms of action are needed. Our preliminary studies suggest a novel mode of synaptic transmission mediated by protons in the nucleus accumbens. Our research proposal will test the potential interaction between the molecules mediating this signal and emotional stress.

In particular, coronary heart disease (CHD) is characterized by narrowing of the blood vessels that supply blood flow to the heart, leading to heart attack and ultimately heart failure. Understanding how to engineer biological replacement cardiac tissue is important for developing effective treatments for CHD in our Veterans. We believe that using scaffolds that guide the organization of cardiac cells will help to scale-up the size of engineered tissues, due to the ability of the scaffolds to maintain cell survival and promote cardiac health. Importantly, we will examine the biochemical processes that help improve cardiac cell survival and function within the cardiac patches. Together, these studies offer great hope to the development of therapies that for treating Veterans with CHD.","9408579; ","HUANG, NGAN F.;","","10/01/2014","09/30/2018","Action Potentials; American; angiogenesis; Animals; Autologous; Automobile Driving; base; Biochemical Process; Biological; Biological Assay; bioluminescence imaging; Blood flow; Blood Vessels; Calcium Signaling; Cardiac; Cardiac health; Cardiac Myocytes; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cardiovascular system; Cause of Death; Cell Communication; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell physiology; Cell Survival; Cell Therapy; Cell Transplants; Cells; Cellular Morphology; Cellular Structures; Chemicals; Cicatrix; clinical development; Clinical Trials; Coculture Techniques; Collagen; Coronary artery; Coronary heart disease; Coupling; Cues; effective therapy; Endothelial Cells; Engineering; Epicardium; Extracellular Matrix; Foundations; functional improvement; Gap Junctions; Generations; Genetic; Goals; Health; Heart; Heart failure; Human; Implant; improved; induced pluripotent stem cell; Infarction; Injection of therapeutic agent; insight; Ischemia; Knowledge; Ligation; loss of function; Measurement; Measures; Mediating; Methods; Modeling; Molecular; Monitor; Morphology; mortality; Myocardial; Myocardial Infarction; Myocardial Ischemia; Myocardial tissue; Myocardium; nanopattern; Natural regeneration; Nitric Oxide; Phenotype; Physiological; Population; Production; Pump; Rattus; release factor; repaired; Research; Role; scaffold; scale up; Signal Transduction; Signaling Molecule; Source; Structure; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Effect; therapy development; Thick; Time; Tissue Engineering; tissue repair; Tissues; tool; Transplantation; Ventricular Ejection Fractions; Veterans; ","Vascularized Cardiac Patch with Physiological Orientation for Myocardial Repair","002310","SURG","Surgery ","","","03","","","",""

It ecessitates hip replacement in about 50,000 people in the US annually, including in many Veterans. We discovered that a large component of osteonecrosis is not caused directly by GC, but by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH is reduced to very low levels by GC treatment. Specifcally, ACTH causes bone cells to make VEGF, a major growth and survival factor. The work here will defne the downstream actions of ACTH in human bone cells and in a mouse model, including the interactions of ACTH with other systems that regulate VEGF. Addition- ally, how ACTH action varies with time or quantity of administration will be determined using rabbits, the best animal model. This will establish new mechanisms that contribute to osteonecrosis, which may allow reduction of the severity, or prevention entirely, of a common type of osteonecrosis.","1881296; ","BLAIR, HARRY C.;","","10/01/2014","09/30/2018","Acetates; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Adrenal Glands; Ally; Animal Model; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip; autocrine; Biological Assay; Blood capillaries; Blood Vessels; bone; bone cell; Bone Growth; Bone necrosis; bone turnover; capillary; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell Hypoxia; Cell Proliferation; Cells; Cessation of life; Circadian Rhythms; Complex; Corticotropin; Corticotropin Receptors; cytokine; Data; Dependency; Diabetes Mellitus; Differentiation and Growth; Dose; Endothelial Growth Factors Receptor; Event; Feedback; Frequencies; Glucocorticoids; Growth; Head; Health; Hour; Human; human disease; Hypoxia; Immune; In Vitro; in vivo; in vivo Model; Inflammatory; Injection of therapeutic agent; innovation; Insulin; Knockout Mice; Light; Lymphocyte; macrophage; Measures; Mediating; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Metabolic; Methods; Methylprednisolone; Modeling; mouse model; Mus; novel; Oryctolagus cuniculus; Osteoblasts; Oxygen; Pilot Projects; Pituitary Gland; Prevention; Process; Production; Regulation; Regulatory Pathway; response; Serum; Severities; Signal Transduction; Steroids; substantia spongiosa; System; Time; tissue culture; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors; VEGFA gene; Veterans; Work; ","Regulation of Osteoblasts by ACTH and VEGF","002490","ENDA","Endocriniology A ","","","03","","","",""
