The current knowledge of the molecular genetic pathways that control neuronal development is incomplete. Our research program addresses three major questions related to the assembly of neural circuits: 1) How do transcription factors that control neuronal subtype identity coordinate the expression of axon guidance molecules that control wiring specificity? 2) What are the signaling mechanisms that allow conserved families of guidance receptors to control direction-selective axon growth and targeting? 3) How do navigating axons coordinate their responses to the diverse array of cues present during development to ensure assembly of functional circuits? Disruption of the function of many axon guidance molecules has been implicated in a number of human neuronal developmental disorders, as well as in various kinds of cancer. Thus, understanding the signaling mechanisms of these molecules in the context of normal development will be instrumental in understanding how their perturbation leads to pathogenesis.","7992862; ","BASHAW, GREG J.;","RIDDLE, ROBERT D.","12/15/2016","11/30/2024","Address; Area; Axon; axon growth; axon guidance; Biochemical; Biological; Cell Nucleus; Cells; Collaborations; Cues; Dendrites; Development; developmental disease/disorder; Disease; Drosophila genus; Embryonic Nervous System; Ensure; Family; Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting; genetic manipulation; Genetic Transcription; Human; in vitro activity; in vivo; Injury; insight; Knowledge; Link; Malignant Neoplasms; Methods; Modeling; Molecular; Molecular Biology; Molecular Genetics; Morphogenesis; Motor Neurons; mutant; Nerve Regeneration; nervous system development; Nervous system structure; neural circuit; neuron development; Neurons; Output; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Play; premature; programs; Property; Proteins; receptor; Receptor Activation; Receptor Signaling; Regulation; relating to nervous system; repaired; Reporter; Research; Resolution; response; Role; screening; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Signaling Molecule; Specific qualifier value; Specificity; System; Testing; Therapeutic; Transcript; Transcription Coactivator; transcription factor; Work; ","Molecular mechanisms of axon guidance receptor regulation and signaling","097340","ZNS1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","329660","196876","526536",""

However, the novel incorporation of age-specific metrics, such as frailty, systemic inflammation, and adverse health outcomes of aging, will greatly improve clinical decision-making in older adults considering kidney transplantation. The goal of this project is to develop a prediction model for adverse health outcomes of aging (cognitive dysfunction, ADL disability, depression and low quality of life) in a cohort of dialysis patients and a second cohort of KT recipients. Our exploration of novel predictors and outcomes specific to older ESRD patients will directly benefit this population, and their providers, by informing risk prediction, helping guide clinical decision making, and possibly even providing insights into underlying biological processes.","9621244; ","MCADAMS DEMARCO, MARA A.;","SALIVE, MARCEL ","12/01/2013","11/30/2018","Accounting; Activities of Daily Living; Adult; adverse outcome; Age; age group; Aging; Allografting; base; Biological Process; Biology; career; Cessation of life; clinical decision-making; cohort; Communities; Comorbidity; Control Groups; Counseling; Data; Decision Making; design; Development; Dialysis patients; Dialysis procedure; disability; Disease Outcome; Elderly; End stage renal failure; Environment; experience; Faculty; falls; frailty; Functional disorder; Funding; Generic Drugs; Goals; Grant; Health; high risk; Hospital Readmission; Hospitalization; Impaired cognition; improved; Inflammation; Inflammatory; inflammatory marker; insight; Interleukin-1 beta; Interleukin-18; Interleukin-6; Kidney Diseases; Kidney Failure; Kidney Transplantation; Link; Measures; Mediating; meetings; Mental Depression; Mentorship; Modality; Modeling; mortality; novel; older patient; Outcome; outcome prediction; Pathway interactions; Patient risk; Patient-Focused Outcomes; Patients; Physiological; Population; Predictive Value; prospective; Provider; Publishing; Quality of life; Race; Registries; Research; response; Risk; Risk Factors; Role; Serum; sex; stressor; Survival Analysis; survival prediction; Syndrome; Testing; Time; TimeLine; TNF gene; Transforming Growth Factor beta; Treatment outcome; trend; United States; Work; ","Frailty and Adverse Health Outcomes of Aging in Older Adults with Kidney Failure","043501","NIA","Neuroscience of Aging Review Committee ","","","04","112485","8999","121484",""

In 2010, individuals 15-20 years old were more than four times as likely to be involved in car crashes compared to any other age group, and in more than one-fourth of car crashes involving adolescent drivers, one or more drivers involved in the crash had been drinking alcohol (CDC, 2010).

In the past 5 years my laboratory has provided evidence that over- expression of a pentapeptide called opiorphin in corporal tissue plays a key role in the development of priapism; this proposal will substantiate and elaborate on the mechanisms by which opiorphin is involved in the development of priapism associated with sickle cell disease. As part of these studies we will investigate the ability of a novel investigative tool (paramagnetic nanoparticles carrying opiorphin- siRNA specifically targeted to the penis by externally applied magnets) to prevent the development of priapism in a mouse model of sickle cell disease which if successful would have great potential for clinical translation into a therapeutic agent to treat or prevent priapism in sickle cell patients.","6156658; ","DAVIES, KELVIN P;","RANKIN, TRACY L.","01/15/2016","11/30/2020","Affect; Age; Animal Model; Animal Organ; base; Bathing; Bilateral; blebbistatin; Blood; Blood flow; Brain Hypoxia-Ischemia; Cell Line; Cells; Clinical; Clinical Research; Complex; Dependence; Development; Event; Family; Gene Activation; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Regulation; gene function; Gene Transfer; gene transfer vector; Genes; Health; Human; Hypoxia; In Vitro; in vivo; Intervention; knock-down; Laboratories; Lead; Life; Mediating; men; Modeling; mouse model; Mus; Muscle; Muscle relaxants; Muscle relaxation phase; Muscle Tonus; nanoparticle; novel; Organ; overexpression; Pathway interactions; Patients; penis; Peptides; Pharmacological Treatment; Play; prevent; Priapism; Publishing; Rattus; Regulation; Relaxation; research study; response; Role; Sickle Cell; Sickle Cell Anemia; Small Interfering RNA; Smooth Muscle; Smooth Muscle Myocytes; Staging; Structure of internal iliac artery; System; Testing; Therapeutic Agents; Tissues; tool; Topical application; Translations; Up-Regulation; Work; ","Opiorphin as a master regulator of pathways leading to priapism","107807","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","263251","176378","439629",""

While its function in cancer cells is known, its role in the heart, wherein Tip60 is enriched, is unknown. Based on Tip60's integrated functions in cancer cells, the proposed work addresses its possible cardiac roles, which aren't mutually exclusive. First, the investigators are assessing whether Tip60 becomes associated with the tips of chromosomes in heart cells at the time of birth to induce the mechanism by which DNA is repaired, which in turn causes cardiac muscle cells (CMs) to enter their persistent non- proliferative state. Second, because Tip60 is known to induce cell death (apoptosis), the investigators are addressing the possibility that its inactivation during a heart attack inhibits this process, protecting the heart from CM death. Results will advance our understanding of why CMs can't proliferate to repair the damaged heart, and whether drug-induced inactivation of Tip60 can prevent effects of a heart attack.","1866717 (contact); 1962483; ","AUCHAMPACH, JOHN A (contact); LOUGH, JOHN W;","SCHWARTZ, LISA ","12/15/2016","11/30/2020","Acetylesterase; Address; Adult; Alleles; Animal Model; Apoptosis; Apoptotic; base; Birth; blastocyst; cancer cell; Cardiac; Cardiac Myocytes; cardiac regeneration; Cell Aging; Cell Cycle; Cell Cycle Arrest; Cell Cycle Inhibition; Cell Death; Cell Line; Cells; Cessation of life; Chromosomes; DNA; DNA Damage; Embryo; Event; Excision; Failure; gain of function; Heart; heart cell; Heart failure; Heart Hypertrophy; Homeostasis; Human; Hypoxia; In Vitro; in vivo; Induction of Apoptosis; Infarction; Ischemia; knock-down; Laboratories; Length; LoxP-flanked allele; Mediating; Mitotic; Molecular; Molecular Target; mouse model; Mus; Myocardial Infarction; Myocardial Ischemia; Myocardium; Natural regeneration; Neonatal; Organ; Pathway interactions; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phenotype; prevent; Process; Proliferating; Proteins; Publishing; recombinase; Recruitment Activity; repaired; Reporting; Research Personnel; response; Role; senescence; Staging; Stress; Tamoxifen; telomere; Telomere Capping; Testing; therapeutic target; Time; TP53 gene; Transgenes; Work; ","Tip60, Ischemic Heart Disease and Regeneration","131788","MIM","Myocardial Ischemia and Metabolism Study Section ","","A1","01","325614","175832","501446",""

This project will determine whether down-regulation of the DNA repair enzyme AP endonuclease 1 (APE1) in germinal centers, coupled with its substitution by APE2, is a major cause of mutations, and aims to develop a novel system to study SHM in vitro based on APE levels that mimic the GC.","1895337; ","SCHRADER, CAROL E;","FERGUSON, STACY E.","12/15/2016","11/30/2018","activation-induced cytidine deaminase; Antibodies; Antibody Affinity; Antibody Diversity; Antibody Response; B-Lymphocytes; base; Biology; Cell Culture Techniques; Cells; Chromosomal translocation; Co-Immunoprecipitations; Coupled; Cytosine; Data; deep sequencing; Defect; differential expression; DNA; DNA Polymerase beta; DNA Repair; DNA Repair Enzymes; DNA Repair Gene; DNA-(apurinic or apyrimidinic site) lyase; DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase; Down-Regulation; Embryonic Development; endonuclease; Engineering; Enzymes; Equilibrium; Exons; Frequencies; Genes; genome-wide; Genomic Instability; Germinal Center B-Lymphocyte; Homologous Gene; Human; Human Cell Line; Immune response; Immunoglobulin Class Switching; Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation; Immunoglobulin Variable Region; Immunoglobulins; Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes; In Vitro; in vivo; Induced Mutation; insight; Introns; Knock-in Mouse; Lead; Left; Lesion; LoxP-flanked allele; Lymphomagenesis; Mammals; Mass Spectrum Analysis; Mismatch Repair; Mus; mutant; Mutate; Mutation; Mutation Spectra; novel; Nucleotides; overexpression; Pathway interactions; Phase; Phosphodiesterase I; phosphoric diester hydrolase; Polymerase; Process; Proteins; Protocols documentation; Reading; Recombinants; Recruitment Activity; Regulation; repaired; research study; Single Strand Break Repair; Site; Spectrum Analysis; Spleen; Structure of germinal center of lymph node; Syndrome; System; Terminator Codon; Testing; Time; Transgenes; Transgenic Mice; transition mutation; transversion mutation; Uracil; uracil-DNA glycosylase; X Chromosome; XRCC1 gene; ","Regulation of Antibody Diversity by AP Endonucleases","126122","CMIB","Cellular and Molecular Immunology - B Study Section ","","A1","01","150000","101250","251250",""

This project will evaluate the risk of HF and HF-related complications among HIV-infected and carefully-matched HIV- uninfected adults from a large consortium of geographically diverse U.S. health systems in order to inform strategies to reduce the burden of HF in HIV-infected patients.","8399023; 8520402 (contact); ","GO, ALAN S; SILVERBERG, MICHAEL J (contact);","DESVIGNE-NICKENS, PATRICE ","12/15/2016","11/30/2020","Acute myocardial infarction; Address; Adherence; Adult; Adverse effects; Affect; Age; age related; Aging; aging population; AIDS/HIV problem; American; antiretroviral therapy; Attention; base; Blood Vessels; Cardiovascular Diseases; cardiovascular risk factor; Cardiovascular system; causal model; Cessation of life; Clinical; clinical risk; Communities; Comorbidity; Computerized Medical Record; Data; Developed Countries; Disease; EFRAC; Epidemiology; experience; Family health status; Future; General Population; Health system; Heart failure; High Prevalence; high risk; HIV; HIV Infections; Hospitalization; Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes; improved; improved outcome; Incidence; Individual; Inflammation; Knowledge; Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction; Longevity; Medical; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; multidisciplinary; Myocardial Infarction; Natural immunosuppression; Nucleosides; Outcome; outcome forecast; Patient risk; Patients; Persons; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Population; premature; Prevalence; Prevention; Prevention strategy; Primary Prevention; Protease Inhibitor; Quality of life; randomized trial; Recording of previous events; Registries; Reporting; Research; Resources; Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors; Risk; Risk Factors; Sample Size; Secondary Prevention; Severity of illness; Source; therapy adherence; Time; treatment strategy; Veterans; virtual; Virus Replication; Vulnerable Populations; ","HIV Status and Incidence and Outcomes of Heart Failure","132640","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","01","582321","167171","749492",""

There is evidence that bone micro-structure and bone marrow fat both play important roles in skeletal health of HIV-infected patients. The results from this study will allow us to better understand the association of marrow fat and bone quality in HIV. Thus, our findings will help to better understand biological mechanisms impacting elevated fracture risk in HIV. This will have an important positive impact on current treatment strategies and further drug development. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help to reduce the burdens of human disability.","8306892 (contact); 9076986; ","KAZAKIA, GALATEIA J (contact); KRUG, ROLAND ;","CHIOU, CHEN-CHIA (CHRISTINE) C.","12/15/2016","11/30/2021","adipocyte differentiation; Adipocytes; Affect; Age; Age-Related Bone Loss; aged; Aging; aging population; antiretroviral therapy; base; Biological; Biological Markers; Biomechanics; bone; bone cell; Bone Density; bone geometry; bone health; bone loss; Bone Marrow; bone quality; bone turnover; Cell Differentiation process; Cell Lineage; Competence; Control Groups; cost; Cross-Sectional Studies; Data; density; Deterioration; disability; Distal; drug development; Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry; Enrollment; Equilibrium; Etiology; experience; Fatty acid glycerol esters; Femur; Fracture; Functional disorder; Future; General Population; Health; Health Care Costs; High Prevalence; High Resolution Computed Tomography; Hip region structure; HIV; HIV Infections; HIV therapy; Human; Image; Imaging Techniques; immune activation; improved; in vivo; Incidence; Individual; Inflammation; innovation; Kidney; Knowledge; Life; Limb structure; lipid biosynthesis; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Marrow; Mechanics; men; Mission; Monitor; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; novel; novel strategies; Obesity; Osteoblasts; Osteoporosis; Pathway interactions; Patients; Peripheral; Play; Population; Property; Public Health; Qualifying; Race; Radial; Reporting; Research; Resolution; Risk; Risk Assessment; Role; Serum; sex; Signal Pathway; Site; skeletal; Societies; Stromal Cells; Structure; subcutaneous; Testing; Therapeutic; therapeutic target; tibia; Translating; treatment strategy; Vertebral column; Visceral; Woman; Work; X-Ray Computed Tomography; ","Bone quality and marrow adiposity in subjects with HIV","125080","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","01","457047","101738","558785",""

Leishmania are transmitted by a sand fly vector and cause a wide range of diseases, including visceral leishmaniasis (VL). It is estimated that VL causes over 50,000 deaths annually. Over 12 million people currently suffer from leishmaniasis in 98 countries, and more than 2 million are infected annually, making it a major global health problem and a neglected tropical disease. Leishmaniasis is increasingly seen in U.S. soldiers serving in Leishmania-endemic countries, such as Iraq and Afghanistan. Antimonials, amphotericin B, and miltefosine, the standard drugs used to treat leishmaniasis, are toxic. This leads to poor patient compliance and low-dose administration, ultimately contributing to the rise of strain-dependent drug resistance. There is a strong need for new nontoxic drugs with broad-spectrum activity against different species of Leishmania, a challenge that will be directly addressed by the work proposed here.","6867344 (contact); 6521834; ","IBBA, MICHAEL  (contact); SATOSKAR, ABHAY R;","O'NEIL, MICHAEL T","12/14/2016","11/30/2018","Active Sites; Address; Afghanistan; Algorithms; Amino Acids; Amino Acyl-tRNA Synthetases; Amphotericin B; Animal Model; Antifungal Agents; Antimalarials; base; Binding; Bioinformatics; Biological; Biological Assay; biological systems; Cell Culture Techniques; Cessation of life; Chemicals; chemotherapeutic agent; chemotherapy; combat; Combination Drug Therapy; Combined Modality Therapy; Communicable Diseases; comparative; comparative genomics; Compliance behavior; Computer Simulation; Country; Data; Developing Countries; Development; Disease; Dose; drug discovery; Drug resistance; drug sensitivity; Drug Targeting; Drug toxicity; Drug usage; efficacy evaluation; Enzymes; Evolution; Genome; genome annotation; global health; Goals; Growth; high throughput screening; Human; human morbidity; human mortality; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; Infection; inhibitor/antagonist; Intervention; Iraq; Killings; Lead; Leishmania; Leishmaniasis; Libraries; marine natural product; Miltefosine; Modeling; Molecular; Natural Products; neglected tropical diseases; novel; novel strategies; Orthologous Gene; Outcome; Output; Parasites; pathogen; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase; pre-clinical; Probability; Protein Biosynthesis; Proteins; Publishing; reconstitution; Refractory; Research; Resistance; resistance mechanism; resistant strain; Risk; Sand Flies; small molecule; Soldier; Specificity; Systems Biology; Testing; Toxic effect; Transfer RNA; Transfer RNA Aminoacylation; Trypanosoma; Validation; Variant; vector; Visceral Leishmaniasis; Work; ","A Systems Biology Approach for Targeted Drug Discovery for Leishmaniasis","127582","ZAI1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","135284","60144","195428",""

This program, which seeks to attract under- represented minorities, will result in an improved and more diverse pipeline of future scientists whose practical experience in clinical research will facilitate their entry into research careers.","8459868 (contact); 10440040; ","CHU, VIVIAN H (contact); THOMAS, KEVIN ;","MEADOWS, TAWANNA ","12/15/2016","11/30/2021","abstracting; Acceleration; Address; Affect; African American; Area; Arts; Attention; base; Cardiac; Cardiovascular Diseases; cardiovascular risk factor; Cardiovascular system; career; career development; Caring; Cause of Death; Child; Clinical; Clinical Research; college; Communication; Complement; congenital heart disorder; Databases; Drug Kinetics; Education; Educational Curriculum; Educational process of instructing; Educational workshop; Effectiveness; Enrollment; Ensure; Environment; ethnic diversity; experience; Faculty; faculty mentor; Fostering; Funding; Future; Genetic Markers; Goals; Grant; Health; health disparity; Health Professional; Health Sciences; Heart Diseases; Heart failure; high school; High School Student; Implantable Defibrillators; improved; Individual; Infective endocarditis; Interview; Investigation; knowledge base; Lead; Leadership; Learning; Medical; medical schools; Medical Students; member; Mentors; Mentorship; Methods; mid-career faculty; North Carolina; older patient; Online Systems; Participant; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Population Heterogeneity; Positioning Attribute; Prevention; Principal Investigator; programs; Public Health; public health relevance; racial disparity; racial diversity; Recruitment Activity; Research; research and development; Research Ethics; Research Infrastructure; Research Institute; Research Methodology; Resources; Review Literature; Running; Schools; Science; Scientist; skills; Solid; Structure; Students; success; summer research; symposium; tool; Training; Training Programs; Training Support; undergraduate student; Underrepresented Minority; Underrepresented Students; United States; United States National Institutes of Health; Universities; Vulnerable Populations; Work; Writing; ","Bridging the Gap to Enhance Clinical Research Program (BIGGER)","135304","ZHL1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","96962","480","97442",""

However, how viruses deal with the threat of host cell necroptosis has not been fully investigated. In this application, we will explore the molecular mechanisms of two classes of viral inhibitors of necroptosis and their impact on viral replication.

We have shown that these cells can be found in the pancreatic islets of human diabetic donors. In addition, we have also found that CD8 T cells infiltrate the exocrine tissue in high numbers. However, the specificity and function of these cells are not known. Based on our initial findings, we will systematically analyze CD8 T cells in these two areas of the pancreas (endocrine and exocrine) in samples obtained from donors with type 1 diabetes. [In addition, through the information contained in the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) and the expertise of our collaborators, we will discover new self-and viral epitopes that might play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease]. Additionally, we will evaluate the potential role of viruses in the development of T1D with special focus on enteroviruses and herpesviruses.

Therefore, novel therapies are urgently needed to inhibit the progression of atherosclerosis. However, the mechanisms underlying the suppression of atherosclerosis by soluble immune factors, called anti-inflammatory cytokines, remain poorly defined. The proposed studies will examine the contribution and mechanism of a new anti- inflammatory cytokine interleukin-35 (IL-35) pathway in atherosclerosis-accelerated vascular disease. Success of this study would characterize IL-35 suppressive molecular signaling in atherosclerosis and lead to the development of new therapeutics for the treatment of cardiovascular disease (MI), cerebrovascular disease (stroke), and peripheral vascular disease.","2106904; ","YANG, XIAO-FENG ;","CHEN, JUE ","12/12/2016","11/30/2020","Acceleration; Acetylation; Anti-inflammatory; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Aorta; Apolipoprotein E; apolipoprotein E-3; Arterial Fatty Streak; atherogenesis; Atherosclerosis; autoimmune arthritis; Autoimmune Diabetes; B-Lymphocytes; base; Blood Vessels; Calcium; Cardiovascular Diseases; cell type; Cerebrovascular Disorders; Coronary Arteriosclerosis; cytokine; Data; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; Disease; Endothelial Cells; expectation; feeding; Functional disorder; Future; Gene Activation; Gene Expression; Generations; Genes; Goals; High Fat Diet; Histones; Human; Human Herpesvirus 4; Hyperlipidemia; IL3 gene; Immune; Inflammation; Inflammatory; insight; Intercellular adhesion molecule 1; Interleukin-1; Interleukin-10; Interleukin-12; Interleukin-2; Interleukin-3; Interleukin-5; Interleukins; Knockout Mice; Lead; Ligands; Link; Lipids; Lipopolysaccharides; Lysine; Lysophosphatidylcholines; macrophage; Mediating; Mitochondria; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Modeling; Molecular; monocyte; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Mus; Myocardial Infarction; new therapeutic target; novel; novel therapeutics; Paper; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Patients; Peripheral arterial disease; Peripheral Vascular Diseases; Plasma; Process; Publications; Publishing; Reactive Oxygen Species; receptor; Regulatory T-Lymphocyte; Role; Signal Transduction; Smooth Muscle Myocytes; Staging; STAT1 gene; STAT3 gene; STAT4 gene; Stimulus; stroke; success; T-Lymphocyte; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Studies; Time; TLR4 gene; TNF gene; Transcription Factor AP-1; Transforming Growth Factor beta; Up-Regulation; Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1; Vascular Diseases; vascular inflammation; Vascular Smooth Muscle; ","IL-35 suppression of endothelial cell activation and atherosclerosis","132399","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","01","376728","210968","587696",""

Notably, antimicrobial resistance associated with food-borne pathogens has become a priority concern in public health. Food-borne pathogens can develop resistance to certain antibiotics via the exposure of antimicrobials primarily from excessive or incorrect use within agricultural practices leading to prorogation and circulation within our current food production system. These pathogens may also serve as reservoirs for antimicrobial genetic elements that may transfer to other pathogens. The growing trend of antibiotic resistance of food-borne pathogens continues to elevated concerns of food safety within the U.S. food system.  The main goal of this project will be the isolation and characterization of four different microorganisms for Salmonella, Campylobacter sp., E.coli and Enterococcus sp. from different retail meats. These isolates are subjected to downstream phenotypic and genotypic characterizations. The identity of these isolates will be confirmed before submission to the FDA for further characterization. In addition to pathogen isolation, the Laboratories Administration has the capability and capacity to use advanced technologies to further characterize these isolates including speciation, serotyping, and whole genome sequencing.","14514203; ","LAKSANALAMAI, PONGPAN ;","","09/01/2016","08/31/2021","","Enhancing Capability and Capacity of Maryland?s Laboratory to Conduct Surveillance of Antibiotic Resistance Pathogens in Selected Retail Foods","005786","ZFD1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","","","145540",""

Following screening and informed consent, veterans will be randomly assigned to treatment with repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) or sham rTMS (placebo). Additional examinations will compare brain imaging (structural and functional MRI scans at rest) across participants at baseline, after acute rTMS treatment, and at 6 month follow-up. The VA population differs significantly from populations that have been included in prior trials of rTMS for many conditions such as depression, chronic pain, and PTSD. Many returning OEF/OIF personnel and Veterans with concussion histories report cognitive problems, such as impaired attention, verbal fluency, poor planning, reduced working memory, and mental flexibility.

The gold standard for the detection and evaluation of AVMs is digital subtraction angiography (DSA) which is an invasive procedure involving X-ray and iodinated contrast agents. The goal of this project is to develop a noninvasive time-resolved dynamic MR angiography technique for the evaluation of AVMs. Once validated, this technique will reduce the use of DSA in AVM patients, thereby alleviating associated risks and stress.","7681546; ","WANG, DANNY JJ;","LIU, GUOYING ","12/14/2012","11/30/2017","Aftercare; Anatomy; Angiography; Architecture; Arteries; Arteriovenous malformation; base; Blood; Blood flow; blood flow measurement; Blood Vessels; Blood Volume; Bolus Infusion; Brain; brain tissue; Bypass; Cerebral Aneurysm; Cerebrovascular Disorders; Cessation of life; Clinical; contrast enhanced; contrast imaging; Contrast Media; Detection; Development; Diagnostic; Digital Subtraction Angiography; Disease; Evaluation; feeding; Goals; Gold; Health; hemodynamics; Hemorrhage; Image; Imagery; improved; Injury; Intracranial Hemorrhages; Ionizing radiation; Kinetics; Label; Lead; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; malformation; Measurement; Measures; Methods; Modeling; Neurologic; Patients; Perfusion; Phase; Physiologic pulse; Procedures; Radial; Reference Standards; research clinical testing; Resolution; Risk; Roentgen Rays; Sampling; Scanning; Scheme; Shunt Device; spatiotemporal; Speed; Spin Labels; Stress; Techniques; temporal measurement; Testing; Time; time use; Tracer; Validation; vascular abnormality; Veins; Venous; Water; Weight; ","Non-contrast 4-D Dynamic MRA in Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM)","014922","BMIT","Biomedical Imaging Technology Study Section ","","","05","118195","76827","195022",""

Fibroblasts invade the injury zone and through various processes actively impair cardiac function. Converting these fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes would be clinically beneficial, as it will restore the normal function of the heart. We have recently shown that a combination of microRNAs (miR combo) reprogrammed fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes and partially improved cardiac function following injury. In this application we will investigate ways to increase efficiency, cell specificity, and effectiveness of miR combo. To that end, we will study a self-complementary Adeno-associated virus that specifically target fibroblasts, the role of TLR3 in enhancing the efficiency of miR combo, and the mechanism by which miR combo induces reprogramming. The proposed studies will give important information and insight into how to better treat the deleterious consequences of myocardial injury.","1870733; ","DZAU, VICTOR J;","ADHIKARI, BISHOW B.","12/15/2016","11/30/2020","Address; Adult; Agonist; Area; base; Bioinformatics; Biological Assay; Cardiac; Cardiac Myocytes; cardiac regeneration; cardiac repair; Cardiovascular system; Cell Fate Control; Cells; Cicatrix; Clinical effectiveness; Data; Dependovirus; Echocardiography; Effectiveness; Fibroblasts; Fibrosis; Figs - dietary; functional improvement; functional restoration; Future; gain of function; Gene Expression; Genes; Genetic Transcription; Heart; heart function; Histology; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; induced pluripotent stem cell; Infection; inhibitor/antagonist; injured; Injury; insight; Invaded; Knockout Mice; loss of function; Luciferases; Mediating; Medicine; Messenger RNA; Methods; MicroRNAs; Motion; Myocardial; Myocardial Infarction; Natural Immunity; Natural regeneration; novel; novel strategies; Pathway interactions; Process; Recovery of Function; repaired; Reporting; response; Retroviridae; Role; Serotyping; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Specificity; Subfamily lentivirinae; Testing; Therapeutic; Tissues; TLR3 gene; transcription factor; Transcription Repressor/Corepressor; transdifferentiation; transduction efficiency; vector; Viral; Virus; ","Novel strategy for Enhancing miRNA as a Therapeutic for Cardiac Regeneration","131814","CCHF","Cardiac Contractility, Hypertrophy, and Failure Study Section ","","A1","01","250000","147500","397500",""

Clinically-representative patient- derived mouse models of the STS subtypes, that metastasize, similar to the patient, would offer potential for individualizing STS therapy and for discovery of more effective therapeutics. Our laboratory has shown that the site of transplantation of patient tumors in mice determine whether the tumor can replicate its behavior in the patient. Implanting a patient?s tumor subcutaneously, although a simple procedure, does not allow the tumor to metastasize. In contrast, transplanting the tumor ?orthotopically? (literally ?correct place?) enables the tumor to replicate the behavior in the patient. Our laboratory pioneered patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (literally ?outside graft? or grant from another species) (PDOX) mouse models and has been developing PDOX models of major cancer types for more than 25 years.1-12 PDOX models of colon cancer,1,13 pancreatic cancer,2 lung cancer,3 breast cancer,5 ovarian cancer,4 stomach cancer,6 cervical cancer11 and mesothelioma9 were previously established. In these models, the orthotopic transplantation site was determined and metastasis resulted that matched the donor patient.6,11 For the past year, we have focused on establishing a series of mouse models of soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) and have established a series of 25 patient derived STS that represent the most common histologic subtypes, including liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, myxofibrosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (sarcoma not otherwise specified (NOS). In addition we have established several of the more uncommon STS subtypes including follicular dendritic cell sarcoma, extra osseous Ewing?s soft-tissue sarcoma, and extra skeletal chondrosarcoma. The goal of the present application is to determine the correct orthotopic transplantation site for the STS types in order to obtain reliable primary tumor growth and both regional and distant metastasis similar to that seen in patients. These models will enable future personalized therapy of STS patients as well as discovery of more effective therapeutics of this recalcitrant disease.","6923166; ","HOFFMAN, ROBERT M;","EVANS, GREGORY ","12/15/2016","11/30/2017","abstracting; Anatomy; Behavior; cancer type; Cervical; chemotherapy; Chondrosarcoma; Clinical; clinically relevant; Collaborations; Collection; Colon Carcinoma; Disease; Disease Progression; Distant Metastasis; drug discovery; Follicular Dendritic Cell Sarcoma; Future; Goals; Grant; Histologic; Implant; International; Laboratories; Legal patent; leiomyosarcoma; Limb structure; liposarcoma; malignant breast neoplasm; Malignant neoplasm of lung; Malignant neoplasm of ovary; Malignant neoplasm of pancreas; Malignant Neoplasms; malignant stomach neoplasm; Modeling; mouse model; Mus; Muscle; Myxoid Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma; Names; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neoplasm Transplantation; novel therapeutics; Nude Mice; Operative Surgical Procedures; Outcome; Patient Representative; Patients; Peritoneum; personalized medicine; Phase; Primary Neoplasm; Procedures; programs; Recurrence; Research; response; Retroperitoneal Space; sarcoma; Series; Site; skeletal; Small Business Innovation Research Grant; Soft tissue sarcoma; Specific qualifier value; success; synovial sarcoma; Technology; Therapeutic; Thoracic cavity structure; Transplantation; tumor; tumor growth; Undifferentiated; Xenograft Model; Xenograft procedure; ","Establishment of a patient-like mouse models of soft-tissue sarcoma sub-types","213649","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","","","224700",""

Although prior research studies tell us that persons living with HIV at risk for TB can protect themselves for getting TB by taking the antibiotic isoniazid for 6 months, less than 1% of persons eligible receive this intervention. We found that the regional health managers responsible for the public health in their region are not knowledgeable about this intervention, have perceived concerns about putting it into operation and have challenges in overseeing their many clinics. This is an implementation research study where we study whether a multicomponent intervention (SPIRIT) that assists the District Health Officers can overcome these barriers. Testing an intervention that could improve worldwide delivery of isoniazid prevention for persons living with HIV in high TB burden countries could dramatically reduce global morbidity and mortality from TB.","1946812; ","HAVLIR, DIANE V;","HUEBNER, ROBIN E.","12/14/2016","11/30/2021","Accountability; Adherence; Adult; Affect; Africa; Africa South of the Sahara; Algorithms; Antibiotics; Attitude; authority; base; Behavior; behavioral construct; Behavioral Model; Belief; Calculi; Capital; Cause of Death; Cities; Clinic; Clinical; Cluster randomized trial; Communication; Consumption; Control Groups; cost; cost effectiveness; Costs and Benefits; Country; Data; Diffuse; Diffusion; Educational process of instructing; effectiveness measure; Eligibility Determination; Enabling Factors; Epidemic; Failure; Focus Groups; Gap Junctions; group intervention; Guidelines; Hair; Health; Health Information System; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Personnel; Health Promotion; Health Status; Health system; HIV; implementation research; improved; Incidence; Individual; interest; International; Internet; Intervention; isoniazid; Knowledge; Lead; Life; Link; Measures; Mediating; member; Methods; Modeling; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Motion; multi-component intervention; operation; Outcome; Patients; peer; Persons; Persuasive Communication; pill; Pilot Projects; Policies; Policy Maker; Population; population health; post intervention; Predisposing Factor; prevent; Prevention; Preventive therapy; primary outcome; Probability Samples; programs; Provider; Public Health; Randomized; Reinforcing Factor; Reporting; Research Infrastructure; research study; response; Risk; Sampling; scale up; secondary outcome; sharing data; social; Speed; Staging; standard of care; Sulfamethoxazole; Surveys; Symptoms; System; Testing; Text; theories; Time; Tuberculosis; Uganda; uptake; Use Effectiveness; Visit; Vitamin B6; Work; ","Simplified Isoniazid Preventive Therapy (SPIRIT) Strategy to Reduce TB Burden","125000","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","01","548800","175408","724208",""

I used induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from a patient with Reticular Dysgenesis to study this disease in a tissue culture dish and found that AK2 deficiency impairs hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell differentiation, which can be rescued by adding the antioxidant agent glutathione to the culture. In this proposal, I will investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying Reticular Dysgenesis and its responsiveness to antioxidants in iPSCs and a humanized mouse model of this disease to show that antioxidants have a therapeutic role in treating patients with Reticular Dysgenesis.","12320590; ","WEINACHT, KATJA GABRIELE;","GONDRE-LEWIS, TIMOTHY A.","04/14/2016","03/31/2021","adaptive immunity; Adenine Nucleotides; Adenosine Diphosphate; Adenosine Monophosphate; adenylate kinase; Advisory Committees; Affect; Aftercare; Antioxidants; Area; Award; Bacterial Infections; base; Biology; Boston; career; career development; Cause of Death; Cell Differentiation process; Cell Line; Cell model; Cell physiology; Cessation of life; Child; Clinical; clinical care; Complement; congenital immunodeficiency; Constitution; CRISPR/Cas technology; Dana-Farber Cancer Institute; Data; Defect; design; Development; Development Plans; Diagnosis; Disease; Disease model; Effectiveness; Engraftment; Ensure; Enzymes; experience; gene correction; Generations; Genes; Glutathione; Goals; Health; Hematological Disease; Hematology; Hematopoiesis; Hematopoietic; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; high risk; human disease; humanized mouse; Immune; Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes; Immunology; improved; In Situ; In Vitro; in vitro Model; in vivo; induced pluripotent stem cell; infancy; Institution; Lead; Life; Lymphopenia; Mediating; Mentors; Metabolic; Metabolism; Microbiology; Mitochondria; mitochondrial dysfunction; mitochondrial metabolism; Modeling; Molecular; mouse model; Mus; Mutate; Mutation; Mycoses; Myelogenous; Myeloid Cells; Natural Immunity; Nature; Neutropenia; neutrophil; novel strategies; oncology; Outcome; outcome forecast; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidative Stress; Pathogenesis; Pathology; Patients; Pediatric Hematologist; Pediatric Hematology; Pediatric Hospitals; Physicians; Play; Positioning Attribute; progenitor; reconstitution; Research; Research Personnel; Research Project Grants; Research Proposals; Research Training; reticular dysgenesis; Role; Scientist; Sensorineural Hearing Loss; Severe Combined Immunodeficiency; Specimen; Staging; stem; stem cell biology; stem cell differentiation; Stem cells; Structure; Supportive care; tandem mass spectrometry; targeted treatment; tenure track; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Human Experimentation; therapeutic target; Time; tissue culture; Training; Translating; Translational Research; Transplantation; Universities; Work; Xenograft Model; Xenograft procedure; Zebrafish; ","The role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of Reticular Dysgenesis and thetherapeutic potential of antioxidants","123571","AITC","Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation Research Committee ","","","02","45733","3659","49392",""

Her proposal involves a cognitive intervention enhanced with innovative technology to improve executive functioning following blast-related mild traumatic brain injury. The relevance of her proposed research to Veterans' health is of the utmost importance. Traumatic brain injury has been called the signature wound of the current wars and has affected over 287,861 Veterans to date. Effective treatments to restore these men and women to their greatest possible functional capacity are needed.

Research is needed on the best way to get rehabilitation-focused, sustained, evidence-based care to community-dwelling aging veterans and their families. Remote delivery of care via telehealth is one answer that ensures resources are available for those with diminished access to specialty health care resources due to disease burden or transportation barriers. This application describes two important contributions: 1) the manual development and an initial randomized controlled pilot study of a telephone-based counseling and care consultation intervention for veterans with dementia and their family caregivers; and 2) the training plan that will prepare Michelle Hilgeman, Ph.D., for a career devoted to developing and translating dyadic interventions that optimize recovery-focused outcomes for veterans with dementia and their caregivers.","10728976; ","HILGEMAN, MICHELLE M.;","","11/01/2015","10/31/2020","Address; Advisory Committees; Affect; Age; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease; Anxiety; Area; Award; base; Behavior; behavioral health; behavioral impairment; Behavioral Symptoms; burden of illness; care delivery; care seeking; career; career development; Caregiver Burden; caregiver depression; Caregivers; caregiving; Caring; Clinical; Communication; Communities; Comorbidity; comparison group; Complex; Consultations; coping; Counseling; Data; Deglutition; Dementia; dementia care; depressive symptoms; Development; Diagnosis; Disease; Distress; Doctor of Philosophy; effective intervention; Effectiveness; efficacy testing; Elderly; Elements; Emotional; Emotional Stress; empowered; Ensure; evidence base; Evidence based intervention; Exercise Therapy; experience; Family; Family Caregiver; family support; Feeling; flexibility; Foundations; functional disability; functional outcomes; Funding; Future; Goals; Grief reaction; group intervention; health administration; Healthcare; Home environment; improved; improved functioning; Individual; Intervention; Judgment; Knowledge; Lead; Long-Term Care; Manuals; Measures; medical specialties; Memory; Mental Health; Mental Health Services; Mentors; Methods; Modeling; Morbidity - disease rate; Nursing Homes; Outcome; Pain; patient oriented; Patients; Pattern; Personality; Persons; Pilot Projects; Population; psychoeducation; psychologic; Psychotherapy; public health relevance; Quality of life; Randomized; Randomized Controlled Trials; Recommendation; Recording of previous events; Recovery; Recruitment Activity; Rehabilitation therapy; Reporting; Research; Resources; Risk; Role; Safety; service utilization; Services; skills; Social support; Symptoms; systematic review; telehealth; Telephone; Training; Translating; Transportation; Travel; treatment response; Update; Veterans; Vietnam; Walking; Work; ","Optimizing Dementia Care Through Collaborative Recovery Interventions","001824","RRD9","Career Development Program - Panel II ","","","02","","","",""

In this proposal we plan to investigate how the eye's sensitivity to temporal changes in color and luminance contrast affects emmetropization.

Alto NARRATIVE The outbreak of Zika virus in Latin America, the presence of the virus in the US in patients returning from outbreak regions, and the potential for an outbreak of Zika in the United States, together with the possibility that Zika disrupts the normal development of babies in utero, has motivated President Obama to allocate an additional $1.8 billion to research and development to manage public health concerns. The premise of this research is that a low-cost, multipurpose kit that allows public health officials to identify Zika in trapped mosquitoes will help in that management, a premise that is not disputed in the public health community. The impact of these kits will be still greater if it is set up to, in the next phase of research, transition into a low-cost kits that can detect Zika virus in saliva and urine at points of sampling in low resource environments. This R21 research program will have further impact by familiarizing the community with the potential of synthetic biology to address public health concerns and, we hope, to move federal activities related to infectious disease from a 'disease of the month' response model (SARS, chikungunya, Valley fever, Ebola, MERS, dengue, and now Zika), where each new outbreak and news cycle creates a crisis, entirely unnecessary if synthetic biology innovations were to be moved into public health management, where a single technology platform gives public health officials a kit that has routine use, but also is flexible enough to accommodate new and exotic pathogens as they emerge.","9800100; 6299669 (contact); 12675975; ","ALTO, BARRY WILMER; BENNER, STEVEN A (contact); GLUSHAKOVA, LYUDMYLA ;","REPIK, PATRICIA M.","12/15/2016","11/30/2018","Address; Adopted; Age; American; Appearance; Arboviruses; base; Benchmarking; Bioinformatics; Biological; Biological Assay; Brazil; Caring; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.); chikungunya; Clinic; Collaborations; Commercial Sectors; Communicable Diseases; Communities; Complex; Conservatism; Coronavirus; cost; Culicidae; Dengue; desert fever; design; Developing Countries; Development; Diagnostic; Disease; Disease Outbreaks; Disputes; DNA; Ebola virus; Economics; Emerging Communicable Diseases; Encephalitis; Environment; Evolution; Extramural Research Program; FDA approved; field study; flexibility; Florida; Future; Generations; Genetic Fingerprintings; genetic information; Genomics; Geography; Goals; hazard; Health Personnel; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis C; HIV; Human; Human Development; in utero; Individual; Infection; Information Systems; innovation; instrument; Laboratories; Latin America; Learning; Life; Liquid substance; Literature; man; medical attention; Medical Entomology; meetings; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus; Modeling; Molecular; molecular recognition; Monitor; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease; new technology; news; Noise; Nucleic Acids; Nucleotides; Outcome; Paper; pathogen; Patients; Phase; Population Surveillance; Preparation; Procedures; programs; Public Health; Public Sector; Reagent; Research; research and development; Research Personnel; Resources; response; RNA; RNA Viruses; Sales; Saliva; Sampling; Science; Sentinel; Sequence Analysis; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Signal Transduction; Small Business Technology Transfer Research; Staging; Sterilization; success; Surveys; Symptoms; synthetic biology; System; Technology; Testing; Time; tool; Translating; United States; United States Public Health Service; Universities; Urine; Viral Load result; viral RNA; Virus; West Nile virus; Work; Writing; Zika Virus; ","Meeting Urgent Needs in Surveillance and Diagnostics.

New drugs, that work in new ways to stop the growth of the parasite, are urgently needed, and we have identified the prototype of such a drug. To advance malaria therapy we propose to use the techniques of structural biology to determine how this prototype molecule inhibits a key enzyme in the malaria parasite. With this knowledge in hand we will use modern medicinal chemistry techniques to create more potent antimalarial agents, the most effective of which will be evaluated in vivo in mice.","8874498; ","CARLIER, PAUL R;","O'NEIL, MICHAEL T","12/16/2016","11/30/2018","5 year old; Anabolism; analog; Antimalarials; artemisinine; Artemisinins; base; Binding Sites; Biochemical Pathway; Biological Assay; Blood; Cells; Cessation of life; Characteristics; Chemoprotection; chemotherapeutic agent; chemotherapy; Child; Chloroquine; Clinical; Collection; Computer Simulation; counterscreen; cytotoxicity; Data; design; Development; Disease; Dose; Dose-Limiting; Drug Design; Drug Kinetics; Drug resistance; efficacy testing; Ensure; Enzymes; Escherichia coli; Evaluation; fosmidomycin; Funding; Goals; Growth; Hand; Human; Image; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; Infection; inhibitor/antagonist; inorganic phosphate; Investigational Drugs; isoprenoid; Killings; Knowledge; knowledge base; Libraries; Ligands; Link; Malaria; malaria infection; Measurement; Measures; Medical; meetings; Methods; mevalonate; Modality; mortality; mouse model; Mus; novel therapeutics; Oral; Parasites; pathogen; Pathway interactions; Pharmaceutical Chemistry; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase; Plasmodium; Plasmodium berghei; Plasmodium falciparum; Population; Positioning Attribute; pre-clinical; Pregnant Women; prevent; Property; prototype; Reporting; Resistance; resistant strain; Resolution; response; Roentgen Rays; Safety; scaffold; screening; Specificity; Staging; structural biology; Structure; Techniques; Testing; Therapeutic; Toxic effect; transmission process; Triage; virtual; Walkers; Work; ","Structure- and ligand-based design of new IspD-targeting antimalarials","128362","ZAI1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","155000","90526","245526",""

Based on our preliminary data, certain drug interactions appear to increase the chance of pregnancy while using hormonal contraceptives. To address this, our proposed study will evaluate practical strategies for the use of a levonorgestrel contraceptive implant, which is the most widely available hormone implant in low and middle-income countries, in HIV-infected women. Thus, our results will guide co-management of these important medications, and are thereby expected to reduce unintended pregnancies, improve maternal and child mortality, and decrease the rate of mother-to-child HIV transmission.","8934738; ","SCARSI, KIMBERLY K;","KAUFMAN, STEVEN ","12/01/2015","11/30/2020","Address; Adult; Adverse event; Affect; Africa South of the Sahara; antiretroviral therapy; Area; Atazanavir; base; Caring; Cessation of life; Child Mortality; Clinical Research; Contraceptive Agents; contraceptive efficacy; Contraceptive methods; Control Groups; Country; Data; dosage; Dose; Drug Interactions; Drug Kinetics; efavirenz; Ensure; evidence base; Excision; Failure; Family Planning; Female of child bearing age; Fertility; Funding; Future; Goals; Health; HIV; hormonal contraception; Hormones; Implant; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; Individual; individualized prevention; Infant; Injectable; Levonorgestrel; Life; low and middle-income countries; Marketing; Maternal Mortality; Methods; Modeling; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Mother-to-child HIV transmission; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development; Newborn Infant; novel; Oral Contraceptives; Pharmaceutical Preparations; pill; Plasma; Pregnancy; prevent; Prevention; Progestins; Public Health; Regimen; Reporting; Reproductive Health; Research; Research Design; Research Personnel; Research Priority; Resources; Risk; Ritonavir; Safety; Sampling; Science; Therapeutic; transmission process; Uganda; unintended pregnancy; United States National Institutes of Health; virtual; Woman; Women's Group; Women's Health; Work; World Health Organization; ","Pharmacological Strategies to use the Levonorgestrel Implant in HIV-infected Women","085887","ACE","AIDS Clinical Studies and Epidemiology Study Section ","","","02","206899","33590","240489",""

The overarching goal of this research is to enhance our understanding of the genes and regulatory mechanisms that mediate myometrial quiescence and contractility during pregnancy and labor, and their dysregulation leading to preterm birth. In the proposed research, we will use mouse models and human myometrial cells and tissues to address the central role of the progesterone receptor (PR) and differential functions of its isoforms (PR-A vs. PR-B) in the maintenance of pregnancy and initiation of labor. Next generation sequencing of RNA (RNA-seq) combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation-deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) will be used to identify novel myometrial genes and pathways that can ultimately serve as therapeutic targets to prevent preterm birth and its consequences.","1857674; ","MENDELSON, CAROLE R.;","","","","Address; Aftercare; Anti-inflammatory; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; base; Binding; Biology; Birth; C-Terminal Binding Protein 1; Cells; Characteristics; chromatin immunoprecipitation; chromatin modification; Chromatin Structure; Collagen; Complex; Connexin 43; deep sequencing; DNA Binding Domain; DNA Polymerase II; Enzymes; Epigenetic Process; epigenetic regulation; Estradiol; Euchromatin; Family; Family member; gene discovery; Gene Expression; gene induction; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Transcription; Genomics; Goals; Heterochromatin; Histone H3; histone modification; hormone regulation; Hormones; Human; IL8 gene; Immunoblotting; Immunoprecipitation; Infant Mortality; Inflammatory; insight; knock-down; Knockout Mice; Life; Lipopolysaccharides; Mass Spectrum Analysis; Mediating; member; Metabolism; MicroRNAs; Mifepristone; Molecular; mouse model; Mus; Myometrial; myometrium; next generation sequencing; NF-kappa B; novel; overexpression; p65; Pathway interactions; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Maintenance; pregnant; Premature Birth; Premature Labor; prevent; Progesterone; progesterone receptor A; progesterone receptor B; Progesterone Receptors; promoter; Protein Isoforms; Proteins; PTGS2 gene; receptor function; Recruitment Activity; Regulation; Regulator Genes; Reporting; Research; Response Elements; RNA; Role; therapeutic target; Time; Tissues; transcription factor; Transcription Factor AP-1; Transcription Repressor/Corepressor; transcriptome; transcriptome sequencing; Up-Regulation; Woman; ","Epigenetic Regulation of Myometrial Contractility in Pregnancy and Labor","087150","ZHD1","Special Emphasis Panel ","5543","A1","01","166000","102920","","268920"

As weight cycling is widely experienced by individuals across all weight categories attempting weight loss, this timely proposal will address one of the top priorities in public health issues. This proposal, which incorporates a life course perspective and explores heterogeneity by methods used to lose weight and by adiposity trajectories, will contribute to elaborating weight control guidelines to prevent cancer incidence and mortality by informing on the optimal timing of intervention, demonstrating the value of incorporating exercise in weight loss regime, and suggesting weight cycling as a novel risk factor for normal weight individuals generally considered at lower risks for cancer endpoints.

Over-exuberant T cell function leads to debilitating and fatal inflammatory disease. Activated T cells have to grow, exit quiescence, proliferate and differentiate in order to function. Using cutting-edge protein-based functional omics analysis and innovative genetic approaches, the proposed study aims to reveal previously uncharacterized protein-expression networks controlling activation- induced T cell growth, quiescence exit, proliferation and differentiation, to shed new lights on how protein and mRNA expression correlate during T cell function, and to discover novel mechanisms underlying the function of critical T cell regulators. The success of this study will, for the first time, provide an atlas for the protein networks underlying T cell function. It will establish a molecular map for the normal function of activated T cells. It will identify new factors and pathways controlling specific T cell functions. It will aid our effectors to reveal the deregulated factors in T cells in immune diseases including cancer, SCID, inflammation and autoimmunity, and the efforts to discover the bio-markers for diseases and to devise strategies and find drug targets to treat diseases.","8617148; ","WAN, YISONG ;","RAMACHANDRA, LAKSHMI ","12/12/2016","11/30/2021","Address; Atlases; Autoimmunity; base; Biological; Biological Markers; Biomass; Cell Differentiation process; cell growth; Cell physiology; Cell Proliferation; cell type; Cellular biology; Critical Pathways; differential expression; Disease; disease diagnosis; Drug Targeting; Effector Cell; Etiology; Event; Genes; Genetic; genetic approach; genome editing; genome-wide; Genomics; Goals; Growth; Health; Immune System Diseases; Inflammation; Inflammatory; innovation; Knowledge; Lymph; Malignant Neoplasms; Maps; Messenger RNA; Methods; Molecular; Molecular Target; mouse model; mRNA Expression; novel; outcome forecast; Pathway interactions; Post-Translational Protein Processing; Proliferating; Protein Analysis; protein expression; protein function; Proteins; Proteomics; Research; Resolution; Role; Sampling; Speed; Staging; success; System; T cell differentiation; T-Lymphocyte; Technology; Time; ","Functional protein networks underlying T cell growth, proliferation and differentiation","123193","CMIB","Cellular and Molecular Immunology - B Study Section ","","A1","01","250000","127975","377975",""

In 2015, an estimated 5.4 million Americans had Alzheimer's disease (AD), which accounts for 70 percent of all cases of dementia. The formation of misfolded protein oligomers in neurons is an early and causative event in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. Current therapeutics against AD (e.g., AChE inhibitors and memantine) only temporarily slows the rate of cognitive decline without affecting the disease process or addressing the oligomeric forms of ?-amyloid (A?) and oligomeric tau in AD pathogenesis. NeuroEM has been developing and testing a new non-pharmacologic intervention against AD, Transcranial Electromagnetic Treatment (TEMT), which disaggregates A? oligomers. This grant application will determine the anti-oligomerization effects of TEMT on three toxic oligomers (A?, tau, and ?-synuclein), optimize TEMT treatment parameters, and investigate TEMT?s direct mechanism(s) of action ? all of which are important for refining TEMT technology as NeuroEM moves into clinical trials with this promising neuromodulatory technology.","1921257; ","ARENDASH, GARY W;","FERTIG, STEPHANIE ","12/15/2016","11/30/2017","abeta oligomer; Accounting; Address; Affect; Age-Years; alpha synuclein; Alzheimer's Disease; American; Amyloid; Amyloid beta-Protein; Applications Grants; Area; beta pleated sheet; Biological Assay; Brain; brain parenchyma; Cell Culture Techniques; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials; Cognition; Cognitive deficits; commercialization; Coupling; Dementia; Devices; dielectric property; Disease; Down Syndrome; Electromagnetics; Event; Failure; follow-up; Foundations; Frequencies; Functional disorder; Funding; Gel; Glass; Goals; Head; Human; Hydrogen Bonding; Impaired cognition; In Vitro; in vivo; indexing; Individual; inhibitor/antagonist; Innovative Therapy; insight; Intervention; Investments; Letters; Manikins; Measures; Memantine; Memory Loss; monomer; Neurodegenerative Disorders; Neurons; neuroregulation; Paper; Parkinson Disease; Pathogenesis; Pathologic; Patients; Peer Review; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase; Phase II Clinical Trials; prevent; Prevention; Problem Solving; Process; protein misfolding; protein oligomer; Proteins; prototype; Sampling; Small Business Innovation Research Grant; tau aggregation; tau Proteins; Tauopathies; Technology; Temporal Lobe; Testing; Therapeutic; Transgenic Mice; Traumatic Brain Injury; treatment effect; Validation; Work; ","Disaggregation of Toxic Protein Oligomers in Brain with Electromagnetic Treatment","090653","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","01","","","255391",""

Many affected veterans have problems with thinking and memory and brain scans have shown abnormal brain structure. The cause of GWVI is not known but it may be related to exposure to environmental toxins. GW veterans may also be at increased risk for progressive brain problems such as Alzheimer's disease due to accelerated brain aging and long-term effects of brain injuries. Scientists in the field agree that more studies using human brain tissue obtained after death are vital to accelerate research on GWVI. To meet this critical need we are establishing a Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses Biorepository (GWVIB) as an essential resource to support research on the causes of GW illness and the development of effective treatments for those affected by this debilitating illness.","1886166 (contact); 10363201; ","KOWALL, NEIL W.

However, the gain in nearly 30 years of life expectancy over the last century in the United States and other developed countries, driven in part by reductions in mortality among the elderly, has resulted in changes in disease prevalence that cannot be accounted for by alterations in allele frequency during the same period. This suggests the need to better understand how genes are influenced by the environment without changing the DNA sequence (epigenetics). To increase our knowledge of the biological determinants of the aging process and ultimately to contribute to the design of targeted public health interventions, a study of locus-specific DNA methylation in blood will be carried out in the biracial Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study to test the hypothesis that methylation signatures established in middle age are associated with the overall construct of successful aging (i.e., physical, cognitive, and functional well-being) assessed over 20 years later, and that the midlife successful aging pattern of methylation persists in those that successfully age.","1876484; ","BOERWINKLE, ERIC A.;","WRIGHT, JACQUELINE ","12/15/2016","11/30/2020","abstracting; Accounting; Adult; Affect; Age; aged; Aging; Aging-Related Process; Ancillary Study; Atherosclerosis; Biological; Biological Aging; Biological Markers; biracial; Blood; Cardiovascular Diseases; case control; Chronic Disease; Clinical; Cognitive; Cohort Studies; Communities; Custom; Data; database of Genotypes and Phenotypes; design; Developed Countries; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; Disease; disorder risk; DNA Methylation; DNA Modification Process; DNA Sequence; Elderly; Environment; Epigenetic Process; Gender; Gene Expression; Gene Frequency; Genes; genome wide association study; genome-wide; Goals; Health; Healthcare; Incidence; Individual; Inherited; insight; Knowledge; Laboratory Study; Lead; Life; Life Expectancy; Life Style; Longevity; Measurement; Measures; meetings; Methylation; methylation pattern; middle age; modifiable risk; mortality; novel marker; novel therapeutics; Participant; Patient Self-Report; Pattern; Personal Satisfaction; pleiotropism; Population; pressure; Prevalence; public health intervention; Quality of life; Race; Research; Retirement; Risk; Risk Factors; Role; Testing; Therapeutic Agents; Time; United States; Variant; Variation (Genetics); Visit; ","Epigenetics of Successful Aging","131136","CHSA","Cancer, Heart, and Sleep Epidemiology A Study Section ","","A1","01","523166","167776","690942",""

Few treatment options are available to alleviate effects of the free radical-induce damage to brain. One recently discovered possibility is treatment by antioxidant enzymes or their artificial mimetics, which can serve as highly efficient free radical scavengers at the site f injury. However, these agents alone are unable to reach the site of injury because brain is separated from the blood stream by the blood-brain barrier. The goal of this project is to improve delivery of highly reactive antioxidant AEOL 10150 to central nervous system. If successful, this research can lead to considerable improvement of stroke outcomes and therefore enhance long-term quality of life for the stroke survivors. Here, we propose to test this approach using a mouse stroke model.

Based on studies of underlying mechanisms, we propose to improve the heart function of patients with this mitral condition caused by heart attack by treating the heart muscle as well as the valve, and by treating both the contracting heart cells and their surrounding scar-forming cells together in way that may produce the greatest benefit, especially providing early treatment following heart attack to prevent the vicious downhill cycle to heart failure in a large number of patients.

To address this question, we will take advantage of recent studies that have shown that rate and character of amyloid deposition in vulnerable transgenic mice can be greatly influenced by injecting homogenates from human brain into these mouse brains, a technique termed seeding. We propose to seed the brains of two distinct lines of transgenic mice that develop amyloid pathology late in life with homogenates from AD and PA brains, and then assess whether pathology induced in these animals causes cognitive impairment.","1868851 (contact); 1875997; ","BORCHELT, DAVID R (contact); LEWIS, JADA M;","YANG, AUSTIN JYAN-YU","12/15/2016","11/30/2018","abeta deposition; Acceleration; Address; aged; Aging; aging brain; Alzheimer's Disease; Amyloid; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Amyloid deposition; amyloid formation; amyloid pathology; Amyloidosis; Animals; base; behavior test; Benign; beta amyloid pathology; Biological Models; Brain; cerebral amyloidosis; Cessation of life; Characteristics; Cognition; Cognitive; Cognitive deficits; cognitive function; conditioned fear; conformer; Data; Deposition; Exhibits; Functional disorder; Human; Impaired cognition; in vivo; Individual; Life; Mediator of activation protein; Molecular Conformation; mouse model; Mouse Strains; Mus; Nature; Neurobehavioral Manifestations; non-demented; parallel processing; Pathologic; pathological aging; Pathology; Play; Positioning Attribute; Prions; Research; Role; Seeds; Structure; Tauopathies; Techniques; Testing; Therapeutic; Time; Transgenic Mice; Transgenic Organisms; ","Is there a form of benign brain amyloidosis in aging?","055113","CDIN","Cell Death in Neurodegeneration Study Section ","","","01","125000","65625","190625",""

We will vary the design of the orthoses and subjects will be examined to find out which are most effective at improving function. It has recently been shown that veterans have a significantly higher prevalence of foot problems, including arthritis and flatfoot, than non-veterans. In 2010, there were 308 million Americans, of which 21.8 million were veterans, including 9 million who were 65 or older. Demographically, most foot problems are more prevalent in older populations. The prevalence of diabetes is also higher in older populations. Therefore, veterans, in particular older veterans, are likely to suffer from foot problems such as arthritis, flatfoot or diabetes related tissue changes, at a higher prevalence than the general population, and as such, they stand to benefit from the research that our group is proposing.","8428824; ","LEDOUX, WILLIAM R.;","","12/01/2015","11/30/2019","Address; Adult; Affect; Algorithms; American; Ankle; Arthritis; Articular Range of Motion; Automobile Driving; base; Biomechanics; bone; bone geometry; Clinical; clinical decision-making; clinically relevant; Custom; Data; Degenerative polyarthritis; design; Devices; Diabetes Mellitus; Disease Progression; Dose; experience; Female; Flatfoot; Fluoroscopy; foot; foot bone; Foot Deformities; General Population; Guidelines; High Prevalence; improved; improved functioning; Individual; individual patient; Influentials; Injury; innovation; insight; Intervention; joint loading; joint mobilization; Joints; kinematics; Kinetics; Lead; Ligaments; Location; Lower Extremity; Manuals; Measurement; Measures; Medical pins; Methods; Modeling; Morphologic artifacts; Motion; Movement; Muscle; muscle strength; Musculoskeletal; Older Population; Operative Surgical Procedures; Orthotic Devices; orthotics; Outcome; Pain; Participant; patient population; Patients; Performance; Population; Positioning Attribute; Posterior Tibial Tendon Dysfunction; Posture; predicting response; prescription procedure; pressure; Prevalence; Process; public health relevance; Randomized Controlled Trials; Recommendation; Regression Analysis; Research; Research Project Grants; response; Roentgen Rays; Shapes; Shoes; Skin; soft tissue; stem; Structure; Surface; System; Tarsal Bones; Techniques; Tissues; Translations; treatment strategy; Variant; Veterans; Work; Writing; ","Quantitative Prescription of Foot Orthoses: A Dose-Response Study of Kinematics in Patients with Foot and Ankle Pain using Biplane Fluoroscopy","002008","RRD2","Musculoskeletal/Orthopedic Rehabilitation  ","","","02","","","",""

Markers that predict vision loss in IIH have been elusive and this leads to uncertainty on the part of treating physicians regarding initiation and escalation of therapy. This work will aim to establish objective, non-invasive markers of IIH that improve diagnosis, facilitate monitoring and inform treatment decisions. The career development goals of the principal investigator include developing expertise in use of functional and structural measures of the visual pathways for study of IIH. The results will help treating physicians to improve clinical care of patients with IH.","11274245; ","MOSS, HEATHER ELSPETH;","AGARWAL, NEERAJ ","12/01/2016","03/31/2019","Affect; Aftercare; Age; Analysis of Variance; Area; Award; base; Biological Markers; Blindness; Blood Pressure; Blood Vessels; Brain; Caliber; career; career development; Caring; Cell physiology; Cerebrovascular Disorders; Clinical; clinical care; clinical epidemiology; Clinical Management; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials; Control Groups; Development; Diagnosis; Disease; Disease Outcome; Electrophysiology (science); Ensure; Environment; Equation; experience; Eye; Foundations; Functional disorder; Glaucoma; Goals; Health; Height; hypertension treatment; Image; Impairment; improved; Incidence; Injury; Institution; interest; Intracranial Hypertension; Intracranial Pressure; K-Series Research Career Programs; Knowledge; Lasers; Leadership; Light; Measures; Mechanics; medical schools; Mentors; Mentorship; Modeling; Monitor; Morbidity - disease rate; Nerve; Neurology; non-invasive imaging; Obesity; ophthalmic artery; Ophthalmologist; Ophthalmology; Optic Disk; Optic Nerve; optic nerve disorder; Optical Coherence Tomography; Outcome; Outcome Measure; Papilledema; patient oriented; Patients; Perimetry; Peripheral; Physicians; Physiological; Physiology; Pilot Projects; Plant Roots; Population; pressure; Principal Investigator; Productivity; programs; Pseudotumor Cerebri; Pupil; Recruitment Activity; Request for Applications; Research; Research Personnel; Research Project Grants; response; retina blood vessel structure; Retinal; Retinal Ganglion Cells; retinal nerve fiber layer; Risk; Scanning; Scientific Advances and Accomplishments; Scientist; Spinal Puncture; Spinal Tap; Structure; success; Swelling; Techniques; Testing; Therapeutic; Thick; Time; tool; Training; Translational Research; Uncertainty; Veins; Vision; Vision research; vision science; Visual; visual information; Visual Pathways; Visual Psychophysics; Work; young woman; ","Physiologically Based Markers of Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension","024345","ZEY1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","04","137188","10975","148163",""

Activation of T cells play a major role in the development and progression of the inflammatory response in donor hearts, an effect that is less pronounced with increasing age. We have identified novel factors, KLF10 and a microRNA, miR-340, that are inversely associated with increasing age in T cells and our studies indicate that KLF10 is protective in suppressing T cell responses after cardiac transplantation in older recipients. The proposed studies will provide a detailed understanding underlying the role of KLF10 in regulating T cell responses with the goal of developing therapies for the treatment of transplantation arteriosclerosis to improve graft survival.","6710361; ","FEINBERG, MARK W;","KIRBY, RUTH ","12/15/2016","11/30/2020","Acute; Age; age related; Aging; allograft rejection; Allografting; Anti-inflammatory; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Arterial Disorder; Arteriosclerosis; Atherosclerosis; base; Biological Assay; Biology of Aging; Cardiovascular system; CCL2 gene; CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes; Cell Differentiation process; cell growth; Cell physiology; Cell Transplants; Cells; Cellular biology; Cessation of life; Chemotaxis; Chronic; Coronary artery; crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing; Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated Protein 4; Deletion Mutation; Development; Diffuse; Disease; Epidemiologic Studies; Equilibrium; Event; Exhibits; Family; Family member; Foundations; Gene Expression; Gene Targeting; Goals; graft failure; Graft Survival; Heart; heart allograft; Heart Transplantation; Histocompatibility Antigens Class II; Human; Immunosuppressive Agents; improved; in vivo; Infiltration; Inflammation; Inflammation Mediators; Inflammatory; inflammatory marker; Inflammatory Response; insight; Interferon Type II; Interleukin-6; Knockout Mice; Kruppel-like transcription factors; Lesion; Leukocytes; Link; macrophage; Mediating; member; MicroRNAs; Mitogens; Molecular; Mus; Natural immunosuppression; novel; novel therapeutics; older patient; overexpression; Pathway interactions; Play; Process; Regulation; Regulatory T-Lymphocyte; Reporter Genes; response; Role; Series; Signal Transduction; Smooth Muscle Myocytes; Stimulus; T cell response; T-Cell Activation; T-Lymphocyte; T-Lymphocyte Subsets; Therapeutic; therapy development; TNF gene; transcriptome sequencing; Transplantation; ","KLF10, CD4+ T cells, and transplant arteriopathy","134849","AICS","Atherosclerosis and Inflammation of the Cardiovascular System Study Section ","","","01","250000","170500","420500",""

Finding evidence of unique genetic variants in ME/CFS and/or FM vs. other disorders would greatly enhance diagnosis and efforts to identify causes of these disorders.

Adult stem cells including autologous cardiac progenitor cells (CPC) are currently being used in clinical trials to enhance repair and regeneration of the disease heart. Initial results show safety of the CPC based therapy but modest gains in heart function of patients treated with stem cells. A number of reasons combine to limit the full benefits of such therapies including poor survival of transplanted cells, patient age and onset disease in the pathological heart meriting the need for development of alternate strategies to enhance CPC therapy. Most importantly, our results provide a new way to enhance efficacy of CPC therapy that may significantly improve the benefits of an existing cellular therapy and improve the lives of over 16 million patients in the United States living with coronary heart disease.","11305718; ","KHAN, MOHSIN ;","SCHWARTZ, LISA ","12/15/2016","11/30/2021","Address; Adult; adult stem cell; Age; Age of Onset; American; Autologous; base; Bioenergetics; burden of illness; Cardiac; Cardiac Myocytes; cardiac repair; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cell Cycle Progression; cell growth; Cell Therapy; Cell Transplants; Cells; Cicatrix; Clinic; Clinical; Clinical Trials; Coronary heart disease; Data; design; Development; Disease; Diving; Embryo; exosome; fetal; Fetal Heart; Goals; Growth; Harvest; Heart; Heart Diseases; Heart failure; heart function; Human; improved; Injury; Kinetics; Life; Link; loss of function; Maintenance; Mediating; MicroRNAs; Modeling; Modification; Morbidity - disease rate; Morphology; mortality; Muscle Cells; Myocardial; myocardial damage; Myocardial Infarction; Myocardial Ischemia; Natural regeneration; Neonatal; novel; older patient; Pathologic; Pathology; Patients; Performance; Prevalence; Process; Property; Publishing; Pump; Regenerative Medicine; Regenerative response; Regulation; repaired; Research; response; Rest; Role; Safety; Signal Transduction; Site; Staging; Stem cells; Structure; Testing; Therapeutic; tissue repair; Tissues; Treatment Efficacy; United States; ","Enhancement of Cardiac Cell therapy by reintroduction of developmental signaling","135117","MIM","Myocardial Ischemia and Metabolism Study Section ","","","01","250000","140000","390000",""

Narrative  The persistence of viral genomes after acute viral infections can lead to the development of chronic diseases, including post-viral asthma, encephalitis, and cardiac disease.

In this proposal, we will build upon our discoveries in mouse models of how to effectively kill residual cancer cells by conducting a new kind of clinical trial aimed at targeting and eliminating these cells, coupled with the development of an improved testing approach to identify those women who have DTCs. This innovative approach has the potential to prevent breast cancer recurrence and improve survival by providing the tools needed to enable breast cancer patients to be actively monitored as well as the evidence to destroy these cells before they become deadly metastases.","1882180 (contact); 1857505; ","CHODOSH, LEWIS A (contact); DEMICHELE, ANGELA ;","SONG, MIN-KYUNG H","12/13/2016","11/30/2021","Address; Adjuvant Radiotherapy; Adjuvant Therapy; Aftercare; Aspirate substance; Autophagocytosis; base; Biological; Biological Assay; Biological Markers; Biology; Bone Marrow; Breast Cancer Cell; Breast Cancer Patient; Breast Cancer survivor; cancer cell; Cancer Etiology; cancer recurrence; Cell Survival; Cells; Cessation of life; chemotherapy; Chloroquine; Clinic; Clinical; clinical efficacy; Clinical Treatment; Clinical Trials; Coupled; Data; Detection; Development; Disease; Distant; Dose; Early Diagnosis; Flow Cytometry; FRAP1 gene; Future; Genetically Engineered Mouse; Genomics; Human; Hydroxychloroquine; Immunohistochemistry; improved; innovation; insight; Intervention; Investigation; Killings; Laboratories; Lung Neoplasms; malignant breast neoplasm; Malignant Neoplasms; Mammary gland; Measures; Metastatic breast cancer; Metastatic to; Methods; Modeling; Molecular; molecular phenotype; Monitor; mortality; mouse model; Mus; Neoplasm Metastasis; neoplastic cell; next generation; novel; novel strategies; Oncogenic; open label; Operative Surgical Procedures; Outcome; Pathologic; Pathway interactions; Patients; Phenotype; pilot trial; Positive Lymph Node; pre-clinical; preclinical trial; prevent; Primary Neoplasm; prognostic tool; Randomized; Recurrence; Residual Cancers; Residual Neoplasm; Residual state; Residual Tumors; response; Risk; Safety; screening; SDZ RAD; Secondary Prevention; Signal Transduction; Sirolimus; Site; surveillance study; targeted agent; Testing; Therapeutic; tool; Translating; triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma; tumor; Tumor Biology; Woman; ","Secondary Prevention through Surveillance and Intervention","208273","CONC","Clinical Oncology Study Section ","","A1","01","414943","253115","668058",""
