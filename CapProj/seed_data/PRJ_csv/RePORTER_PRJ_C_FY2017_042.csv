The Williams Laboratory has previously identified and validated Rac (a protein that controls many cellular functions including cell growth) as a therapeutic target in refractory leukemias.This group has expertise and a long-standing interest in the biology of the Rac protein. For this project, the Williams Lab has partnered with Evotec AG, a drug discovery company based in Germany, to utilize novel platforms and techniques to identify and further develop new inhibitors of Rac. The end point of this partnership is to obtain a drug that can be used for clinical testing in high risk leukemias and can improve the prognosis of these aggressive diseases.","1862385; ","WILLIAMS, DAVID A;","KONDAPAKA, SUDHIR B","07/20/2016","06/30/2021","absorption; Acute leukemia; Affinity Chromatography; Alternative Splicing; analog; Animal Model; Attenuated; bcr-abl Fusion Proteins; Binding; Biochemical; Bioinformatics; Biology; Candidate Disease Gene; cell growth; Cell Line; Cell model; Cell physiology; cellular targeting; Characteristics; Chronic Myeloid Leukemia; Code; Collaborations; Colon Carcinoma; Computer Simulation; conventional therapy; Crystallography; Data; Development; Disease; Dose; drug discovery; Excretory function; exhibitions; Exhibits; experience; extracellular; Family; Genetic; Genetic Models; Germany; Guanosine Triphosphate Phosphohydrolases; Hematopoietic stem cells; high risk; Human; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; inhibitor/antagonist; interest; knock-down; Laboratories; Lead; Lesion; leukemia; Leukemic Cell; Malignant - descriptor; malignant breast neoplasm; Malignant neoplasm of lung; Malignant Neoplasms; Mammalian Cell; Mediating; melanoma; Metabolism; Modeling; Molecular; Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins; Mus; Mutate; Mutation; new therapeutic target; novel; Oncogenes; oncology; outcome forecast; Output; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pharmaceutical Chemistry; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase; Play; Pre-Clinical Model; preclinical development; programs; Property; Proteins; rac GTP-Binding Proteins; Refractory; Relapse; relapse risk; research clinical testing; response; rho GTP-Binding Proteins; Role; Sampling; screening; Series; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; small hairpin RNA; small molecule inhibitor; Solid; Solid Neoplasm; Specificity; stem cell biology; targeted cancer therapy; Techniques; Testing; Therapeutic; therapeutic target; TimeLine; tool; Validation; virtual; Work; Xenograft Model; ","Development of novel selective Rac inhibitors for refractory leukemias","202756","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","411614","191420","603034",""

Our ADCC will focus on the transition from normal aging to mild cognitive impairment and then to AD and other dementias, and understanding the contribution of metabolic and vascular factors to these transitions. The ADCC will enroll a diverse group of ~1,000 adults to facilitate the discovery of new biomarkers and promising targets for prevention and therapy. We will also utilize novel nonhuman primate models to promote pivotal mechanistic and translational research. Finally, we will educate new investigators in translational research practices, and health professionals, afflicted adults, their families, and their communities about AD and strategies for reducing risk.","1857825; ","CRAFT, SUZANNE ;","SILVERBERG, NINA B.","09/01/2016","06/30/2021","Address; Adult; African American; Age; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease Core Center; Area; Bioenergetics; Biological Markers; Blood Vessels; Brain; Capsicum; Clinical; Clinical Data; Clinical Sciences; Clinical Trials Network; Cognitive; Cognitive aging; cohort; Collaborations; Communities; Complex; Data; data resource; Dementia; Diabetes Mellitus; Disease; disparity reduction; Early Intervention; Education; Elderly; Enrollment; Epidemic; Epigenetic Process; ethnic diversity; Ethnic Origin; experience; Family; Fatty Acids; forest; Foundations; Functional disorder; Funding; General Population; Genetic; Genomics; Glucose; Growth; health equity; Health Professional; High Prevalence; Human; innovation; Institutes; Institutionalization; Insulin Resistance; Interdisciplinary Study; Investigation; Leadership; Longitudinal Studies; medical schools; Metabolic; metabolic abnormality assessment; Metabolic Diseases; mild cognitive impairment; Mitochondria; Modeling; NHANES; nonhuman primate; normal aging; novel; novel strategies; outreach; Participant; Patients; Phase Transition; Prediabetes syndrome; Predictive Factor; Prevalence; Prevention; Prevention strategy; Prevention therapy; Preventive Intervention; programs; repository; Research; Research Activity; Research Infrastructure; Research Personnel; resilience; Resources; Risk; Risk Factors; Services; Strategic Planning; symptom treatment; Therapeutic; Training; translational pipeline; Translational Research; United States National Institutes of Health; Vascular Cognitive Impairment; vascular contributions; Vascular Diseases; vascular factor; ","Wake Forest Alzheimer's Disease Core Center","049638","ZAG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","1175920","570877","1746797",""

Even with effective exercise training to improve fitness (CVEC), there remains an uncorrected deficit in people with T2D that is potentially remediable if we understand the cause. The goal of this proposal is to test the overall hypothesis that: impaired CVEC in T2D is the result of systemic cardiovascular changes in oxygen uptake and delivery. Limiting oxygen delivery to the heart and skeletal muscle function interferes with the adjustments the body must make during exercise.

To address this knowledge gap, the present study seeks to define the role of inflammatory monocytes, which are a subset of innate immune cells that play a key role in immunity and host defense, in a murine model of NTS gastroenteritis. Results are expected to have fundamental implications for understanding host interactions with bacterial pathogens. Thus, the proposed research is of high relevance to human health.","9428262; ","VAN DER VELDEN, ADRIANUS WILHELMUS MARIA;","ALEXANDER, WILLIAM A.","07/14/2017","06/30/2019","Address; Anaerobic Bacteria; Area; CC chemokine receptor 2; Cells; Cessation of life; Clinical; Colitis; Communicable Diseases; Crohn's disease; defined contribution; Development; Digestive System Disorders; Disease; Enzymes; Epithelial Cells; Gastroenteritis; Generations; Genes; Growth; gut microbiome; gut microbiota; Health; Host Defense; Human; Immune; Immunity; Infection; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Inflammatory disease of the intestine; inflammatory modulation; Inflammatory Response; innovation; intestinal epithelium; Intestines; Invaded; Knowledge; Methodology; Microbe; monocyte; Mononuclear; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; mouse model; neutrophil; Nitrates; Nitric Oxide; NOS2A gene; novel strategies; novel therapeutics; Oxidants; pathogen; pathogenic bacteria; Pathology; Phagocytes; Play; Production; Publishing; Reactive Oxygen Species; Recruitment Activity; Research; Respiration; response; Role; Salmonella; Salmonella enterica; Source; Spatial Distribution; Syndrome; Testing; Tissues; Ulcerative Colitis; ","Role of inflammatory monocytes in Salmonella-induced colitis","128372","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","01","150000","86029","236029",""

Biomedical and clinician scientists are of fundamental importance for biomedical research, as they form a bridge between clinicians and medical scientists, are the most qualified to ask the proper scientific health related questions, and have been referred to as the gateway into health of ideas from scientists at large. This concern is based on documented facts such as the progressive decline in the percentage of NIH awarded research project grants going to MD's or MD/PhD's, the progressive decline in the actual number of first-time MD applicants for NIH research project grants, and the progressive decline in the total number of MD post- doctoral trainees supported by NIH. One of the causes for these declining numbers has been the inability of clinical departments to keep pace with the rate and complexity of scientific progress. Consequently, a priority of this training program is to ensure that its trainees acquire an in-depth education and expertise that combines the study of renal physiology or pathophysiology and the development of skills in one or more areas of basic or applied sciences.","1885395; ","LIESKE, JOHN C;","RYS-SIKORA, KRYSTYNA E","07/01/1975","04/30/2019","Kidney Diseases; Research Training; Training Programs; ","Kidney Disease Research Training Program","007013","ZDK1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","S1","38","8221","658","8879",""

However, there have been few studies to examine the direct connection between Wnt signaling and specific lung diseases. While Wnt signaling is activated in lung fibrosis and lung diseases involving smooth muscle hyperplasia including asthma and pulmonary hypertension, little is known about the causative role Wnt plays in lung disease. Our preliminary data also show a strong correlation between Wnt signaling and pediatric cystic lung disease such as CCAMs. Wnt signaling is a focus of therapeutic intervention as several agonists and antagonists have been developed opening the possibility of their use in pulmonary diseases. Given the dramatic affect that loss and gain of Wnt signaling have on lung progenitor development and adult regeneration from our published and preliminary studies, continued characterization of whether this important pathway is causative in pediatric and postnatal lung disease as well as the potential mechanisms of how Wnt affects lung regeneration will have a profound impact on development of future therapies for human lung disease.","1865475; ","MORRISEY, EDWARD E;","LIN, SARA ","04/01/2007","06/30/2018","Adult; Affect; Agonist; Alveolar; Asthma; autocrine; Blood Vessels; Cells; Childhood; Complex; Congenital Cystic Adenomatoid Malformation of Lung; Data; Defect; defined contribution; Development; Distal; Endoderm; Epithelial; Etiology; Funding; Future; Generations; Heart; Homeostasis; Human; Hyperplasia; Injury; Lead; Lesion; Ligands; Lung; lung development; Lung diseases; lung injury; lung regeneration; malformation; Mesenchymal; Mesenchyme; Mesoderm; Modeling; Molecular; Morphogenesis; Myofibroblast; Natural regeneration; Nature; novel; paracrine; Pathway interactions; Pattern; pediatric patients; Phenotype; Play; postnatal; Process; progenitor; public health relevance; Publishing; Pulmonary Fibrosis; Pulmonary Hypertension; Pulmonary veins; receptor; Regulation; Reporting; Respiration; respiratory; response; response to injury; Role; Series; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Smooth Muscle; Structure; Techniques; Therapeutic Intervention; tool; Trees; WNT Signaling Pathway; ","Regulation of Airway Morphogenesis and Differentiation by Wnt Signaling","087825","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","10","250000","150000","400000",""

RDS has emerged as one of the premier data collection approaches for hard to survey subpopulations such as those at high risk of contracting HIV. While RDS has seen substantial methodological development around the estimation of disease prevalence and other univariate statistics, statistical development around the estimation of parameters from multivariate regression models with RDS data has previously escaped attention. Despite hundreds of RDS samples having been collected using more than $166 million in federal funding, there is deep uncertainty in the literature about the best approaches to estimating parameters from multivariate models with these data. Indeed, the literature offers no clear guidelines and, as such, we found more than 10 separate approaches to estimating parameters from these models with little consideration to which work best. This is unfortunate because many of the classic methods of data analysis in the social and public health sciences rely on multivariate regression models to understand risk factors, rule out alternative explanations, and test the robustness of results. We will use a simulation evaluation framework to analyze the properties of the most popular approaches to RDS regression estimation found in the literature, and we will develop and offer clear guidelines linked to shared statistical software that other researchers can apply to obtain unbiased and efficient parameters for multivariate models with RDS data.

This build up can result in convulsions, and seizures, and if at a high enough dose, death. The current US Army standard of care (SOC) reactivators can revive poisoned AChE; however, there are limitations for their use in mass casualty situations by the toxicity, poor penetration of the bloo brain barrier (BBB), rapid clearance pharmacokinetics, and treatment regimen especially against depot forming nerve agents (i.e. V- agents). We propose therefore to evaluate novel sugar linked reactivators of AChE with broader specificity, improved pharmacokinetics, and potential to cross the blood brain barrier. Compounds will be screened in silico for reactivation and transport potential. Compounds will be synthesized in analytical quantities for in vitro reactivation potential and BBB testing in cell culture model. The information will be used to refine the computer models. Lead compounds will be selected for large scale synthesis. Acute toxicity experiments will be done to determine the LD50 and efficacy testing will then be done using an LD12.5 to determine brain AChE reactivation in mouse models. Based on these results the compounds will be evaluated for transition to the USAMRICD CORE program for GLP efficacy studies in larger rodent species.","10385702; ","MCDONOUGH, JOHN H.;","YEUNG, DAVID ","08/01/2013","01/31/2018","Acetylcholine; Acetylcholinesterase; acute toxicity; analytical method; Antidotes; Atropine; Biological Availability; Blood - brain barrier anatomy; Brain; Cell Culture Techniques; cell type; cerebral capillary; Cessation of life; Chemicals; Chlorpyrifos; Cholinergic Receptors; Computer Simulation; Continuous Infusion; Convulsions; Coupling; Data; Diazepam; Docking; Dose; Drug Kinetics; efficacy study; efficacy testing; Emergency Health Services; Endothelial Cells; Epithelial Cells; experimental study; Glucose; Glucose Transporter; improved; In Vitro; Intramuscular; Lead; Lethal Dose 50; Link; mass casualty; Military Personnel; Modeling; mouse model; Mus; nerve agent; Neurotransmitters; novel; Organophosphates; Oximes; Paraoxon; Parathion; Penetration; Pesticides; Pharmaceutical Preparations; pharmacophore; Poisoning; Principal Investigator; programs; Proteins; public health relevance; Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship; Regimen; Rodent; Sarin; screening; Seizures; Site; SLC2A1 gene; Specificity; standard of care; sugar; Symptoms; Testing; Therapeutic; Tokyo; Toxic effect; Treatment Protocols; United States; VX nerve gas; ","Improved standard of care reactivaters and facilitative transport into the centra","083448","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","03","468195","0","468195",""

Thompson, Alberola-lla, Kincade, Sun, Olson, and Wang (as well as additional non-COBRE investigators). Although some of the facility's structural design and architectural finish is outdated, the health status ofthe rodent colonies is presently at a high level similar to that in the rodent barrier at Bell; however, its entry requirements are less strict. As the barrier facility is preferably reserved for breeding colonies, the Chapman vivarium is ideal for experimental animals from the perspective of ease of accessibility, proximity to research labs, smaller rooms for separation of research colonies providing a quiet environment and contemporary housing equipment including individually ventilated cages and automatic watering systems. Two COBRE-supported Junior Investigators will use this facility. Lorin Olson, Ph.D. will use sophisticated mouse models to investigate the consequences of constitutive PDGF receptor signaling on the development of fibrosis. Weidong Wang, Ph.D. will evaluate the potential of various pancreatic progenitor cells to develop into functioning p-cells by transplanting them into mice and testing the ability of the mice to maintain glucose control.  Many investigators at OMRF are sharing animals with other institutions, sending genetically engineered mice to and also receiving mutant lines from collaborators. There are about 50-60 incoming shipments per year with up to 6 in quarantine housing at the same time. In contrast to approved commercial vendors, nonapproved vendors/institutions often ship animals of partially unknown health status through a transport process that is less controlled from a biocontainment standpoint. Therefore, those rodents undergo a quarantine period  and subsequent intense testing for infectious agents. In the high pace of the current research environment, keeping rodent colonies specific pathogen free is challenging, and isolated outbreaks of infections occur.  These require subsequent treatment or depopulation ofthe respective housing area. If this has occurred at a collaborator's facility, it leads, in general, to diversion of the animals into the PHF facility rather than to the OMRF campus quarantine, even if those rodents had not been held directly in the affected rooms but simply in the same vivarium. The latter causes undesirable obstacles due to the remote location and introduction of unwanted variables into research experiments. To control this, animals must be rederived, delaying studies  and wasting valuable resources. A quarantine area with separate, smaller rooms instead of a large quarantine room will allow isolation of shipments and acceptance of rodents with a less than perfect health report and therefore accelerate studies. Thus, the proposed renovations would benefit Junior Investigators supported directly by this COBRE as well as all the scientists at OMRF using mouse models.","11390481; ","GOGRAFE, SYLVIA ;","","","","Accreditation; Affect; animal care; Animal Experimentation; animal facility; Animal Model; animal research subject; Animals; Architecture; Area; Biomedical Research; blood glucose regulation; Breeding; Cell Transplants; Centers of Research Excellence; commercialization; Containment; Control Animal; Controlled Environment; Day Care; design; Development; Developmental Biology; Disease Outbreaks; effective therapy; Enteral; Environment; Environmental Monitoring; Equipment; Ethics; experimental study; Eye; Facility Designs; Failure; Fibrosis; Floor; Fostering; Foundations; Genetically Engineered Mouse; germ free condition; Health; Health Status; Hospital Administration; Housing; human disease; Immunocompromised Host; Income; Individual; Infection; Infectious Agent; innovation; Institutes; Institution; Laboratory Animals; Laboratory Research; Light; Medical Research; microbial; Modeling; Modernization; mouse model; Mus; mutant; Noise; noise pollution; Oklahoma; Pancreas; pathogen; Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor; pressure; programs; Quarantine; Receptor Signaling; remote location; Reporting; Research; Research Institute; Research Personnel; Research Project Grants; Resources; Rodent; Sanitation; Scientist; seal; Services; Ships; Site; Standardization; Stem cells; System; Testing; The Sun; Time; Transgenic Organisms; Transport Process; United States Department of Veterans Affairs; Universities; Vendor; vibration; wasting; Water; ","Alterations & Renovations","103636","ZGM1","Special Emphasis Panel ","8387","","05","13636","9272","","22908"

Toward uncovering these molecular programs, we have used epigenomic and transcriptomic profiling techniques to reveal the genes, enhancers, and DNA binding transcription factors that are active during cardiac regeneration.

We now propose to extend this approach to other Gram-negative organism, to use these guidelines to convert certain Gram- positive-only drugs to broad spectrum agents, and to identify novel classes of compounds active against the most problematic Gram-negative pathogens.","8062717; ","HERGENROTHER, PAUL ;","FABIAN, MILES ","07/15/2017","04/30/2021","Amination; Amines; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Antibiotics; Bacterial Drug Resistance; Biological; Biological Assay; Collection; Computer Analysis; Data; Data Analyses; design; design and construction; Development; drug candidate; Drug resistance; Employee Strikes; Escherichia coli; Evaluation; Face; Failure; FDA approved; flexibility; Goals; Gram-Negative Bacteria; Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections; Gram-Positive Bacteria; Guidelines; Hospitals; Infection; Klebsiella pneumonia bacterium; Knowledge; Lead; Libraries; Linezolid; Mediating; member; Membrane; microorganism; Natural Products; Nitrogen; Nosocomial Infections; novel; novel drug class; novel therapeutics; Organism; Outcome; Output; pathogen; Penetration; Pharmaceutical Preparations; pleuromutilin; Property; Public Health; Pump; Reporting; Resources; Retrospective Studies; screening; Series; Shapes; small molecule; Staphylococcus aureus; Testing; trait; VDAC1 gene; Work; ","Defining Parameters for Compound Accumulation in Gram-Negative Pathogens","118575","DDR","Drug Discovery and Mechanisms of Antimicrobial Resistance Study Section ","","A1","01","239492","89960","329452",""

The supply of GMP bryostatin 1 is nearly if not exhausted, the future supply is at best uncertain, and it is likely that superior and more synthetically accessible agents could be identified. Plans to address these problems are presented including a) a strategy for the scalable synthesis of bryostatin 1, b) a first-of-its-kind integrated experimental and computational plan to understand at a structural and dynamic level how bryostatin binds to its protein kinase C (PKC) targets in a membrane environment, and c) the use of that knowledge to design, synthesize and preclinically advance potentially superior and more synthetically accessible analogs for the eradication of HIV/AIDS, treatment of Alzheimer's disease and small molecule enhanced immunotherapy.","1863991; ","WENDER, PAUL ANTHONY;","FU, YALI ","07/01/1981","05/31/2021","Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Address; Affinity; AIDS/HIV problem; Alzheimer's Disease; analog; Animals; anticancer research; antiretroviral therapy; apoptolidin; Apoptosis Promoter; Award; Binding; Biochemical; Biological; Biological Assay; Biological Sciences; Brain; bryostatin; Budgets; Cancer cell line; cancer immunotherapy; cancer therapy; career; Cells; Chronic; Clinic; Clinical; clinical candidate; Clinical Research; Clinical Treatment; Clinical Trials; Cloud Computing; cluster computing; cohort; Comparative Study; Complex; Computer Simulation; cost; Cyclic GMP; design; Development; Drug Delivery Systems; Enrollment; Enteral; Environment; Evaluation; exhaust; exhibitions; Exhibits; Fermentation; Foundations; Funding; Future; Goals; Grant; guanidinium; Health; Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor; HIV; Home environment; Human; Immunotherapy; improved; Individual; kinase inhibitor; Knowledge; Label; Lead; Learning; Ligands; Lung; Malignant Neoplasms; Membrane; Messenger RNA; Methodology; Molecular; molecular dynamics; molecular transporter; Mus; Natural Products; novel therapeutics; Nuclear; pandemic disease; Pathway interactions; Patients; Peptides; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase; Plasmids; Postdoctoral Fellow; pre-clinical; preclinical study; Production; programs; Protein Isoforms; Protein Kinase C; Proteins; Proviruses; public health relevance; Publications; Redness; Reporting; Research; research study; Resistance; Retinal; Rotation; Sampling; Seminal; Series; Signal Pathway; Skin; Small Interfering RNA; small molecule; solid state; solid state nuclear magnetic resonance; Structure; Structure-Activity Relationship; Students; Technology; Testing; Therapeutic; Time; Toxic effect; uptake; Virus; Work; ","Synthetic Studies Related to Cancer Research/Treatment","031845","SBCA","Synthetic and Biological Chemistry A Study Section ","","","37","284234","160851","445085",""

In this context, the current study proposes the first evaluation of an integrated model whereby the effects of early life adversity on risk for poorer adulthood health are hypothesized to be partially ?transmitted? by childhood educational achievement and experiences. The unique dataset we will be using to test these hypotheses (i.e., the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development, focused on a cohort followed prospectively from infancy) will also allow for (a) tests of alternative hypotheses related to childhood health (i.e., early ill health confounds the association between early education and adult health) and family background confounds (i.e., parental education and IQ confound the association between education and adult physical health) and (b) exploratory tests of childhood moderators and adult lifestyle mediators of the association between childhood educational variables and adult physical health risk markers.","9281335 (contact); 6100290; ","BLEIL, MARIA E.

While at least half of all umbilical-associated birth defects are classified as Rare and Orphan Diseases by the National Institutes of Health (://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/), their underlying etiology is unknown, as the mechanism by which the umbilical vasculature joins to that of the fetus is completely obscure. Recently, we discovered a small arterial blood vessel, provisionally named the 'Vessel of Confluence' (VOC), which, at a precise time and place, connects the umbilical vasculature to the arterial systems of the fetus and yolk sac. Unexpectedly, the origin of the VOC appears to lie within a segment of hitherto poorly-characterized hypoblast, an extraembryonic inducing tissue common to all Mammalia yet whose properties elsewhere in the conceptus are only just emerging. Referred to as 'allantois-associated posterior visceral endoderm' (aPVE), we will test the hypothesis that this cryptic epithelium drives the formation of the VOC via two major signaling pathways, Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) and Hedgehog (Hh), both of which display unique localization patterns in this region. Intriguingly, Hh and FGFs have been implicated in two orphan diseases, omphalocoele (Hh) at the umbilical ring, and sirenomelia (FGF), in which a single umbilical artery is misconnected to the fetal midline aorta. We anticipate that our results will not only provide critical new insight into these severe birth defects, but serve as a fundamental first step in unifying the etiology of a large number of apparently unrelated Rare and Orphan Human Diseases.","1942931; ","DOWNS, KAREN M;","ILEKIS, JOHN V","09/27/2014","06/30/2019","Address; allantois; Anatomy; Aorta; Apoptosis; Applications Grants; Arteries; Biological Models; Biological Process; Birth; Blood Circulation; Blood flow; Blood Island; Blood Vessels; Cardiovascular system; Cell Death; cell motility; Cells; Complex; Conceptus; Congenital Abnormality; Data; Defect; Development; Disease; Distress; Dorsal; Embryo; Embryology; Endoderm; Ensure; epithelial to mesenchymal transition; Epithelium; Erinaceidae; Etiology; Evaluation; exhibitions; Exhibits; experimental study; Failure; fetal; fetal blood; Fetal Growth; Fetus; Fibroblast Growth Factor; Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 1; gain of function; Genetic; Goals; Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycan; Human; human disease; Hypoblast; Immunohistochemistry; improved; insight; Literature; loss of function; Mammals; Maternal-Fetal Exchange; Mesoderm; Methods; Molecular; Molecular Biology; Morphology; Mothers; Mus; mutant; Names; Neonatal; neonate; Orphan; Outcome; outcome forecast; Outcome Study; Pathway interactions; Pattern; Pharmacology; Play; Pregnancy; Process; Property; public health relevance; Rare Diseases; Reproductive Biology; Research Proposals; Risk Factors; Role; Scientist; screening; Shapes; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Sirenomelia; Site; smoothened signaling pathway; Source; Structure; Structure of umbilical artery; System; Techniques; Testing; Therapeutic; Time; Tissues; Tube; Umbilical Blood; Umbilical cord structure; United States National Institutes of Health; vasculogenesis; Visceral; Yolk Sac; ","The fetal-umbilical connection:  role of hypoblast/visceral endoderm","079481","PN","Pregnancy and Neonatology Study Section ","","","04","207500","101434","308934",""

They arise when the neural tube fails to close during early embryo development. Up to 70% NTDs in human populations are thought to be due to genetic factors, with intrauterine environmental factors tipping the balance toward NTD in at risk individuals. NTDs stand out as a preventable birth defect, as periconceptional use of folic acid (FA) prevents a significant percentage of the population burden of NTDs. The strength of this Program is in its translation of mechanistic hypotheses generated from human genetic studies, interpreted in light of mouse mutant data and tested in human stem cell-derived and ?humanized? mouse models of NTD-associated genetic polymorphisms and maternal-fetal conditions in the intrauterine environment. These studies are the necessary antecedent of more effective, and individually tailored therapies to ensure healthy birth outcomes.","2075379; ","ROSS, MARGARET ELIZABETH;","HENKEN, DEBORAH B.","09/23/2011","06/30/2021","3-Dimensional; Affect; Anencephaly and spina bifida X linked; Arsenic; Biological; Birth; case control; Cell Culture Techniques; cell injury; Cell Polarity; Cells; Child; cohort; Complex; Congenital Abnormality; CRISPR/Cas technology; Cyst; Data; Data Set; Defect; Development; Embryo; embryo culture; Embryonic Development; Ensure; Environment; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Risk Factor; Equilibrium; Family; fetal; Folic Acid; Frequencies; Funding; gene environment interaction; Generations; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Polymorphism; genetic risk factor; Genetic study; genetic variant; genome editing; Goals; Grant; Guns; high throughput screening; Human; human embryonic stem cell; Human Genetics; human genomics; human stem cells; human subject; humanized mouse; Hydrogen Peroxide; improved; In Vitro; Individual; Light; Measures; Mediating; Metabolic Pathway; Metabolism; metabolomics; Methods; Mitochondria; Modeling; Molecular; mouse model; Mus; Mutant Strains Mice; Mutation; Neural tube; Neural Tube Closure; Neural Tube Defects; Neuroepithelial; Neuroepithelial Cells; Nitrates; nitration; Nitric Oxide Synthase; nitrosative stress; NOS3 gene; novel; novel strategies; Nutritional status; Outcome; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidative Stress; Parents; Pathway interactions; Patients; Peroxonitrite; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phosphorylation; Population; prevent; Prevention; Prevention strategy; programs; Proteins; Proteomics; rare variant; Regimen; relating to nervous system; Risk; Risk Assessment; risk variant; Role; Serine; Severities; Signal Pathway; small molecule; Source; Spinal Dysraphism; stable isotope; stem cell differentiation; Stem cells; Stress; Structural defect; Structure; Superoxides; Supplementation; Technology; Teratogens; Testing; trafficking; Translations; Untranslated RNA; Variant; whole genome; ","Risk Genes and Environmental Interactions in Neural Tube Defects","067244","ZHD1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","07","983925","362477","1346402",""

Benner  Zunyi Yang NARRATIVE Recent experience with Zika, Ebola, Chikungunya, dengue, and other RNA viruses points to deficiencies in the ability of the nation to respond to emerging pathogens. For example, in Miami this month, pregnant women who had developed a rash following a mosquito bite are being asked by the CDC to wait for two to four weeks before learning whether they have been infected by the Zika virus. This despite the fact that the Benner laboratory has technology that will allow diagnosis within 20 minutes, from a urine sample that requires no upfront processing. Limiting this technology is the fact that Zika, like most other RNA viral pathogens, rapidly changes its sequence, sometimes for adaptation, but primarily via neutral drift. This allows the virus to escape from primers and probes designed to detect its presence and, once detected, to allow identification of medically informative single nucleotide variation. The project proposed here advances ?biversal nucleotides? to manage this divergence, the enzymes they interact with, and the architectures that use them. This will support FDA approvable diagnostics products to move towards points of sampling, for Zika first but for all rapidly diverging pathogen sequences.","6299669; ","BENNER, STEVEN A;","BROWN, LILIANA L.","07/15/2017","06/30/2019","Accident and Emergency department; Arboviruses; Architecture; Authorization documentation; base; Benchmarking; Binding; Biological; Biological Assay; Biology; Bite; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.); Chemicals; Chemistry; chikungunya; Clinical; cold temperature; Culicidae; Data; Defect; Dengue; design; Detection; Development; Diagnosis; Diagnostic; DNA; DNA Structure; Ebola virus; Emergency Situation; Enzymes; Evolution; Exanthema; experience; FDA approved; flexibility; Foundations; Frequencies; genetic information; Hydrogen Bonding; individual patient; Informatics; Information Systems; innovation; Investigation; Laboratories; Learning; Left; Length; Ligation; Measures; Medical; Methods; Mole the mammal; Molecular; Molecular Biology; Molecular Evolution; molecular recognition; Molecular Structure; Morphologic artifacts; Mutation; novel; Nucleic Acids; nucleobase; Nucleotides; Outcome; pathogen; Patients; Performance; Physicians' Offices; point of care; Polymerase; Population; Pregnant Women; Preparation; prevent; Purines; Pyrimidine; Pyrimidines; Reagent; recombinase; respiratory virus; RNA; RNA Sequences; RNA Viruses; RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase; Sampling; Specificity; Structure; sugar; synthetic biology; System; Technology; Temperature; Testing; tool; Uncertainty; Urine; Variant; Viral; Viral Genome; viral RNA; Virus; Work; Yang; Zika Virus; ","Nucleic Acid Innovations to Manage Pathogen Sequence Divergence","133567","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","125000","60000","185000",""

We have recently found that administration of methylene blue, which is in the WHO's list of essential medications, dramatically increases survival in H2S induced coma by rapidly restoring the cardiac function depressed by H2S and improves the short and long-term neurological outcomes. These findings have prompted us to develop this proposal which will 1- extend our findings in larger mammals and in unsedated animals exposed to H2S intoxication by inhalation, 2- describe the mechanisms for the action of methylene blue on isolated cardiac cells and on neurons, the main targets of H2S toxicity.

This study will provide new information on the best behavioral intervention approaches for pain in patients with cancer by using a novel approached to a controlled clinical trial (sequential multiple assignment randomized trial [SMART]). The information gained by this is likely to lead to more cancer patients with pain being offered and receiving a behavioral intervention that is right for their specific needs.

These studies have the potential for a high impact in the clinic, as we believe a targeted approach of epigenetic reprogramming by microRNA will eventually enhance and extend the health and well-being of patients through the fine tuning of stem cell function. Indeed, one microRNA decoying technique has already come of age for the treatment of blood-borne disease, and others will certainly prove highly effective for the treatment of hematological malignancies. Our proposed studies are designed to uncover a function for a microRNA-epigenetic pathway in the control of hematopoiesis, a finding, which will in turn lead to novel therapeutic approaches to disease onset, progression and management for patients with myeloid malignancies, and possibly other forms of tissue tumorigenesis.","9495176; ","ITO, KEISUKE ;","BISHOP, TERRY ROGERS","09/01/2014","06/30/2018","3' Untranslated Regions; Ablation; Affect; Attenuated; Biogenesis; Bioinformatics; Biological Assay; blood treatment; Bone Marrow Cells; Cell Line; Cell physiology; Cell Proliferation; Cells; Clinic; Clinical; Clinical Data; Clinical Trials; cohort; Custom; Data; Data Set; design; Disease; DNA Methylation; Down-Regulation; Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes; Ectopic Expression; effective therapy; Epigenetic Process; epigenetic regulation; Event; Evolution; exhibitions; Exhibits; Gene Targeting; gene translocation; Genes; Genetic; genetic manipulation; genome-wide; Goals; Health; Hematologic Neoplasms; Hematology; Hematopoiesis; Hematopoietic; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Hematopoietic stem cells; Hematopoietic System; Human; Hydroxylation; Impairment; In Vitro; in vivo; Ineffective Hematopoiesis; Injury; Knockout Mice; Lead; leukemia; Leukemic Cell; leukemogenesis; Link; Luciferases; Maintenance; Malignant - descriptor; Messenger RNA; MicroRNAs; Molecular; Molecular Abnormality; mouse model; Multiple Myeloma; Mus; Myeloid Leukemia; Myeloproliferative disease; novel; novel therapeutic intervention; Oncogenic; oncology; Onset of illness; Outcome; overexpression; Pathogenesis; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Patients; Penetrance; Personal Satisfaction; Phenotype; Play; Porifera; Pre-Clinical Model; pre-clinical trial; programs; Proteins; Proto-Oncogenes; public health relevance; reduce symptoms; Regulation; Regulatory Element; Reporter; Repression; Research; Role; Safety; Sampling; self-renewal; Specimen; stem; stem cell biology; stem cell division; stem cell niche; Stem cells; Supportive care; Survival Rate; Techniques; Therapeutic; therapeutic evaluation; therapeutic target; Time; Tissues; Transgenic Mice; Transplantation; tumorigenesis; Untranslated RNA; Work; Xenograft Model; ","Epigenetic regulation by microRNA of MDS pathogenesis","100689","MCH","Molecular and Cellular Hematology Study Section ","","","05","150000","100500","250500",""

Results from this study could help improve identification of older adults at risk of diabetes, advance our understanding of the biology of fatty acids in relation to this disorder and its consequences, and provide potential new targets for novel drug development to prevent diabetes and its cardiovascular complications.","6921216 (contact); 2087177; ","DJOUSSE, LUC  (contact); MUKAMAL, KENNETH JAY;","JOSEPH, LYNDON ","09/15/2016","04/30/2020","Accounting; Address; adjudicate; adverse outcome; Age; Aging; Agonist; American; Atrial Fibrillation; Basic Science; Behavior Therapy; Biological; Biology; cardiometabolic risk; Cardiovascular Diseases; cardiovascular health; cardiovascular risk factor; Cardiovascular system; Cholesterol; Clinical; cohort; Cohort Studies; cost; cost effective; Data; Data Coordinating Center; design; Development; diabetes management; Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetes prevention; diabetes prevention program; diabetes risk; Diagnosis; disability; Disease; disorder risk; drug development; Drug Targeting; Elderly; Epidemiology; Event; Fasting; fatty acid metabolism; Fatty Acids; Future; Glucose; glucose production; glucose transport; Healthcare; Heart failure; Hepatic; high risk; Hour; improved; Individual; insight; insulin sensitivity; insulin signaling; Intervention; Knowledge; Life Style; lifestyle intervention; Lifestyle Therapy; Lipolysis; Measurement; Measures; Metabolic; Metformin; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Muscle; Myocardial Infarction; new therapeutic target; Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; Nonesterified Fatty Acids; novel; OGTT; Oral; Outcomes Research; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Pattern; Peripheral; Pharmacology; Pharmacotherapy; Phenotype; Play; Population; Population Sciences; Predisposition; Prevalence; prevent; Prevention; prospective; Prospective Studies; Quality of life; randomized trial; receptor; repository; Research; Resources; Risk; Role; Serum; Shapes; Specimen; stroke; success; Testing; Tissues; Translational Research; United States National Institutes of Health; Work; ","Non-esterified Fatty Acids and Cardiometabolic Disease in Older Adults","053325","KNOD","Kidney, Nutrition, Obesity and Diabetes ","","","02","623087","76728","699815",""

Ectoderm tissues become either the central nervous system, neural crest cells (make facial bone and cartilage and peripheral nervous system), or skin, and their formation is tightly regulated by cell adhesion proteins and transcriptional regulators, which maintain cell type specificity and cell fate. This project uses both avian and amphibian embryos to identify the mechanisms that regulate neural/crest/skin fate choice and the migration of neural crest cells during normal development, because abnormalities in any of these processes can lead to a number of common birth defects including neural tube defects, albinism, cleft palate and cancer.","11358805; ","ROGERS, CRYSTAL D;","HENKEN, DEBORAH B.","07/15/2017","06/30/2020","Adhesions; Albinism; Ambystoma; Ambystoma mexicanum; Amphibia; Animal Model; Biological Models; Birds; bone; cadherin 7; Cadherins; cancer cell; Cancer cell line; Cartilage; Cell Adhesion Molecules; Cell Communication; cell fate specification; cell motility; cell type; Cells; Cleft Palate; comparative; Congenital Abnormality; Congenital Megacolon; Consensus; craniofacial; Craniofacial Abnormalities; Data; Defect; Destinations; Development; Disease; Dorsal; E-Cadherin; Ectoderm; Embryo; Embryonic Development; Endoderm; Ensure; Epidermis; Epigenetic Process; Epithelial; Epithelial Cells; epithelial to mesenchymal transition; Event; face bone structure; Failure; Functional disorder; Genetic Transcription; Goals; In Vitro; in vivo; Intestines; Knowledge; Lead; loss of function; Malignant Palate Neoplasm; Mesenchymal; Mesoderm; migration; migratory population; Mole the mammal; Molecular; Morphogenesis; Morphology; Movement; Mus; Mutation; N-Cadherin; Nature; Neural Crest; Neural Crest Cell; Neural Fold; neural plate; Neural tube; Neural Tube Closure; Neural Tube Defects; Neural Tube Development; Neuraxis; Neuroepithelial Cells; Outcome; Peripheral Nervous System; physical separation; Play; prevent; Process; progenitor; Program Development; Proliferating; protein function; Proteins; Rana; relating to nervous system; Research; Research Proposals; Role; segregation; Sensory; Side; Site; Skin; Specificity; Spinal Dysraphism; Stem cells; Structure; System; Testing; Time; Tissue Differentiation; Tissues; vertebrate embryos; Vision; Work; ","Cadherin interactions in ectodermal derivative fate specification","092170","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","300000","135000","435000",""

Current sympatholytic drugs cause system-wide inactivation of sympathetic neurotransmission leading to multiple adverse effects. An alternative approach is to develop drugs that attenuate ONLY renovascular sympathetic neurotransmission. It may be possible by blocking renovascular A1 receptors or inhibiting kidney alkaline phosphatase to attenuate sympathetic nerve stimulation-induced renal vasoconstriction while leaving systemic sympathetic neurotransmission intact, thus yielding safe, convenient, and effective drugs for resistant hypertension.","1862958; ","JACKSON, EDWIN KERRY;","KETCHUM, CHRISTIAN J.","09/22/2016","06/30/2021","Adenosine; Adrenergic Receptor; Adverse effects; Alkaline Phosphatase; Animal Model; Attenuated; Blood Vessels; Catheters; Chronic; Dahl Hypertensive Rats; Data; Denervation; Drug resistance; Endothelial Cells; Enzymes; experimental study; extracellular; Funding; Genetic; Goals; Hypertension; in vivo; Kidney; kidney vascular structure; knock-down; Knock-out; Metabolism; Mus; Muscle Cells; Nerve; Neuroeffector Junction; neurotransmission; noradrenergic; Norepinephrine; novel; Organ; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacology; Phospholipase C; Pressoreceptors; Purines; Rattus; receptor; Resistance; Resistant Hypertension; response; Rodent; salt sensitive hypertension; Scheme; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Subgroup; Sympatholytics; System; Testing; Twin Multiple Birth; Varicosity; Vascular Smooth Muscle; vasoconstriction; Vasoconstrictor Agents; Work; ","Adenosine in Renal Sympathetic Neurotransmission","091190","HM","Hypertension and Microcirculation Study Section ","","","07","225000","124875","349875",""

Emerging data indicate that systemic pathology resulting from ANS dysfunction, contributes to intraspinal pathology and neurological impairment. How or why this happens is not known. New data, in humans and rodent models, show that the composition of bacteria in the gut (i.e., the microbiota) is disrupted after SCI. In rodents, we have found that gut dysbiosis impairs functional recovery and exacerbates intraspinal inflammation and lesion pathology. Importantly, post-injury oral delivery of probiotics containing ?good? bacteria, improves immune function and promotes functional recovery. Experiments in this proposal will yield a comprehensive database of changes gut microbes across a range of clinically-relevant variables that affect outcome after SCI (e.g., sex, injury level, injury severity). These data can be used as a ?biomarker? panel to help predict the onset or severity of common post-injury comorbidities including infection, anemia, metabolic syndrome and perhaps, secondary neurological deterioration. These same microbes could also be ?druggable? targets that could be manipulated via diet. For example, personalized nutraceuticals (e.g., pre- or probiotics) could be developed to treat the above co-morbidities and improve quality of life after SCI. Data in other experiments will explore how dysbiosis affects immune functions, revealing novel cellular and molecular targets that again could be ?druggable? leading to improved health and quality of life, despite persistent paralysis. Rather than ?treat the spinal cord?, this proposal seeks innovative ways to treat SCI as a systemic disorder. !","1873652; ","POPOVICH, PHILLIP G;","JAKEMAN, LYN B","07/15/2017","06/30/2022","Adverse effects; Affect; Anemia; Animals; Antibiotics; Autonomic nervous system; Bacteria; biomarker panel; Bladder; Blood; body system; Bone Marrow; Brain; Brain Stem; Butyrates; cell motility; cellular targeting; Clinical; clinically relevant; Colon; commensal microbes; Communities; Comorbidity; Data; Databases; Decentralization; Deterioration; Development; Diet; Disease; Distal; Ecology; Epigenetic Process; Epithelial; experimental study; fecal transplantation; Female; Foundations; functional disability; Functional disorder; Future; Ganglia; Gastrointestinal tract structure; Gene Expression; Genetic; Genetic Transcription; Genome; Germ-Free; Goals; gut microbiome; gut microbiota; Health; Homeostasis; Human; Immune; immune function; Immune system; Immunologics; immunoregulation; Impairment; imprint; improved; Infection; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Infusion procedures; injured; Injury; innovation; Intervention; Intestines; Learning; Lesion; macrophage; Maintenance; male; Measures; Mediating; Medical; Metabolic syndrome; metagenomic sequencing; Microbe; microbial community; microbiome; microbiota; Molecular Target; mouse model; Mus; Myelopoiesis; Natural immunosuppression; Nervous system structure; Neurologic; Neurons; neuroprotection; novel; Nutraceutical; Oral; Organ; Organism; Outcome; Paralysed; Pathologic; Pathology; Permeability; Phenotype; Physiology; Population; probiotic therapy; Probiotics; Quality of life; Recovery; Recovery of Function; Reflex action; Regulatory T-Lymphocyte; repaired; Research Project Grants; restoration; Rodent; Rodent Model; Role; Serotonin; Severities; sex; Spinal; Spinal Cord; Spinal cord injury; Spinal Injuries; Stimulus; Suspensions; Sympathetic Nervous System; System; Technology; Testing; Therapeutic; Tight Junctions; Time; Tracer; Translational Research; Tryptophan; ","Role of the spinal cord - gut - immune axis after spinal cord injury","099532","CNNT","Clinical Neuroplasticity and Neurotransmitters Study Section ","","A1","01","351726","193449","545175",""

Indeed, CRH was shown to play a significant role in the regulation of feeding and food intake, but the exact nature of its role is controversial. The homology between Drosophila DH44 and mammalian CRH is approximately 30% and between Drosophila and mammalian receptors is approximately 40%. Similar to Drosophila DH44, mammalian CRH regulates gastric and colonic movements, and stimulates defecation in rodents. CRH also mediates glucose homeostasis by regulating hypoglycemia-induced counterregulation. It was suggested that the function of glucose-sensing neurons is to generate neuroendocrine stress responses to the hypoglycemic challenge, but the identity of these neurons is unknown. It is possible that CRH neurons in the hypothalamus are glucose-sensing neurons as in the Drosophila brain and are capable of mediating starvation-induced behavioral responses to the nutritional value of sugar in mammals. Mice with compromised CRH function are indeed obese or anorexic. It is intriguing to speculate that obese individuals may be insensitive to the heightened circulating sugar levels after meals and therefore, continues to eat. By contrast, anorexic individuals may be too sensitive to circulating sugar levels and therefore, feel satiated and are reluctant to eat. The proposed research using the Drosophila model would provide a foundation for understanding the mechanisms by which internal sensors respond to the nutritional value of sugar in normal and obese individuals.","6915164; ","SUH, GREG S.B.;","KARP, ROBERT W","06/01/2015","05/31/2020","5'-AMP-activated protein kinase; Anatomy; Animal Feed; Animals; Axon; Behavioral Assay; behavioral response; biological adaptation to stress; Biological Assay; blood glucose regulation; Brain; Calcium; cell motility; Cells; conditioning; Consumption; Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone; Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone Receptors; counterregulation; Coupled; Defecation; Dendrites; Desire for food; Detection; Digestion; Diuretics; Dorsal; Drosophila genus; Eating; Eating Disorders; enantiomer; Environment; Esophageal; Esophagus; Excretory function; experimental study; Feedback; feeding; Feeding behaviors; fly; Food; Food deprivation (experimental); Food Processing; Foundations; Frequencies; Gastric Emptying; Genes; Glucose; Glucose Transporter; Goals; grasp; hexokinase; Hindgut; Homologous Gene; Hormones; Hypoglycemia; Hypothalamic structure; Image; in vivo; Individual; Ingestion; Interneurons; L-Glucose; Label; Laboratories; Locomotion; Mammals; Mediating; Modality; Modeling; Motor Neurons; Movement; Mus; mutant; Nature; Nerve; Neurons; Neuropeptides; Neurosecretory Systems; Nutritional; Obesity; Pathway interactions; Patients; Peptides; Peripheral; Physiological; Play; postsynaptic neurons; preference; Process; Property; public health relevance; receptor; Reflex action; Regulation; Research; Rodent; Role; RRM2 gene; sensor; Sequence Homology; Signaling Molecule; Starvation; Stomach; sugar; sweet taste perception; Sweetening Agents; System; Taste Buds; Taste Perception; Techniques; Technology; Testing; Time; ","Understanding the role of the brain CRH (Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone) system in the detection and consumption of nutritional sugar.","106636","SCS","Somatosensory and Chemosensory Systems Study Section ","","","03","225000","156375","381375",""

IBS results in significant chronic morbidity, healthcare consumption, decreased productivity and absenteeism with direct expenditures estimated at $20B billion per year. IBS treatments focus on symptoms, since deep mechanistic understanding of pathophysiology is limited. The enterochromaffin cells are a specialized cell type that form part of the lining of the gut. They are involved in both gastrointestinal motility and visceral sensatio, which are both abnormal in IBS. Further, abnormalities in enterochromaffin cells exist in IBS and addressing these abnormalities may allow for disease-focused therapies in IBS. Mechanical forces are a strong signal for enterochromaffin cell activation, but little is known regarding the precise mechanisms. Therefore, this work will focus on determining the precise mechanisms of enterochromaffin cell mechanosensitivity and how mechanical activation of the enterochromaffin cells controls gastrointestinal motility. The results of this work will have substantial public heath relevance.

To tailor healthcare services to groups at high risk for trauma exposure and PTSD, more information is needed on factors that may impact health outcomes over the long term. To date, risk associations have been understudied in older populations, and in older women, in particular.

Targeting peripheral opioid receptors has been proposed as an alternative to systemic opioids for management of chronic pain conditions, a strategy that avoids many centrally-mediated adverse effects. We propose a multidisciplinary experimental approach to investigate age-related changes in the efficacy of peripherally administered opioid in a rodent model of osteoarthritis with the goal of extending the use of peripherally administered opioids for pain management in the elderly. Based on accumulated evidence, we plan also to examine whether age-dependent changes in testosterone play a key role in regulating peripheral opioid receptor expression and function. The knowledge gained on the effects of age on peripheral analgesic mechanisms in preclinical models of persistent pain conditions and underlying mechanisms promises to provide a rationale for approaches to the treatment of elderly patients with these conditions.","1981513; ","RO, JIN Y;","ELDADAH, BASIL A.","09/01/2016","05/31/2018","Absence of pain sensation; Achievement; addiction; Adverse effects; Affect; Afferent Neurons; Age; age effect; age related; aged; Aging; Agonist; Analgesics; Androgen Receptor; Androgens; Arthritis; Attenuated; attenuation; Binding Sites; chronic pain; Clinical; Clinical Data; Clinical Research; clinically significant; Custom; cytokine; Data; Degenerative polyarthritis; Development; Dose; Drowsiness; Drug Kinetics; Effectiveness; Elderly; Estrogens; Female; Foundations; Gene Expression; Goals; Gonadal Hormones; high risk; Hormone Receptor; Hyperalgesia; Impairment; Inflammation; injured; insight; Interleukin-1 beta; Investigation; juvenile animal; Knee joint; Knowledge; Link; Maintenance; male; Mediating; men; middle age; Modeling; Molecular; Morphine; multidisciplinary; Nature; Nausea; older patient; Older Population; Opioid; Opioid Analgesics; Opioid Receptor; Pain; Pain management; patient population; Patients; Peripheral; Persistent pain; Persons; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacodynamics; Phenotype; Play; Population; pre-clinical; Pre-Clinical Model; preclinical study; Process; Promoter Regions; Rationalization; Rattus; receptor; receptor expression; receptor function; Regulation; Reporting; response; Rodent Model; Role; Safety; Site; Spinal Ganglia; Testing; Testosterone; therapeutic development; Tissues; Transcription Coactivator; treatment strategy; Up-Regulation; Ursidae Family; Ventilatory Depression; Woman; ","Role of androgens in age-related changes in pain and analgesia","053783","ASG","Aging Systems and Geriatrics Study Section ","","","02","125000","68073","193073",""

The variability of the pulse rate is computed to identify the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF). We propose to enroll 315 patients with symptomatic AF, paroxysmal or persistent, who go through successful radiofrequency ablation or electrical cardioversion. A computer tablet will be used by the subjects at home during 14 days after their procedure to read emails, browse the internet and watch videos. Facial video recordings will be automatically acquired during these daily activities by the tablet device. The subject will be wearing an ECG patch during the follow-up period. The one-lead continuous ECG will be used as a reference to verify the presence of AF rhythm during facial video recordings. The primary aim of the study is to demonstrate the validity and robustness of the video-based technology to detect the presence of AF when facial videos are acquired by the patients at home.","8352211; ","COUDERC, JEAN-PHILIPPE Y;","ITURRIAGA, ERIN ","07/10/2017","06/30/2021","Ablation; Affect; Aging; Anticoagulation; Arrhythmia; Atrial Fibrillation; Blood; Blood Volume; burden of illness; Cardiology; Clinical; clinical practice; cohort; Congestive Heart Failure; cost; cost efficient; Data; Data Set; Detection; Devices; Diagnosis; Diagnostic Procedure; Disease; Disease Progression; Early Diagnosis; Electric Countershock; Electrocardiogram; Electronic Mail; Enrollment; Evaluation; Event; Face; Feasibility Studies; Flushing; follow-up; General Population; Goals; Health; health care service utilization; health economics; Healthcare; Heart; heart rhythm; Home environment; Hospitalization; Hospitals; Hour; improved; Individual; interest; Internet; Lead; Learning; Measures; Modernization; Monitor; mortality; novel; outcome forecast; Patient Monitoring; Patients; Performance; Physicians; Physiologic pulse; Prevalence; Probability; Procedures; Process; Protocols documentation; Pulse Rates; Quality of life; Radiofrequency Catheter Ablation; Radiofrequency Interstitial Ablation; Recurrence; Resources; Risk Factors; Shock; Signal Transduction; Sinus; Skin; skin color; Specificity; Symptoms; Tablet Computer; Tablets; Techniques; Technology; Time; United States; Validation; Variant; Video Recording; Work; ","Home-based videoplethysmographic detection of atrial fibrillation","137617","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","402131","97391","499522",""

We have further found that a critical pathogenic event in  this novel genetic model of pancreatitis is accumulation of p62/SQSTM1 protein, caused by IKK? deletion.

The meeting highlights new data concerning the developmental origins of brain disorders that result from developmental exposure to drugs, toxic substances, environmental contaminants (including food contaminants), stressors, genetic mutations, epigenetic changes, and the interaction of these factors. Effects in humans, animal models, and mechanisms are presented. Issues of validity are considered, as are developments concerning mechanisms of how drugs and other chemicals affect brain development and behavior. The 2013 meeting features new methods and current topics such as the prenatal origins or schizophrenia and brain imaging in understanding normal and abnormal brain development. The meeting brings together developmental neuroscientists, developmental neurotoxicologists, developmental psychologists, developmental epidemiologists, teratologists, developmental toxicologists, medical geneticists, physicians, genetic councilors, and developmental environmental scientists from academia, industry, and government. NBTS meets with the Teratology Society (TS) and the Organization of Teratology Information Specialists (OTIS) interactively. Aim 1: Support Conference Travel Awards for 2 trainees (graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, undergraduates or research assistants) to present their data with waiver of registration and discounted rooms ($700 each x 2). The Society matches this by with 2 awards from its dues for a total of 4 per year. Aim 2: Support one New Investigator Award. The Society waives registration and pays for travel and meeting expenses ($1100 coming from this grant and the balance ($2000-2500) from the Society.

By doing so, we hope to identify a lead candidate for clinical development with the potential to destroy virus-infected cells and to reduce the size of the latent reservoir as a novel therapeutic for HIV eradication.","1858789; ","HO, DAVID D;","SMILEY, STEPHEN T","07/10/2017","06/30/2022","Acute; Adult; Affinity; Antibodies; Antibody -dependent cell cytotoxicity; antibody engineering; antigen binding; antiretroviral therapy; Antiviral Agents; arm; Berlin; Binding; Biological Models; Bispecific Antibodies; Bone Marrow Transplantation; Cathartics; CCR5 gene; cell killing; Cell surface; Cells; chemotherapy; Chronic; Clinical; clinical candidate; clinical development; cohort; Collection; design; Diagnosis; Drug Kinetics; Early treatment; Engineering; Epitopes; experience; experimental study; fighting; France; Goals; HIV; HIV-1; Hour; humanized mouse; IgG1; improved; in vitro activity; in vivo; Infection; Investigation; Killings; Knowledge; Latent Virus; Lead; Libraries; Measures; Mediating; Mississippi; mouse model; Mutation; neutralizing antibody; novel therapeutics; Pathway interactions; Patients; Population; Population Heterogeneity; prevent; Prevention; Property; Proviruses; purge; Research Personnel; screening; Series; Sleep; spatial relationship; Stem cells; Time; Ursidae Family; Viral; viral rebound; Virion; Virus; Virus Diseases; Virus Latency; weapons; Whole-Body Irradiation; ","Bispecific and Trispecific Anti-Env Antibodies for Eliminating HIV Reservoir Cells","129802","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","463315","467131","930446",""

Our results suggest that at least one schistosome TRP channel may be an excellent target for new therapies against schistosomiasis and other parasitic flatworm infections. This project will screen for compounds that affect this channel and test those compounds for their effects on schistosomes.","1882204; ","GREENBERG, ROBERT M;","O'NEIL, MICHAEL T","07/14/2017","06/30/2019","Adolescent; Adult; Affect; Anthelmintics; Antiparasitic Agents; assay development; Biological Assay; Calcium; Capsaicin; Cations; cell motility; Cells; Cessation of life; Childhood; Collection; Common Core; Cues; Dangerousness; Development; Disease; Drug Kinetics; Drug Targeting; egg; Employee Strikes; exhibitions; Exhibits; expectation; experimental study; Family; Female; Future; Genome; Goals; Helminths; high throughput screening; Homeostasis; Human; Hyperactive behavior; Image; imaging study; Impairment; in vitro activity; in vivo; Infection; Inflammatory; Investigation; Ion Channel; Ions; Lead; Libraries; Life Cycle Stages; Light; male; Measures; member; Membrane Proteins; migration; Modeling; Molecular; Morbidity - disease rate; Motor Activity; Mus; neglected tropical diseases; neuromuscular activity; neuromuscular function; neuromuscular system; new therapeutic target; Nociception; novel; novel therapeutics; Parasites; pathogen; Pathway interactions; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacodynamics; Pharmacology; Platyhelminths; Praziquantel; Praziquantel resistance; Production; Property; protein complex; Publishing; receptor; Refractory; Regulation; Reporting; Resiniferatoxin; response; Role; Safety; scaffold; Schistosoma; Schistosoma mansoni; Schistosomiasis; Sensory; sensory stimulus; sensory system; Signal Transduction; Site; small molecule; Structure; Structure-Activity Relationship; Testing; therapeutic target; Tissues; Toxin; trafficking; Tropical Disease; TRPV channel; TRPV1 gene; Vaccines; Vanilloid; Work; ","Discovery of novel antiparasitics that target a pharmacologically atypical schistosome Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) ion channel","132912","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","150000","91500","241500",""

The persistent nature of epigenetic modifications underlies their role in chronic psychiatric diseases, such as addiction and depression.

This technology relies on the collection of magnetic relaxation times (T1 and T2), and is highly sensitive and reliable. The combination of magnetic relaxation and nanotechnology tools has recently led to an uprising of novel diagnostic approaches and disease detection platforms. This work will introduce the combination of these technologies in a fashion not yet seen for the sensitive detection of influenza and investigation of crucial viral binding and fusion mechanisms. Our novel magnetic relaxation nanosensors (MRnS) are synthesized by conjugating targeting epitopes to the surface of superparamagnetic relaxation nanosensors, which allows for the sensitive detection of viral presence as well as binding and fusion activity. We propose the use of the use of this technology to develop nanosensors specific for human, avian, and swine influenzas in addition to the search for anti-viral interventions in the form of entry blockers and fusion inhibitors. In conclusion, this novel technology will allow for the design and fabrication of both prevention, treatment and diagnostic techniques which will aid in the fight against influenza.

The diagnosis and treatment of cancer are extraordinarily demanding and increasingly expensive with major impacts on our economy. Although overall survival from cancer has improved and certain cancers can be prevented or cured, much remains to be accomplished to improve patient outcome through research to develop novel strategies to prevent, diagnose early, and effectively treat this disease. The Dan L.

We will utilize state of the art technologies including techniques to manipulate genes, introducing biological agents to interfere with gene expression, utilization of hormones and carbohydrate-poor dies, small molecules, and sugar-mimics to down-regulate glycogen production. Our research is in a state where we see a clear track to develop effective methods to diagnose, treat, and ultimately cure LD.

Psychosocial factors are increasingly recognized as protective resources as people deal with various types of adversity and life challenge and MIDUS is explaining how and why psychosocial strengths promote resilience by showing their linkages to biological risk factors and brain-based assessments. Importantly, many of these psychosocial factors are modifiable, making them potentially useful targets for prevention and promotion of positive health among U.S. adults.

In this longitudinal panel study of social networks of two cohorts of persos in the United States, it will be possible to see how a person's social networks - and their attendant social support- develop, change, maintain and reorganize as a result of life course changes, such as residential mobility, retirement, illness, marital disruption, and other events.

Nevertheless, the degree to which such associations emerge from environmentally mediated processes amenable to intervention remains largely unknown because existing research cannot rule out the possibility that some of these associations might reflect the impact of confounds, including especially evocative genetic processes, that produce correlations between personality/interpersonal experiences and physical health.

Characterization of this vulnerability - through geriatric assessments of frailty and functional status - and its association with transplant outcomes is critical to identifying older patients with cirrhosis who will and will not benefit fro transplant and improving the care for all older adults with chronic liver disease.","9956988; ","LAI, JENNIFER C.;","ZIEMAN, SUSAN ","09/15/2014","04/30/2019","Address; Adult; Age; Aging; Aging-Related Process; American; Award; Biometry; Blood Tests; California; career; career development; Caring; Cessation of life; Chronic; chronic liver disease; Cirrhosis; Clinical; Clinical assessments; Clinical Investigator; clinical predictors; cohort; Collaborations; Communities; Comorbidity; data registry; Data Set; Demographic Aging; Development Plans; disability; Discipline; Elderly; Epidemic; Evaluation; exhibitions; Exhibits; experience; Fellowship; Foundations; frailty; functional status; Future; Geriatric Assessment; Geriatrics; Gerontology; Goals; Health; Hepatitis; Hepatology; high risk; improved; Individual; Intuition; K-Series Research Career Programs; Knowledge; Laboratories; Leadership; Liver diseases; Liver Failure; liver transplantation; Longitudinal cohort study; Measures; medical specialties; meetings; Mentorship; Modeling; mortality; multidisciplinary; non-alcoholic fatty liver; older patient; Operative Surgical Procedures; Outcome; outcome forecast; parallelization; Patients; Population; programs; Prospective cohort study; public health relevance; Recovery of Function; Research; research and development; Research Personnel; Research Support; Risk; San Francisco; Severity of illness; skills; Standardization; Structure; Supervision; Survival Rate; symposium; Testing; tool; Training; Transplant Recipients; Transplantation; Universities; Waiting Lists; Work; ","Frailty and Functional Status in Older Liver Transplant Patients","048337","ZAG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","04","165179","13214","178393",""

However, little experimental evidence exists regarding the effectiveness of such services in real-world settings, and even less is known about which types of services work best for which types of patients. To answer these questions, a pragmatic randomized trial will be conducted among seriously ill patients admitted to 9 electronically integrated hospitals within the largest nonprofit health system in the U.S., randomly assigning the order in which each hospital switches from a system whereby patients or providers must actively request palliative care consultation, to a system in which such services are ordered by default for selected patients who may choose to opt out.

Although TKA effectively relieves joint pain, it does little to improve objectively-assessed physical functional capacity because of marked reductions in lower extremity neuromuscular function that occur during the early, post-surgical period. The proposed studies are relevant to public health because they seek to define the skeletal muscle adaptations that occur in TKA recipients during this early, post-surgical period and to explore interventions to counteract these adaptations, with the goal of improving physical functional capacity, reducing long-term disability and improving health outcomes in the older adult knee OA population.","1867450; ","TOTH, MICHAEL J;","JOSEPH, LYNDON ","09/01/2016","05/31/2021","Activities of Daily Living; Acute; Address; Adverse effects; Anatomy; Arthralgia; Atrophic; Bone structure; Caring; Clinical; clinical care; clinical practice; Cyclosporine; Data; Detection; Deterioration; disability; Disabled Persons; Early Intervention; Elderly; Event; evidence base; Evidence based intervention; Fiber; Frequencies; functional adaptation; functional disability; Functional disorder; Goals; Growth; Health; Homeostasis; Human; Impairment; improved; indexing; Intervention; Knee Osteoarthritis; knee replacement arthroplasty; Knowledge; Lower Extremity; Measurement; Measures; Methodology; Microfilaments; Mitochondria; Modeling; Molecular; Motivation; Muscle; Muscle Development; Muscle Fibers; Muscle function; muscular structure; Nature; neuroadaptation; neuromuscular function; neuromuscular stimulation; novel; Operative Surgical Procedures; Outcome; Patients; Pharmacology; Physically Handicapped; Plant Roots; Population; prevent; Preventive; Production; Public Health; public health relevance; Randomized; Recovery of Function; Rehabilitation therapy; relating to nervous system; Respiration; response; Role; Scientific Advances and Accomplishments; Seminal; Skeletal Development; Skeletal Muscle; skeletal muscle wasting; Structure; Testing; Thinking; Tissues; ","Skeletal Muscle Atrophy and Dysfunction Following Total Knee Arthroplasty","050305","ASG","Aging Systems and Geriatrics Study Section ","","","02","280858","143317","424175",""

Presently, in clinical practice, older adults with heart failure are instructed to increase exercise which is often overwhelming for those with chronic illness. The purpose of this study is to compare two approaches to help older adults with heart failure increase their physical activity. The first group will concentrate on ways to decrease sedentary behavior and the second group will focus on increasing exercise. The aim of this study is to improve our approach in how we guide patients to become more physically active. The outcome of this study, if reducing sedentary behavior proves to be effective, will help to reframe the approach to focus on sedentary behavior rather then exercise.","9409858; ","BOXER, REBECCA SUE;","ZIEMAN, SUSAN ","09/01/2016","05/31/2018","Accelerometer; Address; Adherence; Adult; adverse outcome; Affect; Aging; American Heart Association; Americas; Behavior; behavior change; Cardiomyopathies; Cardiovascular Diseases; Certification; Chronic Disease; Cities; clinical practice; Control Groups; Data; deconditioning; design; diaries; disability; Elderly; Exercise; exercise program; falls; Fatigue; Feedback; Fracture; functional decline; functional disability; functional loss; Goals; group intervention; Health; Health Care Costs; Health Status; Healthcare Systems; Heart failure; Hour; improved; Incidence; Individual; innovation; insight; Intervention; intervention effect; Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations; Joints; Kansas; Life; Measures; Monitor; mortality; motivational enhancement therapy; new technology; older patient; Outcome; Outcome Study; Outpatients; Patient Education; Patients; Physical activity; Physical Exercise; Physical Performance; Physically Handicapped; Pilot Projects; Population; primary outcome; Process Measure; programs; Publishing; Quality of life; Questionnaires; Randomized; Randomized Controlled Trials; Recommendation; Rest; Risk; Risk Factors; secondary outcome; sedentary; sedentary lifestyle; Self Management; skeletal muscle wasting; Societies; standard of care; success; Symptoms; Syndrome; Teaching Materials; Techniques; Technology; Testing; Time; ","Reducing Sedentary Time in Patients with Heart Failure (ReST-HF)","053413","SPIP","Social Psychology, Personality and Interpersonal Processes Study Section ","","","02","125000","69375","194375",""

A hallmark feature of NMDARs is a developmental switch in receptor subunit composition from primarily NR2B- to NR2A containing during postnatal brain development. The proposed research will identify mechanisms by which epigenetic modifications alter synaptic NMDAR properties during normal and abnormal brain development. Adverse experience in the form of maternal deprivation during the first week of postnatal life has a profound and enduring impact on development and prevents acquisition of the mature NMDAR phenotype at hippocampal synapses. This is significant in that early childhood adversity (maternal deprivation, abuse, neglect, and loss) is a known environmental risk factor in neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia.","1890983; ","ZUKIN, R.

However, our ability to model key aspects of human aging is extremely limited, making it difficult to study the interactions between AD- associated genes, neuropathology, and aging in human cells. To address this challenge and develop new models of AD-associated aging, we propose to manipulate the DNA repair enzymes ERCC1 and ERCC5 in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Using a novel fully-defined protocol, we will then differentiate these cells into microglia and examine the impact of ERCC manipulations on microglial gene expression and function. By combining iPSC modeling, CRISPR-mediated gene editing, RNA-sequencing, and 3D brain organoid culture systems we will determine whether ERCC mutations or deletion drive microglia toward an aged phenotype that impairs homeostatic functions and exacerbates proinflammatory signaling. !","8476224; ","BLURTON-JONES, MATHEW MARK;","WISE, BRADLEY C.","07/15/2017","04/30/2022","Address; Age; age effect; aged; Aging; aging brain; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's disease model; Alzheimer's disease risk; Apoptosis; Astrocytes; Autopsy; Bioinformatics; Blood Vessels; Brain; Cell Differentiation process; Cell model; Cells; Chronology; Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats; Cockayne Syndrome; cytokine; Data; Defect; Deletion Mutation; Development; Disease; DNA; DNA Repair; DNA Repair Enzymes; dopaminergic neuron; ERCC1 gene; exhibitions; Exhibits; Fibroblasts; Gene Deletion; Gene Expression; gene function; Generations; Genes; Genetic study; Genetic Transcription; Goals; Human; Impaired cognition; Impairment; Individual; induced pluripotent stem cell; Inflammatory; Inflammatory Response; innovation; Knock-out; Knockout Mice; Mediating; Methods; Microglia; migration; Modeling; multidisciplinary; Mus; mutant; Mutate; Mutation; nerve stem cell; Neuroglia; Neurologic; Neurologic Signs; Neurologic Symptoms; Neurons; neuropathology; neuroregulation; novel; Oligodendroglia; Organoids; overexpression; Pathogenesis; Pathology; Pathway Analysis; Patients; Phagocytosis; Phenotype; Premature aging syndrome; Production; Progeria; Proteins; Protocols documentation; Reactive Oxygen Species; relating to nervous system; Research Personnel; Resources; response; Risk Factors; Role; Signal Transduction; Source; Stimulus; stroke; Superoxides; Syndrome; System; Testing; Tissues; Transcript; transcriptome; transcriptome sequencing; Transgenic Organisms; young adult; ","Manipulating DNA repair enzymes to examine the interactions between aging and Alzheimers disease with iPSC-derived microglia","056303","ZAG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","250000","136250","386250",""

The underlying hypothesis of this proposal is that B. burgdorferi possesses a functionally redundant arsenal of immune evasion lipoproteins which specifically target and inactivate the complement classical pathway.

We also found that this protective pathway breaks down in response to long-term excessive alcohol drinking. Here we plan to understand the mechanisms underlying the actions of the valuable action of BDNF as well as the mechanisms that lead to, and result from, it breaking down. We will also test the hypothesis that the level and/or function of BDNF determines whether subjects are at risk to develop alcohol abuse disorders.

In our previous research we developed an Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), a device that that has the advantage that it does not rely on self-report and can automatically and reliably detect food intake, estimate the mass and the energy content of ingested food. The information provided by AIM can be used to improve behavioral weight loss strategies or to develop new kinds of weight loss interventions.

Despite the extraordinarily high and growing rates of migration globally, healthcare systems in both sending and receiving countries have not yet developed the capacities to respond to the chronic NCDs associated with migration. The proposed research training focuses on chronic NCDs across the lifespan in the areas of mental illness (e.g. depression, anxiety, PTSD, and substance abuse) and physical comorbidities (e.g., cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and occupational diseases). The overall aim of this application is to build research capacity in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) concerning the major global health problem of migration-related NCDs. It focuses on migration in Eastern Europe and Central Asia from two of the world's highest migrant sending countries, Kosovo and Tajikistan. This grant supports the University of Illinois at Chicago to work with leading research institutions in Kosovo and Tajikistan to train postdoctoral researchers and build centers of expertise in NCD research that will be part of a Chicago-Prishtina-Dushanbe Network (CPDN). This research will improve the abilities of policymakers, practitioners, and educators in Kosovo and Tajikistan to deal with migration-associated mental illness and physical comorbidities for their adult and child citizens both at home and abroad. It will do so by developing a cadre of research experts and national research centers of expertise that can contribute regionally and globally to addressing the problem of chronic NCDs in migration-impacted populations.","2503213; ","WEINE, STEVAN MERRILL;","MICHELS, KATHLEEN M","06/01/2014","05/31/2019","Address; Anxiety; Area; Behavioral; Cardiovascular Diseases; career; Caring; Central Asia; Cerebrovascular Disorders; Chicago; Chronic; Clinical; Comorbidity; Complex; Country; Eastern Europe; Ecology; Epigenetic Process; Evaluation; Family; global health; Grant; Health Services Research; Home environment; Illinois; improved; In-Migration; Institution; interdisciplinary approach; International; Intervention; Knowledge; Kosovo; low and middle-income countries; meetings; Mental Depression; Mental disorders; Mentors; migration; Muslim population group; Nature; Nomads; novel strategies; Occupational Diseases; Participant; post-doctoral training; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders; Prevention; Psyche structure; Research; Research Infrastructure; Research Methodology; Research Personnel; Research Project Grants; Research Training; resilience; Risk; Science; skills; Social Sciences; Substance abuse problem; Tajikistan; Training; Training Programs; Universities; Work; ","Addressing Mental Illness and Physical Comorbidities in Migrants and Their Famili","009316","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","04","271066","17573","288639",""

Many types of anemia in disorders such as myelodysplasia, leukemia, thalassemia, sideroblastic anemia, and anemia of inflammation are due to defects in red cell maturation and do not respond to treatment with the red cell hormone erythropoietin (Epo). The development of novel alternative treatments for these Epo-refractory anemias is limited by our incomplete understanding of crucial processes of late red cell development. In our preliminary work, we found that the removal of proteins from the nucleus is essential for one of these processes-the compaction of DNA-and the proposed experiments in this study will help us understand how this process occurs and how it is controlled.","8649743; ","HATTANGADI, SHILPA MANOHAR;","BISHOP, TERRY ROGERS","09/01/2014","06/30/2018","Affect; alternative treatment; American; Anemia; Anemia due to Chronic Disorder; Apoptosis; Binding; Biological; Biological Process; biological systems; CD34 gene; Cell Culture System; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell Maturation; Cell Nucleus; Cell Size; Cells; Chickens; Chromatin; Chromatography; Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia; Cytoplasm; Defect; Development; Diamond-Blackfan anemia; Disease; DNA; DNA Maintenance; DNA-Binding Proteins; Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes; Erythroblasts; Erythrocytes; Erythroid; Erythropoiesis; Erythropoietin; Evaluation; Excision; experimental study; Exportins; Fetal Liver; gain of function; Goals; Hematological Disease; Hemoglobin; Heterochromatin; Histone H2A; Histones; Hormones; Human; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; inhibitor/antagonist; insight; knock-down; Knockout Mice; Knowledge; Laboratories; leukemia; Light; loss of function; Mammals; Manuscripts; Microscopy; Modeling; Molecular; mouse model; Mus; Myelogenous; novel; Nuclear; Nuclear Export; Nuclear Protein; Nuclear Proteins; Phenotype; Physical condensation; Play; prevent; Process; progenitor; programs; promoter; Protamines; Protein Export Pathway; Proteins; Proteomics; public health relevance; Red Blood Cell Count measurement; Refractory anemias; Role; Sideroblastic Anemia; Spermatids; Structural Protein; Substrate Specificity; Thalassemia; tool; transcription factor; Transcriptional Regulation; Transfusion; Transplantation; Vertebrates; Work; ","Elucidating the Role of Nuclear Protein Export in Erythroid Nuclear Condensation","102889","MCH","Molecular and Cellular Hematology Study Section ","","","04","200000","133000","333000",""

Deregulation of HSC self-renewal leads to cancer or tissue degeneration. The tremendous potential of HSC to reconstitute the hematopoietic system has allowed the development of clinical HSC transplantation to treat a wide variety of diseases, including bone marrow failure or leukemias. The success of HSC transplantation is however limited due to our inability to control HSC functions. The studies proposed in this application will provide important information of cooperative roles of stress signaling pathways and mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in the regulation of HSC self-renewal. Therefore, our study will guide designing strategies to modulate HSC functions via small molecule inhibitors that could be used in the future to device new therapeutic approaches of clinical HSC transplantation protocols.","8470795 (contact); 6878512; ","FILIPPI, MARIE-DOMINIQUE  (contact); MALIK, PUNAM ;","BISHOP, TERRY ROGERS","07/01/2015","06/30/2019","Activities of Daily Living; Affect; Applications Grants; autocrine; Biological Assay; Blood; Blood Cells; CD34 gene; Cell division; Cell physiology; Cell Respiration; Cell Therapy; Cells; Clinical; clinical development; cost; Cytokine Signaling; Daughter; design; Development; Devices; Disease; Engraftment; Equilibrium; Failure; fitness; Functional disorder; functional outcomes; Future; Genetic; Goals; GTPase-Activating Proteins; Hematological Disease; Hematopoiesis; Hematopoietic; hematopoietic stem cell fate; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Hematopoietic stem cells; Hematopoietic System; Human; In Vitro; in vivo; inhibitor/antagonist; innovation; insight; Intervention; knock-down; Knock-out; Knowledge; Lead; leukemia; Life; Ligands; Link; Malignant Neoplasms; MAPK14 gene; Mediating; Mitochondria; mitochondrial fitness; mitochondrial metabolism; Modeling; Mus; Natural regeneration; novel; novel therapeutic intervention; novel therapeutics; Organelles; overexpression; Oxidative Stress; Pancytopenia; Pathway interactions; Pharmacology; prevent; Process; Production; Protocols documentation; public health relevance; reconstitution; regenerative; Regenerative Medicine; Regulation; Regulatory Element; Regulatory Pathway; Reporting; rho; rho GTP-Binding Proteins; rho GTPase-activating protein; Role; self-renewal; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Signaling Protein; small molecule inhibitor; stem cell biology; Stem cells; Stress; success; Testing; TGFB1 gene; Therapeutic; tissue degeneration; Transforming Growth Factor beta; Transplantation; Work; Xenograft procedure; ","Regulation of hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal by GTPase activating protein signaling","102890","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","03","273264","143056","416320",""

Prior research indicates stigma, a lack of social support, and structural barriers often prohibit those testing HI positive during HBHCT from accessing care. This project aims to reduce these barriers through an intervention in which counselors help facilitate access to HIV care and treatment, as well as to social support. This intervention, previously tested in an urban Ugandan setting, is enhanced in the current proposal to increase its impact on multiple outcomes in a rural Ugandan setting. This may be a cost effective approach to help patients access care which ultimately reduces mortality rates, improves treatment outcomes, and through its effect on HIV viral load, decreases the likelihood of transmitting HIV to others.","7970713 (contact); 11020870; ","KIENE, SUSAN MARIA (contact); WANYENZE, RHODA KITTI;","GORDON, CHRISTOPHER M.","07/28/2015","06/30/2020","Address; Adult; Africa South of the Sahara; African; AIDS prevention; AIDS/HIV problem; Anti-Retroviral Agents; antiretroviral therapy; arm; Awareness; behavioral outcome; Botswana; care seeking; care systems; Caring; Client; Clinic; Clinic Visits; Cluster randomized trial; Communities; compare effectiveness; Continuity of Patient Care; cost; cost effective; cost effectiveness; Counseling; Country; Data; Disclosure; Disease; Effectiveness of Interventions; Eligibility Determination; Epidemic; follow-up; Health care facility; Health Services Accessibility; HIV; HIV Infections; HIV Seropositivity; Home environment; Home visitation; Hospital Referrals; Human immunodeficiency virus test; improved; Individual; Inpatients; Intervention; intervention effect; Intervention Studies; Intervention Trial; Kenya; Link; Malawi; Mediating; men; Modality; mortality; Natural History; novel strategies; Opportunistic Infections; Outcome; Outcome Study; Paper; Participant; patient home care; Patients; Persons; Population; Prevention; Prevention program; Professional counselor; programs; Prophylactic treatment; Provider; Public Health; public health relevance; Randomized; randomized trial; Research; Rural; Services; social stigma; Social support; standard of care; Testing; Time; Travel; Treatment outcome; Uganda; Urbanization; Viral; Viral Load result; Woman; ","Enhanced Linkage to HIV Care Following Home-Based HIV Testing in Rural Uganda","106391","BSCH","Behavioral and Social Consequences of HIV/AIDS Study Section ","","","03","452161","106133","558294",""

Cocaine, often abused by HIV-infected individuals, exacerbates the severity and/or disease progression of HAND, and shares common drug transport and metabolic pathways that may interfere with the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy in the central nervous system. By examining the mechanisms by which cocaine alters the drug transport pathways that mediate antiretroviral influx and retention in the brain, this work may inform and guide dosing strategies for HIV infected drug abusers and also contribute to HIV eradication by limiting the brain as a viral reservoir.","9132016; ","WILLIAMS, DIONNA WHITNEY;","LIN, YU ","07/15/2017","06/30/2019","Address; Affect; Anti-Retroviral Agents; antiretroviral therapy; Area; Autopsy; Award; Blood - brain barrier anatomy; Brain; brain parenchyma; Bypass; career development; cellular targeting; Characteristics; Cocaine; cocaine use; Cocaine Users; Cognitive deficits; cognitive function; Comorbidity; Consequences of HIV; CYP3A4 gene; Cytochrome P450; Dementia; Development; Disease Progression; Dose; Drug abuser; Drug Efflux; Drug Transport; Effectiveness; Ensure; Enteral; Environment; Enzymes; exhibitions; Exhibits; experience; Family; Foundations; Genetic; Genetic Polymorphism; Goals; HIV; HIV antiretroviral; HIV Infections; HIV-1; HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder; Human; Image; Impaired cognition; Incidence; Individual; Innate Immune Response; Institutionalization; International; Life Expectancy; Local Therapy; Macaca; macrophage; Mass Spectrum Analysis; Mediating; meetings; Mentorship; Metabolic Pathway; Metabolism; Methodology; Microglia; Minor; Modality; Modeling; Molecular Biology; Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins; Neuraxis; neuroinflammation; Neurologic; Neurons; Neuropathogenesis; non-drug; OATP Transporters; P-Glycoprotein; pandemic disease; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Peripheral; Permeability; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacogenetics; Pharmacology; Phase; Plasma; Prevalence; Primary Infection; programs; Quality of life; Research; research and development; Research Personnel; Resources; response; Risk; RNA Interference; Series; seropositive; Severities; SIV; skills; Spatial Distribution; Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization; Substance abuse problem; substance abuser; Therapeutic; therapeutic target; Training; Treatment Efficacy; Universities; Viral Load result; Viral reservoir; Viremia; Virus; Virus Replication; Work; ","Cocaine Use and HIV Antiretroviral Therapy Efficacy in the CNS","044838","ZDA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","127545","10204","137749",""

A better understanding of the underlying risk factors for disability following critical illness is greatly needed, including the effect that activity during hospitalization may have on these outcomes. Therefore, we designed the Measuring OutcomeS of Activity in Intensive Care (MOSAIC) observational study to evaluate the relationship between activity (measured more rigorously than in prior investigations) and disability, physical function, and cognitive function in survivors of critical illness 3 and 12 months after ICU discharge.","11121833; ","BRUMMEL, NATHAN E;","ZIEMAN, SUSAN ","09/30/2016","05/31/2021","Academic Medical Centers; Activities of Daily Living; Acute; Address; Adult; Age; Aging; American; Anti-inflammatory; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Biological; Biological Markers; Biometry; Blood Coagulation Disorders; C-reactive protein; career; career development; Caring; Chronic; Clinical; Clinical Management; Clinical Research; clinical risk; Clinical Trials; Coagulation Process; Cognition; cognitive function; Conflict (Psychology); Critical Care; Critical Illness; daily functioning; Data; Delirium; design; Development Plans; disability; Disease; Elderly; Enrollment; Environment; executive function; Face; Fibrin fragment D; follow-up; Foundations; Functional disorder; Funding; Future; Geriatrics; Gerontology; Goals; health care service utilization; health related quality of life; Hospitalization; Hospitals; human old age (65+); Immobilization; Impaired cognition; Impairment; improved; Inflammation; inflammatory marker; Institutes; instructor; instrumental activity of daily living; Intensive Care; Intensive Care Units; Interleukin-10; Interleukin-6; Interleukins; International; Intervention; Investigation; Lead; Leadership; Life; Longitudinal Studies; Low Prevalence; Measurement; Measures; Mediating; Medical; Medicine; Mentors; Modeling; Morbidity - disease rate; Motor; Multicenter Trials; muscle strength; neuromuscular; novel; Observational Study; Organ; Outcome; Outcome Measure; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Patients; Physical activity; Physical Function; Physical Performance; Physicians; prevent; Process; programs; Public Health; Publications; Randomized Controlled Trials; randomized trial; Research; Research Project Grants; Resolution; Risk Factors; Scientist; Self Care; Series; Severities; skills; Survivors; Testing; tool; Training; Translational Research; United States National Institutes of Health; ","Long Term Outcomes of Physical Activity in Older Adults with Critical Illness","054864","ZAG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","161274","12770","174044",""

The endogenous opioid peptide system can be modulated through various anti-opioid peptide systems (ie. cholecystokinin and Neuropeptide FF). We have identified lead compounds (both agonist and antagonist) for the opioid modulating system, Neuropeptide FF. Study of this proposed anti-opioid system and its role in drug abuse and addiction (as well as other putative pharmacologies) has been hampered due to the lack of stable, non-peptide probes for pharmacological study. Our validated hits are amenable to structural modification to provide the first non-peptide probes for this system. It has been demonstrated in the literature that blockade of this endogenous system will alleviate opioid tolerance and opioid induced hyperalgesia. It is of high significance to provide the research community with suitable in vivo probes to fully characterize the pharmacology associated with the NPFF system. Ultimately, these probes may be developed to allow for lower doses of clinically utilized opioids to lessen the chance of the development of tolerance and addiction.","3131537; ","MCCURDY, CHRISTOPHER R;","HILLERY, PAUL ","04/19/2017","08/31/2017","","Optimization of non-peptide probes for the NPFF receptor system","034777","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","04","325758","163483","489241",""

Our recent studies reveal that pancreatitis causes profound disordering of autophagy, the key cellular mechanism for protein degradation, and of lysosomes, the organelles that execute autophagy. This proposal will use experimental and genetic pancreatitis models in mice and isolated pancreatic cells to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying this defect. We propose that pancreatitis causes global dysfunction of Rab GTPases, an important class of proteins which control trafficking between various cellular organelles; and further, that Rab dysfunction leads to key pathologic responses of pancreatitis such as inflammation and cell death. Insights gained from proposed studies will advance our understanding of the mechanism of pancreatitis and lead to novel molecular targets for treatment of this disease.","6713448; ","GUKOVSKAYA, ANNA S;","","","","Ablation; Acinar Cell; acute pancreatitis; AGFG1 gene; Autophagocytosis; Biochemical; Biological; Carrier Proteins; Cathepsins; Cell Death; Cells; Data; Defect; Disease; Dominant-Negative Mutation; effective therapy; Endosomes; Event; Exocrine pancreas; Experimental Genetics; Experimental Models; Functional disorder; Genetic; Goals; Guanosine Triphosphate; Human; human disease; Hydrolase; IGF Type 2 Receptor; Impairment; in vivo; Inflammation; insight; knock-down; Lead; Link; Lipids; Lysosomes; Mediating; Membrane; Modeling; Molecular; Molecular Target; molecular targeted therapies; Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; mouse model; Mus; novel; Organelles; overexpression; Pancreas; Pancreatitis; Pathogenesis; Pathogenicity; Pathologic; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Peptide Hydrolases; prenylation; prevent; protein degradation; protein transport; Proteins; Publishing; Rab escort protein; Rab geranylgeranyltransferase; rab GTP-Binding Proteins; Recruitment Activity; Recycling; response; Role; small hairpin RNA; System; Techniques; Testing; Therapeutic Intervention; trafficking; Transmembrane Transport; Trypsin; Trypsinogen; Vacuole; vector; ","Dysfunction of Rab GTPases in Pancreatitis","098108","ZDK1","Special Emphasis Panel ","5660","","04","173360","45074","","218434"

Brain cells of the neurovascular unit are located around the vasculature, sense changes in energy demands of the brain, and produce inflammatory substances that regulate local blood flow and homeostasis. We propose experiments to determine the role of sleep loss on inflammation in cells of the neurovascular unit, which will have practical application to understand mechanisms that will allow for future pharmaceutical treatments and strategies for veterans and individuals with dysregulated sleep and brain damage.","10958199; ","ZIELINSKI, MARK ROBERT;","","07/01/2016","06/30/2021","Adenosine; Affect; analog; Area; Astrocytes; Blood flow; Boston; Brain; brain cell; Brain Injuries; CASP1 gene; cell type; Cells; Cerebrovascular Circulation; Cleaved cell; Cognition; Cognition Disorders; Communities; Development; Disease; Drowsiness; Electroencephalogram; Encephalitis; Ensure; Environment; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; experience; experimental study; extracellular; Fatigue; Flow Cytometry; Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting; Future; General Population; Genes; Goals; Health; Healthcare Systems; Homeostasis; Hypothalamic structure; immune function; Immunohistochemistry; Immunologics; Impaired cognition; Impairment; Individual; Inflammasome; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Infusion procedures; inorganic phosphate; Interleukin-1 beta; Interleukin-1 Receptors; K-Series Research Career Programs; Laser-Doppler Flowmetry; Leucine; Link; Literature; macrophage; Memory; Memory impairment; Mentors; Mentorship; Microglia; Microspheres; Molecular; Mus; Neurons; Neurosciences; neurovascular unit; novel; Nucleotides; Pathogenicity; Pathology; Pharmacologic Substance; Pharmacology; Physiological; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Polysomnography; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders; Postdoctoral Fellow; practical application; Prevalence; Process; Productivity; protein complex; Proteins; public health relevance; Purines; Quality of life; receptor; recombinase-mediated cassette exchange; Research; response; Role; Schizophrenia; Scientist; Sleep; Sleep Architecture; Sleep Deprivation; Sleep Disorders; Sleep disturbances; Sleeplessness; Somatosensory Cortex; Spectrophotometry; Subfamily lentivirinae; Techniques; Testing; Time; Training; Transgenic Mice; Traumatic Brain Injury; treatment strategy; Vascular resistance; Veterans; Western Blotting; ","Sleep Loss and Inflammation in the Neurovascular Unit","002823","NURR","Neurobiology R ","","","02","","","",""

The SGLT2 inhibitor class of drugs is a new class of glucose-regulating agents, which improves glucose control in persons with diabetes by allowing the excess glucose to be excreted in the urine. However, these drugs appear to also further increase the risk of fractures in diabetic patients; therefore, the objectives of this proposal are to study the mechanisms contributing to the increased fracture risk in persons receiving these medications.","8906382; 1919059 (contact); ","NYMAN, JEFFRY STEPHEN; THRAILKILL, KATHRYN M (contact);","ALEKEL, D.

In particular, deregulation of embryonic transcriptional programs is frequently observed in pediatric cancers. Hox genes are essential regulators of bone development. In this proposal we will develop new models to investigate how deregulation of Hox genes in bone stem cells leads to the creation Ewing sarcoma, an aggressive pediatric bone cancer. These developmental models will be innovative tools for future studies of tumor biology and testing of new biologically-targeted, anti-cancer therapies.","8554243 (contact); 1889947; ","LAWLOR, ELIZABETH R.

In livin patients, it is almost always misdiagnosed as Alzheimer's disease, or similar neurodegenerative disorder. ALSP encompasses two similar diseases previously known as hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids (HDLS) and familial pigmentary orthochromatic leukodystrophy (POLD). The disease was recently shown to be caused by loss of function of one copy of the gene encoding colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R). This receptor mediates signals from two protein hormones CSF- 1 and IL-34, that we have shown are made by different subsets of mature neurons. CSF-1 and IL-34 control the survival, development and multiplication of two types of brain cells, microglia and neurons. Microglia are non-neuronal brain-resident cells that play critical roles in brain development, support brain function and mediate recovery from infection and injury. It is not known whether developmental deficits contribute to ALSP, nor whether the loss of one copy of the CSF-1R gene in neurons, or the microglia, is most critical for disease development. Furthermore, there are no effective treatment options for ALSP. We have developed a mouse model of ALSP by deleting one copy of the CSF-1R gene. This model, which mimics the human disease, will enable these questions to be addressed and novel treatment approaches to be tested. The proposed studies are highly relevant, not only for our understanding of ALSP, but also to other neurodegenerative disorders, in which neuron survival and microglial function are critical.","1897243; ","STANLEY, E.

Item 8. Project Narrative/Public Health Relevance The proposed training program is relevant to the public health because injuries that workers sustain on the job have important implications for their lives outside of work, including their financial situation (Foley et al. 2007), as well as implications for costs incurred by states, employers, and other entities (Dembe 2001, Weil 2001, Costich 2010). Workers who either permanently or temporarily cannot perform their occupational tasks may also not be able to perform tasks at home, including caregiving tasks for children or for a parent or other family member who requires support in order to remain living in a private setting, rather than an institution (Franche et al. 2006); extra burdens on family members may result in them developing musculoskeletal disorders and incurring associated healthcare costs (Asfaw et al. 2015). Engineers have the power to affect the health and safety of workers, but an appreciation of this requires special training and education, such as that provided through our Master's level Training Program in Safety & Ergonomics, in order to increase their ability to exert positive effects on worker safety and health; thus the relevance of this program to the public health.","1875100; ","SOMMERICH, CAROLYN M;","MAPLES, ELIZABETH ","07/01/2016","06/30/2021","","Occupational Safety and Health Training Grant : MS ISE/ Safety and Ergonomics","008847","ZOH1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","S2","12","","","17018",""

This project will also evaluate evidence for the effectiveness of delivery of online training for the hospital workforce.","1971697 (contact); 1865206; ","HOBDAY, JOHN V (contact); MITTELMAN, MARY SHERMAN;","PLUDE, DANA JEFFREY","08/01/2013","05/31/2018","Acute; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer's Disease; Americas; Attitude; Award; Awareness; burnout; Caregivers; Caring; certificate program; Certification; Cessation of life; Chronic; Clinic; Clip; Collaborations; commercialization; Communication; Communities; Competence; Control Groups; control trial; Cost of Illness; Data; Data Analyses; Dementia; dementia care; design; Development; Diagnosis; Diet; Discipline of Nursing; Dropout; Educational Curriculum; Effectiveness; Employee; Enrollment; Environment; Evaluation; Evaluation Research; Family member; Feedback; Focus Groups; follow-up; Health; Healthcare; Home environment; Hospitalization; Hospitals; Hour; Human Resources; Illness Days; improved; Individual; Intake; Internet; Intervention; Interview; Job Satisfaction; Knowledge; Life; Literature; Long-Term Care; Measurable; Measures; Medical; Medical center; member; multidisciplinary; Nurses; Occupations; Online Systems; Outcome; Palliative Care; Participant; person centered; Persons; Phase; Physicians' Offices; Pilot Projects; Play; Population; prevent; Productivity; Program Evaluation; prototype; Public Health; public health relevance; Publishing; Randomized; Randomized Controlled Trials; Recruitment Activity; Reporting; Research; Research Personnel; Resources; Review Literature; Risk; Role; Rural; rural area; Sampling; Schools; Secure; self esteem; skills training; Small Business Innovation Research Grant; Standardization; Stress; Symptoms; Technology; Testing; TimeLine; Training; Training Activity; Training and Education; Training Programs; Transportation; United States; urban area; Urbanization; urgent care; Waiting Lists; Work; ","Online Training & Certification for Competency in Dementia Friendly Hospital Care","044019","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","03","","","559562",""

Through its regular meetings and public workshops, the Forum provides a venue where its members, other leaders from the neurosciences and related disciplines (e.g. social sciences, behavioral health, engineering, computer science, and mathematics), and members of the public can have candid discussions about issues of mutual interest. The Forum convenes two or three times a year to confer on subject areas of mutual interest and concern and organizes and hosts two to four public workshops each year. The Forum has undertaken a broad set of initiatives. These activities included roundtable meetings on U.S. and European animal-research regulations and their impact on neuroscience research, grand challenges in neurosciences, animal models for CNS research, and models to facilitate first in human research.","15022370; ","POSEY NORRIS, SHEENA MARIA;","","07/15/2015","07/14/2020","","FORUM ON NEUROSCIENCE AND NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS","005362","ZFD1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","03","","","35000",""

However, a lack of spatiotemporal information of PMIs in their different oxidation states within living bacterial cells is a major barrier for studying this field known as nutritional immunity. We will overcome this barrier by developing and validating DNAzyme-based turn-on fluorescent sensors for simultaneous selective detection not only for different PMIs, but also for different oxidation states of the same PMI, and thus providing deeper insight into the uptake and homeostasis of PMIs in bacteria and the role of metal ions in pathogenesis, which can form a strong scientific basis in our effort to find novel strategies to fight against bacterial infection.","8066634; ","LU, YI ;","ANDERSON, VERNON ","07/15/2017","04/30/2021","absorption; Affect; Affinity; Antibiotic Resistance; Bacteria; Bacterial Infections; Binding; Biochemical; Biological Models; biophysical analysis; biophysical properties; catalyst; Catalytic DNA; Cells; Cleaved cell; combat; Complex; Conserved Sequence; cost; Cytosol; Dependence; design; Detection; Development; DNA; Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy; Elements; Escherichia coli; field study; fight against; flexibility; Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer; fluorophore; functional group; Goals; Health; Heavy Ions; high risk; Homeostasis; Host Defense Mechanism; Human; Immunity; improved; In Vitro; Infection; insight; interest; Ions; Iron; Knowledge; Legal patent; Length; Life; Link; Manganese; Measurement; Metal Ion Binding; Metals; Methods; Modeling; Molecular Conformation; Monitor; Mutagenesis; Neurodegenerative Disorders; next generation sequencing; novel; novel strategies; Nucleotides; Nutritional; Organism; Outcome; oxidation; Oxidative Stress; Oxidative Stress Pathway; pathogen; Pathogenesis; pathogenic bacteria; Pathway interactions; Performance; periplasm; Phagocytes; prevent; Process; Public Health; Randomized; ratiometric; Regulation; Respiratory Burst; Role; Sampling; sensor; Signal Transduction; Site; Site-Directed Mutagenesis; spatiotemporal; Specificity; Staphylococcus aureus; Starvation; stoichiometry; System; Technology; three dimensional structure; Time; Titrations; tool; uptake; Validation; X-Ray Crystallography; ","Selection and sensing applications of DNAzymes selective for paramagnetic metal ions","124316","MSFA","Macromolecular Structure and Function A Study Section ","","","01","195000","87598","282598",""

Although ERAP is as an important editor of the MHC I peptide repertoire, it remains to be explained how ERAP exerts its peptide trimming function. Beyond this fundamental role, there is a strong interest in ERAP because of its genetic linkage to autoimmune diseases, such as the HLA-B27-associated ankylosing spondylitis. How ERAP is functionally linked with chronic diseases, and how ERAP interacts with disease-associated MHC class I molecules, are still unanswered questions. It is absolutely essential to characterize the role and function of key components of the class I antigen presentation pathway to understand how the human immune system provides a first and effective line of defenses against invading pathogens.

The aims of this proposal are to elucidate details of this ?-catenin- mediated exclusion-process, to interrogate whether other oncogenic pathways contribute to the exclusion of T cells in melanoma and other cancers, and to identify therapeutic solutions to overcome this barrier to effective immunotherapy.","12309612; ","SPRANGER, STEFANI ;","MCCARTHY, SUSAN A.","07/12/2017","06/30/2020","Address; beta catenin; Biological Markers; Bypass; cancer type; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; CD8B1 gene; chemokine; Clinical; clinical efficacy; clinical predictors; Clinical Research; clinical translation; Colon Carcinoma; combinatorial; Data; Dendritic Cells; Event; Exclusion; experimental study; Gene Targeting; Genetic Engineering; genetic signature; Genetically Engineered Mouse; Genomics; Goals; Head and Neck Cancer; Human; Immune; Immune checkpoint blockade; Immune response; Immune system; Immunity; Immunologics; Immunotherapeutic agent; Immunotherapy; Infiltration; Inflammation; insight; Intervention; Laboratories; malignant breast neoplasm; Malignant neoplasm of lung; Malignant neoplasm of pancreas; Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; melanoma; Melanoma Cell; Modality; Modeling; Molecular; mouse model; Mus; neoplastic cell; Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma; novel; novel therapeutic intervention; Oncogenes; Oncogenic; Outcome; Pathway interactions; Patients; Population; prevent; Process; public health relevance; Recruitment Activity; Regulation; Resistance; response; Role; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Site; Solid Neoplasm; T cell response; T cell therapy; T-Cell Activation; T-Lymphocyte; Testing; Therapeutic; therapeutic target; trafficking; treatment strategy; triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma; tumor; Tumor Biology; Tumor Escape; Tumor Immunity; tumor microenvironment; Work; ","Tumor-intrinsic oncogenic alterations and evasion of anti-tumor immunity","204595","NSS","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","03","160957","88043","249000",""

Early onset of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the major causes of lupus-associated mortality. In patients with lupus, antibodies against autoantigen correlate with carotid  atherosclerosis. Autoantigen-autoantibody complexes (also known as immune complexes) to Fc? receptors expressed by inflammatory cells resulting in uncontrolled inflammation. The inflammatory responses can feed into promoting atherosclerosis. Interestingly, Fc? receptor polymorphism has been implicated with lupus as well as cardiovascular disease independently. Combination of lupus, Fc? receptor polymorphism and elevated cholesterol levels could cause more damage to blood vessels. In this application we will investigate the causal link between lupus, Fc? receptors and atherosclerosis. We expect to understand mechanism contributing to increased morbidity associated with patients with lupus.

Using a national database on physician characteristics, measures of social and practice networks, and clinical registry data linked to Medicare claims data, we seek to understand why some healthcare providers are better able to adopt high-quality care quickly - and use it effectively - and why some healthcare providers instead adopt the most costly and least effective treatments.","1864269; ","SKINNER, JONATHAN S;","BHATTACHARYYA, PARTHA ","09/30/2013","05/31/2018","Adopted; Adverse effects; adverse outcome; Age; Amputation; Anticoagulants; Antidiabetic Drugs; Area; Atrial Fibrillation; Back; bed capacity; Beds; Belief; blood glucose regulation; Blood Tests; Blood Vessels; Cardiac; Cardiovascular Diseases; cardiovascular risk factor; Carotid Endarterectomy; Categories; Characteristics; Clinical; cost; Cross-Sectional Studies; Data; data registry; Databases; Deep Vein Thrombosis; diabetic; diabetic patient; Diffuse; Diffusion; Drops; effective therapy; Ethnic group; exhibitions; Exhibits; Expenditure; experience; falls; Fee-for-Service Plans; Glycosylated hemoglobin A; Growth; Health; Health Care Costs; Health Personnel; Healthcare; Hospitals; illegal behavior; Immunoglobulins; Implantable Defibrillators; Individual; Infusion procedures; Intensive Care Units; Link; Masks; Measures; Medical; medical schools; medical specialties; Medicare; Medicare claim; Monitor; motivated behavior; Neuropathy; Operative Surgical Procedures; organizational structure; Outcome; Patient Selection; Patients; Pattern; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Physicians; Population; Process; Provider; public health relevance; Publications; Quality of Care; Race; randomized trial; rapid growth; Registries; Research; Residencies; Retinal Diseases; Retreatment; Risk; rosiglitazone; social; Social Network; Speed; Stents; Structure; Subgroup; System; Technology; technology diffusion; Testing; Treatment Cost; treatment group; Variant; ","Technology Diffusion, Health Outcomes, and Healthcare Expenditures","046830","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","05","481822","227013","708835",""

We propose to study biomechanistic GABA receptor modulation effects of FDA-approved medications (flumazenil and clarithromycin) on gait and balance motor impairments in subjects with Parkinson disease.","8609967; ","BOHNEN, NICOLAAS IDA;","SIEBER, BETH-ANNE ","07/15/2017","04/30/2021","Antibiotics; Area; Attention; Basal Ganglia; Benzodiazepine Receptor; Binding Sites; Biological Markers; Biological Neural Networks; Brain; Cell Nucleus; Cerebrum; Clarithromycin; Clinical Trials; Data; disability; Dissociation; Dopamine; Dose; Equilibrium; experimental study; extracellular; falls; FDA approved; Flumazenil; Functional disorder; Future; GABA Modulators; GABA Receptor; GABA-A Receptor; Gait; gamma-Aminobutyric Acid; Goals; Hour; Human; Impairment; improved; improving mobility; In Vitro; in vivo; interest; Intravenous; Macrolide Antibiotics; Mediating; Modeling; Motor; motor function improvement; motor impairment; motor symptom; Nature; Nerve; neurotransmission; Neurotransmitters; nigrostriatal system; nonhuman primate; novel; Oral; Parkinson Disease; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacotherapy; Placebos; Play; Positron-Emission Tomography; posture instability; receptor; Recruitment Activity; reduce symptoms; Research; Research Priority; Resistance; Role; Severity of illness; Structure; symptom treatment; Synapses; System; Testing; vesicular monoamine transporter; ","Modulation of GABA-A Receptors and Axial Motor Impairments in Parkinson Disease","099535","CNN","Clinical Neuroscience and Neurodegeneration Study Section ","","A1","01","340291","187160","527451",""

The major problem in PAD is lack of blood supply to the legs, which results in leg pain during walking or leg pain at rest with or without ulcers. Patients with rest pin have a 25-40% risk of major amputation in six months, and an annual mortality risk as high as 20%. Despite a prevalence and mortality similar to that of coronary artery disease, the field of PAD has been understudied. There is no definite treatment to improve blood flow to the diseased legs, and no bio-marker to aid in early diagnosis or risk stratification for patients with PAD. This study will seek to better understand the modulators of PAD, and to investigate for potential bio-markers and/or prognostic markers for PAD. The first aim will investigate: 'How do cells regulate micro-RNAs, key modulators of gene expression in the context of peripheral arterial disease (PAD)'? We will use cell culture models to simulate elements of PAD to address this. The second aim will investigate: 'Are there any micro-RNAs that are differentially expressed in the blood of patients with PAD versus controls, or in patients with varying severity of PAD?' This will enable us to identify bio-markers(s) for early diagnosis of, and/or risk stratification in PAD. In addition, this may give us new targets/tools to modulate outcomes in PAD. The final aim will investigate the therapeutic potential of a pair of micro-RNAs that has shown to regulate blood vessel formation in preliminary studies in our lab.","10930415; ","HAZARIKA, SUROVI ;","CARLSON, DREW E","09/01/2016","07/30/2017","Address; Adult; Affect; American; Amputation; angiogenesis; Angiogenesis Inhibitors; Apoptosis; Apoptotic; artery occlusion; Binding Proteins; biobank; Biological Markers; Blood; Blood flow; blood vessel development; cardiovascular risk factor; career; Cell Count; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell Cycle; cell motility; Cell physiology; Cell Survival; Cells; Clinic; Clinical; clinically relevant; Collaborations; Coronary Arteriosclerosis; Data; Databases; design; Diagnosis; Diagnostic; diagnostic biomarker; Diagnostic tests; differential expression; Disease; Distal; Down-Regulation; Early Diagnosis; Elements; Endothelial Cells; extracellular; functional outcomes; gain of function; Gene Expression; Genes; Genetic; Goals; Homing; Hyperglycemia; Hypoxia; Impairment; improved; In Vitro; Injury; injury and repair; Intermittent Claudication; Ischemia; Isolated limb perfusion; Leg; Letters; Limb structure; Literature; loss of function; Lower Extremity; Measures; Medical; Methods; MicroRNAs; Modeling; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; mouse model; Muscle; Muscle Cells; Muscle Fibers; novel marker; Outcome; Outcome Measure; overexpression; Pain in lower limb; paracrine; Pathway interactions; patient stratification; Patients; Perfusion; Peripheral arterial disease; Peripheral Vascular Diseases; Physicians; Plasma; Prevalence; Process; prognostic; Prognostic Marker; public health relevance; Recovery; Regulation; Regulator Genes; Research; Research Personnel; response; response to injury; Rest; Ribonucleases; Risk; Risk stratification; Role; Sampling; Scientist; Serum; Severities; specific biomarkers; Starvation; Stem cells; Systems Biology; targeted treatment; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Agents; Time; Tissues; tool; Transcript; Ulcer; Up-Regulation; Vascular blood supply; Walking; Work; ","Role of micro-RNA's in PAD","130573","MCBS","NHLBI Mentored Clinical and Basic Science Review Committee ","","","02","25467","2037","27504",""
