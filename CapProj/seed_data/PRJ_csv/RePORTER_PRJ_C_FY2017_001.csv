This creative and innovative study will provide brain neural feedback to stroke survivors so that they can actually see with their own  eyes how their brain is functioning and, importantly, how to modulate their brain signals so as to recover more normal brain control of upper limb movements. The treatment protocol also includes the use of a practice-assist device, comfortable functional electrical stimulation (FES), which is triggered during practice, by the stroke survivor's own intentional brain signal.

The precursor to this disease (beryllium sensitization; BeS) progresses to CBD at a rate of approximately 6-8% per year. The molecular mechanisms involved in the progression of BeS to CBD, including the role of lung alveolar macrophages (AMs), still remain poorly understood. In this study we plan to explore the novel hypothesis that CBD AMs downregulate the negative immunoregulatory gene CD55 and its pathway and overexpress the positive regulatory activating JAK/STAT pathway, which augments the immune response to Be and progression from BeS to CBD. These studies will shed light on exposure-mediated immune dysregulation in AMs that lead to disease progression and reveal potential biomarkers for clinical prognosis and diagnosis.","8824792; ","LI, LI ;","HUMBLE, MICHAEL  C","09/30/2016","08/31/2021","abstracting; Adenoviruses; Alveolar Macrophages; Antibodies; base; Berylliosis; Beryllium; Binding; Biological Markers; Breathing; Bronchoalveolar Lavage; CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes; CD55 Antigens; CD80 gene; Cell surface; Cells; Cessation of life; Chronic berylliosis; Chronic Disease; Clinical; Complement; crosslink; Data; Development; Diagnosis; Disease; Disease Progression; Down-Regulation; Family; FCGR3B gene; Fibrosis; Figs - dietary; follow-up; Gene Expression; Genes; genetic linkage; Goals; Granulomatous; HLA-DP Antigens; HLA-DPB1 gene; HLA-DR Antigens; Immune; Immune response; Immune Response Genes; improved; In Vitro; Individual; inhibitor/antagonist; innovation; JAK1 gene; JAK2 gene; knock-down; Knowledge; Lead; Light; Longitudinal Studies; Lung; Lung diseases; Lung Inflammation; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; member; Modeling; Molecular; neutralizing antibody; novel; novel marker; Organ; outcome forecast; overexpression; Pathway interactions; Patients; Phenotype; Phosphorylation; Population; potential biomarker; prevent; Production; Proteins; Public Health; Regulator Genes; Regulatory Pathway; Research; Respiratory Insufficiency; Role; Sampling; Staging; STAT1 gene; STAT3 gene; System; T cell response; targeted treatment; Testing; therapeutic target; TNF gene; TNFRSF5 gene; transcriptome sequencing; Work; Workplace; ","The immunoregulatory role of Alveolar Macrophages in Chronic Beryllium Disease","025722","SIEE","Systemic Injury by Environmental Exposure ","","A1","01","233566","129305","362871",""

Abnormal phosphorylation of the microtubule associated protein tau is a major hallmark of AD but how this contributes to synaptic dysfunction is unknown. One possibility is that tau hyperphosphorylation disrupts the normal function of tau in regulating dynamics of the microtubule and actin cytoskeleton required for morphological plasticity of presynaptic axon endings and postsynaptic dendritic spines. We will explore this possibility in neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stems cells from normal subjects and from patients with Alzheimer's.

The proposed studies will be the first to identify whether a TIA has residual functional motor control deficits.

KS is the  most common AIDS-defining cancer in HIV-positive individuals, although KS can also occur in  HIV-negative individuals. KS is a highly angiogenic tumor that is driven by KSHV-infected  endothelial-derived spindle cells, and KS lesions express high levels of cytokines and  angiogenic growth factors. We have found that KSHV infection significantly alters angiogenesis,  migration, and survival of endothelial cells. In this application, we propose to determine how  cellular and viral proteins promote endothelial cell migration, angiogenesis and survival of the  infected cell and how this shapes the tumor microenvironment. We hypothesize that the  modulation of cell migration, angiogenesis, survival and the tumor microenvironment by KSHV  promotes oncogenesis and contributes to the pathogenesis associated with KSHV infection.  Thus, the proposed studies will provide significant and biologically relevant insights into KSHV  biology, and will also identify new targets for therapies against KSHV-associated cancers.","6931559; ","DAMANIA, BLOSSOM A;","","05/01/1997","06/30/2021","abstracting; Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Affect; angiogenesis; ataxia telangiectasia mutated protein; ATM Signaling Pathway; Automobile Driving; Biology; cell motility; Cell physiology; Cell Proliferation; Cell Shape; Cell Survival; Cells; Cellular biology; chemokine; CTLA4 gene; cytokine; Data; DNA Damage; Endothelial Cells; Event; Gene Expression; Growth; HIV; HIV Seropositivity; Human Herpesvirus 8; humanized mouse; Immune; Immunobiology; immunoregulation; Immunotherapy; In Vitro; in vivo; Individual; Infection; insight; Kaposi Sarcoma; Lesion; lytic replication; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; migration; monocyte; mouse model; Multicentric Angiofollicular Lymphoid Hyperplasia; neoplastic cell; new therapeutic target; Pathogenesis; PDCD1LG1 gene; Permeability; Play; primary effusion lymphoma; Proteins; reactivation from latency; receptor; response; Role; Satellite Viruses; STAT3 gene; T-Cell Activation; T-Lymphocyte; therapeutic target; tumor; tumor microenvironment; tumorigenesis; Viral Genes; Viral Proteins; ","Project 3 - Modulation of host cell biology by KSHV","019014","ZCA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","7902","","37","204061","104907","","308968"

Study findings will enable a tangible move toward precision nursing surveillance (knowing who, when, why in advance of overt CRI), so that nurses can detect CRI better, intervene sooner, and shift CRI nursing care from reactive to preemptive. Developing a sensitive, specific and parsimonious means to nowcast and forecast CRI also has important implications for improving nursing care processes (case load mixture, workload, staff allocation) and delivery systems (patient triage to monitored or non-monitored units, higher vs. lower cost bed allocation, adverse events prevention).","7366567 (contact); 1881530; ","HRAVNAK, MARILYN  (contact); PINSKY, MICHAEL R;","DIANA, AUGUSTO ","09/27/2012","06/30/2020","Active Learning; Acute respiratory failure; Adverse event; Algorithms; base; Beds; Boxing; California; care delivery; Care given by nurses; Caring; Clinical; Clinical Decision Support Systems; Clinical Trials; Communities; Comparative Study; Complex; cost; Data; Data Collection; Data Set; Detection; Diagnostic; Diffuse; Discipline of Nursing; Discrimination; Electronic Health Record; Environment; Evaluation; Event; Failure; Fatigue; Frequencies; Future; graphical user interface; high risk; Human; Hypovolemia; improved; Intervention; Intuition; Knowledge; Laboratories; Lead; Learning; Machine Learning; Maps; Measurement; Medical center; Modality; Modeling; Monitor; Morbidity - disease rate; Morphologic artifacts; mortality; multidisciplinary; novel; Nurses; patient safety; Patient Triage; Patients; Pattern; Performance; Phenotype; Physiologic Monitoring; Physiological; prevent; Prevention; Process; prognostic; prototype; public health relevance; Qualifying; Resolution; Running; Sampling; screening; Sensitivity and Specificity; Sepsis; Series; simulation; Site; Source; Specificity; Staff Work Load; Supportive care; surveillance strategy; System; Techniques; temporal measurement; Testing; Time; treatment response; Triage; Universities; Visual; Work; ","Predicting Patient Instability Noninvasively for Nursing Care-Two (PPINNC-2)","013912","BCHI","Biomedical Computing and Health Informatics Study Section ","","","04","527650","128817","656467",""

We evaluate novel approaches to reduce cultural or educational bias in cognitive assessments. By using a tablet assessment with tasks that are visually-oriented and use simple language, we will be better able to disentangle the causal pathways from socioeconomic conditions to cognition.

We expect that changes in motor coordination in PD can be objectively quantified, even in extremities that show no clinically identifiable symptoms of the disease. We also plan to show that these changes in synergies may be reversed with drugs commonly used to treat PD. In future, we plan to follow prospectively PD patients over several years to explore how synergy indices predicts the occurrence of different clinical symptoms such as emergence of symptoms on the less-affected body side, postural instability, and freezing of gait.","1932479; 1868991 (contact); ","HUANG, XUEMEI ; LATASH, MARK L (contact);","SIEBER, BETH-ANNE ","09/30/2016","08/31/2018","Affect; American; arm; base; Biological Markers; Body part; Carbidopa; Clinical; Clinical Research; Cohort Studies; Data; design; Development; Devices; Disease; Dopamine; Drug Exposure; drug testing; Effectiveness; Ensure; Environment; Exposure to; falls; Fingers; Foundations; Freezing; Future; Gait; Goals; Gold; Hand; Hour; improved; indexing; individual patient; Intervention; Joints; Levodopa; Limb structure; Locomotion; Long-Term Effects; Measurement; Methods; Motor; motor impairment; motor symptom; Movement; Muscle; nervous system disorder; Neurons; Newly Diagnosed; novel; Parkinson Disease; Patients; Performance; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Physicians; Population; Posture; Preparation; Prevention; Prevention strategy; prognostic value; prospective; Prospective Studies; relating to nervous system; Replacement Therapy; research clinical testing; Research Personnel; Side; Staging; Substantia nigra structure; Symptoms; Testing; theories; Upper Extremity; user-friendly; Work; ","Indices of Motor Synergies as Early Biomarkers of Parkinson's Disease","095873","MRS","Musculoskeletal Rehabilitation Sciences Study Section ","","A1","01","150000","76854","226854",""

Myotonic dystrophy type-1 is caused by a CTG repeat expansion in the 3'UTR of the DMPK gene. This progressive disorder affects nearly every system in the body, causing progressive weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, intellectual impairment, and respiratory failure. Myotonic dystrophy type-1 is a classic example of genetic anticipation whereby progressively more severe symptoms are seen in successive generations due to increasingly large CTG repeat expansions during germline transmission. In the most striking example of this, mothers with adult onset myotonic dystrophy may have a child with congenital onset myotonic dystrophy (CDM). The exact mechanism of repeat expansion in myotonic dystrophy is complex, with DNA repair, replication, recombination and even transcription implicated in the unstable nature of triplet repeats. This proposal aims to better understand the mechanism of anticipation through: 1) Identification of variants in DNA repair and replication genes in mothers who have a child with the most severe form of myotonic dystrophy, CDM, 2) Assessing the pathogenicity of these variants in a cell model system for precise measurement of difference in repeat expansion rates. Firstly, this proposal will perform whole exome sequencing using a cohort highly enriched for anticipation, those mothers who have had a child with congenital myotonic dystrophy. Currently, 45 families within this cohort have provided DNA. Whole exome sequencing will be performed to identify variants in DNA damage response genes. Secondly, variants will be assessed for pathogenicity in a cell model system. In this system, the CTG repeat length is correlated with the expression of a fluorescent reporter gene. The longer the CTG repeat, the lower the fluorescence. Variants identified in Aim 1 will be introduced into this system to assess for their effect on the CTG repeat length. Two variants in the DNA damage response pathway, CHEK1 and FANCM, which are suspected to have altered the mutation rate in a family with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy will also be assessed. At the completion of this proposal, we would hope to better understand the mechanism of anticipation, and repeat expansion in general. Such knowledge may provide therapeutic targets to modulate repeat expansion.  ","1887590; ","WEISS, ROBERT B;","NUCKOLLS, GLEN H.","09/30/2016","08/31/2018","3' Untranslated Regions; abstracting; Address; Adult; Affect; Arrhythmia; Biological Models; Birth; Cataract; Cell Line; Cell model; Cells; CHEK1 gene; Child; cohort; Complex; Congenital Myotonic Dystrophy; design; Disease; Disease Progression; Distal; DNA; DNA biosynthesis; DNA Damage; DNA Repair; DNA Repair Gene; Duchenne muscular dystrophy; early onset; Employee Strikes; exome; exome sequencing; expectation; Family; Fathers; feeding; Flow Cytometry; Fluorescence; Fluorescence Microscopy; gene discovery; Gene-Modified; Generations; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Anticipation; genetic pedigree; Genetic Recombination; Genetic screening method; Genetic Transcription; Goals; Huntington Disease; Impairment; In Vitro; in vitro Assay; Individual; Inherited; Knowledge; Lead; Length; lymphoblastoid cell line; Measurement; Measures; Mothers; Muscle hypotonia; Mutation; Myotonia; Myotonic Dystrophy; Nature; Nerve Degeneration; new therapeutic target; novel; novel therapeutics; Outcome; Parents; Pathogenicity; Pathway interactions; Patients; Phenotype; Probability; proband; Reporter; Reporter Genes; Research; Respiratory Failure; response; Risk; Role; Sampling; Siblings; Symptoms; System; Testing; therapeutic target; transmission process; Trinucleotide Repeat Expansion; Trinucleotide Repeats; Triplet Multiple Birth; Variant; Work; ","Identifying Modifiers of Anticipation in Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1","100040","MNG","Molecular Neurogenetics Study Section ","","","01","150000","76625","226625",""

INFRASTRUCTURE AND ADMINISTRATION (Index of acronyms in Appendices Table of Contents)  A. Mission, Goals and Priorities. Minnesota is a prime arena for addressing social inequities in health.  Rapidly changing demographic composition has contributed new strengths as well as challenges to our health,  education, and social service systems. MN leads in East African, Latino and SE Asian immigration;  Minneapolis has the second largest urban American Indian population in the US. Our communities of color are  relatively young in terms of percentage of families with children, and particularly in Minneapolis and St. Paul,  health disparities are intermingled with economic distress and social segregation. The stark reality confronting  our communities and our systems of care is the deepening need for partnerships that meld community  experience with scholarship and public health (PH) practice-based knowledge. We believe, in the words of the  Lancet International Advisory Group on Adolescent Health, that '...failure to invest in the second decade of  life, despite the availability of proven and promising prevention and health promotion strategies, will  jeopardize earlier investments in health, substantially erode the quality and length of human life, and escalate  human suffering, inequity, and social instability.'1   The University of Minnesota Healthy Youth Development Prevention Research Center (UMN PRC) is  dedicated to nurturing partnerships that will co-create the fusion of knowing and doing through its core  mission: through collaboration with health departments, related agencies & community partnerships, develop  and disseminate actionable knowledge and practices that promote healthy development & health equity  among all young people, and, in so doing, advance adolescent-focused Healthy People 2020 (HP 2020) goals,  elements of the National Prevention Strategy, and CDC Winnable Battles, particularly reproductive health.   B. Organizational Structure and Linkages. Initially funded by the CDC in 1996 as the National Teen  Pregnancy Prevention Research Center, UMN PRC is embedded in an institutional context highly conducive to  achieving its core mission, goals and objectives, and leveraging complementary resources that expands its  reach and impact. As in Org Charts (App D), UMN PRC is part of an Academic Health Center (AHC) that  includes the Schools of Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, and the UMN's CTSA. UMN PRC faculty/staff are  appointed in these AHC schools along with the College of Education & Human Development. The AHC is  under the direct authority of the UMN President, whose community engagement activities are conducted  under the auspices of the Office of Public Engagement to which UMN PRC members play an ongoing advisory  role. Likewise, the UMN CTSA partners with the PRC to strengthen its own inter-collegiate community  engagement portfolio of applied public health research, training, outreach and advocacy.   UMN PRC is located within the Division of General Pediatrics & Adolescent Health (DOGPAH), with its 35- year history and expertise in adolescent health research and translation, training, TA, community partnerships,  strategic communications, and dissemination of evidence to promote effective programs, policy and public  health practice. At its inception, UMN PRC capitalized on this experience through immediate formation of a  Community Advisory Network, and involvement of community partners, health departments and related  agencies in the crafting of our earliest core research focused on preventing teen pregnancy and sexual risk  behaviors (Prime Time). This early research evolved into school and clinic-based interventions that engaged  community members, educators and PH professionals in youth-development strategies to prevent teen  pregnancy, violence involvement, and school dropout. Our earliest intra- and inter-collegiate linkages with the  Konopka Institute for Best Practices in Adolescent Health (and its State Adolescent Health Resource Center  that provides TA and consultation to the nation's network of State Adolescent Health Coordinators), the  Center for Adolescent Nursing (with its extensive history of adolescent health research and preparation of the  scholarly and practice workforce), and the School of Public Health, nurtured the early development of an  interdisciplinary faculty and staff, linked across academic units, with a shared commitment to prevention  science, community engagement, applied research and its translation into action.   C. Staffing Plan. UMN PRC 2014-2019 will be guided by a Leadership Team comprised of Director Resnick,  Deputy Director Sieving, and Team Leaders: Oliphant (Community), Shea (Communications), Jordan  (Training), Shlafer (Evaluation) and McMorris (Research). The UMN PRC Org Chart (App D) depicts the  Leadership Team that will provide overall direction to the PRC, the interdisciplinary teams for each unit, their  key activities, and reporting lines within the broader context of the Division. We developed this organizational  structure in our initial funding cycle, honed and refined over time, recognizing that a Leadership Team that  includes CAN co-chairs (nominated & elected as per CAN by-laws) is essential to a PRC that is nimble and  responsive to priorities and concerns from health departments and other community partners. The UMN PRC  led the March 2008 PRC national network pre-conference ?Structured for Success? that explicated the PRC  network?s experiences with varying infrastructure arrangements. With the goal of enhancing each PRC's  capacity to increase its own effectiveness through infrastructure modification and improvements, this marked  the 1st time in the history of the network that PRC directors/representatives shared with each other the various  infrastructure arrangements crosscutting the national network.  D. Leveraged Resources and Institutional Commitments. Since its inception, UMN PRC has garnered  approximately $21,000,000 in research and training grants, PRC Special Interest Projects, foundation grants,    contracts and external sales. Documented in Letters of Support and shown in the UMN Org Relationships  Chart, the UMN institutional commitment in this competitive renewal application equals approximately  $365,000, i.e., annual match dollars for each of 5 years of the project period from the Office of the Vice President  for Research ($10,000), the AHC ($20,000), Department of Pediatrics ($20,000), CTSA (15% Training Team  Leader Jordan salary and fringe support, ~$23,000), and the Division of General Pediatrics & Adolescent  Health (office space, administrative, financial and technological support).   E. Qualifications and History of PRC Director. On faculty since 1981, Michael Resnick, PhD, Professor of  Pediatrics, Nursing, and Public Health, holds the Konopka Chair in Adolescent Health & Development. He is  the founding PD/PI (1996) of the UMN PRC. With colleagues, his work has had a transformative impact on  shaping the field of adolescent health in the US and globally. Beginning in the 1980s, under his leadership of  the National Adolescent Health Resource Center (funded by MCHB/HRSA/DHHS), the MN Adolescent  Health Survey and the subsequent American Indian Adolescent Health Survey (the largest survey of American  Indian and Alaskan Native youth ever undertaken at the time) formed the basis for the CDC in creating the  National Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS). Resnick served as a consultant to the CDC as the YRBS was  being developed, which today, is implemented in nearly every state across the country. His federal  congressional testimony on the findings of the Indian Adolescent Health Survey helped propel Congress to  authorize more than $30 million for adolescent mental health for young people on reservations, a 1st in the  history of the Indian Health Service. Resnick was also invited under two presidential administrations to be a  keynote speaker at White House conferences on youth. It is this interweaving of research and the translation of  research to improve the health and well-being of young people that has characterized his career. It is also  because of his growing reputation that in the mid 1990s he was invited to be a Co-PI on the National  Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) where, leading the MN team he had lead responsibility  for crafting the initial adolescent health survey component of that study. That landmark research was released  in 1997 with Resnick as lead author in JAMA. 2 This seminal article has been cited more than nearly any other  publication in the field of adolescent health and led to widespread prominence of the theme that has  epitomized his research: the influence of connectedness on adolescent health and well-being.   Resnick's work has had a profound impact on the field of adolescent health, ranging from our own federal  Office of Adolescent Health to the work of transnational institutions such as the World Health Organization,  the Pan American Health Organization, UNICEF, and more recently, the Lancet International Advisory Group  on Adolescent Health, where we see adoption of the healthy youth development paradigm that flows directly  from Resnick's work. In this area of research and research translation, no measures are more frequently used,  than those developed by Resnick with his interdisciplinary team at UMN. The use of this research on how to  best advance health equity in young people, assuring their ability to enter into rapidly changing social contexts  and a very complex global economy, embodies what Resnick has long defined as a goal of his career: to use  science, translation, dissemination and evidence-based advocacy to assure that we regard adolescents as whole human  beings in the context of family, peers, school and community, not as a simple set of risk indicators. It is his ability to  translate that research that has resulted in global impact. He has been invited to speak at policy and research  forums in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Portugal, Britain, Malaysia, Iceland, Germany, Switzerland, and  Turkey. And because of his international reputation he has attracted fellows and trainees from not only across  the United States but from Spain, Australia, New Zealand, Ghana, China, Barbados, Argentina, Uruguay,  Israel, and Canada, seeking to learn how to conduct research into healthy youth development and to translate  that work to set public health priorities and policies that benefit youth.   Resnick has been PI or Co-I on numerous federal and foundation research grants focusing on health and  risk behaviors, resiliency and protective factors in the lives of young people, with emphasis on issues related to  adolescent sexual behaviors, teen pregnancy, violence and school drop-out. He has been PI on $17.7 million in  external grants (NIH, CDC, MCHB, foundations) and co- PI/co-author on an additional $8.7 million in external  grants (counting awards of >$100,000). He has 177 peer reviewed journal articles, book chapters, reviews, and  monographs, many reflecting his active mentoring of newer faculty, fellows, and staff. He has served as a  consultant/reviewer for WHO, NSF, CDC, NIH, the Society for Adolescent Health & Medicine, the Guttmacher  Institute, the Natl Campaign to Prevent Teen & Unplanned Pregnancy, and several international research  councils. He has received 4 outstanding teaching and research awards. His PRC commitment will be 25%,  supported by a combination of PRC funds and resources from his Endowed Chair and match dollars.   F. Multidisciplinary Faculty and Staff with Demonstrated Experience. The UMN Org Chart shows the  academic appointments and inter-linkages of faculty and staff across the Schools of Medicine, Nursing, and  Public Health, and within our Division (DOGPAH) that create the group comprising UMN PRC. A particular  strength of this team is its intercollegiate, interdisciplinary composition, years of continuity in terms of  working relationships, and extensive experience in partnering with state, county and local health departments,  related agencies, and an array of community partners that share a commitment to nurturing healthy  adolescent development and the promotion of health equity among all young people. A table in Facilities &    Resources lists the PRC members, their areas of expertise and those who hold 1o and 2o appointments in AHC  schools and elsewhere at UMN. Our embeddedness in collaborative networks further flows from a long series  of core, community-partnered PRC projects that link scholarship, practice and dissemination of evidence with  our broader constituents and partners, foremost among them - state and local health departments, schools and  youth-serving agencies. As noted in a table in Facilities & Resources, PRC members are partnered with  national, regional, state and local collaborating organizations in a variety of capacities: research, TA, training,  evaluation, program and policy development, enactment, and diffusion. These relationships provide the basis  for our proposed scope of work, designed to address adolescent-focused national health goals, elements of the  National Prevention Strategy, and the CDC's Winnable Battles.  G. Ongoing-prevention Projects & Activities. UMN PRC members are engaged in a wide array of  prevention/health promotion activities supported by a diverse portfolio of funding that reflects our  interdisciplinary composition and well-established partnerships. These research, training and dissemination  activities will underpin much of UMN PRC's plan for activities over the next 5 years, involving state, county  and local departments of health, related agencies, community organizations and scholarly partners that share a  commitment to healthy youth development, the dual strategy of reducing risk while enhancing protective  factors and capacity in the lives of young people, and enhancing health equity that promotes positive life  trajectories for youth, particular those living in challenging social environments.

COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, PARTNERSHIPS, AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  A. Collaboration with Community Health Departments and Other Stakeholders. UMN PRC has an  extensive history of collaborating with and providing technical assistance (TA) to local, county and state  departments of health. As shown in the Work Plan, these ties will continue as we engage in work that connects  with community and increases the capacity of the PH workforce, i.e., we will capitalize on these relationships  as evidenced through Letters of Support.   Community Advisory Network: Headed by Team Leader Oliphant, UMN PRC will utilize the expertise of  our Community Advisory Network (CAN). Members of CAN are professionals who have broad expertise in  community-based health issues with young people and are employed by PH departments, departments of  education, and community-based non-profits. Half of the current members work in city, county and state  public health departments thereby strengthening the CAN-UMN PRC connection to public health. CAN  advises on various aspects of UMN PRC, including the core research project, community engagement efforts,  PH policies, training priorities, and dissemination strategies. Also, CAN provides invaluable guidance on  accessing youth-serving professionals, such as nurse practitioners and physicians, teachers, and other public  health professionals and will continue to advise on best means for reaching target populations and ensuring  greater reach and impact of Center activities. Past examples of CAN involvement include advising on  dissemination of the state's policy plan for teen pregnancy prevention, development of topics for training in  the Summer Institute, and advising on the core research projects such as assessing the need of out-of-school  youth. Letters of Support detail activities, roles and responsibilities, and partnerships goals for 2014-19.     Led by 2 co-chairs (elected by the whole body of the CAN to serve 2-year terms), the entire CAN meets  quarterly with additional ad hoc meetings as needed; co-chairs also participate in monthly Leadership Team  meetings. Co-chairs and all CAN members fulfill duties as outlined by the UMN PRC's CAN job descriptions,  rules/policies, and community engagement agreement, all created and approved by CAN (App D). A bi- monthly electronic newsletter assures communication with CAN, the Youth Advisory Board (described  below), and local, state and national partners. UMN PRC co-chairs have always actively engaged in the  National Community Committee (NCC), serving as chairs or members of the Oral Health Special Interest  Group, Policies & Procedures, and Fund Development. Oliphant and at least one co-chair have regularly  attended all NCC activities and participate in NCC monthly telephone calls. Oliphant has the trust of CAN  and extensive connections to community members, including UMN PRC's target populations. A founding  member of the now highly organized NCC, Oliphant has led UMN PRC's CAN since its inception.   Youth Advisory Board. UMN PRC will build on its existing Division's Youth Advisory Board (YAB). YAB  currently consists of 8 adolescents and young adults (ages 14-21 yrs) who have been trained on adolescent  health issues, including teaching interviewing skills to health providers. YAB will be expanded to include 3  youth who have been participating as peer educators in our current PRC core Latino teen pregnancy  prevention research project. YAB members are paid on an hourly basis with PRC match funding. Guided by  Oliphant, YAB will follow a Youth-on-Boards training model for its monthly meetings designed to advise on  various UMN PRC activities.  One YAB member elected by YAB will participate in CAN and PRC Leadership  Team meetings. In addition, YAB members will be engaged in community activities, providing TA to health  departments for the development of programming as well as providing training and feedback around  interviewing skills to medical and oral health professionals. Thus, YAB members will serve as technical  experts and teachers to practitioners who need training in best practices for interviewing adolescents on  specific topics related to the HP 2020 goals identified in the Community Engagement Work Plan.   B. Community Support and Engagement. UMN PRC will collaborate and provide TA to several departments  of health and education in its proposed scope of work, to commence in Fall 2014, including:   1. Oral Health and HPV-An Adolescent Health Initiative: The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH)  and UMN PRC will collaborate to develop a best-practice approach for MN dentists and oral health providers  to increase the awareness of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and the link to oropharyngeal cancer (OPC).   MDH's Oral Health Program and UMN PRC will develop a module for interviewing skills for dental health  providers that focuses on HPV, HPV vaccine and adolescent-friendly services, especially in school settings.  This work is an extension of the MDH Oral Health State Plan and the PRC's NCC Oral Health Work Group  with approaches based on CDC's recommendations for approaching high-risk groups for HPV-associated  OPCs and current trends in the incidence of HPV-positive OPCs. YAB members will provide direction on  module development and teach the module to oral healthcare providers. Sparked by conversations with the  Natl Oral Health Alliance, NCC, and MDH, this novel approach of using adolescents to teach oral health  providers is the 1st of its kind. Key stakeholders include the MN Oral Health Program and MDH Center for  Health Promotion. Under the director's leadership, we will have access to the statewide network of dental  providers and entry into annual conferences of oral health providers to teach the new module.   2. Adolescent Health Clinics Standards of Care and MN's DASH HIV Grant: Hennepin County (which  includes Minneapolis) Human Services and Public Health Department efforts to standardize clinical care for  adolescents are a systems-level innovation critical for improved adolescent sexual health outcomes. The  standards align with federal-level initiatives in the Office of Adolescent Health, CDC's Divs. of Reproductive  Health and Adolescent & School Health (DASH) that emphasize the use of standards-based approaches. We  will partner with Hennepin County, MDH and MDE staff funded by CDC DASH and the Natl Network of  State Adolescent Health Coordinators with the State Adolescent Health Resource Center (SAHRC) to  expanded adoption of clinical standards. This partnership will target new Hennepin County clinics, statewide  clinics in school districts targeted through the DASH grant, and nationally, clinics in other states, via the  training of State Adolescent Health Coordinators involved in sexual health programs. The partnership will  leverage diffusion of innovation strategies to accomplish this goal: segmenting audiences based on adoption  and thought-leader status, identifying and promoting the relative advantages of adoption, and addressing  compatibility, complexity and trial-ability. These will be promoted via 1) applied communications strategies  and products (UMN PRC and Hennepin County will co-create a tool kit); 2) experiential training facilitated by  the YAB that will offer clinics real-world experience effectively engaging adolescents; and 3) through inter- personal interactions and relationships, likely accomplished through the formation of a national Collaborative  Innovation Network that will allow partners to directly support one another. We regularly partner with  SAHRC to support state PH department collaborations to improve systems approaches to adolescent health.   3. MN Chlamydia Partnership (MCP): MDH identified chlamydia as a leading cause of morbidity in MN.  Seeking an innovative strategy for its prevention and control, the STD Clinical Specialist Infertility Prevention  Project Coordinator (MDH STD and HIV Section) and key stakeholder has requested the UMN PRC to provide  TA on future MCP activities. Specifically, through monthly planning meetings and in-the-field TA, we will     collaborate on models of care and dissemination of best practices for chlamydia control.  These approaches are  grounded in the MN State Plan for Chlamydia Prevention developed in a current partnership between MDH and  UMN PRC. We will work collaboratively both locally and in greater Minnesota to provide county and local  public health as well as community-based health non-profits on non-traditional approaches to the prevention  and control of this sexually transmitted disease as outlined in the MN State Plan.  4. Minneapolis Urban Initiative for Reproductive Health: UMN PRC and the Minneapolis Urban Initiative  for Reproductive Health under the guidance of key stakeholder, Minneapolis Health Department, will  collaborate on development of an innovative model to provide sexual health education to students along with  their teachers and coaches in this large urban school district. We will provide TA on implementation of  evidence-based sexual health curricula in all 6-8th grade classrooms in the district, as well as in the district's  charter and alternative schools. UMN PRC will also provide leadership in development of a program designed  to assist coaches in preventing sexual bullying within school sports teams and among team members.   5. Minneapolis Blueprint for Youth Violence Prevention: Minneapolis and its health department are  widely-recognized for ground-breaking work in implementing a comprehensive, multi-sectorial plan to  prevent youth violence: Blueprint for Action: Preventing Youth Violence. As one of a select group of cities invited  to join the Urban Networks to Increase Thriving Youth (UNITY) through a CDC-funded cooperative  agreement, Minneapolis promotes collaboration across public and private sectors and adoption of a  comprehensive approaches to violence prevention. True to a PH model, the Blueprint lays out 1o, 2o, and 3o  prevention goals along with 34 action steps to reduce and prevent youth violence. An executive committee  including PRC, government, nonprofit, business and youth representation provides oversight.  6. It's That Easy: It's That Easy (ITE) offers parent educators with the training and tools needed to empower  parents to connect with their children, share family values, and engage in conversations about sexuality and  relationships. ITE is a train-the-trainer model for youth-serving organizations and health/education  departments in urban and rural areas as well as culturally-specific groups, e.g., tribal nations. Co-sponsors are  MDH, MDE, and TeenWise MN, a statewide non-profit for teen pregnancy prevention. We will assist in  expanding an ITE dissemination plan and serve as content experts to curriculum and website development.  7. Diffusion of Innovation with State Adolescent Health Resource Center (SAHRC): Given our co- location with SAHRC, we are uniquely poised to promote innovative models of partnership with local and  state health departments reaching national audiences. SAHRC (described in Letter of Support) provides TA to  the nation?s adolescent health staff in state health departments and serves as facilitator for the National  Network of State Adolescent Health Coordinators - the membership organization for all state adolescent  health coordinators. Recognizing that many UMN PRC community-based projects align well with work  underway in other states, UMN PRC will partner with SAHRC to 1) disseminate relevant, highly applied  evidence; 2) frame information for adoption of innovation by highlighting advantages and compatibility with  existing values and practices; 3) facilitate adoption by engaging adolescent health coordinator networks,  identifying an avant-garde of early adopters, and providing them with strategic TA for piloting of innovations.  III. COMMUNICATION AND DISSEMINATION  A. Infrastructure for Communication and Dissemination. UMN PRC offers an infrastructure of resources and  personnel to support communication and dissemination activities with the expertise and capacity to translate  research findings and evidence-based practices to various audiences while aligning with diffusion of  innovation practices. Since its inception in 1996, UMN PRC has prioritized communications/dissemination -  most notably by Resnick, UMN PRC Director (in conjunction with former Division Director, R. Blum), whose  dissemination vision included landmark analyses of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health  and translation of these research findings into a monograph series (supported by the Robert Wood Johnson  Foundation) for specific audience segments (education, health care, parent/family support professionals) as  well as for general public audiences. Dissemination strategies also included partnership with a recognized PR  firm (Burness Communications) that resulted in legislative and national press briefings. Resnick has elevated  this priority by hiring Shea, Communications Team Leader, a marketing and communications professional  with >20 years of communications experience in both hi-tech advertising executive and community/academic  settings. Shea directs all PRC communications activities, sets strategy, framing and messaging direction, writes  copy and handles graphic design assignments. Shea's expertise is sought by local, state, and national partners  and she is frequently asked to consult with adolescent health professionals and organizations. Shea also is  recognized locally for her work on state sexual health plans targeting policy and systems changes including A  Work in Progress: Building a Minnesota State Plan for Teen Pregnancy Prevention and Parenting (2003) and  Recommendations for Action from the UMN Chlamydia Partnership - A Special Report (2012).   Shea and Resnick's work is conducted in collaboration with and informed by UMN PRC members and  community partners (examples below). External vendors with expertise in graphic design, PR/media relations,  video production and social media strategy/production enhance UMN PRC's communications capacity. Given  the scope of proposed communications objectives, a .6 FTE will be added to current staff FTE.    Communications capacity is also supported by the UMN which offers a wealth of communications related  resources including the AHC and University Relations PR and communications staff, AHC computer technical  support, printing and video production capabilities, website design and content management as well as a host  of collaboration (e.g. the Communicators Forum) and training (social media; web technologies) opportunities.   B. Website. UMN PRC has the capacity, expertise and technical support to further develop and maintain a  UMN PRC website. The web infrastructure is supported through the AHC which provides consultants and an  easy-to-use content management system, enabling the PRC to maintain the site locally. UMN has recently  migrated to a suite of Google-powered communication and collaboration tools and, through search engine  optimization, delivers highly ranked Google search results.   C. Communications Plan.

Word retrieval interventions to maintain or restore communicative function are needed. Studies have shown that physical exercise can improve word learning in young adults.

The proposed study aims to explore a previously-unrecognized role and the underlying molecular mechanisms of lysine methylation of the chemokine receptor CXCR2 by a histone methyltransferase SMYD1 in modulating EPC migration and angiogenesis. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the mechanistic studies of CXCR2 methylation are likely to provide valuable information and potential therapeutic targets for enhancing EPC-based cell therapy for certain vascular diseases, as well as to fundamentally advance the field of chemokine receptor biology. Therefore, the work detailed in this proposal is relevant to NIH's mission as it pertains to the pursuit of fundamental knowledge regarding the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to extend healthy life and reduce the burdens of illness.","8800936; ","LI, CHUNYING ;","GAO, YUNLING ","07/01/2015","04/30/2020","Adhesions; Affect; angiogenesis; Animal Model; Area; Attenuated; base; Behavior; Biochemical; Biological; Biological Assay; Biology; Blood Circulation; Blood Vessels; Bone Marrow; burden of illness; Cardiac; cardiogenesis; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cardiovascular Physiology; cell motility; Cell physiology; Cell Therapy; Cellular biology; chemokine; chemokine receptor; Chronic; Complex; Cytoplasm; Development; Embryo; Endothelial Cells; Endothelium; Epigenetic Process; Event; glycosylation; Goals; Health; histone methyltransferase; Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase; Histones; Home environment; Homeostasis; Homing; IL8RB gene; In Vitro; in vivo; injured; Injury; innovation; Ischemia; Knock-out; Knowledge; Life; Ligands; Link; Lysine; Mediating; member; Methylation; Methyltransferase; Mission; Modification; Molecular; Morphogenesis; Mus; Muscle Development; Myocardial Ischemia; Myocardium; Nature; neovascular; neovascularization; neovasculature; new therapeutic target; non-histone protein; novel; novel therapeutics; Organism; Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases; Phosphorylation; Play; Post-Translational Protein Processing; Protein Family; Protein Phosphatase 2A Regulatory Subunit PR53; Public Health; Receptor Activation; Regenerative Medicine; repaired; Reporting; Research; Risk Factors; Role; Signal Transduction; Site; Skeletal Muscle; Stem cells; Techniques; Testing; Therapeutic; therapeutic target; Tissues; Ubiquitination; Vascular Diseases; vasculogenesis; Work; ","Chemokine Signaling in EPC Angiogenesis:  A Role of Lysine Methylation","128647","VCMB","Vascular Cell and Molecular Biology Study Section ","","","03","216130","114318","330448",""

Many processes have been found to be altered in aged organisms, but how these processes are connected remains incompletely understood. We have established a new genetic and biochemical connection between two of these critical aging associated processes - telomere maintenance and proteostasis. TCAB1 represents a node controlling both telomerase and function of scaRNAs involved in modification of splicing RNAs. TCAB1 is highly sensitive to the TRiC proteostasis pathway, suggesting that changes in aging that affect TRiC function may alter several RNA-dependent pathways, thereby connecting proteostasis to RNA metabolism.","7810696; ","ARTANDI, STEVEN E;","GUO, MAX ","02/01/2010","08/31/2017","Affect; aged; Aging; Biochemical; Bioinformatics; Cell Nucleus; Cells; chaperonin; Chemicals; Defect; Development; Disease; DNA Repair; Dyskeratosis Congenita; Elderly; Embryo; Enabling Factors; Enzymes; Eukaryota; Evolution; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Screening; genome-wide; Germ-Line Mutation; germline stem cells; Goals; Health; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Holoenzymes; Homeostasis; Human; human tissue; in vivo; insulin signaling; interest; Investigation; Knockout Mice; Lead; Length; Maintenance; Measures; Mediating; Messenger RNA; Metabolism; Mitochondria; Modification; Mouse Strains; mRNA Precursor; Mus; Natural regeneration; Normal Cell; Normal tissue morphology; novel; Organelles; Organism; Pathway interactions; Pattern; Premature aging syndrome; Process; Proteins; Reading; recombinase; Reverse Transcription; RNA; RNA Splicing; Role; Small Nuclear RNA; Stem cells; Telomerase; telomere; Telomere Maintenance; Telomere Shortening; Tissues; trafficking; transcriptome sequencing; ","Defining the telomerase holoenzyme in progenitor cells with aging","033747","CMAD","Cellular Mechanisms in Aging and Development Study Section ","","A1","06","367894","228859","596753",""

Paradoxically, while many people have recurrent eye infections only some go on to develop HSK, which is an inflammatory disease. We speculate that this disparity might arise from differences in the gut bacteria of people with and without HSK, because recent research has revealed that a balanced gut bacterial community (microbiota) is essential for optimal immune system function and health. Studies in this proposal utilize germfree (GF) mice and transfers of gut bacteria from mouse strains either resistant or susceptible to HSK into GF mice to determine involvement of the microbiota in HSK development after HSV infection. The long-term goal is to identify bacterial strains that when introduced into susceptible (GF) mice prevent HSK, HSE and other viral induced inflammatory diseases, which will provide a framework for future efforts to develop probiotic bacterial strains or prebiotics that can be used prophylatically to treat recurrent HSK.","1892557; ","CANTIN, EDOUARD M;","MCKIE, GEORGE ANN","09/30/2016","07/31/2018","129 Mouse; Accounting; Address; Affect; Afferent Neurons; angiogenesis; Antibiotics; Archaea; Bacteria; Bacterial Genes; Bacterial Proteins; base; Bioinformatics; Blindness; Blood Vessels; Cicatrix; Collection; Communities; conjunctiva; Cornea; corneal epithelium; Corneal Opacity; corneal scar; Data; Developed Countries; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; Disease; Disease Outbreaks; Edema; Encephalitis; Endocrine system; Energy Metabolism; Enteral; Epithelial; Equilibrium; evidence base; experience; Eye; Eye diseases; Eye Infections; Eyelid structure; Functional disorder; fungus; Future; gene product; Genital system; Goals; gut microbiota; Health; Herpes encephalitis; Herpes Labialis; Herpesvirus 1; Herpetic Keratitis; Immune; Immune system; Immunity; Individual; Infection; Infectious Agent; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Inflammatory Response; Investigation; Keratitis; latent infection; Lesion; Life; Malignant Neoplasms; Measures; Mediating; microbial community; microbiota; Mouse Strains; Mucous Membrane; Mus; neovascularization; Nervous system structure; Neurons; neuropsychiatric disorder; next generation sequencing; novel; Obesity; Oral; orofacial; Pathway interactions; Patients; Physiological; Population; prebiotics; Predisposition; prevent; Primary Infection; Probiotics; Process; prophylactic; Prunella vulgaris; Recurrence; Recurrent disease; Regulation; Research; research study; Resistance; Retina; Role; rRNA Genes; Safety; Sensory Ganglia; Severities; Simplexvirus; Site; Skin; stressor; Structure of trigeminal ganglion; Symptoms; targeted treatment; Testing; Therapeutic Agents; Tissues; translational study; Trigeminal System; Validation; Viral; Virus; Virus Replication; Virus Shedding; Visual impairment; ","Role for the Microbiota in Development of Herpes Stromal Keratitis","027068","VIRB","Virology - B Study Section ","","","01","139583","86440","226023",""

In persons with SCI, the relationship between lower vitamin D levels with pulmonary function decline and chest illness rates will be assessed.

Patient survey studies have shown that prostate cancer surgery results in long-term incontinence, sufficient to require pads, in up to 1of 3 of men undergoing surgery. Incontinence can be a physical, emotional, psychosocial and economic burden for the men affected. An intervention to improve urine control after prostate cancer surgery will have a particularly significant impact on the quality of life of the veteran populatio. Therapies that can reduce persistent incontinence, such as the evidence-based pelvic floor muscle training program proposed, are likely to result in cost-savings to the VA by reducing use of absorptive pads (provided to veterans by the VA) and by avoiding nursing home placement as these veterans age.

One of the most common complications of diabetes, diabetic retinopathy, is the leading cause of blindness in working age adults. In addition, changes in the neurons of the diabetic retina occur prior to other retinal damage and are likely intimately related to other diabetic complications, for example, cognitive decline and structural changes in the brain. The continued rise in the number of diabetic patients and the complexity of their care underscores the urgent need to identify an earlier window for treatment. We seek to identify this window and develop clinically translatable treatments to target complications prior to obvious signs and symptoms.

Normally, STAT3 is an important  mediator of inflammation, helping us to resist infections. In normal cells STAT3 is quiescent. In response to  infection or inflammation, it is activated transiently but soon returns to its basal state when the source of its  activation is resolved. However, in cancer cells, STAT3 activation is constitutive, facilitating several different  aspects of tumor survival and growth. We have discovered a novel mechanism for sustaining STAT3 activation  in cancer, involving its interaction with the growth factor receptor EGFR, which is also up regulated in many  cancers. We now seek to understand the details of how this interaction drives the expression of proteins that  contribute to tumorigenesis. We find that the ability of EGFR to sustain STAT3 activation is an important  contributor to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, a process that leads to an increased ability of cancers to  metastasize and to resist therapeutic drugs. This transition is facilitated by OSM, a protein that is secreted by  immune cells within tumors. OSM drives prolonged STAT3 activation by means of an interaction between its  receptor and EGFR and, consequently, high levels of OSM within tumors predict a poor outcome in patients.   In Aim 1, we will evaluate many details of the novel interaction between the receptor for OSM and  EGFR, including which proteins are expressed in response to STAT3 that is activated in this way and how  these proteins function in tumorigenesis. In Aim 2, the consequence of suppressing the ability of OSM to  activate STAT3 and induce EMT, metastasis, and resistance to chemotherapy will be assessed, using models  of human breast cancer and glioblastoma, which are well known to depend heavily upon STAT3 activation, in  immuno-compromised mice. In Aim 3, we will use mouse triple-negative breast cancers and glioblastomas in  normal mice, to determine the importance of how OSM-secreting immune cells within the tumor impact the  ability to sustain STAT3 activation and affect tumorigenesis in general. Our studies will significantly advance  current understanding of how OSM drives aberrant STAT3 activation, leading thus to cancer progression and  metastasis. This knowledge should facilitate new therapeutic approaches aimed at suppressing this important  signaling cascade.","1876106; ","STARK, GEORGE ROBERT;","","08/15/1994","03/31/2021","Affect; Animals; cancer cell; Cancer stem cell; Cells; Chemicals; chemotherapy; Complex; cytokine; defined contribution; Docking; Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor; Epithelial; epithelial to mesenchymal transition; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Transcription; Glioblastoma; Grant; Growth; Growth Factor Receptors; Human; IL6ST gene; Immune; Infection; Infiltration; Inflammation; Inflammation Mediators; Inflammatory Response; inhibitor/antagonist; Interleukin-6; JAK1 gene; JAK2 gene; Knowledge; Ligands; malignant breast neoplasm; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; Mesenchymal; Modeling; mouse model; Mus; Mutate; Neoplasm Metastasis; neoplastic cell; Normal Cell; novel; novel therapeutic intervention; Oncogene Activation; Oncogenes; oncostatin M; Outcome; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phenotype; Phenylalanine; Phosphorylation; Phosphotransferases; prevent; Process; Property; protein expression; protein function; Proteins; receptor; Receptor Activation; receptor function; Receptor Signaling; Recurrence; Resistance; response; Risk; Role; Signal Transduction; Site; Source; STAT3 gene; Therapeutic; triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma; tumor; Tumor Expansion; tumor heterogeneity; tumor microenvironment; tumor progression; tumorigenesis; Tyrosine; ","How does EGFR facilitate the constitutive activation of STAT3 in tumors?","062220","ZCA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","7591","","21","318571","186364","","504935"

An estimated one in three people who undergo DL do not get well and often undergo repeated surgery.1,3-6 Some studies indicate that conditions outside of the spine (e.g., depression, hip arthritis) cause people who undergo DL to do poorly,27,30-36 but no one has comprehensively examined these conditions or the impact of treating them on DL outcomes. Thus LSS treatment continues to focus on the spine alone.61 The aim of this study is to identify conditions other than LSS that place veterans at risk of poor DL outcomes so that future comparative effectiveness studies can be designed that examine the impact of a more comprehensive approach to treatment.

One of these enzymes, known as caspase-3, stands at the center of the cell death program. Thus, to monitor the final commitment of cells to death pathways, the need exists to directly quantify the enzymatic activity of caspase-3 in vivo. To meet this challenge, we have designed and synthesized a new class of peptide- based imaging agents that can silently penetrate cells, gaining access to interior cellular compartments and be activated specifically by caspase-3 to emit visible fluorescence. We discovered that upon intraocular administration, our cell-penetrating peptides preferentially accumulate in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the retinal neurons which are selectively injured and degenerate in glaucoma Thus, we plan to translate this property of our peptides in retinal pathology for clinical molecular imaging applications.

In order to determine whether Fish Oil has antidepressant properties, or enhances conventional antidepressants, we will explore a possible cellular mechanism whereby both fish oil and marketed antidepressant compounds exert their effect. We will investigate the actions of two omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid components of fish oil in a unique, cell based biomarker system we have developed. This will be done alone and in combination with one class of antidepressants, in order to determine whether, as our preliminary results indicate, fish oil enhances antidepressant efficacy. We will also attempt to translate this biomarker into one indicative of treatment response by examining peripheral tissue from an NIMH-funded clinical study on the antidepressant effects of poly unsaturated fatty acids. Finally, we will test these effects on cells derived from depressed patients with known response (or lack of response) to antidepressants. Results from these investigations will provide important information about a cellular mechanism that may be responsible for the purported efficacy of omega- 3 fatty acids in the treatment of major depressive disorder. They will also help us to establish a simple blood biomarker that can objectively identify both depression and antidepressant response (whether to alternative/complimentary or to allopathic treatment).","1860545; ","RASENICK, MARK M.;","PONTZER, CAROL H","09/30/2015","09/29/2019","Acylation; Adenylate Cyclase; Aftercare; Animal Model; antidepressant effect; Antidepressive Agents; Autopsy; base; Biochemical; Biological; Biological Assay; Biological Markers; Biological Models; biosignature; Blood; Blood Cells; Blood Platelets; Blood Tests; Cell Line; Cell membrane; Cells; cellular imaging; Chemosensitization; Chimeric Proteins; Cholesterol; Chronic; Citalopram; Clinical; clinical efficacy; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials; cost; Cultured Cells; Data; Depressed mood; depressed patient; design; Detergents; Development; Dietary Supplementation; Disease; Dose; Drug Exposure; Effectiveness; Enrollment; Environment; Erythrocytes; Etiology; Evaluation; Exposure to; Fish Oils; Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching; Foundations; Fractionation; Funding; Goals; GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs; GTP-Binding Proteins; Health; Human; Image; In Vitro; in vivo; Individual; individual patient; innovation; Investigation; Ketamine; Liquid substance; Location; lymphoblast; Major Depressive Disorder; Marketing; Measures; Mediating; Membrane; Membrane Lipids; Membrane Microdomains; Mental Depression; Modification; Monitor; N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid; National Institute of Mental Health; Neuroglia; novel; Omega-3 Fatty Acids; Peripheral; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phenotype; Placebos; Population; pre-clinical; preclinical study; predictive modeling; Property; Recording of previous events; Reporting; research study; response; Risk; Sampling; screening; Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor; Severities; Signal Transduction; Speed; Suggestion; Supplementation; System; Testing; Therapeutic; Time; time use; Tissues; Translating; Treatment Efficacy; treatment response; Unsaturated Fatty Acids; Work; ","Mechanism of Action for n-3 PUFA antidepressant properties","009169","APDA","Adult Psychopathology and Disorders of Aging Study Section ","","","02","256553","153675","410228",""

If successful, this approach will lead to a paradigm shift in regenerative medicine and help to overcome the shortage of tissues and organs available for donation.","1879542; ","IZPISUA BELMONTE, JUAN CARLOS ;","BLONDEL, OLIVIER ","09/30/2016","07/31/2021","Address; Animals; Architecture; base; blastocyst; blastomere structure; Cell Lineage; Cell Therapy; cell type; Cells; clinical application; clinical practice; clinically relevant; Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats; Development; Event; Evolution; Family suidae; gene discovery; Gene Expression; Generations; Genes; Genetic Programming; genome editing; Genome engineering; Histocompatibility Testing; Human; In Vitro; in vivo; induced pluripotent stem cell; Injection of therapeutic agent; knockout animal; Lead; Mediating; meetings; Messenger RNA; Molecular Genetics; Nature; novel; Organ; Organ Donor; Pluripotent Stem Cells; Production; Regenerative Medicine; Replacement Therapy; Safety; spatiotemporal; System; Technology; Tissues; tool; Work; zygote; ","Generation of functional human organs and tissues using interspecific blastocyst complementation","113616","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","500000","470000","970000",""

In the parent R01, due to lack of structural information, we proposed to use computational methods of modeling IN-INI1 interactions. The revision to R01 is due to the fact that we recently obtained three- dimensional structure of IN binding domain of INI1, which provides new opportunities and invaluable tools to gain insights into the structural basis of IN-INI1 interactions.

Despite optimal treatments, the median survival of GBM patients remains less than 16 months due to therapeutic resistance and rapid tumor recurrence. C-Myc oncoprotein plays critical roles in promoting malignant growth and therapeutic resistance in GBM. As c-Myc is a transcription factor and is required for normal cell growth, therapeutic targeting of c-Myc is very difficult. We have identified a c-Myc upstream regulator called USP13 (a deubiquitinating enzyme) that is preferentially expressed in glioma stem cells (GSCs). Thus, targeting USP13 to selectively disrupt c-Myc in GSCs could provide a unique approach. Our goal is to evaluate the therapeutic potential of USP13 inhibition in a preclinical study. We will determine whether targeting USP13 can serve as an effective therapeutic strategy to improve treatment for GBM patients.","8662503; ","BAO, SHIDENG ;","FOUNTAIN, JANE W.","09/30/2016","06/30/2021","c-myc Genes; cancer cell; Cell Death; cell growth; Cell Maintenance; Cell Proliferation; Cells; conventional therapy; Data; Deubiquitinating Enzyme; Deubiquitination; Glioblastoma; Glioma; Goals; Growth; Heterogeneity; Human; Immune; improved; in vivo; Maintenance; Malignant - descriptor; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; mutant; neoplastic cell; nerve stem cell; Normal Cell; Oncogenes; outcome forecast; overexpression; Patients; Phenotype; Play; Population; Post-Translational Protein Processing; Post-Translational Regulation; pre-clinical; preclinical study; Primary Brain Neoplasms; Property; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc; Radiation; Radioresistance; Recurrence; Regulation; Resistance; Role; self-renewal; small hairpin RNA; stem cell differentiation; Stem cells; stemness; Testing; Therapeutic; therapeutic target; therapy resistant; transcription factor; Treatment Efficacy; tumor; Tumor Angiogenesis; tumor growth; Tumor Suppression; tumorigenic; ubiquitin-protein ligase; ubiquitin-specific protease; Ubiquitination; Xenograft procedure; ","Ubiquitination and Deubiquitination of c-Myc in Glioblastoma","099175","CAMP","Cancer Molecular Pathobiology Study Section ","","","01","218750","127969","346719",""

This R21 application aims to explore deficits of complex, higher- order, cognitive processes after frontal lobe experimental TBI, such as cognitive flexibility and behavioral inhibition, and to begin to address mechanistic questions regarding altered neurotransmission responsible for such behavioral impairments by restoring cognitive performance with chronic treatment of milnacipran, a novel, dual serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. Integrating animal models of higher-order cognitive processing in the standard neurotrauma behavioral battery after TBI is paramount to investigate complex cognitive problems and finding novel therapeutic targets more relevant to the clinic, and therefore these proposed exploratory/developmental studies will be carried out in males and females, an approach which may prove extremely valuable for successful translation from bench to bedside and advanced rehabilitation research.","10431769; ","BONDI, CORINA OANA;","BELLGOWAN, PATRICK S.

PROJECT NARRATIVE Tuberculosis (TB) is a global health crisis that has frustrated efforts to treat and contain, and, unlike other bacterial infections that can be treated with a week-long course of a single antibiotic, TB therapy requires several drugs in combination for at least 6 months and often even this regimen does not work. Several front- line TB drugs target a structure called the mycomembrane and in this project we will: (1) study how TB drugs alter the structure of the mycomembrane using a model of tuberculosis in zebrafish, and (2) develop a better detection method for active TB in patient sputum samples through collaboration with a group in South Africa that works with TB-infected and HIV/TB-coinfected patients. Our new method for clinical TB diagnosis should make it easier to determine whether TB drugs are working in patients; additionally, if they are not working well, new insight gleaned from this work may help us to better understand why.","1922998; ","BERTOZZI, CAROLYN R;","LACOURCIERE, KAREN A.","04/01/2002","08/31/2021","accurate diagnosis; Achievement; active method; Adult; Affect; Antibiotics; Bacteria; Bacterial Infections; base; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell Wall; Cells; Chemicals; Chronic; Clinical; Clinical Treatment; Collaborations; Combined Modality Therapy; Detection; Development; Diagnosis; Diagnostic tests; Disease; Drug effect disorder; drug efficacy; Drug resistance; drug sensitivity; Drug Targeting; Epigenetic Process; Ethambutol; Eye; field study; Genus Mycobacterium; Glean; global health; Glycolipids; Grant; Growth; HIV; HIV-1; Human; Image; Image Analysis; imaging agent; imaging modality; In Vitro; in vivo; in vivo imaging; Infection; insight; isoniazid; Killings; Knowledge; Label; Life; Lung diseases; Metabolic; Methods; Modeling; Molecular; Monitor; mycobacterial; Mycobacterium marinum; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; mycolate; pathogen; Pathogenesis; Patients; Peptidoglycan; Performance; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacotherapy; point of care; Production; Property; Reagent; Regimen; Reporting; Resistance; response; Sampling; South Africa; spatiotemporal; Sputum; Staging; Structure; System; tool; Trehalose; Tuberculosis; tuberculosis drugs; tuberculosis treatment; Virulence; Work; Zebrafish; ","Chemical Mycobateriology","051622","SBCB","Synthetic and Biological Chemistry B Study Section ","","","15","353658","187345","541003",""

MMT peers who have successfully navigated through these barriers and are physically active can share information, help in problem solving barriers, act as role models, and offer support and encouragement, thereby helping inactive MMT patients increase self-efficacy and motivation for sustaining PA.

There are currently no treatments for FTD, no treatments that arrest AD progression and no proven treatments that can therapeutically elevate PRGN in haploinsufficient subjects.","12199166; ","ROSENTHAL, ARNON ;","REFOLO, LORENZO ","09/30/2016","08/31/2017","Acute; Affect; Affinity; Aging; Alleles; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's disease model; American; Antibodies; Antibody Formation; Behavior; Behavioral; behavioral impairment; Binding; Blocking Antibodies; Caring; Cell surface; Cells; Cellular Assay; Characteristics; Chronic; Clinic; Clinical; Cognition; cognitive performance; Conditioned Culture Media; Data Set; Dementia; Development; Diagnosis; Disease; Disease model; Disease Progression; Drug Exposure; Drug Kinetics; effective therapy; Emotional; Endocytosis; extracellular; Frontotemporal Dementia; Funding; Generations; Goals; Health; Human; Hybridomas; improved; In Vitro; in vitro Assay; in vivo; Language; Late Onset Alzheimer Disease; Lead; Life; Measures; Medical; Memory impairment; Monoclonal Antibodies; Motor; Movement; Mus; Mutation; Nerve Degeneration; nervous system disorder; Neurodegenerative Disorders; neuroinflammation; neurotrophic factor; novel; Patients; PGRN gene; Pharmacodynamics; Phase; Plasma; Preclinical Testing; Presenile Dementia; Production; Progressive Disease; Property; Proteins; Public Health; receptor; Risk Factors; Secure; Signal Transduction; sortilin; stable cell line; Surface Plasmon Resonance; Symptoms; tau Proteins; Technology; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic antibodies; Yeasts; ","SORT1:PGRN blocking antibodies for Frontotemporal dementia","050363","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","","","1294191",""

Knowledge of the normal circuitry provides a foundation for understanding the causes of impaired brain function and developing corrective measures. Our studies of the normal circuitry between early visual cortical areas will provide greater insight into the causes and effects of central vision defects when these circuits are damaged by stroke or other neurological or developmental cause. In particular, our studies of feedback circuits between different visual cortical areas will help our understanding of how these pathways mediate the influence of stimulus context on neuronal responsivity, spatial integration, and changes in visual sensitivity associated with top-down attention and learning. The optogenetic studies proposed in this application represent the first attempts to understand the mechanisms of function of feedback circuits in the non-human primate brain. Understanding how these circuits operate in normal vision will provide a foundation for understanding the consequences of their dysfunction in disorders of brain function such as autism, schizophrenia, and attention deficits disorders, which have been directly linked to abnormalities in inter-areal connectivity.","6987105; ","ANGELUCCI, ALESSANDRA ;","FLANDERS, MARTHA C","03/01/2016","02/28/2021","Address; Affect; Algorithms; Anatomy; Area; area striata; area V2; Attention; Attention Deficit Disorder; attentional modulation; Autistic Disorder; Axon; Back; base; Biological Models; Brain; Brain Diseases; cell type; Cells; Cerebral cortex; Code; Conflict (Psychology); cytochrome c oxidase; Data; Defect; Development; extrastriate visual cortex; Feedback; Foundations; Frequencies; Functional disorder; Genes; Goals; Human; imaging Segmentation; insight; Knowledge; Label; Lead; Learning; Lesion; Link; Macaca; Maps; Measures; Mediating; Methods; Modeling; Monkeys; Neurologic; Neurons; nonhuman primate; novel; Opsin; optic imaging; optogenetics; Output; Pathway interactions; Photic Stimulation; Presynaptic Terminals; Process; Property; Proteins; receptive field; Reporting; Resolution; response; Role; Schizophrenia; segregation; Space Perception; spatial integration; spatiotemporal; Specificity; Staining method; Stains; Stimulus; stroke; Structure; Synaptophysin; System; Testing; Thalamic structure; theories; Thick; Tracer; Travel; V1 neuron; vector; Viral; Viral Vector; Vision; Visual; Visual Cortex; visual process; visual processing; visual stimulus; Visual system structure; Work; ","Anatomical and functional organization of inter-areal feedback circuits in the visual cortex, and their impact on neuronal responses","026812","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","S1","01","109999","","109999",""

In 2011 alone, CKD was responsible for 92,000 deaths and cost $34 billion in healthcare expenditures. While high blood pressure affects one in three Americans and is the second leading cause of CKD, only half of hypertensives receive adequate medical management. Thus, blood pressure control falls short as a mainstay of prevention. This observation highlights the need for innovative approaches for preventing or treating CKD, including strategies to reduce renal inflammation and structural remodeling caused by hypertension. Using highly-relevant animal models of hypertension, rigorous in vitro studies of fibrogenic signaling, and unambiguous analytical methods, this proposal seeks to define the key interactions between inflammatory cell infiltration, reduction-oxidation imbalance, and fibrogenic changes, all under the umbrella of therapeutic intervention with electrophilic nitro- fatty acids. The results of this study will directly contribute to the conceptual advancement and practical development of disease-modifying strategies using electrophilic lipid mediators for hypertensive CKD.","11478966; ","JOBBAGY, SOMA ;","RANKIN, TRACY L.","09/30/2015","09/29/2019","Accounting; Address; Adult; Affect; American; analytical method; Angiotensin II; Angiotensin Receptor; Animal Model; Antioxidants; Architecture; Area; base; Behavior; Biochemistry; Biological Markers; Biomechanics; Blood Pressure; blood pressure regulation; Cause of Death; CCL2 gene; Cells; Cessation of life; Chemical Agents; Chronic; Chronic Disease; Chronic Kidney Failure; Clinical; clinical application; Collagen; connective tissue growth factor; coping; coronary fibrosis; cost; cytokine; Data; Deoxycorticosterone; Deposition; design; Development; Dietary Fats; Disease; DOCA; Electrons; Epidemic; Expenditure; Experimental Models; Extracellular Matrix; Extravasation; Failure; falls; Family; Fatty Acids; Fibroblasts; Fibronectins; Fibrosis; Gene Expression; Gene Targeting; Genes; Genetic; Glean; Healthcare; Homologous Gene; Hormonal; Hypertension; Immunohistochemistry; In Vitro; Infiltration; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Inflammatory Response; inhibitor/antagonist; Injury; innovation; insight; Intercellular adhesion molecule 1; Interleukin-1 beta; Interleukin-13; Interleukin-4; Interleukin-6; Intervention; Isoprostanes; Kidney; kidney cell; Kidney Failure; Knockout Mice; Leukocyte Adhesion Molecules; Leukocyte-Adhesion Receptors; Leukocytes; lipid mediator; Lipid Peroxidation; Losartan; loss of function; macrophage; MAP Kinase Gene; MAPK14 gene; Measures; Mechanics; Mediating; Medical; Methods; mouse model; Mus; NADPH Oxidase; NF-kappa B; nitration; nitroalkene; novel; Nuclear; Oleic Acids; Oral; Organ Model; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidative Stress; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Physiology; Platelet-Derived Growth Factor; pressure; prevent; Prevention; Process; Production; protective effect; Proteins; public health relevance; Randomized; Reactive Oxygen Species; Renal function; Research; response; Role; Serum Markers; Signal Transduction; Signaling Molecule; Small Interfering RNA; Smooth Muscle Actin Staining Method; Sodium Chloride; Solid; Source; Spin Trapping; standard of care; Stimulus; Stress; Sulfhydryl Compounds; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Intervention; Tissues; TNF gene; transcription factor; Transforming Growth Factor beta; Transforming Growth Factors; Treatment Efficacy; treatment strategy; United States; Up-Regulation; urinary; Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1; Wound Healing; ","Protective effects of nitro-oleic acid in hypertensive chronic kidney injury","108391","ZDK1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","48576","","48576",""

Obesity is a major risk factor for mobility problems. It is estimated that 11 million older adults have a mobility disability and four million use walking assistive devices. Dietary programs that restrict caloric intake have been successful in achieving weight loss. However, some research has shown that weight loss can result in loss of muscle mass which may reduce physical function. This could be detrimental to older obese Veterans with mobility disability. There has been little research on the effectiveness of a combined exercise and weight loss program in older obese Veterans who use assistive devices. We believe that our novel multimodality balance intervention along with a structured weight loss program will be effective at reducing weight and improving walking speed, balance, strength and quality of life in obese, older Veterans with mobility disability.","1901034; ","KATZEL, LESLIE I.;","","10/01/2016","09/30/2020","Abdomen; Adult; Aerobic; Age; American; Area; Baltimore; base; Biological Markers; Biomechanics; Body Composition; Body fat; Body Weight decreased; Capsicum; Cessation of life; Clinical; clinical care; Collaborations; Communities; Comorbidity; deconditioning; Diet; Dietary Intervention; Dietitian; disability; Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry; education research; effective intervention; Effectiveness; Elderly; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Enrollment; Equilibrium; Exercise; Exercise intervention; exercise rehabilitation; experience; fall risk; Fatigue; Fatty acid glycerol esters; fitness; functional status; Gait; Gait speed; Geriatrics; Goals; group intervention; Hip region structure; Hospitalization; Human; improved; improved functioning; improving mobility; Individual; Injury; instrument; Intervention; intervention program; Intramuscular; Isometric Exercise; Laboratories; Lateral; Lead; Lower Extremity; Maryland; Measurement; Measures; Mediation; Medical; Medical center; Methods; Movement; multidisciplinary; multimodality; Muscle; muscle form; novel; nutrition; Nutritional; Obesity; Outcome Measure; Overweight; Patient Self-Report; Performance; Physical activity; Physical Function; Physiological; Prevalence; programs; Quality of life; Randomized; Randomized Clinical Trials; Research; Resources; Risk Factors; Robotics; sarcopenia; sarcopenic obesity; Scanning; Self-Help Devices; Spiral Computed Tomography; Step Tests; Structure; System; Testing; Thigh structure; Time; Translating; Universities; Upper Extremity; Veterans; Walking; walking speed; Weight; X-Ray Computed Tomography; ","Multimodal Exercise and Weight Loss in Older Veterans with Dysmobility","001813","RRD6","Blank ","","A1","01","","","",""

The current project aims to investigate a novel mechanism whereby mitochondria regulate energy metabolism, and to understand why nutrient surplus damages mitochondria.

The results of the proposed project could lay the groundwork for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent and/or mitigate mitochondrial dysfunction in the context of aging and chronic metabolic disease.","12043036; ","FISHER-WELLMAN, KELSEY ;","CASTLE, ARTHUR ","09/30/2015","09/29/2018","Ablation; Acetylation; Acyl Coenzyme A; Acylation; Aging; ATP Synthesis Pathway; Burn injury; Caloric Restriction; Chronic; Citrates; Citric Acid Cycle; Computer Simulation; Coupled; Data; Data Set; Development; Diet; Disease; Employee Strikes; Energy Metabolism; enzyme activity; Enzymes; Event; exercise intolerance; Failure; Fatty acid glycerol esters; fatty acid oxidation; feeding; Fiber; follow-up; Functional disorder; Genetic; genetic approach; Heart Diseases; High Fat Diet; Homeostasis; Hydrogen Peroxide; Isocitrate Dehydrogenase; Kinetics; Knock-out; Knockout Mice; Link; Liver; Lysine; Malonyl Coenzyme A; malonyl-CoA decarboxylase; Mass Spectrum Analysis; Mediating; Metabolic; Metabolic Diseases; Mitochondria; mitochondrial dysfunction; mitochondrial metabolism; Mitochondrial Proteins; Modeling; Modification; mouse model; Mus; Muscle; National Research Service Awards; Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; novel; novel therapeutics; Nutrient; Obesity; Organ; oxidation; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidoreductase; Peptides; Phenotype; Physiology; Post-Translational Protein Processing; Predisposition; prevent; Proteins; Public Health; public health relevance; Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex; Reporting; research study; respiratory; Respiratory physiology; Role; Site; Skeletal Muscle; Testing; Tissues; Western Blotting; ","Role of Protein Malonylation in Regulating Mitochondrial Function","105665","ZDK1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","58002","","58002",""

Among other drugs, the abuse of prescription opiate analgesics has significantly increased over the last decade, and ~2.1 million Americans are dependent on prescription opioids. The prescription opioids oxycodone and hydrocodone also act as gateway drugs to heroin use. Compared to existing medications, therapeutic vaccines for opiates have the potential to provide a low-cost, long-lasting, safe, and effective intervention that lacks CNS-related side effects, abuse liability, and diversion. Due to their selectivity for the targeted opioid and different mechanism of action, vaccines may also be used in combination with methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone. This Strategic Alliance seeks funding to develop a next-generation vaccine for prescription opioid abuse by a two-pronged approach: 1) combining a lead oxycodone-based immunogen with immunomodulators to enhance the quantity and quality of the post- vaccination anti-drug antibody response, and 2) the best immunotherapeutic cocktail will be formulated in novel gelling polymers to increase vaccine efficacy by focusing delivery of vaccine components to the injection site, prevent systemic effects of interleukins and immunomodulators, and create a depot for sustained release.","10993660; ","PRAVETONI, MARCO ;","RAPAKA, RAO ","09/30/2016","05/31/2019","adaptive immunity; addiction; Adjuvant; Adopted; Adverse effects; Affinity; American; Antibodies; Antibody Response; Antigen-Presenting Cells; Antigens; Autoimmune Diseases; B cell differentiation; B-Cell Activation; B-Lymphocytes; base; Behavioral; Binding; Biocompatible; Brain; Buprenorphine; cancer immunotherapy; Carrier Proteins; cGMP production; Chemistry; Clinical; clinical efficacy; Cocaine; Corpus striatum structure; cost; Crime; Cyclic GMP; cytokine; Data; Development; Disease; Dopamine; Dose; Drug Addiction; drug distribution; drug induced behavior; effective intervention; efficacy testing; Environment; expectation; Formulation; Frequencies; Funding; Gel; Generations; Goals; Haptens; Healthcare; Heroin; HIV; Hydrocodone; Hydrolysis; Immune; Immune system; Immunization; immunogenic; immunogenicity; Immunology; Immunomodulators; Immunotherapeutic agent; improved; Injectable; Injection of therapeutic agent; innovation; Interleukin 2 Receptor; Interleukin-2; interleukin-21; Interleukin-4; Interleukins; Intervention; Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin; Lead; Ligands; Liposomes; Lymphoid; Malaria; Malignant Neoplasms; meetings; Methadone; Modeling; Monoclonal Antibodies; Mus; Naltrexone; nanoparticle; Nicotine; novel; novel vaccines; Opiate Addiction; Opiates; Opioid; Opioid Analgesics; Opioid Receptor; Organ; Ownership; Oxycodone; Pain; Pathway interactions; Patients; Peptides; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Polymers; Pre-Clinical Model; preclinical study; preference; prescription opiate; prescription opioid; prescription opioid abuse; prevent; Productivity; Proteins; public health relevance; Rattus; receptor; screening; Selection Criteria; Self Administration; Serum; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Site; Speed; Staging; Structure of germinal center of lymph node; Substance abuse problem; Substance Use Disorder; success; T cell differentiation; T-Lymphocyte; Technology; Testing; therapeutic vaccine; TNFRSF5 gene; TNFSF5 gene; tool; Translations; Treatment outcome; United States; Vaccination; vaccine delivery; vaccine efficacy; Vaccines; Work; ","Enhancing efficacy of vaccines for substance abuse through polymer-assisted delivery of immunomodulators","041730","ZDA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","385694","53507","439201",""

Influenza and other respiratory infections are believed to be the cause of substantial portion of morbidity and mortality in developing countries but there is no specific information on influenza disease burden in sub-Saharan countries including Ghana. The little data available has been gathered from nascent hospital based surveillance for ARI following the pandemic influenza of 2009. Knowledge of the epidemiology, treatment and prevention of respiratory infections will assist in producing reliable estimates of the burden of ALRI to inform the preparation of national preparedness plans against influenza epidemics. We intend to explore a population-based cohort to estimate the incidence of influenza infection in the DWD and a health facility based prospective surveillance to estimate the rate of severe influenza in the community. We will use these studies to document among other things the occurrence of influenza like illness in the population, the hospitalization rate of severe influenza, the burden of influenza and risk factors for severe influenza as well as evaluate case definitions for influenza and other respiratory pathogens in the DWD. In addition we will characterize influenza and other respiratory pathogens in patients with co-morbid and chronic conditions such as HIV/AIDs, Tuberculosis and Diabetes. We will also conduct studies on the immune response to influenza virus infection in the population. The studies will be initiated in the Dangme West District, a district which has one of the Demographic Surveillance Systems is sited in the country and subsequently transitioned to two other demographic surveillance sites in Kintampo and Navrongo in the middle belt and the northern guinea savannah respectively. We hope to obtain comprehensive data on the epidemiology, treatment and prevention of influenza and other respiratory infections in Ghana, including the hospitalization rate of severe influenza, the burden of influenza and risk factors for severe influenza. We will also obtain data to evaluate case definitions for influenza and other respiratory pathogens in the Dodowa district and characterize influenza and other respiratory pathogens in patients with co-morbid and chronic conditions such as HIV/AIDs, Tuberculosis and Diabetes. Taken together, the data from these studies will enable us to determine the relative importance of influenza and other respiratory pathogens as causes of ill health in the country as well as strengthen the capabilities of the Institute to conduct training fr other sites in the West African sub-region.","11262739; ","AMPOFO, WILLIAM KWABENA;","LOVEYS, DEBORAH ","09/30/2012","09/29/2017","","Epidemiology, Prevention and Treatment of Influenza and Other Respiratory Infecti","000607","ZIP1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","05","","","400000",""

The current proposal aims to validate a novel spinal cord imaging technique to improve diagnosis and prognostication in SCI. We anticipate that this study will help us delineate changes in spinal cord architecture after SCI, thereby establishing the biological basis for altered imaging indices measured using diffusion tensor imaging.

The vast majority of those individuals will be prescribed anti-inflammatory drugs that provide some pain relief but do not slow the progression of the disease. Often people with knee arthritis are told they must live with the pain until they become appropriate candidates for knee replacement surgery, but that can require tolerating the pain and limiting function for many years. Because of other health issues, some individuals are never acceptable surgery candidates. What is desperately needed are better conservative approaches for treating these patients. Ideally those treatments will provide not only pain relief, but also will slow disease progression.

Our device is composed of two neodymium magnets. One is encased in titanium and affixed to the patient's sternum during a 1 hour operation. The second is attached to an orthotic brace that is held in place by the attraction of the two magnets. Over the course of a two year treatment the chestwall is moved back into a near normal position. We have shown that the device is beneficial to a specific group of PE patients, usually those between the ages of 8 and 14 who have not gone through their pubertal spirt yet. During both trials the mechanism (screw then cables) that affixed the internal to the sternum broke. During the second trial the magnet became encased on the patient's chest and the cable breakage did not affect the completion of the trial. In face the patients' chests continued to improve even though the cables holding it in place did not break. It turned out that patient respirations over about 16,000,000 in two years, were responsible for the cable damage in trial two. The FDA is requesting a third patient study to show that a new device would be considered safe during the entire trial. We will be developing a third no-cost trial with the Shriners Hospital system. We are developing a new implant that uses neither a screw nor a cable to hold in in place on the sternum. Three dimensional modeling and a library of CT scans from our two trails are being used to help create a simpler stronger implant. These tools and the participation of orthopedic researchers, skilled in bone remodeling are helping us to better understand the stresses associated with respiratory movement during the trial. We believe that this third design will overcome the issues experienced in our earlier trials and more the device closer to commercialization.","1962261; ","HARRISON, MICHAEL R;","BALDWIN, TIM ","09/28/2016","08/31/2017","Affect; Age; Alloys; Analgesics; Back; base; Biomechanics; bone; Bone Diseases; Bone remodeling; Boron; Breathing; Caliber; Cartilage; Chest; Chest wall structure; Clinical Trials; commercialization; Congenital funnel chest; cost; Custom; Deformity; design; Devices; Evaluation; Exhalation; experience; Face; Funding; Goals; Home environment; Hospitals; Hour; Housing; Implant; improved; injured; Institutional Review Boards; Iron; Learning; Legal patent; Length; Length of Stay; Libraries; Magnetism; Measurement; Mechanics; Modification; Monitor; Movement; Neodymium; operation; Operative Surgical Procedures; Orphan; Orthodontics; Orthopedics; orthotics; Outcome; Outpatients; Patients; Phase; Play; Positioning Attribute; Postoperative Period; Procedures; Process; Protocols documentation; repaired; Research Personnel; Research Project Grants; Respiration; respiratory; Role; Series; Shapes; Small Business Innovation Research Grant; Sterilization; Sternum; Stress; System; Teenagers; Testing; Thick; three-dimensional modeling; Titania; Titanium; tool; Work; X-Ray Computed Tomography; ","Magnetic Mini Mover Device for the Treatment of Pectus Excavatum","134520","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","","","825332",""

Empirical data from a broad spectrum of stakeholders are essential to the development of effective policies and programs. A major objective of this project is to advance our understanding of the perspectives of research scientists, health professionals, SCD patients and community populations within our collaborative network concerning both genomic research and the public health aspects of SCD. We will employ qualitative research methods to pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1: Explore perspectives and attitudes regarding genomic research and its implementation and implications in Cameroon, Ghana, and Tanzania.  Aim 2: Assess perceptions about public health interventions to increase awareness, early detection, and prevention of SCD-related complications. This research is the first phase of a series of longitudinal, mixed method studies exploring individual, family, community, and professional perspectives on genomic research and SCD-related public health interventions. This formative research will help us to define the most effective strategies for: 1) implementing genomic research and addressing the pertinent issues and 2) insuring informed decision-making about and optimal uptake of newborn screening, other public health interventions for SCD, and the related services","11210597; ","WONKAM, AMBROISE ;","MADDEN, EBONY B","09/20/2013","07/31/2017","Address; Affect; Africa; African; Age; Attention; Attitude; Awareness; Basic Science; benefit sharing; biobank; Birth; Cameroon; Child; Clinical Research; cohort; Communities; Complex; cost effective; Country; Data; Decision Making; Development; Diagnosis; Dimensions; Disease; Early Diagnosis; Economics; Ensure; Ethics; exome; Family; Family member; Future; Genetic; genetic information; Genetic study; genome sequencing; genome wide association study; genomic data; Genomics; Ghana; Health; Health Professional; improved; Incidental Findings; Individual; information gathering; Informed Consent; interest; Intervention; Legal; Literature; Longevity; member; Methods; Neonatal Screening; Newborn Infant; Ownership; Parents; Participant; Patients; Perception; Phase; Pilot Projects; Policies; Population; Prenatal Diagnosis; prevent; Prevention; Privacy; Procedures; programs; psychosocial; Psychosocial Factor; Psychosocial Influences; Public Health; public health intervention; public health research; Publishing; Qualitative Research; Religion and Spirituality; Research; Research Methodology; Research Personnel; Scientist; Series; Services; Sickle Cell; Sickle Cell Anemia; sickling; Staging; Tanzania; Technology; Termination of pregnancy; uptake; Work; ","Exploring Perspectives on Genomics and Sickle Cell Public Health Interventions","007459","ZHG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","S1","03","46296","3704","50000",""

At least 30,000 Americans have the disease at any given time.  There is evidence that the risk of developing ALS is affected by ancestral origin, with lower rates among Hispanic groups within the United States. This project will examine whether this is truly the case by using standardized methods developed by the European EuroMOTOR Consortium to collect information from patients with ALS from 3 different South American countries, and by comparing these patients with those from 3 European countries, and then providing these data to enable comparison with data generated from the CDC ALS Registry. The study will also examine whether the same environmental factors influence risk in different ancestral and geographic populations. Understanding how ancestral origin can influence the onset of disease and the disease subtype in Latin America will help to explain differences within the population in the United States, will open new avenues of genotype /phenotype research for ALS in the United States, and will also be helpful in developing similar research for other more common neurodegenerative diseases.","12104437; ","HARDIMAN, ORLA ;","","09/30/2016","09/29/2019","","ALS Risk in Latin Americans- A population based case control comparative study with 3 European population based cohorts.","000242","ZTS1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","","","400000",""

We have uncovered abnormalities of autophagosome maturation and lysosome fusion in SBMA cell culture models, transgenic mice, and neuronal progenitor cells derived from patient induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), documented a physical and functional interaction between normal AR and transcription factor EB (TFEB), and determined that TFEB dysregulation accounts for the autophagy defects in SBMA. In this project, we will pursue the basis for pathological interactions between skeletal muscle and motor neurons that conspire to produce neuron degeneration in SBMA by performing transcriptome analysis of conditional deletion SBMA mice; we will model non-cell autonomous degeneration in iPSC-derived skeletal muscle and motor neurons in conditioned media and co-culture paradigms; and we will determine the basis for AR co-activation of TFEB and polyQ-AR repression of TFEB by defining the normal and mutant AR interactome, and identifying co-regulators whose interactions and functions with AR and TFEB in complex are altered in the presence of polyQ-AR.","1926731; ","LA SPADA, ALBERT R;","GUBITZ, AMELIE ","09/30/2016","08/30/2021","Accounting; Actins; Androgen Antagonists; Androgen Receptor; Antisense Oligonucleotides; Autophagocytosis; Autophagosome; base; Bioinformatics; Biological; Cataloging; Catalogs; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell model; cell type; Cells; Coculture Techniques; Complex; Conditioned Culture Media; Defect; Development; Disease; disease phenotype; Excision; Exons; Functional disorder; Gene Expression; Genetic Transcription; Goals; Human; in vitro Model; in vivo; induced pluripotent stem cell; Inherited; Investigation; Kennedy Syndrome; Knock-in Mouse; Ligands; Link; Longevity; LoxP-flanked allele; Lumbar spinal cord structure; Lysosomes; Modeling; Molecular; molecular pathology; Motor; motor deficit; motor neuron degeneration; Motor Neuron Disease; Motor Neurons; mouse model; Mus; Muscle; Muscle Fibers; mutant; Nerve Degeneration; nerve stem cell; Neurodegenerative Disorders; neuromuscular; Neuromuscular Diseases; novel; Nuclear; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Patients; Performance; Peripheral; Phenotype; polyglutamine; prevent; Process; Proteins; quadriceps muscle; receptor; receptor expression; Receptor Gene; Regulation; Repression; Role; Site; skeletal; Skeletal Muscle; spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy; stem; Stem cells; Toxic effect; transcription factor; Transcriptional Regulation; transcriptome; transcriptome sequencing; transgene expression; Transgenes; Transgenic Mice; Validation; Work; ","Deconstructing the cellular and molecular basis of SBMA motor neuron disease: From mechanism to therapy","100023","CMND","Cellular and Molecular Biology of Neurodegeneration Study Section ","","","01","307357","169046","476403",""

This project will improve scientific and clinical understanding of a major cause of drug abuse/relapse, and may guide development of novel therapeutics for opioid use disorder.","1895316; ","GREENWALD, MARK K;","LYNCH, MINDA ","09/20/2003","07/31/2020","Abstinence; Acute; acute stress; Address; Adrenergic Receptor; adverse outcome; Agonist; alpha-amylase; Attenuated; attenuation; base; behavioral economics; biobehavior; biological adaptation to stress; Biological Markers; Blood; Blood Pressure; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Buprenorphine; Caliber; Cessation of life; Chronic; Chronic stress; Clinical; Clinical Research; Cognitive; Congresses; coping; cytokine; Data; design; Development; Dose; Drug abuse; Drug Interactions; Drug usage; Economics; Elasticity; Emergency department visit; follow-up; Glucocorticoids; Hair; Hydrocortisone; hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis; improved; indexing; Inflammatory; innovation; Interleukin-1 beta; Interleukin-6; Interleukins; Laboratory Animals; Maintenance; Measures; Mediator of activation protein; Methadone; Methods; Morphine; Naloxone; National Institute of Drug Abuse; negative mood; Norepinephrine; novel; novel marker; novel therapeutics; Opioid; opioid abuse; opioid misuse; Opioid Rotation; opioid use; opioid use disorder; Oral; Outpatients; Overdose; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase; Placebo Control; Placebos; Plasma; Play; preclinical study; Predisposition; Price; prospective; Psychological reinforcement; Public Health; Pupil; Questionnaires; Randomized; Relapse; relapse prediction; relapse risk; Research; response; Risk Factors; Role; Saliva; Self Efficacy; Stress; stress reactivity; stressor; Subutex; System; Testing; Therapeutic; TimeLine; TNF gene; Treatment Efficacy; Treatment outcome; United States National Institutes of Health; United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration; Urinalysis; volunteer; Withdrawal; Yohimbine; ","Biobehavioral Studies of Opioid Seeking: Effects of Buprenorphine/Naloxone Dose on Experimental Stress Reactivity and Opioid Abstinence","015462","ARM","Addiction Risks and Mechanisms Study Section ","","A1","09","406292","211188","617480",""

However, the molecules that specifically carry this non-genetic information across generations are unknown. By using a robust paradigm of epigenetic inheritance in the genetically tractable C. elegans we can define basic conserved mechanisms of transgenerational inheritance. We have discovered N6- methyladenine (6mA) as a new DNA modification that occurs in Metazoa and identified enzymes that regulate the addition and removal of this modification. The proposed research will characterize the effect of 6mA on transcription and chromatin structure and will examine its potential role as a carrier of epigenetic information in transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. Because the regulation of chromatin is a highly conserved process, it is likely that these proposed studies will help to define basic mechanisms of transgenerational inheritance. This work will lay a foundation for understanding this process in more complex systems, including inherited disorders in humans.","8148709; ","GREER, ERIC LIEBERMAN;","GUO, MAX ","09/30/2016","06/30/2021","abstracting; Adenine; Appearance; Behavioral; Caenorhabditis elegans; Chromatin; Chromatin Structure; Complex; demethylation; DNA; DNA Methylation; DNA Modification Process; Energy Metabolism; Enzymes; epigenetic memory; Epigenetic Process; epigenetic regulation; Eukaryota; Excision; Foundations; Generations; genetic information; Genetic Transcription; Genomics; Health; Human; Inborn Genetic Diseases; Label; Location; Longevity; Memory; Metabolic; Methylation; Modification; Molecular; Nematoda; non-genetic; novel; Organism; Phenotype; Positioning Attribute; Process; Public Health; Purines; Regulation; Research; Role; System; Tissues; transgenerational epigenetic inheritance; Work; zygote; ","Characterization of DNA N6-methyl adenine and its role in epigenetic memory","055947","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","1500000","1155000","2655000",""

For Veterans, nerve repair is often initiated or surgically  revised after separation from the armed forces. This timeline creates a variety of complexities associated with chronic nerve injury. This clinical scenario is understudied, lacks effective therapeutic strategies, and results in impaired motor function, sensory loss, and chronic pain. Our novel nerve regeneration strategy incorporates a new modular nerve-lengthening device, which exploits the natural capacity for nerves to grow in response to stretch. This strategy will enable more rapid and more distal connectivity of regenerating proximal stumps to degenerating distal nerve stumps, which will reduce the extent and duration of neuronal outgrowth through a highly non-permissive regenerative environment. Comprehensive biological, structural, and functional testing will evaluate the efficacy of our strategy in rat and rabbit nerve injury models as important steps towards clinical translation.","2184415; ","SHAH, SAMEER B.;","","10/01/2015","09/30/2019","Acceleration; Acute; Address; Afferent Neurons; Animal Model; arm; Autologous; Autologous Transplantation; base; Biological; Biomedical Engineering; Blast Injuries; Bypass; Cellular biology; Cervical spinal cord injury; Chronic; chronic pain; Clinical; clinical application; clinically relevant; Defect; Denervation; Device Designs; Devices; Distal; Environment; functional outcomes; Goals; Gold; Growth; Hybrids; Implant; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; injured; Injury; innovation; Internal Fixators; Isogeneic graft; Length; Limb structure; Measurement; Modeling; Morbidity - disease rate; Motor; Motor Neurons; motor recovery; Natural regeneration; Nerve; nerve gap; nerve injury; Nerve Regeneration; Neural Conduction; neuronal growth; Neuronal Plasticity; Neurons; novel; novel strategies; Oryctolagus cuniculus; outcome forecast; Pain; Peripheral nerve injury; peripheral nerve regeneration; Peripheral Nerves; Physiology; Population; Pre-Clinical Model; programs; public health relevance; Rattus; Recovery; Recovery of Function; regenerative; Regenerative Medicine; Rehabilitation therapy; repaired; Research; response; scaffold; sciatic nerve; Second Look Surgery; secondary outcome; Sensory; Site; Soldier; Source; Spinal Cord; Spinal cord injury; Stretching; Structure; Testing; Therapeutic; TimeLine; Tissues; Translations; Traumatic injury; Veterans; ","Novel Modular Nerve Lengthening Device for Peripheral Nerve Regeneration","001471","RRD0","Translational Rehab (Basic) ","","","02","","","",""

Unlike other powered exoskeletons, our ?muscle-first? design adds to the maximal contributions of user, rather than backing off total assistance from external sources as voluntary effort is applied.

The finding that active neurons in the microenvironment contribute to glioma growth through the release of NLGN3 opens numerous doors to a deeper mechanistic understanding of the role this protein plays in health and disease. Such mechanisms may include, as we investigate here, activity-regulated secretion coupled with a positive feed-forward effect on expression and activation of oncogenic signaling pathways. Neuronal-glioma cell interactions, including NLGN3 secretion and subsequent signaling in glioma cells, thus represent a novel set of therapeutic targets for this group of devastating brain tumors.","12485491; ","VENKATESH, HUMSA ;","SCHMIDT, MICHAEL K","09/30/2015","09/29/2018","Adult; Age; Binding; Biological; Brain Neoplasms; Breeding; cell behavior; Cell Communication; Cell Proliferation; cell type; Cells; Cessation of life; Child; Childhood; Childhood Glioblastoma; Cleaved cell; clinically relevant; cognitive function; Complex; Conditioned Culture Media; Coupled; CSPG4 gene; Data; Data Set; Databases; Disease; Employee Strikes; Environment; extracellular; Family; feeding; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profile; Glioma; Goals; Growth; Health; Human; in vivo; insight; knock-down; Knock-out; Knockout Mice; Location; Malignant Neoplasms; Maps; Mass Spectrum Analysis; Matrix Metalloproteinases; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; Mitogens; Modeling; mouse model; N-terminal; nerve stem cell; neurodevelopment; neuroligin 3; Neurons; new therapeutic target; novel; Oncogenic; optogenetics; Outcome; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pattern; Peptide Hydrolases; Play; postsynaptic neurons; precursor cell; Proteins; Publishing; receptor; receptor binding; Recruitment Activity; Research; research study; response; Role; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Site; Slice; spatiotemporal; Synapses; Synapsins; Testing; Therapeutic; therapeutic target; transcriptome sequencing; tumor growth; tumor microenvironment; Western Blotting; Work; Xenograft Model; Xenograft procedure; ","A Mechanistic Understanding of Neuronal Activity Promotion of High-Grade Glioma Growth through Activity-Regulated Secretion of Neuroligin-3","200273","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","43576","","43576",""

Azide salts are stockpiled throughout the US and are easily available on-line, rendering the possibility of such attacks especially worrisome. There is currently no known treatment for azide poisoning. In fact one of the treatments currently approved for a similar poison, cyanide, would be deadly instead of ameliorating.

COPD is the 3rd leading cause of death in the United States and the 6th most common chronic condition cited among veterans enrolled in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). In 2010, nearly 300,000 VA patients were diagnosed with COPD. Moreover, COPD is the 5th leading cause of VHA hospitalization. Compared with the general population, COPD patients are more likely to rate their health as poor, to report more limitations in daily activities and more disability days, to visit a physician, and to be hospitalized. In the short- term, pulmonary rehabilitation can improve several chronic hindrances of COPD. Unfortunately, is unclear how to maintain rehabilitation benefits over the long-term. We reason that developing a successful strategy to ensure long-term maintenance of physical activity and breathing-retraining in COPD, as planned in this proposal, has the potential to modify the spiraling pattern of increasing respiratory impairment leading to mounting physical limitations and, possibly, reduce health-care cost and mortality in COPD.","6110418 (contact); 9398805; ","COLLINS, EILEEN G (contact); LAGHI, FRANCO ;","","10/01/2014","09/30/2018","Adherence; Affect; Airway Obstruction; Anxiety; base; Breathing; Breathing Exercises; Cause of Death; Chronic; Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease; Clinical; clinical phenotype; design; Development; Diagnosis; Dimensions; disability; Dyspnea; Effectiveness; Enrollment; Ensure; Exercise; exercise program; Exercise Tolerance; exercise training; Exhalation; Fatigue; follow-up; functional decline; functional status; General Population; Health; health administration; Health Care Costs; Home environment; Hospitalization; Impairment; improved; Intention; interest; Intervention; intervention program; Laboratories; Linear Regressions; Maintenance; Measurement; Measures; Mental Depression; Methods; Modeling; mortality; motivational enhancement therapy; Muscle function; muscle strength; novel; Outcome Measure; Participant; Patients; Pattern; Physical activity; Physicians; Physiological; primary outcome; programs; psychologic; Psychological Factors; Pulmonary function tests; pulmonary rehabilitation; quadriceps muscle; Qualifying; Quality of life; Randomized; Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials; Rehabilitation therapy; Reporting; Research; respiratory; Respiratory Muscles; Risk; Sampling; Self Efficacy; Severities; study characteristics; Study Subject; Symptoms; Tail; Techniques; Telephone; Testing; Time; Training; treadmill; Treadmill Tests; Ultrasonography; United States; Veterans; Visit; Walking; Work; ","Sustainability of Rehabilitation Gains in COPD","001325","RRD2","Musculoskeletal/Orthopedic Rehabilitation  ","","","03","","","",""

The goal is to understand how and why older adults use a health kiosk to live a healthier lifestyle and monitor and manage their chronic conditions. Kiosks capable of adapting to their users will be situated in 9 congregate sites including senior centers, senior housing, and continuing care retirement communities in southwestern Pennsylvania. At the kiosks, older adults will be able to check and track their weight, blood pressure, oxygen saturation level, grip strength, and mobility. They will respond to health-related surveys and exchange messages with the Project Coordinator. Further, they will engage with e-health interventions designed to improve self-management, patient-provider communication, sleep, mobility and balance, physical activity and nutrition, bladder health, and mood. Periodically, summary reports of data gathered at the health kiosk will be provided to each study participant's primary care provider, to serve as a springboard for communication between patient and provider.

Emerging mechanistic studies further suggest that the two interventions together may have a synergistic, superior cognitive effect than either intervention alone.

Plasmacytoid dendritic cells are the most recent addition to armamentarium of the immune system and have a critical role in antiviral immunity, as they can directly sense viruses in peripheral tissues, and educate other protective players of the immune system, called T cells. Defining organ- and cell-specific molecular migratory mechanisms is critical, in order to inhibit cell subsets driving disease, without affecting leukocytes required for protective immunity. Identification of critical pathways of plasmacytoid dendritic cell migration in the cornea and thei role in herpetic eye disease may provide new molecular targets for pharmacological intervention in infectious, inflammatory, and autoimmune corneal diseases through highly innovative specific strategies for immunotherapy.","9743178; ","HAMRAH, PEDRAM ;","MCKIE, GEORGE ANN","09/30/2016","08/31/2018","adaptive immunity; Address; Affect; Animals; Anti-inflammatory; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Antigens; antiviral immunity; Antiviral resistance; Area; Autoimmune Diseases; Autoimmune Process; Automobile Driving; base; Blindness; Blocking Antibodies; Blood Vessels; Bone Marrow; CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes; Cell Adhesion Molecules; Cell Communication; cell motility; Cells; chemokine; Chimera organism; Cornea; Corneal Diseases; corneal scar; Critical Pathways; Data; Dendritic Cells; Destinations; Disease; Disease Outcome; effective therapy; Eye diseases; fighting; Harvest; Health; Herpetic Keratitis; Homing; Host Defense; Image; Immune; Immune response; Immune system; Immunity; Immunotherapy; in vivo; Infection; Inflammation; Inflammatory; innovation; Integrins; Interferon Type I; Interferons; Interleukin-6; Intervention; intravital microscopy; Keratitis; Kinetics; Label; Leukocytes; Life; Link; lymph nodes; macrophage; Mediating; migration; Modeling; Molecular; Molecular Target; multi-photon; Mus; novel; novel therapeutics; Organ; Participant; pathogen; Pathway interactions; Peripheral; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phenotype; Play; Population; prevent; Production; Productivity; Property; Proteins; Recombinants; Regulatory T-Lymphocyte; research study; Resolution; Role; Selectins; Signal Transduction; Simplexvirus; Source; T cell response; T-Lymphocyte; Testing; Tissues; TLR7 gene; TLR9 gene; TNF gene; Toll-like receptors; trafficking; Transgenic Mice; Transgenic Organisms; Up-Regulation; Viral; Virus; Virus Diseases; Vision; Visual impairment; Work; ","The role of plasmacytoid dendritic cells in corneal immunity","022695","","","","S1","04","63504","47628","111132",""

Based on 2011 estimates, the annual health care cost for dementia is ~$183 billion. Given this staggering cost, and the projected increase in elderly population by the year 2030, identifying effective mechanisms to ward off structural and functional declines associated with AD is an important public health goal as evidenced by recent presidential initiatives (reduce the morbidity and costs associated with, and maintain or enhance the quality of life for, persons with dementia, including Alzheimer's disease). Unfortunately, this  well-intended public health goal cannot be achieved without an effective dementia preventive strategy. Fortunately, lifestyle-induced preservation of intellectual dexterity among those showing earliest symptoms of cognitive deterioration may ameliorate the physical, emotional, and economic burden associated with loss of cognitive vitality.

The impact of this devastating disease will increase enormously as the world population continues to age. The mechanisms that contribute to post-ischemic injury and neurological dysfunction after stroke are not completely understood, and most clinical trials conducted to save neuronal function to date for stroke therapeutics have failed. Failure to consider white matter (WM) injury is a critical gap in the development of successful stroke therapy. An ideal stroke therapeutic must not only be directed towards neuronal and axonal protection across age, but also must restore function when applied after injury. Post-ischemic application of the Class I HDAC inhibitor MS-275 protects neurons, axons, and glial cells and restores function in young and aging brain by preserving mitochondria. Therefore we will determine the mechanisms of post-ischemic protection conferred by Class I HDAC inhibition in young and aging WM. The overall goal of this project is to test if Class I HDAC inhibition can be used to develop novel therapies to help aid recovery after stroke.","8597405; ","BALTAN, SELVA ;","WISE, BRADLEY C.","09/01/2010","08/31/2017","Achievement; Affect; Age; age effect; Aging; aging brain; Attenuated; Axon; base; Biochemical; Brain; Cause of Death; cell injury; cell motility; Cells; cellular targeting; Conduct Clinical Trials; deprivation; design; Development; disability; Disease; Electrophysiology (science); Epigenetic Process; excitotoxicity; experience; Failure; functional restoration; Funding; Gene Proteins; genetic approach; Genetic Transcription; Glucose; Glutamates; Goals; gray matter; Health; Histone Deacetylase; Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor; in vivo; Injury; insight; Ischemia; Light; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; Mediation; Membrane Potentials; MicroRNAs; Mitochondria; mitochondrial dysfunction; Molecular; Molecular Target; mouse model; MS-275; Mus; Neuroglia; Neurologic Dysfunctions; neuronal survival; Neurons; Nitric Oxide Synthase; novel; novel therapeutics; Oxidative Stress; Oxygen; Pathogenesis; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase III Clinical Trials; Physiological; Population; prevent; Production; promoter; Protein Acetylation; Protein Isoforms; Recovery; Recovery of Function; Recruitment Activity; Regulation; Regulator Genes; Research; research study; Risk; Role; stroke; stroke therapy; Structure; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Intervention; United States; white matter; white matter injury; ","Vulnerability of Aging White Matter to Ischemia","033720","NOMD","Neural Oxidative Metabolism and Death Study Section ","","","07","250000","146250","396250",""

The results will have important implications for elucidating the basis of cognitive disorders of schizophrenia, shown to have impaired prefrontal function and deficits in working memory.","1891295; ","PASTERNAK, TATIANA ;","FLANDERS, MARTHA C","09/30/2016","04/30/2017","Afferent Neurons; Area; area MT; Attention; base; Behavioral; cell type; Code; Cognition Disorders; Cognitive; cognitive function; Contralateral; Decision Making; Dependence; Discrimination; executive function; feeding; flexibility; fovea centralis; Functional disorder; GABA Agonists; Generations; Goals; Grant; Impaired cognition; Ipsilateral; Link; Location; Maintenance; Measures; Mediating; Memory; Mental disorders; Monkeys; Motion; Muscimol; Nature; Neurons; Performance; Physiology; Play; Prefrontal Cortex; Process; Property; relating to nervous system; Research; response; retinotopic; Role; Sampling; Schizophrenia; Sensory; sensory cortex; Sensory Process; Short-Term Memory; Signal Transduction; Source; Speed; Stimulus; Task Performances; Testing; Time; Visual Fields; Visual Motion; ","CORTICAL SUBSTRATES OF WORKING MEMORY FOR VISUAL MOTION","011749","COG","Cognitive Neuroscience Study Section ","","S2","18","11166","5974","17140",""

The layer underneath called the dermis cushions the body from stress and strain. In individuals with healthy skin, there are protein anchors between these two layers that prevent them from moving independently from one another (shearing). In people born with Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB), a rare genetic connective tissue disorder, the two skin layers lack the protein anchors that hold them together, resulting in extremely fragile skin. Because the skin is so fragile, even a minor injury (like rubbing or pressure) will separate the layers of the skin and form blisters and painful sores. Infection and non-healing wounds are serious problems for EB. EB commonly causes blister and lesion formation on the skin but it can also affect the mouth, esophagus, lungs, muscles, eyes, nails and teeth. There are three main types of inherited EB (Simplex, Dystrophic, and Junctional) and, based on the type, the symptoms can range from mild to disabling or life threatening. People diagnosed with the mild form of the disease lead a painful life with blisters mainly on the hands and feet, but their disease is not typically disfiguring or lethal. In more severe forms, there is generalized blistering of the skin, and the skin appears to be peeled off. The fingers may fuse and hands contract, reducing movement. Chronic damage from the condition often leads to development of skin cancer, which typically develops with patients in their 20's or 30's and can be lethal. There is currently no cure or effective treatment for EB. Treatment is largely prophylactic, and involves protecting the skin from damage, relieving itching that occurs with healing of the wounds, applying protective bandaging with use of barrier creams like Vaseline or Aquaphor to prevent adhering of the bandages to the skin and preventing infection, controlling pain with medications, and using antibiotics to control infections. Management of the disease is extremely difficult for both patients and their families and involves a lifelong commitment by the family members.Scioderm, INC. is developing SD-101 dermal cream (formulation containing allantoin) for the treatment of EB. In this grant Scioderm is proposing a clinical program for the use of SD-101 to demonstrate healing of chronic wounds and lesional skin associated with patients with EB. Secondarily, SD-101 will also be used for reduction of skin blistering and erosions associated with EB, by facilitating healing of skin lesions and reducing the incidence and/ or severity of new lesions. We expect SD-101 will be safe and effective as p reliminary clinical investigations have shown fast and complete healing of wounds in EB patients. In addition, SD-101 was found safe to date in clinical trials performed in both healthy volunteers and EB patients. EB is acknowledged as a rare disease by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and to further develop the product and to make the cream available to EB patients, Allantoin has been designated as an orphan product (designation 01-1510). SD-101 has also received breakthrough therapy (BT) designation by the FDA for the treatment of patients with inherited EB, which may enable expedited development and approval of SD-101 for EB patients. In addition, the Dermatology division of FDA has agreed to waive the majority of the long-term toxicology studies, including carcinogenicity and reproductive studies. Agreement with the division was also reached regarding the study design for the single pivotal study, including the definition of the primary endpoint.This grant will be used to assist in the completion of the pivotal clinical program necessary for approval of SD-101 for the treatment of skin effects across the various types of EB.","1935679; ","BARTH, JAY A;","","09/30/2016","08/31/2017","","SD-101 Cream to Treat Epidermolysis Bullosa Phase 3 IND107480 12/20/12","005095","ZFD1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","01","","","500000",""

In an effort to improve longitudinal care coordination and restrain rising costs, Medicare is testing accountable care organizations (ACOs). The impact of ACOs on both Medicare spending and patient outcomes remains uncertain, however. To the extent that post-acute care spending is reduced, understanding whether lower costs occur through reductions in the quantity or intensity of post-acute care, or both, will be important. Furthermore, ACOs vary widely in their organizational structure and risk models. Thus, identifying whether ACO heterogeneity modifies ACOs' impact on post-acute care will also be important. Finally, there is considerable uncertainty about how any changes in post-acute care utilization will impact key clinical outcomes such as mortality. Therefore, we propose to use national Medicare data to examine the effects of Medicare ACO implementation on post-acute care utilization, spending, and patient outcomes.","10387027; ","CHEN, LENA ;","HELLINGER, FRED ","09/30/2016","07/31/2021","","Effects of accountable care organizations on post-acute care","024698","HSVR","Healthcare Systems and Values Research ","","","01","","","",""

We must learn how to regulate the denucleation process because denucleation is critical, will also allow controlling cell proliferation, and this knowledge would also inform about ways to avoid ?secondary cataracts? that appear after cataract surgery, as well as have major ramifications for cancer and other diseases in which control of cell proliferation is desirable.

More deaths are caused each year by tobacco use than by all deaths from AIDS, illegal drug use, alcohol use, motor vehicle injuries, suicides, and murders combined. Reducing smoking rates among homeless Veterans is a high priority. Unfortunately, smoking cessation treatments are greatly underutilized, particularly among homeless Veteran smokers.

We will begin with a 9-month vanguard phase among 7 centers in the US, Europe, Africa, and South America then add 9 sites in a second wave of recruitment, using multiple complementary methods to maximize participant safety and adherence.","2087177; ","MUKAMAL, KENNETH JAY;","OROSZ, ANDRAS ","09/30/2016","07/31/2021","Accounting; Adherence; adiponectin; Adult; Africa; aged; Aging; Alcohol consumption; alcohol effect; Alcohol Nutrition; alcohol risk; alcohol testing; Alcoholic Beverages; Alcohols; arm; Asia; Beverages; Biological; Cardiovascular Diseases; cardiovascular disorder risk; cardiovascular health; cardiovascular risk factor; Cardiovascular system; Cessation of life; Chronic Disease; Clinical; Clinical Data; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials; Collaborations; Coronary heart disease; design; Diabetes Mellitus; Disease; drinking; Electronics; Enrollment; Ensure; Epidemiologic Studies; Epidemiology; Equilibrium; Europe; Event; experience; Face; feeding; Fibrinogen; flexibility; follow-up; Frequencies; Funding; Health; High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol; high risk; Human; Impaired fasting glycaemia; Individual; instrument; Insulin Resistance; Ischemic Stroke; Laboratories; Life; Link; Measures; Methods; Monitor; mortality; Myocardial Infarction; National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism; novel; Outcome; Participant; Pathway interactions; Patients; Phase; Prevention; Randomized; Randomized Clinical Trials; Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials; randomized trial; Reporting; Research; Research Personnel; response; Risk; Safety; Site; South America; Testing; Time; trial comparing; trial design; United States National Institutes of Health; Work; World Health Organization; ","The Moderate Alcohol and Cardiovascular Health Trial","025286","ZAA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","6469237","362761","6831998",""

Standard glaucoma surgeries are lengthy and traumatic with unpredictable outcomes and complication rates of 20-60%. There has not been a major improvement in both safety and efficacy of glaucoma surgeries for the last 40 years. Camras Vision has developed a prototype shunt which can set and adjust pressure and circumvents the major source of complications present with standard glaucoma surgeries.

Tumor viruses, such as Epstein-Barr  Virus (EBV), have evolved mechanisms to subvert host-cell responses to infection, and to hijack cellular  pathways that govern proliferation and ensure viral survival. We propose that a cellular gene Ubiquitin C-  terminal Hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1), induced by EBV and other tumor viruses, is responsible for redirecting central  systems of internal and external membrane trafficking and processes of cell-cell communications. Using  different experimental systems we will test the hypothesis that the multifunctional molecule UCH-L1  manipulates intra- and intercellular trafficking that ultimately results not only in primary tumor development, but  invasion and metastasis as well. We also propose the first controlled studies to investigate whether the highly  specific small molecule inhibitor against UCH-L1 will prevent or slow genesis of the fatal lymphomas induced  by EBV in vivo in humanized mice.","1881922; ","PAGANO, JOSEPH S;","","05/01/1997","06/30/2021","abstracting; Affect; B-Cell Lymphomas; B-Lymphocytes; base; Binding; Biochemical; Biogenesis; cancer cell; Carcinoma; Cell Communication; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell physiology; cell transformation; Cells; Cellular Structures; Complex; Computer Simulation; Controlled Study; Data; Deubiquitinating Enzyme; Deubiquitination; Development; Disease; Ensure; enzyme activity; Epithelial; Epithelial Cells; Epstein-Barr virus LMP-1 protein; exosome; extracellular; Family; FGF2 gene; Genes; Human; Human Herpesvirus 4; Human Herpesvirus 8; Human Papillomavirus; humanized mouse; Hydrolase; in vivo; Infection; inhibitor/antagonist; interest; Intracellular Membranes; late endosome; Link; Lymphoid Cell; Lymphoma; Lymphomagenesis; Malignant lymphoid neoplasm; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; Membrane; membrane biogenesis; Membrane Microdomains; Membrane Protein Traffic; Membrane Proteins; Mesenchymal; Metastatic Carcinoma; microvesicles; MMP9 gene; Molecular; mouse model; N-Cadherin; Nanotubes; Neoplasm Metastasis; novel; Oncogenes; Oncogenic Viruses; Outcome; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Patients; Physiological; Play; Preclinical Drug Evaluation; prevent; Primary Neoplasm; Process; Production; Property; Proteins; reactivation from latency; response; Role; small molecule inhibitor; Sorting - Cell Movement; Stromal Cells; Stromal Neoplasm; Structure; System; Testing; Tissues; trafficking; Tube; tumor; tumor microenvironment; tumor progression; tumorigenesis; tumorigenic; Ubiquitin; Ubiquitin C; ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors; Vesicle; Viral; ","Project 2 - Membrane trafficking in EBV malignancies:  Implication of deubiquitinase UCH-L1","019014","ZCA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","7901","","37","203169","105606","","308775"

Diabetic macular edema is the leading cause of vision loss in working aged adults in the United States and retinal vein occlusion and uveitis also represent major causes of vision loss. Thus better understanding of the causes and possible treatments for macular edema represents an important public health goal. Current treatments for macular edema include monthly intraocular injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor drugs, corticosteroid treatments or thermal laser directed at the retina. No therapy is universally effective and all have disadvantages including cost and risk of side effects. Importantly, despite current therapies a significant proportion of patients experience persistent macular edema and vision loss in spite of treatment. The studies proposed here will help understand the role of Müller glial cells in retinal edema and may identify new targets for therap for patients who continue to lose vision despite current treatments.","12326592; ","ALLINGHAM, MICHAEL JOHN;","AGARWAL, NEERAJ ","09/30/2016","08/31/2020","Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Adult; Adverse effects; Affect; aged; Animal Model; Area; Automobile Driving; Award; base; Biological Models; Biology; Blindness; Blood; Blood capillaries; Blood Vessels; capillary; career development; Clinical; Clinical Research; cost; Cyst; Data; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; diabetic; Diabetic Retinopathy; Diffuse; Disadvantaged; Disease; Doctor of Medicine; Doctor of Philosophy; Ensure; Environment; Event; experience; Extracellular Fluid; Extravasation; Eye; eye center; Faculty; Failure; Figs - dietary; Functional disorder; Funding; Goals; Health; Hemorrhage; Human; improved; in vivo; Inflammation; Injection of therapeutic agent; Injury; Intracellular Fluid; Ischemia; Lasers; Liquid substance; macula; macular edema; Medical; meetings; Mentors; Mitochondria; mitochondrial dysfunction; Modeling; mouse model; Muller's cell; Mus; Nature; Neurobiology; Neuroglia; new therapeutic target; novel; novel therapeutics; Ophthalmology; Pathogenesis; Pathology; Patients; Peptides; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Potassium; Prevention; Process; programs; Public Health; public health relevance; Publications; Pump; Recovery; Research; responsible research conduct; Retina; retina blood vessel structure; Retinal; Retinal Diseases; Retinal Edemas; Retinal Vein Occlusion; Risk; Role; Scientist; SECTM1 gene; Signal Transduction; Specialist; Structure; Study models; success; Supporting Cell; Swelling; Testing; Tissues; Training; United States; Universities; Uveitis; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors; vein occlusion; Vision; Water; Work; ","Muller glial dysfunction in retinal edema","026627","ZEY1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","147885","11831","159716",""

This study advances the science of sexual assault prevention by evaluating whether these theoretically-similar programs that target change at multiple levels of the social ecology (individual-, peer- and community-level) through different administration approaches impact rates of sexual aggression, dating violence and related risk and protective factors in comparison to a dose-and attention matched control group over a 6-month follow-up.","10236676; ","ORCHOWSKI, LINDSAY MARIE;","","09/30/2014","09/29/2018","","Preventing sexual aggression among high school boys","002531","ZCE1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","03","","","440727",""

INFRASTRUCTURE AND ADMINISTRATION (Index of acronyms in Appendices Table of Contents)  A. Mission, Goals and Priorities. Minnesota is a prime arena for addressing social inequities in health.  Rapidly changing demographic composition has contributed new strengths as well as challenges to our health,  education, and social service systems. MN leads in East African, Latino and SE Asian immigration;  Minneapolis has the second largest urban American Indian population in the US. Our communities of color are  relatively young in terms of percentage of families with children, and particularly in Minneapolis and St. Paul,  health disparities are intermingled with economic distress and social segregation. The stark reality confronting  our communities and our systems of care is the deepening need for partnerships that meld community  experience with scholarship and public health (PH) practice-based knowledge. We believe, in the words of the  Lancet International Advisory Group on Adolescent Health, that '...failure to invest in the second decade of  life, despite the availability of proven and promising prevention and health promotion strategies, will  jeopardize earlier investments in health, substantially erode the quality and length of human life, and escalate  human suffering, inequity, and social instability.'1   The University of Minnesota Healthy Youth Development Prevention Research Center (UMN PRC) is  dedicated to nurturing partnerships that will co-create the fusion of knowing and doing through its core  mission: through collaboration with health departments, related agencies & community partnerships, develop  and disseminate actionable knowledge and practices that promote healthy development & health equity  among all young people, and, in so doing, advance adolescent-focused Healthy People 2020 (HP 2020) goals,  elements of the National Prevention Strategy, and CDC Winnable Battles, particularly reproductive health.   B. Organizational Structure and Linkages. Initially funded by the CDC in 1996 as the National Teen  Pregnancy Prevention Research Center, UMN PRC is embedded in an institutional context highly conducive to  achieving its core mission, goals and objectives, and leveraging complementary resources that expands its  reach and impact. As in Org Charts (App D), UMN PRC is part of an Academic Health Center (AHC) that  includes the Schools of Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, and the UMN's CTSA. UMN PRC faculty/staff are  appointed in these AHC schools along with the College of Education & Human Development. The AHC is  under the direct authority of the UMN President, whose community engagement activities are conducted  under the auspices of the Office of Public Engagement to which UMN PRC members play an ongoing advisory  role. Likewise, the UMN CTSA partners with the PRC to strengthen its own inter-collegiate community  engagement portfolio of applied public health research, training, outreach and advocacy.   UMN PRC is located within the Division of General Pediatrics & Adolescent Health (DOGPAH), with its 35- year history and expertise in adolescent health research and translation, training, TA, community partnerships,  strategic communications, and dissemination of evidence to promote effective programs, policy and public  health practice. At its inception, UMN PRC capitalized on this experience through immediate formation of a  Community Advisory Network, and involvement of community partners, health departments and related  agencies in the crafting of our earliest core research focused on preventing teen pregnancy and sexual risk  behaviors (Prime Time). This early research evolved into school and clinic-based interventions that engaged  community members, educators and PH professionals in youth-development strategies to prevent teen  pregnancy, violence involvement, and school dropout. Our earliest intra- and inter-collegiate linkages with the  Konopka Institute for Best Practices in Adolescent Health (and its State Adolescent Health Resource Center  that provides TA and consultation to the nation's network of State Adolescent Health Coordinators), the  Center for Adolescent Nursing (with its extensive history of adolescent health research and preparation of the  scholarly and practice workforce), and the School of Public Health, nurtured the early development of an  interdisciplinary faculty and staff, linked across academic units, with a shared commitment to prevention  science, community engagement, applied research and its translation into action.   C. Staffing Plan. UMN PRC 2014-2019 will be guided by a Leadership Team comprised of Director Resnick,  Deputy Director Sieving, and Team Leaders: Oliphant (Community), Shea (Communications), Jordan  (Training), Shlafer (Evaluation) and McMorris (Research). The UMN PRC Org Chart (App D) depicts the  Leadership Team that will provide overall direction to the PRC, the interdisciplinary teams for each unit, their  key activities, and reporting lines within the broader context of the Division. We developed this organizational  structure in our initial funding cycle, honed and refined over time, recognizing that a Leadership Team that  includes CAN co-chairs (nominated & elected as per CAN by-laws) is essential to a PRC that is nimble and  responsive to priorities and concerns from health departments and other community partners. The UMN PRC  led the March 2008 PRC national network pre-conference ?Structured for Success? that explicated the PRC  network?s experiences with varying infrastructure arrangements. With the goal of enhancing each PRC's  capacity to increase its own effectiveness through infrastructure modification and improvements, this marked  the 1st time in the history of the network that PRC directors/representatives shared with each other the various  infrastructure arrangements crosscutting the national network.  D. Leveraged Resources and Institutional Commitments. Since its inception, UMN PRC has garnered  approximately $21,000,000 in research and training grants, PRC Special Interest Projects, foundation grants,    contracts and external sales. Documented in Letters of Support and shown in the UMN Org Relationships  Chart, the UMN institutional commitment in this competitive renewal application equals approximately  $365,000, i.e., annual match dollars for each of 5 years of the project period from the Office of the Vice President  for Research ($10,000), the AHC ($20,000), Department of Pediatrics ($20,000), CTSA (15% Training Team  Leader Jordan salary and fringe support, ~$23,000), and the Division of General Pediatrics & Adolescent  Health (office space, administrative, financial and technological support).   E. Qualifications and History of PRC Director. On faculty since 1981, Michael Resnick, PhD, Professor of  Pediatrics, Nursing, and Public Health, holds the Konopka Chair in Adolescent Health & Development. He is  the founding PD/PI (1996) of the UMN PRC. With colleagues, his work has had a transformative impact on  shaping the field of adolescent health in the US and globally. Beginning in the 1980s, under his leadership of  the National Adolescent Health Resource Center (funded by MCHB/HRSA/DHHS), the MN Adolescent  Health Survey and the subsequent American Indian Adolescent Health Survey (the largest survey of American  Indian and Alaskan Native youth ever undertaken at the time) formed the basis for the CDC in creating the  National Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS). Resnick served as a consultant to the CDC as the YRBS was  being developed, which today, is implemented in nearly every state across the country. His federal  congressional testimony on the findings of the Indian Adolescent Health Survey helped propel Congress to  authorize more than $30 million for adolescent mental health for young people on reservations, a 1st in the  history of the Indian Health Service. Resnick was also invited under two presidential administrations to be a  keynote speaker at White House conferences on youth. It is this interweaving of research and the translation of  research to improve the health and well-being of young people that has characterized his career. It is also  because of his growing reputation that in the mid 1990s he was invited to be a Co-PI on the National  Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) where, leading the MN team he had lead responsibility  for crafting the initial adolescent health survey component of that study. That landmark research was released  in 1997 with Resnick as lead author in JAMA. 2 This seminal article has been cited more than nearly any other  publication in the field of adolescent health and led to widespread prominence of the theme that has  epitomized his research: the influence of connectedness on adolescent health and well-being.   Resnick's work has had a profound impact on the field of adolescent health, ranging from our own federal  Office of Adolescent Health to the work of transnational institutions such as the World Health Organization,  the Pan American Health Organization, UNICEF, and more recently, the Lancet International Advisory Group  on Adolescent Health, where we see adoption of the healthy youth development paradigm that flows directly  from Resnick's work. In this area of research and research translation, no measures are more frequently used,  than those developed by Resnick with his interdisciplinary team at UMN. The use of this research on how to  best advance health equity in young people, assuring their ability to enter into rapidly changing social contexts  and a very complex global economy, embodies what Resnick has long defined as a goal of his career: to use  science, translation, dissemination and evidence-based advocacy to assure that we regard adolescents as whole human  beings in the context of family, peers, school and community, not as a simple set of risk indicators. It is his ability to  translate that research that has resulted in global impact. He has been invited to speak at policy and research  forums in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Portugal, Britain, Malaysia, Iceland, Germany, Switzerland, and  Turkey. And because of his international reputation he has attracted fellows and trainees from not only across  the United States but from Spain, Australia, New Zealand, Ghana, China, Barbados, Argentina, Uruguay,  Israel, and Canada, seeking to learn how to conduct research into healthy youth development and to translate  that work to set public health priorities and policies that benefit youth.   Resnick has been PI or Co-I on numerous federal and foundation research grants focusing on health and  risk behaviors, resiliency and protective factors in the lives of young people, with emphasis on issues related to  adolescent sexual behaviors, teen pregnancy, violence and school drop-out. He has been PI on $17.7 million in  external grants (NIH, CDC, MCHB, foundations) and co- PI/co-author on an additional $8.7 million in external  grants (counting awards of >$100,000). He has 177 peer reviewed journal articles, book chapters, reviews, and  monographs, many reflecting his active mentoring of newer faculty, fellows, and staff. He has served as a  consultant/reviewer for WHO, NSF, CDC, NIH, the Society for Adolescent Health & Medicine, the Guttmacher  Institute, the Natl Campaign to Prevent Teen & Unplanned Pregnancy, and several international research  councils. He has received 4 outstanding teaching and research awards. His PRC commitment will be 25%,  supported by a combination of PRC funds and resources from his Endowed Chair and match dollars.   F. Multidisciplinary Faculty and Staff with Demonstrated Experience. The UMN Org Chart shows the  academic appointments and inter-linkages of faculty and staff across the Schools of Medicine, Nursing, and  Public Health, and within our Division (DOGPAH) that create the group comprising UMN PRC. A particular  strength of this team is its intercollegiate, interdisciplinary composition, years of continuity in terms of  working relationships, and extensive experience in partnering with state, county and local health departments,  related agencies, and an array of community partners that share a commitment to nurturing healthy  adolescent development and the promotion of health equity among all young people. A table in Facilities &    Resources lists the PRC members, their areas of expertise and those who hold 1o and 2o appointments in AHC  schools and elsewhere at UMN. Our embeddedness in collaborative networks further flows from a long series  of core, community-partnered PRC projects that link scholarship, practice and dissemination of evidence with  our broader constituents and partners, foremost among them - state and local health departments, schools and  youth-serving agencies. As noted in a table in Facilities & Resources, PRC members are partnered with  national, regional, state and local collaborating organizations in a variety of capacities: research, TA, training,  evaluation, program and policy development, enactment, and diffusion. These relationships provide the basis  for our proposed scope of work, designed to address adolescent-focused national health goals, elements of the  National Prevention Strategy, and the CDC's Winnable Battles.  G. Ongoing-prevention Projects & Activities. UMN PRC members are engaged in a wide array of  prevention/health promotion activities supported by a diverse portfolio of funding that reflects our  interdisciplinary composition and well-established partnerships. These research, training and dissemination  activities will underpin much of UMN PRC's plan for activities over the next 5 years, involving state, county  and local departments of health, related agencies, community organizations and scholarly partners that share a  commitment to healthy youth development, the dual strategy of reducing risk while enhancing protective  factors and capacity in the lives of young people, and enhancing health equity that promotes positive life  trajectories for youth, particular those living in challenging social environments.

COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, PARTNERSHIPS, AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  A. Collaboration with Community Health Departments and Other Stakeholders. UMN PRC has an  extensive history of collaborating with and providing technical assistance (TA) to local, county and state  departments of health. As shown in the Work Plan, these ties will continue as we engage in work that connects  with community and increases the capacity of the PH workforce, i.e., we will capitalize on these relationships  as evidenced through Letters of Support.   Community Advisory Network: Headed by Team Leader Oliphant, UMN PRC will utilize the expertise of  our Community Advisory Network (CAN). Members of CAN are professionals who have broad expertise in  community-based health issues with young people and are employed by PH departments, departments of  education, and community-based non-profits. Half of the current members work in city, county and state  public health departments thereby strengthening the CAN-UMN PRC connection to public health. CAN  advises on various aspects of UMN PRC, including the core research project, community engagement efforts,  PH policies, training priorities, and dissemination strategies. Also, CAN provides invaluable guidance on  accessing youth-serving professionals, such as nurse practitioners and physicians, teachers, and other public  health professionals and will continue to advise on best means for reaching target populations and ensuring  greater reach and impact of Center activities. Past examples of CAN involvement include advising on  dissemination of the state's policy plan for teen pregnancy prevention, development of topics for training in  the Summer Institute, and advising on the core research projects such as assessing the need of out-of-school  youth. Letters of Support detail activities, roles and responsibilities, and partnerships goals for 2014-19.     Led by 2 co-chairs (elected by the whole body of the CAN to serve 2-year terms), the entire CAN meets  quarterly with additional ad hoc meetings as needed; co-chairs also participate in monthly Leadership Team  meetings. Co-chairs and all CAN members fulfill duties as outlined by the UMN PRC's CAN job descriptions,  rules/policies, and community engagement agreement, all created and approved by CAN (App D). A bi- monthly electronic newsletter assures communication with CAN, the Youth Advisory Board (described  below), and local, state and national partners. UMN PRC co-chairs have always actively engaged in the  National Community Committee (NCC), serving as chairs or members of the Oral Health Special Interest  Group, Policies & Procedures, and Fund Development. Oliphant and at least one co-chair have regularly  attended all NCC activities and participate in NCC monthly telephone calls. Oliphant has the trust of CAN  and extensive connections to community members, including UMN PRC's target populations. A founding  member of the now highly organized NCC, Oliphant has led UMN PRC's CAN since its inception.   Youth Advisory Board. UMN PRC will build on its existing Division's Youth Advisory Board (YAB). YAB  currently consists of 8 adolescents and young adults (ages 14-21 yrs) who have been trained on adolescent  health issues, including teaching interviewing skills to health providers. YAB will be expanded to include 3  youth who have been participating as peer educators in our current PRC core Latino teen pregnancy  prevention research project. YAB members are paid on an hourly basis with PRC match funding. Guided by  Oliphant, YAB will follow a Youth-on-Boards training model for its monthly meetings designed to advise on  various UMN PRC activities.  One YAB member elected by YAB will participate in CAN and PRC Leadership  Team meetings. In addition, YAB members will be engaged in community activities, providing TA to health  departments for the development of programming as well as providing training and feedback around  interviewing skills to medical and oral health professionals. Thus, YAB members will serve as technical  experts and teachers to practitioners who need training in best practices for interviewing adolescents on  specific topics related to the HP 2020 goals identified in the Community Engagement Work Plan.   B. Community Support and Engagement. UMN PRC will collaborate and provide TA to several departments  of health and education in its proposed scope of work, to commence in Fall 2014, including:   1. Oral Health and HPV-An Adolescent Health Initiative: The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH)  and UMN PRC will collaborate to develop a best-practice approach for MN dentists and oral health providers  to increase the awareness of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and the link to oropharyngeal cancer (OPC).   MDH's Oral Health Program and UMN PRC will develop a module for interviewing skills for dental health  providers that focuses on HPV, HPV vaccine and adolescent-friendly services, especially in school settings.  This work is an extension of the MDH Oral Health State Plan and the PRC's NCC Oral Health Work Group  with approaches based on CDC's recommendations for approaching high-risk groups for HPV-associated  OPCs and current trends in the incidence of HPV-positive OPCs. YAB members will provide direction on  module development and teach the module to oral healthcare providers. Sparked by conversations with the  Natl Oral Health Alliance, NCC, and MDH, this novel approach of using adolescents to teach oral health  providers is the 1st of its kind. Key stakeholders include the MN Oral Health Program and MDH Center for  Health Promotion. Under the director's leadership, we will have access to the statewide network of dental  providers and entry into annual conferences of oral health providers to teach the new module.   2. Adolescent Health Clinics Standards of Care and MN's DASH HIV Grant: Hennepin County (which  includes Minneapolis) Human Services and Public Health Department efforts to standardize clinical care for  adolescents are a systems-level innovation critical for improved adolescent sexual health outcomes. The  standards align with federal-level initiatives in the Office of Adolescent Health, CDC's Divs. of Reproductive  Health and Adolescent & School Health (DASH) that emphasize the use of standards-based approaches. We  will partner with Hennepin County, MDH and MDE staff funded by CDC DASH and the Natl Network of  State Adolescent Health Coordinators with the State Adolescent Health Resource Center (SAHRC) to  expanded adoption of clinical standards. This partnership will target new Hennepin County clinics, statewide  clinics in school districts targeted through the DASH grant, and nationally, clinics in other states, via the  training of State Adolescent Health Coordinators involved in sexual health programs. The partnership will  leverage diffusion of innovation strategies to accomplish this goal: segmenting audiences based on adoption  and thought-leader status, identifying and promoting the relative advantages of adoption, and addressing  compatibility, complexity and trial-ability. These will be promoted via 1) applied communications strategies  and products (UMN PRC and Hennepin County will co-create a tool kit); 2) experiential training facilitated by  the YAB that will offer clinics real-world experience effectively engaging adolescents; and 3) through inter- personal interactions and relationships, likely accomplished through the formation of a national Collaborative  Innovation Network that will allow partners to directly support one another. We regularly partner with  SAHRC to support state PH department collaborations to improve systems approaches to adolescent health.   3. MN Chlamydia Partnership (MCP): MDH identified chlamydia as a leading cause of morbidity in MN.  Seeking an innovative strategy for its prevention and control, the STD Clinical Specialist Infertility Prevention  Project Coordinator (MDH STD and HIV Section) and key stakeholder has requested the UMN PRC to provide  TA on future MCP activities. Specifically, through monthly planning meetings and in-the-field TA, we will     collaborate on models of care and dissemination of best practices for chlamydia control.  These approaches are  grounded in the MN State Plan for Chlamydia Prevention developed in a current partnership between MDH and  UMN PRC. We will work collaboratively both locally and in greater Minnesota to provide county and local  public health as well as community-based health non-profits on non-traditional approaches to the prevention  and control of this sexually transmitted disease as outlined in the MN State Plan.  4. Minneapolis Urban Initiative for Reproductive Health: UMN PRC and the Minneapolis Urban Initiative  for Reproductive Health under the guidance of key stakeholder, Minneapolis Health Department, will  collaborate on development of an innovative model to provide sexual health education to students along with  their teachers and coaches in this large urban school district. We will provide TA on implementation of  evidence-based sexual health curricula in all 6-8th grade classrooms in the district, as well as in the district's  charter and alternative schools. UMN PRC will also provide leadership in development of a program designed  to assist coaches in preventing sexual bullying within school sports teams and among team members.   5. Minneapolis Blueprint for Youth Violence Prevention: Minneapolis and its health department are  widely-recognized for ground-breaking work in implementing a comprehensive, multi-sectorial plan to  prevent youth violence: Blueprint for Action: Preventing Youth Violence. As one of a select group of cities invited  to join the Urban Networks to Increase Thriving Youth (UNITY) through a CDC-funded cooperative  agreement, Minneapolis promotes collaboration across public and private sectors and adoption of a  comprehensive approaches to violence prevention. True to a PH model, the Blueprint lays out 1o, 2o, and 3o  prevention goals along with 34 action steps to reduce and prevent youth violence. An executive committee  including PRC, government, nonprofit, business and youth representation provides oversight.  6. It's That Easy: It's That Easy (ITE) offers parent educators with the training and tools needed to empower  parents to connect with their children, share family values, and engage in conversations about sexuality and  relationships. ITE is a train-the-trainer model for youth-serving organizations and health/education  departments in urban and rural areas as well as culturally-specific groups, e.g., tribal nations. Co-sponsors are  MDH, MDE, and TeenWise MN, a statewide non-profit for teen pregnancy prevention. We will assist in  expanding an ITE dissemination plan and serve as content experts to curriculum and website development.  7. Diffusion of Innovation with State Adolescent Health Resource Center (SAHRC): Given our co- location with SAHRC, we are uniquely poised to promote innovative models of partnership with local and  state health departments reaching national audiences. SAHRC (described in Letter of Support) provides TA to  the nation?s adolescent health staff in state health departments and serves as facilitator for the National  Network of State Adolescent Health Coordinators - the membership organization for all state adolescent  health coordinators. Recognizing that many UMN PRC community-based projects align well with work  underway in other states, UMN PRC will partner with SAHRC to 1) disseminate relevant, highly applied  evidence; 2) frame information for adoption of innovation by highlighting advantages and compatibility with  existing values and practices; 3) facilitate adoption by engaging adolescent health coordinator networks,  identifying an avant-garde of early adopters, and providing them with strategic TA for piloting of innovations.  III. COMMUNICATION AND DISSEMINATION  A. Infrastructure for Communication and Dissemination. UMN PRC offers an infrastructure of resources and  personnel to support communication and dissemination activities with the expertise and capacity to translate  research findings and evidence-based practices to various audiences while aligning with diffusion of  innovation practices. Since its inception in 1996, UMN PRC has prioritized communications/dissemination -  most notably by Resnick, UMN PRC Director (in conjunction with former Division Director, R. Blum), whose  dissemination vision included landmark analyses of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health  and translation of these research findings into a monograph series (supported by the Robert Wood Johnson  Foundation) for specific audience segments (education, health care, parent/family support professionals) as  well as for general public audiences. Dissemination strategies also included partnership with a recognized PR  firm (Burness Communications) that resulted in legislative and national press briefings. Resnick has elevated  this priority by hiring Shea, Communications Team Leader, a marketing and communications professional  with >20 years of communications experience in both hi-tech advertising executive and community/academic  settings. Shea directs all PRC communications activities, sets strategy, framing and messaging direction, writes  copy and handles graphic design assignments. Shea's expertise is sought by local, state, and national partners  and she is frequently asked to consult with adolescent health professionals and organizations. Shea also is  recognized locally for her work on state sexual health plans targeting policy and systems changes including A  Work in Progress: Building a Minnesota State Plan for Teen Pregnancy Prevention and Parenting (2003) and  Recommendations for Action from the UMN Chlamydia Partnership - A Special Report (2012).   Shea and Resnick's work is conducted in collaboration with and informed by UMN PRC members and  community partners (examples below). External vendors with expertise in graphic design, PR/media relations,  video production and social media strategy/production enhance UMN PRC's communications capacity. Given  the scope of proposed communications objectives, a .6 FTE will be added to current staff FTE.    Communications capacity is also supported by the UMN which offers a wealth of communications related  resources including the AHC and University Relations PR and communications staff, AHC computer technical  support, printing and video production capabilities, website design and content management as well as a host  of collaboration (e.g. the Communicators Forum) and training (social media; web technologies) opportunities.   B. Website. UMN PRC has the capacity, expertise and technical support to further develop and maintain a  UMN PRC website. The web infrastructure is supported through the AHC which provides consultants and an  easy-to-use content management system, enabling the PRC to maintain the site locally. UMN has recently  migrated to a suite of Google-powered communication and collaboration tools and, through search engine  optimization, delivers highly ranked Google search results.   C. Communications Plan. UMN PRC will develop a center-wide communications plan, including 5-year goals,  objectives, and activities, that integrates communication activities into research, training, evaluation, and  community activities. In the past PRC funding cycle, we created communications plans for partner  organizations: Hennepin County, the UMN Chlamydia Partnership, Public Health departments in Kandiyohi  County and the city of Worthington and Iowa's Youth Development Initiative.   The formal UMN PRC Communications plan will be developed in collaboration with PRC center and core  research project faculty and staff, CAN, community partners, local and national public health departments as  well as advisors fro...","1915141; ","SIEVING, RENEE E;","","09/30/2014","09/29/2019","","Healthy Youth Development Prevention Research Center","005022","ZDP1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","03","","","1059000",""

Symptoms of these problems do not respond effectively to available medications, and there are no approaches to slowing or preventing their development. A major limitation to discovery of new treatment approaches is the underlying complexity of brain pathology in PD with dementia subjects. Individual patients may have various combinations of abnormal protein depositions, including proteins called alpha-synuclein, beta-amyloid, and tau. These proteins are potentially hallmarks of differing pathways and types of brain injury, and are unlikely all to respond to the same type of treatment intervention. Thus, progress in the field of PD with dementia will require methods to identify involved pathways and protein depositions in individual patients. In the present research proposal, we will apply recently-developed research brain imaging methods that can reveal the major degenerating pathways and protein accumulations in PD with dementia. We will evaluate whether this approach results in differing types of symptoms or of symptom progression in individual patients, depending on their imaging results. Ultimately, we expect this brain imaging approach will permit the future design and testing of new specifically-targeted treatments to slow or halt the development of dementia in PD patients.","1862775; ","FREY, KIRK A.;","BABCOCK, DEBRA J.","09/25/2016","05/31/2021","Affect; alpha synuclein; Alzheimer's Disease; Amyloid; Amyloid beta-Protein; Amyloid deposition; amyloid peptide; Attentional deficit; Autopsy; base; Binding; Biological Markers; Brain; Brain imaging; Brain Injuries; Brain Pathology; Cells; Characteristics; Classification; Clinical; clinical Diagnosis; Cognitive; cognitive change; Cognitive deficits; Corpus striatum structure; Dementia; Deposition; design; Deterioration; Development; Diagnosis; dihydrotetrabenazine; disability; Disease; dopaminergic neuron; effective therapy; endophenotype; Exhibits; extracellular; Failure; Figs - dietary; follow-up; Frequencies; Future; Goals; Image; imaging biomarker; imaging modality; Impaired cognition; Individual; individual patient; Intervention; Label; Lead; Lewy Bodies; Lewy Body Dementia; Memory; Memory impairment; mental function; Methods; Modification; Molecular; molecular imaging; Movement Disorders; Natural History; neocortical; Nerve Degeneration; Neurites; Neurofibrillary Tangles; Neurons; neuropathology; novel therapeutic intervention; paired helical filament; Parkinson Disease; Parkinson's Dementia; Parkinsonian Disorders; Pathologic; Pathology; Pathway interactions; patient subsets; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phenotype; Pittsburgh Compound-B; Positron-Emission Tomography; Presynaptic Terminals; prevent; protein aggregate; Proteins; Recruitment Activity; Research; Research Proposals; Senile Plaques; Severities; Source; Stratification; Symptoms; Syndrome; synucleinopathy; tau aggregation; tau Proteins; Testing; Therapeutic Trials; Tracer; trait; ","Lewy Body Dementia Biomarkers","100611","ZNS1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","623303","340106","963409",""

These Veterans are among the 623,000 Americans who live with lower limb amputation and learn to walk with a prosthetic limb, but tend to have hypertension, reduced aerobic capacity, and are less active than those in the general population [2-7]. The Levinson report [8] revealed a controversial increase in the cost of their prostheses with little evidence of improved outcomes. While many believe the expensive technology in next generation limbs [9] will result in greater activity levels that may address ther health disparities, what if there is another, less expensive way? The clinical significance of the proposed research is to determine if evidence supporting the use of inexpensive, smart activity monitors extends to the Veteran lower limb amputee population and to discover if social networks can provide additional motivation to achieve their mobility goals.","8528166; ","KLUTE, GLENN ;","","10/01/2014","09/30/2017","abstracting; Accelerometer; Achievement; Address; Aerobic; Age; Aging; American; Amputees; Award; Awareness; base; Benchmarking; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cellular Phone; clinically significant; Clip; cloud based; cohort; combat; Communities; Computers; cost; Data; Devices; Diabetes Mellitus; diabetic; Eating; Educational process of instructing; Electronic Mail; Feedback; fitness; General Population; Goals; Habits; Happiness; Health; Health Benefit; health disparity; Health Personnel; Hypertension; improved; improved outcome; improving mobility; Individual; Injury; Insurance; interest; Internet; Intervention; Knee; Knowledge; Lead; Learning; Life; Life Style; limb amputation; Limb Prosthesis; Limb structure; Lower Extremity; Monitor; Motivation; next generation; Obesity; Operative Surgical Procedures; Participant; patient population; peer; Peer Group; Performance; Peripheral Vascular Diseases; Persons; Physical activity; Population; population health; Prosthesis; public health relevance; Randomized; Recording of previous events; Reporting; Research; Risk; Sampling; Services; Sleep; social; Social Network; Social status; Stereotyping; Target Populations; Technology; technology validation; Time; Travel; Veterans; Vietnam; Walking; Weight; Wrist; ","Social Activity Networks and the Mobility of Lower Limb Amputees","001603","RRDS","Rehabilitation Research and Development SPiRE Program ","","","03","","","",""

We propose to use our recently developed innovative imaging technique of lung morphometry with hyperpolarized 3He gas MRI to study the structure of the smallest but vitally important lung airways (i.e., alveolar ducts and sacs) that serve as the major gas exchanging units of the lung. The resulting information, never before available from in vivo studies, will allow us to establish quantitative metrics that define the relationships between structural alterations in acinar airways and declines in lung function associated with aging, smoking, and disease. We aim to provide a new approach for assessing the effects of aging and COPD on lung structure, and to develop new and earlier identified targets for prevention and treatment strategies of the major public health problem of COPD.","6618000 (contact); 1857473; ","YABLONSKIY, DMITRIY A (contact); YUSEN, ROGER D;","ROSSI, WINIFRED K.","09/30/2016","08/31/2017","Acceleration; Adult; Affect; Age; age effect; age related; aged; Aging; Air; Alveolar; Alveolar Duct; Alveolar sac; Alveolar wall; Alveolus; base; Blood capillaries; capillary; Cause of Death; Cessation of life; Chest; Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease; cigarette smoking; Collection; Data; Deterioration; Development; Diffusion; Disease; disease phenotype; Distal; Environment; Event; experience; Gases; Generations; Genetic; Goals; Gold; Heterogeneity; Human; Imagery; Imaging Techniques; in vivo; Individual; innovation; Laboratories; Lung; lung volume; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Measurement; Measures; Medical History; morphometry; multimodality; never smoker; novel; novel strategies; Oxygen; Participant; Pathology; Physiology; Prevalence; prevent; Prevention strategy; Process; Public Health; public health relevance; Pulmonary Emphysema; pulmonary function; Quality of life; Respiratory physiology; Role; Rupture; Sampling; Severities; Severity of illness; small airways disease; Smoker; Smoking; Spatial Distribution; Specimen; Structure; Structure of parenchyma of lung; Symptoms; Techniques; Testing; Tissues; tool; treatment strategy; Trees; Walking; X-Ray Computed Tomography; ","In vivo human lung morphometry with hyperpolarized 3He MRI and CT: effects of aging, smoking, and COPD","052582","MEDI","Medical Imaging Study Section ","","","01","462786","242963","705749",""

If it is found, over the course of multiple investigations, that behavioral pharmacotherapeutic strategies are broadly applicable (e.g., not only for insomnia but for other disease states), this will almost certainly change how maintenance therapy is conducted. While 'prn' use of medication will always be an ideal strategy for managing chronic disease that is episodic, the management of unremitting chronic illness requires a different strategy - one that minimizes habituation effects, obviates the need for dose escalation, reduces the risk of dependence, diminishes the incidence of side effects and adverse events, and (if possible) provides a means towards curtailing treatment costs.

Core D will accomplish three goals that are necessary to for the successful completion of this  research. First, we will use sophisticated, FDA-compliant cell processing techniques to isolate NK cells and  stem cells for clinical trials. Second, we will collect patient blood before and after the clinical trials and use  state of the art techniques to measure not only NK cell numbers, but also NK functional status. Patient blood  cells will also be cryopreserved and distributed to investigators on Projects 1 and 2 for additional research  studies. Lastly, we will oversee the creation of clinical-grade drugs (small molecules) that will be tested for their  ability to redirect NK cells to leukemia cells in patients with chemotherapy refractory myeloid malignancies  (leukemia and their pre-leukemic syndromes).","2087503; ","VERNERIS, MICHAEL R.;","","12/01/2004","03/31/2021","Bacteria; Bioinformatics; Biological; Biometry; Biostatistics Core; Blood; Blood Cells; cancer therapy; Cataloging; Catalogs; cell bank; Cell Count; Cell physiology; Cell Therapy; Cells; chemotherapy; Clinical; Clinical Trials; Collaborations; cost; cost effective; Data; data management; DNA Library; Effectiveness; Ensure; functional status; Goals; good laboratory practice; Housing; Human Resources; Immune; Immunologic Monitoring; Immunophenotyping; In Vitro; in vivo; Investigational Therapies; Laboratory Finding; Laboratory Study; leukemia; Link; Measures; meetings; Methods; Monitor; Myeloproliferative disease; Natural Killer Cells; NK Cell Activation; novel; Outcome; Patients; Peripheral Blood Stem Cell; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Process; Production; Program Research Project Grants; receptor; Refractory; Research; Research Personnel; Research Project Grants; research study; Research Support; Resources; Running; sample collection; Sampling; Services; Shipping; Ships; small molecule; Stem cells; success; Syndrome; Techniques; Testing; Transplantation; Work; ","Immune Monitoring and BiKE Production Core","111412","ZCA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","8209","A1","11","87212","35066","","122278"

Research has shown that 29% of nursing home residents might be able to live safely in the community instead. Currently, VA provides nursing home care to more than 13,000 Veterans across the country, which costs about $3.3 billion a year. It is expensive for VA to provide nursing home care to these inappropriate residents and they are using limited resources that could be given to another Veteran with more urgent needs.

As successful malaria control measures have been implemented, transmission in some regions has declined, resulting in a decrease in parasite diversity and the emergence and persistence of specific parasite genotypes in multiple individuals in the population. Using genetic and genomic techniques and a translational systems biology approach, we will determine whether the persistence of specific parasite genotypes is related to neutralizing genotype-specific immunity, enhanced transmission potential, or undiscovered asymptomatic reservoirs, ultimately allowing the development of targeted genotype-transcendent interventions.","9563291; ","BEI, AMY KRISTINE;","SINA, BARBARA J","09/28/2016","08/31/2021","5 year old; abstracting; Affect; Africa; Africa South of the Sahara; Age-Years; analytical tool; Anopheles Genus; Anti-malarial drug resistance; Antibody Response; Antigenic Diversity; Antigenic Variation; Antigens; attributable mortality; B-Lymphocyte Epitopes; base; Biological Assay; Biology; career; Cause of Death; Cells; Child; Clinical; cohesion; cohort; Cohort Studies; Collaborations; Communities; Complex; Country; Culicidae; Data; Department chair; Development; Disease Outbreaks; Drug resistance; Endemic Diseases; Epidemiology; Epitopes; Erythrocytes; Evolution; experience; Exposure to; Family; feeding; Female; Flow Cytometry; Frequencies; Genes; Genetic; Genomic approach; Genomics; Genotype; Goals; Growth; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Hospitals; Human; Immune; immune resistance; Immune response; Immune system; Immunity; Immunoglobulin G; Immunoglobulins; Immunology; In Vitro; Individual; Infection; Infectious Disease Immunology; Infectious Diseases Research; innovation; Institutes; Institution; International; Intervention; Knowledge; Laboratories; Ligands; Light; Malaria; Malaria Vaccines; male; Measures; member; Membrane; Mentors; Mentorship; Molecular; Molecular Genetics; Monitor; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease; Parasites; Parasitology; Pathogenesis; Patients; Plasmodium falciparum; Play; Population; Population Genetics; Positioning Attribute; Prevalence; Process; programs; Public Health; Public Health Schools; Research; Research Activity; Research Personnel; Resources; Role; Scientist; Seasons; Senegal; Staging; Surface Antigens; Systems Biology; Techniques; Technology; Testing; The science of Mycology; Time; tool; Training; Training Activity; Transcript; transcriptomics; transmission process; Tropical Disease; United States; United States National Institutes of Health; Universities; Vaccines; Variant; Variation (Genetics); vector mosquito; vector transmission; Virulence; Work; ","Employing genetic and genomic surveillance to reveal mechanisms of malaria parasite persistence","010496","ICP1","International and Cooperative Projects - 1 Study Section ","","","01","123675","9894","133569",""

Among those with functionally-complete SCI, there is a 100-fold increase in fracture risk. Although bisphosphonates are currently used to in an attempt protect bone in SCI patients, recent studies show that these drugs are ineffective in the SCI population. Thus new strategies for protecting bone mass after SCI are urgently needed. Our study will test, in a rat model 1) whether loss of blood supply to the bone is a cause of bone loss following SCI and 2) whether multi-modal therapy (administration of the vascular protective agent tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) and/or passive motorized bicycle training) can prevent loss of loss of blood flow and loss of bone mineral after SCI. This preclinical study has translational value because it will test a strategy that can be later applied in a clinical trial for prevention of bone loss in Veterans with SCI.","1936129; ","BORST, STEPHEN E.;","","10/01/2016","09/30/2018","Address; Animal Model; Animals; Bicycling; bisphosphonate; Blood; Blood flow; Blood Vessels; bone; Bone Density; bone loss; bone mass; Clinical Trials; Conscious; Contusions; Data; Development; Distal; Endothelium; Exercise; femoral artery; Femur; Fluorochrome; Food; Food Additives; Fracture; Glucocorticoids; Hemorrhage; Herb; Human; improved; in vivo; Injury; innovation; Ischemia; Life; limb bone; Limb structure; Locomotor Recovery; male; Measures; Mechanical Stimulation; Mechanics; microCT; Microspheres; Minerals; Modeling; Morphology; Motor; mouse model; Mus; Musculoskeletal; novel therapeutics; Osteoblasts; Osteoclasts; Osteogenesis; Osteoporosis; Osteoporotic; Paralysed; Patients; PECAM1 gene; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Play; Population; Postmenopausal Osteoporosis; pre-clinical; preclinical study; prevent; Prevention; Protective Agents; Rattus; Reporting; research study; Risk; Rodent; Rodent Model; Role; sham surgery; skeletal; Spinal cord injury; Spinal cord injury patients; Sprague-Dawley Rats; Staining method; Stains; Surface; Testing; Time; Training; Vascular blood supply; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors; Veterans; Work; Yarrow; ","Role Of Bone Blood Flow In Bone Loss Following SCI","002185","RRDS","Rehabilitation Research and Development SPiRE Program ","","A1","01","","","",""

With access to appropriate medical care already scarce in rural areas of healthcare professional shortage, preparing primary care providers to identify and treat patients misusing or abusing opioids becomes an important strategy in curbing the opioid epidemic and saving lives. This project proposes an implementation demonstration to support primary care providers in rural Oklahoma in adopting medication-assisted treatment as an evidence-based strategy for treating persons with opioid use disorder to expand access to care and address potential barriers to achieving the full promise of MAT in office-based settings.","14397412; ","HEIL, SUSAN KAY ROMOSER;","MULLICAN, CHARLOTTE ","09/30/2016","09/29/2019","","MAT Expansion in Rural Oklahoma","025067","ZHS1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","","","",""

Unfortunately, current options of pain medications or invasive interventional procedures are often ineffective in alleviating their pain, and sometimes the invasive nature of these interventions can further exacerbate their pre-existing pain condition. Therefore, there is a need in the field of pain management in developing means of non-invasive and non-pharmacological therapy(ies) in treating PTP-NP. The pain service at the VA San Diego Healthcare System has recently adopted the use of transcutaneous magnetic stimulation (tMS) in treating PTP-NP and noticed encouraging pain relief benefit in patients with PTP-NP.

The medial amygdala, a subdivision of the amygdala, is an important modulator of aggression, driving anger escalations towards violence that recurs in patients suffering from psychiatric disease. The medial amygdala has been found to regulate aggression in a cell type and stimulation intensity dependent manner, however the precise underlying mechanism remains unclear.

However, the same population is also affected by Age?related Macular Degeneration (AMD), with its devastating effect on vision. The anti-inflammatory and antiplatelet properties of aspirin can potentially influence the course of AMD, either by reducing low-grade inflammation in the AMD-related retinal deposits at its earlier stages, or provoking retinal haemorrhaging at more advanced stages. In a placebo-controlled clinical trial of over 5000 Australians followed up for 5 years, the risks and benefits of long-term low-dose aspirin intakes will be determined. The completion of this study may significantly advance current knowledge and provide definitive information on the effect of aspirin: a potential primary prevention treatment, a drug with potential risk for aggravating process at the late AMD stages, none or both.","14080058; 8648307 (contact); ","GUYMER, ROBYN ; MCNEIL, JOHN JAMES (contact);","REDFORD, MARYANN ","09/30/2016","08/31/2021","adjudicate; Affect; Age; age group; Age related macular degeneration; aged; Ancillary Study; Anti-inflammatory; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; arm; Aspirin; Atrophic; Australia; base; Benefits and Risks; Cardiovascular system; Clinical Trials; clinically significant; cohort; Collection; Color; Communities; Complement; Controlled Clinical Trials; cost effectiveness; Data; Data Analyses; Deposition; design; Development; dietary supplements; digital; disability; Disease; Disease Progression; Dose; Dropout; Elderly; empowered; Equipment; Event; experience; Eye; eye center; follow-up; Follow-Up Studies; Funding; Health; Hemorrhage; human disease; Image; Incidence; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Institution; Insurance Carriers; Intake; Intervention; Knowledge; Length; Life; macula; Medical Research; Medicare; metropolitan; Mission; Outcome; Parents; Participant; Pathogenesis; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Photography; Placebo Control; Placebos; Population; prevent; Prevention; Prevention trial; Preventive Medicine; Primary Prevention; Process; Property; Randomized; Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials; Randomized Controlled Trials; Recommendation; Research; Research Infrastructure; Research Priority; Resolution; Resources; Retina; Retinal; Retinal Hemorrhage; Risk; Risk Factors; Role; rural area; Rural Community; Sample Size; Staging; Time; Training; United States National Institutes of Health; Universities; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors; Vision; Visual; Visual impairment; ","Randomized controlled trial of the effect of low dose aspirin on the course of age-related macular degeneration","026890","ZEY1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","304184","24335","328519",""

Advanced prostheses that nearly match the mechanical performance of natural human arms are beginning to emerge from federal research projects and from commercial manufacturers, but the way that users control these prostheses is still too awkward and unreliable. This project will develop a new approach that will allow amputees to control their prostheses in essentially the same way they would control their natural arm. This new system will be surgically implanted, so nothing other than the prosthesis will have to be put on during use, and the quality of control it provides will always be the same.

Data from large clinical trials demonstrate that lowering intraocular pressure in people with glaucoma (whether elevated or not) is neuroprotective; effectively slowing or stopping vision loss. Unfortunately, current medical therapies do not lower intraocular pressure sufficiently in most people, likely because they do not target the conventional outflow pathway that is diseased and causes pressure elevation in glaucoma. The present project extends our investigation of a pressure-sensitive feedback loop involving nitric oxide that regulates outflow resistance through the conventional pathway, which is the chief determinant of intraocular pressure. The proposed studies are geared towards identifying and testing therapies for targeted delivery of nitric oxide within the conventional outflow pathway to more successfully lower intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients.","8255092; 6807329 (contact); ","OVERBY, DARRYL R; STAMER, W DANIEL (contact);","LIBERMAN, ELLEN S","04/01/2012","07/31/2021","Affect; Anterior; base; Benchmarking; Blindness; blood pressure regulation; Blood Vessels; Bypass; Caliber; Cells; Ciliary Muscle; Clinical Trials; Data; design; Development; Devices; Distal; Drainage procedure; Endothelial Cells; Endothelium; Etiology; Exhibits; Feedback; Figs - dietary; Free Radicals; Funding; Generations; genetic linkage; Glaucoma; glaucoma surgery; Goals; Heme; Homeostasis; Human; Individual; inhibitor/antagonist; Intervention; Investigation; Knowledge; Location; Mediating; Medical; minimally invasive; Molecular; new technology; Nitric Oxide; Nitric Oxide Donors; NOS3 gene; novel; Ocular Hypertension; Outcome Study; Pathway interactions; Patients; Perfusion; Permeability; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Physiologic Intraocular Pressure; Physiologic pulse; Physiological; pressure; Primary Open Angle Glaucoma; Production; Regulation; Relaxation; research study; Resistance; response; Role; shear stress; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Smooth Muscle Myocytes; Stents; Structure of sinus venosus of sclera; success; targeted delivery; Testing; Therapeutic; therapeutic target; Tissues; Topical application; Trabecular meshwork structure; Variant; Vascular Endothelium; Vasodilation; Vasodilator Agents; Venous; Venous Pressure level; ","eNOS-Dependent Mechanoregulation of Intraocular Pressure","022359","DPVS","Diseases and Pathophysiology of the Visual System Study Section ","","","05","326595","106126","432721",""

During mitosis, BubR1 delays the onset of anaphase until each chromosome is properly aligned at the metaphase plate for proper attached to bipolar spindles, and loss of BubR1 therefore leads to aneuploidy and an increased incidence of cancer. Interestingly, recent studies have also shed light on a role for BubR1 in regulating the aging process by controlling cellular senescence. Age is one of the greatest risk factors for cancer, and results from the proposed studies will provide a greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving the interrelationship between aging and cancer, thereby providing impetus for more specific therapeutic targets for age-related diseases such as cancer.","8504516; ","NORTH, BRIAN J;","VELAZQUEZ, JOSE M.","09/30/2016","04/30/2021","abstracting; Acetylation; Address; Age; age related; aged; Aging; Aging-Related Process; Anaphase; Aneuploidy; Animals; Automobile Driving; base; Birth; Caloric Restriction; cancer therapy; Cell Aging; Cells; Chromosome Segregation; Chromosomes; Deacetylase; Deacetylation; Development; Disease; Engineering; Ensure; Exhibits; Genetic Materials; genome integrity; Goals; Human; In Vitro; in vivo; Incidence; Individual; Light; Link; Longevity; Malignant Neoplasms; Mammals; Mediating; Metaphase Plate; Mitosis; Mitotic; Modification; Molecular; mouse model; Mus; Mutation; overexpression; Pathway interactions; Phenotype; Phosphorylation; Physiological; Play; pleiotropism; Post-Translational Protein Processing; Predisposition; Premature aging syndrome; prevent; Process; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; Proteins; Regulation; Risk Factors; Rodent Model; Role; segregation; senescence; Signal Pathway; Therapeutic; therapeutic target; Tissues; tumor; Tumor Suppressor Proteins; tumorigenesis; Ubiquitination; ","Mechanisms Controlling BubR1 Regulation of Cancer and Aging","052627","NIA","Neuroscience of Aging Review Committee ","","A1","01","114725","9178","123903",""

One study even found that Veterans were more open to participating in couples/family therapy than in individual psychotherapy. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) created a new policy that encourages mental health care providers to involve Veterans' families in their mental health care, indicating the VA's commitment to family services. While research on Veterans' families is a rapidly growing field, no studies to date have compared the partnerships of female-Veteran couples to those of male-Veteran couples. Yet such comparisons may be essential, as research in the general population suggests that processes within partnership impact women's and men's mental health in different ways. Identifying gender differences in how Veterans' partnerships affect their mental health can inform more effective care, as providers can capitalize on gender differences to inform their assessment and treatment of male- and female-Veteran couples.  ","10865787; ","LAWS, HOLLY BETH;","","10/01/2016","09/30/2018","Address; Affect; Area; Attention; Behavior; career; Caring; Cereals; Characteristics; Clinical; cohort; combat; Conflict (Psychology); coping; Couples; Data Analyses; Development; Disclosure; Distress; Divorce; Eligibility Determination; Emotional; emotional disclosure; Evaluation; expectation; experience; Family; Family member; Family psychotherapy; Family Relationship; Family Research; Female; Freedom; Gender; gender difference; General Population; Goals; health care service utilization; Health Personnel; health related quality of life; Healthcare; Holly; improved; Individual; Intervention; intimate partner violence; K-Series Research Career Programs; Laws; Life; Link; male; Marriage; Measurement; Measures; meetings; men; Mental Depression; Mental Health; Mentors; Mentorship; Meta-Analysis; Military Personnel; novel; operation; Outcome; Patient Self-Report; Pattern; Personal Satisfaction; Persons; Policies; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders; Process; Provider; psychosocial; Psychotherapy; Publishing; Recovery; Reporting; Research; Research Design; Research Personnel; Resources; screening; Self Disclosure; Services; social; Social support; Spouses; symptomatology; Symptoms; Time; tool; Training; Training Activity; Trauma; treatment adherence; Treatment outcome; Veterans; Woman; Work; ","Gender Differences in OEF/OIF Veterans?

There are two phases to this study, retrospective and prospective. The retrospective phase identifies the CJD infected blood donors and the recipients of those blood components while the prospective phase that tracks these recipients for the development of CJD. During the retrospective phase, we receive reports about blood donors who subsequently developed CJD from blood centers, family members, physicians and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Once we receive the report we notify the blood center (if previously not notified) and they contact the consignees of the blood components, the consignees identify the recipients and report the survival status and if deceased the date and cause of death of that recipient. If the recipient is listed as deceased, we verify the date and cause of death with the National Death Index (NDI). If the recipient is listed as alive we move onto the prospective phase of the study. This consists of tracking the recipient to see if they are currently alive (as of the last available NDI data set) and if not, document the date and cause of death. We track the recipients by using the NDI Plus database and other databases as needed. We match the recipient's information to the information in the database to determine if it is a match. The risk to the human subjects is minimal. For donors who are reported by the blood centers, only the donor initials are available. For those individuals  whose family members report the case, the family receives an information letter and Consent for Participation and Release of Information form to fill out. Investigation does not proceed unless the consent for participation is signed. Names of the family reported donors are kept in a secure cabinet with very limited personnel access. Only the donor initials are used when imputing the data in the database. The risk is also minimal for the recipients. The surviving recipients are not  notified of the tracking because to date there has not been a transfusion transmission of classic CJD. Notifying the recipient would cause undue stress and mental anguish. This would be an unnecessary harm to the recipient. All recipient information is kept in a secure cabinet with very limited personnel access. The name, date of birth and Social Security number of the recipients are reported in the database and the database can only be accessed by specific co- investigators.","12182173; ","STEELE, WHITNEY RANDOLPH;","","09/01/2014","08/31/2019","","Research Study to Assess the Risk of Blood Borne Transmission of Classic Forms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease","000360","ZCK1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","03","","","76000",""

In this latter population many are never able to walk again, because they cannot be successfully fitted with prostheses using the currently available socket suspension technologies. The direct skeletal attachment of prostheses, into the remaining stump bone solves the problems of socket induced skin breakdown, and provides the ability to fit short stump and multiple extremity amputees. 'Bone docking' of prostheses vastly improves patient life styles allowing virtually unlimited daily prosthesis wear and increased endurance. In 2014, a 10 patient FDA Pilot Trial will introduce this technology into the VA system. This proposed study includes molecular means of understanding and preventing early-onset infection.

Numerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of select behavioral interventions in reducing HIV-related risk behaviors among diverse groups, including those suffering from health disparities. Nevertheless, adoption and appropriate implementation of these EBIs (evidence-based behavioral interventions/programs) remain challenging to frontline HIV prevention providers. Finding new solutions that take into account current barriers to adoption as well as program facilitators' practical difficulties with implementation is imperative to ensuring the successful replication of EBIs in real-world settings (see Research Strategy/Background and Significance). The proposed PTab product will harness HIV prevention EBI content compiled at Sociometrics with NIH funding over the last two decades, an online community of practice website successfully developed around these EBIs, a user-focused product development methodology, and the latest in computer and mobile tablet hardware and software technology, to facilitate uptake (adoption and sustained, appropriate use) of HIV prevention EBIs aimed at minority and medically underserved populations.

Therefore, encapsulation of implantable device is critical to its functionality, stability, and longevity. This project addresses one of the key failure modes of current biomedical devices. We are developing a novel encapsulation scheme specifically for neural interfaces with integrated wireless architecture but can be extended to cover other biomedical implants. Our encapsulation scheme will be transformed to manufacturing scale and applied to commercially available neural interfaces from Blackrock Microsystems.

Building on a previous teleretinal screening study that assessed 2,732 South Los Angeles patients for retinopathy, this study deploys machine learning and image processing techniques to detect latent retinopathy in unscreened diabetic patients and partially automate the diabetic retinopathy detection process for teleretinal screening.","6624683 (contact); 1987623; ","OGUNYEMI, OMOLOLA IJEOMA (contact); TAIRA, RICKY K.;","SIM, HUA-CHUAN ","09/30/2016","09/29/2020","abstracting; Address; Adult; Affect; Age; aged; Alaska Native; American Indians; Asian Americans; base; Blindness; Blood Circulation; Blood Vessels; Caring; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.); Chronic; Clinic; Clinical; Complications of Diabetes Mellitus; Computer software; County; Data; Detection; Diabetes Mellitus; diabetic; diabetic patient; Diabetic Retinopathy; Diagnosis; digital; digital imaging; disorder prevention; ethnic minority population; Eye; Glucose; Health Care Reform; Health Insurance; high risk; Hispanics; Image; image processing; Incidence; inner city; laser photocoagulation; Los Angeles; Machine Learning; medical specialties; medically underserved; Methods; Minority Groups; Modeling; Monitor; mortality; Not Hispanic or Latino; novel; Online Systems; Operative Surgical Procedures; Ophthalmic examination and evaluation; Ophthalmologist; Optometrist; outreach; Patient risk; Patients; Pilot Projects; Population; predictive modeling; primary care setting; Primary Health Care; Process; Publishing; racial minority; randomized trial; Reader; Reading; Records; Reporting; Research Personnel; Retina; Retinal; Retinal Diseases; Risk; Risk Factors; Rural; safety net; screening; Services; Software Tools; Specialist; Speed; standard of care; statistics; Techniques; Telemedicine; tool; transmission process; trend; United States; Universities; Work; ","Predicting Diabetic Retinopathy from Risk Factor Data and Digital Retinal Images","012309","BLR","Biomedical Library and Informatics Review Committee ","","A1","01","341726","107441","449167",""

Proper screening and early treatment of ROP is cost-effective and can great- ly reduce vision loss due to ROP, but it is not readily available at many hospitals. At RetiVue LLC, we are de- signing the RetiVue WF, an affordable, portable camera that can accurately detect ROP.

To enable pragmatic socio-technical risk management, we propose to augment game theoretic models: 1) to quantify risk of re-identification attacks with varying levels of data aggregation and adversarial knowledge, 2) to measure the costs associated with managing deterrents to thwart attacks, and 3) to optimize the parameters of deterrence policies given the expected value of genomic data.","9088321; ","MALIN, BRADLEY A.;","MCEWEN, JEAN ","09/21/2012","07/31/2020","Academic Medical Centers; Accounting; Address; Adopted; Agreement; Back; base; Behavior; Case Study; cohort; Collection; Computerized Medical Record; Contracts; Control Groups; cost; Cost Measures; Data; Data Aggregation; Data Collection; Data Set; database of Genotypes and Phenotypes; Databases; design; Detection; Foundations; Funding; Genome; genomic data; Genomic Segment; Genomics; Grant; Health; human subject; Individual; Information Systems; Internet; Investigation; Knowledge; Lead; Length; Life; Link; Measures; Medical center; Modeling; Motivation; Names; Paper; Participant; Peer Review; Phase; phenome; Play; Policies; Policy Maker; precision medicine; Precision Medicine Initiative; Privacy; Probability; Process; Progress Reports; Publications; Published Database; Publishing; Punishment; Records; Reporting; repository; Research; Research Personnel; Research Project Grants; Resources; Risk; Risk Assessment; Risk Management; risk mitigation; Scientist; Services; sharing data; social; Societies; socioeconomics; statistics; System; Theoretical model; theories; Time; tool; Translations; United States National Institutes of Health; Variant; virtual; Work; ","A Risk Management Framework for Identifiability in Genomics Research","006844","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","06","212142","56292","268434",""

We propose to investigate the role of aging in the development of SVD in a mouse model of CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy), the most common genetic form of cerebral SVD, that is caused by dominant mutations involving cysteine residues in the extracellular domain of the Notch 3 receptor and characterized by progressive degeneration smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in the small penetrating arteries of the brain and accumulation of granular osmiophilic material (GOM) in vessel walls. In order to test our hypothesis that the requirements for Notch 3 signaling are higher in old age than during development or at younger ages, we will use aged Notch 3 mutant mice that we generated and characterized in previous publications (Arboleda- Velasquez et al., 2008; Arboleda-Velasquez et al., 2011).

Indeed, even early in the disease process, retinas of Alzheimer's patients can contain amyloid ? (A?) deposits, insoluble protein plaques that inevitably lead to loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), neurons essential for vision. The studies outlined below will seek to provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of RGC loss in Alzheimer's disease, and will strive to create innovative strategies for preventing or attenuating vision loss in patients suffering from this devastating disease.","9625154; ","IVANOV, DMITRY V;","ST.

This leads to increasing number of large-scale imaging studies, including ADNI. However, the overwhelmingly big data poses new challenges to researchers in automated data processing. Thus, modern computational tools are expected to be able to handle the vast amount of data within a manageable time frame. In light of this, we aim to solve this large-scale spatial registration problem ? a critical step directly related to accuracy and precision of imaging biomarkers to be discovered for AD. In particular, we will develop novel deep multi-layer groupwise registration methods for effective, efficient and simultaneous registration of all brain images with possibly large anatomical and appearance differences. Also, to accommodate for new images acquired from the on-going study, an efficient incremental groupwise registration will be further developed to avoid time- and resource-consuming re-registration of all new and existing images from scratch. The development of these advanced computational tools will eventually benefit for discovery of new imaging biomarkers for AD.","7681343; ","SHEN, DINGGANG ;","HSIAO, JOHN ","09/30/2016","06/30/2021","abstracting; Advanced Development; Algorithms; Alzheimer's Disease; Appearance; Automatic Data Processing; base; Big Data; Brain; Brain imaging; Communities; Complex; Computer software; computerized tools; cost; Data; Detection; Documentation; empowered; forest; Goals; Graph; Image; image guided; image registration; imaging biomarker; Imaging Techniques; Imaging technology; improved; Learning; Light; Link; Mainstreaming; Methods; neuroimaging; novel; Play; Process; rapid technique; Research; Research Personnel; Resources; Running; Series; Speed; Subgroup; Time; Update; Work; ","Analyzing Large-Scale Neuroimaging Data in Alzheimer's Disease","053867","BDMA","Biodata Management and Analysis Study Section ","","A1","01","1635432","850425","2485857",""
