Veterans are disproportionately affected for multiple reasons, including injuries and post-traumatic stress disorder. Treatment for chronic pain is a priority research area for the VA. One of the most common causes of chronic pain is osteoarthritis (OA). OA is attributable to ?wear and tear,? but reasons for pain are complex. Inflammatory arthritis (IA) includes multiple severe diseases that affect 2-3% of persons and require treatment with immune-suppressive drugs to prevent joint destruction. Pain often persists despite effective treatment. Pain in arthritis results from multiple sources: inflammation, perception of pain in the joint, and interpretation of pain by the brain. Unfortunately, management of pain in arthritis remains a challenge. Low dose naltrexone is a widely used but unproven ?alternative? approach to chronic pain. It is attractive for study because it is safe and is proposed to work on all three pathways that contribute to pain. A small but high-quality clinical trial is needed to determine whether to invest in definitive studies.","1874329; ","MONACH, PAUL A;","","01/01/2017","12/31/2018","Acupuncture Therapy; Adult; Advocacy; Affect; American; Area; arthritic pain; Arthritis; Back Pain; base; Blinded; Brain; Brief Pain Inventory; Case Study; central pain; central sensitization; Chronic; chronic pain; Clinical assessments; Clinical Trials; Complex; Complex Regional Pain Syndromes; Controlled Clinical Trials; cooperative study; cost; Crohn's disease; Data; Data Reporting; Degenerative polyarthritis; Diagnosis; Disease; Dose; Double-Blind Method; Down-Regulation; effective therapy; Enrollment; Exclusion Criteria; FDA approved; fibromyalgia pain; gastrointestinal symptom; Genetic Crossing Over; Immune; improved; inclusion criteria; individual patient; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Inflammatory Arthritis; Injury; interest; Internet; joint destruction; Joints; Kidney Diseases; Label; Liver diseases; Low Back Pain; Mental disorders; Microglia; Modality; Multiple Sclerosis; Naltrexone; Narcotic Antagonists; Nociception; Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Opioid; opioid use; Oral; Outcome Measure; Pain; Pain interference; Pain management; Pathway interactions; Patient Outcomes Assessments; Patients; Perception; Peripheral; Persistent pain; Persons; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacy facility; Physical therapy; Placebo Control; placebo controlled study; Placebos; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders; prevent; problem drinker; Process; programs; Psychotherapy; Publishing; Quality of life; Randomized; randomized trial; recidivism; Reporting; Research Priority; Rheumatoid Arthritis; Risk; Safety; Scleroderma; secondary outcome; Severities; Source; Spondylarthritis; standard of care; Surveys; treatment response; Veterans; Work; ","Low Dose Naltrexone for Chronic Pain in Osteoarthritis and Inflammatory Arthritis","001513","NURB","Neurobiology B ","","","01","","","",""

Insights from the application of these methods will not only produce a more complete understanding of genetic variants that modulate complex phenotypes, such as common diseases, but will also ensure that currently under-served minority populations, many of whom descend from admixture events or from ancestral groups distinct from those of Europeans, can be studied just as effectively as populations of European descent and can benefit from the discoveries of genomic medicine.","10876378; ","SANKARARAMAN, SRIRAM ;","JANES, DANIEL E","09/15/2014","12/31/2018","Admixture; Affect; African; analytical tool; Asia; base; Complex; Custom; Data; Data Set; design; Diffusion; Disease; Ensure; Estimation Techniques; European; Event; Genetic; Genetic Structures; genetic variant; Genome; genome wide association study; genome-wide; Genomic medicine; Genotype; Goals; Health; Human; Human Genetics; improved; Individual; Inherited; innovation; insight; Maps; Melanesian; Methods; Minority; Modeling; Mutation; Natural Selections; next generation sequencing; Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; novel; Pattern; Phenotype; Population; Population Group; Positioning Attribute; Process; Recording of previous events; reference genome; Research; Research Proposals; SNP array; SNP genotyping; Southern Africa; Statistical Methods; Statistical Models; Structure; Testing; Variant; Variation (Genetics); ","Statistical methods to infer structure and impact of ancient admixture","111744","NSS","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","04","145517","78579","224096",""

We hypothesize that the explanation lies in their diet, which is deficient in fiber and excessively high in fat resulting in suppression of colonic microbial fermentation and the production of short chain fatty acids essential for colonic mucosal health and defense. The high meat, fat and smoked food intake results in increased luminal carcinogens. In order to test this hypothesis, we will conduct a randomized, controlled 4 week trial of high soluble fiber (prebiotic) supplementation in 60 healthy middle aged Alaska Native People in Anchorage, Alaska, designed to increase microbial butyrate production, an essential short chain fatty acid which will improve colonic mucosal health and defense, counteract the cancer effects of luminal carcinogens, and reduce recognized mucosal biomarkers of colon cancer risk. Our results will reveal critical information on how prebiotics could be used to suppress the risk of colon cancer deaths not only in AN, but also in all high risk westernized populations.","2447195 (contact); 11466567; ","O'KEEFE, STEPHEN J.D.

It occurs especially frequently after heart surgery; upwards of one third of patients, including veterans, suffer from it and the side effects such as low blood pressure, stroke, and earlier death. During cardiac surgery, the lining around the heart is disrupted, and the environment around the heart becomes changed from a sterile, clean, inert lubricating fluid to a highly toxic environment, including blood and inflammatory cells and their products. The aim of this grant is to investigate the fluid around the heart after surgery, and define the specific parts which may be contributing to injury to the heart and atrial fibrillation. Furthermore, we will test how the presence of inflammatory cells and their products (found in the fluid) on a dog?s atrium changes the electrical conduction and induction of atrial fibrillation. The long-term goal is to define specific targets in the fluid that can be treated to prevent this common complication.","9615703; ","MELBY, SPENCER J;","","01/01/2017","12/31/2020","Adrenergic beta-Antagonists; Adverse effects; Affect; Amiodarone; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Area; Arrhythmia; Atrial Fibrillation; Atrial Function; base; Bathing; Biological Assay; Blood; Blood Circulation; blood pressure reduction; Canis familiaris; Cardiac; Cardiac Surgery procedures; Cells; Cessation of life; Characteristics; chemokine; Complication; Coronary Artery Bypass; cytokine; Data; Development; Disease; Dose; Drops; effective therapy; Electrophysiology (science); Environment; Flow Cytometry; Generations; Goals; Grant; Heart; Heart Atrium; Hospitals; Hour; Housing; Human; Hydrogen Peroxide; Hypotension; In Vitro; Incidence; Inflammation; Inflammatory; inflammatory marker; Inflammatory Response; Injury; Institution; Intensive Care Units; Interleukin-10; Intervention; Kinetics; Lead; Length; Length of Stay; Leukocytes; Liquid substance; Logistic Regressions; Measures; mitral valve replacement; Modeling; Monitor; monocyte; mortality; Muscle Cells; Myocardium; Myoglobin; neutrophil; Neutrophil Activation; Operative Surgical Procedures; Oxidative Stress; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pericardial body location; Peripheral; peripheral blood; Phase; Physiological; Population; Postoperative Period; prevent; Prevention; Probability; Prophylactic treatment; Reaction; Reactive Oxygen Species; Regression Analysis; Reporting; Right atrial structure; Risk; Sampling; Severities; Statistical Data Interpretation; Sterility; Steroids; Stress; stressor; stroke; Testing; Time; Tissue Model; Tissues; Ventricular Fibrillation; Ventricular Tachycardia; Veterans; White Blood Cell Count procedure; Work; ","Contribution of Inflammation and Oxidative Stress in Pericardial Fluid to Postoperative Atrial Fibrillation After Cardiac Surgery","001526","SURG","Surgery ","","A2","01","","","",""

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is characterized by inability of insulin to suppress glucagon. Like other insulin targets in T2D, alpha cells are insulin-resistant (IR). We propose that ceramide may cause the IR of alpha cells and hence the hyperglucagonemia, without which the hyperglycemia cannot exist. Alpha cells respond to food by lowering secretion of glucagon, so that the liver cannot maintain hyperglycemia. In T2D insulin does not suppress glucagon as it does in nondiabetics. The resulting hyperglucagonemia maintains high rates of hepatic glucose production and high glucose levels. IR in other tissues has been attributed to ectopic lipid deposition with high levels of ceramide, blocking insulin action. Is this the cause of IR in alpha cells?

Surgery is the primary treatment with radiation always a concern and often not offered secondary to long term changes in development and cognitive functions in brain function. Some childhood malignancies, e.g., intrinsic diffuse pontine gliomas - are located such that surgery is not attempted; effective chemotherapy is not available. DM-CHOC-PEN is a polychlorinated pyridine cholesteryloxycarbonate that crosses the blood brain barrier (BBB), accumulates in CNS tumor tissue in humans and has produced objective responses, with acceptable/reversible hepatic toxicities (in patients with prior liver disease) and no evidence of hematological, renal or neuro-toxicities with improved quality of life and overall survival in adul Phase I/II clinical trials - IND - 68,876. The FDA supports a Phase I clinical trial with DM-CHOC-PEN designed to identify safety, toxicities and an acceptable MTD in children with CNS cancers, now that the adult Phase I trial has been completed with safety, acceptable reversible toxicity and MTDs identified. A critical component in designing an agent that will cross the protective blood brain barrier (BBB) is that the agent must be readily transported intracerebrally, does not produce local irritation/neurotoxicity and is not recycled back into the general circulation. DM-CHOC-PEN readily penetrates the BBB, is not a substrate for the transporter protein P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and has shown anticancer activity in CNS tumors. The effective transport of DM-CHOC-PEN into CNS tumors in adults without neurotoxic behavioral alterations and associated events supports the drug's use in children with CNS tumors at an age in which brain development and maturation is in progress with cognitive ability. The drug's unique properties and lack of toxicities noted in the adult studies merits the Phase I trial proposed here in childre. The specific objectives of this Phase I study will be to: 1) Conduct a clinical Phase I trial with DM-CHOC-PEN in children that have advanced cancers involving the central nervous system to document toxicities, define an acceptable maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and identify anticancer activity for the drug. This will be accomplished through IND - 68.876. 2) Studying the pharmacokinetic/dynamic profiles of DM-CHOC-PEN and metabolites in children with advanced cancers involving the central nervous system. 3) Prepare a Phase II clinical trial in children for FDA review. Dr. Johannes Wolff, MD, Chief, Department of Pediatric Oncology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH will be the trial site director.

As we have no effective measures for screening, prevention or early detection, we set out to identify new therapies for this disease through high-throughput drug screens. Our preliminary results show that a subset of ICC tumors with mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) may be extremely susceptible to an oral medication called dasatinib, which has been used safely for years to treat some types of leukemia.

In this work, we propose a comprehensive approach that accounts for all changes in the irradiated volume at every step in the radiation therapy process, thereby significantly reducing dose to the normal portions of the lung and to critical organs.","9259153; ","SAWANT, AMIT ;","CAPALA, JACEK ","09/01/2013","12/31/2018","Accounting; Address; Anatomy; Architecture; base; Brachial plexus structure; Cancer Patient; cancer radiation therapy; Chest; Clinical; Clinical Research; Collaborations; Collimator; Complex; Computer software; Critiques; Data; Dimensions; Dose; Education; Esophagus; experience; Fluoroscopy; Four-dimensional; Fractionated radiotherapy; Freedom; Goals; Health; Heart; Image; improved; in vivo imaging; industry partner; Interdisciplinary Study; interest; Lead; Link; Lung; Malignant neoplasm of lung; Maryland; Medical; Medical center; Modeling; Monitor; Motion; multidisciplinary; Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma; novel; Organ; Patients; Photogrammetry; Physicians; Practice Guidelines; pre-clinical; Primary Neoplasm; Process; Protocols documentation; prototype; quality assurance; Radiation therapy; Radiation Toxicity; reconstruction; Regimen; Reporting; Research; Resolution; respiratory; response; Rotation; simulation; Site; spatiotemporal; Staging; Structure; Structure of parenchyma of lung; Surface; System; Techniques; Testing; three-dimensional modeling; Time; Tissues; tool; Toxic effect; Translations; treatment planning; tumor; Uncertainty; Universities; Utah; Validation; Variant; Work; X-Ray Computed Tomography; ","Personalized Motion Management for truly 4D Lung Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy","169102","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","05","383801","160732","544533",""

The regulatory regions of mRNA often reside on the transcript portion that follows the protein-coding region, namely within 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs). There is extensive evidence that 3'UTRs influence mRNA stability, localization, and translational capacity, by recruiting RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs along with their associated regulatory machineries. We are studying an expected process in the nervous system that lengthens the 3'UTRs of hundreds of transcripts, thus radically altering these regulatory regions. As this process is conserved from insects to humans, we hypothesize that this ancient mechanism of gene regulation is critical for appropriate gene activity in the nervous system. We propose an integrated set of genomewide, genetic, and biochemical approaches to dissect the biology and mechanism of neural 3'UTR lengthening, using both Drosophila and mammalian model systems. The findings from this proposal will have significant impact on revising the annotation of the human genome and will illuminate regulatory processes that are likely to be aberrant in neurological diseases and potentially in cancer.","8706809; ","LAI, ERIC C;","RIDDLE, ROBERT D.","01/15/2014","12/31/2018","3' Untranslated Regions; Algorithms; Animal Model; Animals; Architecture; base; Behavior; Binding Sites; Biochemical; Biological; Biological Models; Biology; Brain; Calmodulin; Cataloging; Catalogs; Cell Line; Cells; Computing Methodologies; crosslink; Data; Data Set; Databases; Development; Dissection; Distal; Drosophila genus; Employee Strikes; Engineering; Equipment and supply inventories; Exhibits; fly; forward genetics; Foundations; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Regulation; gene function; Genes; Genetic; genetic manipulation; Genetic screening method; Genome; genome-wide; Genomics; Health; Homologous Gene; Human; human disease; Human Genome; improved; in vivo; Individual; Insecta; insight; Investments; Knock-in; Knowledge; Length; Location; Malignant Neoplasms; Mammals; Mediating; Messenger RNA; Methods; MicroRNAs; Molecular; Molecular Genetics; mouse genome; Mus; mutant; nervous system disorder; Nervous system structure; Neuraxis; neurodevelopment; Neurologic; neuromechanism; Neuronal Dysfunction; Neurons; Neurophysiology - biologic function; novel; novel strategies; Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences; Open Reading Frames; Pathway interactions; Pattern; Physiology; Polyadenylation; Post-Transcriptional Regulation; Pre-mRNA Polyadenylation Factor; Process; programs; Protein Isoforms; Proteins; Reading; Recruitment Activity; Regulation; Regulator Genes; relating to nervous system; Research; RNA; RNA Interference; RNA Sequences; RNA Stability; RNA-Binding Proteins; screening; Signal Transduction; success; System; Tissues; Transcript; transcriptome; transcriptome sequencing; Transgenic Organisms; trend; Untranslated RNA; Variant; Work; ","Mechanism and biology of widespread distal 3'UTR utilization in the CNS","083833","MNG","Molecular Neurogenetics Study Section ","","","04","244804","188009","432813",""

These prevalence rates, along with 1) the finding that insomnia is a significant risk factor for relapse in abstinent alcoholics and 2) the existence of effective treatments for insomnia, suggests that targeted treatment for insomnia in this population is warranted. The questions that arise at this juncture are 'can standard insomnia treatments be applied to patients with alcoholism' and 'does successful treatment of insomnia have positive reciprocal effects on the comorbid alcoholism (e.g., greater rates of abstinence)?' The proposed study seeks to provide preliminary answers to these questions by evaluating the efficacy of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) in alcoholics. If it is found that CBT-I produces good clinical effects with respect to insomnia and influences the clinical course of the alcoholism, this will suggest that insomnia treatment in general should be a standard component in the management of alcoholism.","11102221; ","CHAKRAVORTY, SUBHAJIT ;","","01/01/2014","12/31/2018","Abate; Abstinence; Accounting; Address; Aftercare; Age of Onset; alcohol craving; Alcohol dependence; alcohol misuse; Alcoholism; alcoholism therapy; Alcohols; Anxiety; anxiety symptoms; awake; Back; base; Beck depression inventory; binge drinking; Biological Markers; Clinical; clinical effect; clinically significant; Cognitive Therapy; Cohort Studies; craving; daily functioning; Data; depressive symptoms; desensitization; design; diaries; Disease remission; drinking; effective therapy; Electroencephalography; Equipment and supply inventories; Evaluation; Exhibits; experience; falls; Family; Family history of; Fatigue; follow-up; gabapentin; General Population; Generalized Anxiety Disorder; Genetic; Goals; Health; health related quality of life; Heavy Drinking; Hour; Hygiene; improved; Incidence; indexing; Individual; Intervention; Investigation; Laboratories; Lead; Maintenance; male; Measures; Mental disorders; Military Personnel; Modality; modifiable risk; Moods; Outcome; Outcome Measure; Participant; Patients; Performance at work; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacotherapy; Phenotype; Placebos; Population; post intervention; Prevalence; Primary Health Care; primary outcome; problem drinker; Protocols documentation; Questionnaires; Randomized; recidivism; Recording of previous events; Recovery; Recurrence; Regimen; Relapse; relapse risk; Replacement Therapy; Research; Risk; Risk Factors; Sampling; Severities; Severity of illness; Sleep; sleep regulation; Sleeplessness; sobriety; Stimulus; targeted treatment; Testing; Time; TimeLine; Training; trait; Trazodone; treatment adherence; treatment effect; Treatment outcome; treatment response; trend; Veterans; Withdrawal; ","The Efficacy of CBT-I in Alcoholics & Its Effects on Remission & Relapse","000855","NURA","Neurobiology A ","","","04","","","",""

Of critical importance, there are few approved antibacterial drugs currently available to treat many Gram-negative bacterial infections and few new drugs in the pipeline. The most difficult to treat pathogens are the Gram-negative bacteria that are resistant to all antibiotics (so called ?Superbugs? containing NDM and KPC enzymes). Most worrisome is their resistant to Imipenem, the ?last line? agent that is used in the most serious cases. We have also found that some Superbugs are also resistant to the recently developed drugs just released (e.g., Avibactam). Even new drugs being developed are at risk. We are taking new approaches based on basic research to understand why resistance to Imipenem and Avibactam occurs in KPC and how resistance to cephalosporins can further emerge in NDMs. We have been extremely fortunate to have built a program that has been at the forefront of new drug resistance research in the VA for nearly 20 years.","1878119; ","BONOMO, ROBERT A.;","","01/01/2013","12/31/2020","Active Sites; Amino Acid Sequence; Amino Acid Substitution; Amino Acids; Ampicillin Resistance; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Antibiotic Resistance; Antibiotics; antimicrobial; Award; bacterial resistance; base; Basic Science; beta-Lactamase; beta-Lactams; Binding; Biochemical; carbapenem resistance; Carbapenems; Catalysis; Cefepime; Ceftazidime; Cephalosporin Resistance; Cephalosporins; chemotherapy; Clinical; Complex; Computer Analysis; Crystallography; design; Drug resistance; Electrons; Enzymes; Escherichia coli; Evolution; Extended-spectrum ?-lactamase; Goals; Gram-Negative Bacteria; Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections; Grant; Healthcare Systems; Hydrolysis; Imipenem; Infection; inhibitor/antagonist; Inorganic Sulfates; insight; interdisciplinary approach; Investigation; Kinetics; Klebsiella pneumonia bacterium; Lead; Learning; Methods; molecular dynamics; Movement; Multienzyme Complexes; Mutagenesis; Mutation; Nature; Nitrogen; novel; novel strategies; novel therapeutics; pathogen; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phenotype; Piperacillin-Tazobactam; Play; Positioning Attribute; programs; Proteins; Research; Resistance; Risk; Role; Serine; Signal Transduction; Structure; Structure-Activity Relationship; Substrate Specificity; Superbug; Time; Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates; Variant; ","The Continuing Challenge of Carbapenemases in K. pneumoniae: KPC-2 & NDM-1","001974","INFB","Infectious Diseases B ","","","05","","","",""

We hypothesize that the histamine cell increase is either the cause, or result of, an inflammatory process that destroys the hypocretin cells in narcolepsy. Inflammation is a central component of Alzheimer?s and Parkinson?s disease. Histamine is known to produce inflammation in the periphery and opens the blood-brain barrier. A better understanding of the destruction of hypocretin and other neurons in narcolepsy will advance our understanding of all 3 disorders.","1859335; ","SIEGEL, JEROME M;","","10/01/2012","09/30/2020","Acetylcholine; Affect; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease; Amphetamines; Amygdaloid structure; Animal Genetics; Animal Model; Animals; Antibodies; Antidepressive Agents; Antigens; Antihistamines; Appearance; Arousal; Autoimmune Diseases; Axon; Blood - brain barrier anatomy; Brain; Brain Injuries; Brain Stem; Canis familiaris; Cataplexy; Cell Count; cell injury; cell killing; Cell Size; Cells; Collection; Data; Denervation; Disease; Dopamine; Drug usage; experience; Failure; gamma hydroxybutyrate; General Population; Genetic; Genetic Models; Genotype; Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein; Gliosis; Golgi Apparatus; Grant; Haplotypes; Histamine; Histidine Decarboxylase; HLA Antigens; Household; Human; Human Genetics; hypocretin; Hypothalamic structure; Immune system; immunoreactivity; In Vitro; Incidence; Infection; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Insect Bites; insight; Investigation; Knockout Mice; Label; Laboratories; Lead; Life; Link; locus ceruleus structure; Mediating; Mediation; Methods; Modeling; Monozygotic twins; Morphology; Mus; mutant; Mutation; Narcolepsy; Nature; Neurodegenerative Disorders; neuron loss; Neurons; Neurotransmitters; Norepinephrine; orexin B receptor; Paper; Parkinson Disease; Pathology; Patients; Pattern; Peptides; Peripheral; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacotherapy; Phenotype; prevent; Process; Publishing; Regulation; Reporting; Research Personnel; response; Role; Secondary to; Serotonin; Silver; Sleep; Staining method; Stains; Substantia nigra structure; Symptoms; System; T-Lymphocyte; Testing; Thinking; Time; Tissues; Toxic effect; venlafaxine; Ventral Tegmental Area; Work; ","What Causes Human Narcolepsy?","001753","NURR","Neurobiology R ","","","05","","","",""

Because of the burden of disease associated with colorectal cancer, the VHA has issued specific directives (VHA Directive 2007-004) describing colorectal cancer screening for the VA. Despite improvements in screening approximately 4500 CRC cases are diagnosed yearly within the VA system. Unfortunately, despite improvement in screening, approximately 650 of these cases are Stage IV which represents a group of patients with abysmal prognoses. Our proposal targets a disease, colorectal cancer, which is very prevalent within the VHA and when combined with our research methodology should provide a strong fit within the VHA research portfolio. In this proposal we describe a novel tight junction associated protein which appears to function as a tumor suppressor by impairing metastasis, a feature found in Stage IV malignancy. The research outlined in this application will broaden our understanding, and Specific Aim 3 is exceptionally translational as we culture human Stage IV colon cancer and test the impact of BVES restoration in culture and in the mouse.","7056252; ","WILLIAMS, CHRISTOPHER S;","","07/01/2012","12/31/2020","adenoma; Affect; Anchorage-Independent Growth; ApcMin/+ mice; Attenuated; base; beta catenin; Binding; Biological; Biological Assay; Biology; Blood Vessels; burden of illness; c-myc Genes; cancer cell; Cancer cell line; cancer diagnosis; Cancer Etiology; carcinogenesis; Carcinoma; Cell Adhesion Molecules; Cell Count; cell motility; Cell Proliferation; Cell-Cell Adhesion; Cells; Clinical; Colitis; Colon; colon cancer cell line; Colon Carcinoma; Colorectal Cancer; colorectal cancer screening; corneal epithelium; Data; design; Diagnosis; diagnostic biomarker; Disease; Dominant-Negative Mutation; Elements; Epithelial; Epithelial Cells; Event; Funding; Gene Expression; genetic approach; Grant; Growth; Healthcare Systems; Human; Hybrids; Hypermethylation; in vivo; Incidence; Inflammatory; insight; Intervention; Intestines; Large Intestine Carcinoma; Lead; Maintenance; Malignant - descriptor; malignant breast neoplasm; Malignant neoplasm of lung; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; Mesenchymal; migration; Modeling; Molecular; monolayer; Morphology; mortality; mouse model; Mus; Mutant Strains Mice; Neoplasm Metastasis; neoplastic cell; new therapeutic target; novel; novel diagnostics; Nuclear; Oncogenic; Organoids; outcome forecast; overexpression; Pathology; Patients; Phenocopy; Phenotype; Play; Polyps; Population; Primary Neoplasm; Process; programs; promoter; Protein Phosphatase 2A Regulatory Subunit PR53; Proteins; Regulation; Reporter; Research; Research Methodology; response; restoration; Role; Sampling; screening; Severe dysplasia; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Staging; Stem cells; Structure; Surveys; System; Techniques; Testing; therapeutic target; Tight Junctions; tumor; Tumor Biology; Tumor Burden; tumor growth; Tumor Suppressor Proteins; tumorigenesis; tumorigenic; United States; United States Department of Veterans Affairs; Work; Xenograft procedure; Yeasts; ","Modulation of junctional signaling by BVES in colorectal carcinoma","001426","ONCC","Oncology C ","","A1","05","","","",""

The risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) varies significantly even in individuals with similar traditional risk factors. Moreover, despite aggressive modification of these risk factors the CVD event rate remains high, suggesting that CVD could be further prevented by additional strategies targeting other pathways. Studies clearly show that atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease. As such, immunomodulatory therapy has been proposed as the next stage for improving prevention of atherosclerotic CVD. Yet, broad- based immunosuppression in humans may have deleterious effects on CVD likely due in part to the fact that not all immune cells are pro-inflammatory. In fact, several immune cell subsets have anti-inflammatory properties and are atheroprotective. Clearly a more comprehensive understanding of immune mechanisms in atherosclerosis is needed for the development of strategies that could promote immune protection from atherosclerosis and limit inflammation. Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) has been implicated in regulating plaque build-up in arteries. We identified immune cells that protect from atherosclerosis (B-1 cells) in the PVAT of mouse and humans. Chemokine receptors (CR) control the trafficking of immune cells and we demonstrate that CR expression on B cells regulate the amount of atheroprotective IgM produced by B cells in PVAT. A fuller understanding and the identification of the mechanisms whereby these CR regulate atherosclerosis in mice and testing for relevance in humans has the potential to lead to novel immune cell targeted therapy for atherosclerosis protection. Our group is uniquely poised to address these important questions and translate these findings rapidly to humans as we have all the animal models and expertise in hand and have an established translational program with the infrastructure needed to test these hypotheses in humans.","1876677; ","MCNAMARA, COLEEN A;","HASAN, AHMED A.K.","01/09/2017","12/31/2020","Accounting; Address; Adipose tissue; Adoptive Transfer; Animal Model; Anti-inflammatory; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Aorta; Apolipoprotein E; Arterial Fatty Streak; Arteries; atherogenesis; atheroprotective; Atherosclerosis; Attenuated; B-Lymphocytes; base; Blood Circulation; BLR1 gene; Bone Marrow; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cause of Death; CCL20 gene; CCR6 gene; Cells; Cessation of life; chemokine; chemokine receptor; Chronic; cohort; Conflict (Psychology); Coronary artery; CXCL12 gene; CXCR4 gene; cytokine; Data; Development; Diet; Disease; Epitopes; Event; Flow Cytometry; Hand; Histology; Homing; Human; Immune; Immunoglobulin M; Immunohistochemistry; improved; indexing; Individual; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Lead; Lipids; Low-Density Lipoproteins; macrophage; Measures; Mediating; Modeling; Modification; MS4A1 gene; Multivariate Analysis; Mus; Natural immunosuppression; novel; oxidation; Pathway interactions; Phenotype; Plasma; Play; prevent; Prevention; Production; programs; Property; receptor; receptor expression; Regulation; Research Infrastructure; response; Risk; Risk Factors; Role; Site; Spleen; Staging; targeted treatment; Testing; trafficking; Translating; Transplantation; Ultrasonography; vascular inflammation; virtual; western diet; ","Local B-1 Regulation of Atherosclerosis","136098","AICS","Atherosclerosis and Inflammation of the Cardiovascular System Study Section ","","","01","496177","287783","783960",""

The studies in this grant proposal focus on the discovery of a new dominant mechanism of resistance to ALK targeted therapy in lung cancer. Findings from our studies will hopefully lead to improved treatments that eliminate resistance by allowing the design of optimal rational combination therapies.

These discrepancies in addiction prevalence, severity, and intervention between Veterans and civilians are known to be heavily influenced by psychosocial factors, such as low adherence to available treatment programs, mental health stigma within military culture, and general problems with reintegration into civilian life. Avoidance behavior is highly prevalent among Veterans and increases the risk for both posttraumatic stress symptoms and SUDs.

My research seeks to understand pathogenic mechanisms in PD by exploring PD related to glucosidase, beta acid 1 (GBA1), a gene identified as the strongest known genetic risk factor for PD. However, most individuals with GBA1 deficiency do not develop PD, suggesting a critical role for genetic modifiers. I will identify modifiers of GBA1 pathogenicity using an unbiased Drosophila genetic screen based on a novel Drosophila GBA1 deficiency model. Preliminary results from this screen have identified modifiers that suggest a model where changes in ceramide cause the neurodegeneration seen in GBA1-associated PD. In addition to testing this hypothesis, I will also test whether modifiers identified by the Drosophila model translate to modification of rate of progression of motor and or cognitive symptoms in patients with PD. The potential impact of this proposal is large, as it could lead to clinically translatable findings, and novel therapeutic targets for PD, a common neurodegenerative disease.","12224356; ","DAVIS, MARIE Y;","","01/01/2017","12/31/2021","Affect; Age; aging population; Area; Autophagocytosis; Autophagolysosome; Autophagosome; Award; base; Biological Assay; Biological Markers; career; Caring; Ceramides; Clinical; clinically relevant; Cognitive; cognitive testing; cohort; Data; Defect; Dietary Supplementation; Disease; Disease model; Disease Progression; Disease susceptibility; Drosophila genus; Enzymes; Evaluation; Fat Body; fly; Gene Frequency; Genes; Genetic; genetic risk factor; Genetic Screening; Glucose; glucosylceramidase; Glucosylceramides; Healthcare Systems; Heterogeneity; Homologous Gene; Human; human disease; Idiopathic Parkinson Disease; Immunoblotting; Impaired cognition; improved; Individual; innovation; insight; interest; Invertebrates; Lead; Learning; Libraries; Link; lipid metabolism; Lipids; locomotor deficit; Longevity; loss of function; Lysosomes; Measures; Mediating; Medical; Mentors; Metabolism; Methodology; Minor; Modeling; Modification; Morphology; Motor; mutant; Mutation; mutation carrier; Nerve Degeneration; Neurobehavioral Manifestations; Neurodegenerative Disorders; new therapeutic target; next generation sequencing; novel; Organelles; overexpression; Parkinson Disease; Pathogenesis; Pathogenicity; Pathologic; Patients; Performance; Phenotype; Play; Predisposition; protein aggregation; protein biomarkers; Proteins; Research; Research Personnel; Risk; Role; screening; Screening Result; sex; Symptoms; Techniques; Testing; thought control; Time; Training; Transferase; Translating; Translations; Variant; Veterans; Work; ","Understanding Susceptibility to Parkinson's Disease due to GBA1 Mutations","003244","NURE","Neurobiology E ","","A1","01","","","",""

The proposed studies will demonstrate the role of key immune pathways in transformed vs primary human myeloid cells, how co-regulation of innate signaling pathways can benefit the virus and provide new therapeutic strategies to treat various inflammatory diseases. The model virus proposed here is Myxoma virus (MYXV), which infects only rabbits in nature, and has significant potential for the treatment of human cancers like myeloid leukemia and multiple myeloma.

This project will test a new hypothesis to explain how genes necessary for formation of osteoblasts, the bone-forming cells, become activated by anabolic signals such as mechanical loading and hormone/growth factor treatment. The central concept to be explored is that anabolic signals activate nuclear protein kinases, enzymes that add a phosphate group to transcription factors to either stimulate or inhibit their activity. Transcriptin factors subsequently regulate the activity of specific genes. We propose that protein kinases stimulate transcription factors necessary for osteoblast formation while inhibiting factors involved in fat cell formation. In this way, bone formation is favored. If correct, our hypothesis provides a new route for stimulating bone formation through pharmacological manipulation of protein kinase activity.","1865627; ","FRANCESCHI, RENNY THEODORE;","WAN, JASON ","09/01/1995","11/30/2017","adipocyte differentiation; Adipocytes; Antibodies; Binding; Biomechanics; bone; Bone Diseases; Bone Regeneration; Bone remodeling; Calvaria; Cell Nucleus; Cells; ChIP-seq; Chromatin; chromatin immunoprecipitation; chromatin remodeling; Defect; Degenerative polyarthritis; Development; Diagnosis; Disease; Docking; Down-Regulation; Embryonic Development; Enzymes; Epigenetic Process; Exposure to; extracellular; Extracellular Matrix; fluid flow; Gene Expression; Gene Targeting; Genes; Genetic Transcription; Genome; Genomics; Global Change; Goals; Health; Histone Acetylation; Hour; in vivo; inorganic phosphate; Integrins; Knock-in Mouse; lipid biosynthesis; Location; Malignant Neoplasms; MAP Kinase Gene; MAPK1 gene; MAPK11 gene; MAPK14 gene; MAPK3 gene; Mechanics; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Modeling; Monitor; morphogens; Natural regeneration; next generation sequencing; Nuclear Protein; osteoblast differentiation; Osteoblasts; Osteogenesis; osteogenic; Osteoporosis; Pathway interactions; Phosphorylation; Phosphorylation Site; Phosphotransferases; Physiological; PPAR gamma; Process; Protein Kinase; PTK2 gene; Regulation; research study; Role; Route; shear stress; Signal Transduction; Site; Skeletal Development; Somatotropin; Stimulus; Testing; Time; transcription factor; Transcriptional Activation; Treatment Factor; Work; ","MAP Kinase Regulation of Osteoblast Function","011723","SBSR","Skeletal Biology Structure and Regeneration Study Section ","","","19","225000","123084","348084",""

It is critical to understand how glutamate receptors are regulated in order to develop novel applications for the treatment and prevention of brain damage resulting after traumatic injury or stroke, as well as neurological disorders associated with altered glutamate receptor function. In addition, while little is known about the function of the retromer and retrograde recycling in neurons, this pathway has been associated with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), because one of the main causative agents of AD, the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP), is recycled and processed to beta-amyloid through this same retrograde pathway. A better understanding of retrograde recycling in neurons should allow us to develop new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for treating and/or preventing AD.","1892743; ","RONGO, CHRISTOPHER G;","TALLEY, EDMUND M","07/01/2001","12/31/2018","Acute; Affect; Alzheimer's Disease; Amyloid beta-Protein; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Animals; BAIAP1 gene; base; Behavior; Behavioral; behavioral plasticity; Biochemical; Biological; biophysical properties; Brain; Brain Injuries; Caenorhabditis elegans; Cells; Chemicals; Communication; Complex; Data; Depressed mood; Detection; Electrophysiology (science); Endocytosis; Endosomes; Environment; Enzymes; Equilibrium; Excision; experience; Face; Family member; forward genetics; Frequencies; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Screening; genome sequencing; Glutamate Receptor; Glutamates; Golgi Apparatus; Guanosine Triphosphate Phosphohydrolases; habituation; Health; In Vitro; in vivo; information processing; Interneurons; Ischemic Stroke; Kinetics; Learning; Life; Link; Locomotion; Long-Term Potentiation; Mechanics; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; Membrane Lipids; Membrane Protein Traffic; Memory; Mental Depression; Molecular; Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins; mutant; Mutation; Nematoda; nervous system disorder; Nervous system structure; neural circuit; Neurodegenerative Disorders; Neurons; Nose; novel; novel diagnostics; novel therapeutic intervention; Pathway interactions; Phenotype; Phosphatidylinositols; Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases; postsynaptic; prevent; Prevention; Process; Proteins; Rab6 protein; receptor; receptor function; receptor recycling; Recruitment Activity; Recycling; response; retrograde transport; Role; Schizophrenia; Sensory; Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Map; Slice; Stimulus; stroke; Synapses; Synaptic plasticity; synaptogenesis; Techniques; Testing; Touch sensation; trafficking; Training; Traumatic Brain Injury; Traumatic injury; Travel; whole genome; yeast two hybrid system; Yeasts; ","Synapse Formation in the C. elegans Nervous System","042023","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","13","214815","115288","330103",""

Hylemon, Ph.D. Title: ?Bile Acids and Clostridium scindens Inhibit C. difficile: Role of Secreted Antibacterial Compounds? Clostridium difficile is the cause of antibiotic associated diarrhea and colitis (AAD&C). Patients on broad-spectrum antibiotics markedly decrease the levels of protective gut microbiota and allows proliferation of C. difficile. Patients with AAD&C are routinely treated with antibiotics but up to 30% relapse after therapy. Recent studies reported that Clostridium scindens, a bacterium that converts cholic acid (CA) to deoxycholic acid (DCA), was highly associated with resistance to C. difficile infection in animal models and patients. This past year, we discovered that C. scindens secretes antibacterial compound(s) that inhibits C. difficile. We also discovered that C. difficile also secretes a 6 amino acid cyclic antibiotic peptide that inhibits C. scindens and other Gram-positive gut bacteria. The studies proposed in this application are aimed at determining the interaction between C. difficile, C. scindens, bile acids and AAD&C.","1888156; ","HYLEMON, PHILLIP B;","","07/01/2012","12/31/2020","Age; Amino Acids; Animal Model; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Antibiotic Therapy; Antibiotics; Bacteria; Bile Acids; Binding; Cells; Cessation of life; Chenodeoxycholic Acid; Cholic Acids; Clinical; Clostridium; Clostridium difficile; Colitis; Colon; Communities; cost; Cyclic Amino Acids; Cyclic Peptides; Deoxycholic Acid; Diarrhea; Doctor of Philosophy; Elderly; Enzymes; fecal transplantation; Gastrointestinal tract structure; General Population; Genes; Goals; Grant; Growth; gut microbiome; gut microbiota; Health; high risk; Hospitals; Human; In Vitro; in vivo; Individual; Infection; Killings; Laboratories; Lithocholic Acid; member; Metronidazole; Nature; pathogenic bacteria; patient population; Patients; Peptide Antibiotics; Population; prevent; Publishing; Relapse; relapse patients; Reporting; Reproduction spores; Resistance; Risk; Role; Secondary to; Structure; Technology; Toxin; transcriptome sequencing; Vancomycin; ","Bile Acids and Clostridium scindens Inhibit C. difficile: Role of Secreted Antibacterial Compounds","001328","GAST","Gastroenterology ","","","05","","","",""

Combinations of external beam irradiation of melanoma metastases with immunotherapy show tremendous promise to extending survival; however, it may not work well in people with disseminated or very small tumors. We propose to test a combination treatment of a melanoma-targeted, systemic radionuclide-based therapy with immunotherapy in mouse models.

Previous studies in families with MVP have shown that early, 'non-diagnostic' forms of MVP often represent early stages of expression in gene carriers. This proposal aims at identifying these 'prodromal' morphologies in the community, assessing their progression, and revealing the genetic determinants involved in the genesis of MVP.

Impairments in specific executive control functions could hinder the effectiveness of prolonged exposure and cognitive processing therapy, the most strongly recommended psychotherapies for Veterans. Therefore, studies assessing the cognitive and neurophysiological factors associated with chronic PTSD are critical. The proposed studies will advance our understanding of the neural correlates of inhibitory control and sustained attention deficits in PTSD, and in turn reveal the factors that can lead to improved performance. When designing novel treatment and rehabilitation protocols, it is important to consider relative strengths in cognitive performance, as well as weaknesses.

We have isolated unique reagents to probe the function of nfRas in cells and animal models for cancer. Our work will define a new paradigm in Ras signaling that has important implications for our understanding of Ras-driven cancers. Given the evolutionary conservation of Ras and its involvement in human biology, these studies are of broad interest to many investigators.

However, its success is dependent on the induction of an immunologically mediated reaction known as graft vs tumor (GVT), which can be complicated by the initiation of adverse events such as graft versus host disease (GVHD) post-transplant. Increasingly, preclinical testing to find therapies to modulate GVHD while maintaining GVT have come under scrutiny for their inaccuracies in predicting patient outcomes in human clinical trials. In this grant application we propose that the discrepancy between preclinical testing and clinical outcomes is, at least in part, due to the vast majority of preclinical testing making use of lean specific-pathogen-free (SPF) animal models which may not be reflective of the real world clinical experience. The CDC currently estimates that more than two-thirds of US adults are either overweight or obese, and therefore we are proposing that the pre-existing inflammatory profiles present obesity are directly correlative to increased risk for GVHD pathogenesis and reduced GVT responses. Accounting for this phenotype in both murine and non-human primate models, we will demonstrate that addition of intervention therapeutics can limit GVHD pathogenesis while maintaining GVT responses within obese models.","1942214; ","MURPHY, WILLIAM JOSEPH;","MCCARTHY, SUSAN A.","01/12/2017","12/31/2021","Accounting; Acute Graft Versus Host Disease; Adult; Adverse event; Affect; aged; Allogenic; Animal Model; Anti-inflammatory; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Applications Grants; Autologous; base; Body Composition; Bone Marrow Transplantation; Caloric Restriction; Cancer Patient; cancer type; cell type; Cells; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.); Cessation of life; Chronic; Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease; Clinic; Clinical; Clinical Trials; cohort; conditioning; curative treatments; cytokine; Data; Development; Diet; Disease Progression; Ecology; Environment; Equilibrium; experience; Functional disorder; germ free condition; Graft-Versus-Tumor Induction; Graft-vs-Host Disease; Hematologic Neoplasms; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; high risk; Human; Immune; Immune response; Immune system; Immunity; immunopathology; Immunotherapeutic agent; Inbred Mouse; Incidence; Individual; Indolent; Infiltration; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Inflammatory Response; Intervention; Intestines; Investigation; Light; Link; macrophage; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; microbial; microbiome; Modeling; Molecular Target; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Mus; nonhuman primate; Obese Mice; Obesity; Organ; Outcome; Overweight; Pathogenesis; Pathologic; Pathology; Patient-Focused Outcomes; Permeability; Phenotype; Play; Population; pre-clinical; prebiotics; Preclinical Testing; Process; Production; Publishing; radiation response; Radiation therapy; Reaction; reconstitution; Recovery; Recruitment Activity; Regimen; Relapse; Research; response; Risk; Role; success; T cell response; T-Lymphocyte; targeted agent; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Intervention; therapy development; Toxic effect; Transplantation; Transplantation Conditioning; tumor; tumor progression; ","Multispecies Comparison of the Impact of Obesity on GVHD/GVT","214048","CII","Cancer Immunopathology and Immunotherapy Study Section ","","","01","406700","224032","630732",""

It is well established that RA inhibits carcinoma cell growth by regulating gene transcription, a function exerted through activation of the transcription factor termed RAR. Activation of RAR by RA is supported by cellular RA-binding protein II (CRABP-II), a protein that directly delivers RA from the cytosol to nuclear RAR. Intriguingly, our recent observations showed that, in addition to its established role as a carrier for RA, CRABP-II is involved in regulation of post-transcriptional gene silencing, and that it does so by cooperating with HuR, the best characterized regulator of mRNA stability in animals from drosophila to man. The proposed studies are designed to explore the possibility that anticarcinogenic activities of CRABP-II and RA are mediated in part through their involvement in regulating mRNA stability. The studies aim to investigate the molecular basis for the cooperation of CRABP-II with HuR in stabilizing mRNA, and to explore the involvement of this cooperation in mammary carcinoma biology. At the level of basic science, the results of these studies will provide important insights into a previously unsuspected non-genomic function of RA as well as into a novel mechanism for regulating transcript stability in cells. The findings of this work may also point at a novel target for therapeutic approaches in cancer treatment.","1883507; ","DRISCOLL, DONNA M;","STRASBURGER, JENNIFER ","01/01/2013","12/31/2017","activating transcription factor; Affinity; Animals; Apoptosis; Apoptotic; base; Basic Science; Binding; Binding Proteins; Biological; Biological Process; Biology; biophysical properties; Breast Carcinoma; cancer cell; cancer therapy; Caspase; Cell Cycle Arrest; cell growth; Cell Nucleus; Cell physiology; Cell Proliferation; Cell Proliferation Regulation; Cell Survival; Cells; cellular retinoic acid binding protein II; Chemopreventive Agent; Complex; Cytosol; Data; design; Drosophila genus; Family; Gene Expression; Gene Targeting; Genes; Genetic Transcription; Health; insight; Ligands; Ligation; Malignant Epithelial Cell; Malignant neoplasm of prostate; Malignant Neoplasms; Mammary Neoplasms; man; Mediating; member; Messenger RNA; Molecular; mRNA Stability; new therapeutic target; non-genomic; novel; Nuclear; Nuclear Receptors; Property; Proteins; receptor; Regulation; Research Design; response; RNA Interference; Role; Stimulus; Transcript; transcription factor; Tretinoin; Tumor Suppressor Proteins; Vitamin A; Work; ","Retinoic acid and CRABP-II in regulation of post transcriptional gene silencing","166955","INMP","Integrative Nutrition and Metabolic Processes Study Section ","","","05","185292","108395","293687",""

COPD causes significant morbidity and mortality and is a serious medical, financial and emotional burden on Veterans and their families. No current therapy exists to halt the progressive lung destruction of COPD. We have shown that a type of lung cell, called natural killer cells (NKs) are able to kill epithelial lung cells and that this killing is increased in COPD patients and could be contrib- uting to COPD pathogenesis. NKs also produce the protein IL-22, which can drive epithelial cells to make pro-inflammatory molecules, further contributing to COPD. This proposal will use both human lung tissue and a mouse model of cigarette smoke exposure to study NKs. The goal of this study is to identify ways to inhibit NK-mediated lung destruction that could be targeted for therapeutic benefit.","10138686; ","BASMAJIAN, CHRISTINE M.;","","04/01/2012","12/31/2020","Adhesions; Air; airway inflammation; Apoptosis; Autologous; Binding; Binding Proteins; Biological Availability; Cause of Death; CD94 Antigen; Cell Adhesion; cell injury; cell killing; cell type; Cells; Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease; cigarette smoke; clinically relevant; cytokine; Cytoplasmic Granules; cytotoxic; cytotoxicity; Data; Dendritic Cells; Diagnosis; Disease Progression; Emotional; Environment; environmental tobacco smoke exposure; Epithelial; Epithelial Cells; Excision; Family; Female; Goals; Granzyme; Healthcare; Hospitals; Human; human tissue; Immune system; immunological synapse; immunological synapse formation; In Vitro; Inflammatory; interleukin-22; Ions; Killings; Lead; lead-binding proteins; Lung; Lung Inflammation; Lymphocyte; Lytic; male; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; Medical; Modeling; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; mouse model; Mus; Natural Killer Cells; NCAM1 gene; novel; novel therapeutic intervention; Pathogenesis; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Patients; perforin; peripheral blood; Phase; Process; Production; Proteins; Publishing; Pulmonary Emphysema; receptor; Receptor Signaling; Signal Transduction; Smoker; Stress; Structure of parenchyma of lung; targeted treatment; Testing; Therapeutic; therapeutic target; Time; Translating; United States; Veterans; ","Cross-talk between lung natural killer cells and dendritic cells in COPD","001553","PULM","Respiration ","","A1","04","","","",""

A cell type called the monocyte/macrophage is critical to development and complications of atherosclerosis. This project will evaluate the effectiveness of a medication called Eplerenone in preventing atherosclerosis in Type II diabetes through its effects on cells such as the monocyte. Eplerenone is scheduled to become generic in 2015 and has been demonstrated to be effective for the treatment of patients after a heart attack and stroke. We will evaluate the impact of Eplerenone in reducing atherosclerosis plaque and additionally evaluate its potential in changing inflammation. We envision that our strategy of simultaneously probing effect of a drug combined with analysis of mechanisms of action and predictive response will likely provide key information with which to design hard event (heart attack, stroke etc.) based trials.","6778000 (contact); 2419428; ","RAJAGOPALAN, SANJAY  (contact); WEIR, MATTHEW R.;","FLEG, JEROME ","01/01/2016","12/31/2020","3' Untranslated Regions; Affect; Aldosterone; Arterial Fatty Streak; Arteries; Atherosclerosis; base; Binding; Biology; Blood Pressure; Blood Vessels; Boxing; Cardiovascular system; cell type; Cells; Clinical Trials; Complex; Computer Simulation; Data; design; Development; diabetic patient; Disease; Disease Pathway; Disease Progression; Double-Blind Method; effective therapy; Effectiveness; eplerenone; Event; Experimental Models; Flow Cytometry; Foundations; Future; Gene Expression; Generic Drugs; Genes; Glossary; Grant; Heart failure; hemodynamics; high risk; Hour; Human; Inflammation; Inflammatory; inhibitor/antagonist; Initiator Codon; insight; Insulin Resistance; Laboratories; Lead; Ligands; Light; Link; macrophage; Macrophage Activation; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Measures; Metabolic; Methodology; Methods; MicroRNAs; Mineralocorticoid Receptor; Mineralocorticoids; monocyte; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Myocardial Infarction; Necrosis; Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; novel; novel marker; NR3C2 gene; Obesity; Open Reading Frames; Outcome; Outcome Measure; Pathway interactions; Patients; peripheral blood; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phenotype; Physiologic pulse; Placebo Control; Placebos; Play; predicting response; Predisposition; prevent; primary outcome; promoter; prospective; protein expression; public health relevance; Randomized; Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials; Randomized Controlled Trials; receptor; Receptor Activation; receptor expression; Receptor Gene; Regulation; Renin-Angiotensin System; Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System; Reporter; research clinical testing; Resolution; response; Response Elements; Risk Marker; Role; Schedule; secondary outcome; Small Interfering RNA; stroke; Testing; Therapeutic Effect; Thoracic aorta; TNF gene; Transcript; tumor; Untranslated Regions; ","MINERALOCORTICOID RECEPTOR ANTAGONISM CLINICAL EVALUATION IN ATHEROSOCLEROSIS (MAGMA)","127422","CICS","Clinical and Integrative Cardiovascular Sciences Study Section ","","","02","482769","145692","628461",""
