This study will test the effectiveness of an automated telehealth program to enhance quality of life by reducing psychiatric symptoms and limiting use of disruptive and expensive health care services such as emergency room visits and hospitalizations, while also investigating potential ways the program might work (mechanisms of action), with the broader goal of learning how to better serve other at-risk individuals who are isolated or difficult to engage in conventional clinic-based health care.","7355898; ","PRATT, SARAH ILANA;","JULIANO-BULT, DENISE M.","09/03/2015","04/30/2019","Accident and Emergency department; Acute; Address; Admission activity; Adult; base; Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale; Caring; Chronic; Clinic; Clinical; Communication; Communities; Community Mental Health Centers; compare effectiveness; cost; Cost Analysis; cost effective; Data; Devices; Disadvantaged; Disease; early experience; Effectiveness; Emergency department visit; Evaluation; Expenditure; Family; Future; Goals; Health; Health Care Costs; health care service; health disparity; Healthcare; high risk; Home environment; Hospital Costs; Hospitalization; Hospitals; Housing; improved; Individual; Interruption; Intervention; Learning; Length of Stay; Life; Low income; Measures; Mediating; Medical; medication compliance; Mental disorders; Mental Health; Modeling; Monitor; monitoring device; Outcome Study; Outpatients; Participant; Patient Self-Report; Persons; Pilot Projects; Policies; Population; prevent; primary outcome; Productivity; programs; Provider; provider intervention; psychiatric symptom; Public Health; Quality of life; Randomized; Randomized Controlled Trials; Recovery; Relapse; relapse risk; Research; Risk; Self Management; Services; severe mental illness; Severities; Societies; Specialist; standard of care; Substance abuse problem; Symptoms; telehealth; Testing; Time; Training; Travel; treatment as usual; Underachievement; Vulnerable Populations; Work; ","Automated Telehealth to Improve Psychiatric Self-Management and Community Tenure","107625","ZMH1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","03","547624","137010","684634",""

Unfortunately, the re-operation rates reported in the literature to obtain a negative margin range from 17-59% and as a result can compromise this procedure. Generating surgical technologies that could improve the fidelity of resection would have dramatic impact to a considerable population of patients (nearly 230,000 women per year in the United States alone with 80% being detected at stages 0, 1, or 2) especially when considering average recurrence rates of 22% when positive margins are found. In this exploratory work, we will investigate the combination of computational modeling techniques with surgical navigation and interventional imaging technologies to improve localization of tumors intraoperatively for the purpose of improving the fidelity and reliability o single-pass negative-margin resection for breast conserving surgery (BCS).","2094654; 6706151 (contact); ","MESZOELY, INGRID M; MIGA, MICHAEL IAN (contact);","PAI, VINAY MANJUNATH","07/01/2016","04/30/2018","Address; Algorithms; Anatomy; base; Biological Markers; biomechanical model; Biomechanics; Breast; Breast Diseases; breast lumpectomy; Breast-Conserving Surgery; Cancerous breast; Complex; Computer Simulation; contrast enhanced; Cues; Data; Detection; Devices; Diagnostic; Diagnostic Imaging; Disease; Encapsulated; Excision; experience; Financial compensation; Health; Image; imaging biomarker; imaging detection; imaging probe; imaging study; Imaging Techniques; Imaging technology; improved; improved outcome; intraoperative imaging; Investments; Lasers; Lesion; Light; Literature; Location; Magnetic Resonance; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; malignant breast neoplasm; Malignant Neoplasms; Mammary Gland Parenchyma; Mastectomy; Measures; Methods; Modeling; National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project; Nature; novel; Operating Rooms; operation; Operative Surgical Procedures; optical imaging; Pathology; Pathology Report; patient population; Patients; photonics; Procedures; Radiation; Radiation therapy; Radical Mastectomy; Recurrence; Reporting; Resected; Retrieval; Risk; Scanning; Simple mastectomy; soft tissue; Staging; stem; Surgeon; Surgical margins; Survival Rate; System; Techniques; Technology; Testing; trend; tumor; Ultrasonography; Uncertainty; United States; Woman; Work; ","A Computational Model-Enhanced Approach for Tumor Localization During Lumpectomy","022380","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","125000","64325","189325",""

Using a new HIV reporter tool to study latency, we have recently observed that latency was significantly more prevalent in CD4 T cells isolated from oral lymphoid tissues (tonsil) than in CD4 T cells from peripheral blood or spleen. In addition, latency in CD4 T cells from oral lymphoid tissues was strongly dependent on the presence of non-CD4 T cells. Thus, the biology of latency and its reactivation may differ in primary oral lymphoid tissues when compared to other lymphoid tissues. If so, therapeutic interventions might need to be modified to account for the unique characteristics of latency in peripheral lymphoid tissues, including primary oral lymphoid tissues. We will use a multi-pronged, systems-biology strategy to further define HIV latency and its mechanism in primary oral lymphoid tissues. We will use our new HIV-1 reporter to identify, quantify, and purify latently infected cells in their native state early after infection. By combinng our dual-fluorescence latency model with powerful systems biology techniques and the tonsil HLAC system, we expect to significantly increase our understanding of HIV latency and to identify potential new therapeutic opportunities.","1890767; ","VERDIN, ERIC M.;","GANNOT, GALLYA ","04/01/2016","01/31/2021","Affect; antiretroviral therapy; B-Lymphocytes; Biological Markers; Biology; Blood; CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Cell surface; Cell Surface Proteins; Cells; Cessation of life; Characteristics; Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats; Cytometry; Dendritic Cells; design; experimental study; Fluorescence; Frequencies; Gene Expression; Gene Proteins; Genes; Gut associated lymphoid tissue; Half-Life; HIV; HIV Genome; HIV-1; Human; In Vitro; Infection; Killings; knock-down; Latent Virus; Life; Light; lymph nodes; Lymphocyte; Lymphoid Tissue; macrophage; memory CD4 T lymphocyte; MicroRNAs; Modeling; Molecular Profiling; Mutation; novel; novel therapeutics; Oral; Pathway interactions; Patients; Peripheral; peripheral blood; Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell; Phenotype; Primary Infection; Proteins; Proviruses; public health relevance; Receptor Signaling; Regulator Genes; Reporter; Rest; Role; Shock; Signal Transduction; single cell analysis; small molecule; Source; Spleen; System; Systems Biology; T-Cell Activation; T-Cell Receptor; T-Lymphocyte; T-Lymphocyte Subsets; Techniques; Technology; Testing; Therapeutic Intervention; Tissues; Tonsil; tool; transcriptome; transcriptome sequencing; Viral; Viral reservoir; Virus; Virus Latency; ","Novel model for HIV Latency in Oral Primary Lymphoid Tissues","026010","ZDE1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","03","361800","302254","664054",""

Up to 40% of cancer patients treated with chemotherapy describe some form of CIPN, with sensory neuropathy being dominant. Symptoms vary from tingling and numbness indicative of sensory loss to aspects of painful neuropathy such as allodynia and spontaneous shooting pains. The American Society of Clinical Oncology makes no recommendations for the prevention of CIPN and provides only a moderate recommendation for treatment with duloxetine, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor for symptomatic relief of pain. WinSanTor?s founders have uncovered a new homeostatic mechanism in sensory neurons that constrains mitochondrial function, which can be exploited to improve energy supply to reverse and to prevent nerve damage in CIPN. We have demonstrated that the muscarinic acetylcholine type 1 receptor (M1R) signaling limits mitochondrial activity and that antagonizing M1R increases the overall respiratory capacity of mitochondria. Additionally, we have observed that the M1R antagonist pirenzepine can prevent the neuropathy induced by chemotherapeutic agents. The goal of this Phase I STTR project is to assess the therapeutic potential of pirenzepine as a CIPN intervention that enhances neuronal AMPK activity and restores neuronal energy capacity to prevent or reverse neuropathy without impeding the chemotherapeutic microtubule-stabilizing properties of paclitaxel. To this end our Specific Aims are: Specific Aim 1. Assess the tumoricidal activity of paclitaxel in presence of pirenzepine. Specific Aim 2. Test efficacy of pirenzepine in mouse paclitaxel models of CIPN. The studies proposed herein will advance further pre-clinical development of pirenzepine as a potentially first- in-class therapy for preventing and/or reversing CIPN.","14456751; ","MIZISIN, ANDREW ;","WEBER, PATRICIA A","05/23/2017","04/30/2018","5'-AMP-activated protein kinase; Acetylcholine; Adult; Afferent Neurons; Affinity; allodynia; American Society of Clinical Oncology; Anabolism; base; Breast Cancer cell line; Cancer Patient; cancer therapy; chemotherapeutic agent; chemotherapy; Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy; cholinergic; Complication; Confocal Microscopy; Cornea; Country; Coupled; curative treatments; Data; density; Development; diabetic; Diabetic Neuropathies; Diagnosis; Disease; Distal; Dose; Dose-Limiting; duloxetine; efficacy testing; Energy Supply; Epidermis; experience; Fiber; Goals; Growth; Hyperalgesia; improved; In Vitro; indexing; inhibitor/antagonist; Intervention; Life Expectancy; Measures; Microtubules; Mitochondria; mitochondrial dysfunction; Mitochondrial Proteins; Modeling; Monitor; Mus; Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor; Muscarinic M1 Receptor; Muscarinics; Natural regeneration; Nerve; Nerve Fibers; Neural Conduction; Neurites; Neurons; Neuropathy; Norepinephrine; novel; novel therapeutic intervention; novel therapeutics; Numbness; Paclitaxel; Pain; painful neuropathy; Patients; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases; Phase; Pirenzepine; preclinical development; prevent; Prevention; Preventive Intervention; Preventive treatment; Property; Quality of life; receptor; Receptor Signaling; Recommendation; Regimen; Reporting; Respiration; respiratory; response; Response Latencies; reuptake; Rodent; Role; Safety; sciatic nerve; Secondary to; Sensory; sensory neuropathy; Serotonin; Signal Transduction; Skin; Small Business Technology Transfer Research; Structure; Symptoms; Tactile; Therapeutic; transcription factor; Treatment Efficacy; Treatment Protocols; Work; ","Development of Pirenzepine for CIPN","213555","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","01","","","298550",""

Until now, Y chromosome research has focused solely on two functions: sex determination and sperm production. Recent studies in our laboratory have revealed that that many of the uncharacterized genes on the human Y chromosome are likely to have important and widespread biological functions, and we hypothesize that the disruption of these genes may contribute to disease. Our studies will open the door to investigating new treatment strategies and clinical research into a host of human diseases like Turner syndrome and diseases that exhibit sex differences in prevalence, susceptibility, and severity.","11763608; 1896183 (contact); ","MUENKE, MAXIMILIAN ; PAGE, DAVID C (contact);","WISE, ANASTASIA LEIGH","05/18/2015","04/30/2018","Affect; base; Biological Process; Biology; Blood; body system; Cells; ChIP-seq; chromatin modification; Chromosome abnormality; Chromosomes, Human, Y; Clinical; Clinical Research; Complex; Defect; defined contribution; design; Disease; dosage; Ensure; Epigenetic Process; epigenetic profiling; Etiology; Evaluation; Exhibits; experience; Failure; Female; Future; Gender; Gene Expression Regulation; Genes; genome-wide; Genomic medicine; Genomics; Genotype; Health; Hereditary Disease; Histones; Homologous Gene; Human; Human Biology; human disease; Human Genetics; Individual; insight; Institute of Medicine (U.S.); Knowledge; Laboratories; Lead; Light; Link; Lysine; male; Maps; Molecular; molecular phenotype; Noonan Syndrome; patient oriented; Patients; Pattern; Phenotype; Physiological; Play; Positioning Attribute; Predisposition; pressure; Prevalence; Production; Recruitment Activity; Recurrence; Regulator Genes; Reporting; Reproduction; reproductive; reproductive tract; Research; research clinical testing; Resources; RNA Splicing; Role; Severities; sex; Sex Bias; Sex Characteristics; sex determination; Skin; sperm cell; Spermatogenesis; Structure; Testing; Testis; Transcript; transcription factor; transcriptome sequencing; treatment strategy; Turner's Syndrome; United States National Academy of Sciences; United States National Institutes of Health; whole genome; Y Chromosome; ","Beyond the reproductive tract: The future of Y chromosome research","007587","GNOM","National Human Genome Research Institute Initial Review Group ","","","03","233702","222017","455719",""

The  pathogenesis of progressive MS, for which no effective disease modifying treatments have yet been  developed, is particularly unclear. One reason the field has been slow to fully understand MS is that CNS  tissue sampling is rare (due to potential to cause harm), and the disease changes with time. We developed a  new imaging method for use in MS to detect and measure loss of myelin and nerve fibers, as well as  inflammation. Using a clinical MRI scanner, this is a non-invasive and safe way to 'see' the underlying  pathology in brains of people with MS. Upon validation, this method will lead to better understanding of the  underlying MS disease process, and should also improve our ability to test new treatments.","6608054; ","CROSS, DOROTHY ANNE;","","","","Acute; Advocate; Affect; Animal Model; Area; Atlases; Autopsy; Axon; axon injury; base; Biological Markers; Biological Preservation; Biopsy; black hole; Blood; Brain; Cellularity; Chronic; Classification; Clinical; clinical imaging; clinical predictors; Clinical Trials; Cognitive; Data; Demyelinations; Detection; Deterioration; Development; Diffusion; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; disability; Disease; Edema; Enhancing Lesion; Enrollment; Evolution; Fiber; forest; Funding; Gadolinium; gadolinium oxide; Histologic; Histology; Histopathology; Human; Image; imaging approach; imaging modality; Imaging Techniques; improved; in vivo; Individual; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Injury; innovation; Lead; Lesion; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Measures; Methods; mind control; Modeling; mouse model; MRI Scans; Multiple Sclerosis; Multiple Sclerosis Lesions; multiple sclerosis patient; Mus; Myelin; Nerve Fibers; neuropathology; novel; novel therapeutics; Outcome; outcome forecast; Pathogenesis; Pathologic; Pathology; Patients; Play; Population; predict clinical outcome; Process; Relapse; relating to nervous system; remyelination; repaired; Resolution; Role; Sampling; Scanning; Severities; Specificity; Specimen; spectrograph; Staging; System; Techniques; Testing; Therapeutic; Time; Tissue Sample; Tissues; Translating; Validation; Water; white matter; ","BIOMARKERS AND PATHOGENESIS OF MS: FROM MOUSE TO HUMAN","059560","NSD","National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Initial Review Group ","5151","","09","214787","112764","","327551"

They are unable to participate in colonoscopy performed with sedation, because they do not have anyone who can give them a ride after the examination. Colonoscopists do turn to unsedated colonoscopy to meet the Veterans' need. Other Veterans prefer to avoid sedation altogether, due to unpleasant flashbacks potentially triggered under sedation, or for other personal reasons (e.g., follow the examination awake, no need for recovery or activity restrictions after colonoscopy to save time). They are willing to try unsedated colonoscopy.

Plerixafor is a relatively an agent that has enhanced mobilization of stem cells when combined with filgrastim, but its main drawback is high cost. We have studied the effects of simple non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), which inhibit prostaglandins, on the bone marrow and blood forming stem cells. Our data in animal models indicate that NSAID can significantly enhance the mobilization of stem cells, yielding a graft with possible better engraftment potential. We propose a phase II clinical trial to translate our preclinical dat and develop a novel, inexpensive, and potentially more efficacious regimen for mobilization of stem cells, and include correlative studies that will help us to better understand the targeting of the bone marrow niche for improving stem cell mobilization.","6916513 (contact); 2060962; ","FARAG, SHERIF S (contact); PELUS, LOUIS M;","MERRITT, WILLIAM D.","05/01/2014","04/30/2019","Animal Model; Anti-inflammatory; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Area; Autologous; Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation; B-Lymphocytes; Biological; Blood; Blood Component Removal; Blood Platelets; Bone Marrow; CD34 gene; Cells; chemotherapy; Clinical; Collecting Cell; Collection; Correlative Study; cost; cost effective; CSF3 gene; CXCR4 gene; Data; Dendritic Cells; Dinoprostone; Disadvantaged; Disease; Disease remission; Dose; Economics; Engraftment; Enzymes; Filgrastim; Future; Gene Chips; Genes; Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor; Growth Factor; Health; Hematologic Neoplasms; Hematopoiesis; Hematopoietic; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization; Hematopoietic stem cells; High Dose Chemotherapy; Immune; immunoregulation; improved; interest; large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; Mediating; meloxicam; Modality; Molecular; Multiple Myeloma; Myelogenous; Natural Killer Cells; Nature; neutrophil; Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma; novel; Ontology; Pathway interactions; Patients; peripheral blood; Peripheral Blood Stem Cell; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase II Clinical Trials; Platelet Count measurement; pre-clinical; Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase; Prostaglandins; Proteasome Inhibitor; Publications; Recovery; Regimen; Relapse; Reporting; Resources; Role; Safety; small molecule; Source; Stem cells; success; symposium; T-Lymphocyte Subsets; Time; trafficking; Translating; Transplantation; United States Food and Drug Administration; ","Inhibition of PGE2 for mobilization of autologous peripheral blood stem cells","182947","CONC","Clinical Oncology Study Section ","","","04","206367","115566","321933",""

The goals are to decrease bladder tumor recurrence and progression rates, broaden therapeutic applicability, use novel treatment protocols and improve outcomes for early bladder cancer patients. Using robust preliminary data and a 'toolbox' of approaches to directly measure the treatment effects on bladder cancer cells, the investigators will define how established treatments affect a tumor response. Based on this, the researchers will design and test strategies to increase treatment effectiveness and reduce treatment-associated risks. As bladder cancer occurs with a threefold increased incidence in men compared to women, and has a peak incidence during the sixth and seventh decades of life, this disease and the findings from this study have a high relevance to the patient population served by the VA.","1871383; ","SEE, WILLIAM A;","","10/01/2014","09/30/2018","Address; Adverse effects; Affect; antitumor effect; Antitumor Response; Apoptotic; Attenuated; Bacillus (bacterium); base; Binding; biological adaptation to stress; Bladder Neoplasm; cancer cell; Cancer Patient; Cell Cycle Arrest; cell injury; Cells; chemokine; Clinic; Clinical; clinical efficacy; Clinical Treatment; cytokine; Data; design; Disease; Effectiveness; Elements; Enzymes; Free Radicals; Funding; Gene Expression; Generations; Genes; Goals; Health; Heating; high risk; HMGB1 gene; Human; Hydrogen Peroxide; improved; improved outcome; In Vitro; in vivo; Incidence; insight; Intervention; intravesical; Killings; Leukocytes; Life; Malignant Epithelial Cell; Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder; Measures; Mediating; meetings; men; Mycobacterium bovis; Nature; Necrosis; novel; Outcome; Oxidants; oxidative damage; Oxidative Stress; Oxidative Stress Pathway; Pathway interactions; patient population; Patients; Pharmacogenetics; Phenotype; Production; Publishing; receptor; Recurrence; Research Personnel; Resistance; response; Risk; Role; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; SOD2 gene; Staging; standard of care; Superoxides; System; Testing; Therapeutic; TimeLine; Toxic effect; Transactivation; Transitional Cell Carcinoma; treatment effect; Treatment Effectiveness; Treatment Efficacy; Treatment outcome; Treatment Protocols; treatment strategy; tumor; Woman; ","BCG-Induced Oxidative Stress as a Target for Improved Clinical Efficacy","002242","CAMM","Cellular and Molecular Medicine ","","","03","","","",""

Skin cancers are by far the most common cancer seen in humans and exerts a large burden on the veteran population. Methods to reduce the rates of skin cancer formation or improved methods to treat advanced skin cancers are needed. UV increases skin cancer risk in part by suppressing the immune system that normally eliminates developing tumor cells. This study will examine a class of drugs which are known to activate a nuclear protein called peroxisome proliferators activated receptor ?. We will examine whether these drugs promote skin cancer clearance by blocking the ability of UV to suppress the immune system. Radiation therapy also suppresses the immune system. We will also determine whether these drugs also increase the effectiveness of radiation therapy by reversing the radiation treatment-induced immunosuppression.","1878247; ","KONGER, RAYMOND L;","","04/01/2017","03/31/2021","Adverse effects; Agonist; antitumor effect; Area; base; C57BL/6 Mouse; cancer risk; Chemopreventive Agent; cis acting element; Classification Scheme; Cleaved cell; Complex; Confusion; Contact hypersensitivity; Cutaneous; Data; Defect; design; Effectiveness; Epidermis; Event; Exhibits; External Beam Radiation Therapy; Gene Targeting; Genes; Growth; high risk; Human; Immune; Immune checkpoint inhibitor; immune function; Immune response; Immune system; Immunodeficient Mouse; immunogenic; immunoregulation; Immunosuppressive Agents; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; Individual; Inflammation; Inflammatory; insight; Integral Membrane Protein; Intervention; Ionizing radiation; Length; Ligands; lipid biosynthesis; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; melanoma; Methods; Military Personnel; Mus; Natural immunosuppression; neoplastic cell; Nuclear Protein; Nuclear Receptors; Oxidative Stress; PDCD1LG1 gene; Peroxisome Proliferators; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Play; Population; PPAR gamma; pre-clinical; Process; Production; Proteins; Radiation therapy; Regulation; response; Response Elements; Roentgen Rays; Role; rosiglitazone; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Skin Cancer; Skin Neoplasms; Sunlight; System; T-Lymphocyte; Testing; Time; TNF gene; Transactivation; Transforming Growth Factors; Transplantation; tumor; Tumor Antigens; tumor growth; Tumor Necrosis Factor Activation; tumorigenesis; ultraviolet; Ultraviolet Rays; UV induced; UV Radiation Exposure; UVB induced; Veterans; X-Ray Therapy; ","Regulation of cutaneous immune function and anti-tumor immune responses by PPARgamma-mediated transrepressive signaling","003762","IMMA","Immunology A ","","A1","01","","","",""

Thus far, there is no cure for MS. Studying this chronic disease of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves is challenging, because the disease changes over time. It often becomes progressive, a stage of MS for which there are no good treatments. A major impediment to a better understanding of MS is that investigators rarely obtain tissue samples for study, because to perform biopsies of the brain or spinal cord has potential to cause harm. This Program Project brings together 12 investigators in a research design comprised of three Projects and supported by three Cores to address several current needs in the field of MS.

Our project will determine how SSIM develops, and the relevance to public health is that this understanding is essential to devise new medical treatments to prevent Barrett's esophagus from forming, and to prevent the development of cancer in Barrett's esophagus.","1968094 (contact); 7063651; ","SOUZA, RHONDA F (contact); SPECHLER, STUART JON;","HAMILTON, FRANK A","09/23/2015","08/31/2020","","Reflux-Induced Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Benign Barrett's Esophagus","103598","CIMG","Clinical, Integrative and Molecular Gastroenterology Study Section ","","","03","155747","94118","249865",""

Current vaccine strategies will not prevent this type of congenital infection and in almost every part of the world, including the US, infected infants born to immune mothers represent the largest contribution to the overall disease burden of this infection.

Additionally, we show that gain of function mutations in a potassium channel are required for patterned growth effects of PI3K. We investigate the role of PI3K and potassium channel signaling in regulating the growth and patterning of limbs and the sufficiency of their signaling to regulate size.

The primary cause of death is right heart failure, yet right heart failure remains poorly understood and without specific therapies. Recent work by our group and others has demonstrated that intracellular lipid accumulation and decreased fatty acid oxidation are features of right heart failure related to pulmonary hypertension. This grant aims to demonstrate that lipid deposition in the right ventricle promotes failure and can be reversed by metabolic interventions. The long-term goal of these studies is to develop effective metabolic therapy for right heart failure in human pulmonary arterial hypertension.","8157667; ","HEMNES, ANNA R;","XIAO, LEI ","01/01/2015","12/31/2019","Affect; Animal Model; Apoptosis; Autopsy; base; bone morphogenic protein; Cardiac; Cardiac Myocytes; Cardiomyopathies; Cause of Death; CD36 Antigens; CD36 gene; Cell Culture Techniques; Ceramides; Data; Deposition; Diagnosis; Diet; Disease Marker; DNA Sequence Alteration; embryonic stem cell; Enhancers; Excision; Failure; Fatty acid glycerol esters; fatty acid oxidation; fatty acid transport; Fatty Acids; FDA approved; Financial compensation; Functional disorder; Goals; Grant; Health; Heart failure; hemodynamics; Human; human disease; Impairment; improved; Insulin Resistance; Intervention; Intracellular Accumulation of Lipids; lipid metabolism; lipid transport; Lipids; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Measures; Mediating; Metabolic; Metabolism; Metformin; Modeling; mortality; mouse model; Mus; Muscle Cells; mutant; Mutant Strains Mice; Mutation; Myocardial; Myocardial dysfunction; Myocardium; Oils; Patients; promoter; pulmonary arterial hypertension; Pulmonary artery structure; Pulmonary Hypertension; receptor; Regulator Genes; response; Right Ventricular Dysfunction; Right Ventricular Function; Right Ventricular Hypertrophy; Right ventricular structure; Rodent Model; Staining method; Stains; Stress; Technology; Testing; thermozymocidin; Tissues; tool; Transgenic Organisms; Translating; Triglycerides; Ventricular; Ventricular Ejection Fractions; western diet; Wild Type Mouse; Work; ","Lipid Deposition in the Right Ventricle in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension","122417","RIBT","Respiratory Integrative Biology and Translational Research Study Section ","","S1","04","100000","58000","158000",""
