A multilevel approach stressing prevention-care links in the Continuum of Prevention and Care (CPC), is likely to reduce barriers to HIV prevention through integrated activities involving both community-based and healthcare organizations, while creating synergy across the intervention elements. We have developed and piloted Proyecto Orgullo (PO), a multilevel, theory-based intervention that diffuses support for and creates positive social norms around HIV prevention by building a mobilized, empowered MSM/TW community to reduce unsafe sex and promote biannual HIV testing, which has shown to be acceptable, feasible and potentially effective. In collaboration with the Peruvian Ministry o Health (MoH) and local healthcare facilities, we now propose to develop, implement and test the efficacy of PO+, an extension of PO that will facilitate full engagement in the CPC, and strengthen the linkage between the community and the healthcare system. If shown effective, PO+ can be scaled up throughout Peru with the support of the MoH, and used as a model elsewhere in the Americas, including the US.","8735610; 1893413 (contact); ","CACERES, CARLOS F.; KEGELES, SUSAN M.

Although many chronically hypotensive individuals with SCI remain overtly asymptomatic, we have reported evidence of impaired memory and reduced attention and processing speed in a hypotensive SCI cohort compared to a normotensive SCI cohort. Increase in systemic blood pressure (BP), secondary to administration of an anti-hypotensive agent (midodrine), has been shown to increase cerebral blood flow (CBF) at rest and in response to cognitive testing, which was associated with improved test performance in hypotensive controls. In a relatively small group of hypotensive individuals with SCI we have demonstrated that midodrine significantly increases BP and CBF, which may improve cognitive function.

Child mental health has been identified as a priority within the WHO's Eastern Mediterranean Region (WHO EMRO). Following consultations with international and regional experts and stakeholders, WHO EMRO developed an evidence-based manualised School Mental Health Intervention (EMRO SMHI), endorsed by all member countries, including Pakistan, where the federal and provincial health departments have made plans for phased national implementation at scale. A number of implementation challenges identified by stakeholders at a WHO EMRO consultation have to be addressed to achieve these plans, including sustainable delivery of quality training and supervision at scale; routine monitoring of outcomes; mechanisms for ensuring programme quality; and intervention adaptation for delivery in diverse regional settings. We will conduct research in Pakistan embedded within national implementation of the EMRO SMHI to address these challenges, applying scalable technological and social innovations developed and feasibility-tested in Pakistan. This builds upon many years' experience of successfully delivering similar programs in resource- poor and challenging community-based settings in this region of Pakistan. Network aims: This application aims to address school-based child mental health in the EMRO region by 1. Developing a collaborative network of institutions, researchers, policy partners and community stakeholders engaged in implementing child mental health with a focus upon the EMRO SMHI.  2. Build the network's capacity in implementation research to scale-up EMRO SMHI and other child mental health programs in their countries.  3. Conduct implementation research to scale-up EMRO SMHI in Pakistan, learning from which will be  synergised to capacity building to translate research outputs to Iran, Jordan, and Egypt. Administrative core: To address these aims we will build upon a unique partnership of embedded regional policy bodies and national policy makers, researchers, and community-based NGO's. This regional network will work collaboratively with three international academic organisations providing technical expertise and support. The administrative core will be based in Pakistan at the WCC-IoP for Mental Health Research and Training, Rawalpindi (WCC-IoP). The WCC-IoP are ideally placed for this function, occupying a strategic policy development and implementation role, promoting the integration of research into policy through collaboration with government ministries, and with broad capacity building responsibilities. Capacity building: Capacity building will be embedded within the project with focus on child mental health. This will involve strengthening the capacity of targeted cohorts of researchers and policy makers in 4 EMRO countries (Pakistan, Iran, Jordan, and Egypt) to: 1) Develop skills in generating, applying and effectively disseminating research to aid implementation of  school-based interventions for child mental health; and 2) To understand, interpret and apply science-based methods and information to develop child mental  health policies and plans; 3) Use their skills to build the child mental health research and policy capacity of their countries and the  region as a whole. Scale-up research: The research component, consisting of two stages, will be embedded within Pakistan's phased scale-up implementation of the school mental health program. Research will be conducted in Pakistan, in sites with an established research infrastructure, sub-districts Kallar Syedan and Gujar Khan, in the Province of Punjab. The research team will partner with the Pakistan Health Ministry and the WCC-IoP to both study and assist its scale-up plans by integrating our technological and social innovation. We will begin our work by engaging stakeholders to develop a roadmap to both guide scale-up and evaluate various approaches to intervention training, supervision and delivery. In the next stage the research team will work with the WCC-IoP to conduct an evaluation of two methods of implementing the intervention. Using different research methods, we will compare conventional training, supervision, service delivery and program monitoring with the use of a tablet-based technology-assisted platform that integrates these essential functions. We predict that use of the platform will lead to improvements in both clinical and implementation outcomes. We anticipate that the findings will lead to improved programs that can be delivered to many children across the region and the world.","9462056 (contact); 6256417; ","RAHMAN, ATIF  (contact); WISSOW, LAWRENCE S.;","AMARREH, ISHMAEL G","09/01/2016","08/31/2021","Address; Affect; Applied Research; base; Child; Child Mental Health; Clinical; cohort; Collaborations; Communities; Consultations; Country; Educational Intervention; Effectiveness; Egypt; Ensure; Evaluation; evidence base; experience; Family; Government; Health; Health Planning; Health Policy; Hybrids; implementation research; improved; innovation; Institution; Instruction; International; Intervention; Iran; Jordan; Knowledge; Lead; Learning; Mediterranean Region; member; Mental Health; Methods; Monitor; Outcome; Output; Pakistan; Phase; Policies; Policy Developments; Policy Maker; Policy Research; Process; programs; Province; Research; Research Infrastructure; Research Methodology; Research Personnel; Research Training; Resources; Role; scale up; Schools; Services; Site; skills; social; Staging; Structure; Supervision; Tablets; teacher; Technical Expertise; Technology; Testing; Theory of Change; Training; Translating; Work; ","Eastern Mediterranean Partnership to implement the Regional Framework for Mental Health: Going to scale with school mental health","109998","ZMH1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","528250","40727","568977",""

Thus, costs for systems based on liquid helium are expected to increase, with potential negative impact on MRI availability, or machine and thus cost-per scan. This proposed program aims to develop essential technology to permit systems which can operate with much lower amounts of helium using a cryocooling method. This will also enable new MRI applications not constrained by the designs requiring liquid cryogen cooling, thus opening up new treatment possibilities. In order to do this, improvements in conductor, magnet design, and wire joints are needed.

The objectives of the CvDC are to generate and disseminate comprehensive data about molecular networks and pathways that regulate cardiovascular development. Objectives of the PCGC are to identify genetic causes of human congenital heart disease and to relate genetic variants present in the congenital heart disease patient population to clinical outcomes. The Administrative Coordinating Center (ACC) provides the infrastructure to enhance collaborations among the consortia and the NHLBI Pediatric Heart Network to identify and facilitate the translational research process for the most important pediatric cardiovascular clinical care problems. Our proposed ACC to support the CvDC and PCGC is a unique, integrated combination of world-leading pediatric cardiovascular and neurocognitive clinical/translational research expertise, advanced infrastructure, outstanding institutional support, and state-of- the-art technology.

Obesity causes poor health outcomes such as type 2 diabetes, heart attacks, and early death. Most people who try to lose weight are unable to do so. When obese people eat food they have less response in areas of the brain that sense pleasure (reward) as compared to non-obese people. Decreased pleasure response to food predicts future weight gain. It is not known if this poor brain response is reversible or why obese people's brains respond this way. Insulin in the brain regulates the brain's pleasure sense. As people gain weight, the function of insulin becomes impaired. We will study if impaired function of insulin is related to a poor brain response to food and if this brain response predicts food intake and change in weight. We will, also, study if improving the function of insulin with weight loss improves the brain response. These studies will improve the understanding as to why weight loss is difficult and if improving insulin signaling is a potential way to treat obesity.","9422904; ","DUNN, JULIA PASSYN;","","01/01/2015","12/31/2019","Activation Analysis; addiction; Age; Animals; Area; Award; base; Binge Eating; Blood; Body mass index; Body Weight; Body Weight Changes; Body Weight decreased; Brain; Brain region; career; career development; Caring; Cessation of life; Characteristics; Clinical; Clinical Investigator; Clinical Research; Collaborations; Corpus striatum structure; Data; design; Development Plans; Dopamine; dopaminergic neuron; Dorsal; Drug Addiction; Eating; Eating Behavior; Energy Intake; Enrollment; Environment; Euglycemic Clamping; Exposure to; Food; food consumption; Frequencies; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Future; Gender; Glucose Clamp; glucose metabolism; Goals; Gold; Health; health administration; Hormones; Human; Hyperphagia; Image; improved; improved functioning; in vivo; Individual; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; insulin sensitivity; insulin signaling; Intervention; Intervention Trial; K-Series Research Career Programs; Measurement; Measures; Medical; Mentorship; metabolomics; Midbrain structure; MRI Scans; Myocardial Infarction; neuroimaging; Neurosciences; Neurosecretory Systems; new therapeutic target; Non obese; Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; Obesity; obesogenic; Outcome; Outcome Assessment; Outcomes Research; Oxygen; Participant; Pathway interactions; Patients; Personality Character; Phenotype; pleasure; Population; pre-clinical; preclinical study; predicting response; prevent; programs; prospective; Psychometrics; Randomized; relating to nervous system; Reporting; Research Proposals; Resources; response; responsible research conduct; Rewards; Rodent; Signal Transduction; skills; success; Techniques; Testing; Time; tool; Training; Training Activity; Veterans; Weight; Weight Gain; weight loss intervention; Work; ","Insulin Resistance and Reward Signaling in Obesity","000943","CLNB","Clinical Trials - B ","","","03","","","",""

The long-term goal of this project is to shed light into these processes by studying the biological function of normal and mutated proteins in FHL subjects and thus help in therapeutic decisions for patients with primary immunodeficiency as well as aid in the development of targeted approaches to improve the killing pathways against tumors an viral infections.","11112403; ","GIRAUDO, CLAUDIO GUILLERMO;","VOULGAROPOULOU, FROSSO ","01/25/2017","12/31/2021","Affect; Affinity; base; Binding; Binding Proteins; Biochemical; Biological; Biological Assay; Biological Process; cell killing; Cell membrane; Cell physiology; Cell Proliferation; Cell-Mediated Cytolysis; Cells; Chimeric Proteins; Chronic Childhood Arthritis; Clinical; Complex; congenital immunodeficiency; controlled release; Cytoplasmic Granules; cytotoxic; Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes; cytotoxicity; Data; Defect; Development; Diagnostic; Diagnostic tests; Disease; domain mapping; Dominant-Negative Mutation; Endosomes; Environment; Event; Exocytosis; Genes; Genetic; Germ-Line Mutation; Goals; Health; Hereditary Disease; Image; Immune; Immune response; Immune System Diseases; immunological synapse; improved; In Vitro; induced pluripotent stem cell; Inflammation; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; insight; Intracellular Membranes; Janus kinase; Killings; Knowledge; Lead; Life; Light; Link; Liposomes; Lysosomes; Lytic; macrophage; Macrophage Activation; Measures; Mediating; Membrane Fusion; Membrane Protein Traffic; Microscopy; Molecular Mechanisms of Action; Mus; mutant; Mutate; Mutation; neoplastic cell; Normal Cell; novel; novel diagnostics; Pathway interactions; Patients; Phenotype; Process; protein function; protein protein interaction; Proteins; Proteomics; research study; Resolution; Role; Sampling; Signal Transduction; Signaling Protein; SNAP23 gene; Surface Plasmon Resonance; Symptoms; Syndrome; syntaxin 11; syntaxin 4; T-Lymphocyte and Natural Killer Cell; Techniques; Testing; Therapeutic; TNF gene; tool; Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent; trafficking; Transmembrane Transport; tumor; Virus Diseases; ","Role of Stx11 and STXBP2 in lytic granule exocytosis in health and disease","123538","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","01","259381","176379","435760",""

Insulin resistance is a key factor in the etiology of these diseases, and it is commonly heralded by a rise in plasma insulin levels, or hyperinsulinemia. This proposal seeks to determine the cause- effect relationship between insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. In the current funding period, we have pioneered the biochemical, physiological, and genetic identification of CEACAM1 as a key regulator of hepatic insulin clearance and plasma insulin levels. We have shown that disturbance of this pathway causes hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. We now aim to test the hypothesis that reduction in hepatic CEACAM1 constitutes an early, and fully preventable mechanism of diet-induced insulin resistance. To this end, we will use cellular and transgenic animal studies. The combined results of these experiments should provide a critical test of the idea that hyperinsulinemia can be a cause of insulin resistance, as opposed to an early consequence thereof, and identify CEACAM1 as a tractable drug target for the development of medications to combat this metabolic condition.

The impact of this work is high, since a positive result will both alter the management of all women known to have anti-Ro antibodies as well as justify testing all women for these antibodies, even if they are asymptomatic, as part of an early pregnancy screen.","1877754; ","BUYON, JILL PAMELA;","ZAJICEK, ANNE ","01/01/2015","12/31/2019","Address; Adult; Affect; Age; Anatomy; Antibodies; Attention; Autoantibodies; base; Basic Science; bench to bedside; Biological Markers; Birth; Bradycardia; Cardiac; cardiac pacing; Case-Control Studies; Child; Chloroquine; Clinical; Complex; Conceptions; Congenital Heart Block; coronary fibrosis; Counseling; Data; Defect; design; Development; Disease; disorder risk; Dose; Echocardiography; Endocardium; Enrollment; Evaluable Disease; Evaluation; Exanthema; Face; fetal; Fetus; Gestational Age; Goals; Health; Health Status; Heart Block; Heart Diseases; Historical Cohort Studies; Hydroxychloroquine; Immunoglobulin G; in utero; In Vitro; Injury; Interferon-alpha; Interferons; Intervention; Intravenous Immunoglobulins; Life; Ligation; macrophage; Maternal Health; Measures; Mediating; Metabolism; Monitor; mortality; Mothers; Multicenter Studies; Myocardial; Myocardium; Names; Neonatal lupus erythematosus; neonatal morbidity; Neurons; offspring; open label; Optical Coherence Tomography; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; phase II trial; Plasmapheresis; Pregnancy; Pregnant Women; prevent; Prevention; Preventive; Preventive therapy; Prophylactic treatment; prospective; Prospective Studies; Proteins; Protocols documentation; Race; Randomized; Randomized Controlled Trials; Rare Diseases; Receptor Signaling; Recruitment Activity; Recurrence; Registries; Reporting; Research; Research Personnel; Resources; Retina; Retinal; retinal neuron; Rheumatism; Ribonucleoproteins; Risk; Role; Safety; screening; SS-A antibodies; Staging; Steroids; Survivors; Sympathomimetics; Systemic Lupus Erythematosus; Testing; Time; Tissues; Toll-like receptors; Toxic effect; Translating; Translational Research; Treatment Efficacy; treatment strategy; Umbilical Cord Blood; Vision; Woman; Work; ","Preventive Approach to Congenital Heart Block with Hydroxychloroquine (PATCH)","079951","PN","Pregnancy and Neonatology Study Section ","","","03","155509","92304","247813",""

However, there is no approved medication available to treat this precancerous disease. Clinical trials have shown that COXIBs (selective COX-2 inhibitors), originally developed for treating arthritis, are highly effective in reducing the risk of colon cancer in FAP patients. However, this class of drug cannot be used to treat FAP due to their severe side effects, including unstable angina, myocardial infarction, and cardiac thrombus. Drug companies have had to withdraw the indication for FAP of the approved COXIBs (i.e., celecoxib) from the market due to these severe side effects in the cardiovascular system, leaving thousands of patients who are at high risk of developing colorectal cancer without a safe and effective treatment. We propose to develop recycled colon bioavailable (r- CB) drugs that are only bioavailable in the colon by targeting enterohepatic circulation (EHC) via structure modification of current marketed COX-2 inhibitors, thereby reducing the systemic side effects associated with broad distribution of the drugs without sacrificing their efficacy. In the preliminary study, we have synthesized a few compounds and identified a highly active COX-2 inhibitor (GS1) that undergoes efficient EHC, resulting in low systemic exposure and high colonic exposure. In this application, we propose to evaluate the chemopreventive efficacy of GS1 in the colon using an animal model relevant to FAP. We will also investigate the mechanism of EHC and evaluate the impact of EHC on colonic drug distribution. If the concept proves successful, novel drug candidates are expected to emerge for a safer form of colorectal cancer prevention in FAP patients.","10960383; ","GAO, SONG ;","PERLOFF, MARJORIE ","01/26/2017","12/31/2018","ABCG2 gene; absorption; abstracting; Address; Adenomatous Polyposis Coli; Adverse effects; Affect; Affinity; Age; Animal Model; Animals; Anti-inflammatory; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Arthritis; Aspirin; base; Bile fluid; Biliary; Bioavailable; Biological Availability; Caco-2 Cells; Cannulations; Cardiac; Cardiovascular system; celecoxib; Cell Culture Techniques; Chemoprevention; Chemopreventive Agent; Chronic Disease; Clinical Trials; Colon; colon carcinogenesis; Colon Carcinoma; Colonic Adenoma; Colonic Diseases; Colorectal; Colorectal Cancer; colorectal cancer prevention; Colorectal Polyp; Communities; Coxibs; cyclooxygenase 2; Data; design; Development; Disease; Dose; drug candidate; Drug Design; drug distribution; Drug Exposure; Drug Kinetics; effective therapy; Endoscopy; Enterohepatic Circulation; experience; Future; Glucuronides; Goals; Hepatic; high risk; Hydrolysis; in vivo; Incidence; Inherited; Intestines; Kidney; Left; Life; Liver; Lung; malignant colon tumor; Malignant Neoplasms; Marketing; Mediating; Metabolic; Metabolism; Modeling; Modification; Myocardial Infarction; Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents; novel; novel therapeutics; Organ; Patients; Perfusion; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacotherapy; polyposis; Predisposition; Premalignant; Preparation; prevent; Prevention; Process; Publishing; Rattus; Rectal Cancer; Recycling; Reporting; Research; Risk; Rofecoxib; Small Intestines; Structure; Structure-Activity Relationship; Sulindac; Syndrome; Testing; Thrombus; United States National Institutes of Health; Unstable angina; Withdrawal; ","Developing Recycled Colon Bioavailable (r-CB) COXIBs for the Treatment of Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)","212937","ZCA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","50000","25667","75667",""

In addition to being common, the problem of menthol cigarette usage among Veterans is likely to increase over time, because military deployment increases the chances of smoking initiation and because marketing of menthol cigarettes is currently aimed at roughly the age group that comprises the active military. A central difficulty with menthol cigarettes is that smokers who use them have lower cessation rates in standardized treatment programs than smokers who use non-menthol cigarettes. For the proposed study, brain imaging will be used to determine 1422* nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) densities in menthol and non-menthol Veteran cigarette smokers, along with the effects of quitting smoking on these receptor densities. Results of the proposed research may have implications for improving treatments for menthol (and non- menthol) cigarette smoking Veterans.","8048190; ","BRODY, ARTHUR ;","","01/01/2013","12/31/2017","Abstinence; addiction; Adult; Affect; Affinity; Aftercare; age group; Applications Grants; base; Behavioral; Binding; Biological Markers; Bolus Infusion; Brain; Brain imaging; Brain region; Carbon Monoxide; Cigarette; Cigarette Smoker; cigarette smoking; Clinical; Cognitive; contingency management; Continuous Infusion; Cotinine; craving; Data; Data Analyses; density; Dose; Exhalation; follow-up; Funding; Future; Group Psychotherapy; Health; Human; hydroxycotinine; improved; interest; Literature; Los Angeles; Marketing; Measures; Mediating; member; Mental Depression; Menthol; Metabolism; Methods; Military Personnel; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; MRI Scans; negative affect; Nicotine; Nicotine Dependence; nicotine patch; Nicotinic Receptors; Non-smoker; non-smoking; Outcome; Participant; Persons; Pilot Projects; Plasma; Population; Positron-Emission Tomography; Predictive Value; Prevalence; Procedures; programs; Protocols documentation; pyridine; radiotracer; receptor density; Receptor Up-Regulation; Recruitment Activity; Reporting; Research; response; Satiation; screening; Serum; Severities; Smoke; Smoker; Smoking; smoking cessation; Smoking Status; Specificity; standard care; Symptoms; Telephone; Testing; Thalamic structure; Time; tobacco control; Tobacco Dependence; treatment duration; Treatment outcome; treatment program; Up-Regulation; Urine; Veterans; Withholding Treatment; ","Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Density and Veteran Cigarette Smokers","000412","NURA","Neurobiology A ","","","05","","","",""

As such, it is not surprising that blood flow is a very powerful indicator of tissue health and its activity. Indeed, recent evidence suggests that poor regulation of cerebral blood flow is closely linked to the development of several diseases whose prevalence is on the rise, like multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. Thus, there is a clear need for tools to image blood flow and other related parameters non-invasively. Such a method could be a powerful biomarker for early diagnosis and for assessing treatment efficacy in these and other diseases. It would also be a very powerful technique for researchers investigating brain function. In that regard, arterial spin labeling (ASL) is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique to image perfusion without injection of contrast agents. Instead of contrast agents, ASL uses radiofrequency waves to create a tracer by magnetically labeling the blood itself. ASL is rapidly gaining prominence in the clinic because perfusion can yield crucial information about the health of brain tissue and its vasculature, and it is being adopted to image other organs as well with increasing frequency. ASL could also be an invaluable tool to study cognitive function, psychiatric disorders and their treatment. Unfortunately, while ASL's potential as a clinical and research tool is phenomenal, the technique is not easy to implement and is still severely challenged by poor image quality (i.e., low signal to noise ratio - SNR) and resolution, particularly in the brain's white matter. Given that reliable ASL imaging of the white matter is very desirable as a biomarker for white matter diseases, this proposal seeks to tackle these challenges by developing a new strategy for ASL imaging. Success in this proposal will translate into a new robust perfusion imaging technique that can be made readily available in most clinical and research MRI scanners. The new technique will permit physicians and scientists to obtain quantitative images of multiple vascular parameters, such as blood flow and blood volume. These quantitative images will provide fundamental data to diagnose and characterize the disease early in the process, as well as to determine treatment efficacy.","7681363; ","HERNANDEZ-GARCIA, LUIS ;","LIU, GUOYING ","03/01/2016","12/31/2017","Adopted; Agreement; Alzheimer's Disease; base; Biological Markers; Blood; Blood flow; Blood Vessels; Blood Volume; Bolus Infusion; Brain; brain tissue; cerebral hemodynamics; Cerebrovascular Circulation; Clinic; Clinical; Clinical Research; cognitive function; Communities; Computer software; Contrast Media; Data; Development; Diagnosis; Dictionary; Disease; Early Diagnosis; Equation; Face; Fingerprint; Frequencies; Gadolinium; gadolinium oxide; Genetic Programming; Health; hemodynamics; Human Volunteers; Image; Imaging Techniques; Injection of therapeutic agent; Label; Link; Magnetic Resonance; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Malignant Neoplasms; Maps; Measurement; Measures; Mental disorders; Metabolic; Methods; Morphologic artifacts; Multiple Sclerosis; Noise; non-invasive imaging; Organ; Perfusion; Physicians; Physiologic pulse; Population; Positron-Emission Tomography; Prevalence; Process; Protocols documentation; quantitative imaging; Radioactive; radiofrequency; Regulation; Reproducibility; Research Personnel; Resolution; Risk; Scanning; Scheme; Scientist; Signal Transduction; Site; Speed; Spin Labels; Staging; stroke; success; Techniques; Time; Tissues; tool; Toxic effect; Tracer; Translating; Treatment Efficacy; Validation; validation studies; Water; white matter; White Matter Disease; ","Quantitative Blood Flow Imaging using Spin Labeled MR Fingerprinting","021562","MEDI","Medical Imaging Study Section ","","","02","112500","56136","168636",""

Using a novel NMR spectroscopy tool developed in the Wand laboratory, the ?conformational entropy meter,? we will experimentally quantitate the energetic contribution from conformational entropy.

However, the kidney has many other non-glomerular functions. Kidney biopsy studies demonstrate that the degree of kidney tubular atrophy and fibrosis are extremely potent prognostic factors not captured by glomerular markers. This study will be conducted within a large multi-center randomized blood pressure trial with long-term follow-up and adjudicated CKD and CVD events. We propose to make non-invasive measurements of kidney tubular function and injury, and to test whether they inform prognosis of CVD events and CKD progression independent of eGFR and albuminuria.

Heart disease risk is caused by inherited (ie family history) and environmental factors. The most powerful environmental determinant of cardiovascular disease risk is the diet. Unhealthy diets promote obesity and dramatically increase cardiovascular disease risk in men and women because obese individuals and particularly those with diabetes have persistently high levels of ?bad? lipids in their blood called low density lipoproteins. These are formed directly from fats and lipids that are ingested in the diet and can also be produced by the liver. Accumulation of these bad lipids in the walls of blood vessels in the heart causes angina and heart attacks. We have identified a particular component of these bad lipids that can increase these heart disease processes and may be a link between heritable and diet dependent heart disease risk. We will study where this particular bad lipid comes from in the body. Our studies might lead to new ways to prevent, diagnose or treat heart disease in Veterans.","1879477; ","MORRIS, ANDREW J;","","01/01/2013","12/31/2020","Adipocytes; Adipose tissue; Apolipoproteins B; Arterial Fatty Streak; Atherosclerosis; Attention; Award; base; Biological Markers; Blood; Blood Circulation; Blood Vessels; Cardiovascular Diseases; cardiovascular disorder risk; Cardiovascular system; Caring; cell motility; Cell surface; cell type; Cells; Cholesterol; Chylomicrons; Coronary Arteriosclerosis; Coronary artery; Coupled; Data; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; Diagnosis; Diet; Dietary Fats; Dietary Intervention; Dietary Phospholipid; Disease; Disease Progression; disorder risk; Enterocytes; Environmental Risk Factor; Enzymes; Extravasation; Family; Fasting; Fatty acid glycerol esters; feeding; Foam Cells; Funding; Gene Expression; General Population; Generations; Genes; Genetic; Goals; Heart; heart disease risk; Heart Diseases; Hepatic; Human; Image; In Vitro; Incidence; Individual; Inflammation; Inherited; insight; Intestines; Introns; Investigation; Lead; Life Style; Link; lipid mediator; lipid phosphate phosphatase; Lipids; Lipoproteins; Liver; low density lipoprotein inhibitor; Low-Density Lipoproteins; lysophosphatidic acid; Lysophospholipase; Lysophospholipids; macrophage; Mass Spectrum Analysis; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; Membrane; men; Metabolic; Metabolism; Methods; monocyte; mortality; mouse model; Mus; Myocardial Infarction; Myocardial Ischemia; novel therapeutics; nutrition; Obesity; Overweight; oxidized low density lipoprotein; particle; Permeability; Phenotype; Phospholipids; Plasma; Platelet Activation; prevent; Prevention; Process; protective effect; Protein Dephosphorylation; Recording of previous events; Research; response; Risk Factors; Rupture; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Smooth Muscle Myocytes; Source; Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization; stable isotope; Suppressor Genes; Testing; Thrombosis; Tissues; Tracer; Triglycerides; United States; Variant; vascular endothelium permeability; vascular inflammation; Vascular Smooth Muscle; vascular smooth muscle cell migration; Very low density lipoprotein; Veterans; Weight; Woman; ","Lysophosphatidic acid and cardiovascular disease risk","001550","CARB","Cardiovascular Studies B ","","","05","","","",""

OSA is a common problem that has been linked to many health problems, including high blood pressure, diabetes, memory problems and heart attacks. OSA occurs because the upper airway collapses repeatedly during sleep, so airflow into the lungs is significantly reduced or even blocked and oxygen levels in the blood fall. This results in a state of periodically low oxygen levels in the blood known as hypoxia. Many essential processes, such as production of red blood cells, energy regulation, cancer, blood pressure, and formation of new blood vessels, are controlled by hypoxia. The frequency of OSA among veterans and others in the U.S. is reaching epidemic proportions. In this research, we want to find out the blood changes with OSA and define how they affect our health. This could lead to new treatments for OSA and a resulting decrease in hypertension, diabetes, and heart attacks.","1881539; ","PRCHAL, JOSEF T;","","01/01/2017","12/31/2020","Accounting; Adult; Affect; Apnea; Attenuated; B-Lymphocytes; base; bHLH-PAS factor HLF; Blood; Blood Cells; Blood Platelets; Blood Pressure; Blood Vessels; BNIP3L gene; body sense; Breathing; Carbon Monoxide; Carotid Body; catalase; catalase-polyethylene glycol; Cells; Chicago; Chronic; Clinical; Collaborations; Continuous Positive Airway Pressure; Cor pulmonale; cost; Cystathionine; Data; design; Diabetes Mellitus; Diffuse; Disease; Down-Regulation; Emergency department visit; Epidemic; Erythrocytes; Erythrocytoses; Erythroid; Erythropoiesis; Erythropoietin; Excision; Exhalation; falls; Frequencies; Functional disorder; Generations; Genes; Glucose Intolerance; Goals; granulocyte; Health; Healthcare Systems; Hematocrit procedure; heme oxygenase-2; Hemolysis; Hormones; Hospitalization; Hydrogen Sulfide; Hypertension; Hypoxemia; Hypoxia; Hypoxia Inducible Factor; hypoxia inducible factor 1; Impaired cognition; indexing; Inflammation; insight; Lead; Link; Lung; Lyase; Malignant Neoplasms; Measures; Mediating; Medical; Medicine; Memory; Messenger RNA; Metabolic; metabolome; MicroRNAs; Mitochondria; Modeling; Molecular; monocyte; Mononuclear; Morbidity - disease rate; mouse model; Myocardial Infarction; neurotransmission; novel; Obesity; Obstructive Sleep Apnea; Oxygen; Pathway interactions; Patients; Persons; Plasma; Play; Polycythemia; Population; prevent; Process; Production; professor; progenitor; Prospective Studies; Pulmonology; pyruvate kinase deficiency; Reactive Oxygen Species; Recurrence; Reflex action; Reflex control; Regulation; Research; Research Proposals; Reticulocytes; Role; Secondary to; sensor; Severities; Sleep; Sleep Apnea Syndromes; T-Lymphocyte; Testing; Tissues; Transcript; transcription factor; Universities; Up-Regulation; urgent care; Utah; Veterans; Visit; ","HIF-Mediated Detrimental Consequences of Chronic Intermittent Hypoxia","001372","HEMA","Hematology ","","A2","01","","","",""

Lack of either one of them rapidly leads to failure of neuronal function. The regulation of brain energy metabolism is accomplished via the constant communication between astrocytes and neurons. Furthermore, the role of astrocytes in stroke and neurodegenerative processes is also becoming increasingly appreciated. Many of these neurological diseases have been implicated to be due to dysregulation of autophagy and energy metabolism. Model organism studies have shown that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) function is critical for neuronal maintenance. Lack of AMPK function results in progressive neurodegeneration, which has implications for many neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer?s and Parkinson?s. Additionally, Ghrelin, an AMPK activator, has also been shown to play a role in various neurodegenerative processes, including AD, and Parkinson?s. Furthermore, Metformin is a widely used Type 2 diabetes drug shown to have its therapeutic effects through the activation of AMPK. Furthermore, rapamycin has been shown to be a potential therapeutic modulator for many neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer?s, Parkinson?s, and Huntington?s.","14584389; ","WILLIAMS, TYISHA ;","GUBITZ, AMELIE ","08/16/2016","06/30/2018","","Genetic Analysis of AMPK-alpha in Astrocytes during Normal and Energetic Stress","084329","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","262125","87731","349856",""
