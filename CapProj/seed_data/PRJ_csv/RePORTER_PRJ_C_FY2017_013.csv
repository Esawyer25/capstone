Most of the tumors are initially responsive to platinum-based chemotherapy, and the majority of signs and symptoms of cancer are gone. However, cancer can come back and become resistant to the drug. Indeed, 90% of the deaths from ovarian cancer are due to tumor return and drug resistance. Poor understanding of this drug resistance is a critical cancer research challenge. In this project, we plan to determine the role of cancer stem cells and their genomic instability in the tumor recurrence and the subsequent development of cisplatin resistance.

It's becoming apparent that in order to understand cancer metastasis, we need to understand early embryo development. Many of the molecular mechanisms used during early embryogenesis are resurrected by cancerous cells during tumor initiation, progression and metastasis. By inducing key embryonic genes, tumorous cells can turn on necessary biological processes to over proliferate, leave the primary site of origin, migrate long distances and grow at distant sites. One such process that plays essential roles both during embryogenesis and in the adult is the evolutionarily conserved JAK/STAT signaling. JAK/STAT signaling is involved in various biological processes including cell proliferation, immunity, cell death and cell migration,  so it is not surprising to find mutations in the components of JAK/STAT in various forms of cancer. JAK/STAT signaling is also often implicated in cancer invasion and metastasis but the precise role of this pathway during cell migration is still not well understood. Here, I propose to  investigate the role of JAK/STAT signaling during cell migration by using a zebrafish as a model, which is a powerful organism that has been used widely to understand various aspects of human disease such as cancer. The results of this proposal will significantly enhance our understanding of the role of this signaling pathway during cell migration not only during normal development but also during cancer metastasis. In addition, the findings from this study will determine the effects of the JAK/STAT signaling specifically on melanoma development, which will be informative for the development of more effective cancer therapies.","12647725; ","KUNTTAS-TATLI, EZGI ;","HENKEN, DEBORAH B.","04/01/2016","03/31/2019","Actins; Adult; Affect; Animal Model; Apoptosis; Binding; Bioinformatics; Biological Process; blastomere structure; Cancer Biology; Cancer Patient; cancer therapy; cancer type; Cancerous; Cause of Death; Cell Adhesion; Cell Death; Cell Line; cell motility; Cell Proliferation; Cells; Cessation of life; Chemicals; chemotherapeutic agent; chemotherapy; comparative; Cytoskeleton; Data; Data Set; Development; Diagnosis; Distant; Drosophila genus; effective therapy; Embryo; Embryonic Development; Employee Strikes; Extracellular Matrix; Figs - dietary; Gene Targeting; Genes; Genomics; Hand; Human; human disease; Immunity; improved; in vivo Model; In-Migration; Indium; inhibitor/antagonist; Knock-out; Left; Malignant Neoplasms; MAP Kinase Gene; Measurement; melanoma; Melanoma Cell; Methods; migration; Modeling; Molecular; Molecular Profiling; mutant; Mutation; Neoplasm Metastasis; neoplastic cell; Neural Crest; Neural Crest Cell; novel; Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences; Organism; Pathway interactions; Patients; Play; Primary Neoplasm; Process; programs; Proliferating; Proteins; public health relevance; Role; screening; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Site; Skin Cancer; Staging; STAT protein; successful intervention; System; Testing; Therapeutic Intervention; therapy development; transcriptome; tumor; tumor initiation; United States; Zebrafish; ","Role of JAK/Stat signaling during zebrafish neural crest delamination and migration","087026","","","","S1","01","316","","316",""

Currently there are no broadly effective pharmacological agents used for the treatment of tinnitus. Crucial for development and testing of pharmacological interventions is identification of a biomarker that is reliably correlated with the perception of tinnitus. Since changes in neuronal activity in the inferior colliculus (IC) has often been correlated with the perception of tinnitus e propose that monitoring neuronal activity in IC neurons may provide a useful biomarker for the diagnosis of tinnitus. Our most recent data suggest that voltage gated calcium channel blockers may prove effective in the attenuation of tinnitus perception. Therefore we propose that increased neuronal activity in the IC is an indicator of tinnitus perception and that decreases in the perception of tinnitus and spontaneous neuronal activity can be used as a metrics for evaluation of drugs proposed for pharmacological intervention.","1921919; ","HOLT, AVRIL GENENE ;","","11/01/2013","10/31/2017","Acoustic Trauma; Acoustics; Affect; Animal Model; Animals; arm; Attenuated; attenuation; Auditory; Auditory Brainstem Responses; base; Biological Markers; Budgets; Calcium Channel; Calcium Channel Blockers; combat; Data; Development; Diagnosis; diagnosis evaluation; diagnostic biomarker; differential expression; disability; Disease; Dorsal; drug efficacy; Drug Evaluation; Drug Targeting; efficacy testing; Electrophysiology (science); Evaluation; Exhibits; experience; Exposure to; Fire - disasters; Future; Generations; Genes; Goals; Health; Hearing; hearing impairment; Helicopter; high risk; Human; Image; Individual; Inferior Colliculus; Intervention; Lead; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Manganese; Measures; Methods; Military Personnel; Modeling; Monitor; Neurons; Noise; novel; Pathology; Patients; Perception; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Population; prevent; Prevention; Rattus; Reflex action; Reporting; Research; research study; restoration; Services; Signal Transduction; sound; Source; specific biomarkers; Sprague-Dawley Rats; Stimulus; Temporary Threshold Shift; Testing; Therapeutic Intervention; Tinnitus; Training; United States; Veterans; voltage; War; weapons; ","Development of Effective Strategies for Tinnitus Diagnosis and Treatment","001095","RRD3","Sensory Systems/Communication Disorders ","","","04","","","",""

Such studies could lead to the earlier identification of children who will later develop depression and inform new preventive treatment efforts aimed at minimizing the significant burden of this important public health issue.

The successful track record of our efforts is the best demonstration of effective mentee promotion and surgical oncology carrer development , in all phases of the Program. Over the past five-year funding cycle, this program has been gender-balanced (33% women) and has included 15% under-represented minorities, thus enabling the programmatic commitment to diversity and excellence in a scientifically-balanced oncology training program focused upon Surgical Science. Importantly, the efforts to achieve retention of trainees in academic surgical oncology, its surgical disciplines and gynecological oncology has been outstanding ,with 86% continuing in university clinical and research positions .The current proposal expands and develops our infrastructure and organization, with more than a mere reformulation of past submissions; this     renewal application constitutes a fresh redesign of our program with better selection of mentors, a revised curriculum and improved evaluation and monitoring mechanisms.","1979122; ","BLAND, KIRBY I.;","PERKINS, SUSAN N","04/01/2001","06/30/2017","Research Training; Surgical Oncology; Training Programs; ","Research Training Program in Surgical Oncology","091078","NCI","Subcommittee I - Transistion to Independence ","","S1","15","4424","353","4777",""

The incidence of dizziness and imbalance increases i populations relevant to VA healthcare: older adults, individuals with traumatic brain injury, and individuals with associated psychiatric disorders.

Despite intensive efforts to understand disease pathogenesis, there are currently no FDA approved pharmacological treatments for IPF. We recently published that pathological lung mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) are a cell-of-origin for the IPF fibroblast; and that IPF extracellular matrix (ECM) reprograms fibroblast gene expression to establish a positive feedback loop that translationally activates ECM genes and their cognate cell surface receptors.

In addition to their important role in intestinal homeostasis, these Lgr5+ ISCs also serve as the cell-of-origin for most precancerous adenomatous lesions. Although significant epidemiologic and rodent studies link pro-obesity diets to colon cancer incidence, little is known about how the adaptation of ISCs and progenitors to such diets alters the potential of these cells to form tumors. In this proposal, we will interrogate how a pro-obesity high fat diet impacts intestinal stem and progenitor cell function and the cellular origins of intestinal dysplasia.","10420918; ","YILMAZ, OMER ;","ESPEY, MICHAEL G.","12/23/2016","11/30/2021","Adult; Aging; Agonist; Biological Assay; Biology; Cell physiology; cell type; Cells; Cellular biology; Colon Carcinoma; Cues; Daughter; Development; Diet; dietary control; Disease; Engineering; Enzymes; Epidemiology; fatty acid oxidation; Fatty Acids; Foundations; Genetic; Heterogeneity; High Fat Diet; in vivo; Incidence; intestinal epithelium; intestinal homeostasis; Intestinal Intraepithelial Neoplasia; Intestinal Neoplasms; Intestines; Lesion; Link; Maintenance; Malignant Neoplasms; Mammals; Maps; Mediating; Messenger RNA; Metabolic; mouse model; Mus; Natural regeneration; Obesity; Organoids; Pathway interactions; Physiology; Population; PPAR delta; Premalignant; Process; Production; progenitor; programs; Regulator Genes; research study; response; Rodent; Role; self-renewal; Signal Transduction; stem; stem cell biology; Stem cells; stemness; Testing; tissue regeneration; Transplantation; tumor; tumor initiation; Tumor Suppressor Genes; Tumor Suppressor Proteins; tumorigenesis; tumorigenic; ","Dietary control of stem cells in physiology and cancer","211184","CAMP","Cancer Molecular Pathobiology Study Section ","","","01","264697","144789","409486",""

This project will apply CRISPR/Cas9 technology to restore FOXP3 gene expression in T cells or in hematopoietic stem cells of IPEX patients.

Pancreatic cancer cells are able to proliferate rapidly, even though their environment limits access to nutrients and oxygen normally used to generate these building blocks. Thus, in their harsh environment, pancreatic cancer cells are likely to rely upon alternative metabolic pathways to generate metabolites needed for growth. Targeting these metabolic pathways may inhibit pancreatic tumor growth and have therapeutic potential. Here, we propose to identify the metabolic pathways that pancreatic cancer cells specifically require to grow in nutrient and oxygen limiting environments. This knowledge will generate new insight into cancer metabolism and potentially lead to new chemotherapeutic targets.","9849187; ","MUIR, ALEXANDER ;","MCGUIRL, MICHELE ","06/30/2016","","abstracting; Adenocarcinoma Cell; Amino Acids; Anabolism; base; Biochemical Pathway; Biomass; cancer cell; Cell Line; Cell Proliferation; Cells; Citrates; Complex; coping; CRISPR screen; CRISPR/Cas technology; Electron Transport; Environment; Enzymes; Equilibrium; fatty acid biosynthesis; Fatty acid glycerol esters; fatty acid metabolism; Fatty Acids; Gene Targeting; genome editing; Glutamine; Growth; Guide RNA; Homeostasis; Human; Hypoxia; impaired capacity; In Vitro; in vivo; insight; Knowledge; Lead; lipid biosynthesis; lipid metabolism; Malignant Neoplasms; Mass Fragmentography; Mediating; Metabolic; Metabolic Pathway; metabolic phenotype; Metabolism; Mutation; NADH; Natural regeneration; Non-Essential Amino Acid; Nucleotides; Nutrient; overexpression; Oxidants; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxygen; Pancreas; pancreatic cancer cells; Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma; pancreatic neoplasm; Pathway interactions; prevent; Production; Proliferating; Proline; Reaction; Recycling; Role; stable isotope; Testing; Therapeutic; tumor; tumor growth; tumor metabolism; Work; ","Understanding metabolic pathways that support redox homeostasis in cancer","213810","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","56694","","56694",""

The proposed studies will explore the molecular mechanisms by which ERK1/2 signaling in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), a forebrain region that contains presympathetic neurons, increases sympathetic nerve activity in heart failure, and will test a novel pharmaceutical approach to the treatment of brain ERK1/2 signaling in heart failure that may have important translational implications.","1865543; ","FELDER, ROBERT B;","LATHROP, DAVID A.","12/23/2016","11/30/2020","Address; adverse outcome; Aging; aging population; Agonist; Aldosterone; American; Angiotensin II; Arrhythmia; Attention; Automobile Driving; base; Blood - brain barrier anatomy; Brain; Brain region; Cardiac; Cardiovascular system; Cell Nucleus; chemokine; Cyclic AMP-Responsive DNA-Binding Protein; cytokine; Data; design; Development; Device or Instrument Development; Disease; Drug Delivery Systems; drug development; Endoplasmic Reticulum; Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor; Exhibits; Genetic Transcription; Glycolates; Goals; Healthcare; Heart failure; Human; improved; Inflammation; Inflammation Mediators; Inflammatory; Infusion procedures; inhibitor/antagonist; insight; interest; Interleukin-1 beta; Intervention; Ischemia; Laboratories; Lead; MAPK1 gene; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; Microinjections; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Modeling; Molecular; Myocardial Infarction; Nature; Nerve; Neuraxis; neurochemistry; neuromechanism; Neurons; NF-kappa B; Norepinephrine; novel; Nuclear; Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences; paraventricular nucleus; Pathway interactions; Patients; Peripheral; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacologic Substance; Pharmacological Treatment; Pharmacotherapy; Plasma; Population; Potassium Channel; Preparation; Prosencephalon; Rattus; relating to nervous system; Renin-Angiotensin System; Role; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Small Interfering RNA; socioeconomics; Source; Specificity; Stromal Cell-Derived Factor 1; Subcutaneous Injections; Sympathetic Nervous System; Systolic heart failure; targeted treatment; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Intervention; Therapeutic Studies; TNF gene; transcription factor; Transcription Factor AP-1; Up-Regulation; Work; ","Brain ERK1/2 Signaling and Sympathetic Excitation in Heart Failure","136149","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","412283","162936","575219",""

We can now manufacture NK cells from cord blood in our laboratory to sufficient numbers and quality for use in cancer patients, placing us in an ideal position to begin clinical trials of this immunotherapy in patients with AML. We are also testing methods that could further enhance the ability of infused NK cells to kill AML cells, by genetically modifying them to recognize a common molecule, CD123, on AML cells and by protecting them from the inhibitory cytokine TGF-beta. 1","11681365; ","REZVANI, KATY ;","MERRITT, WILLIAM D.","12/20/2016","11/30/2021","Acute Myelocytic Leukemia; Allogenic; Allografting; Antigen-Presenting Cells; base; Binding; Bone Marrow Transplantation; Cancer Patient; CASP9 gene; CD28 gene; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell physiology; Cell Therapy; Cells; cellular targeting; chimeric antigen receptor; Clinical; Clinical Trials; cost effective; cytokine; cytotoxic; cytotoxicity; Data; Defect; Disease Progression; Dominant-Negative Mutation; Dose; effective therapy; Engineering; ethnic minority population; Figs - dietary; Genes; genetically modified cells; Goals; Graft-vs-Host Disease; Hematopoietic; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; high risk; Homing; Human; human leukocyte antigen testing; IL3RA gene; Immune; Immune system; Immunocompetent; Immunosuppressive Agents; Immunotherapy; improved; improved outcome; Infusion procedures; Interleukin-15; interleukin-21; Interleukin-3 Receptor; K-562; Killings; Laboratories; leukemia; Lymphocyte; Malignant Neoplasms; Measures; Mediating; Membrane; Methods; Myeloid Leukemia; Natural Killer Cells; novel; novel strategies; Pathway interactions; Patient observation; Patients; peripheral blood; Phenotype; Play; Positioning Attribute; Pre-Clinical Model; prevent; Procedures; Protocols documentation; racial minority; reconstitution; Recovery; Recovery of Function; Recurrent disease; Regulation; Relapse; relapse risk; Research; Resistance; Retroviral Vector; Risk; Role; Safety; Siblings; Signal Transduction; Specificity; Stem cells; suicide gene; Surface; Surface Antigens; Testing; TGFBR2 gene; Toxic effect; Transforming Growth Factor beta; Translating; Transplantation; Treatment Failure; Umbilical Cord Blood; Umbilical Cord Blood Transplantation; ","Off-the-shelf engineered NK cells for the treatment of AML","211044","CONC","Clinical Oncology Study Section ","","","01","228750","137250","366000",""

As more children with vertically infected HIV survive, understanding the impact of the disease on health outcomes is critically important. This is particularly true for cognitive health as mounting evidence from multiple patient cohorts reveal residual cognitive abnormalities despite stable treatment with cART. This project addresses potential viral and host factors that underlie persistent cognitive impairment in vertically infected children, including viral co-receptor tropism, immunological reservoirs of virus, and immunophenotyping. The study will take place in Myanmar where HIV+ and HIV- children live in separate orphanages with highly similar socioeconomic conditions and HIV+ children receive directly observed cART. Identification of viral and immunological mechanisms associated with persistent cognitive impairment despite stable cART conducted within the controlled environments of the orphanages has potential to help direct treatment approaches and potentially inform cure strategies.","1867867; ","PAUL, ROBERT H;","JOSEPH, JEYMOHAN ","12/22/2016","11/30/2021","Address; Adolescent; Adult; advanced disease; Age; antiretroviral therapy; Biological Assay; Biological Markers; Brain; Caregivers; CCR5 gene; CD14 gene; CD4 Lymphocyte Count; Cells; chemokine; Child; Childhood; Clinical; Cognition; Cognitive; cognitive function; cognitive performance; cognitive testing; cohort; Controlled Environment; critical period; CXCR4 gene; cytokine; Data; Data Analytics; demographics; design; Development; Disease; DNA; Enrollment; Ensure; Event; Exhibits; experience; Face; Frequencies; Funding; Health; HIV; Human Resources; immune activation; Immunologic Factors; Immunologic Markers; Immunophenotyping; Impaired cognition; improved; indexing; Individual; Infection; Integration Host Factors; Interleukin-1; Investigation; Laboratory Study; Life; Link; Macrophage Activation; Measures; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; Methods; monocyte; Myanmar; Myelogenous; Neopterin; Neurocognitive Deficit; Neuropathogenesis; neuropsychological; neurovirulence; nutrition education; Orphanages; Outcome; Patients; pediatric human immunodeficiency virus; Performance; Peripheral; persistent symptom; Phenotype; Plasma; Population; receptor; Recruitment Activity; Research; Residual state; Resources; response; Role; Science; Severity of illness; Societies; Socioeconomic Factors; socioeconomics; Southeastern Asia; Translations; Travel; Tropism; Viral; Viral reservoir; Virus; Work; young adult; Youth; ","Viral and Host Determinants of Cognitive Status in Vertically Transmitted HIV","108559","NAED","NeuroAIDS and other End-Organ Diseases Study Section ","","A1","01","554482","109182","663664",""

In recent war-related conflicts traumatic brain injury, especially mild forms or concussions, have become signature injuries producing progressive long-term damage to the brain. We discovered that treatment with naturally occurring protein factors can dramatically reduce damage resulting from mild brain injury, and help in the recovery from mild brain injury in mice. Because at least one of these factors has been used in humans it could potentially be applied quickly in people with brain damage. We propose to refine our model of mild traumatic brain injury and assess long-term pathological and cognitive changes. Most importantly, we will treat such impaired mice with neuroregenerative protein therapies days, weeks or months after the initial traumatic impact occurred. If successful, our findings could be rapidly transferred to clinical studies in humans; hopefully benefiting veterans in the near future in the recovery and rehabilitation from brain injury.","2204829; ","WYSS-CORAY, TONY ;","","01/01/2014","12/31/2018","Accounting; Acute Brain Injuries; Affect; Aftercare; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Anxiety; Applications Grants; Attenuated; base; Behavior; behavior test; Behavioral; behavioral impairment; Biological; Bolus Infusion; Brain; Brain Concussion; Brain Injuries; Chronic; chronic traumatic encephalopathy; Clinic; Clinical Research; Closed head injuries; Cognition; Cognitive; cognitive change; Cognitive deficits; Conflict (Psychology); CSF1 gene; Data; Dementia; early onset; Environmental Risk Factor; experience; FDA approved; fear memory; Frontotemporal Dementia; Future; Genetic Models; Gliosis; Growth Factor Gene; Head; Health; Hematopoietic System; Human; Inflammation; injured; Injury; interest; Lead; Learning; Ligands; Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor; Measurement; Measures; Mediating; Memory impairment; Mental Depression; mild traumatic brain injury; Military Personnel; Modeling; Molecular; Monitor; Motor; mouse model; Mus; Nerve Degeneration; Nerve Regeneration; Neuraxis; neurobehavioral; Neurodegenerative Disorders; neuroinflammation; Neurons; neuropsychological; Neurotoxins; Parkinson Disease; Parkinsonian Disorders; Pathology; Patients; Population; pre-clinical; Proteins; receptor; Receptor Signaling; Recovery; Recurrence; reduce symptoms; regenerative; Rehabilitation therapy; Social Interaction; stroke; Symptoms; Testing; Time; Translations; Traumatic Brain Injury; Variant; Veterans; War; white matter change; ","Aging and Inflammation in Mild Traumatic Brain Injury","001218","RRDB","Brain Injury ","","","03","","","",""

This novel tracer will allow for imaging with a positron emission tomography (PET) scanner including PET/CT or PET/MR in contrast to conventional imaging with 123I-MIBG using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging. Potential advantages of 18F-MFBG imaging include single-day imaging, leading to greater patient convenience and higher patient compliance. Additional advantages include superior image quality using a PET/CT or PET/MR scanner, lower radiation burden to children by use of PET/MR, and the ability to quantify lesion uptake and disease burden. In the future, once validated, 18F-MFBG has great potential to replace the current imaging standard (123I-MIBG) and set new imaging standards for management of neuroblastoma.","7648295; ","PANDIT-TASKAR, NEETA ;","HENDERSON, LORI A.","01/01/2016","12/31/2017","abstracting; Adopted; analog; Biologic Characteristic; Biological Markers; burden of illness; Cells; Characteristics; Child; Clinic; Clinical; Clinical Trials; Compliance behavior; contrast imaging; Data; Detection; Diagnosis; Disease; Dose; Dose-Limiting; Evaluation; Fluorides; follow-up; Future; Gamma Cameras; Goals; High Resolution Computed Tomography; Hour; Human; human study; Image; Image Analysis; image processing; imaging agent; imaging modality; improved; Inferior; Injection of therapeutic agent; Ionizing radiation; Isotopes; Label; Lesion; Liver; Lung; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Malignant Neoplasms; Measures; Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center; Metabolic; metaiodobenzylguanidine; Modality; Monitor; Neuroblastoma; Neuroendocrine Tumors; Neurosecretory Systems; novel; Organ; Patients; pediatric patients; Phase; phase 2 study; phase 3 study; Phase I Clinical Trials; Photons; physical property; Pilot Projects; Play; Positron; Positron-Emission Tomography; Property; Quality of Care; Radiation; Radiolabeled; radiotracer; Rare Diseases; Reporter Genes; Research; research clinical testing; Research Infrastructure; Resolution; Role; Safety; Scanning; Site; Soft Tissue Disorder; Staging; standard of care; System; Technology; Time; TimeLine; Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon; Tracer; trafficking; Translations; treatment planning; treatment response; tumor; uptake; Validation; validation studies; X-Ray Computed Tomography; ","A First-in-Human Pilot Study of 18F-MFBG Imaging for Evaluation of Neuroblastoma","204093","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","01","228750","163328","392078",""

The system is composed of a treadmill that can simulate different environmental situations such as walking up stairs and hills and going around curves. The treadmill is synchronized with an immersive display and an avatar of the user. The combination of variable terrain and visual feedback is extremely promising as a means for amputee patients to achieve improved functional mobility after gait training. The proposed work is relevant to public health because it is the first step in developing a novel rehabilitation system that will use visual feedback for gait training in amputees and others with pathological gait disorders. The research is pertinent to the mission of the Department of Veterans Affairs which is committed to improve the quality of life of veterans with disability.","9888679; ","D'ANDREA, SUSAN ELIZABETH;","","12/01/2014","06/30/2017","Address; Amputation; Amputees; Clinical; Clinical Practice Guideline; clinically significant; combat; comparative efficacy; compare effectiveness; Complement; Computer software; Custom; Degenerative polyarthritis; design; Diabetes Mellitus; disability; effective intervention; Effectiveness; Elements; Energy Metabolism; Environment; Equilibrium; evidence base; experience; falls; Feedback; functional gain; functional outcomes; Gait; Gait abnormality; gait examination; gait rehabilitation; gait retraining; Healthcare; Impairment; improved; indexing; Individual; Injury; innovation; instrument; Intervention Studies; Investigation; limb amputation; Low Back Pain; Lower Extremity; Mission; mobility rehabilitation; Motor; motor control; Movement; Musculoskeletal; Musculoskeletal Equilibrium; novel; patient population; Patients; Pattern; Physical Rehabilitation; Prevalence; Price; Proprioception; Prosthesis; Protocols documentation; Public Health; public health relevance; Quality of Care; Quality of life; Randomized Clinical Trials; Rehabilitation therapy; Research; Research Design; Secondary to; somatosensory; Sorting - Cell Movement; standard of care; Step Tests; stroke; Surface; System; Technology; Testing; Time; tool; Training; Training Programs; treadmill; treadmill training; trial comparing; Variant; Vascular Diseases; Veterans; virtual; virtual reality; Visual; visual feedback; visual motor; Visual Perception; Visual system structure; visual-vestibular; Walking; Water; Work; ","Virtual Reality Rehabilitation for Individuals with Lower Limb Amputation","001598","RRDS","Rehabilitation Research and Development SPiRE Program ","","","03","","","",""

Besides their impact in public health, HF- causing NWA pose also a credible biodefense threat. No FDA-licensed arenavirus vaccines are available, and current anti-arenavirus therapy is limited to the use of ribavirin, which is only partially effective and associated with side effects. In this R21 exploratory grant application we propose to generate cross-reactive NWA GP- specific human V region monoclonal antibodies (hVMAbs) using sequential plasmid DNA immunization of the VelocImmune mouse with selected NWA GPs that will be characterized for their cross-reactivity and broadly neutralizing (BN) activity against HF NWA both in cell-based assays and in vivo. The identification and characterization of NWA GP-specific BNhVMAbs will facilitate the development of an antibody (Ab)-based therapy to treat infections by HF NWA, as well as the generation of immunogens able to induce BN responses to develop a pan-NWA vaccine and the development of broad-spectrum anti-NWA drugs via targeting the conserved epitopes identified by these BNhVMAbs.","9075979; ","MARTINEZ-SOBRIDO, LUIS ;","REPIK, PATRICIA M.","12/19/2016","11/30/2018","Adverse effects; Aerosols; Antibodies; Antigenic Variation; Antigens; Antiviral Agents; Applications Grants; Arenavirus; Arenavirus Infections; Argentina; Attenuated; B-Lymphocytes; base; Binding; biodefense; Biological Assay; Bolivia; Bolivian Hemorrhagic Fever Virus; Brazil; Categories; Cells; Chapare Virus; Collection; combat; cross reactivity; Cultured Cells; Data; design; Development; Disease; Dose; Epitopes; Exhibits; Follow-Up Studies; Generations; Glycoproteins; Goals; Grant; Guanarito virus; Health; HIV-1; Human; human monoclonal antibodies; humanized monoclonal antibodies; Hybridomas; Immune Sera; Immunization; Immunotherapeutic agent; Immunotherapy; in vitro activity; in vivo; Individual; Infection; influenzavirus; interest; Junin virus; Knowledge; Label; Lassa Fever; Latino; Licensing; Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus; member; Membrane Glycoproteins; Monoclonal Antibodies; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Mus; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease; neutralizing antibody; neutralizing monoclonal antibodies; novel; Old World Arenaviruses; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pichinde; plasmid DNA; Production; Public Health; Readiness; Recombinants; response; reverse genetics; Ribavirin; Rodent; Serum; Source; Survivors; Symptoms; Tacaribe Complex Viruses; Technology; Therapeutic; Time; tool; transmission process; vaccine development; Vaccines; Venezuela; Viral; Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers; Virus; Virus Diseases; ","Development of Human Broadly Neutralizing Monoclonal Antibodies Against New World Arenaviruses?","128097","VIRA","Virology - A Study Section ","","","01","177125","40344","217469",""

Specifically, following the successful completion of Phase I studies, in the present Phase II application we propose the final development and commercialization of a human and mouse genome-wide high-performance CRISPR screening platform, with innovative features enhancing the frequency of effective irreversible gene disruption, and the intensity of reversible gene activation and repression. As supporting tools, we will provide protocols, reagents and software tools for screening data analysis and validation. Through specific inactivation of each protein-encoding gene in the genome, one gene at the time in a pooled cell population, researchers will be able to associate specific gene inactivation to specific phenotypes, such as disease progression or regression, greatly facilitating the discovery of new therapy targets.

Attempts at neuromodulation using Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) have targeted a number of loci in the brain arousal pathways. However, recovery stimulating single locations remains modest. We discovered that activation of a subset of neurons within the lower brainstem produces awakening from a coma-like state by engaging multiple arousal pathways. Utilizing novel technology to visualize global brain activity, we will investigate these neurons an their ability to recruit arousal pathways.","10322323; ","CALDERON, DIANY PAOLA;","GNADT, JAMES W","12/01/2016","11/30/2020","Adrenergic Agents; Anesthesia procedures; Animals; Anterior; Anterior Hypothalamus; Area; Arousal; awake; basal forebrain; Basic Science; Behavior; Bilateral; Brain; Brain Injuries; Brain Stem; Cell Nucleus; Cells; Cervical; cholinergic neuron; Coma; Complement; Conscious; Data; Deep Brain Stimulation; diencephalon; Disinhibition; Dorsal; dorsal raphe nucleus; Elements; extracellular; Fire - disasters; FOS gene; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; gamma-Aminobutyric Acid; Glutamates; Goals; Health; Hypothalamic structure; Imaging technology; improved; in vivo; innovative technologies; Intralaminar Nuclear Group; Label; Light; Location; locus ceruleus structure; Methodology; midbrain central gray substance; Midbrain structure; Motor; neuronal circuitry; Neurons; neuroregulation; new technology; noradrenergic; novel; novel strategies; optogenetics; parabrachial nucleus; Parvalbumins; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pontine structure; Population; Posterior Hypothalamus; prevent; Recovery; Recruitment Activity; relating to nervous system; response; Reticular Formation; Role; Sensory; Site; Sleep; Stimulus; Structure; System; Testing; Thalamic structure; Unconscious State; Ventral Tegmental Area; Wakefulness; Weather; ","Contribution of Gigantocellular neurons of the medullar reticular formation to awakening from a low brain activity state","094655","SAT","Surgery, Anesthesiology and Trauma Study Section ","","","02","270702","113339","384041",""
