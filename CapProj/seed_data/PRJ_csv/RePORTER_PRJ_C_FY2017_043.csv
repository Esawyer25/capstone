Because WM is involved in the nerve signal transduction to and from the cerebral cortex, white matter injury (WMI) is a major cause of long term functional disability in stroke. Thus, interventions targeted at WMI may significantly improve post-stroke quality of life. Despite its importance, WMI has been largely neglected in animal studies as well as in clinical treatment/trials, perhaps explaining the many failed or ineffective treatments of stroke.  Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is a key enzyme that regulates the production of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NAD), the major source of cellular energy. Previous studies have found that NAMPT is an important endogenous neuroprotective molecule against ischemic stroke. The mechanisms underlying the protection afforded by NAMPT may be the supply of extra energy and the activation of NAD- related signaling pathways. NAMPT normally localizes inside cells, where it functions as an NAD producer. However, we have discovered a new form of NAMPT which is secreted by neural cells to form extracellular NAMPT (eNAMPT) in the brain. Interestingly, we have also found that recombinant eNAMPT protein can cross the blood-brain barrier and protect both gray and white matter after cerebral ischemia. Thus, this proposal will study the white matter protective effect o this novel form of NAMPT and the underlying mechanisms. Our long term goal is to fill the remaining gaps in our understanding of WMI in ischemic stroke and gain deeper insights into WMI. This project serves a dual role; not only will it impact our understanding of the basic molecular mechanisms of ischemic WMI but also will shed light on NAMPT as a potential therapeutic target for stroke.

Over time, environmental and genetic factors lead to a degradation in hearing often termed Age Related Hearing Loss (ARHL). Despite multiple factors leading to ARHL, there are common steps in deterioration of function. We are proposing that loss of hair cell synapses and synaptic function is an early step in the process that might provide sites for early intervention. We will compare synaptic function at the systems, cellular, molecular and protein levels to identify the temporal windows of hearing loss in three distinct models of ARHL to test this hypothesis. The goal is to reduce or slow hearing loss by supporting synaptic activity and functional innervations at the auditory periphery.","1967358; ","RICCI, ANTHONY J;","","","","Address; Age; Age of Onset; Aging; Animal Model; Animals; associated symptom; Auditory; Auditory Brainstem Responses; Biophysics; Calcium; Calcium Channel; Cell physiology; Cochlea; Cochlear nucleus; Collaborations; Complex; Data; Deterioration; Early Intervention; Electric Capacitance; electrical property; electron tomography; Electrophysiology (science); Elements; Ensure; Environment; Fiber; Frequencies; Functional disorder; ganglion cell; Genetic; Glutamates; Goals; Hair Cells; Hearing; hearing impairment; Homeostasis; Image; Immune; Inbred CBA Mice; Ion Channel; Lead; loss of function; Maintenance; Measurement; Measures; Mechanics; Modeling; Molecular; Monitor; mouse model; Mus; Mutation; nerve supply; Neuraxis; Noise-Induced Hearing Loss; novel; Optics; Organ; Pathway interactions; Physiological; postsynaptic; Presbycusis; presynaptic; Process; Property; Proteins; Quality of life; Research; Research Personnel; sensor; Signal Transduction; Site; socioeconomics; sound; spiral ganglion; Spontaneous Otoacoustic Emissions; Supporting Cell; Synapses; synaptic function; Synaptic Potentials; Synaptic Transmission; Synaptic Vesicles; System; Techniques; Technology; Testing; Time; time use; trafficking; Vesicle; vesicular release; vibration; Width; Work; ","Functional Integrity of the Aging Auditory Synapse","051443","ZAG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","5512","","02","265028","0","","265028"

Its monogenic etiology makes Wolfram syndrome more amenable to discover drugs targeting ER dysfunction than other common conditions in which multiple factors typically interact to produce the disease manifestations. Our study on Wolfram may lead to a breakthrough for treatments of such common diseases, including diabetes, neurodegeneration, and blindness.","7750808; ","URANO, FUMIHIKO ;","AUSTIN, BOBBIE ANN ","07/18/2017","06/30/2019","Adolescent; Atrial Fibrillation; Atrophic; Binding; Blindness; Brain; C-Peptide; Calcium; Calpain; Cell Death; Cell Line; Cell model; Cell physiology; Cell Survival; Cells; Cessation of life; Chronic Disease; Cleaved cell; Clinical Trials; Computational algorithm; Cytosol; Dantrolene; Defect; Diabetes Insipidus; Diabetes Mellitus; disability; Disease; Dose; Drug Targeting; efficacy testing; Endoplasmic Reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum stress; Equilibrium; Etiology; Extravasation; FDA approved; Functional disorder; Genes; Glucose; Glucose tolerance test; Harvest; hearing impairment; Hereditary Disease; Human; In Situ Nick-End Labeling; induced pluripotent stem cell; Insulin; insulin secretion; Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; intraperitoneal; islet; knock-down; Knockout Mice; Lead; Link; Malignant hyperpyrexia due to anesthesia; Measures; Molecular; Monitor; Morphology; mouse model; Mus; Mutation; Nerve Degeneration; nerve stem cell; Neurologic; neuron loss; neuronal survival; Neurons; Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; novel; Optic Nerve; Oral; outcome forecast; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase; Plant Roots; polypeptide C; preclinical study; premature; prevent; prototype; Quality of life; recessive genetic trait; Recurrence; Reporting; Retinal Ganglion Cells; Rodent; Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel; Ryanodine Receptors; Safety; Saline; small molecule; Sodium; Spastic; spasticity; Spectrin; Staining method; Stains; Structure of beta Cell of islet; Syndrome; targeted treatment; Testing; Therapeutic; Tungsten; Visual Acuity; Weight; WFS1 gene; Wolfram Syndrome; ","AN ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM CALCIUM STABILIZER FOR THE TREATMENT OF WOLFRAM SYNDROME","002065","ZTR1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","200000","105000","305000",""

The pathophysiology of these tremor disorders is thought to be related to abnormal brain networks but is not completely understood. We plan to examine the brain networks in essential tremor and dystonic tremor with advanced imaging techniques to enhance the current pathophysiological understanding. We will use task based functional MRI protocol to examine the brain activity in cerebellum-motor cortex network and basal ganglia-motor cortex network. We will examine the connectivity patterns in these networks with task based functional MRI and diffusion weighted structural imaging techniques.

However, some 60% of all Mexican immigrants are undocumented during a time when legal status has become a powerful predictor of socioeconomic status, health, and well-being. As the baby boom retires and the workforce is increasingly composed of first and second generation Latino workers, the health and economic status of Mexican migrants will have profound effects on the well-being of the aging white population who they will be supporting through their work and taxes.

This research is a prospective cohort study that investigates the causes and consequences of post-transplant metabolic syndrome in children and young adults after liver transplant-with a focus on two modifiable factors that appear to drive the condition: obesity and adverse effects of immunosuppressive medications (calcineurin-inhibitors, corticosteroids). Results will allow development of evidence-based screening and management strategies for post-transplant metabolic syndrome that aim to reduce morbidity and mortality in the growing population of long-term survivors of pediatric liver transplant.","10905215; ","PERITO, EMILY ROTHBAUM;","SASLOWSKY, DAVID E","09/15/2014","06/30/2019","Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Adult; Adverse effects; Age; Atherosclerosis; Award; Calcineurin inhibitor; Cardiovascular Diseases; cardiovascular risk factor; Cardiovascular system; career development; Cause of Death; Cell physiology; Child; Childhood; Cirrhosis; Clinical; Clinical Investigator; cohort; Cross-Sectional Studies; Data; Data Analyses; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; Dose; Dyslipidemias; Endocrinologist; Enrollment; Environmental Risk Factor; Epidemic; Epidemiologist; Epidemiology; Event; evidence base; Future; Gastroenterologist; Gender; Glucose Intolerance; Goals; Health; High Density Lipoproteins; Hypertension; Hypertriglyceridemia; Impairment; improved; Individual; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Integration Host Factors; Intervention; Intervention Studies; Investigation; lipid metabolism; liver transplantation; Long-Term Survivors; Maintenance; Medial; Mentors; Metabolic syndrome; Modification; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Natural immunosuppression; nephrotoxicity; Non obese; non-alcoholic fatty liver; Obesity; Organ; Organ Transplantation; Outcome; Overweight; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Population; PPP3CA gene; Prevalence; prevent; programs; prospective; Prospective cohort; Prospective cohort study; Protocols documentation; public health relevance; Research; Research Design; Research Personnel; Risk; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Science; screening; Severities; Solid; standard of care; statistics; Structure of beta Cell of islet; therapy design; Thick; Toxic effect; Training; Transplant Recipients; Transplantation; Visit; Withdrawal; young adult; ","Metabolic Syndrome after Pediatric Liver Transplant: Causes and Consequences","099253","DDK","Kidney, Urologic and Hematologic Diseases D Subcommittee ","","","04","185231","12133","197364",""

There is virtually no effective treatment for AKI because the fundamental mechanisms that lead to kidney blood vessel dysfunction are poorly understood. We will utilize our unique technique to directly address a novel signaling molecule, sphingosine-1-phosphate, in the development of renal blood vessel dysfunction in AKI. The impact of this study will be on improved understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the renal blood vessel injury of AKI, and will lead to new strategies for protecting kidney function and reducing the progression toward CKD.","10188408; ","GUAN, ZHENGRONG ;","RYS-SIKORA, KRYSTYNA E","07/18/2017","05/31/2021","Acute; Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis; Address; Affect; Aftercare; Agonist; American; arteriole; Biological Markers; Blood; Blood flow; Blood Vessels; Chronic Kidney Failure; Clinical; Data; Development; Dialysis patients; edg-1 Protein; effective therapy; Enzymes; Event; Functional disorder; Genetic; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Goals; H218 Protein; Health Care Costs; hemodynamics; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; Inflammation; Injury; insight; Ischemia; Juxtamedullary Nephron; Kidney; Knock-out; Knockout Mice; Laser-Doppler Flowmetry; Lead; Link; Measures; Mediating; Microvascular Dysfunction; mimetics; mortality; Mus; NADPH Oxidase; new therapeutic target; novel; Outcome; Oxidative Stress; Plasma; Preparation; prevent; Production; protein expression; Rattus; Reactive Oxygen Species; Receptor Activation; receptor expression; Regulation; Renal Blood Flow; Renal function; renal ischemia; Reperfusion Injury; Reperfusion Therapy; response; Role; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Signaling Molecule; Sphingolipids; sphingosine 1-phosphate; sphingosine kinase; Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptor; Superoxide Dismutase; Survivors; Techniques; tempol; Testing; Tissues; Tubular formation; Ultrasonics; vasoconstriction; virtual; Work; xanthine oxidase inhibitor; ","Sphingosine-1-phosphate in renal microvascular dysfunction of ischemia-reperfusion kidney injury","106500","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","01","241404","114656","356060",""

We have recently published that activated Ras signals through the MAPK pathway to promote mitochondrial fission. This mitochondrial fission is in turn required for MAPK-driven tumor growth. However, why mitochondrial fission is important for tumor growth remains to be understood. This proposal sets out to determine how mitochondrial fragmentation impacts the physiological processes necessary for tumor growth. If successful, these studies will reveal novel, physiologically-relevant and mechanistic insights into how activation of the Ras-MAPK pathway promotes tumor growth. Furthermore, these studies will elucidate novel regulatory mechanisms of mitochondrial dynamics and potentially provide novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of Ras-driven cancers.","11889657; ","NASCIMENTO, ALDO ;","MCNEIL, NICOLE E","07/01/2016","06/30/2019","Affect; Apoptosis; Apoptotic; Automobile Driving; Autophagocytosis; base; Biological Assay; Cell Cycle; Cell Cycle Progression; cell growth; cell growth regulation; Cell Line; Cell physiology; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Cells; Cellular Metabolic Process; Characteristics; Community Outreach; Defect; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; Disease; Environment; Equilibrium; Exhibits; experimental study; extracellular; fighting; Genes; Genetic; Glutamine; Glycolysis; Goals; Health; Human; Hypoxia; In Vitro; insight; KRAS2 gene; Link; Maintenance; Malignant neoplasm of pancreas; Malignant Neoplasms; Mammalian Cell; MAP Kinase Gene; Measures; meetings; Metabolic; Metabolic Pathway; Metabolism; Mitochondria; Molecular; Morphology; Mutation; neoplastic cell; Neurodegenerative Disorders; new therapeutic target; Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; novel; Obesity; Oncogenic; Operative Surgical Procedures; Oxidative Phosphorylation; Oxidative Stress; Oxygen Consumption; pancreatic cancer cells; Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma; pancreatic neoplasm; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pharmacology; Phenotype; Phosphorylation; Physiological; Physiological Processes; Play; Process; Proteins; public health relevance; Publishing; Radioactive Tracers; Regulation; Research; Research Personnel; Research Project Grants; Resected; Resistance; Role; Series; Shapes; Signal Transduction; sound; Specificity; Specimen; Stress; symposium; System; Testing; Therapeutic Intervention; tissue culture; Training; tumor; tumor growth; tumorigenesis; tumorigenic; Tumorigenicity; Work; ","Tumor-associated Physiological Changes Arising from Ras-induced Mitochondrial Fission","196329","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","31376","","31376",""

The proposed research is of major significance to public health because the results obtained in this project will aid in understanding the etiology, processes, and connected relationship of traumatic brain injury, tau misfolding and aggregation, and disease as well as the prospective capability for early diagnosis of tau affiliated diseases.","12573304; ","EDWARDS III, GEORGE ALLEN;","BELLGOWAN, PATRICK S.

As a result of antiretroviral therapies, HIV-positive individuals are living for many decades post infection. HIV enters the CNS within 4-14 days after peripheral infection and despite antiretroviral therapy (ART), persists within the CNS. This results in the establishment of viral reservoirs within the brain and low level, ongoing neuroinflammation and neuronal damage that together result in HIV associated neurocognitive disorders, or HAND, in >50% of infected people even with successful ART. The prevalence of HAND keeps increasing as infected people live longer, and there are no therapies for HAND. Thus, neuroAIDS is a major global health problem. An understanding of mechanisms that mediate seeding of the brain with HIV by infected monocytes and identification and characterization of these cells that establish and replenish CNS HIV reservoirs and mediate HAND are critical to development of therapeutic strategies to limit the consequences of CNS HIV infection and its subsequent damage.","1891039 (contact); 1872697; ","BERMAN, JOAN WEINBERGER (contact); MORGELLO, SUSAN ;","JOSEPH, JEYMOHAN ","07/19/2017","04/30/2022","Address; Affect; ALCAM gene; antiretroviral therapy; Biological Assay; Biological Markers; Blocking Antibodies; Blood - brain barrier anatomy; Brain; brain volume; CCL2 gene; CCR5 gene; CD14 Antigen; CD14 gene; Cell Count; Cells; Characteristics; chemokine; Chronic; cognitive testing; cohort; CXC Chemokines; Disease; Ensure; Enteral; FCGR3B gene; global health; hand therapy; HIV; HIV Infections; HIV Seropositivity; HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder; Human; Impaired cognition; Impairment; In Vitro; Individual; Infection; Inflammation; inhibitor/antagonist; Integration Host Factors; JAM protein; Longitudinal cohort; Longitudinal Studies; macrophage; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Maintenance; Mediating; Modeling; monocyte; monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 receptor; Nerve Degeneration; neuroAIDS; Neurobiology; neuroimaging; neuroinflammation; Neurons; Neuropathogenesis; Pathogenesis; performance tests; Peripheral; peripheral blood; Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell; Phenotype; Prevalence; Property; Proteins; receptor; response; Surface; Therapeutic; therapeutic development; therapeutic target; Time; translational study; Viral; viral DNA; Viral reservoir; Virus; Virus Diseases; ","Monocyte CNS HIV entry & neurodegeneration: Translational studies in the CART era","112391","NAED","NeuroAIDS and other End-Organ Diseases Study Section ","","A1","01","530667","220809","751476",""

Combining immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) with radiation (RT) has improved responses, but we do not understand the underlying mechanisms and many patients still progress. Based on pre-clinical and clinical evidence, we have described a PDL1 circuit, likely linked to IFN signaling, acting as a dominant resistance mechanism to ICB + RT. Here we will test how overall tumor burden and prolonged IFN signaling drive PD-L1-independent resistance pathways, and define the genomic/epigenomic changes in tumor cells and T cells, that will provide the next generation of immunotherapy targets to increase the efficacy and durability of responses.","2044283; ","WHERRY, E.

The causes of these complications will be analyzed using a mouse model of Artemis-deficient SCID developed in our lab. Moreover, we will examine the impact of alternative conditioning regimens on the observed late toxicities.

The current project seeks to evaluate the novel association between Helicobacter pylori protein-specific infection and colorectal cancer risk, building the groundwork for significantly strengthening colorectal cancer prevention and screening strategies with a new risk biomarker, as well as the possibility of identifying an exposure that is proven to be modifiable through the use of eradication therapy, and may be modifiable by a regimen of regular aspirin use.","10222844; ","EPPLEIN, MEIRA ;","STARKS, VAURICE ","05/01/2015","04/30/2019","African American; Age; Age-Years; Antibiotics; Antibodies; Aspirin; Bacteria; base; Biological Markers; Blood; cancer diagnosis; cancer prevention; Cancer Prevention Study II; cancer risk; carcinogenicity; Carcinogens; case control; Chronic; Cohort Studies; Collection; Colon; Colon Carcinoma; Colorectal; Colorectal Cancer; colorectal cancer prevention; Communities; Community Health Centers; cost effective; Cytotoxin; Death Rate; design; Developing Countries; Diagnosis; Disease; Distant; Dose; epidemiology study; Evaluation; experience; Exposure to; Follow-Up Studies; Future; Gastric mucosa; Health; Health Professional; Helicobacter Infections; Helicobacter pylori; High Prevalence; Histologic; Human; Incidence; Individual; Infection; Inflammation; interest; Literature; Low income; Lung; Malignant Neoplasms; malignant stomach neoplasm; men; Meta-Analysis; Modification; Nested Case-Control Study; novel; Nurses' Health Study; Outcome; Ovarian; Participant; Persons; Physicians; Population; Prevalence; Prevention; Prevention strategy; prospective; Prospective cohort study; Prospective Studies; Prostate; protective effect; Proteins; Proton Pump Inhibitors; Public Health; public health relevance; racial disparity; Recruitment Activity; Regimen; Reporting; Research; response; Risk; Risk Factors; screening; Serologic tests; Site; Southeastern United States; Stomach; stroke; Surveys; Time; Uninsured; Variant; Virulence Factors; Virulent; Woman; Women's Health; Work; ","Helicobacter pylori protein-specific antibodies and colorectal cancer risk","190428","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","03","402370","151257","553627",""

Recent data indicate that alcoholic liver disease (ALD) affects over 10 million Americans. The long-term goals of this research project are to identify the mechanisms of HO-1 that are responsible for protection from inflammation and liver damage. Previous work has identified the intestine as a critical contributor to ALD progression. Increases in intestinal permeability and changes in the bacterial microbiota following chronic ethanol result in elevated levels of bacterial products such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in both alcoholic patients and animal models of ALD. The recognition of LPS by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on liver resident Kupffer cells, promotes the release of inflammatory cytokines that impact the survival of hepatocytes. Preliminary data indicate that the protection of intestinal tight junctions contribute to the protection by HO-1. Therefore, the overall objective of this proposal is to investigate the impact of HO-1 in preserving the function of the intestinal barrier during chronic ethanol consumption. Understanding the protective mechanisms within the intestinal liver axis will provide the foundation for the future development therapeutic interventions to slow or reverse alcoholic liver disease.","12301078; ","BELLOS, DAMIEN ;","DUNTY, JR., WILLIAM ","07/16/2015","07/15/2018","Affect; Alcohol abuse; Alcohol consumption; alcohol exposure; alcohol response; Alcoholic liver damage; Alcoholic Liver Diseases; American; Animal Model; Biliverdine; Biological Assay; Biological Preservation; Caco-2 Cells; Carbon Monoxide; Cell Death; cell type; Cessation of life; chemokine; Chronic; chronic alcohol ingestion; Clinical Research; Cobalt; cobaltiprotoporphyrin; Colon; cytokine; Data; Diet; Disease Progression; Distal; Electrical Resistance; Endotoxins; Enzymes; Epithelial; Epithelial Cells; Ethanol; Ethanol Metabolism; experimental study; Extravasation; feeding; Ferritin; fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran; Foundations; Functional disorder; Future; Goals; Heme; heme oxygenase-1; Hepatocyte; Hindgut; Human; ileum; Immune Cell Activation; Immunohistochemistry; Inflammation; Inflammatory; inhibitor/antagonist; intestinal epithelium; Intestines; Investigation; Iron; jejunum; Knock-out; Knockout Mice; Kupffer Cells; Lactulose; Lead; Lipopolysaccharides; Liver; Liver Dysfunction; liver inflammation; liver injury; Liver parenchyma; liver transplantation; macrophage; Mannitol; Measurement; microbial; microbiota; Molecular; monocyte; monolayer; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; mouse model; overexpression; Oxidative Stress; Pathology; Patients; Permeability; Pharmacology; Physiological; Plasmids; problem drinker; Production; protective effect; Proteins; public health relevance; Research; Research Project Grants; response; Role; Signal Transduction; small hairpin RNA; Spatial Distribution; Stress; Surface; Testing; therapeutic development; Therapeutic Intervention; Tight Junctions; Tissues; TLR4 gene; treatment group; United States; Up-Regulation; villin; Work; ","The Intestinal Role of Heme Oxygenase-1 in Alcoholic Liver Disease","024017","ZAA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","03","34080","","34080",""

The majority of fertility research has been directed toward sex-specific processes deemed to be exclusively male- or female-mediated. A detailed understanding of many sperm abnormalities contributing to subfertility or infertility has been achieved, mostly relating to sperm morphology, capacitation and motility. However, much less is known about the in vivo fate of sperm in the female reproductive tract, despite the fact that physical and molecular interactions between sperm and female reproductive tract are now recognized to be influential to sperm viability and fertilization competence. We will therefore systematically characterize the molecular maturation of sperm that results from complex postcopulatory interactions in the female reproductive tract and study the functional consequences of these modifications for sperm performance, survival and fertilization success using molecular and genetic approaches.","11708475; ","DORUS, STEPHEN ;","MOSS, STUART B.","07/19/2017","06/30/2019","Affect; Animals; base; Binding; Biological Assay; Biological Phenomena; cell motility; Cells; Competence; Complex; cost; Data; Data Set; Drosophila genus; Drosophila melanogaster; Ejaculation; Enteral; Epithelium; Equipment and supply inventories; Event; exhaustion; Experimental Designs; experimental study; Female; Fertility; Fertilization; Foundations; Future; Genes; Genetic; genetic approach; genetic manipulation; Imagery; in vivo; Infertility; Influentials; innovation; Insemination; knock-down; Knowledge; Label; life history; male; Mammalian Oviducts; Mass Spectrum Analysis; Mediating; Metabolic; Methods; migration; Modeling; Modification; Molecular; Molecular Genetics; Nature; novel; Organ; Outcome; Ovarian; Pathway interactions; Peptides; Performance; Phenotype; Post-Translational Protein Processing; Process; Protein Secretion; Proteins; Proteolytic Processing; Proteome; Proteomics; psychologic; public health relevance; reproductive; reproductive tract; Research; Research Support; Risk; RNA Interference; Role; Science; Seminal; Seminal fluid; Seminal Vesicles; sex; Signal Transduction; Specificity; sperm cell; sperm function; Sperm Maturation; sperm morphology; Sperm Motility; sperm protein; success; tandem mass spectrometry; Techniques; Time; Tissues; trait; Uncertainty; Variant; ","Sperm Motility and Molecular Interactions in the Reproductive Tract ","088910","CMIR","Cellular, Molecular and Integrative Reproduction Study Section ","","A1","01","175089","66935","242024",""

Major advances have been made in developing probes with enhanced intrinsic properties as to efficacy of reporting and/or manipulating neuronal activity. However, the utility of these probes in vivo has been limited by an inability to direct their localization to specific subcellular sites in brain neurons. We propose to develop a pipeline of genetically encoded localization modules or GELMs to direct probes for large-scale sensing and/or manipulation of neural activity to specific subcellular sites in brain neurons in vivo, and make them freely available. This will yield enhanced signal to noise ratio at any specific site, and will allow researchers and clinicians to more effectively report and/or modulate neuronal activity, an important step towards developing new ways to treat, cure, and even prevent brain disorders.","1882490; ","TRIMMER, JAMES S;","TALLEY, EDMUND M","09/30/2016","06/30/2019","Affinity; Animals; arm; Axon; base; Binding; Binding Sites; Brain; Brain Diseases; BRAIN initiative; Catalogs; Characteristics; Chimeric Proteins; Collection; Data; Databases; Dendrites; design; Development; direct application; Engineering; Epitopes; Event; Exhibits; Generations; in vivo; Intrabody; Location; Measures; Methodology; Methods; Monoclonal Antibodies; nanobodies; neuronal cell body; Neurons; neurotransmission; Noise; novel; open source; Plasmids; Potassium Channel; prevent; Property; Proteins; Protocols documentation; Publications; Reagent; relating to nervous system; Reporter; Reporting; repository; Research; Research Personnel; scaffold; Signal Transduction; Site; Specificity; Synapses; System; Technology; web site; ","Genetically Encoded Localization Modules for Targeting Activity Probes to Specific Subcellular Sites in Brain Neurons","099714","ZNS1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","863643","215270","1078913",""

Most worrying is the fact that gonococci have developed resistance to many antibiotics, including the appearance of strains resistant to ceftriaxone, which is one of the current antibiotics recommended for dual therapy of gonorrhea. We have shown that antibiotic-resistant clinical isolates have increased resistance to bactericidal antibiotics compared to antibiotic-susceptible strains transformed with all of the known resistance determinants from the clinical isolates. The first aim will define the transcriptional responses of these strains to breakpoint concentrations of a set of bactericidal antibiotics to understand how these clinical isolates resist their lethal action. A second aim will utilize transposon mutagenesis coupled with negative selection to identify genes involved in intrinsic resistance to ?-lactam antibiotics. The results will assist in the development of new therapeutics for the treatment of gonorrhea in an era when antibiotic resistance threatens treatment regimens.","1899037 (contact); 1899080; ","NICHOLAS, ROBERT A (contact); SHAFER, WILLIAM MAURICE;","HILTKE, THOMAS J.","07/18/2017","06/30/2019","Antibiotic Resistance; Antibiotic susceptibility; Antibiotic Therapy; Antibiotics; Antimicrobial Resistance; Appearance; Azithromycin; Bacteria; bactericide; beta-Lactam Resistance; Cefixime; Ceftriaxone; Cell Line; Cells; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.); Chlamydia trachomatis; Ciprofloxacin; Clinical; clinically relevant; Complex; Coupled; Development; Dose; drug development; Ectopic Pregnancy; effective therapy; Epithelial Cells; Escherichia coli; Event; Exhibits; experience; experimental study; Exposure to; Future; gene product; Genes; Genetic; genetic analysis; genetic makeup; Genetic Transcription; Genomic DNA; Gonorrhea; Growth; HIV; homologous recombination; Human; Incidence; Infection; Infertility; Injection of therapeutic agent; insight; Killings; Label; Laboratories; Lead; Mediating; Molecular; Molecular Analysis; Monobactams; Multi-Drug Resistance; Mutagenesis; Neisseria gonorrhoeae; new technology; novel strategies; novel therapeutics; Oral; pathogen; Patients; Pelvic Inflammatory Disease; Penicillins; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Predisposition; Public Health; Regimen; Reporting; Research; Resistance; Resistance development; resistance mechanism; resistant strain; response; Role; Sexually Transmitted Agents; Sexually Transmitted Diseases; Stress; success; Testing; Tetracyclines; transcriptome; transmission process; Treatment Protocols; United States; ","Molecular Analysis of Antibiotic Resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae","133004","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","161280","73815","235095",""

Here, I plan to address both of these points by implementing SWATH across multiple tissues and two environmental (dietary) factors in the BXD murine genetic reference population (50 genotypes, 100 cohorts) which will yield new in- formation on systems biology of metabolism and will also provide a stepping stone towards im- plementing SWATH in humans.","12680524; ","WILLIAMS, EVAN GRAEHL;","WILLIS, KRISTINE AMALEE","06/01/2016","05/31/2019","Address; Adipose tissue; Affect; Automobile Driving; base; biobank; Biochemical Pathway; Bioinformatics; Biological; Biology; Caenorhabditis elegans; Cell Line; cholesterol biosynthesis; cohort; Collaborations; Complex; Data; Data Set; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; Diet; Dietary Factors; dimensional analysis; Disease; DNA sequencing; Environment; Etiology; Fellowship; Genes; Genetic; Genets; Genotype; Guidelines; Heart; Heritability; high dimensionality; Human; In Vitro; in vivo; Incidence; Individual; insight; Lead; Letters; Lip structure; Literature; Liver; Mammals; Measurement; Measures; Metabolic; metabolic abnormality assessment; Metabolic Diseases; Metabolism; metabolomics; Modeling; Molecular; Mus; Nature; network models; next generation; novel; Obesity; Organism; Paint; Pathway interactions; Peptides; Phenotype; phenotypic data; Population; Population Study; Post-Translational Protein Processing; protein expression; Protein Isoforms; Proteins; Proteome; Proteomics; public health relevance; quadriceps muscle; Readiness; Reproducibility; Sampling; Shotguns; Signal Pathway; System; Systems Biology; Techniques; Technology; Testing; Tissues; trait; Transcript; transcriptome sequencing; transcriptomics; Variant; Western Blotting; Work; Yeasts; ","Identifying Biomolecular Networks Driving Metabolic Trait Variation","119190","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","S1","01","1200","","1200",""

There are more than 400,000 preventable drug-related injuries in hospitals and more than 800,000 preventable drug-related injuries in long-term care settings. We propose to implement, test and evaluate a novel system for medication administration and charting in nursing homes intended to prevent medication administration errors and improve the workflow of medication administration. The proposed system will reduce errors through the use of the IdentRx point-of-care medication administration safety system, replacing the current process that relies on staff vigilance and memory to prevent errors. Utilization of this system will improve healthcare, health of individuals and save lives. The system will greatly improve medication safety by virtually eliminating medication administration errors. It will also improve the workflow of medication administration, and provide physicians with important information on the actual medications administered to each patient.

The PI received multiple NIH SBIR awards for the pre-clinical and clinical work on ACD + ITD. In 2015 Zoll Medical bought this technology and recently has started to market it. Despite this progress further innovation is needed as most OHCA patients still die.  The centerpiece of this new Phase 1 application is a novel Head Up Position (HUP) device designed to improve neurologically favorable survival after cardiac arrest. HUP CPR increases cardio- cerebral circulation and reduces the potential for brain injury with each chest compression. This Phase 1 application is focused on establishing preclinical proof-of-concept for the HUP CPR device and building the first human prototype for clinical evaluation. The applicants have previously demonstrated that positive and negative changes in intrathoracic pressure during CPR are immediately transmitted to the brain. 8, 10 Changes in intrathoracic pressure can impact cerebral perfusion during cardiac arrest, brain injury and shock. 8, 10 ACD + ITD CPR was developed in part to harness this physiology and improve cardio-cerebral circulation. 10 Building upon ACD + ITD, the applicants discovered the concepts underlying HUP CPR in 2014 when comparing CPR with whole body head up tilt versus whole body head down tilt. 8 HUP CPR involves elevating the heart and the head about 5 and 20 cm, respectively. We have assessed this new idea in animals in cardiac arrest and human cadavers. 8-10, 16, 17 This modest elevation immediately enhances venous drainage from the brain and lowers ICP, lowers right atrial pressures, increases cardiac preload, and redistributes blood flow within the lungs thereby improving respiration and circulation within the lungs. These mechanisms contribute to a clinically significant increase in cardio-cerebral circulation and reduce the potential brain trauma associated with excessively high levels of ICP with each chest compression. Further studies in a human cadaver model demonstrated that HUP CPR immediately reduces ICP and enhances cerebral perfusion pressure. 17 Additional animal studies have also demonstrated that HUP CPR does not work with conventional S-CPR. 8, 9 S-CPR does not provide enough forward flow to pump blood ?uphill? with head elevation. 8, 9 In contrast, ACD + ITD CPR provides nearly three times more blood flow to the heart and brain compared with S-CPR, thus making it feasible and practical to perform HUP CPR. 7, 9, 10, 12  Based upon this potential advance the applicants propose to perform a series of proof-of-concept studies to determine if HUP CPR provides superior cerebral blood flow, hemodynamics, and 48 hour neurologically-intact survival rates compared with CPR in the supine position in a pig model of prolonged cardiac arrest. We further propose to build a light weight HUP CPR device prototype and assess its ease of use during manual ACD + ITD CPR and LUCAS + ITD CPR. A successful preclinical safety and effectiveness study will be the basis for the first human evaluation of head up CPR. HUP CPR has the potential to be a major breakthrough in the treatment of cardiac arrest worldwide, especially when integrated into an overall systems-based approach to pre- and post-resuscitation care.","14714488; ","LURIE, KEITH ;","SOPKO, GEORGE ","07/17/2017","07/16/2018","Abdomen; Accident and Emergency department; American; Americas; Animal Model; Animals; Award; base; Blinded; Blood; Blood Circulation; Blood flow; Blood Gas Analysis; blood pump; Brain; Brain Injuries; c new; Cadaver; Carbon Dioxide; Cardiac; Cardiac Catheterization Procedures; Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation; Caring; Cause of Death; Cerebral perfusion pressure; Cerebrovascular Circulation; Cerebrum; Chest; Clinical; Clinical Trials; clinically significant; commercialization; Communities; Coronary; coronary perfusion; design; Device Designs; Devices; Disease; Drainage procedure; Effectiveness; electric impedance; Emotional; Employee Strikes; ergonomics; Evaluation; Family; Family suidae; FDA approved; Feasibility Studies; Force of Gravity; Goals; Gold; Head; Head-Down Tilt; Heart; Heart Arrest; Heart Atrium; hemodynamics; Hospitals; Hour; Human; Human Resources; improved; innovation; Interruption; Intervention Studies; Intracranial Hypertension; Intracranial Pressure; Laboratories; light weight; Lower Extremity; Lung; Malignant Neoplasms; Manikins; Manuals; Measurement; Measures; Medical; Methods; Microspheres; Minnesota; Modeling; Modification; Nervous System Physiology; Neurologic; Neurological outcome; novel; novel strategies; Organ; Outcome; Oxygen saturation measurement; Patients; Percussion; Perfusion; Phase; Physiological; Physiology; Positioning Attribute; pre-clinical; preclinical safety; pressure; Process; programs; prototype; psychologic; Pupil light reflex; Reproducibility; Research; research clinical testing; Respiration; Resuscitation; Safety; Sepsis; Series; Shock; Small Business Innovation Research Grant; sound; stroke; Sudden Death; Supine Position; Survival Rate; System; Techniques; Technology; Testing; Time; Trauma; Traumatic Brain Injury; United States National Institutes of Health; Universities; Venous; Veterinarians; Work; ","Head Up Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Device","139184","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","","","224937",""

Without reliable data for underlying population risk for these rare diseases, and the risk conferred by each disease associated variant, it is not possible to computationally generate an accurate likelihood of disease in asymptomatic individuals, limiting benefits to patients from whole genome sequencing and possibly exposing them to dangerous false positive findings. In this project, we will integrate epidemiological and population genetics data to estimate the penetrance of each variant observed in an individual's genome sequence and use these data to prioritize which variants clinical geneticists should review most urgently.","8549153; ","CASSA, CHRISTOPHER ;","RAMOS, ERIN ","07/01/2013","06/30/2018","Address; Affect; Algorithms; Ambulatory Care; base; Bayesian Method; Behavioral; Benign; burden of illness; Caring; case control; Case Study; Classification; Clinical; clinical application; clinical practice; clinical risk; Clinical Trials; clinically relevant; clinically significant; cohort; Cohort Studies; Confidence Intervals; cost; Dangerousness; Data; Data Set; Databases; Development; Diagnostic; Disease; disorder risk; Environmental Risk Factor; epidemiologic data; Epidemiology; Exclusion; Foundations; Frequencies; Future; Gene Frequency; Genetic Risk; genetic variant; Genetic Variation; Genome; genome sequencing; genome-wide; genomic data; genomic variation; Gold; Hereditary Disease; Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy; improved; Incidence; Individual; individual patient; Laboratories; Link; Literature; Measures; Medical; Medical Genetics; Mendelian disorder; Methodology; Methods; Minor; Morbidity - disease rate; Neurofibromatoses; novel; novel strategies; Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man; Pathogenicity; Patient Care; Patients; Penetrance; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Physicians; Population; population based; Population Genetics; Positioning Attribute; Prevalence; Primary Health Care; Probability; Process; public health relevance; Publications; Publishing; Rare Diseases; Reporting; Research; research clinical testing; response; Risk; Risk Estimate; risk variant; Source; Standardization; Structure; Sum; Surveys; Symptoms; Tail; Translating; Variant; whole genome; ","Clinical prioritization of reported disease variants in asymptomatic individuals","007229","GNOM","National Human Genome Research Institute Initial Review Group ","","","05","140281","108718","248999",""

How radiation (RT) exerts immune stimulatory effects to enhance ICB is unclear. Understanding the mechanism of action of RT, its limitations, and ways to break through therapeutic barriers has the potential to expand the number of patients that benefit from combination therapy, while also providing biomarkers for patient selection. We address these goals by examining how RT activates tumor cell intrinsic anti-viral signaling pathways and how this impacts dendritic cells to diversify the repertoire of T cells that can be reactivated by ICB. We examine how this signaling pathway might be exploited as a potential biomarker for the immune stimulatory effects of RT and complement these efforts by investigating additional therapeutic pathways that non-redundantly enhance the efficacy of RT + ICB across multiple cancer types.","1885710; ","MINN, ANDY J;","","","","Address; Advanced Malignant Neoplasm; Agonist; Antibodies; Antigens; Antiviral Agents; cancer cell; cancer type; Cell physiology; Cells; Clinical; Clinical Trials; Combined Modality Therapy; Complement; Cross-Priming; Data; Dendritic cell activation; Dendritic Cell Pathway; Dendritic Cells; DNA; Double-Stranded RNA; Event; exosome; Extinction (Psychology); Goals; Immune; Immune checkpoint blockade; Immune response; Immune signaling; Immune system; Immunity; immunogenic; Immunologics; immunoregulation; Immunotherapy; improved; Infection; Innate Immune System; Interferons; irradiation; Ligands; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; mimicry; Modeling; Molecular; Nature; neoplastic cell; next generation; parallelization; pathogen; Pathway interactions; patient biomarkers; Patient Selection; Patients; Pattern; Pattern recognition receptor; Photons; potential biomarker; pre-clinical; Pre-Clinical Model; preclinical study; programs; Property; Proton Radiation; Radiation; radiation effect; radiation response; Radiation therapy; Receptor Signaling; response; RNA; RNA Polymerase III; Role; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Somatic Mutation; success; T-Lymphocyte; Testing; Therapeutic; TNFRSF5 gene; Treatment Efficacy; tumor; Untranslated RNA; Viral; ","Project 2: Role of radiation therapy in establishing cancer immunity","210944","ZCA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","5576","","01","331648","202305","","533953"

Herein, we explore a novel an relatively undefined area involving the roles of two developmentally-regulated microRNA families - miR-200 and miR-29 - which exist in a negative feedback loop with TGF-? and inhibit expression of the functionally-related inducers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), ZEB1/2 and Snail1/2. In this manner, miR-200 and miR-29 family members may act to promote and maintain epithelial cell differentiation and prevent acquisition of mesenchymal properties. Importantly, these miRNAs also potentially target genes and pathways that direct cells away from a pluripotent state toward a differentiated epithelial cell lineage. Moreover, sustained expression of these miRNA families and suppression of their targets also may serve key roles to prevent the differentiated distal lung epithelium from acquiring mesenchymal properties that can result in a number of pathologic conditions.","1857674; ","MENDELSON, CAROLE R.;","LIN, SARA ","04/01/1993","06/30/2018","Adenocarcinoma; Alveolar; alveolar lamellar body; alveolar type II cell; Area; base; Binding; Birth; c-myc Genes; C-terminal binding protein; Cell Differentiation process; Cell Lineage; Cell physiology; Cells; Chromatin; chromatin immunoprecipitation; chromatin modification; Complex; Cultured Cells; Cyclic AMP; Data; Development; Distal; DNA Modification Methylases; Elements; Enterobacteria phage P1 Cre recombinase; Enzymes; Epigenetic Process; Epithelial; Epithelial Cells; epithelial to mesenchymal transition; Epithelium; Family; Family member; Feedback; fetal; Fetal Development; Fetal Lung; Fibrosis; Gene Expression; Gene Targeting; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Transcription; Histone Deacetylase; Histones; Hormonal; hormone regulation; Human; Hypoxia; Impairment; inhibitor/antagonist; knock-down; Lipids; LoxP-flanked allele; Lung; lung development; Mediating; member; Mesenchymal; Microarray Analysis; MicroRNAs; Morphogenesis; mouse model; Mus; NF-kappa B; novel; overexpression; Pathogenesis; Pathologic; Pathway interactions; Pregnancy; prevent; Process; promoter; Property; public health relevance; Pulmonary Emphysema; Pulmonary Fibrosis; Pulmonary Pathology; Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Protein A; Recruitment Activity; Regulation; Role; Signal Transduction; Stem Cell Factor; surfactant; System; Tamoxifen; Testing; Time; TP53 gene; transcription factor; Transfection; Transferase; Transforming Growth Factor beta; Transforming Growth Factor beta Receptors; tumor progression; Type I Epithelial Receptor Cell; Type II Epithelial Receptor Cell; ","Mechanisms in the Regulation of SP-A Gene Expression","050022","LIRR","Lung Injury, Repair, and Remodeling Study Section ","","","24","292414","169221","461635",""

Here, the intent is to understand how specific environmental pollutants cause carcinogenesis by altering the properties of mitochondria that are components of the cell mostly known for energy production. A new method is developed for studying how environmental pollutants impact mitochondrial function in real-time. This method will be applied to study how carcinogens impact mitochondrial function to initiate tumor formation during lung and skin carcinogenesis. It is believed that these studies will reveal a new role of mitochondria in carcinogenesis and will identify new potential ways for therapeutic prevention of environmental carcinogenesis.","11627256; ","MITRA, KASTURI ;","SHAUGHNESSY, DANIEL ","05/15/2015","04/30/2018","Acute; Alpha Cell; analytical method; base; Benzo(a)pyrene; Carcinogen exposure; carcinogenesis; carcinogenicity; Carcinogens; Cell Cycle; Cell Cycle Regulation; Cell Proliferation; cell transformation; Cells; Cellular Structures; Chimeric Proteins; Confocal Microscopy; Data; Detection; Development; Dioxins; Dynamin; Environment; environmental carcinogenesis; Environmental Carcinogens; Environmental Pollutants; environmental stressor; environmental toxicology; Event; Fibroblasts; Fluorescence; Fluorescent Probes; Genetic; Growth Factor; Hot Spot; Individual; innovation; Investigation; Lead; live cell microscopy; Lung; lung carcinogenesis; Malignant neoplasm of lung; Maps; meetings; Methodology; Methods; Mitochondria; Monitor; Mus; Oncogenic; Output; Oxidation-Reduction; oxidative damage; Performance; Phase; Population; prevent; Prevention; Procedures; Process; Production; Property; Proteins; public health relevance; Quantitative Microscopy; Reactive Oxygen Species; Recruitment Activity; Regulation; Repression; Research; Resolution; response; Role; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Site; Skin; Skin Cancer; Skin Carcinogenesis; Stress; Structure; Structure-Activity Relationship; Testing; Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin; Therapeutic; Time; Toxic effect; Toxic Environmental Substances; Tumor Initiators; tumorigenic; Tumorigenicity; ","RT-SQuARED-M method to study the precise role of mitochondria in the oxidative damage caused by environmental toxins","025662","ZES1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","S1","02","101009","48990","149999",""

Fatigue interferes with everyday functioning but, unfortunately, little is known about its mechanisms. We propose a characteristic eye movement abnormality (internuclear ophthalmoparesis, INO), commonly encountered in MS, as a simple model for primary motor fatigue. We described worsening of ocular performance in MS patients with INO following visual tasks (ocular motor fatigue), which is likely due to decreased neural conduction along brain pathways injured by MS. This mechanism could represent a major component of MS-related primary motor fatigue. Relevant to Veterans' care, INO is a significant cause of visual disability, especially when complicated by ocular fatigue, and limits daily activities such as reading and driving. We propose a medical treatment to improve ocular performance/fatigue in INO, which can reduce visual disability and improve quality of life in our Veterans with MS.","11420409; ","SERRA, ALESSANDRO ;","","04/01/2015","03/31/2018","Abnormal coordination; Acceleration; adduct; Affect; Aftercare; associated symptom; Automobile Driving; Axon; base; brain pathway; Brain Stem; Caring; Categories; Characteristics; Clinical; Cognitive; Cross-Over Trials; Data; deconditioning; Demyelinations; Deterioration; disability; Disease; Double-Blind Method; Dyskinetic syndrome; effective therapy; efficacy testing; Enrollment; Equipment and supply inventories; Exercise; Exhibits; Eye; Eye Movements; Fatigue; FDA approved; foot; Frequencies; Functional disorder; Gait; gaze; Generations; horizontal gaze; Impairment; improved; improved functioning; Inflammation; injured; Limb structure; mathematical model; Measures; Medial; Medical; Mental Depression; Modeling; Motor; motor deficit; Multiple Sclerosis; multiple sclerosis patient; Muscle Fatigue; Neural Conduction; Neuraxis; Neurons; neurophysiology; neurotransmission; Nose; Ocular Motility Disorders; oculomotor; Ophthalmopareses; Outcome Measure; Pathway interactions; Patients; Performance; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Physiologic pulse; Placebo Control; Play; Population; Potassium Channel Blockers; Psyche structure; public health relevance; Quality of life; Quality-of-Life Assessment; Questionnaires; Randomized; Reading; Rehabilitation therapy; Reporting; Reproducibility; response; Role; Saccades; Severities; Signal Transduction; Site; Sleep Disorders; Speed; Testing; Time; transmission process; Veterans; Vision; Visual; visual performance; walkability; ","Study and Treatment of Visual Dysfunction and Motor Fatigue in Multiple Sclerosis","001180","RRD8","Career Development Program - Panel I ","","","03","","","",""

Particularly, HIV-1 infected macrophages serve as a key long-living viral reservoir that persistently produces viral progenies even during the course of intense antiviral therapy. This application attempts to elucidate a novel host defense mechanism that kinetically delays multiple steps of HIV life cycle in nondividing viral target cell types, by depleting cellular dNTP through a recently identified host restriction factor, SAMHD1. This application will reveal new anti-HIV target steps and strategies that effectively suppress HIV-1 life cycle in non-dividing myeloid cells that contribute to HIV-1 persistence.","1939323; ","KIM, BAEK ;","SAKALIAN, MICHAEL ","07/01/2012","06/30/2020","Active Sites; Affect; Allosteric Site; anti-viral efficacy; Antiviral Therapy; Brain; Caenorhabditis elegans; Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins; CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes; Cell Death; Cell physiology; Cell Survival; cell type; Cells; Chromosomes; Complex; Defect; Developmental Process; DNA; DNA biosynthesis; DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase; Enzymatic Biochemistry; flexibility; Funding; Genetic Recombination; HIV; HIV-1; HIV-2; Host Defense Mechanism; Human; Infection; innovation; insight; Interphase Cell; Kinetics; Lead; Length; Life Cycle Stages; macrophage; Mediating; Metabolic; Microglia; Mutation; Myeloid Cells; novel; Nucleosides; particle; pathogen; Pathogenesis; Process; Production; Property; Proteins; pseudotoxoplasmosis syndrome; public health relevance; Reaction; Regulation; repaired; Reporting; Rest; Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors; Reverse Transcription; Ribonucleases; RNA; RNA Binding; RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase; Role; SAM Domain; Series; SIV; Starvation; Structure; Subfamily lentivirinae; tripolyphosphate; Viral; Viral Pathogenesis; Viral Physiology; Viral Proteins; Viral reservoir; Virus; Virus Integration; Virus Replication; Work; ","SAMHD1 controls dNTP pool and HIV sensitivity to NRTIs","104198","ADDT","AIDS Discovery and Development of Therapeutics Study Section ","","","07","199500","111720","311220",""

Significant genetic and clinical evidence shows that a primary determinant in defining pathologic distal protein aggregation critical for disease pathogenesis is the secretio of destabilized, amyloidogenic proteins from the site of synthesis. Here, we show that activation of endogenous stress-responsive signaling pathways that regulate protein secretion through the secretory pathway is a broadly-applicable therapeutic strategy to selectively reduce secretion of destabilized, amyloidogenic proteins, decrease serum concentrations of amyloidogenic protein available for aggregation, and attenuate pathologic protein aggregation associated with multiple systemic amyloid disorders.","7892111; 8499129 (contact); ","MURPHY, GEORGE J; WISEMAN, ROCKLAND L (contact);","RASOOLY, REBEKAH S","09/08/2014","06/30/2018","Affect; Amyloid; Amyloid Fibrils; Amyloidosis; Animal Model; Apolipoprotein A-I; Attenuated; Biological Assay; Cell model; Cells; Clinic; Clinical; Deposition; Disease; Disease model; Dissociation; Distal; Economics; extracellular; Extracellular Protein; Gel Chromatography; Genetic; Goals; Hepatic; high throughput screening; human disease; improved; Individual; induced pluripotent stem cell; Ligands; Light-Chain Immunoglobulins; Liver; liver transplantation; Mammalian Cell; Measures; Medical; misfolded protein; Modeling; mutant; novel; Outcome; outcome forecast; Pathogenesis; Pathologic; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Patients; Peripheral; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Prealbumin; primary amyloidosis of light chain type; protein aggregation; Protein Biosynthesis; Protein Secretion; Proteins; Proteome; proteotoxicity; public health relevance; Publishing; Resources; response; Serum; Signal Pathway; Site; small molecule; Stress; System; Therapeutic; Tissues; transcription factor; Translating; Transplant Recipients; ","TARGETING ENDOGENOUS SIGNALING PATHWAYS TO AMELIORATE SYSTEMIC AMYLOIDOSES","102635","HBPP","Hepatobiliary Pathophysiology Study Section ","","","04","150000","50639","200639",""

This proposal seeks to conduct a series of in vivo studies, informed by FDA guidelines, to advance cartilage tissue engineering toward regeneration of large defects on articular surfaces. Core innovations include 1) developing biomimetic cartilage, engineered via a self-assembling process, for articular cartilage resurfacing of the patella to address the patellofemoral indication, 2) incorporating small and large animal models, 3) employing potent stimuli to not only render large neocartilage constructs mechanically robust but also exhibiting ability to integrate within defects, and 4) basing studies on FDA guidance recommendations. Conducted under Good Laboratory Practice (GLP), the successful completion of this proposal will lay a solid foundation for subsequent clinical studies.","2091499; ","ATHANASIOU, KYRIACOS A;","WANG, FEI ","06/01/2015","05/31/2020","Address; Allogenic; Animal Model; Animals; Arthroscopy; articular cartilage; Autologous; Autopsy; base; Biochemical; Biochemistry; Biology; Biomechanics; Biomimetics; bone; Cartilage; Cartilage injury; cartilage regeneration; Cell Count; Cells; Chondrocytes; Chondroitinases; Clinical Research; clinically translatable; Collagen; Complex; crosslink; Cyanoacrylates; Data; Defect; design; dosage; Dose; Effectiveness; Engineering; Ensure; Evaluation; Exhibits; Foundations; Friction; Glues; good laboratory practice; Grant; Guidelines; healing; Histology; Human; Hydrostatic Pressure; Immune response; Implant; implantation; improved; improved functioning; In Vitro; in vivo; indexing; innovation; insight; interfacial; Knee; Knee bone; knee replacement arthroplasty; Lateral; Link; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Mechanics; Medial; Methods; Modeling; Morphology; mouse model; Mus; Natural regeneration; novel strategies; Oryctolagus cuniculus; osteochondral tissue; Phase; Phenotype; pre-clinical; Preparation; Process; Property; Protein-Lysine 6-Oxidase; Protocols documentation; public health relevance; Publications; Recommendation; repaired; research clinical testing; response; Safety; sample fixation; scaffold; scale up; Series; Serologic tests; Sheep; Solid; Stimulus; success; Surface; Surgical sutures; synergism; systemic toxicity; Technology; Testing; Tissue Engineering; Tissues; United States National Institutes of Health; Validation; Work; ","Self-assembling process in tissue engineering of articular cartilage","067821","MTE","Musculoskeletal Tissue Engineering Study Section ","","S1","03","43961","17204","61165",""

Here we will test whether HSF1 inactivity and HSP90 induction contribute to liver stellate cell activation and fibrosis. On the other hand we propose that induction of HSF1 and HSPA1A/HSP70 contributes to resolution of fibrosis. Preclinical HSP90 inhibitor could be used to reduce fibrosis by reversing stellate cell activation. Inhibition of HSP90 using 17-DMAG increases HSF1 activity and induces target genes, such as HSPA1A/HSP70, reducing HSC activation and, resolution of liver fibrosis. Exploring the significance of HSF1-HSPA1A/HSP70 axis in stellate cell activation will provide further knowledge of an important role for proteostasis regulators in resolution of fibrosis. Using translational and targeted plasmid-delivery approaches in vivo as well as cell-specific knock-out mice we propose to uncover the therapeutic potential of HSPs in liver fibrosis. Understanding HSP regulated pathways will further identify novel mechanisms and extend our knowledge of the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis.","6624700; ","MANDREKAR, PRANOTI ;","OROSZ, ANDRAS ","07/20/2017","03/31/2022","Alcohols; biological adaptation to stress; Candidate Disease Gene; Cell physiology; Cells; Cellular Stress; Chronic; Cirrhosis; Clinical; Collagen Type I; cytokine; Data; Dependence; design; Development; effective therapy; Endoplasmic Reticulum; Exposure to; Extracellular Matrix; Fibroblasts; fibrogenesis; Fibrosis; Gene Targeting; global health; Heat shock proteins; Heat-Shock Proteins 70; Heat-Shock Proteins 90; Hepatic Stellate Cell; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis C; HSF1; HSP 90 inhibition; In Vitro; in vivo; Inflammation; Inflammatory; inhibitor/antagonist; Injury; Investigation; Knock-out; Knockout Mice; Knowledge; Link; Liver; Liver Fibrosis; Mediating; Modeling; Molecular Chaperones; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Myofibroblast; nanoparticle; Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; novel; Obesity; overexpression; Oxidative Stress; Oxidative Stress Pathway; Pathogenesis; Pathogenicity; Pathway interactions; Plasmids; Play; pre-clinical; Primary carcinoma of the liver cells; Process; Property; Proteins; proteostasis; proteotoxicity; public health relevance; Recovery; Regulation; Reporting; Resolution; response; Role; Signal Transduction; stellate cell; Stimulus; Stress; Testing; Therapeutic; transcription factor; Viral hepatitis; Wound Healing; ","Targeting proteotoxic stress responses in liver fibrosis","025289","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","01","234846","154913","389759",""

Drawing on accumulating evidence of cerebellar dysfunction in schizophrenia, as well as evidence of the cerebellum?s role in a very similar process in the domain of motor control, I will explore whether the cerebellum is involved in predictive coding, and whether cerebellar abnormalities are associated with predictive coding dysfunction in individuals with schizophrenia, with results potentially contributing to a better understanding of the dysfunctional neural processes that contribute to symptoms of schizophrenia.","14305848; ","KENT, JERILLYN ;","CHAVEZ, MARK ","07/01/2017","06/30/2020","Accounting; Affective; Anatomy; Area; Attenuated; Behavior; behavior measurement; Behavior Therapy; Behavioral; behavioral impairment; Brain; Cerebellar Diseases; Cerebellum; Code; Cognition; Cognitive; Contralateral; Data; Delusions; Disease; Disease model; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology (science); Employee Strikes; Evolution; experience; Failure; Feeling; Fingers; Functional disorder; Generations; Hallucinations; Individual; Influentials; Investigation; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Measures; Modeling; Motor; motor control; Movement; MRI Scans; neuroimaging; neuromechanism; neuronal excitability; neurophysiology; novel; Output; Patients; Perception; Performance; Pharmacology; Posture; Process; Public Health; relating to nervous system; Reporting; Research; response; Role; Schizophrenia; Sensory; simulation; somatosensory; Source; Speech; Statistical Models; Symptoms; System; Testing; Theoretical model; theories; Thinking; Time; Travel; Work; ","Investigating the role of cerebellar abnormalities in dysfunctional predictive coding in individuals with schizophrenia","112334","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","01","61566","","61566",""

To this end, this proposal seeks to understand the origin and mechanisms of activation of liver progenitor cells (LPCs), which expand in patients with chronic liver disease and are thought to mediate liver regeneration when endogenous hepatocyte proliferation is impaired.

Project Narrative. The understanding of primary and secondary metabolic pathways in bacteria plays a dual role for human health by serving as therapeutic targets (primary metabolism) and also as a template for drug discovery (secondary metabolism). While molecular methods to study living systems have advanced significantly in recent years, our ability to access the wealth of metabolic systems in microbes is starkly limited because most microbial species cannot be addressed in the laboratory. This program explores a new `high risk / high reward' approach to uncover features of microbial metabolism by probing at the single microbial cell level. In this application the UC San Diego team begins by exploring the development of optimized fluorescent probes that are used to detect positive enzyme activity, namely phosphopantetheinyltransferase (PPTase), within microbial cells. Next the team then applies synthetic PPTase inhibitors as feedback tools to properly validate the identified microbial species. During this development phase, concurrent efforts at Bigelow Laboratory explore the development and optimization of fluorescently labeled microbes. Once complete, the teams will unite to explore the convergence of these tools to identify novel PPTase enzymes from microbial species present in seawater collected by the Bigelow Laboratory. While marine microbes are known to offer a diversity of PPTases to regulate biosynthetic processes, the majority of marine PPTases have yet to be discovered, and hence they offer an ideal starting point to test this new approach to enzyme and biosynthetic discovery. Overall, this program provides an important step for combining in vivo screening and whole genome sequencing. We have identified a realizable path to rapidly select and address organisms without culturing. Currently, the ability to develop new antibiotics and antibiotic targets has been limited by the culture of specific organisms. The methods described here are not limited to PPTases ? indeed this workflow can be broadly implemented to rapidly screen, identify and characterize new biosynthetic functions at the single cell level using other targets. We anticipate this tool will have an immediate impact for a wide array of applications in the microbial field, and hence presents a valuable advance toward understanding of and treatment of infectious disease.","6272585 (contact); 8560633; ","BURKART, MICHAEL D.

Without established norms identified with developmentally sensitive methods, it is difficult to distinguish mild, normative behaviors from risk for persistent, impairing emotional and behavior problems. Therefore, the present study will implement a multi-level approach to document the spectrum of anxiety and mood dysregulation in a sample of 3-5-year-old children to generate developmentally meaningful distinctions between normative individual differences and clinically-significant patterns of behavior, family environment, and stress physiology, and inform identification and intervention to reduce the negative long-term effects of early-emerging internalizing psychopathology for children and their families.","9225777; ","BUFFERD, SARA J;","MURPHY, ERIC ROUSSEAU","05/12/2017","07/31/2019","5 year old; Academic Research Enhancement Awards; acute stress; Adult; Age; aged; Anxiety; Attention; base; Behavior; Behavioral; Biological; Biological Markers; C-reactive protein; Child; Child Behavior; Child Rearing; Chronic stress; Clinical; clinical risk; clinically significant; cytokine; Data; depressive symptoms; Development; diaries; Dimensions; Economic Burden; Emotional; emotional behavior; Environment; Ethnic Origin; experience; Exposure to; Family; Fathers; Frequencies; Fright; Goals; Hair; Hydrocortisone; hypothalamic pituitary axis; Impairment; Individual Differences; Inflammation; inflammatory marker; innovation; Institution; Intervention; Judgment; Knowledge; Long-Term Effects; Measures; Mental Depression; Mental disorders; Methods; Mission; Moods; Mothers; National Institute of Mental Health; Nature; novel; Nursery Schools; Parents; Pattern; phenomenological models; Phenotype; Physiological; Physiology; Preventive Intervention; Problem behavior; Process; Psychopathology; Psychophysiology; public health relevance; Race; Reporting; Research; Research Domain Criteria; Research Methodology; response; Risk Behaviors; Salivary; Sampling; satisfaction; Separation Anxiety; Severities; sex; social anxiety; Socioeconomic Status; Stress; stress reactivity; stressor; Students; Subgroup; Testing; theories; Variant; Work; ","Preschool Internalizing Psychopathology: Behavioral Phenotypes and Stress Physiology","106885","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1S1","01","8513","4171","12684",""
