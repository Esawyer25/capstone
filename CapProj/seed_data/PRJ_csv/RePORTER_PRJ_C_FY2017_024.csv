Catheter associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are important contributors to such infections, with estimates ranging from 40-60%. Women, those with strokes, the disabled and the elderly are particularly susceptible to CAUTIs. Polymer Exploration Group, PEG LLC is developing a new approach to greatly reduce the incidence of CAUTIs.

Recent studies in humans demonstrated a significant increase in risk of bone fracture increases in proliferation/migration of tumors in users of sustained opiates. This proposal addresses the use of a MAGL inhibitor in order to increase levels of endogenous 2AG while at the same time reducing the endogenous eicosanoids (i.e., prostaglandins) in a murine model of breast-induced bone cancer.

Whereas all fellows will receive training in core competencies of translational traumatic stress research, each fellow will select specialized training in one of two tracks - Epidemiology Risk and Resiliency (ERR) research or Treatment Development, Evaluation and Dissemination (TED) research. Training will be outlined in each fellow's Individualized Training Plan and guided by the fellow's selection of a Primary Mentor from among faculty at the National Crime Victims Research and Treatment Center (NCVC) and a Co-Mentor from among other MUSC faculty and additional academic institutions. Co-Mentors (MDs and PhDs) add great breadth to training opportunities through their complementary expertise in areas of translational or clinical science spanning behavioral genetics, neurobiology, neuroimaging, developmental psychopathology, child psychiatry, substance abuse, health services research, epidemiology and HIV prevention. Fellows also will benefit from a full array of core, selective and elective training options that include internationally-recognized researchers as guest speakers, formal coursework, workshops and seminars, training in the ethics of translational research and responsible conduct of research, multicultural and community-based research training, writing club, journal club, and career development retreats. The caliber of the training program is clearly reflected in the 24-year record of notable accomplishments and scientific contributions made by previous fellows. Of the 47 fellows supported in the past 10 years, 84% are either in training or employed full-time in scientific research, teaching or administration in traumatic-stress research relevant positions. Fellows from the past 10 years have already received 20 NIH grants, including 5 R01s and 4 K-Awards, in addition to numerous other federal and foundation grants, and in total have produced 833 publications. A primary strength of the training fellowship, which drives its ability to recruit the highest caliber candidates, is the thrving programs of research at the NCVC that include a number of ongoing, federally-funded projects encompassing national epidemiological studies of exposure to traumatic stressors and risk of mental health disorders, gene-environment interaction (GxE) studies of resilience following exposure to disasters, treatment development and randomized clinical trials (RCTs), and projects addressing translation of effective treatments to clinical practice.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Traumatic stress is a well-documented risk factor for a range of mental health disorders that are both prevalent and costly to the person and society. For example, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other anxiety disorders that may extend from trauma exposure are estimated to cost ~$42 billion/yr with regard to healthcare utilization, psychiatric and other medical treatment, and daily living impairment (e.g., work productivity). This program integrates the latest findings and concepts in (1) epidemiologic risk and resilience and (2) treatment development, evaluation and dissemination research with core training in methodology, ethics, career development and multicultural research.

To compensate for reduced blood flow, hypoxia promotes new blood vessel formation (i.e. angiogenesis), a process requiring vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells. This project serves to identify the biochemical signals in smooth muscle cells that promote angiogenesis and results from these investigations therefore aim to advance novel therapies for the treatment of hypoxia-induced vascular insufficiencies associated with coronary, peripheral and cerebral arterial diseases.","1875477 (contact); 1867657; ","PROWELLER, AARON  (contact); RAMIREZ-BERGERON, DIANA L;","OLIVE, MICHELLE ","06/01/2016","02/29/2020","3-Dimensional; angiogenesis; Angiogenic Factor; animal tissue; Animals; ARNT gene; Atherosclerosis; Behavior; Binding; Biochemical; Biological; Biological Assay; Blood; Blood flow; blood vessel development; Blood Vessels; Cardiovascular system; cell behavior; Cell Communication; Cell Hypoxia; cell type; Cells; Cerebral Arterial Diseases; Cerebrum; chromatin immunoprecipitation; Co-Immunoprecipitations; Coculture Techniques; combinatorial; Complex; Coronary; Data; Dependence; Dermal; Development; Disease; DNA; Endothelial Cells; Equilibrium; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profile; gene function; Generations; Genetic; Growth Factor; Health; HIF1A gene; Hypoxemia; Hypoxia; Hypoxia Inducible Factor; hypoxia inducible factor 1; Hypoxia-Inducible Factor Pathway; In Vitro; in vivo; Investigation; Ischemia; Laboratories; Ligands; Limb structure; Link; Luciferases; Measures; Methods; Modeling; Molecular; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; mouse model; Mus; mutant; MYH11 gene; Myocardial Infarction; neovasculature; notch protein; novel; novel therapeutics; Organ; Oxygen; paracrine; Pathologic Neovascularization; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Pericytes; Peripheral; Phenotype; Physiologic Neovascularization; Physiological; Process; Production; programs; promoter; protein protein interaction; Proteins; Protocols documentation; receptor; Reporter; response; retinal angiogenesis; Retinal Diseases; Risk; Role; sensor; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Smooth Muscle; Smooth Muscle Myocytes; Stress; stroke; synergism; System; Testing; Therapeutic; Tissues; transmission process; Vascular Diseases; Vascular Endothelial Cell; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors; Vascular Smooth Muscle; wound; ","Mechanisms of hypoxia-induced angiogenic control by vascular smooth muscle","128281","VCMB","Vascular Cell and Molecular Biology Study Section ","","","02","323443","189214","512657",""

We plan to test the combination in MPNST patients in a phase 2 study to demonstrate clinical benefit, inhibition of target kinases and macrophage infiltration within tumor biopsies in hopes that a positive finding of this trial will provide for the first time a treatment option in this aggressively fatal disease.","14388991 (contact); 1891505; ","MANJI, GULAM ABBAS (contact); SCHWARTZ, GARY K;","","03/05/2017","02/28/2021","","Phase 2 study of combination therapy with PLX3397 and sirolimus to target tumor-associated macrophages in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors","005745","ZFD1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","","","500000",""

We therefore propose to deploy the novel technologies we have developed in the past several years, in a long-term study aiming to establish that optimal balance between AP system complexity and benefits to the patient is achieved by a system that automatically takes over a person's blood glucose control in the evening and then stabilizes and 'resets' blood glucose levels to normal by the morning. Such an approach follows the natural wake-sleep circadian cycle, takes advantage of overnight steady-state glucose levels, and is proven with our current technology.","2229157; ","KOVATCHEV, BORIS P.;","ARREAZA-RUBIN, GUILLERMO ","09/28/2009","02/28/2019","Address; Advocate; Algorithms; Artificial Pancreas; base; Blood Glucose; blood glucose regulation; Bolus Infusion; Cellular Phone; Circadian Rhythms; Clinical; Clinical Trials; Companions; Cross-Over Trials; Data; design; Deterioration; Devices; Diabetes Mellitus; diabetes mellitus therapy; digital; Ecosystem; efficacy testing; Engineering; engineering design; Enrollment; Equilibrium; Europe; Exercise; Focus Groups; Fright; Future; Genetic Crossing Over; Glucose; glucose monitor; glycemic control; Glycosylated hemoglobin A; Goals; Group Interviews; Health; Hour; Hyperglycemia; Hypoglycemia; hypoglycemia unawareness; improved; Incidence; indexing; Inferior; Insulin Infusion Systems; Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; Interruption; Lead; Longitudinal Studies; Measures; Metabolic; Modality; Monitor; new technology; operation; Outcome; Outpatients; Participant; Patients; Persons; Pilot Projects; preference; prevent; Pump; Quality of life; Randomized; Recording of previous events; Research; research clinical testing; Research Design; Risk; Running; Safety; Scheme; sensor; Sleep; Slide; System; Technology; Testing; Therapeutic; Time; United States National Institutes of Health; Virginia; Work; ","Closed-Loop Control Modalities in Type 1 Diabetes: Efficacy and System Acceptance","085623","CIDO","Clinical and Integrative Diabetes and Obesity Study Section ","","","08","399517","231719","631236",""

We recently identified the retained metabolites in the sera of patients with CKD that enhance thrombosis. This project investigates the role of these pro-thrombotic metabolites and signaling pathway activated by them and how it influences the pathogenesis of thrombosis after vascular procedures. While elucidating the underlying mechanism, this project will examine both a potential biomarker to identify the CKD patients at risk of thrombosis and a novel drug target for uremic thrombosis, both of which will improve the anti-thrombotic therapeutics in CKD patients.","7897368; ","CHITALIA, VIPUL C;","KINDZELSKI, ANDREI L.","03/16/2016","02/28/2020","Abate; Acetates; Alteplase; Angioplasty; Angioplasty, Transluminal, Percutaneous Coronary; Animal Model; Animals; Antiplatelet Drugs; Area; Arteries; Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor; Asses; Balloon Angioplasty; base; Beds; Binding; Binding Proteins; Biological Markers; Biology; Biometry; Blood Platelets; Blood Vessels; Cardiovascular Manifestation; Cardiovascular system; Chronic Kidney Failure; Clinical; Clinical Research; Coagulation Process; cohort; Complication; Data; Development; Dialysis procedure; Elements; Endothelial Cells; Environment; Epidemiologist; Event; Exhibits; experience; ferric chloride; Fibrinolytic Agents; Framingham Heart Study; Genetic Transcription; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Health; Health system; High Prevalence; high risk; Human; improved; in vivo; Indican; indoxyl; Injury; interdisciplinary approach; Intervention; Knock-out; LacZ Genes; Life; Logistic Regressions; Mediator of activation protein; Modeling; Molecular; Mus; Myocardial Infarction; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; Nature; Nephritis; Nephrotoxic; new therapeutic target; non-compliance; novel; novel marker; Nuclear Translocation; Outcome; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Physicians; Population; potential biomarker; predictive marker; Procedures; Property; Proteins; Public Health; randomized trial; Receiver Operating Characteristics; Receptor Activation; receptor binding; Receptor Inhibition; Receptor Signaling; Regression Analysis; Regulation; Reporting; Research; Research Personnel; Risk; Risk Factors; Risk Marker; Role; Sampling; Scientist; Sensitivity and Specificity; Serum; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Smooth Muscle Myocytes; solute; Staging; stent thrombosis; Therapeutic; therapeutic target; thrombolysis; Thromboplastin; Thrombosis; Thrombus; Time; Toxin; Transgenic Animals; Tryptophan; ubiquitin-protein ligase; Ubiquitination; Uremia; Vascular Smooth Muscle; Venous; Work; Xenobiotics; ","Thrombotic complication of uremia: role of prothrombotic uremic solutes","132325","PBKD","Pathobiology of Kidney Disease Study Section ","","","02","250000","185000","435000",""

The personal, social, and medical burden of POAG within the VHA remains an extraordinarily significant health care concern. POAG is associated with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), which can lead to irreversible blindness. Current treatment options are limited to non-specific interventions, which remain refractory in some Veterans. Pharmacological application of siRNA technology as a therapy for a variety of ocular disorders has made significant advancements in recent years, and is now not only realistic but highly feasible. We demonstrate in this application that inhibition of Rho GTPase signaling significantly attenuates content of both TGF-2 and ET-1, two known mediators of elevated IOP. In this study, we will determine whether siRNA- mediated Rho GTPase knockdown can be utilized as a viable strategy for the management of elevated IOP by disrupting TGF-2 and ET-1 expression and signaling.","1909014; ","STUBBS, EVAN B.;","","03/01/2015","05/31/2017","Actins; Affect; Age; Age-Years; Anterior; Aqueous Humor; Attenuated; Blindness; Caring; Cells; Confocal Microscopy; cytokine; Deposition; Development; Disease; Dose; Employee Strikes; Endothelin-1; Equilibrium; Extracellular Matrix; Eye; Family suidae; Glaucoma; Goals; Guanosine Triphosphate Phosphohydrolases; Healthcare; Human; Immunohistochemistry; improved; Individual; Intervention; knock-down; Laboratories; Lead; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; Medical; novel; novel strategies; Operative Surgical Procedures; palliative; Pathologic; Patients; Perfusion; Physiologic Intraocular Pressure; Prevalence; prevent; Primary Open Angle Glaucoma; Production; proendothelin 1; public health relevance; Publishing; Publishing Peer Reviews; Refractory; Rehabilitation therapy; Reporting; Resistance; rho GTP-Binding Proteins; Risk Factors; Signal Transduction; Small Interfering RNA; social; socioeconomics; Source; Stress Fibers; targeted treatment; Technology; Testing; Therapeutic; Time; Trabecular meshwork structure; Transforming Growth Factor Beta 2; translational study; Vasoconstrictor Agents; Veterans; ","Rho GTPase siRNA as a Therapeutic Strategy in Regulating Outflow Resistance","001593","RRDS","Rehabilitation Research and Development SPiRE Program ","","","03","","","",""

Prior to 2013, outbreaks of this infection involved small numbers of individuals and were short-lived. The epidemic of 2013-16 devastated West Africa and set off a global public health crisis. Despite the magnitude and duration of this latest outbreak, relatively little new information about Ebola emerged. What is clear is that: a) most survivors continue to have residual symptoms related to their acute infection, and b) many survivors have Ebola RNA detected in their genital fluid. We seek to better understand Ebola convalescence including characterization of the symptomatology of post-Ebola conditions over time, and the drivers of these symptoms ? including the role of viral antigen persistence. Our work is intended to inform approaches to the clinical management of post-Ebola sequelae. We will also have an opportunity to examine carefully the dynamics of Ebola RNA persistence in the genital tracts of men and women who survived Ebola disease, including patterns and duration of detection, and this is expected to guide future public health considerations.","10121505; 2044107 (contact); ","FISCHER, WILLIAM ; WOHL, DAVID A (contact);","REPIK, PATRICIA M.","03/06/2017","02/28/2022","Activities of Daily Living; Acute; Address; Africa; Age; Area; base; Blood; Caring; CCL4 gene; Cervical; Cessation of life; Characteristics; Clinical; Clinical Management; Clinical Research; co-infection; cohort; Collaborations; Communicable Diseases; Complex; Convalescence; Data; Data Collection; Detection; Disease; Disease Outbreaks; Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever; Ebola virus; Enrollment; Ensure; Epidemic; Event; Foundations; Frequencies; Fright; Future; Gender; Genital system; Genitourinary system; Goals; Health; Healthcare; Healthcare Systems; Immune; immune activation; Immune response; Immunity; Immunology; Impairment; improved; Individual; Infection; Inflammation; Inflammatory; inflammatory marker; inflammatory milieu; Intestines; Knowledge; Liberia; Life; Liquid substance; Medical History; men; microbial; multidisciplinary; Musculoskeletal; Natural History; Neurologic; Participant; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Pattern; Physical Examination; Positioning Attribute; Prevalence; Procedures; Process; Public Health; public health emergency; Quality Control; Recovery; Recruitment Activity; Recurrence; Reporting; reproductive tract; Research Infrastructure; Research Methodology; Research Personnel; Residual state; Risk; RNA; Role; Sampling; Seminal fluid; Severity of illness; sex; Sierra Leone; Signal Transduction; Site; Survivors; survivorship; symptomatology; Symptoms; Syndrome; Therapeutic; Time; Tissues; Training; vaginal fluid; Viral; Viral Antigens; viral RNA; Viremia; Virus; Virus Diseases; Virus Replication; Woman; Work; World Health Organization; ","Clinical Sequelae and Urogenital Viral Dynamics in Survivors of Ebola Virus Disease","123535","IRAP","Infectious Diseases, Reproductive Health, Asthma and Pulmonary Conditions Study Section ","","A1","01","574922","90525","665447",""

Several lines of evidence suggest that the development of chronic inflammation, particularly in the setting of obesity, is a major driving force in the pathogenesis of the disease by promoting peripheral insulin resistance in tissues such as the liver; however, the precise mechanisms that mediate this process are not completely understood. Preliminary studies in our lab suggest that TRAF3, a protein important in immune regulation, may promote hepatic insulin resistance and this proposal seeks to further understand its role in metabolic disorders, which may facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies for diseases such as type 2 diabetes.","11195098; ","JIMENEZ-CANET, MARK ;","CASTLE, ARTHUR ","09/01/2016","08/31/2018","abstracting; Adaptor Signaling Protein; adenoviral-mediated; Adenoviruses; Affect; Affinity; American; Analytical Chemistry; Antibodies; Area; base; Biological Assay; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cause of Death; Cells; chromatin immunoprecipitation; Chronic; Complex; cytokine; Cytokine Signaling; Data; Development; diabetic patient; Disease; Disease Progression; driving force; Epidemic; Functional disorder; functional outcomes; Future; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetic; Glucagon; Health; Hepatic; Hepatocyte; High Fat Diet; high risk; Hyperglycemia; Immune; In Vitro; in vivo; Individual; Inflammation; Inflammation Mediators; Inflammatory; Insulin; Insulin Receptor; insulin receptor substrate 1 protein; Insulin Resistance; insulin sensitivity; insulin signaling; Interleukin-6; IRS1 gene; IRS2 gene; Laboratories; Leptin; Link; Lipopolysaccharides; Liver; Lysine; Mass Spectrum Analysis; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; member; Metabolic; Metabolic Diseases; Molecular; Molecular Biology; mouse model; Mouse Strains; Mus; mutant; Myelogenous; new therapeutic target; Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; Nonesterified Fatty Acids; novel; novel strategies; novel therapeutics; Obesity; overexpression; Pathogenesis; Peripheral; Physiological; Plasmids; Population; Prevalence; Process; protein expression; Protein Family; Proteins; Proteomics; Regimen; Regulation; Reporting; Research; response; Risk; Role; Scientific Advances and Accomplishments; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Signal Transduction Pathway; Site; Techniques; Testing; Tissues; TLR4 gene; TNF gene; TNF receptor-associated factor 3; TNF Receptor-Associated Factors; TNFRSF1A gene; TRAF2 gene; transcription factor; Transcription Factor AP-1; Transgenic Mice; treatment strategy; Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor; Tyrosine Phosphorylation; ubiquitin ligase; ubiquitin-protein ligase; Ubiquitination; Up-Regulation; Western Blotting; Work; ","Hepatic TNF Receptor Associated Factor (TRAF) 3 Promotes Insulin Resistance through the Ubiquitination of Insulin Receptor Substrate (IRS) 1 and 2","108531","ZDK1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1S1","01","1800","","1800",""

Sixty-six percent of adults in the target area do not have a bachelor's degree, and 11% do not have a high school diploma. This rate is 2% higher than for Montana, and 10% higher than that of the nation. These data suggest that students in the target area are not likely to attend college. American Indians account for approximately 6.3% of the population in Montana, which is significantly higher than the national average of 0.9%. The target area schools include American Indian student populations representative of the state figure. The BRIC project provides positive scientist role models and near-peer mentoring along with development of teachers' ability to deliver rigorous science curriculum.

It is the fifth most common cause of pediatric hospitalization and, cumulatively, the most costly among infants and children. Currently there is no single test available that can distinguish between the >10 pathogens that cause CAP. The objective of this prospective cohort study is to determine distinct metabolite profile for major classes of pathogens that cause CAP in children (e.g. virus, typical and atypical bacteria). Urine and blood samples will be collected from children diagnosed with CAP in the Emergency Department or who are hospitalized at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. Urine from children whose PCR tests are positive for a virus, typical bacteria or atypical bacteria will be sex and aged-matched to control samples. All urine samples will then be evaluated using quantitative 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance. Advanced statistical methods will be applied to the identified metabolite dataset to determine unique metabolite profiles. These profiles will be used as the foundation for future studies in the diagnostic capabilities of 1H-NMR for pathogen identification in children diagnosed with CAP. In addition, the concepts learned through this grant, as well as the career development pursued by the investigator, will be readily applicable to diagnostic testing for multiple infectious diseases.","10107031; ","AMBROGGIO, LILLIAM ;","LU, KRISTINA ","03/07/2017","02/28/2022","11 year old; Accident and Emergency department; accurate diagnosis; Active Learning; Address; Adult; Advanced Development; Age; aged; Antibiotic Therapy; Antibiotics; antimicrobial; Appointment; Award; Bacteria; Bacterial Infections; Bacterial Pneumonia; biobank; Biological; Biometry; Blood; Blood specimen; career; career development; Child; Childhood; Clinical; Clinical Data; clinical decision-making; Clinical Management; clinical phenotype; clinical practice; Clostridium difficile; cohort; Cohort Studies; Colitis; Collaborations; Communicable Diseases; Communities; Culture Techniques; Data; Data Set; Databases; Development; Development Plans; Diagnosis; Diagnostic; diagnostic accuracy; Diagnostic tests; Disease Management; Doctor of Pharmacy; Doctor of Philosophy; Education; Educational workshop; Emergency Medicine; Enrollment; Ensure; Environment; Epidemiologist; Epidemiology; Etiology; Evaluation; Faculty; Fellowship; Foundations; Funding; Future; Goals; Grant; Hospitalization; Hospitals; Hour; improved; improved outcome; Infant; Infection; Infectious Disease Epidemiology; innovation; inpatient service; Institution; Joints; K-Series Research Career Programs; Knowledge; Leadership; Learning; Lung; Medical center; Medicine; meetings; member; Mentors; metabolic profile; metabolome; metabolomics; metabolomics resource; Methodology; Methods; Michigan; microbial; Molecular and Cellular Biology; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Multicenter Studies; Mycoplasma pneumoniae; Nasopharynx; novel; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance; pathogen; Pathogen detection; patient population; Patients; Pattern; Pediatric Hospitals; Pediatrics; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pneumonia; point-of-care diagnostics; Population; Postdoctoral Fellow; professor; prospective; Public Health; Reaction; Research; Research Activity; Research Design; Research Infrastructure; Research Personnel; Research Training; Resources; response; Risk; Sampling; Science; sex; skills; small molecule; Smoking; Source; Specimen; Sputum; Statistical Methods; Streptococcus pneumoniae; Structure; success; Systems Biology; Techniques; Testing; Thoracic Radiography; Time; tool; Training; Training Activity; Translating; Universities; Urine; validation studies; Variant; Viral; Viral Pneumonia; Virus; Work; ","Metabolomics Evaluation of the Etiology of Pneumonia","125413","MID","Microbiology and Infectious Diseases B Subcommittee ","","A1","01","118750","9500","128250",""

Chronic kidney diseases (CKD) take one of the highest tolls on human health, requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation for survival. In the first 2 decades of life ~50% of CKD is caused by Congenital Anomalies of the Kidney and Urinary Tract (CAKUT). However, very little is known about the etiology and pathogenesis of CAKUT. No curative treatment or prophy- laxis is available. Using high-throughput sequencing techniques we and others showed recently that at least 10% of all forms of CAKUT can be attributed to single-gene defects in two dozen different genes. Our data demonstrate that there are several dozen additional single-gene causes of CAKUT yet to be identified, and that gene identification allows insights into the mechanisms by which CAKUT arises. We propose here to: 1. Identify novel full-penetrance recessive causes of CAKUT by genetic mapping and whole  exome sequencing in 140 families. 2. Identify novel causes of CAKUT by high-throughput candidate gene analysis and study  genotype-phenotype correlations in large molecularly defined cohorts. 3. Delineate disease mechanisms of CAKUT by further characterizing genetic defects of the newly  implicated SLIT2-ROBO2-SRGAP1 and TBX18-THSZ3 pathways. Gene identification will allow delineation of disease mechanisms in CAKUT, which may then be addressed for prevention of this predominant cause of early-onset CKD.","7334807; ","HILDEBRANDT, FRIEDHELM ;","RASOOLY, REBEKAH S","07/05/2010","02/29/2020","Address; base; Candidate Disease Gene; Cells; Chromosome Mapping; Chronic Kidney Failure; cohort; Congenital Abnormality; congenital anomaly; curative treatments; Data; Developmental Gene; Dialysis procedure; Disease; early onset; Etiology; exome sequencing; Exons; Family; Gene Mutation; Genes; Genets; Genotype; GRIP1 gene; Health; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Human; India; insight; Kidney; Kidney Transplantation; kohl; Kuwait; Lead; Life; Maps; Methods; mouse model; mutant; Mutate; Mutation; novel; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Penetrance; Phenotype; Prevention; Prophylactic treatment; research study; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Single-Gene Defect; Smooth Muscle; System; Techniques; Urinary tract; Xenopus; ","New genes and pathomechanisms of congenital abnormalities of the kidney (CAKUT)","088767","KMBD","Kidney Molecular Biology and Genitourinary Organ Development ","","","08","202500","155925","358425",""

The development of targeted therapy against this deadly disease remains a great medical challenge, and clinical efforts are directed to reduce the mortality rate. A major hallmark of ALI/ARDS patients is reported to be platelet derived neutrophil dysfunction that lead to endothelial damage. The proposed dissection of the molecular mechanisms of AL/ARDS through the abundant platelet receptor known as Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM) like transcript 1 (TLT-1) is expected to significantly advance the current understanding of platelet modulation of immune response during inflammation while opening the door for new therapeutic approaches for this deadly disease.","11302514; ","MORALES-ORTIZ, JESSICA ;","COLOMBINI-HATCH, SANDRA ","01/13/2017","05/12/2019","Accounting; Actins; Acute; Acute Lung Injury; Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome; Alpha Granule; alternative treatment; Alveolitis; Antibodies; Attenuated; base; Binding; Biological Process; Blood; Blood Platelets; Cell Communication; Cells; Clinical; Clinical Trials; controlled release; Coronary Arteriosclerosis; cost; Cytoplasmic Granules; Data; Development; Disease; Dissection; economic impact; Edema; empowered; Endothelial Cells; Endothelium; Evaluation; Exhibits; Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate; Functional disorder; Healthcare; Hemorrhage; Hemostatic Agents; Hemostatic function; Immune response; Immune system; in vivo; Incubated; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Inflammatory Response; interest; Knockout Mice; Knowledge; Label; Laboratory Study; Lead; Leukocytes; Life; Link; Lipopolysaccharides; Lung; Lung diseases; Lung Inflammation; Maintenance; Mediating; Mediation; Medical; Megakaryocytes; Membrane; Modeling; Molecular; mortality; mouse model; Mus; Myeloid Cells; neutrophil; novel therapeutic intervention; novel therapeutics; P-Selectin; Pathology; Patients; Phenotype; polymerization; prevent; Property; Proteins; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Publishing; Pulmonary Edema; Reaction; receptor; Recombinants; Reporting; Research; Respiratory Failure; response; Role; Selectins; Sepsis; Signal Transduction; Site; targeted treatment; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Effect; tool; Transcript; Trauma; Vasculitis; Work; ","The Evaluation of TLT-1 as treatment for ALI/ARDS","136183","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","29236","","29236",""

Here we propose to investigate the role of brain insulin in the control of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism, and the results from the proposed studies will reveal how central insulin physiologically regulates BCAA metabolism and that this is impaired in obese and diabetic individuals. Importantly, applying the gained knowledge to examine the mechanisms by which bariatric surgery improves BCAA metabolism will ultimately facilitate development of non-invasive treatment options that mimic RYGB effects to fight obesity and diabetes.","10487361; ","SHIN, ANDREW CHANGHUN;","SPAIN, LISA M","08/01/2013","05/31/2017","","Role of brain insulin in the regulation of branched-chain amino acid metabolism","099463","ZDK1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","05","86718","6937","93655",""

We propose to identify key relationships among these problem behaviors and measures of brain reward circuitry function in help-seeking and non help-seeking 18-25 year-olds, to help us identify biological measures that can predict future outcome, and ultimately pave the way for the development of better treatments for vulnerable young people with mental health problems.","8348725; ","PHILLIPS, MARY LOUISE;","MORRIS, SARAH E","03/01/2014","02/28/2019","Accident and Emergency department; Adult; Affect; Affective; Age; Ambulatory Care; Anhedonia; Antidepressive Agents; Anxiety; anxiety symptoms; Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; base; Behavior; Behavioral; Biological; Brain; Categories; Childhood; Clinical; coping; Counseling; critical developmental period; Demographic Aging; Dependence; depressive symptoms; Development; Diagnosis; Diagnostic; Dimensions; Distress; emotion regulation; Esthesia; Ethnic Origin; experience; Face; Factor Analysis; Family; Family history of; Feeling suicidal; Functional disorder; functional outcomes; Funding; Future; Gender; Health; Health Professional; help-seeking behavior; Hospitalization; Individual; information processing; Institutes; Interpersonal Relations; Intervention; Lateral; Lead; Lifestyle-related condition; Measures; Medial; Mental disorders; Mental Health; Mood Disorders; neural circuit; Neurobiology; neuroimaging; novel; Outcome; Patient Self-Report; personalized medicine; Pharmaceutical Preparations; pleasure; Positive Valence; Prefrontal Cortex; Primary Health Care; Problem behavior; Professional counselor; programs; Psychiatrist; psychologic; psychological distress; psychosocial; Psychotherapy; Psychotic Disorders; Quality of life; Recording of previous events; Recruitment Activity; Research Domain Criteria; Rest; reward circuitry; reward expectancy; Rewards; Risk-Taking; Services; standardize measure; stressor; Students; Substance abuse problem; Symptoms; System; Training; trait; Trauma; treatment choice; two-dimensional; Ventral Striatum; Visit; white matter; willingness; young adult; Youth; ","Reward, pathophysiologic dimensions and psychological distress in young adults","100041","NPAS","Neural Basis of Psychopathology, Addictions and Sleep Disorders Study Section ","","","04","378809","169105","547914",""

In the proposed experiments, we will compare the physiology and communication, effects on neural transmission and behavior, and gene expression in vivo, of astrocytes generated from iPS cells derived from patients with schizophrenia, to those derived from normal controls.","2416456 (contact); 6486042; ","GOLDMAN, STEVEN ALAN (contact); NEDERGAARD, MAIKEN ;","PANCHISION, DAVID M","03/05/2013","02/28/2018","Address; Adolescent; Adult; Anatomy; Animal Model; Appearance; Architecture; astrocyte progenitor; Astrocytes; base; Behavior; Behavior Disorders; Behavioral; Behavioral Assay; Biological Models; Brain; Calcium Oscillations; cell type; Cells; Characteristics; Cognition; Communication; Creativeness; Databases; Development; Disease; Environment; Evolution; Functional disorder; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profile; Gene Expression Profiling; Generations; Health; Hip region structure; Hippocampus (Brain); Hominidae; Human; human disease; humanized mouse; in vivo; induced pluripotent stem cell; insight; Investigation; Kinetics; Life; Mental disorders; Messenger RNA; MicroRNAs; Modality; Modeling; Molecular Profiling; Morphology; mouse model; Mus; Nature; Neuroglia; neurophysiology; Neurophysiology - biologic function; new technology; paracrine; Pathogenesis; Pathology; Patients; Pattern; Phenotype; Phylogenetic Analysis; Physiological; Physiology; Population; progenitor; Protocols documentation; Protoplasmic Astrocyte; Psychopathology; Reagent; research study; response; Role; Schizophrenia; Slice; Sorting - Cell Movement; Stem cells; stressor; Suggestion; Synaptic plasticity; Synaptic Transmission; Technology; Time; tool; Toxic effect; transmission process; ","A Humanized Mouse Model of Astrocytic Pathology in Schizophrenia","099578","ZMH1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","05","336027","134994","471021",""

Adolescence/early adulthood is a critical period of brain development during which glutamate neurons establish their connectivity within forebrain structures subserving emotionality and motivated behavior. Current reports suggest that adolescent binge drinking can impact indices of forebrain maturation in humans, particularly in females. Thus, it is imperative that we understand how adolescent binge alcohol drinking interacts with sex to impact forebrain excitatory neurotransmission and the relevance of these changes for the development of affective disorders, which exhibit an unusually high rate of comorbidity with alcoholism. To this end, this project will employ a novel, but well-validated, murine model of binge alcohol drinking to disentangle the role for the subject factors of sex, age of binge drinking onset, and duration of alcohol abstinence, in the emotional disturbances and problem drinking characteristic of alcohol use disorders and co-morbidity between alcohol use and affective disorders.","7930277; ","SZUMLINSKI, KAREN KATHLEEN;","CUI, CHANGHAI ","03/03/2016","02/28/2021","Address; Adolescence; Adolescent; adolescent alcohol; Adolescent and Young Adult; adolescent binge drinking; Adult; Affect; Affective; Affective Symptoms; Age; Age of Onset; alcohol abstinence; Alcohol abuse; Alcohol consumption; alcohol exposure; alcohol use disorder; Alcohol withdrawal syndrome; Alcoholism; Alcohols; Amygdaloid structure; Anxiety; Behavior; Behavioral; binge drinker; binge drinking; Biochemical; Biological Assay; Brain; Cell Nucleus; Characteristics; Clinical; clinically relevant; Comorbidity; critical period; depressive symptoms; Development; Disease; drinking; drinking onset; drug abstinence; effective therapy; emerging adult; Emotional; Emotional Disturbance; Etiology; Exhibits; Exposure to; Female; Female Adolescents; Glutamate Receptor; Glutamates; Growth; Health; Heavy Drinking; High Prevalence; Human; Image; Immunoblotting; Incubated; indexing; Individual; Individual Differences; insight; Knowledge; Life; Life Experience; Link; male; Male Adolescents; Measures; Mental Depression; Molecular; Mood Disorders; motivated behavior; mouse model; Mus; negative affect; neural circuit; neuroadaptation; Neurobiology; neurodevelopment; Neuronal Plasticity; Neurons; neuropsychiatry; neurotransmission; novel; Pharmacotherapy; Prevalence; Procedures; Prosencephalon; psychiatric symptom; Receptor Signaling; Recording of previous events; relating to nervous system; Reporting; reproductive; Research; Role; Severities; Severity of illness; sex; Signaling Molecule; stressor; Structure; System; Testing; transmission process; United States; Withdrawal; Work; ","Adolescent Alcohol and Anxiety","024044","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","202500","99467","301967",""
