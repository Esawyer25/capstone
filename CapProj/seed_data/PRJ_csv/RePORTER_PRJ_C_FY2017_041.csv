Examples include hemoglobin, but there are many others, and heme proteins number in the hundreds. These proteins are necessary for storing and transporting oxygen; enabling cells to consume oxygen and to perform their usual metabolism; control of vascular function; detoxifying potentially toxic substances, among other functions. However, in multiple instances, these heme proteins can actually cause kidney and other diseases. A central and long-standing focus in kidney research has been how these heme proteins cause kidney disease, and how the kidney can protect itself against such injury. In prior cycles of this grant application evidence was generated that a special enzyme known as heme oxygenase-1 can defend the kidney and other tissues from these potentially damaging heme proteins and, indeed, these observations have led to interest in the therapeutic application of these findings. This renewal application extends this line of investigation to involve three proteins that are related to heme, heme proteins, and heme oxygenase-1, and each of which may exert protective functions in the kidney. These proteins include the heme-binding protein called hemopexin, another heme-degrading enzyme called heme oxygenase-2, and a third protein known as haptoglobin which binds hemoglobin, but is now known to be a potent antioxidant protein; haptoglobin is used in certain countries to treat severe hemolysis. These proposed studies may provide evidence and direction for new therapeutic treatments for human acute kidney injury.","1890747; ","NATH, KARL A.;","KIMMEL, PAUL ","08/01/1993","06/30/2019","Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis; Affinity; Agonist; Anti-inflammatory; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Anticoagulants; Antihypertensive Agents; Antioxidants; Apoptosis; Applications Grants; Attenuated; Behavior; Binding; Binding Proteins; Biological Markers; Blood Vessels; Carbon Monoxide; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cells; Chemical Structure; Cisplatin; Clinical; Clinical Research; Complex; Country; Data; Disease; Endotoxins; Enzymes; Epithelial Cells; exhibitions; Exhibits; extracellular; Funding; Genetic; Genotype; Glomerulonephritis; Haptoglobins; Heme; heme a; heme oxygenase-1; heme oxygenase-2; heme-binding protein; Hemeproteins; Hemoglobin; Hemolysis; Hemopexin; Human; human disease; Impairment; In Vitro; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Inflammatory Response; Inhibition of Cell Proliferation; Injury; interest; Interruption; Investigation; Ischemia; Kidney; Kidney Diseases; Liver; Mediating; Metabolism; Molecular; monocyte; Mus; mutant; Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1; NF-kappa B; novel; novel therapeutic intervention; novel therapeutics; oxidant stress; Oxygen; oxygen transport; Pathway interactions; Pattern; Plasma; Poisons; Predisposition; Property; protective effect; Protein Family; Proteins; public health relevance; Publishing; Reperfusion Therapy; Research; Resistance; response; Risk; Role; Signal Transduction; Supplementation; Testing; Therapeutic; Tissues; TLR4 gene; Tubular formation; Urine; Weibel-Palade Bodies; ","Renal Injury and Adaptation to Heme Proteins","047060","PBKD","Pathobiology of Kidney Disease Study Section ","","","24","217500","128325","345825",""

This proposal focuses on the development of an alternative, non-genetic, and reversible method for modifying T cell membranes for the purpose of anti-cancer therapy, potentially expanding the applications of adoptive T-cell treatments.

Multiple, complex pathologies have been implicated, including the RNA/DNA binding protein TDP-43's nucleus cytoplasm redistribution in a majority of both sporadic and inherited cases; however the molecular mechanisms of its pathology and/or physiological consequence(s) leading to neuronal death/dysfunction are still unknown. The project will establish that TDP-43 is a key component of DNA double strand break (DSB) machinery in neurons of healthy individuals and its loss of nuclear functions in ALS and other TDP-43-associated neurodegenerative diseases which include about 40% of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease affected patients, leads to deficient DSB repair. The resulting accumulation of lethal DSBs promotes neuronal toxicity and death. Thus this innovative grant proposal, based on strong preliminary data, will examine previously unexplored area of ALS research that would lead to a major paradigm shift in our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of not only ALS, but also other TDP-43-associated neurodegenerative diseases; and could open up new avenues of therapeutic interventions.","10223174; ","HEGDE, MURALIDHAR L;","GUBITZ, AMELIE ","07/01/2015","06/30/2020","Affect; Alzheimer's Disease; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Apoptosis; Applications Grants; Area; Autopsy; Binding; Biological Assay; Biological Models; Brain; brain tissue; Cell Death; Cell Line; Cell model; Cell Nucleus; Cell Survival; Cells; Chromatin; Collaborations; Complex; Cortical Cord; Cytoplasm; Data; Degenerative Disorder; Disease; Disease Progression; DNA; DNA Binding; DNA Damage; DNA Double Strand Break; DNA Ligases; DNA Repair; DNA Repair Disorder; DNA Repair Gene; DNA strand break; DNA-Binding Proteins; DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase; DNA-PKcs; Double Strand Break Repair; effective therapy; Etiology; Familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Family; Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations; Functional disorder; functional loss; G22P1 gene; Genome; Genomics; Germ-Line Mutation; Goals; Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins; Human; In Vitro; Individual; Inherited; innovation; Intervention; Investigation; Ku Protein; Lead; Link; Measures; Molecular; Motor; Motor Neurons; Mus; mutant; Mutant Strains Mice; Mutation; Nerve Degeneration; nerve stem cell; Neurodegenerative Disorders; neuron loss; Neurons; neurotoxicity; Nonhomologous DNA End Joining; novel; Nuclear; Parkinson Disease; Pathogenesis; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Patients; Physiological; Plasmids; Protein Family; Proteins; public health relevance; Reaction; reconstitution; Recruitment Activity; repaired; Research; response; RNA; RNA Processing; Role; Services; SIRT1 gene; Site; Source; Spinal; Spinal Cord; Testing; Therapeutic Intervention; Tissues; Toxic effect; Transact; Transgenic Mice; XRCC4 gene; ","Etiological Linkage of DNA Damage/Repair Deficiency in Neurodegenerative Diseases","088645","NOMD","Neural Oxidative Metabolism and Death Study Section ","","","03","232969","111625","344594",""

We have shown that these proteins, not normally present in the adult but abundant  in the early embryo, exert in tumors the precise effect they due during early fetal formation, namely the  stimulation of growth of ?stem-like? cells important for early colonization and long-term growth potential. We  have identified targets for the Id proteins that likely mediate its effects and will test the importance of these  proteins in cells grown in the laboratory and in animal models of breast cancer. We have also identified a key  growth factor that stimulates Id protein expression in breast cancer and will further characterize its precise  mechanism of action. Finally, we have identified a small, drug-like molecule that severely attenuates the ability  of the Id proteins to work and shows evidence of inhibiting primary breast cancer growth in living animals.  These molecules will be further analyzed for their anti-metastatic activity in mouse models and a more  complete description of its biological activity is sought. This compound is among the first to antagonize the  ability of a protein to interact with its partner and may facilitate the identification of similar molecules that will  likely have broad clinical application.","1879384; ","BENEZRA, ROBERT I;","","","","Adult; Affect; Animal Model; Animals; Area; Attenuated; Biochemical; Biological; Biological Assay; Blood; Blood Circulation; Breast Cancer Cell; Breast cancer metastasis; Breast Cancer Model; Breast Cancer Patient; Cancer Biology; Cancer Cell Growth; Cancer Relapse; Cells; Cessation of life; Clinical; clinical application; clinically significant; Collaborations; Data; Embryo; Epithelial; epithelial to mesenchymal transition; fetal; Gene Expression; Genetic Transcription; Goals; Growth; Growth Factor; helix-loop-helix protein differentiation inhibitor; Human; In Vitro; in vivo; knock-down; Laboratories; Lung; lung metastatic; Maintenance; malignant breast neoplasm; Malignant Neoplasms; Mammospheres; MDA MB 231; Mediating; Mesenchymal; Metaplastic; Metastatic Neoplasm to the Lung; metastatic process; Morbidity - disease rate; mouse model; Neoplasm Metastasis; novel; Outcome; overexpression; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phenotype; Population; Pre-Clinical Model; Primary Neoplasm; Process; programs; promoter; Property; protein expression; Proteins; Regulation; response; Role; Sampling; Seeds; self-renewal; Set protein; Site; small hairpin RNA; small molecule; stem; Stream; Structure of parenchyma of lung; Testing; transcription factor; Travel; tumor; tumor growth; Tumor Initiators; TWIST1 gene; Undifferentiated; Work; ","Role and Regulation of Id1 during Breast Cancer Metastasis Initiation","094060","ZCA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","5139","","14","278246","211188","","489434"

Recent identification of rare mutations in the STAT5B gene in children exhibiting severe growth failure who were profoundly IGF-1 deficient, GH insensitive, and immune deficient, provides an unique opportunity to expand on these in vivo observations and study how STAT5b mediates GH signals for IGF-1 production.

This dual-site project will: (1) test a novel media rich online CBT as a 1st stage adjunctive treatment to positive airway pressure (PAP) for patients with comorbid OSA and insomnia; and (2) compare outcomes of extended engagement with the online CBT against a therapist-delivered CBT used as a 2nd stage intervention with those patients who do not show optimal short term outcomes with the online therapy.","1864408 (contact); 1960418; ","EDINGER, JACK D (contact); MANBER, RACHEL ;","BROWN, MARISHKA ","09/01/2016","06/30/2021","actigraphy; Address; Adherence; Adverse effects; Affect; Aftercare; Apnea; Behavioral; care recipients; Chronic Insomnia; clinical practice; Cognitive; Comorbid Insomnia; Comorbidity; Control Groups; Data; design; diaries; Disease remission; Drowsiness; Education; effective therapy; Enrollment; Failure; Fatigue; follow-up; functional outcomes; Hygiene; Improve Access; improved; indexing; interactive therapy; Intervention; Knowledge; Measures; Methods; Modeling; Morbidity - disease rate; novel; Obstructive Sleep Apnea; Outcome; Outcome Measure; Outcome Study; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; pressure; primary outcome; Process; programs; Provider; Quebec; Questionnaires; Randomized; Randomized Clinical Trials; Reporting; Research; Residual state; respiratory; response; Role; Sampling; Secondary Insomnia; Sedation procedure; Severities; Site; Sleep; Sleep Apnea Syndromes; Sleeplessness; Symptoms; Syndrome; Testing; Time; Training; treatment as usual; treatment effect; vigilance; ","Stepped-care management of insomnia co-occurring with sleep apnea","130559","CLTR","Clinical Trials Review Committee ","","","02","604256","150552","754808",""

Together, these samples along with >1000 currently existing iPSC lines banked by participating CTSA sites will be catalogued and made available to all CTSAs along with a genome-editing ?toolbox?, consisting of already-edited iPSC lines as well protocols and reagents to allow investigators to themselves edit the genomes of lines of their choosing. Finally, CTSAs participating in this proposal will establish and conduct an annual educational, hands-on iPSC culture course to provide essential training in iPSC culture and related techniques and thus maximize the potential utility of the CTSA iPSC bank and toolbox.","9085086; 8343956; 6406539 (contact); 1865475; 8081144; ","COWAN, CHAD ALBERT; GILAD, YOAV ; KOTTON, DARRELL N.

Our proposed strategy uses Unisun technology to engineer a transtympanic injection of ganciclovir-loaded microspheres that are designed to remain affixed to the round-window membrane of the inner ear and provide localized, controlled, and sustained release of the therapeutic throughout the treatment period.","10265112; ","DORMER, NATHAN H;","MILLER, ROGER ","07/07/2017","06/30/2018","4 year old; Accounting; Active Sites; Address; Adhesions; Affect; Age-Months; Agreement; Anatomic Surface; Animal Model; Antiviral Agents; Antiviral Therapy; Biocompatible; biomaterial compatibility; Birth; Capital; carcinogenicity; Cavia; Child; Clinical Trials; clinically relevant; congenital cytomegalovirus; controlled release; Cytomegalovirus Infections; Data; design; Development; Diffusion; Disease; dosage; Dose; Drug Controls; Drug Delivery Systems; Engineering; Ensure; exhibitions; Exhibits; FDA approved; Film; Formulation; Funding; Ganciclovir; Goals; Grant; hearing impairment; Human; Immobilization; improved; In Vitro; in vitro testing; in vivo; Infant; Infection; Injection of therapeutic agent; innovation; Intravenous; Investments; Kinetics; Label; Labyrinth; Length; Liquid substance; Membrane; Microencapsulations; Microspheres; middle ear; Modeling; Morphology; Mus; Needles; Neutropenia; Newborn Infant; non-genetic; novel; novel strategies; Oral; Outcome; Particle Size; Patients; Perilymph; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacologic Substance; Phase; Positioning Attribute; preclinical trial; Process; Prodrugs; Property; Regimen; Reporting; Research; round window; Safety; Sensorineural Hearing Loss; Shapes; Site; Small Business Innovation Research Grant; spatiotemporal; standard of care; Steroids; success; System; Techniques; Technology; Teratogens; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Effect; Therapeutic Index; Time; Toxic effect; Toxicology; treatment duration; treatment strategy; United States National Institutes of Health; Valganciclovir; Virus Diseases; Work; ","Precision Microspheres for Transtympanic Delivery of Ganciclovir for CMV Infection","015926","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","01","","","224963",""

A recent trend regards hospital-acquired infections and pressure ulcers as the result of conditions in (and thus the burden of) healthcare facilities, causing the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to cease paying hospitals for these 'preventable complications', resulting in a significant shift in the burden of the cost of healthcare ultimately back to the patient, with substantial economic and social ramifications. The studies proposed here have the potential to uncover the mechanisms at the root of the failure of the normal healing process that results in the development of chronic wounds and may provide novel therapeutic paths by manipulation of metabolic pathways that control the relevant immune cell phenotypes. The proposed metabolomic studies on host-pathogen interactions will identify specific metabolite profiles that may be associated with pathogenicity in the chronic wound and could potentially be used in novel diagnostics; therefore, these studies have direct translational potential that may augment the clinical toolbox needed to face the healthcare burden of chronic wounds.","9888923; ","AMMONS, MARY CLOUD BOSWORTH;","OKITA, RICHARD T.","09/17/2012","08/31/2017","","Metabolomic Analysis as a Tool to Understanding the Use of Novel Therapeutics in a Host-Pathogen Model of the Chronic Wound Environment","103821","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","06","33035","2643","35678",""

An inability to manage one's emotions (emotion dysregulation) is an underlying mechanism of IA. Reducing IA and increasing use of PTSD evidence-based psychotherapies are two critical missions for the Veterans Health Administration. The proposed research supports these missions by providing a 3-session emotion regulation training (Manage Emotions to Reduce Aggression) to Veterans in order to teach them how to manage emotions and prepare for PTSD treatment. By enhancing Veterans' abilities to cope with trauma-related emotions and feel equipped to initiate PTSD treatments, this research aims to help Veterans decrease IA and ultimately recover from PTSD.","12316320 (contact); 7628323; ","MILES, SHANNON R.

The incidence of IPF increases with age and is more common in males compared to females. Little is known about the development of IPF in humans, but cigarette smoking and environmental dust exposure, both common among US veterans, constitute two established risk factors for disease development. In addition, recently deployed military persons exposed to burn pits and pollutants may also have an increased risk of IPF as they age. Thus, patients in the VA health care system are expected to have a higher rate of IPF than the general population, establishing a major potential health issue facing US veterans. The Department of Veterans Affairs has recently acknowledged this serious risk to US veterans and is currently enrolling patients for the Rehabilitation of IPF Patients clinical trial. Our proposed studies represent a novel opportunity to identify new therapeutic targets for the treatment of IPF and other fibrotic lung diseases.","9418782; ","REDENTE, ELIZABETH FRANCES;","","04/01/2015","03/31/2020","Address; Age; Air; Anti-inflammatory; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Apoptosis; Apoptotic; Architecture; Biological Models; Bleomycin; bone; Bone Marrow; Caspase; Cells; Characteristics; Chimera organism; Cicatrix; cigarette smoking; Clinical Trials; Collagen; cytokine; Development; Disease; Dust; effective therapy; Enrollment; environmental tobacco smoke exposure; experimental study; Female; Fibroblasts; Fibrosis; General Population; Genetic; genetic manipulation; Goals; Growth Factor; Hamman-Rich syndrome; Health; Healthcare Systems; Human; human disease; humanized mouse; Image; Impairment; In Vitro; in vivo; in vivo Model; Incidence; Inflammatory; Injectable; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I; Interstitial Lung Diseases; K-Series Research Career Programs; Liquid substance; Lung; Lung diseases; macrophage; male; Marrow; Matrix Metalloproteinases; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; Military Personnel; Modeling; Molecular; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; mouse model; Mus; Myofibroblast; new therapeutic target; novel; novel therapeutic intervention; novel therapeutics; Outcome; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Patients; Persons; Phenotype; Platelet-Derived Growth Factor; Play; pollutant; Population; Populations at Risk; Process; Production; public health relevance; Pulmonary Fibrosis; Rehabilitation therapy; Reporter; Repression; Resolution; response; restoration; Risk; Risk Factors; Role; Smooth Muscle Actin Staining Method; targeted treatment; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Intervention; therapy development; Time; Tissues; TNF gene; TNFRSF1A gene; Translating; Translations; United States; Veterans; Work; ","Mechanisms of TNF-alpha Mediated Resolution of Pulmonary Fibrosis","002401","PULM","Respiration ","","","03","","","",""

With the tremendous medical advances over the past 50 years, the U.S. population's life expectancy has dramatically increased, but because the incidence of most cancers increases with age, cancers have become a profound challenge to the U.S. health care system. Minorities suffer a disproportionate burden of the cancer threat with disparate outcomes for many cancer types. To meet these challenges, dedicated cancer research at the SKCCC and elsewhere over the past 35 years has generated fundamental insights into the molecular mechanisms that cause human cancers to arise, progress and threaten life.

In recent war-related conflicts traumatic brain injury, especially mild forms or concussions, have become signature injuries producing progressive long-term damage to the brain. We discovered that treatment with naturally occurring protein factors can dramatically reduce damage resulting from mild brain injury, and help in the recovery from mild brain injury in mice. Because at least one of these factors has been used in humans it could potentially be applied quickly in people with brain damage. We propose to refine our model of mild traumatic brain injury and assess long-term pathological and cognitive changes. Most importantly, we will treat such impaired mice with neuroregenerative protein therapies days, weeks or months after the initial traumatic impact occurred. If successful, our findings could be rapidly transferred to clinical studies in humans; hopefully benefiting veterans in the near future in the recovery and rehabilitation from brain injury.","2204829; ","WYSS-CORAY, TONY ;","","01/01/2014","12/31/2018","Acute Brain Injuries; Affect; Aftercare; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Anxiety; Applications Grants; Attenuated; Behavior; behavior test; Behavioral; behavioral impairment; Biological; Bolus Infusion; Brain; Brain Concussion; Brain Injuries; C57BL/6 Mouse; Chronic; chronic traumatic encephalopathy; Clinic; Clinical; Clinical Research; Closed head injuries; Cognition; Cognitive; cognitive change; Cognitive deficits; Colony-Stimulating Factor Receptors; Colony-Stimulating Factors; Conflict (Psychology); CSF1 gene; Data; Dementia; early onset; Environmental Risk Factor; experience; FDA approved; Fright; Frontotemporal Dementia; Future; Genetic Models; Gliosis; Growth Factor; Head; Hematopoietic System; Human; Impairment; Impulsivity; Inflammation; injured; Injury; interest; Lead; Learning; Ligands; Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor; Measurement; Measures; Mediating; Memory; Memory impairment; Mental Depression; mild traumatic brain injury; Military Personnel; Modeling; Molecular; Monitor; Motor; mouse model; Mus; Nerve Degeneration; Nerve Regeneration; Neuraxis; neurobehavioral; Neurodegenerative Disorders; neuroinflammation; Neurons; neuropsychological; Neuropsychology; Neurotoxins; Parkinson Disease; Parkinsonian Disorders; Pathologic; Pathology; Patients; Population; pre-clinical; Proteins; public health relevance; receptor; Receptor Signaling; Recovery; Recurrence; reduce symptoms; regenerative; Rehabilitation therapy; Social Interaction; stroke; Symptoms; Testing; Time; Translations; Traumatic Brain Injury; Variant; Veterans; War; white matter change; ","Aging and Inflammation in Mild Traumatic Brain Injury","001218","RRDB","Brain Injury ","","","04","","","",""

The ability to translate those discoveries as well as to make new discoveries within human investigations has been a challenge and has been often characterized as the bottleneck of clinical research. We hypothesize that the fundamental bottlenecks associated with clinical translational research can be dramatically loosened with the training of engineers intimately familiar with human treatment and trained in the inception of novel technology-based platforms. The purpose of this training program is to create a new cadre of researchers capable of creating, developing, implementing, clinically evaluating, and translating methods, devices, algorithms, and systems designed with a clear focus at one particular application of medicine, namely, to facilitate surgical/interventiona processes and their outcomes.

To investigate, we will examine the respiratory effects of obesity in prepubescent boys and girls, including those with respiratory symptoms misdiagnosed as asthma, before and after 1) a program of weight loss and regular exercise and 2) continued weight gain as compared with prepubescent normal weight boys and girls before and after 1 year.

While our recent findings have strengthened the evidence for the primary role of T-cells autoreactive to (pro)insulin in advanced human islet autoimmunity, we still lack robust T-cell biomarkers that could clearly reflect activity of autoreactive T cells, especially at the earliest stages of islet autoimmunity or during immunomodulation to prevent progression to diabetes.

Because there is currently no evidence-based treatment for GWI, the RAC recommended in 2014 that the 'first priority of federal Gulf War illness research must be the identification of effective treatments to  improve the health of GW Veterans.' Not only is insomnia common among Veterans with GWI (all Veterans with GWI in our current VA Merit project likely have clinical insomnia), but untreated insomnia can lead to significant medical and psychiatric morbidity. The proposed study will examine the efficacy of telephone-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) for controlling sleep and non-sleep symptoms in Veterans with GWI.

According to the www.va.gov website, 11-20% of individuals that served in OIF or OEF develop PTSD, a rate that is substantially higher than the general population (7-8%). Women appear to be more a risk for PTSD than men, often occurring in the context of sexual assault (which can occur during military service). Frontline treatment options (e.g., SSRIs) can improve symptoms but do not currently offer a cure. To develop further strategies to this end, it is critical to understand the foundations of the disease process as it develops. This proposal examines the role of prefrontal cortex pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide (PACAP) in mitigating the effects of traumatic stress exposure in a preclinical model. Studies are designed to establish whether PACAP treatment may be useful in attenuating or preventing aberrant physiological and behavioral stress responses characteristic of PTSD in males and females. The results of these studies will be important in consideration of PACAP as a potential therapeutic.","1862776; ","HERMAN, JAMES P;","","07/01/2017","06/30/2021","acute stress; Affect; Anatomy; Animals; Anxiety; anxiety-like behavior; anxiety-related behavior; Attenuated; Behavior; Behavioral; biological adaptation to stress; Cells; Characteristics; Chronic; Chronic stress; conditioned fear; Corticosterone; Data; design; Development; Disease; disorder risk; Down-Regulation; Electrophysiology (science); emotion regulation; Emotional; Emotional disorder; Endocrine; Event; experimental study; Exposure to; Extinction (Psychology); fear memory; Female; Foundations; Fright; Functional disorder; Gene Expression; General Population; Genes; genetic approach; Genetic Polymorphism; Genetic study; Health; Homologous Gene; Human; imaging approach; imaging study; Impairment; Incidence; indexing; Individual; Infusion procedures; Link; male; Mediating; Membrane; Memory; Memory Disorders; men; Messenger RNA; Military Personnel; Modification; Neuronal Plasticity; Neuropeptides; Neurosecretory Systems; Pathology; Patients; Pharmacology; Phenotype; Physiological; pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide; pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide receptor; Pituitary Gland; Play; polypeptide; post-traumatic stress; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders; pre-clinical; Pre-Clinical Model; Predisposition; Prefrontal Cortex; prevent; Prevention; Process; Rattus; receptor; Regimen; Regulatory Pathway; response; Risk; risk variant; RNA Interference; Role; Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor; Services; sex; Sex Characteristics; sexual assault; Signal Transduction; social anxiety; Stress; Supplementation; symptomatic improvement; System; Testing; Therapeutic; therapeutic target; Time; Trauma; treatment strategy; Veterans; web site; Woman; Women's Health; ","Neuropeptide Mechanisms and Stress Pathologies","003858","MHBA","Mental Health and Behavioral Science A ","","","01","","","",""

To understand why TTR aggregates, we will test the hypothesis that the biology of the cellular protein homeostasis network strongly influences the folded structure, the kinetic stability, and amyloidogenicity of secreted TTR?thus TTR has a memory of how it was folded and this influences its aggregation propensity.","1893922; ","KELLY, JEFFERY W;","ROY, CINDY ","05/01/1993","06/30/2021","Address; Adopted; Aftercare; Age; aged; Amyloidosis; Anabolism; Atomic Force Microscopy; Automobile Driving; Biochemical; Biological; Biological Assay; biomarker identification; Blood; Buffers; Caenorhabditis elegans; Cardiac Myocytes; Cardiomyopathies; Cardiotoxicity; Cell Death; Cells; Cellular biology; Cessation of life; Client; conformer; Controlled Clinical Trials; Cryoelectron Microscopy; cytotoxicity; Degenerative Disorder; Development; Diagnosis; Diagnostic; Diflunisal; Disease; Disease Progression; disorder risk; Dissociation; Dose; Elderly; Electron Microscopy; Endocytosis; exhibitions; Exhibits; experimental study; Extracellular Space; Familial Amyloidosis; Fractionation; Functional disorder; Genetic Transcription; Goals; Heart; Hepatocyte; Human; In Vitro; in vivo; Injectable; insight; Lead; Link; Liver; male; Memory; Methods; Mitotic; Molecular Chaperones; Molecular Conformation; Monitor; Monoclonal Antibodies; monomer; Morphology; Muscle; mutant; Mutation; Negative Staining; Neurons; Neuropathy; neurotoxic; non-Native; novel; novel therapeutics; older men; Organism; Paper; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Patients; Penetrance; Peptides; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacotherapy; Placebo Control; Plasma; Polyneuropathy; Population; Prealbumin; Primary Myocardial Diseases; Process; protein aggregation; protein folding; Proteins; proteostasis; proteotoxicity; Pump; reconstitution; Research; Resistance; response; Sampling; Science; solid state nuclear magnetic resonance; Spinal Ganglia; Structure; Testing; Thermodynamics; Time; tissue tropism; Tissues; trafficking; Variant; ","Probing the Biochemical Mechanisms of Amyloid Disease","046335","MSFB","Macromolecular Structure and Function B Study Section ","","","26","516373","273491","789864",""

Core B We are taking a new path for Core B in order to streamline our services and foster core-project interactions. The first change is Dr. Gentleman will join Core B rather than having a standalone project. This decision was made for the benefit of the Program goals, as we seek to determine whether the changes that we identify and characterize in experimental model settings are present in corresponding diseases and conditions that our model systems endeavor to mimic. Dr. Gentleman?s role in Core B greatly expands our access to very large collections of well characterized human tissue such as approximately 500 AD and 600 PD, 60 AD/PD, 30 Lewy body dementia (LBD), 33 Down?s (DS), 800 chronic epilepsy, 500 Huntington?s (HD), 14 chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), and 2000 neurologically and neuropathologically normal cases. The second change is related in that, between the collections available to Dr. Gentleman and those in our UAMS Brain Bank housed in and managed by Core B, we have sufficient material for the needs of our investigators and for those of non- program investigators on request. Core B at UAMS holds tissue from 698 autopsies that include fixed tissue blocks and sections from 23 separate brain regions from AD, PD, AD/PD, LBD, HD, and neurologically and neuropathologically normal cases. Over and above these, we have tissue blocks from 68 DS, and 92 blocks of tissues collected at surgery for drug resistant, intractable epilepsy. All have representative sections stained with Nissl/H&E and with Campbell-Switzer and Bielschowsky-Sevier-Munger, are stored and cataloged along with photomicrographic data that is accessible on our secure server. Moreover, Dr. Mrak, who evaluated all of the tissue in our UAMS bank, will continue as our collaborator. Importantly, Core B houses discreet 3-D- dissected, flash frozen structures, e.g., olfactory bulb, hippocampus, etc., for molecular analysis in Core C. The availability of these large collections along with data available on our database, together with the collections available to Dr. Gentleman, will allow our Program investigators to focus on brain regions spanning the gamut of affected locales and to facilitate identification and characterization of pathways that give rise to either successful aging or decline into disease. Core B deliverables include: i) discreet 3-D dissected nuclei and regions from the left side of brain for use by Core C personnel; and ii) Nissl/H&E/silver stains, light and fluorescence immunohistochemistry, digital imaging, image capture, and preliminary analyses of fixed tissue sections according to investigator request; and iii) precise detection of protein-protein proximity in tissues and cells is now offered by the core via Duolink proximity ligation assays (PLA). These core services favor successful completion of aims of each Project. Standardized protocols, record keeping, and primary data analysis?hallmarks of the work of Drs. Griffin and Gentleman?are vital for successful completion of the specific aims of the projects in this Program.","7747899; ","GRIFFIN, SUE TILTON;","","","","3-Dimensional; Achievement; Affect; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease; Amygdaloid structure; Animals; Antibodies; Autopsy; Biochemical; Biological Assay; Biological Models; Brain; Brain region; brain tissue; Caenorhabditis elegans; Catalogs; caudate nucleus; Cell Nucleus; Cells; Chronic; chronic traumatic encephalopathy; Clinical; Collaborations; Collection; college; Data; Data Analyses; Databases; Detection; digital imaging; Disease; Dissection; Drug resistance; Epilepsy; Event; Experimental Models; experimental study; Fluorescence; Formalin; Fostering; Freezing; Funding; Goals; Hippocampus (Brain); Histologic; Human; human disease; Human Resources; human tissue; Huntington Disease; Hypothalamic structure; Image; Immunohistochemistry; immunoreaction; Institution; Intractable Epilepsy; Investigation; Left; Lewy Body Dementia; Ligation; Light; Locales; London; member; Modeling; Molecular; Molecular Analysis; Morphology; mouse model; Mus; Neurologic; neuropathology; olfactory bulb; Operative Surgical Procedures; Parkinson Disease; Pathogenesis; Pathologic; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Patients; Preparation; Procedures; Process; programs; Proteins; Protocols documentation; Research Personnel; Resources; Role; Secure; Services; Side; Silver Staining; Site; Specimen; Staining method; Stains; Standardization; Structure; Substantia nigra structure; Techniques; tissue processing; Tissue Sample; tissue/cell culture; Tissues; Transgenic Organisms; United Kingdom; Work; ","Core B: Neuropathology","012411","ZAG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","7942","","18","224333","85563","","309896"

However it is not clear whether and how estrogens impact the airway. We propose that in the inflamed or asthmatic airway, estrogens might actually be beneficial in terms of their effects on airway smooth muscle: the important cell type involved in airway contractility and also in structural changes (remodeling) that occurs in asthma. Our studies using human airway smooth muscles from both male and female asthmatics vs. non-asthmatics, along with animal studies where we control estrogen levels or their signaling, will substantially enhance our understanding of how and why estrogens influence the asthmatic airway. This is a necessary and clinically important step if we are to develop novel therapeutic strategies for asthma in males or females using modulators of sex steroids and their effects.","10828113; ","VENKATACHALEM, SATHISH ;","NOEL, PATRICIA ","08/01/2015","06/30/2020","Affect; Aging; Agonist; airway inflammation; airway remodeling; Allergens; Animals; Asthma; asthmatic; asthmatic airway; base; Bronchodilation; cell type; Cells; Chronic; Clinical; clinically significant; Collagen; Conflict (Psychology); Controlled Study; Coupled; CREB1 gene; Cyclic AMP; Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases; cytokine; Cytokine Signaling; Data; Disease; epidemiologic data; Epithelium; Estradiol; Estrogen Receptor alpha; Estrogen Receptor beta; Estrogen Receptors; Estrogens; extracellular; Extracellular Matrix; Extracellular Matrix Proteins; Extrinsic asthma; Female; Fibronectins; genetic regulatory protein; Genetic Transcription; Genomics; Goals; Gonadal Steroid Hormones; GPER gene; Human; Immune; Immune response; Immune system; In Vitro; in vivo; Incidence; Inflammation; interest; Interleukin-13; Knockout Mice; Lasers; Lead; Lung; male; MAP Kinase Gene; MAPK14 gene; Matrix Metalloproteinases; men; Messenger RNA; methacholine; Mitogens; MMP2 gene; MMP9 gene; Modeling; Molecular Profiling; mouse allergen; mouse model; Muscle; muscular structure; NF-kappa B; novel therapeutics; Ovariectomy; Pathway interactions; Physiological; Platelet-Derived Growth Factor; Play; Premenopause; Production; Protein Analysis; Protein Isoforms; public health relevance; receptor; receptor expression; receptor function; Receptor Signaling; respiratory smooth muscle; reuptake; Role; Severities; sex; Signal Transduction; Small Interfering RNA; STAT6 gene; Symptoms; TNF gene; Transcription Factor AP-1; Woman; Women's Role; ","Estrogen Receptor Signaling in Airway Inflammation","123494","LCMI","Lung Cellular, Molecular, and Immunobiology Study Section ","","","03","250000","90947","340947",""

Veterans with mTBI produced by repetitive concussions have a much higher risk of sustained TBI with the chronic neurodegenerative disorders. Evidence suggests that the glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) inhibitors may possess a therapeutic potential in treating sustained TBI as the drugs can block conversion of acute TBI to sustained TBI. This project will investigate therapeutic effects of GSK-3 inhibitors on the neuropathology, cognitive deficits and synaptic plasticity, the essential neuronal basis of cognitive deficits, of sustained TBI produced by repetitive concussions using a murine mTBI model.

With the tremendous medical advances over the past 50 years, the U.S. population's life expectancy has dramatically increased, but because the incidence of most cancers increases with age, cancers have become a profound challenge to the U.S. health care system. Minorities suffer a disproportionate burden of the cancer threat with disparate outcomes for many cancer types. To meet these challenges, dedicated cancer research at the SKCCC and elsewhere over the past 35 years has generated fundamental insights into the molecular mechanisms that cause human cancers to arise, progress and threaten life.

Our study proposes to examine the immune responses associated with progression and during recovery in order to better understand pathogenic mechanisms that lead to disease progression and protective mechanisms that promote resolution. Using experimental models of acute pancreatitis, we characterize the immune responses and determine pathways that can be targeted to improve disease outcome. Our preliminary results identify some of the important immune mechanisms involved and highlight the possibility of interfering with these immune pathways to confer protection against the disease and promote recovery.","7931431; ","HABTEZION, AIDA ;","SERRANO, JOSE ","09/20/2011","03/30/2021","Acute; Acute Disease; acute pancreatitis; Admission activity; Adoptive Transfer; Alcohols; Animals; Biliary; Biliverdine; Blood; burden of illness; Calculi; Carbon Monoxide; Cell Communication; cell injury; Cell Therapy; Cells; Characteristics; chronic pancreatitis; Clinical; clinical practice; Clinical Trials; clinically significant; Coupled; cytokine; Cytometry; Data; Development; Disease; Disease Outcome; Disease Progression; Distant; DNA; Enrollment; Europe; Excision; Experimental Models; Frequencies; gastrointestinal; Genes; heme oxygenase-1; Hemin; Hemoglobin; Heterogeneity; Hospitals; Human; Immune; immune activation; Immune response; improved; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Inflammatory Response; Interferons; Interleukin-10; interleukin-22; Lead; Leukocytes; Lung; macrophage; Macrophage Activation; Mediating; Modeling; monocyte; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Nature; novel; novel therapeutics; Organ; Pancreas; Pancreatitis; Pathogenesis; Pathogenicity; Pathway interactions; Patients; Phase; Phenotype; Pilot Projects; Precipitating Factors; Prevention; Progressive Disease; Prosthesis; protective effect; Receptor Up-Regulation; Recovery; Recruitment Activity; Research; Resolution; Role; Signal Transduction; Spleen; stellate cell; Stream; System; T-Cell Activation; T-Lymphocyte; Techniques; Testing; Therapeutic; Time; TLR4 gene; TNF gene; Translating; Virus Diseases; ","Role of hemeoxygenase-1 in experimental acute pancreatitis","092421","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","06","273544","168356","441900",""

The interaction between increased fall risk, reduced balance confidence and high prevalence of a fear of falling often leads to restricted mobility and loss of independence. Critically, the cause of these falls and the role that inherent balance plays in fall risk is poorly understood. This study proposes to identify key differences in balance and mobility between older below-knee prosthesis users who have fallen twice or more in the past 12 months and those who have fallen once or less, and compare both groups to data from able- bodied individuals. By further understanding the differences between these groups and relationships between fall risk and various outcome measures, intervention techniques can be developed to improve functional balance. An improvement in upright balance will reduce the occurrence of falls and fall related injuries in this veteran population, as well as increase their participation in daily activities and improve their quality of life.","10469806; ","MAJOR, MATTHEW J.;","","07/01/2014","06/30/2018","Address; Affect; Age; Aging; Amputation; Amputees; Articular Range of Motion; Assessment tool; Award; Balance training; base; Behavior; Biomechanics; care systems; career; career development; Characteristics; Clinical; clinical care; clinical development; clinical diagnostics; Clinical Sciences; clinically relevant; control theory; Controlled Study; Data; design; Detection; Development; Development Plans; Doctor of Philosophy; Education; Elderly; Equilibrium; exhibitions; Exhibits; experience; experimental study; Exposure to; fall risk; falls; fear of falling; Foundational Skills; Future; Gait; Gender; Goals; Grant; Guidelines; Health; Health Hazards; Healthcare Systems; High Prevalence; Human; Impairment; improved; Incidence; Independent Living; Individual; Injury; insight; Intervention; Investigation; Joints; K-Series Research Career Programs; Knee Prosthesis; Knowledge; Laboratory Research; Lead; Leadership; limb amputation; Limb structure; Link; Locomotion; Logistic Regressions; Lower Extremity; Matched Group; Medical center; Mentors; Mission; Modeling; mortality; Motion; Motor; motor control; Movement; Muscle; muscle strength; Musculoskeletal; Musculoskeletal Equilibrium; Nervous System control; Neuraxis; neuromuscular; novel; Outcome; Outcome Measure; Patient Care; Persons; Play; Population; Predictive Factor; predictive modeling; programs; Proprioception; prospective; Prosthesis; Prosthesis Design; prosthesis wearer; public health relevance; Quality of life; Reading; Recovery; Regression Analysis; Rehabilitation Research; rehabilitation science; Rehabilitation therapy; Reporting; Research; Research Activity; research and development; Research Personnel; Research Project Grants; Research Training; Risk; Role; Scientist; Sensory; Series; Services; skills; Solid; somatosensory; synergism; System; technique development; Techniques; Therapeutic Intervention; therapy development; tool; Training; Training Activity; Translational Research; treadmill; Veterans; Vision; Walking; Writing; ","Sensory-Motor Mechanisms Underlying Fall Risk in Transtibial Amputees","001322","RRD8","Career Development Program - Panel I ","","","04","","","",""

Although the causal factor for AD remains to be established, large amount of studies suggest that formation of extracellular amyloid plaques occur before the intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. Abnormal accumulation of amyloid peptides (A), the major component in the plaques, leads to the formation of A and subsequent formation of amyloid plaques. Hence, inhibition of A generation is an important AD therapeutic strategy. BACE1 is a critical enzyme for the generation of A; compounds that can inhibit BACE1 activity are being developed for AD therapy. For the safe use of BACE1 inhibitors in human, we aim to investigate whether conditional deletion of BACE1 in adult mice will prevent formation of amyloid plaques and remove the pre-formed plaques. In addition, Individuals with DS develop age-related cognitive decline and AD dementia by 30-40 years earlier than in the general population. AD and DS share certain molecular changes in related to the formation of amyloid deposition. Hence, our model will be applied to the study in the Down syndrome mouse model and we will also explore the beneficial effect of BACE1 inhibition in Down syndrome (DS) patients. Our study will also reveal whether significant inhibition of BACE1 will cause abnormal effects. The knowledge gained from this study will have timely and important guidance for the use of BACE1 inhibitors in human.","7939685; ","YAN, RIQIANG ;","PETANCESKA, SUZANA ","09/30/2013","06/30/2018","Address; Adult; Adverse effects; Age; Age-associated memory impairment; Alzheimer's Disease; Amyloid; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Amyloid deposition; amyloid formation; amyloid peptide; axonal guidance; Behavior; Behavioral; beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1; Biological Process; Body Size; Body Weight; Brain; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21; Cleaved cell; Clinical Trials; Cognitive deficits; cognitive function; Death Rate; Defect; Dementia; Development; Down Syndrome; Doxycycline; drug discovery; Elderly; Elements; Enteral; Enterobacteria phage P1 Cre recombinase; Enzymes; Epilepsy; experimental study; extracellular; Functional disorder; functional outcomes; gamma secretase; General Population; Generations; Genes; Growth; Human; human study; Impairment; improved; Incidence; Individual; inhibitor/antagonist; Knockout Mice; Knowledge; Learning; Mediating; Membrane; Memory; Memory impairment; Modeling; Molecular; mouse model; mouse Ts65Dn; Mus; myelination; Neonatal; Neuregulin 1; Neurofibrillary Tangles; Neurologic Dysfunctions; Oral; overexpression; Pathologic; Pathology; Patients; Peptide Vaccines; Peptides; phase II trial; Phenotype; Plasma; postnatal; prevent; Production; Protein Fragment; public health relevance; recombinase-mediated cassette exchange; Reporting; Retinal; Role; Schedule; Schizophrenia; Seizures; Senile Plaques; small molecule; Sodium Channel; Survival Rate; synaptic function; Synaptic Transmission; System; tau Proteins; Testing; Tetanus Helper Peptide; Tetracycline Control; Therapeutic; therapeutic target; Time; Tissues; Transgenic Mice; voltage; Wild Type Mouse; ","Inhibition of BACE1 for benefiting Alzheimer's patients","046929","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","05","205000","119925","324925",""

Upon completion of the proposed 6 month toxicology studies in rats and dogs, the company plans to conduct rigorous testing of the safety and efficacy of chronic administration of IRX4204 in controlled clinical trials in both relapsing-remitting, and progressive MS patient populations, treated with the drug for six months or longer, i.e., studies of sufficient duration to demonstrate clinical efficacy in these MS patient populations.","11774158; ","CHANDRARATNA, ROSH ;","MINNICOZZI, MICHAEL ","06/11/2014","06/30/2018","Acute; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Advanced Development; Adverse effects; Affect; Agonist; American; Animal Model; Autopsy; Bexarotene; Blinded; Budgets; Cancer Patient; cancer type; Canis familiaris; capsule; Cardiovascular system; Cells; Chronic; Chronic Disease; Clinical; Clinical Chemistry; Clinical Data; clinical efficacy; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials; Clinical Trials Design; CNS autoimmune disease; Controlled Clinical Trials; Data; Development; Disease; Disease Progression; Disease remission; Doctor of Philosophy; Dose; Drug Evaluation; Drug Kinetics; drug testing; effective therapy; efficacy testing; efficacy trial; Evaluation; experience; Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis; Flare; FOXP3 gene; Funding; Future; Gel; Genes; Goals; Guidelines; Health; Hematology; Human; Immune; Immune system; immunoregulation; in vivo; Industry; Inflammatory; Interleukin-17; Japanese Population; Laboratories; Licensure; Longitudinal Studies; Malignant Neoplasms; Medical; Microscopic; Modeling; mouse model; Multiple Sclerosis; multiple sclerosis patient; Mus; Myelin; Myelin Sheath; nanomolar; Neurodegenerative Disorders; Neurology; Neurons; neuroprotection; Notification; novel; Nuclear Receptors; oligodendrocyte precursor; Oligodendroglia; Oral; Organ; Paralysed; Parkinson Disease; patient population; Patients; Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacologic Substance; Pharmacology; Pharmacology Study; Phase; Phase II Clinical Trials; pre-clinical; preclinical development; preclinical efficacy; preclinical safety; Preclinical Testing; precursor cell; Process; Production; Progress Reports; protective effect; Protein Isoforms; Randomized; Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials; Rattus; receptor; Receptor Activation; Regulatory Affairs; Regulatory T-Lymphocyte; Relapse; repaired; Research; research clinical testing; respiratory; Risk; Rodent; RXR; Safety; safety study; safety testing; Severity of illness; sex; SJL Mouse; Small Business Innovation Research Grant; small molecule; Social Welfare; Specific qualifier value; Supervision; Testing; Therapeutic; therapeutic candidate; Time; Tissues; Toxic effect; Toxicology; treatment duration; United States National Institutes of Health; Urinalysis; ","Development of the RXR agonist IRX4204 to treat Multiple Sclerosis and other Immune related Diseases","112512","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","03","","","1000000",""

This proposal will use iron-oxide nanoparticles (NPs) to target platelets and hMSCs to a site of musculoskeletal injury in vivo by exploiting the magnetic properties of NPs. We propose that the location of platelets and regenerative cells can be controlled by use of a surface magnet; thus allowing movement of platelets/cells to a desire site, clustering to enrich the area with growth factors, and preventing the premature loss at the site of injury.

Minimizing blood volume for pediatric coagulation screening (HL125484) Abnormalities of blood coagulation increase the risk of clot formation inside a blood vessel (thrombosis) and bleeding. Thrombosis is a common but under-diagnosed medical condition, especially in pediatric patients with congenital heart disease or complex medical conditions. If not diagnosed and treated in a timely and effective manner, blood clotting results in life-threatening complications. Many of these deaths can be avoided if appropriate risk assessments and preventive measures are applied.

According to the VA HSR&D Health Economics Resource Center, COPD ranks 5th among the 40 most common chronic clinical conditions in the U.S. Veteran patient population and is responsible for >14,000 VA hospital admission annually. Importantly, COPD is associated with frequent emergency room visitation and/or patient hospitalizations. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a common co- morbid condition that worsens morbidity and mortality in patients with COPD. This study will examine the potential for tadalafil, a phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor to improve functional status by decreasing PH. Results from this study are expected to define the potential use of PDE-5 inhibitors in COPD-induced PH. If successful, this treatment option may improve quality of life and outcomes for the large number of veterans afflicted with PH due to COPD.","1862837 (contact); 1962101; ","GOLDSTEIN, RONALD HOWARD (contact); ROUNDS, SHARON IRENE SMITH;","","07/01/2013","06/30/2018","Accident and Emergency department; Activities of Daily Living; Address; Admission activity; arteriole; Attenuated; Award; Bioavailable; Biological Availability; Blood Vessels; Boston; Cardiopulmonary; Chronic; Chronic Disease; Chronic lung disease; Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease; Clinical; Clinical Management; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials; Data Reporting; Development; Disease; Disease Progression; Double-Blind Method; Dyspnea; Echocardiography; Economic Burden; effective therapy; Enrollment; Ensure; Enzymes; evidence based guidelines; Exercise; exercise capacity; Failure; Frequencies; Functional disorder; functional status; Future; Gases; Gold; Guanosine Monophosphate; Health; health care service utilization; health economics; health related quality of life; Healthcare Systems; Heart failure; hemodynamics; Home environment; Homogeneously Staining Region; Hospital Readmission; Hospitalization; Hospitals; hypertension treatment; Hypoxia; improved; inhibitor/antagonist; innovation; Investigation; Left; Left Ventricular Function; Los Angeles; Lung; Lung diseases; Measures; Mechanics; Medical center; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Nitric Oxide; novel; Observational Study; Outcome; Outcome Measure; oxidant stress; Oxygen; Oxygen Consumption; Oxygen Therapy Care; patient population; Patients; Periodicity; Pharmacology; phosphoric diester hydrolase; Physiological; Placebo Control; Population; pressure; prevent; primary outcome; programs; prospective; public health relevance; pulmonary arterial hypertension; pulmonary artery endothelial cell; Pulmonary artery structure; Pulmonary Capillary Wedge Pressure; Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1; Pulmonary Hypertension; Pulmonary Vascular Resistance; Quality of life; Questionnaires; Randomized Clinical Trials; Randomized Controlled Trials; Relaxation; Research; Resources; Right Ventricular Function; Risk; Role; secondary outcome; Severities; Severity of illness; Signal Transduction; Site; Smooth Muscle Myocytes; social; Standardization; Systolic Pressure; tadalafil; targeted treatment; Testing; Therapeutic; treatment strategy; trend; two-dimensional; uptake; Vascular Diseases; Vascular remodeling; Vascular Smooth Muscle; vasoconstriction; Ventricular; Veterans; walkability; Wood material; World Health Organization; ","Tadalafil for Pulmonary Hypertension Associated with Chronic Lung Disease","000908","CLIN","Clinical Trials ","","","05","","","",""

The function of the induced human sensory neurons will be fully- characterized. This will provide a novel and unique opportunity to study the function of human pain neurons at a molecular and cellular level, and to determine what changes occur in sensory neurons derived from patients with specific diseases, and how. Furthermore, we will create mutations in genes known to cause pain, and explore the effects of this on human and mouse sensory neuron excitability and growth. The approach will enable detailed analysis of the cellular biology of pain and small fiber neuropathy, and can be used to screen for new treatments.","2282455; ","WOOLF, CLIFFORD J;","OSHINSKY, MICHAEL L","12/05/1998","06/30/2019","Action Potentials; Adult; Afferent Neurons; Agonist; Ascorbic Acid; base; Behavior; Blood specimen; Calcium; Capsaicin; carbene; Cell Line; Cell model; Cells; Cellular biology; Characteristics; chemotherapeutic agent; Congenital Pain Insensitivity; Data; Degenerative Disorder; Development; Disease; disease phenotype; disease-causing mutation; Embryo; embryonic stem cell; Engineering; Erythromelalgia; Evaluation; Exposure to; Fiber; Fibroblasts; gain of function mutation; gene correction; Gene Mutation; Gene Targeting; Generations; Genes; Genetic study; genome editing; Goals; Grant; Growth; Heterogeneity; Human; human disease; human embryonic stem cell; Human Genetics; induced pluripotent stem cell; Inherited; Instruction; loss of function mutation; Malignant Neoplasms; Measures; Membrane; Modeling; Molecular; Molecular Profiling; morphogens; Morphology; Motor Neurons; Mus; mustard oil; Mutation; nervous system disorder; neurite growth; Neurological Models; Neuronal Differentiation; Neurons; Neuropathy; Nociception; Nociceptors; novel; oxaliplatin; Pain; Patients; Pattern; Peripheral; Peripheral Nerves; Peripheral Nervous System; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases; peripheral pain; Phenotype; Protocols documentation; public health relevance; Reporter; Reporting; Resistance; response; Sensory; sensory system; small molecule inhibitor; Sodium; Somatic Cell; stem cell technology; Stem cells; superoxide dismutase 1; Techniques; Tetrodotoxin; Transcript; transcription factor; transdifferentiation; treatment strategy; TRPV1 gene; Work; ","Altered Sensibility Following Peripheral Nerve Damage","038253","SCS","Somatosensory and Chemosensory Systems Study Section ","","","18","313512","241404","554916",""

The current treatment option for AILI is limited to N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which has a narrow therapeutic time window, resulting in the loss of a significant proportion of patients. The long-term goal of this research project is to better understand the molecular mechanisms involved in AILI in order to identify new therapeutic agents that will complement NAC in the treatment of AILI. Previous work has demonstrated a hepato-protective function of hepatic M?s in AILI. Our recent data suggest that hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)2? may be important in mediating this protection. Successful completion of the proposed studies will not only provide insight into endogenous protective mechanisms during AILI, but also identify a potential therapeutic target. HIF can be pharmacologically activated by prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) inhibitors, which are currently used in clinical trials for the treatment of anemia and prevention of ischemia and reperfusion injury. Thus, HIF activation by PHD inhibitors could be swiftly translated into clinical studies in AILI patients.","8867181; 7732158 (contact); ","ELTZSCHIG, HOLGER K.; JU, CYNTHIA  (contact);","SERRANO, JOSE ","09/21/2016","06/30/2020","Accounting; Acetaminophen; acetaminophen overdose; Acetylcysteine; Acute Liver Failure; Advanced Development; Anemia; Antibodies; Antidotes; Attenuated; Cells; Clinic; Clinical; clinical application; Clinical Research; Clinical Treatment; Clinical Trials; Complement; cytokine; Data; Effectiveness; experimental study; Genetic Transcription; Goals; Hepatic; Hepatocyte; Hepatotoxicity; Hypoxia; Hypoxia Inducible Factor; hypoxia inducible factor 1; Imines; In Vitro; in vivo; Ingestion; inhibitor/antagonist; Injury; insight; Interleukin 6 Receptor; Interleukin-6; Knockout Mice; Knowledge; Kupffer Cells; Life; Liver; liver injury; Mediating; Medical center; medical specialties; Messenger RNA; mitochondrial dysfunction; Molecular; Mus; Myelogenous; Necrosis; novel; novel therapeutics; Overdose; overexpression; p-Benzoquinones; para-benzoquinone; Pathogenicity; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pharmacology; Play; Predisposition; Prevention; Procollagen-Proline Dioxygenase; Production; protective effect; Recruitment Activity; Reperfusion Injury; Reporting; Research; Research Project Grants; Role; Savings; screening; Signal Transduction; STAT3 gene; Stress; Symptoms; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Agents; therapeutic target; Time; tissue repair; Tissues; toxicant; Translating; United States; Work; ","Hypoxia-Inducible Factors in Acetaminophen-Induced Liver Injury.","109574","XNDA","Xenobiotic and Nutrient Disposition and Action Study Section ","","","02","298866","165871","464737",""

Therefore, targeted inhibition of Hh signaling has significant clinical implications in the treatment and prevention of many types of human cancers but requires a deeper mechanistic understanding about the role of Hh signaling in cancer cells as well as in cancer stroma. Through investigating the effects of Hh signaling on macrophage polarization and its contributions to the immunosuppressive milieu within the tumor microenvironment, we will define the molecular and cellular mechanisms of Hh-induced immune dysfunctions during tumorigenesis, identify targetable susceptibilities and potentially use this knowledge to develop novel cancer therapeutics to benefit public health.","14161720; ","PETTY, AMY JIAYUE;","DAMICO, MARK W","07/01/2017","06/30/2021","Affect; angiogenesis; Anti-inflammatory; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Basal cell carcinoma; cancer cell; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; CD8B1 gene; Cell Communication; Cell Differentiation process; Cell Lineage; Cell physiology; Cell Proliferation; cell type; Cells; Cellular Immunity; Cellular Structures; chemokine; clinically significant; Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes; Data; Development; Endothelial Cells; Erinaceidae; Event; Family; Fibroblasts; Functional disorder; Genetic Transcription; Goals; Growth; hepatoma cell; Heterogeneity; Human; Immune; Immune Evasion; Immune response; Immune System Diseases; Immunosuppressive Agents; Impairment; In Vitro; in vivo; Infiltration; insight; Knowledge; Lead; Ligands; Link; Literature; macrophage; malignant breast neoplasm; Malignant neoplasm of brain; Malignant neoplasm of gastrointestinal tract; Malignant neoplasm of liver; Malignant neoplasm of lung; Malignant neoplasm of pancreas; Malignant neoplasm of prostate; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; medulloblastoma; Modeling; Molecular; mouse model; Mus; Myelogenous; Myeloid Cells; Natural immunosuppression; Neoplasm Metastasis; novel; novel therapeutics; overexpression; paracrine; Pathway interactions; Phenotype; Predisposition; Prevention; Primary carcinoma of the liver cells; Public Health; Regulation; Role; SHH gene; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Skin Cancer; smoothened signaling pathway; Solid Neoplasm; Stimulus; Stromal Cells; Stromal Neoplasm; T cell response; T-Lymphocyte; Testing; Therapeutic; Tissues; transcription factor; tumor; tumor growth; Tumor Immunity; tumor microenvironment; Tumor-Derived; tumorigenesis; tumorigenic; Tumorigenicity; Up-Regulation; ","Role of hedgehog signaling in tumor-associated macrophage polarization","213799","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","01","35316","","35316",""

HIV remains a massive public health challenge both domestically and internationally; the HIV Care Continuum is a widely used and powerful epidemiologic framework applicable to those suffering from HIV, and the influence of public health and health system policies across the Continuum may be profound. By assessing the dynamic process of the HIV Care Continuum in discrete stages, and examining disparities by health policy, geography, and individual context, transitions that demand improvement and specific targets for public health and clinical interventions can more easily be identified. The US National HIV/AIDS Strategy (updated to 2020) and revised 2013 World Health Organization ART guidelines also reference milestones in the Care Continuum; because the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and other national health policies implemented in North and Latin American countries aim to improve healthcare access and reduce health disparities in accord with these milestones, describing the effect of policy and individual contextual factors on Care Continuum outcomes, as this study aims to do, will be of great interest and utility to epidemiologists, clinicians, and policy makers.","11483785; ","REBEIRO, PETER F;","MCKAIG, ROSEMARY G.","07/05/2017","06/30/2022","Accounting; Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Affordable Care Act; AIDS/HIV problem; American; antiretroviral therapy; Benchmarking; Canada; Caribbean region; CD4 Lymphocyte Count; Central America; Characteristics; Clinical; clinical care; cohort; Collaborations; contextual factors; Continuity of Patient Care; Country; Data; Data Sources; Demography; Diagnosis; Disease; Disease Outcome; disease transmission; Enrollment; Epidemiologist; Epidemiology; epidemiology study; geographic difference; geographic population; Geography; Goals; Guidelines; health care availability; health care disparity; health disparity; Health Policy; Health Services Accessibility; Health Status; Health system; Healthcare; HIV; HIV Infections; improved; Incidence; Individual; Information Systems; insight; Institute of Medicine (U.S.); interest; International; Intervention; Latin America; Latin American; Laws; Lead; lens; Longitudinal cohort; Measures; Medicaid; Mental disorders; Mexico; mortality; Movement; National Health Policy; North America; novel; Outcome; Pan American Health Organization; Patients; Pattern; Persons; Policies; Policy Maker; Population; Poverty; Process; Psychiatric Diagnosis; Public Health; public health relevance; Quasi-experiment; Research; Research Design; Risk; socioeconomics; Source; South America; Specific qualifier value; Structure; Time; Time trend; United States; Update; Urbanization; Viral; virology; Vulnerable Populations; Work; World Health Organization; ","The HIV Care Continuum and Health Policy: Changes through Context and Geography","131895","AIDS","Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Research Review Committee ","","A1","01","115479","9042","124521",""

In addition we will structurally resolve human sugar transporters from two different and essential classes that bear a tremendous pharmaceutical relevance in type II diabetes and other conditions related to sugar transport and metabolism.","8465152; ","ABRAMSON, JEFFREY S;","AINSZTEIN, ALEXANDRA M","07/01/2006","06/30/2019","absorption; Baculoviridae; Baculoviruses; Binding; Binding Sites; Biochemical; Biological Models; Biomedical Research; Biophysics; Blood Circulation; Capital; Carrier Proteins; Cell Line; Cells; Collaborations; Complement; conformational conversion; Congenital Disorders; Coupling; Crystallization; Crystallography; Cytoplasm; Data; Deer; Diabetes Mellitus; Dietary Monosaccharide; Disease; drug development; Drug usage; Electrons; Enterocytes; Environment; Equilibrium; experience; Family; Family member; Foundations; Galactose; Glucose; Glucose Plasma Concentration; Glucose Transporter; Goals; Golgi Apparatus; Grant; Homo sapiens; Hormonal; Human; Human body; human disease; hydrophilicity; Injectable; Insecta; Kidney; Label; Ligands; Lipids; Mammalian Cell; Maps; member; Membrane; Metabolic; Metabolism; Molecular Conformation; molecular dynamics; Monitor; Motion; Movement; movie; Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; novel; Organelles; Organism; Pathway interactions; Pharmacologic Substance; Physiology; Polysaccharides; Positioning Attribute; Process; Protein Family; protein structure; protein transport; Proteins; public health relevance; Pump; Reaction; Research; Resolution; restraint; Roentgen Rays; Role; Sampling; Series; Side; Site; Small Intestines; Sodium; solute; Source; Spectrum Analysis; Structure; sugar; sugar nucleotide; symporter; Time; Transmembrane Transport; Ursidae Family; Vibrio parahaemolyticus; virtual; Waxes; Work; x-ray free-electron laser; Yeasts; ","Disseminating the mechanism of sodium and galactose coupling in the sodium dependent galactose symporter, vSGLT","078844","BBM","Biochemistry and Biophysics of Membranes Study Section ","","S1","12","50484","27766","78250",""

Therefore, pre-clinical studi are critically important to demonstrate the feasibility and safety of stem cell based therapies. This application will 1) examine the stem cell properties and regenerative potential of Adark and Apale spermatogonia from prepubertal primate testes; 2) determine the effect of high dose chemotherapy on the SSC pool and somatic environment of the prepubertal primate testis and 3) establish the feasibility of using SSCs to preserve and restore fertility in a prepubertal prima model of cancer survivorship.","1964087; ","ORWIG, KYLE E;","TAYMANS, SUSAN ","06/01/2014","05/31/2019","Address; Age; Anatomy; Animal Model; Autologous; Biological Preservation; Biopsy; Bone Marrow Transplantation; boys; Busulfan; Cancer Model; Cancer Survivor; Cancer Survivorship; cancer therapy; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell physiology; Cell surface; Cell Survival; Cell Therapy; Cells; chemotherapy; Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure; childhood cancer survivor; Clinic; Clinical; clinically relevant; conditioning; Cyclophosphamide; cytotoxic; Data; Defect; Dose; Endocrine; Environment; experience; Exposure to; Fertility; Follicle Stimulating Hormone; Foundations; Freezing; Future; Gene Expression; GNRH1 gene; Gonadal structure; Health; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; High Dose Chemotherapy; high risk; Human; Hypothalamic structure; Infertility; innovation; insight; Knowledge; Lead; leydig interstitial cell; Life; Luteinizing Hormone; Macaca mulatta; male; Male Infertility; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; men; Micromanipulation; Mind; Modeling; Monkeys; Morphology; Natural regeneration; Non-Malignant; nonhuman primate; novel; Nuclear; Nude Mice; patient population; Patients; Physiology; Pituitary Gland; Plants; Population; pre-clinical; preclinical study; Precocious Puberty; Pregnancy; prepuberty; Primates; Production; programs; Proliferating; Property; Puberty; public health relevance; Radiation; Radiation therapy; Recovery; regenerative; Regulation; Research; Research Institute; Rodent; Safety; Schedule; sertoli cell; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; sperm cell; Spermatogenesis; Spermatogonia; Staining method; Stains; stem cell niche; stem cell population; stem cell technology; stem cell therapy; Stem cell transplant; Stem cells; targeted treatment; Techniques; Technology; Testicular Tissue; Testing; Testis; Testosterone; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Intervention; Tissues; Toxic effect; transcriptome sequencing; Translating; Transplantation; United States; Walkers; Whole-Body Irradiation; Woman; Xenograft procedure; ","Cellular Mechanisms of Chemotherapy-induced Male Infertility: Stem Cell or Niche?","076412","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","04","484432","138604","623036",""

Mutations of these proteins, and another muscle protein called Stac3, result in serious muscle diseases in humans, including hypokalemic periodic paralysis and central core disease.

These bacteria grow directly inside of human host cells and use their niche inside of human cells to 'hide out' from antibodies that the immune system normally generates to fight infections. The short-term goal of this research is to understand how Listeria monocytogenes are able to invade human cells and move from the inside of one human cell to another, with a long-term goal of finding better methods to prevent or treat serious bacterial infections.","1859170; ","THERIOT, JULIE A.;","MILLS, MELODY ","07/01/2015","06/30/2020","Actins; Address; Antibodies; arm; Award; Bacteria; Bacterial Genes; Bacterial Infections; Behavior; Biochemical; Biological Models; Biophysical Process; biophysical properties; Blood - brain barrier anatomy; Blood Vessels; Brain; Bypass; Cell Differentiation process; Cell Line; cell motility; Cell Wall; Cells; Cellular Structures; Complex; crosslink; Cytoplasm; Diffuse; Disease; Dissection; Distal; Elderly; Endothelial Cells; Endothelium; Entropy; Epithelial Cells; fighting; Food Poisoning; foodborne infection; Genetic; Goals; Gram-Positive Bacteria; Growth; Human; Immune; Immune response; Immune system; Immunocompromised Host; Infection; Intestines; Invaded; Lead; Listeria monocytogenes; Listeriosis; Liver; macrophage; mathematical model; Mediating; Membrane; Membrane Proteins; Meningitis; Methods; Modeling; Molecular; Molecular Genetics; monolayer; mouse model; Movement; Mus; nanoscale; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neuraxis; Newborn Infant; Organism; pathogen; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Phase; physical property; Placenta; polarized cell; polymerization; Polymers; Pregnant Women; prevent; Process; Property; Protein Secretion; Proteins; reconstitution; Research; Role; screening; single molecule; Site; Small Interfering RNA; Spontaneous abortion; Staphylococcus aureus; Structure; Surface; System; Tail; Testing; Thick; tissue culture; Tissues; Virulence Factors; Work; ","Actin-Based Motility of a Bacterial Pathogen","036929","NSS","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","24","193147","114324","307471",""

The proposed research is relevant to public health and to PA-12-175 (Multidisciplinary Studies of HIV/AIDS and Aging) because it proposes a new paradigm of obstructive lung disease in HIV that links aging and chronic immune activation to lung function abnormalities in HIV-infected persons. The proposal will fill the gap i knowledge of the epidemiology of aging and pulmonary disease in HIV as well as elucidate pulmonary effects of physiologic and cellular aging in HIV.

Unfortunately this treatment is associated with progressive cognitive decline, which impairs quality of life especially in long-term cancer survivors. Previous studies suggest that post-irradiation cognitive impairment may be due to persistent reductions in adult hippocampal neurogenesis, a function which is integral to learning and memory. Few treatments have demonstrated an ability to mitigate the detrimental effect of irradiation on adult hippocampal neurogenesis and little is known how discrete steps in the neurogenic process are specifically impaired. The goal of this study is to characterize changes that occur in different neurogenic cell populations after irradiation and pharmaceutically manipulate pathways that regulate neural stem cell division in an attempt to rescue post-irradiation neurogenesis. Results from this study may contribute to the development of future therapies to mitigate cognitive decline after cranial radiotherapy.","12368542; ","BELCHER, ELIZABETH ;","BABCOCK, DEBRA J.","04/01/2017","07/31/2019","Achievement; Acute; Adult; adult stem cell; Adverse effects; Age; aged; Animal Experimentation; Animals; Apoptotic; Biological Models; BMP2 gene; BMP6 gene; bone morphogenetic protein receptors; bone morphogenic protein; Brain; Brain Neoplasms; Bromodeoxyuridine; Cancer Survivor; Cell Death; Cell division; cell type; Cells; Cephalic; Common Neoplasm; Cranial Irradiation; Data; dentate gyrus; Development; experimental study; Fellowship; Future; Goals; granule cell; Hippocampus (Brain); Immunohistochemistry; Impaired cognition; Impairment; improved; Individual; Infusion Pumps; inhibitor/antagonist; Intraventricular; Intraventricular Infusion; Investigation; irradiation; Laboratories; Lead; Learning; Maps; Measures; Memory; Messenger RNA; Modeling; mood regulation; mRNA Expression; Mus; nerve stem cell; nestin protein; neuroblast; neurogenesis; Neuroglia; Neuronal Plasticity; Neurons; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pharmacologic Substance; Population; Population Sizes; Positioning Attribute; Postdoctoral Fellow; Process; protein expression; Quality of life; Radial; Radiation; Radiation exposure; Radiation therapy; radioresistant; Reporter; Research; response; Role; skills; Source; stem cell division; Stem cells; Techniques; Testing; therapy development; Transgenic Organisms; Work; ","Rescuing neurogenesis after irradiation: radial glial cells and a role for bone morphogenic protein inhibitors","101750","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","44044","","44044",""

Interestingly, a newly identified gene called ampG is required for multiple mechanisms of resistance against the penicillins, making this an ideal target for the control of antibiotic resistance. In this proposal we intend to uncover the molecular details of AmpG-mediated control of the resistance and identify chemical compounds that can block AmpG function, with the ultimate goal of developing new combinatory antimicrobial drugs which not only can control pathogens that are already resistant to penicillins but also bring ineffective penicillins back to life in clinics.","1884123 (contact); 8744831; ","JIN, SHOUGUANG  (contact); SCAMPAVIA, LOUIS DANIEL;","LU, KRISTINA ","07/03/2015","06/30/2020","Address; Affinity; Animals; Antibiotic Resistance; Antibiotics; antimicrobial; antimicrobial drug; Back; Bacteria; Bacterial Infections; bacterial resistance; beta-Lactam Resistance; beta-Lactamase; beta-Lactams; Biological Assay; Cell Membrane Permeability; Cell Wall; Cephalosporinase; Cephalosporins; Chemicals; Chemistry; Chromosomes; Clavulanic Acids; Clinic; Clinical; clinical application; Cystic Fibrosis; cystic fibrosis patients; cytotoxicity; Development; Dose; drug discovery; Drug Kinetics; drug metabolism; Effectiveness; efflux pump; Evaluation; Failure; fight against; Gene Expression; Generations; Genes; Goals; Gram-Negative Bacteria; Hospitals; Hour; Immunity; Immunocompromised Host; improved; Infection; inhibitor/antagonist; Knock-out; knockout gene; Lactamase; Lactams; Lead; Libraries; Life; Mediating; Membrane; Membrane Transport Proteins; miniaturize; Modeling; Molecular; Monobactams; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; mutant; Mutation; overexpression; pathogen; Patients; Penicillin Resistance; Penicillin-Binding Proteins; Penicillins; Peptidoglycan; permease; Phase; Process; Pseudomonas; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Pseudomonas Infections; public health relevance; Recycling; Reporter; Research Institute; Resistance; Resistance development; resistance frequency; resistance mechanism; response; Roter; screening; Solubility; synergism; System; Techniques; Testing; Therapeutic; ","Countering beta-lactam resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa","119043","ZAI1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","03","438000","75000","513000",""

The VA has programs to provide housing assistance and supportive services to homeless Veterans. However, providing housing is only the starting point, not the end-point, for successful community integration. Other aspects of community integration (e.g., work, social contact, independent living) usually remain unchanged even after housing is achieved.

Most signals are received by cells at the plasma membrane, which forms the physical barrier and functional interface between a cell and its environment. Membranes also delimit the many subcellular compartments that expand the functionality of eukaryotic cells. The signaling and structural functions of these cellular membranes are dependent in large part on their lipid compositions, thus it is unsurprising that lipid imbalances are associated with a variety of disorders, most notably cardiovascular disease. Moreover, dietary lipid intake and composition is an important contributor to health, with overconsumption of cholesterol, saturated, and trans-unsaturated fats being major disease risk factors, while ?-3 polyunsaturated fats are broadly beneficial. Remarkably, despite the clear impact of membrane phenotypes on health and disease, very little detailed information is available on the membrane lipids that define these phenotypes, or how they influence cell function. We are investigating the compositional complexity and plasticity of human cell membranes, and the regulation of these by dietary lipids. The long-term goals of these investigations are to define the differences between 'healthy' and 'unhealthy' membranes and identify drugs and dietary factors to inhibit deleterious membrane properties and/or promote desired phenotypes.","8145040; ","LEVENTAL, ILYA ;","AINSZTEIN, ALEXANDRA M","07/01/2015","06/30/2020","Address; Adipocytes; Affect; Alzheimer's Disease; analytical tool; Animals; Autoimmunity; Bioinformatics; Biological; biophysical properties; Biophysics; bone morphogenetic protein 2; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cell Differentiation process; Cell Lineage; Cell membrane; Cell physiology; Cells; Cellular Membrane; Cholesterol; Data; Dementia; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; Diet; Dietary Factors; Dietary Fats; Disease; disease phenotype; disorder risk; Docosahexaenoic Acids; Environment; Enzymatic Biochemistry; Eukaryotic Cell; Exogenous Factors; experimental study; Family; fluidity; Goals; Growth Factor Receptors; Health; Homeostasis; Human; human disease; Intake; Intervention; Investigation; Lateral; Length; lipid metabolism; Lipids; macromolecule; Malignant Neoplasms; Mass Spectrum Analysis; Measures; Mediating; Membrane; Membrane Lipids; Membrane Microdomains; Mesenchymal Differentiation; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Methodology; Molecular; Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins; Nature; nervous system disorder; Normal Cell; Omega-3 Fatty Acids; Osteoblasts; osteogenic; Osteoporosis; Output; Pathway interactions; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacologic Substance; Pharmacology; Phenotype; physical property; Plasticizers; polyunsaturated fat; Predisposition; Property; Proteins; public health relevance; Regulation; Research; Risk Factors; saturated fat; Signal Transduction; Somatomedins; stem cell biology; stem cell differentiation; Structure; System; Testing; Time; tool; transmission process; Unsaturated Fats; Virus Diseases; ","Lipidomic, biophysical, and functional differentiation of Mesenchymal Stem Cell membranes","114282","BBM","Biochemistry and Biophysics of Membranes Study Section ","","","03","237161","125628","362789",""

At times this delicate process is disturbed during development leading to cortical malformations, such as lissencephaly, which is caused by mutations in the X-linked gene doublecortin (DCX). Lissencephaly patients suffer from severe impairments, including mental retardation and intractable epilepsy. We study the basic, cellular roles that DCX plays in young neurons during development to ensure proper migration, axon and dendrite outgrowth, which ultimately underlie the formation of correct functional circuitry. Our work seeks to uncover the fundamental cellular processes that are regulated by DCX. Understanding the cellular bases of DCX function is relevant to human health because it will lead to an increased ability to understand the causes of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as lissencephaly. The hope is that understanding the underlying causes of disease will open avenues for therapeutic intervention in the future.","1875155; ","WINCKLER, BETTINA R;","RIDDLE, ROBERT D.","07/15/2013","06/30/2018","adhesion receptor; Alleles; Area; Attention; Axon; axon growth; axon guidance; base; Binding; Biological Assay; Brain; Cell Adhesion; Cell Adhesion Molecules; Cell physiology; Cell surface; cell type; Cells; Cellular Membrane; Cerebral cortex; Clathrin; Clathrin Adaptors; cognitive function; Complex; Cortical Malformation; Cytoskeletal Modeling; Data; Defect; Dendrites; Development; Disease; Dynamin; Electroporation; Embryo; Endocytosis; Endocytosis Pathway; Ensure; Epilepsy; experimental study; Future; Genes; Genetic; Goals; Grant; Growth; Health; Heart; Human; Impairment; In-Migration; Individual; Intractable Epilepsy; knock-down; Knock-out; Link; lissencephaly; malformation; Mediating; Membrane; Membrane Proteins; Mental Retardation; Microtubules; migration; Molecular; Morphogenesis; Morphology; Mus; mutant; Mutation; nervous system disorder; neurodevelopment; Neurodevelopmental Disorder; neurofascin; Neurons; Newborn Infant; newborn neuron; novel; Pathway interactions; Patients; Phenotype; Play; Positioning Attribute; Process; Proteins; public health relevance; Publishing; Rattus; receptor; Regulation; relating to nervous system; Research; Resistance; RNA Interference; Role; Route; Signal Transduction; Surface; Synapses; Testing; Therapeutic Intervention; Time; tool; trafficking; uptake; Work; ","Multifunctional roles for doublecortin (DCX)in neural development","081674","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","05","231350","116725","348075",""

Alcohol produces neuronal adaptations that underlie functional tolerance-while ethanol is on board-and symptoms of withdrawal after ethanol clearance.

The proposed research is relevant to public health because we will describe the molecular origins of these early alcohol responses.

Individuals with NCC present seizures from the parasitic lesions, but in some patients parasites might be involved in epileptogenesis by inducing hippocampal damage, which can become the site of seizure onset. Working with an ongoing cohort of 228 patients with calcified brain cysticercosis as well as with controls without NCC, we will attempt to demonstrate the association between NCC and hippocampal sclerosis, and to characterize the clinical, neurophysiological, and neuroimaging characteristics associated with hippocampal sclerosis in these individuals. If NCC-associated hippocampal sclerosis is the epileptogenic region, and is similar to the HS in MTLE, it would provide a unique opportunity to study epileptogenesis clinically for the most common form of intractable epilepsy.","8445440; ","GARCIA, HECTOR HUGO;","STEWART, RANDALL R","07/01/2016","06/30/2018","Antigens; Atrophic; base; Bilateral; Brain; calcification; Calcified; Cerebral Calcification; Cerebrum; Characteristics; Chronic; Clinical; cohort; Collaborations; computational morphometry; Control Groups; Cysticercosis; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Diffuse; Ecuador; Electroencephalography; Epilepsy; Epileptogenesis; Focal Seizure; Frequencies; Future; General Population; Goals; Health; hippocampal sclerosis; Hippocampus (Brain); Hispanics; Human; Individual; Infection; Inflammatory; Intervention; Intractable Epilepsy; Larva; Lesion; Location; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Measures; Modeling; morphometry; neocortical; Nervous system structure; Neurocysticercosis; neuroimaging; neurophysiology; Parasites; Participant; Pathology; patient population; Patients; Pattern; Perinatal Brain Injury; Peru; Population; Prevalence; Recording of previous events; Refractory; Research Design; Risk Factors; Seizures; Site; Spinal; Suggestion; Taenia solium; Temporal Lobe Epilepsy; Thick; Traumatic Brain Injury; Visual; working group; ","Characterization of hippocampal sclerosis in individuals with calcified Neurocysticercosis","094976","ANIE","Acute Neural Injury and Epilepsy Study Section ","","","02","118850","5812","124662",""

The use of multiple designs and methodologies across levels of analysis will provide a strong basis for targeting delay discounting and translating episodic future thinking into interventions to prevent Type 2 diabetes and improve control of comorbidities in those at risk for developing Type 2 diabetes.","1860001; 1868010 (contact); ","BICKEL, WARREN K; EPSTEIN, LEONARD H (contact);","HUNTER, CHRISTINE ","09/01/2015","06/30/2018","Adherence; Adult; Anterior; assay development; Basic Science; Behavior; behavior change; Behavioral; Brain; Brain region; candidate marker; Chronic Disease; cingulate cortex; Clinical; Clinical Trials; Comorbidity; Control Groups; Cross-Sectional Studies; Cues; Decision Making; design; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; diabetes prevention program; Diagnosis; discount; discounting; Disease; Disease Marker; Disease Progression; Dyslipidemias; Eating; Energy Intake; Episodic memory; Event; executive function; exhibitions; Exhibits; experience; Experimental Designs; field study; Food; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Future; glycemic control; Goals; Gold; Grant; Health; Health behavior; Health behavior change; Healthy Eating; healthy lifestyle; high risk; Hippocampus (Brain); Hypertension; improved; Individual; Informal Social Control; interest; Intervention; Laboratories; Laboratory Study; Lateral; Life Style; Measures; Medical; medication compliance; Medicine; Metabolic Control; Methodology; Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; novel; Obesity; Observational Study; Outcome; Participant; Patients; Persons; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Physical activity; pleasure; Population; Poverty; Prediabetes syndrome; Prefrontal Cortex; Preparation; prevent; Prevention; Preventive; Procedures; Process; programs; prospective; public health relevance; Randomized; Rationalization; Regimen; relating to nervous system; Research; Rewards; Risk; Science; sedentary; Self Management; Series; Short-Term Memory; simulation; Smoking Behavior; Taste Perception; Testing; Thinking; Time; Translating; Validation; Weight; ","Delay discounting as a target for self-regulation in prediabetes","109543","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","03","618847","145658","764505",""

The metabolic syndrome is a combination of health problems that many patients with diabetes possess. We plan to investigate which of these health problems contributes to the development of neuropathy. If we can determine which of these factors contribute to this common condition, then we will be able to target these areas with specific medications.

The ability to sequence and analyze the long and deceptively simple stretches of linear base pairs (the As, Gs, Cs and Ts that make up our DNA) has accelerated rapidly in recent years, with the introduction of new technologies, approaches and applications. The cost of sequencing entire genomes has dropped precipitously, so that scientists are now able to sequence tens, hundreds or even thousands of individual members of a species, thus beginning to understand how organisms within a species vary genetically, and how this variation lies at the heart of individual susceptibility to the environment, diseases etc.  The Cold Spring Harbor courses are by design short advanced training programs in which students - typically graduate students, postdocs and junior faculty - work closely with faculty to gain familiarity with the latest techniques and concepts in the given field. The need for training in advanced sequencing technologies and applications is particularly relevant because of the extraordinary pace of change in this field.

Over 90% of GWV with GWI report significant activity limitations and over 70% report chronic cognitive problems consistent with problem-solving deficits. Problem-solving is considered the most complex of cognitive abilities and is what enables us to conduct complicated behaviors such as setting goals, sequencing and multi-tasking. As a result, studies have found that problem-solving deficits are prospectively related to a 1.5 times greater risk of disability. Despite published reports documenting these problems there are no treatments that target the problem-solving deficits of GWI. This proposal seeks to determine whether Problem-Solving Therapy, a patient-centered cognitive rehabilitation therapy, can reduce disability by compensating for problem-solving deficits.","10205569; ","MCANDREW, LISA MARIE;","","07/01/2014","06/30/2017","Address; Adherence; Affect; Behavior; Chronic; Clinical Trials; Cognitive; cognitive ability; cognitive rehabilitation; Cognitive Therapy; Coin; Complex; Congestive Heart Failure; Dimensions; disability; Disease; Educational process of instructing; Equipment and supply inventories; Exercise; Exertion; Fatigue; Goals; Gulf War; Health education; Impaired cognition; Impairment; improved; innovation; Life; Malignant Neoplasms; Massachusetts; Measures; Mediating; Medical; multitask; neuropsychological; Neuropsychology; New Jersey; New York; Pain; patient oriented; Patient Self-Report; Patients; physical symptom; Population; Problem Solving; problem solving therapy; prospective; public health relevance; Publishing; Randomized Controlled Trials; Recruitment Activity; Rehabilitation therapy; Report (document); Reporting; Risk; Sampling; Site; skills; Structure; Symptoms; Syndrome; targeted treatment; Telephone; Therapeutic Intervention; Time; two-dimensional; Veterans; World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule; ","Cognitive Rehabilitation for Gulf War Illness","001053","SPLD","Special Emphasis - Research on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses ","","","04","","","",""

However, cancers that have a hereditary BRCA1 mutation, or have reduced expression of this gene, display hypersensitivity to platinum-based drugs, but the vast majority of cancers do not display attenuated or loss of BRCA1 function. We believe that cell cycle blockade is a strategy that will downregulate BRCA1 to induce a state of BRCAness, which then will sensitize tumor cells, including drug resistant cells, to agents, such as cisplatin and olaparib, either as single agents or in combinations.","1899544; ","SIDDIK, ZAHID H;","KONDAPAKA, SUDHIR B","07/06/2017","05/31/2022","Address; adduct; Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose; analog; base; Base Excision Repairs; Binding; Binding Sites; Biochemical; Biological Assay; Biological Markers; Bladder; Bortezomib; BRCA1 gene; BRCA1 Mutation; Bromodomain; Cancer Patient; Carboplatin; CCNE1 gene; CDK2 gene; CDK4 gene; CDKN1C gene; Cell Cycle; Cell Cycle Arrest; Cell Cycle Regulation; Cells; Cisplatin; Clinic; Complex; Consensus; Cyclin D1; Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor 2A; cytokine; Cytotoxic agent; Dasatinib; Data; Defect; desensitization; DNA; DNA Adduction; DNA Adducts; DNA Double Strand Break; DNA Repair; DNA Repair Inhibition; Down-Regulation; Drug resistance; E2F transcription factors; E2F1 gene; Event; expectation; Functional disorder; G1 Arrest; G1/S Arrest; Gene Expression; gene repression; Genes; Goals; Harvest; Head and neck structure; Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor; homologous recombination; Hypersensitivity; Immunoprecipitation; in vivo; Inherited; inhibitor/antagonist; knock-down; Knock-out; Knowledge; Lead; Link; Lung; malignant breast neoplasm; Malignant neoplasm of ovary; Malignant neoplasm of testis; Malignant Neoplasms; mathematical model; Mediating; Mitosis; Modeling; Molecular; multicatalytic endopeptidase complex; mutant; neoplastic cell; Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma; novel; Nucleotide Excision Repair; Ovarian; oxaliplatin; Pathway interactions; patient population; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacology; Phenotype; Phosphorylation; Phosphotransferases; Platinum; Polymerase; Process; promoter; prospective; protein degradation; Proteins; Rationalization; Refractory; Regimen; Regulation; repaired; Reporting; Resistance; response; Retinoblastoma Protein; Role; Small Interfering RNA; small molecule; Solid; success; Surgical incisions; survival outcome; synergism; System; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Agents; therapeutic target; therapy resistant; tool; TP53 gene; Transcription Repressor/Corepressor; Transforming Growth Factor beta; Treatment Efficacy; triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma; tumor; Tumor Cell Line; Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor; Up-Regulation; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-3; Xenograft procedure; ","Cell Cycle Blockade and Therapeutic Sensitization","211975","DMP","Drug Discovery and Molecular Pharmacology Study Section ","","A1","01","228750","137250","366000",""

Item 8. Project Narrative/Public Health Relevance The proposed training program is relevant to the public health because injuries that workers sustain on the job have important implications for their lives outside of work, including their financial situation (Foley et al. 2007), as well as implications for costs incurred by states, employers, and other entities (Dembe 2001, Weil 2001, Costich 2010). Workers who either permanently or temporarily cannot perform their occupational tasks may also not be able to perform tasks at home, including caregiving tasks for children or for a parent or other family member who requires support in order to remain living in a private setting, rather than an institution (Franche et al. 2006); extra burdens on family members may result in them developing musculoskeletal disorders and incurring associated healthcare costs (Asfaw et al. 2015). Engineers have the power to affect the health and safety of workers, but an appreciation of this requires special training and education, such as that provided through our Master's level Training Program in Safety & Ergonomics, in order to increase their ability to exert positive effects on worker safety and health; thus the relevance of this program to the public health.","1875100; ","SOMMERICH, CAROLYN M;","MAPLES, ELIZABETH ","07/01/2016","06/30/2021","","Occupational Safety and Health Training Grant : MS ISE/ Safety and Ergonomics","008847","ZOH1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","S1","12","","","22487",""

One of the hallmarks of aging is the decline in the ability of tissues to perform all of these functions. Therefore, understanding how stem cells change with age may provide insights into the basic mechanisms of aging. The studies of this proposal are designed to examine the molecular mechanisms that regulate stem cell functions in adult mice and how those mechanisms change with age, examining stem cells from three different tissues ? muscle, brain, and blood. We will focus on the epigenetic changes influence how functional the stem cells are in terms of tissue homeostasis and repair. Ultimately, our goal is to indentify ways to prevent the age-related decline in stem cell function and to restore youthful function to aged stem cells.","1878892; ","RANDO, THOMAS A.;","KOHANSKI, RONALD A.","07/01/2011","05/31/2022","Adult; Age; age related; aged; Aging; Aging-Related Process; Animals; Applications Grants; Area; ATAC-seq; Bioinformatics; bisulfite sequencing; Blood; Brain; Caloric Restriction; Cell Aging; Cell Compartmentation; Cell Lineage; Cell physiology; Cells; Characteristics; ChIP-seq; Chromatin; Clonal Expansion; cohort; Complement; Consensus Sequence; Creativeness; CRISPR/Cas technology; Data Analyses; Data Set; design; Development; dietary restriction; DNA Methylation; Elderly; Epigenetic Process; epigenome; epigenomics; Exercise; Foundations; Genes; Genetic Models; Genetic Transcription; Goals; Health; Hematopoietic stem cells; Hematopoietic System; Homeostasis; in vivo; Injury; innovation; insight; International; Intervention; Laboratories; Laboratory Study; Leadership; Longevity; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; Methodology; Modeling; Modification; Molecular; Mus; Muscle; Muscle satellite cell; Natural regeneration; nerve stem cell; Parabiosis; Phenotype; Population; Population Study; pressure; prevent; Process; Program Research Project Grants; programs; Records; regenerative; Regenerative Medicine; Regulation; Rejuvenation; repaired; Research Personnel; response; response to injury; restoration; sharing data; single cell analysis; Sirolimus; Skin; stem cell population; Stem cells; Stress; Structure; Study models; Technology; Testing; Therapeutic; Tissues; transcriptome; transcriptome sequencing; transcriptomics; whole genome; Work; Writing; ","Molecular Regulation of Stem Cell Aging","036695","ZAG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","06","1826774","384749","2211523",""

Directing the formation of these neuron-specific complexes in human skin cells can convert them to functional neurons opening new avenues for disease modeling, drug testing and perhaps replacement of damaged neurons.

This will be compared to standard radiation therapy and it will ultimately tell us if, how and when we need to intervene with the immune system so as to maximize therapeutic benefit, all of which has immense potential to assist the cancer community.","10652861; ","SCHAUE, DORTHE ;","AHMED, MANSOOR M","07/01/2015","06/30/2020","Address; Affect; Aftercare; Androgens; Antibodies; Biological Assay; Biological Markers; Blood Platelets; Cancer Patient; cancer radiation therapy; cancer therapy; CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes; CD8B1 gene; Cells; chemotherapy; Clinical; Clinical Trials; Color; Communities; Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes; Data; deprivation; design; Development; Disease; Disease Progression; Dose; Dose Fractionation; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Enzymes; Epitopes; Equilibrium; Erythrocytes; exhibitions; Exhibits; Flow Cytometry; FOLH1 gene; Fractionation; Frequencies; Helper-Inducer T-Lymphocyte; High-LET Radiation; Human; Humor; Immune; Immune response; Immune system; Immunologic Adjuvants; Immunologic Monitoring; Immunologics; Immunotherapy; Impact evaluation; Individual; individual patient; Inflammatory; innovation; Institution; Irradiated tumor; Leukocytes; Link; Longitudinal Studies; Lymphoid; Malignant neoplasm of prostate; Malignant Neoplasms; Measures; Mediating; Methods; Monitor; monocyte; Myelogenous; Natural immunosuppression; Natural Killer Cells; neutrophil; Outcome; Paint; Patient Selection; Patients; Peptides; Phenotype; Prostate Cancer therapy; Prostate-Specific Antigen; prostatic fraction Acid phosphatase isoenzyme; Prostatic Neoplasms; public health relevance; Radiation; Radiation Oncology; Radiation therapy; Reactive Oxygen Species; Regimen; Regulatory T-Lymphocyte; response; response biomarker; Sampling; Schedule; Selection for Treatments; Serum Markers; Shapes; Side; Signal Transduction; success; Suppressor-Effector T-Lymphocytes; survivin; Systemic Therapy; T-Lymphocyte; Technology; Testing; Therapeutic; Thinking; Time; Tissues; translational study; treatment planning; Treatment Protocols; tumor; Tumor Antigens; Tumor Burden; Tumor Immunity; Variant; Work; ","Radiotherapy-induced tumor immunity","191234","RTB","Radiation Therapeutics and Biology Study Section ","","","03","228750","123525","352275",""

We will then test whether cognitive performance among stenosis patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy will improve more in those with impaired cerebral perfusion at baseline versus those with normal baseline perfusion. Cognitive impairment is of increasing interest in our aging Veteran population. Demonstration of the reversibility of cerebral blood flow dysregulation and cognitive impairment would lead to a major shift in treatment algorithms of carotid artery disease in thousands of Veterans each year. If cognitive decline can be reversed in these patients, we will have established a new indication for carotid revascularization independent of stroke prevention.

Second, we will develop a two-photon microscope for behaving higher mammals that will allow one to monitor these signals with cellular resolution and complement current imaging techniques with larger coverage but coarser resolution. Finally, we will develop methods for writing neural population codes in functional maps by combining patterned light stimulation that target specific functional domains and selective expression of genetically encoded actuators.

Three of the most widely replicated and potentially modifiable protective factors linked to psychological resilience are emotion regulation, positive emotions, and the ability to harness social support. However, little is known about the function of neural circuits that underlie these key psychological domains associated with resilience. In this study, we will employ functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare functional neurocircuitry underlying these core psychological domains in highly resilient World Trade Center (WTC) responders compared to (1) symptomatic responders with chronic, clinically significant, WTC- related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and (2) low-exposed control responders with low WTC exposure and without any psychiatric history. Characterization of the functional neurocircuitry underlying emotion regulation, positive emotions, and the ability to harness social support in highly resilient WTC responders is critical to elucidating the etiology of psychological resilience, as well as to informing personalized prevention and treatment approaches that bolster function of specific neural circuits in WTC and other disaster responders, and other populations of trauma survivors.","9258739 (contact); 11693214; 10641391; ","FEDER, ADRIANA  (contact); PEREZ RODRIGUEZ, MARIA DE LAS MERCEDES ; PIETRZAK, ROBERT H;","KUBALE, TRAVIS ","07/01/2017","06/30/2021","","Neuroimaging of Resilience in World Trade Center Responders: A Focus on Emotional Processing, Reward and Social Cognition","011473","ZOH1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","","","599086",""

Current methods for cell preparation are unsatisfactory because they 1) require a significant investment of time, money and/or training; 2) require multiple protocols; and/or 3) result in a poor yield of viable cells, which is particularly problematic for scarce clinical specimens. SynderBio proposes to develop a novel proprietary method for preparing single, viable cell suspensions faster, cheaper and of higher quality than is currently possible and to thereby expand the utility of single-cell sequencing?greatly improving human health while addressing a multi-billion-dollar market.","14869862; ","CABLE, MICHAEL ;","SMITH, MICHAEL ","07/05/2017","12/31/2017","Address; Basic Science; Biochemical; Biological Sciences; Biology; cell preparation; Cell Separation; Cell Survival; cell type; Cell Viability Process; Cells; Characteristics; Clinical; commercial application; commercialization; Communities; Companions; Complex; Data; design; Development; Devices; Diagnostic; Disease; Dissociation; Elements; Emerging Technologies; Enteral; Excision; Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting; Genomic DNA; Genomics; Goals; Health; Human; improved; Industry Collaboration; innovation; instrumentation; Investments; Label; Laboratories; Liquid substance; Malignant Neoplasms; malignant neurologic neoplasms; Marketing; Methods; nervous system disorder; new technology; next generation sequencing; novel; novel diagnostics; Nucleic acid sequencing; One-Step dentin bonding system; Outcome; Performance; Phase; phase 1 study; phase 2 study; Physiologic pulse; Population; Preparation; prospective; Protocols documentation; prototype; Public Health; Publications; Publishing; Research; research and development; response; RNA; Sales; Sampling; sequencing platform; shear stress; Side; single cell sequencing; Small Business Innovation Research Grant; Specimen; Suspensions; Technology; Testing; Time; Tissues; Training; Work; ","Improved preparation of cell suspensions for single cell genomics","009877","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","","","218782",""
