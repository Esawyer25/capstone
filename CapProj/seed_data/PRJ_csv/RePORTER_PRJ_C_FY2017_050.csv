Growth hormone   deficiency and other pituitary hormone abnormalities that occur with high frequency as a result of   civilian mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) are associated with fatigue, insomnia, depression, decreased   muscle volume and strength, decreased sex drive, social isolation, and impairments of learning and   memory.

TBM presents with dynamic airway collapse and respiratory difficulties. In severe cases, TBM results in acute life-threatening events and even death. We have developed a bioresorbable splint for TBM that can be custom designed for patient specific anatomy and custom designed to have specific mechanical properties. The splint is fabricated using a 3D printing process which we have developed for bioresorbable PCL. To improve safety and efficacy of the splint, it is critical to investigate design and 3D printing fabrication effects on the long-term fatigue and degradation of the splint. In addition, the FDA also saw a need for more preclinical data on long term splint degradation and how this degradation affects splint and airway mechanics. We are currently going forward with plans to perform a clinical trial on the splint. We will evaluate degradation both in vitro and in a large in vivo preclinical model, the Yorkshire Pig. We will further perform finite element modeling of malacic airways with the splint to determine how degradation affects mechanical stimulation of the airway.

In the spirit of NEI?s Audacious Goals program, designed ?to restore vision through regeneration of neurons and neural connections in the eye and visual system,? we propose to combine state-of-the-art stem cell methodologies with high content screening approaches to discover novel small molecules and molecular pathways that promote human photoreceptor axonal outgrowth and synapse formation. If successful, the discovery of such molecules and pathways would greatly aid in the development of viable approaches to restore vision to individuals suffering from photoreceptor damage and degeneration.","7601285; 1895090 (contact); ","GAMM, DAVID M; ZACK, DONALD J.

Yet, there are no drugs available today that specifically target any of the major steps in the metastatic cascade. In this project, we seek to understand extravasation, the process by which tumor cells adhere to the walls of a blood vessel and escape into the surrounding tissues. We propose fundamental studies into the mechanisms of tumor cell extravasation, the forces and adhesions that enable it and effects this has on the gene expression profile of the extravasated cell. These studies will suggest new therapeutic targets to inhibit extravasation and provide new microfluidic assays that can be used in drug screening.","1961918; ","KAMM, ROGER D.;","KUHN, NASTARAN Z","09/22/2015","08/31/2020","Address; Adhesions; Atomic Force Microscopy; Basement membrane; Biological Assay; Blood Circulation; Blood Vessels; Cell Adhesion Molecules; cell behavior; Cell Communication; Cell Nucleus; cell type; Cell-Cell Adhesion; Cells; Cessation of life; Chromatin; Chromatin Structure; Complex; Computer Simulation; Cytoskeleton; design; Disease; Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm; Endothelial Cells; Endothelium; Environment; experience; experimental study; Extracellular Matrix; Extravasation; F-Actin; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profile; Goals; high resolution imaging; Image; In Vitro; in vivo; insight; Light; Malignant Neoplasms; Measurement; Measures; Mechanics; Metastatic to; Methods; Microcirculation; Microfluidics; migration; Modeling; monolayer; mortality; Nature; Neoplasm Circulating Cells; Neoplasm Metastasis; neoplastic cell; new therapeutic target; novel therapeutics; Nuclear; Organ; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phenotype; Population; Preclinical Drug Evaluation; Primary Neoplasm; Process; Proliferating; Proteins; public health relevance; receptor; Research; Resolution; Role; Signal Transduction; Site; small hairpin RNA; Stress; System; Therapeutic; Time; Tissues; Traction; transcriptome; transcriptome sequencing; tumor; Tumor Cell Invasion; Tumor-Associated Process; Vascular Endothelium; Work; ","Research Supplement - Quantitative analyses of tumor cell extravasation","202177","ZCA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","S1","03","126004","74342","200346",""

These plans should support the values of each individual for what matters most to support health and wellbeing. Unfortunately, individuals with multiple chronic conditions are often unaware of how their personal values could impact their treatment choices. We will build and test a personal health library for individuals with multiple chronic conditions that illuminates connections between personal values and chronic illness management.

The ZIKV outbreak in Brazil has been associated with a significant rise in the number of babies born with microcephaly and neurological disorders such as Guillain-Barré syndrome and has been declared a ?Global Emergency? by the World Health Organization. Zika virus is related to dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, and West Nile viruses, all of which are arthropod-borne flaviviruses.

This study seeks to inform the policy debate surrounding the expansion of APRNs? prescriptive authority in states that restrict their prescribing autonomy as one approach to addressing the significant psychiatrist-prescriber workforce shortage in the U.S.","6796244; ","KREYENBUHL, JULIE A.;","RUPP, AGNES ","09/05/2017","06/30/2020","Address; Adherence; alcohol use disorder; American Medical Association; Antidepressive Agents; Antipsychotic Agents; authority; base; behavioral health; Bipolar Disorder; Calendar; Caring; Certification; cohort; cost; Country; County; Crowding; Data; Data Set; Discipline of Nursing; Disease; District of Columbia; experience; Graduate Education; Guidelines; Health Care Visit; Individual; Legal; Licensure; Major Depressive Disorder; Maryland; Measures; Medicaid; Medical; medical specialties; Medicare; Modeling; Mood stabilizers; Natural experiment; Nurses; Outcome; patient safety; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Physicians; Policies; Primary Health Care; Process; Professional Organizations; Provider; Psychiatrist; Psychiatry; Psychopharmacology; Psychotherapy; Registered nurse; Registries; Regulation; Research; research study; Sample Size; Sampling; Schizophrenia; Selection Bias; severe mental illness; Site; Supervision; Time; Training; ","Addressing Psychiatrist Workforce Shortages in the U.S. with Psychiatric Advanced Practice Registered Nurses","113650","SERV","Mental Health Services Research Committee ","","","01","356683","187903","544586",""

This proposal will study the role of several viral and cellular genes and proteins in modulating EBV- and KSHV-mediated oncogenesis. To identify the mechanisms responsible for the oncogenic properties of these viruses, the projects will characterize the basic molecular properties of viral proteins and their interactions with cellular proteins.

Cycloadditions are powerful transformations that convert simple starting materials into useful molecular scaffolds that act as precursors for tool compounds that probe biological systems or as drug candidates for the treatment of disease. A dual function catalyst system is proposed that will catalyze the enantioselective cycloaddition between small-ring donor-acceptor compounds and dipolarophiles to produce building blocks for the synthesis of bioactive small molecules. The proposed catalyst will improve upon contemporary techniques by more effectively stabilizing the zwitterionic intermediate, thereby removing substrate limitations that hamper the utility of current methods.","12664968; ","TROTTA, ADAM ;","LEES, ROBERT G.","03/08/2017","","Acids; Acrylates; Alkenes; Amino Acids; Anions; Aziridines; base; Benzaldehyde; bioactive natural products; Biological; biological systems; Breathing; Carbazoles; Catalysis; catalyst; Cations; Charge; Chemicals; Chemistry; cycloaddition; Cyclobutanes; Cyclopentane; cyclopropane; Disease; drug candidate; enolate; Epoxy Compounds; experimental study; functional group; Furans; Goals; guanidinium; Hydrogen Bonding; Imines; Improve Access; improved; Indoles; Methods; Molecular; Naphthalene; nitrone; oxetane; Peptides; Periodicity; Phase; Pyrans; Pyrenes; Pyrroles; Reaction; scaffold; Scheme; small molecule; Solvents; Substrate Interaction; System; Techniques; Temperature; Terpenes; tetrahydrofuran; Thiourea; Time; tool; Transition Elements; Urea; Validation; Work; ","Dual Hydrogen-Bond Donor & Cation-?

Interpretation of modern high-throughput biological data is dependent upon innovation in computational biology and bioinformatics. If the US is to maintain leadership in science and technology its scientists should be demographically and geologically diverse. The Mid-South Computational Biology and Bioinformatics Society, MCBIOS, was founded in 2003 with the goal of bringing together researchers and students from throughout the region to promote research within a union of biology and computation. The annual conference fosters networking and collaboration as well as promotes professional development. From senior researchers to post-doctoral fellows and students, MCBIOS provides a peer-environment for presenting their research by poster, platform and/or publication. MCBIOS assumes responsibility for stimulating interest and improving education through opportunities in cutting edge research in computational biology and bioinformatics in the region, though we reach out beyond current boundaries.

Thus, novel therapies are urgently needed to treat this deadly disease. The goal of this project is to develop a new personalized approach to treat colorectal cancers. We discovered that colorectal cancers that have an abnormality (called a mutation) in a gene called PIK3CA require a particular nutrient, glutamine, to grow. We were able to cure mice with abnormal PIK3CA colorectal cancers, by giving a drug that interferes with glutamine. In this project we will perform a clinical trial that will be the first test of treating human colon cancer patients, whose tumors have PIK3CA mutations, with a new drug that blocks tumor's ability to use glutamine. In parallel we will do lab studies to better understand how this treatment works, and how to improve it further.","8644885; ","WANG, ZHENGHE ;","","","07/31/2022","addiction; alpha ketoglutarate; Aminooxyacetate; angiogenesis; Antineoplastic Agents; Apoptosis; Autophagocytosis; base; Basic Science; Biological Assay; Biological Markers; Biological Sciences; Biopsy; cancer cell; Cancer Etiology; Cancer Model; Cancer Science; capecitabine; Cells; Cessation of life; Citric Acid Cycle; Clinical; Clinical Trials; Collaborations; colon cancer patients; Colon Carcinoma; Colorectal Cancer; Communication; Data; Dependence; design; Development; Disease; DNA; Dose; Drug Combinations; enzyme pathway; Enzymes; fluoropyrimidine; Fluorouracil; Gene Expression; Genes; genome editing; Glutamates; Glutaminase; Glutamine; Goals; Growth; Human; improved; inhibitor/antagonist; innovation; knock-down; Knock-in Mouse; Knock-out; Malignant Neoplasms; Metabolism; metastatic colorectal; Modeling; Molecular; mouse model; Mus; mutant; Mutate; Mutation; Nature; novel; novel therapeutics; Nutrient; Oncogenes; Oncogenic; Oral; Pathway interactions; Patients; personalized approach; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacodynamics; Phase; Phase I Clinical Trials; Phase II Clinical Trials; PIK3CA gene; Precision therapeutics; Prodrugs; Production; Pyruvate; Reproduction spores; Resistance; RNA; small hairpin RNA; Structure; success; targeted treatment; Technology; Testing; Therapeutic Effect; Therapeutic Index; tissue culture; tool; Transaminases; tumor; tumor growth; tumor xenograft; United States; Up-Regulation; Uridine Phosphorylase; Work; Xenograft Model; Xenograft procedure; ","Project 4: Targeting Glutamine Metabolism in Colorectal Cancer Harboring PIK3CA Mutations","150964","ZCA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","8600","A1","06","188702","99833","","283687"

Many of these disorders, including autism, schizophrenia, dyslexia and ADHD are also associated with sensory integration deficits resulting from abnormal formation of these neural circuits.

INDIVIDUAL RESEARCH PROJECTS               PROJECT 1: Arsenic Uptake, Transport and Storage in Plants (Guerinot)          DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)          Rice (Oryza sativa), a staple food for over half the world's population, represents a significant dietary source of inorganic arsenic (As), a non-threshold, class 1 human carcinogen. It is imperative that strategies to reduce grain As are developed, and establishing the mechanisms that enable As to reach and accumulate within the rice grain is key to this endeavor. This project will elucidate the genetic control of As homeostasis in plants to enable the development of plants that do not accumulate As. The first specific aim tests the hypothesis that genetic diversity in rice can be exploited to lower grain As levels by mapping genes in accessions known to vary in grain As content. The second aim asks more generally what genes are involved in transferring As to the grain and the third aim tests strategies to limit the movement o As to the shoot/grain based on information gained from study of rice, Arabidopsis and the As accumulating fern Pteris vittata. The long-term goal is to prevent As accumulation in the edible portion of rice grain, but the work will also potentially provide information on genes responsible for transporting As and other contaminant metal(loid)s into the tissues of other edible plant organs. In addition to identifying the causal loci, synchrotron X-ray fluorescence microanalysis (SXRF) will be used to precisely localize and speciate As in plants, an innovative approach that has been used successfully to examine seed loading of As.          Public Health Relevance:  The investigators' efforts to select rice cultivars that restrict As accumulation in the grain offers one of the simplest and most cost effective approaches to solving the problem of As contamination of rice and rice-based products. These cultivars could immediately be used in As contaminated regions, as well as being suitable genetic stock for breeding programs to introduce low grain As into varieties suitable for commercial rice production.","1864759; ","STANTON, BRUCE A.;","CARLIN, DANIELLE J","04/01/1997","03/31/2019","Adverse effects; Agreement; Arabidopsis; Arsenic; Attention; Award; Bacterial Infections; Bangladesh; Barker Hypothesis; base; Binding; Bioinformatics; Biological; Breeding; Carbon; Carcinogens; Cardiovascular Diseases; career; Cereals; Child; Chromosome Mapping; Cognitive; Communities; Consensus; Consumption; contaminated seafood; cost effective; Country; Dangerousness; Development; developmental disease/disorder; Diabetes Mellitus; Diet; Disease; Dose; early life exposure; Ecosystem; Edible Plants; Environment; environmental change; environmental chemical; Environmental Health; epidemiology study; exposed human population; Exposure to; Ferns; fetal; Fetus; Fishes; Fluorescence; Food; Food Supply; Foundations; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Variation; Geographic state; Goals; Health; Health Policy; Homeostasis; Human; in utero; Individual; Infant; Inflammation; Innate Immune Response; innovation; Interdisciplinary Study; Juice; Knowledge; Language; Lead; Leadership; Legal; Liquid substance; Lung; Lung diseases; Malignant Neoplasms; Marines; Measures; Memory; Mercury; Metabolic syndrome; Metals; Methylmercury Compounds; Modeling; Mothers; Motor; Movement; Nervous system structure; Newborn Infant; offspring; Organ; Oryza sativa; plant growth/development; Plants; Play; Population; pregnant; Pregnant Women; prevent; Privatization; Problem Solving; Production; programs; Psyche structure; Pteris; Public Health; public health relevance; Publications; Publishing; reproductive; Research; Research Personnel; Research Project Grants; Rice; Risk; Risk Assessment; Roentgen Rays; Role; Safety; Saline; Science; Seeds; Shellfish; Signal Recognition Particle; skills; Source; Superfund; superfund site; Synchrotrons; Techniques; Temperature; Testing; Thinking; Tissues; Toddler; Toxin; Trace Elements; Training; Training Programs; Translational Research; uptake; Visuospatial; Water; Work; ","Sources and Protracted Effects of Early Life Exposure to Arsenic and Mercury","007373","ZES1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","S1","22","10000","","10000",""

The central aim is to understand viral DNA packaging, a process where currently major mechanistic problems remain unsolved. We have proposed a novel torsional compression translocation model for the linear packaging motor using bacteriophage T4 as a model system. B-form DNA compression is important for the packaging motor, and the proposed experiments will demonstrate that the packaging motor transiently compresses B-form to A-form DNA. Our recent evidence supports a double protein ring-double DNA synapsis model for control of packaging initiation that may apply to all the pac site phages and explain the variety of ring structures found among them. Comparable motor proteins act among phages, herpes- and adenoviruses, although only the phage motors can thus far be studied in vitro. Our studies will provide a better understanding of the packaging motor mechanism, thus are relevant to the broad mission of the NIH as our findings may be of medical importance in developing antivirals and other interventions that protect human health.","1970190; ","BLACK, LINDSAY W;","SAKALIAN, MICHAEL ","06/01/2016","05/31/2020","A-Form DNA; Adenoviruses; Antiviral Agents; ATP Hydrolysis; ATPase Domain; B-DNA; Bacteriophage T4; Bacteriophages; base; Binding; Biological Models; Bromides; C-terminal; Chimeric Proteins; Chromosome Pairing; Clip; cold temperature; Complex; Concatenated DNA; crosslink; Cruciform DNA; Crystallography; Data; DNA; DNA Packaging; DNA Structure; Docking; Double-Stranded RNA; ds-DNA; Dyes; Ethidium; Excision; experimental study; Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer; Fluorescent Dyes; Genetic; Goals; Grant; grasp; Health; Human; In Vitro; in vivo; Influenza; insight; Intervention; Kinetics; Laboratories; Length; Linear Models; Mass Spectrum Analysis; Measurement; Medical; Microscopy; Mission; Modeling; Motor; mutant; Mutation; N-terminal; novel; nuclease; Optics; Peptides; Positioning Attribute; Preparation; Process; Proteins; public health relevance; Resistance; Resolution; RNA; Role; Signal Transduction; Site; Solid; stem; Structure; terminase; Torsion; Twin Multiple Birth; United States National Institutes of Health; viral DNA; Virus Assembly; Work; ","Mechanism of bacteriophage DNA packaging initiation and DNA translocation.","118766","PCMB","Prokaryotic Cell and Molecular Biology Study Section ","","","02","197500","107555","305055",""

Understanding how very low nicotine content cigarettes may affect smoking behavior in adolescents, both in the laboratory and in the natural environment, will illuminate the potential positive and negative consequences of these products.

In the United States, 6.6 million adults and 0.66 million children have significant vision loss (American Community Survey, 2012). Visual impairments (blindness and low vision) severely and negatively impact the quality of life. Major blinding diseases include age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma and retinitis pigmentosa. The long-term impact of blindness and visual impairments on the brain structures and functions associated with visual processing is not known. This knowledge gap has impeded our ability to predict which patients may benefit from sight restorative therapies and then their outcomes after a prolonged period of blindness, which in turn limits our ability to develop new treatments. The proposed research will fill this knowledge gap by amassing retinal imaging and vision assessment data, then correlating each local region of the disease-affected visual field with the retinotopically associated brain anatomic structures and functions, inferred from detailed neuroimaging data collected from the same patients using protocols specified in the Human Connectome Project. The resulting database and the newly developed data- analysis tools will transform our understanding of neural plasticity associated with vision loss and sight restoration.","1869099; 14619001; 10234518 (contact); ","AGUIRRE, GEOFFREY KARL; PATEL, VIVEK R.; SHI, YONGGANG  (contact);","WIGGS, CHERI ","09/01/2015","08/31/2019","Adult; Affect; Aftercare; Age related macular degeneration; American; analytical method; Anatomy; Area; base; blind; Blindness; Brain; Brain Mapping; Child; Clinical Data; Clinical Trials; Communities; Community Surveys; Complete Blindness; computer code; connectome; Data; Data Analyses; Data Set; Databases; Diabetic Retinopathy; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Discrimination; Disease; extrastriate visual cortex; Eye diseases; Fiber; follow-up; Foundations; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Gene therapy trial; Generations; Glaucoma; Human; Image; innovation; Knowledge; Leber's amaurosis; Lesion; Maps; Measures; Modality; Modeling; Morphology; neuroimaging; Neuronal Plasticity; Neurophysiology - biologic function; novel; Ophthalmology; Optic Nerve; optical imaging; Optics; Outcome; Participant; Pathology; Patients; Photic Stimulation; Play; Process; Protocols documentation; Psychophysics; public health relevance; Quality of life; Radiation; Recruitment Activity; relating to nervous system; repaired; Research; Resolution; response; Rest; restoration; Retina; Retinal; retinal damage; Retinal Detachment; Retinal Diseases; retinal prosthesis; Retinitis Pigmentosa; retinotopic; Role; Specific qualifier value; Statistical Models; Stem cells; Structure; Tactile; Techniques; Testing; Therapeutic Intervention; Thick; Time; Tissues; tool; Treatment outcome; United States; Variant; Vision; Visit; Visual; Visual Fields; Visual impairment; Visual Pathways; visual processing; Visually Impaired Persons; white matter; ","Human Connectomes for Low Vision, Blindness, and Sight Restoration","025864","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","03","685893","335270","1021163",""

Despite many years of research, no effective therapies for HD have been developed to prevent disease progression. To date, most research efforts and funding resources have been directed to the identification of mechanisms linking neuronal cell death in HD. However, cumulative pathological, electrophysiological, and behavioral evidence revealed deficits in neuronal connectivity that occurs much earlier in the course of disease. Providing a cellular basis for these deficits, our recent studies using YFP-R6/2 reporter mice provided direct evidence that neurons affected in HD follow a dying back pattern of degeneration. A major implication of these findings is that any effective therapeutic strategies to treat HD should aim to prevent or halt the progressive loss of axonal connectivity that takes place very early in the disease process. However, the axonal compartment has received little attention in the context of HD. Consequently, our knowledge of molecular mechanisms underlying axonal and neuritic pathology in HD remains meager. It is well established that mutant huntingtin (mhtt) promotes deficits in axonal transport, a cellular process critical for the appropriate maintenance of axons. Further, studies by our group revealed that this toxic effect of mhtt is mediated by the protein kinase JNK3, which was also found to phosphorylate the major motor protein kinesin-1. The relevance of these findings to HD is highlighted by preliminary in vivo studies in this proposal documenting a remarkable beneficial effect of genetic JNK3 deletion on R6/2 mice neuropathology and survival. Based on these precedents, studies proposed in this application will directly evaluate the contribution of JNK3 to axonal degeneration in vivo, and identify JNK3-dependent alterations in the phosphorylation of axonal proteins associated with mhtt expression. Overall, findings from these studies will help establish whether inhibition of JNK3 helps preserve neuronal connectivity in HD, and provide a molecular basis linking JNK3 activation to mtt-induced neuritic pathology.","8274659; ","MORFINI, GERARDO ANDRES;","MILLER, DANIEL L","09/15/2016","08/31/2018","Address; Affect; American; Atrophic; Attention; Axon; axonal degeneration; Axonal Transport; axonopathy; Back; Basal Ganglia; base; Behavioral; behavioral impairment; Biochemical; Cell Death; Cell physiology; Characteristics; Clinical; Critiques; Cytoskeleton; Data; Dependence; Disease; Disease model; Disease Progression; Distant; Dynein ATPase; effective therapy; Electrophysiology (science); Event; experimental study; Fluorescence; Functional disorder; Funding; Genetic; Huntington Disease; Huntington gene; Impaired cognition; in vivo; Inherited; Kinesin; Knowledge; Label; Length; Link; Maintenance; MAPK10 gene; MAPK8 gene; Mediating; Microscopic; Microtubules; Mind; Molecular; Molecular Profiling; Motor; motor deficit; motor symptom; mouse model; Mus; mutant; Mutation; Neurodegenerative Disorders; neuron loss; neuronal cell body; Neurons; neuropathology; neurotoxicity; novel; Pathogenicity; Pathologic; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Pattern; Phosphorylation; Phosphotransferases; polyglutamine; Population Projection; prevent; Process; protein activation; Protein Isoforms; Protein Kinase; Proteins; Publishing; Regulation; Reporter; Research; Resources; Risk; Role; Signal Transduction; Solid; Symptoms; Synapses; Therapeutic; therapeutic development; therapeutic target; Toxic effect; Tracer; Treatment Efficacy; ","Addressing the contribution of JNK3 to axonal pathology in Huntington's disease","096642","CMND","Cellular and Molecular Biology of Neurodegeneration Study Section ","","","02","125000","74875","199875",""

The CTSPHL is currently in Year 5 of the Attainment of ISO/IEC 17025:2005 Accreditation for Testing Foods for Microbiology grant initially awarded in September 2012. The CTSPHL applied for ISO/IEC 17025:2005 (ISO) accreditation in January of 2017 and was audited by the Laboratory?s chosen accrediting body, AIHA-LAP, LLC, in March of 2017. The CTSPHL has corrected the deficiencies found in the audit and made its initial response to the audit findings. Accreditation is expected to be achieved before the current grant expires (08/31/2017). Maintaining ISO/IEC 17025:2005 Accreditation: The Laboratory will maintain its accreditation for food testing. Based on the results of the initial audit, the Laboratory feels the findings were of a minor nature, and that the corrective actions put in place will satisfy the ISO requirements. In order to maintain accreditation for year 1, the CTSPHL will participate in the AOAC PT Sample Program, as it has for the last 4 years, and follow the ISO requirements for internal inspections and training. Increasing the Number of Food Samples Analyzed Annually: The Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection (DCP) is the State agency that is enrolled in the MFRPS. The DCP and the CTSPHL will work collaboratively to collect and analyze food samples over the grant period The collaborative effort will be to collect and analyze 8-10 samples per month for routine surveillance. In the event of a food emergency this number may increase depending on the circumstances. Currently the number of samples collected and analyzed is 4/month, therefore this will effectively double the number of samples analyzed. Enhancement of Scope of Testing: The CTSPHL currently performs presence/absence testing for three organisms in produce: Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, and Escherichia coli O157:H7. The CTSPHL proposes adding presence/absence testing for shiga toxin producing e. coli (STEC) to broaden its scope of testing. The CTSPHL would develop and validate the procedure in the initial year of the grant and implement routine surveillance in year 2. The Environmental Microbiology Laboratory will follow the Food and Drug Administration Bacteriological Analytical Manual (FDA BAM) methodology for the detection and recovery of non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC). The enrichment procedure and real-time PCR screening assay validated for E.coli O157 in FDA BAM is also validated for other non-O157 STEC. The FDA BAM isolation and confirmation procedures for non-O157 STEC will be followed including adding additional media, L-EMB agar for isolation and performing Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) on isolates to confirm toxigenic potential. Further characterization of positive non-O157 STEC isolates will be performed using whole genome sequencing.","14960727; ","RAZEQ, JAFAR ;","","09/05/2017","06/30/2019","","Maintenance and Enhancement of ISO/IEC 17025 Accreditation and Whole Genome Sequencing for State Food Testing Laboratories","006199","ZFD1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","","","145000",""

Our central hypothesis is that there are specific risk factors that can be modified to prevent Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms and recurrent urinary tract infections. We will determine risk and protective factors by using epidemiological and electronic health record databases and will conduct qualitative studies that lead to survey development in women across the lifespan. Ultimately, we will assist in the design and development of longitudinal population-based study on risk factors for these conditions that will lead to preventive interventions in selected female populations.","9316651; ","NEWMAN, DIANE K.;","KIRKALI, ZIYA ","08/25/2015","06/30/2020","Address; Affect; Age; age group; Area; Attitude; base; Behavior; Behavioral; Bioinformatics; Bladder; Clinical; Clinical Data; Clinical Trials; Cohort Studies; Collaborations; Comorbidity; cost; Data; Databases; design; Development; Diet Modification; Distress; effective intervention; Elderly; Electronic Health Record; Epidemiology; epidemiology study; Evaluation; experience; Female; Female Adolescents; Goals; Habits; Health; Health Care Costs; Health Services Research; help-seeking behavior; improved; Incidence; Individual; instrument; Interstitial Cystitis; Intervention; Lead; Life; Lifetime Risk; Liquid substance; Longevity; Longitudinal Studies; Low Prevalence; lower urinary tract symptoms; Medicine; member; Meta-Analysis; Methodology; middle age; Modeling; modifiable risk; Multicenter Trials; Observational Study; older women; Overactive Bladder; Pattern; Pennsylvania; Perception; Phase; Population; Population Study; Predictive Factor; Prevalence; prevent; Prevention; Prevention Research; Preventive Intervention; public health relevance; Publishing; Qualitative Research; Quality of life; racial and ethnic; Randomized Controlled Trials; Recurrence; Reporting; reproductive; Research; Research Methodology; response; Risk; Risk Factors; Site; Surveys; symptom management; Symptoms; systematic review; Team Nursing; Testing; Training; Universities; Urinary Incontinence; Urinary tract infection; Urination; Urology; Woman; young adult; young woman; ","University of Pennsylvania+ PLUS Clinical Center (PENN+PLUS CC)","106892","ZDK1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","S1","03","100000","60000","160000",""

The second is to coach families to embed evidence-based intervention strategies for toddlers with ASD in everyday activities using the Early Social Interaction (ESI) model. In Phase 1, we will compare the effectiveness of adaptive interventions that use MI+PSE with and without ESI on parent and child outcomes in 3 sites in Florida and Massachusetts. In Phase 2, we will construct an adaptive intervention to optimize the effects and study the feasibility of implementation in new sites in California.

Here, we propose the use of experimental models of lung cancer in combination with inhibitors of intracellular signaling pathways to explore the importance of certain key signaling pathways in lung cancer initiation, progression and therapy. The overarching, long-term goal of these experiments is the development of new, evidence-based, rationally-designed strategies to more effectively treat all lung cancer patients.","6483196; ","MCMAHON, MARTIN ;","OGUNBIYI, PETER ","12/01/2007","08/31/2020","1-Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase; Acyltransferase; Address; Alleles; antitumor effect; Apoptosis; base; Behavior; Benign; beta catenin; Biochemistry; Biological Models; c-myc Genes; cancer clinical trial; cancer genetics; cancer initiation; Cancer Patient; cancer therapy; cDNA Expression; Cell Cycle; Cell Line; Cellular biology; Cessation of life; chemotherapy; Clinical; clinically relevant; CRISPR/Cas technology; Databases; Dependency; design; Development; Disease; Disease Resistance; Dissociation; DNA Sequence Alteration; Drug resistance; Evaluation; Event; evidence base; Experimental Models; experimental study; Extracellular Signal Regulated Kinases; Foundations; Future; Gene Silencing; Genes; Genetic; Genetic study; Genetically Engineered Mouse; Genome; Genomics; Goals; Grant; Growth; Human; In Vitro; in vivo; in vivo Model; inhibitor/antagonist; innovation; Integrins; Investigation; Lesion; Ligands; Lipids; Lung; Lung Adenocarcinoma; lung carcinogenesis; Lung Neoplasms; lung tumorigenesis; Maintenance; Malignant - descriptor; Malignant neoplasm of lung; Mediating; MEKs; Minority; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Molecular; Molecular Abnormality; Molecular Mechanisms of Action; mouse model; Mus; Mutagenesis; Mutation; neoplastic cell; Normal Cell; novel; Oncogene Activation; Oncogenes; Oncogenic; Operative Surgical Procedures; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Patients; PDPK1 gene; Pharmacology; Phase; Physicians; PI3 gene; Play; Porcupines; predictive marker; Prognostic Marker; Protein Array Analysis; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; PTEN gene; public health relevance; Publishing; Radiation; Regulation; Research; Resources; response; Risk stratification; Role; Scientist; Scourge; senescence; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Sleeping Beauty; Solid; Specimen; statistics; Subfamily lentivirinae; System; Talents; targeted treatment; Testing; The Cancer Genome Atlas; Therapeutic; tool; transcriptome sequencing; translational cancer research; tumor; tumor progression; Tumor Suppressor Genes; Ursidae Family; Validation; WNT Signaling Pathway; X-Ray Computed Tomography; ","Identifying the molecular mechanisms of the regulation of integrin B3 expression by the MAP Kinase pathway","131261","TCB","Tumor Cell Biology Study Section ","","S1","08","33960","16534","50494",""

Unfit or uncooperative cells can arise by mutation in somatic tissues, potentially causing disease. Mechanisms to detect such mutant cells exist and elicit cell-cell interactions that prevent them from contributing to the animal. Although this process helps promote animal health, exploitation of the process could promote expansion of dangerous cells, as in cancer. Here we investigate the function of a secreted protein that mediates the recognition and elimination of unfit or dangerous cells. Understanding the process by which cells recognize aberrant cells could present therapeutic and preventative opportunities for diseases that exploit these detection mechanisms.","1884563; ","JOHNSTON, LAURA A;","MELILLO, AMANDA A","08/01/2006","06/30/2019","Address; Adult; Animals; base; Biochemical; Biological Assay; Cell Communication; Cells; Cessation of life; Code; Communication; Competitive Behavior; Conditioned Culture Media; cytokine; Dangerousness; Data; Detection; Development; Diffuse; Disease; Drosophila genus; Embryo; Ensure; Enzymes; Epigenetic Process; Event; experimental study; Family member; fitness; Genetic; genome editing; Growth; Health; Hemolymph; Immune; In Situ; Individual; Larva; Lead; Ligands; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; Molecular; Molecular Profiling; Mosaicism; mutant; Mutation; Natural Immunity; Normal tissue morphology; novel; Pathway interactions; Pattern; Peptide Hydrolases; Population; prevent; Process; Property; Protein Family; Protein Isoforms; Proteins; Proteomics; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc; public health relevance; Ribosomal Proteins; RNA Splicing; Role; sensor; Serine Protease; Serpins; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Site; Somatic Mutation; Stress; System; Testing; Therapeutic; Tissues; Wing; Work; ","Mechanisms of cell competition that regulate growth during development","078464","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","S1","11","63520","","63520",""

Because over half of all research projects at TNPRC are initiated by Affiliate (outside) investigators, this resource is also essential to the success of many NIH-funded investigators throughout the country. Several years ago the TNPRC established the goal of converting its rhesus monkey breeding colony to specific pathogen free (SPF) status. A major step toward that goal was the award of this U42 grant in 2001 to provide funds to establish an SPF Indian-origin rhesus monkey colony at the TNPRC to provide monkeys for NIH-funded AIDS research.

Veterans with a history of severe TBI have difficulties thinking and remembering and are at an increased risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) later in life. In a unique experimental animal model, we will see if delayed, long-term, non-invasive rehabilitative therapy using environmental enrichment (EE), alone or combined with simvastatin, a cholesterol lowering drug which helps the injured brain, will improve recovery and reduce brain levels of toxic proteins that accumulate after TBI. We will also examine a novel, gene- regulating mechanism underlying the effects of EE/simvastatin therapy. These studies will provide critical data to guide future clinical trials using EE and simvastatin to enhance rehabilitation after TBI and reduce risk of developing AD.

Diagnosis, treatment, high recurrence, hospitalizations, surgery, and lost work time due to these stones cost billions of dollars yearly in the United States. Stone formation is also associated with increased rates of chronic kidney disease and hypertension which are not completely explained by obesity, a risk factor in each of these conditions. Additionally, by 70 years of age, 11% of men and 5.6% of women will develop a stone. The majority (80%) of these calcium stones is found to be calcium oxalate (CaOx), with variable amounts of calcium phosphate (CaP). Research conducted over the past 3-4 decades focused only on delineating the mechanism of CaOx stone formation. However, over the past two decades, there is a documented increase in the prevalence of pure CaP stones in the kidney, suggesting the need for research about the formation of CaP stones to develop new clinical interventions and therapy. The proposed research will thus provide the evidence for the molecular candidates that governs the regulation of calcium concentration inside the proximal tubular lumen to focus on the mechanism of formation of these CaP stones, as well as the potential in vivo interventions in our animal model. Additionally, the proposed study will shed light on the aggregation of CaP crystals (amorphous) found in Randall's plaque, which is created from large spherulites of CaOx that grows over this CaP nidus. Therefore information gained from the proposed study can potentially lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for both CaP and CaOx stone formation.","9379533; ","BANDYOPADHYAY, BIDHAN CHANDRA;","KETCHUM, CHRISTIAN J.","09/02/2015","08/31/2020","Acetazolamide; Active Biological Transport; adeno-associated viral vector; Age-Years; alkalinity; Alkalinization; Amino Acids; Animal Model; Apical; Attenuated; base; Betaine; Breast Microcalcification; calcification; Calcified; Calcium; Calcium Gluconate; Calcium Oxalate; calcium phosphate; calcium phosphate precipitation; Calcium-Sensing Receptors; Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors; Cells; Chronic Kidney Failure; Clinical; Complementary DNA; cost; Couples; Coupling; Crystallization; Data; Development; Diagnosis; Electrolytes; Electrophysiology (science); Epidemiology; Excretory function; experimental study; extracellular; G-Protein-Coupled Receptors; Gene Delivery; Genetic; GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs; Henle's loop; Hormones; Hospitalization; Hypercalcemia; Hypertension; Image; in vivo; Infusion procedures; inorganic phosphate; Intervention; ITPR1 gene; Kidney; Kidney Calculi; Knockout Mice; Lead; Light; Limb structure; Link; Liquid substance; Lithium; lost work time; luminal membrane; Luminal region; Maintenance; Measures; Mediating; men; Microfluidic Microchips; Molecular; mouse model; Mus; Nephrolithiasis; Nephrons; novel; novel therapeutic intervention; Obesity; Operative Surgical Procedures; Oral; overexpression; Oxalates; Patch-Clamp Techniques; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Patients; Permeability; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacology; Phenotype; Phospholipase C; Phospholipases A; potassium citrate; Prevalence; prevent; Process; Property; Protons; Proximal Kidney Tubules; public health relevance; receptor; Recurrence; Regulation; Reporting; Research; Resolution; response; Risk Factors; Role; Route; Signal Transduction; Signaling Protein; Site; Small Interfering RNA; targeted delivery; Testing; Therapeutic Intervention; Thinness; Time; time interval; Tubular formation; United States; urinary; Urine; Woman; ","Calcium transport in kidney proximal tubule and calcium phosphate stone formation","102043","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","03","150000","37650","187650",""

Project Narrative The research described in this application is relevant to public health in the United States because the consumption of alcohol-containing beverages increases the risk for both accidents resulting in skeletal injury and serious clinical complications associated with these injuries, including fracture nonunion, which greatly increases patient morbidity and mortality following a fracture injury. The fact that these alcohol-associated injuries are most likely to occur in our adolescent and young adult populations increases the need for research in the area of alcohol consumption and orthopaedic injury to allow these persons to resume a productive life as citizens of our country. An understanding of the reasons why bone fracture injuries are less likely to heal normally in alcohol-intoxicated patients may allow us to use different treatment strategies for this subset of injured persons to increase the odds that they may recover fully from their injuries.","6270556; ","CALLACI, JOHN J.;","OROSZ, ANDRAS ","09/05/2017","08/31/2019","Accidents; Admission activity; Adolescent and Young Adult; Affect; Aging; Alcohol abuse; Alcohol consumption; alcohol effect; alcohol exposure; Alcohols; Animals; Antioxidants; Area; Attenuated; base; Beverages; binge drinking; bone; Bone callus; Bone necrosis; Bone Transplantation; cartilaginous; Cell Differentiation process; Cell Lineage; cellular targeting; Chondrocytes; Clinical; Complication; Country; Data; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; Disease; drinking behavior; Early Promoters; experimental study; fetal; FOXO1A gene; Fracture; Fracture Healing; Free Radicals; Goals; healing; Heavy Drinking; Hospitals; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; injured; Injury; Inpatients; Investigation; Laboratories; LacZ Genes; Life; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Minerals; Molecular; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; negative affect; novel; Operative Surgical Procedures; Organ; Orthopedics; Osteoblasts; Osteogenesis; osteogenic; outcome forecast; Oxidative Stress; Patients; Pattern; Persons; Phosphorylation; Population; Preparation; problem drinker; Process; Public Health; Rattus; Reactive Oxygen Species; regenerative; repaired; Reporter; Research; Risk; Rodent; self-renewal; Serine; Signal Transduction; Site; skeletal injury; Skeleton; stem cell differentiation; stem cell technology; Stem cells; Therapeutic; Time; Tissues; Transgenic Organisms; Trauma patient; Traumatic injury; treatment strategy; United States; WNT Signaling Pathway; ","Alcohol-Induced Oxidative Stress and MSC Differentiation During Fracture Repair","025551","ZAA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","01","143750","73313","217063",""

TBM presents with dynamic airway collapse and respiratory difficulties. In severe cases, TBM results in acute life-threatening events and even death. We have developed a bioresorbable splint for TBM that can be custom designed for patient specific anatomy and custom designed to have specific mechanical properties. The splint is fabricated using a 3D printing process which we have developed for bioresorbable PCL. We are currently going forward with plans to perform a clinical trial on the splint. As part of this, we and the FDA saw a need for more preclinical data on long term splint degradation and how this degradation affects splint and airway mechanics. We will evaluate degradation both in vitro and in a large in vivo preclinical model, the Yorkshire Pig. We will further perform finite element modeling of malacic airways with the splint to determine how degradation affects mechanical stimulation of the airway.","1877750; ","HOLLISTER, SCOTT J;","TAMBURRO, ROBERT F.","08/19/2016","07/31/2021","","Degradation and Fatigue Behavior of 3D Printed Bioresorbable Tracheal Splints","086201","BTSS","Bioengineering, Technology and Surgical Sciences Study Section ","","","02","264744","94637","359381",""

It is our firm belief that the results of these studies will provide information tha not only should allow us to better understand the pathobiology of immune/organ injury seen in response traumatic shock and/or sepsis, but also its attenuation.","1860711; ","AYALA, ALFRED ;","DUNSMORE, SARAH ","05/01/2016","04/30/2021","Acute Lung Injury; Adoptive Transfer; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Antibiotics; Apoptosis; Area; attenuation; Automobile Driving; base; Belief; Caring; CD8B1 gene; Cell surface; Cells; Clinical; Clinical Research; comparative; Complex; Critical Illness; Data; design; Development; Diagnosis; Endothelial Cells; Epithelial Cells; Event; Experimental Models; Family; Functional disorder; Gene Proteins; Genetic; Hemorrhagic Shock; Immune; Immune system; Immune System and Related Disorders; Immune System Diseases; Immunologic Memory; improved; Individual; inhibitor/antagonist; injured; Injury; Intervention; Intestines; Leukocytes; Ligands; Liver; Lymphoid; Lymphoid Cell; macrophage; Mediating; member; Mind; Modeling; Molecular; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; mouse model; Multiple Organ Failure; Mus; Myelogenous; Myeloid Cells; Natural immunosuppression; neonatal sepsis; neonate; neutrophil; novel; Organ; Outcome; Patient observation; patient population; Patients; Phagocytes; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Play; Predisposition; Process; protein expression; Proteins; public health relevance; receptor; response; Role; Sepsis; septic; Septic Shock; Series; Shock; Supportive care; Surgical Intensive Care; Syndrome; T-Lymphocyte; Therapeutic Agents; Tissues; Traumatic Shock; ","Mechanisms of Immune Dysfunction and Morbid Outcome in Response to Shock/Sepsis","118097","ZGM1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","S1","02","47875","","47875",""

Catheter associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are important contributors to such infections, with estimates ranging from 40-60%. Women, those with strokes, the disabled and the elderly are particularly susceptible to CAUTIs. Polymer Exploration Group, PEG LLC is developing a new approach to greatly reduce the incidence of CAUTIs. The new PEG LLC approach does not use antibiotics or antimicrobials that lead to ?super-bugs?. PEG LLC also avoids heavy metals like silver. In summary, PEG LLC is aiming to eliminate infections with comfort and safety for patients. Results thus far show exciting promise for bringing much needed innovation to catheter technology.","14804640 (contact); 1864212; 7927232; ","BRUNSON, KENNARD M (contact); OHMAN, DENNIS EDWARD; WEN, XUEJUN ;","GOSSETT, DANIEL ROBERT","03/06/2017","08/31/2018","Adhesions; Adsorption; Agar; Aliquot; Animal Model; Antibiotics; antimicrobial; antimicrobial drug; Award; Bacteria; bacterial resistance; base; Biocompatible Materials; biomaterial compatibility; Candida albicans; catheter associated UTI; Catheters; Cells; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.); Characteristics; Charge; Chemicals; Chemistry; Colony-forming units; Coupled; density; design; Disabled Persons; Dyes; Economics; Effectiveness; Elderly; Engineering; Enterobacter; Enterococcus; Environment; Equilibrium; Escherichia coli; Evaluation; Exposure to; flasks; Goals; Healthcare; Heavy Metals; Histocompatibility; Human; Immersion Investigative Technique; Immunology; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; Incidence; Infection; innovation; Killings; Klebsiella pneumonia bacterium; Laboratories; Lead; Length; Measures; Mechanics; Medical Care Costs; medical complication; medical schools; Methods; Microbiology; Modeling; Modification; Monitor; Nitrogen; novel strategies; Oryctolagus cuniculus; pathogen; patient safety; Patient-Focused Outcomes; Phase; Polymers; Preparation; Process; professor; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Research; Resistance; Running; Silicones; Silver; Small Business Innovation Research Grant; ST14 gene; stroke; Surface; Suspensions; Technology; Testing; Time; United States National Institutes of Health; Urine; Validation; Woman; Work; zeta potential; ","Antimicrobial catheters with cell and tissue compatibility","103398","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","04","","","820970",""

Moreover, in both humans and mice, we test the ability to increase colon 15- PGDH (and thus increase sensitivity to aspirin like drugs) by anti-cancer strategies that reduce inflammatory tone, including: weight loss, exercise, and avoidance of red meat.","1888502; ","MARKOWITZ, SANFORD D.;","","","07/31/2022","Advisory Committees; Americas; Archives; Aspirin; base; Behavioral; Biological; Biological Assay; Biological Markers; Body Weight decreased; Cancer Etiology; Cancer Prevention Study II; cancer risk; cardiovascular risk factor; Cessation of life; Chemoprevention; Clinical; clinical investigation; Clinical Research; Colon; Colon Carcinoma; Colonic Adenoma; Colonic Neoplasms; Colonoscopy; Colorectal Adenoma; Colorectal Cancer; colorectal cancer prevention; colorectal cancer screening; cyclooxygenase 1; Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors; Development; Diet; Dinoprostone; Enzymes; Exercise; Follow-Up Studies; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profile; gene panel; General Population; Genes; genetic signature; Genetic study; Goals; Growth and Development function; Health Professional; high risk; Human; improved; in vivo; Incidence; Individual; Individual Differences; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Injury; Journals; Leadership; Life Style; lifestyle factors; lifestyle intervention; Link; Lipids; Malignant Neoplasms; Meat; Mediating; Metabolic; Metabolic Pathway; mouse model; mouse PGE synthase 1; Mucous Membrane; Mus; Nurses' Health Study; Obesity; Oncogenic; Organ; Pathway interactions; personalized strategies; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Physical activity; Play; Population; predictive marker; prevent; Prevention; Preventive service; Primary Prevention; PTGS2 gene; Publishing; red meat consumption; Regulator Genes; Reproduction spores; Resistance; response; Risk; Risk Factors; Sampling; Science; screening; Seminal; Stem cells; Surrogate Markers; Testing; Tissues; translational medicine; Translational Research; Tumor Suppressor Genes; Uncertainty; United States; Validation; Work; ","Project 1: Targeting 15-PGDH in Colon Cancer Risk, Prevention and Treatment","150964","ZCA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","8597","A1","06","265442","159265","","417886"

The applicants have recently discovered a novel class of anticancer agents that exerts anti-breast cancer activity by simultaneously targeting two cancer- causing genes, MDM2 and NFAT1. This anticancer strategy has not been reported before. This project will develop a lead compound, called JapA, for the treatment of advanced breast cancer. The applicants will test the lead compound for its efficacy and safety in clinically-relevant breast cancer models, and will determine how the compound kills cancer cells. If successful, the expected results will have a major impact on the health care of breast cancer patients and on public health by bringing a new class of anti-breast cancer agents to clinical testing.","1984443; ","ZHANG, RUIWEN ;","FU, YALI ","09/04/2017","08/31/2022","advanced disease; Affinity; anticancer activity; Antineoplastic Agents; base; Basic Research Breast Cancer; Binding; Breast Cancer Model; Breast Cancer Patient; Breast Cancer therapy; Calcineurin; Cancer Biology; cancer cell; Cancer Etiology; Cancer Prognosis; cancer therapy; Cessation of life; chemotherapeutic agent; chemotherapy; Clinical; clinical candidate; clinical development; clinically relevant; cytotoxicity; Data; design; Development; drug candidate; drug discovery; Drug Kinetics; Early Diagnosis; Early treatment; effective therapy; Functional disorder; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Transcription; Healthcare; high throughput screening; improved; In Vitro; in vitro activity; in vivo; in vivo Model; inhibitor/antagonist; Killings; Knowledge; Laboratories; Lead; Libraries; malignant breast neoplasm; Malignant Neoplasms; MDM2 gene; Mediating; Modeling; Molecular; Molecular Target; mutant; Natural Products; Nature; Neoplasm Metastasis; novel; novel strategies; nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic 2 protein; Oncogenes; Oncogenic; outcome forecast; overexpression; Pathway interactions; Patient Care; Patients; Pharmacology and Toxicology; Phenotype; Play; preclinical development; Primary Neoplasm; Principal Investigator; programs; promoter; Property; protein degradation; Public Health; Quality of life; Radiation therapy; Radioresistance; Reporting; research clinical testing; response; Role; Safety; Series; Signal Pathway; small molecule inhibitor; targeted agent; targeted cancer therapy; targeted treatment; Technology; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Agents; therapy outcome; Tissues; Toxic effect; TP53 gene; Treatment Efficacy; treatment response; treatment strategy; triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma; Tumor stage; Tumor Suppressor Genes; Tumor-Derived; Woman; ","Novel NFAT1-MDM2 inhibitor for Breast Cancer Therapy","214019","DMP","Drug Discovery and Molecular Pharmacology Study Section ","","A1","01","407125","185042","592167",""

And yet: HIV incidence and mortality rates remain unacceptably high in this HIV-endemic setting. To inform future implementation of ART programs, including under treatment-as-prevention scenarios, further evidence is needed in two areas: first, the mechanisms through which ART scale-up reduces HIV incidence - the 'pathways to prevention' - and in particular, the role of behavioral vs. biological pathways in determining community level incidence rates; and second, the reasons why people are still dying from HIV in the era of free and widely available ART. Information in these areas will inform wrap-around behavioral prevention interventions to augment treatment as prevention strategies and will shape efforts to improve outcomes across the cascade of HIV care and treatment. Evidence in these two areas will be critical to reducing the large lingering burden of HIV disease in South Africa. To establish this critical evidence base, we will analyze longitudinal health and demographic surveillance data collected by the Africa Centre for a complete population cohort in rural KwaZulu-Natal. These data include population-based HIV biomarker collection, data on sexual behaviors and ART knowledge and attitudes, and verbal autopsies to determine causes of all deaths in the population. Further, clinical records from the national ART program have been linked into the surveillance by national ID, enabling us to observe individuals as they progress through the complete cascade of HIV care, from HIV infection to recovery on ART, or death. Through epidemiological analysis, we will: determine the pathways through which high ART coverage reduces HIV incidence at the population level; and establish the determinants of HIV mortality in age of widespread ART availability. The study team is led by South Africa PI Frank Tanser, University of KwaZulu- Natal, and US PI Till Barnighausen, Harvard School of Public Health, and will support several mentored post- doctoral opportunities at the Africa Centre.","9183622; 9183623 (contact); ","BARNIGHAUSEN, TILL ; TANSER, FRANK COURTENEY (contact);","WHITE, DELLA ","09/11/2015","06/30/2020","Adult; Africa; Africa South of the Sahara; Age; antiretroviral therapy; Area; Attention; Attitude; Autopsy; Behavior Therapy; Behavioral; behavioral response; Biological; Biological Markers; Blood; Caring; Cause of Death; Cessation of life; Clinic; Clinical; cohort; Collection; Communities; Data; Demographic Analyses; design; Disease; Ensure; Epidemiology; evidence base; Exposure to; Financial compensation; follow-up; Funding; Future; Goals; Health; Health Services Accessibility; high risk; HIV; HIV antiretroviral; HIV Infections; HIV risk; Household; Human immunodeficiency virus test; Improve Access; improved outcome; Incidence; Individual; Intervention; Knowledge; Life; Life Expectancy; Link; Measures; member; Mentors; mortality; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development; national surveillance; next generation; optimism; Paper; Pathway interactions; Patients; Perception; Persons; Population; population based; population health; Population Study; Postdoctoral Fellow; Prevention; Prevention strategy; Preventive; Preventive Intervention; programs; public health relevance; Public Health Schools; Public Sector; Publishing; Records; Recovery; Recruitment Activity; Research; Research Infrastructure; Residencies; Risk; Risk Reduction; Role; Rural; Rural Community; rural South Africa; Savings; scale up; Schools; Science; Sex Behavior; Shapes; socioeconomics; South Africa; South African; Spottings; surveillance data; Testing; therapy adherence; Treatment Efficacy; Treatment Failure; United States National Institutes of Health; Universities; Viral Load result; Work; ","Causal Pathways to population health impact of HIV antiretroviral treatment","084233","ACE","AIDS Clinical Studies and Epidemiology Study Section ","","","04","428452","22377","450829",""

These adverse outcomes are due in part to the ability of existing drugs to inadvertently activate the target receptors they are meant to inactivate. We have identified biologics that inhibit the target receptors without activating it.

As successful malaria control measures have been implemented, transmission in some regions has declined, resulting in a decrease in parasite diversity and the emergence and persistence of specific parasite genotypes in multiple individuals in the population. Using genetic and genomic techniques and a translational systems biology approach, we will determine whether the persistence of specific parasite genotypes is related to neutralizing genotype-specific immunity, enhanced transmission potential, or undiscovered asymptomatic reservoirs, ultimately allowing the development of targeted genotype-transcendent interventions.","9563291; ","BEI, AMY KRISTINE;","SINA, BARBARA J","09/28/2016","06/30/2021","5 year old; Affect; Africa; Africa South of the Sahara; analytical tool; Anopheles Genus; Anti-malarial drug resistance; Antibody Response; Antigenic Diversity; Antigenic Variation; Antigens; attributable mortality; B-Lymphocyte Epitopes; base; Biological Assay; Biology; career; Cause of Death; Cells; Child; Clinical; cohesion; Collaborations; Communicable Diseases; Communities; Complex; Country; Culicidae; Data; Department chair; Development; Disease Outbreaks; Drug resistance; Endemic Diseases; Epitopes; Erythrocytes; Evolution; experience; Exposure to; Family; feeding; Female; Flow Cytometry; Frequencies; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Variation; Genomic approach; genomic epidemiology; Genomics; Genotype; Goals; Growth; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Hospitals; Human; Immune; Immune Evasion; immune resistance; Immune response; Immune system; Immunity; Immunoglobulin G; Immunoglobulins; Immunology; In Vitro; Individual; Infection; Infectious Diseases Research; innovation; Institutes; Institution; International; Intervention; Knowledge; Laboratories; Ligands; Light; Longitudinal cohort; Longitudinal cohort study; Malaria; Malaria Vaccines; male; Measures; member; Membrane; Mentors; Mentorship; Molecular; Molecular Genetics; Monitor; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease; Parasites; Parasitology; Pathogenesis; Patients; Plasmodium falciparum; Play; Population; Population Genetics; Positioning Attribute; Prevalence; Process; programs; Public Health; Public Health Schools; Research; Research Activity; Research Personnel; resistance mechanism; Resources; Role; Scientist; Seasons; Senegal; spatiotemporal; Standardization; Surface Antigens; Systems Biology; Techniques; Technology; Testing; The science of Mycology; Time; tool; Training; Training Activity; Transcript; transcriptomics; transmission process; Tropical Disease; United States; United States National Institutes of Health; Universities; Vaccines; Variant; vector mosquito; vector transmission; Virulence; ","Employing genetic and genomic surveillance to reveal mechanisms of malaria parasite persistence","010496","ICP1","International and Cooperative Projects - 1 Study Section ","","","02","123675","9174","132849",""

This has obviously catastrophic implications for the future of humanity. Sepsis is the third leading cause of death in the United States with an annual toll of over 230,000 people. Survival rates have been reported to drop by 7.6% per hour appropriate treatment is delayed. This drastic drop in survival rate leads to vast over prescription of antibiotics in hospital settings. ElectroCyt, Inc. is an early stage company that has raised angel investment and licensed its core technology from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The company aims to develop a system to more intelligently optimize the use of and potential de-escalation of antibiotics in acute care settings. The system consists of a hand-held electronic reader and accompanying pipeline of disposable cartridges to measure cell counts, cell surface protein expression, and plasma protein expression from a drop of blood. Measurement of the blood biomarkers combined with a predictive analytics machine learning approach will accurately capture the patient?s immune state as a progression of recovery from an adverse event. This system, consisting of a device to measure biomarkers rapidly from blood and a machine learning algorithm, could provide real time feedback to physicians describing an individual patient?s specific response to the administered antibiotics. This could help to eliminate unnecessary antibiotics while the pathogen is being identified and to de-escalate the antibiotics at higher susceptibility to resistance much faster.","12321050; ","REDDY, BOBBY ;","","09/01/2017","02/28/2018","","Point of Care Device for Reducing Overuse of Antibiotics in Potentially Septic Hospital Populations","000521","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","","","150000",""

With this fellowship, the proposed research will develop and characterize an antibiotic-releasing porous space maintainer for mandibular defects, evaluate its efficacy to halt infection in vivo, and determine the effects of local infection and local treatment on bone growth at distal sites, contributing important knowledge in the development of bioengineering strategies to improve functional and aesthetic repair of the craniofacial complex.","14971842; ","WATSON, EMMA ;","FRIEDEN, LESLIE A","08/17/2017","08/16/2020","3D Print; Address; Affect; Animal Model; Animal Testing; Animals; Anti-Infective Agents; Antibiotic Resistance; Antibiotics; Autologous Transplantation; Bacteria; Bacterial Infections; base; Biocompatible Materials; Biomedical Engineering; Bioreactors; Blood; bone; bone engineering; Bone Growth; Bone Regeneration; Bone Tissue; Bone Transplantation; cell type; Ceramics; Clinical; combat; commercialization; Communication; Complex; Congenital Abnormality; craniofacial; Craniofacial Abnormalities; craniofacial complex; craniofacial repair; Custom; cytokine; Defect; design; Development; Dimensions; Disease; Distal; Distant; Ensure; Esthetics; Evaluation; Excision; Fellowship; Focal Infection; Geometry; Goals; Growth; Harvest; healing; Heart Rate; High Pressure Liquid Chromatography; Histology; Hydroxyapatites; Immune response; Implant; implantation; improved; in vivo; Incidence; Infection; Inflammation; inflammatory marker; Investigation; Kinetics; Knowledge; Lead; Literature; long bone; Maintenance; Mandible; maxillofacial; mechanical properties; Mechanics; member; Methods; Minimum Inhibitory Concentration measurement; Modeling; Molds; Monitor; Morbidity - disease rate; Mucous Membrane; novel; novel strategies; Oral; Oral cavity; Organ Transplantation; Outcome; Patients; Periosteum; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Polymers; Polymethyl Methacrylate; Porosity; Property; Publishing; reconstruction; Repair Complex; repaired; Research; response; rib bone structure; scaffold; Shapes; Sinus; Site; Skin; soft tissue; Specific qualifier value; Surgeon; Swab; System; Temperature; Testing; Therapeutic; Thinness; Time; Tissue Donors; Tissue Engineering; tissue repair; Tissues; tomography; tool; Trauma; tumor; Validation; Work; ","'A Two-Stage High-Fidelity, Anti-Infective Approach to Craniofacial Repair in Novel Ovine Model'","027586","DSR","NIDR Special Grants Review Committee ","","","01","44844","","44844",""

An estimated 50% of women will experience lower urinary tract symptoms some point during their lifetime. Such symptoms are harmful enough in themselves, but they can lead to incontinence, infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, and psychological distress. The objective of this program is to carry out epidemiologic studies to determine biological and behavioral factors that can lead to lower urinary tract symptoms and related illnesses, and to find ways to prevent progression to clinical symptoms and more serious complications.

Unlike other musculoskeletal problems, there is a clear shortage of treatment options between the onset of TMDs and total joint replacement for severe disease. The objective of this project is to continue work toward elucidating TMJ structure-function relationships and tissue engineering a functional TMJ disc that also includes its attachments. Following a systematic approach, employing exogenous agents and the development of cogent surgical approaches, the tissue engineered TMJ disc complex will be investigated in vivo.

Our laboratory discovered that Cytc is regulated by phosphorylation. In this study, we will analyze the structural changes brought about by phosphorylation of Cytc in kidneys, determine whether and to what extent phosphorylation affects the functions of Cytc in respiration and apoptosis, identify the signaling molecules that mediate the reversible phosphorylations, and study the physiological effect in mice. Since cellular respiration and apoptosis are dysregulated in many diseases such as diabetes, neurodegeneration, and cancer, this study is expected to lead to better understanding and control of such diseases.","7735035; ","HUTTEMANN, MAIK ;","MAAS, STEFAN ","09/08/2017","07/31/2021","adenylate kinase; Affect; Affinity Chromatography; Amino Acids; Animals; Apoptosis; apoptotic protease-activating factor 1; Applications Grants; Bacteria; base; Binding; Candidate Disease Gene; Cattle; Cell Death; Cell Line; Cell Respiration; Cells; Cellular Stress; Cessation of life; Crystallography; cytochrome c; cytochrome c oxidase; Cytoprotection; Data; Diabetes Mellitus; Disease; Electron Transport; Electrons; experience; experimental study; Functional disorder; Generations; genetic approach; Glutamates; Goals; Heart; In Vitro; in vivo; Kidney; Knock-out; Knockout Mice; Laboratories; Lead; Left; Life; Liver; Malignant Neoplasms; Maps; Mass Spectrum Analysis; Measurement; Mediating; Membrane Potentials; Metabolic; Methods; Mitochondria; mitochondrial membrane; Mitochondrial Proteins; Modeling; Modification; Mus; mutant; Nerve Degeneration; novel; Null Lymphocytes; Organ; overexpression; Oxidative Phosphorylation; Oxygen; Pathologic; Pathway interactions; Pharmacology; Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases; Phosphorylation; Phosphorylation Site; Phosphotransferases; Physiological; Play; Positioning Attribute; Post-Translational Protein Processing; prevent; Process; Production; Property; Protein Dephosphorylation; Proteins; Protocols documentation; Rattus; Reaction; Reactive Oxygen Species; Regulation; Research; Respiration; Role; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Signaling Molecule; Stress; Techniques; Testing; Tissues; Transgenic Mice; Transgenic Organisms; Tyrosine; Variant; Water; Work; X-Ray Crystallography; ","Control of Cell Respiration and Apoptosis by Phosphorylation of Cytochrome c","116807","CSRS","Cellular Signaling and Regulatory Systems Study Section ","","A1","01","238578","128832","367410",""

This project will explore the link between a causative infectious agent (GAS) that produces an aberrant autoimmune response in the host (Th17 cells and autoantibodies) with induction of neuroinflammation, neurovascular pathology and neuronal circuitry dysfunction. Since Th17 cells have been implicated in tissue damage in several autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis, this proposal will consolidate the role of Th17 cells as key players in the pathogenesis of autoimmune encephalitic syndromes, that were primarily thought to be mediated by circulating autoantibodies and elucidate the mechanisms of how autoantibodies gain access to the brain. This proposal represents a novel and exciting breakthrough in our understanding of how bacterial infections that produce an aberrant immune response can impair brain function and mental health and aid in development of potential therapeutics to treat GAS-induced BGEs.","11090706 (contact); 9014310; ","AGALLIU, DRITAN  (contact); CUTFORTH, TYLER ;","DESMOND, NANCY L","09/08/2017","08/31/2021","Acute; adaptive immune response; adaptive immunity; Adenoidal structure; Adoptive Transfer; Antibodies; Autoantibodies; Autoimmune Diseases; Autoimmune encephalitis; Autoimmune Process; Autoimmune Responses; Axon; Bacterial Infections; Basal Ganglia; Behavior; Behavioral; Behavioral Assay; Blood - brain barrier anatomy; Blood Vessels; Brain; Brain region; CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes; Cells; Cellular Structures; Cerebrovascular system; chemokine; Child; Childhood; Corpus striatum structure; Cues; Defect; Deposition; Development; Diagnosis; Disease; Dopamine; Dopamine Receptor; Dorsal; Encephalitis; experimental study; Extravasation; Functional disorder; Future; Genetic; Globus Pallidus; Human; Immune; Immune response; Impairment; in vivo two-photon imaging; Infection; Infectious Agent; inhibitor/antagonist; Interleukin-17; Intravenous; Light; Link; loss of function; Lymphocyte; Lymphoid Tissue; Measures; Mediating; Mental disorders; Mental Health; migration; Motor; Motor Activity; motor deficit; Movement; Movement Disorders; Multiple Sclerosis; Mus; Mutant Strains Mice; neural circuit; neuroinflammation; neuronal circuitry; Neurons; Neurophysiology - biologic function; neuropsychiatric disorder; neurovascular; neurovascular injury; Nose; novel; olfactory bulb; Olfactory Nerve; Olfactory Pathways; olfactory sensory neurons; Output; Pathogenesis; Pathologic; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pharmacology; Play; Presynaptic Terminals; prevent; Production; Proteins; Public Health; receptor; Rodent; Role; Route; Sensory; Slice; Smell Perception; Streptococcal Infections; Streptococcus pyogenes; Substantia nigra structure; Sydenham Chorea; Symptoms; Synapses; Synaptic Transmission; Syndrome; T-Lymphocyte; Testing; Therapeutic; Tissues; trafficking; ","Cellular and humoral immune mechanisms underlying neurovascular dysfunction in autoimmune encephalitis","112849","CNBT","Clinical Neuroimmunology and Brain Tumors Study Section ","","","01","218279","133428","351707",""

Ethnically Chinese and Malaysian mental health patients were studied in Singapore and patients taking anti-psychotic medications were found to have TD in 40% and 29% of cases respectively. Regardless of prevalence, TD is a threat to patient adherence and quality of life. TD only remits in a minority of cases and can be permanent. With 50 million prescriptions for anti-psychotics written annually, more than 10 million persons living with a chronic mental illness are at risk of developing TD.

The Division of Food Safety is responsible for assuring the public of a safe, wholesome and properly represented food supply through permitting and inspection of food establishments, inspection of food products, and performance of specialized laboratory analyses on a variety of food products sold or produced in the State. The Division monitors food from farm gate through processing and distribution to the retail point of purchase. As the primary regulatory food testing laboratory for Florida the FDACS Food Laborartories work with our Department's Bureau of Food Inspection to conduct microbiological and chemical food analyses on behalf of the state's manufactured food regulatory programs (MFRPS). These analyses are conducted within the scope of our ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation. In addition, the FDACS Bureau of Food Laboratories assists other State agencies such as the Florida Department of Health in the investigation of food borne illness through the testing of food products that are suspected in food borne illness outbreaks. The FDACS Food Laboratories are active participants in PulseNet and Genome Trackr and routinely submit subtyping data of pathogens isolated from food products. The FDACS Bureau of Food Laboratories is willing and able to participate in this opportunity, and is fully committed, to increase the analytical capacity of our nation's food testing regulatory laboratory under accreditation, increase our ability to share laboratory results to promote earlier identification and regulatory response to adulterants in the food supply, advancement of a nationally integrated food safety system, and thereby enhance efforts to protect the food supply and work toward ensuring the public's health. The FDACS Division of Food Safety particpates in the Manufactured Food Regulatory Program with sample collection and inspections performed by the Bureau of Food Inspection and testing performed the the FDACS Food Laboratories, who also operates under the Division of Food Safety. Food Laboratories are active participants in multiple Federal Programs including being a FDA FERN CAP lab in both the chemistry and microbiological areas under grant number 1U18FD005506. In addition, the Food Laboratories are a USDA FERN grant participant. The FDACS Food Laboratories currently analyze over 7000 food samples per year with the current sample load including FDA and USDA regulated products and environmental swab samples from food manufacturing facilities.

And yet: HIV incidence and mortality rates remain unacceptably high in this HIV-endemic setting. To inform future implementation of ART programs, including under treatment-as-prevention scenarios, further evidence is needed in two areas: first, the mechanisms through which ART scale-up reduces HIV incidence - the 'pathways to prevention' - and in particular, the role of behavioral vs. biological pathways in determining community level incidence rates; and second, the reasons why people are still dying from HIV in the era of free and widely available ART. Information in these areas will inform wrap-around behavioral prevention interventions to augment treatment as prevention strategies and will shape efforts to improve outcomes across the cascade of HIV care and treatment. Evidence in these two areas will be critical to reducing the large lingering burden of HIV disease in South Africa. To establish this critical evidence base, we will analyze longitudinal health and demographic surveillance data collected by the Africa Centre for a complete population cohort in rural KwaZulu-Natal. These data include population-based HIV biomarker collection, data on sexual behaviors and ART knowledge and attitudes, and verbal autopsies to determine causes of all deaths in the population. Further, clinical records from the national ART program have been linked into the surveillance by national ID, enabling us to observe individuals as they progress through the complete cascade of HIV care, from HIV infection to recovery on ART, or death. Through epidemiological analysis, we will: determine the pathways through which high ART coverage reduces HIV incidence at the population level; and establish the determinants of HIV mortality in age of widespread ART availability. The study team is led by South Africa PI Frank Tanser, University of KwaZulu- Natal, and US PI Till Barnighausen, Harvard School of Public Health, and will support several mentored post- doctoral opportunities at the Africa Centre.","9183622; 9183623 (contact); ","BARNIGHAUSEN, TILL ; TANSER, FRANK COURTENEY (contact);","WHITE, DELLA ","09/11/2015","06/30/2020","","Causal Pathways to population health impact of HIV antiretroviral treatment","084233","ACE","AIDS Clinical Studies and Epidemiology Study Section ","","","03","424169","22152","446321",""
