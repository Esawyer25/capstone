Sadly, more than 50% of smokers who become pregnant continue to smoke and approximately 20% of expenditures for childhood respiratory illness are caused by maternal smoking amounting to over $1 billion annually in current health care dollars. The findings from this project will support the addition of daily vitamin C supplementation to pregnant smokers, a simple, safe, and inexpensive adjunct to current smoking cessation counseling that would significantly decrease the impact of smoking during pregnancy on child respiratory health both in the United States and world-wide.","7622703; ","MCEVOY, CYNTHIA T;","NOEL, PATRICIA ","07/15/2012","05/31/2022","1 year old; 5 year old; Address; Adverse effects; Affect; Age; Age-Months; American; Ancillary Study; Animal Model; Antismoking; Ascorbic Acid; Asthma; Birth; Blinded; Breathing; Carbon Monoxide; Child; Childhood; Childhood Asthma; Clinical Investigator; cohort; cost; Counseling; Data; Depressed mood; design; Double-Blind Method; environmental tobacco smoke exposure; Exhalation; Expenditure; follow-up; Funding; Future; Goals; Hair; Healthcare; Hospitalization; Human; Human Resources; improved; Incidence; Infant; infant outcome; Intervention; Lead; Life; Longitudinal Studies; Lung; lung development; maternal cigarette smoking; Measurement; Measures; Mothers; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; Newborn Infant; Nicotine; nicotine use in pregnancy; offspring; Oscillometry; Outcome; Participant; Patients; Pattern; Phenotype; Pilot Projects; Placebos; pre-clinical; Pregnancy; pregnant; prenatal; prenatal exposure; primary outcome; protective effect; Public Health; Publishing; pulmonary function; Pulmonary function tests; Questionnaires; Randomized; randomized trial; Recruitment Activity; Recurrence; Reporting; Resources; respiratory; respiratory health; Respiratory physiology; Respiratory Tract Infections; Risk; Sample Size; Sampling; Schedule; secondary outcome; Smoke; Smoker; Smoking; smoking cessation; Spirometry; Structure; study population; Supplementation; Swab; Time; TimeLine; United States; United States National Institutes of Health; Visit; Wheezing; Woman; ","VCSIP2: CCC - Lead Application","105447","CLTR","Clinical Trials Review Committee ","","","06","791507","263779","1055286",""

Relevance of the proposed project to the mission of the NIH (NIDDK and the Office of Dietary Supplements [ODS]): The research addresses important health issues of relevance to both NIDDK and ODS. Nutrition and type 2 diabetes are two obvious areas of interest to NIDDK while vitamin D is a nutrient of significant interest to ODS. Consistent with its strategic planning for 2010-14, the ODS is leading a vitamin D Initiative, which is an evolving partnership with NIH and other federal agencies to fund research that address gaps in knowledge, such as those stated by the 2011 Institute of Medicine report on dietary reference intakes for vitamin D. The Institute of Medicine report specifically identified the link between vitamin D and diabetes as one of the most promising non-skeletal outcomes that require further research with rigorously done trials.","6625628; ","PITTAS, ANASTASSIOS G;","MALOZOWSKI, SAUL N","06/01/2013","05/31/2018","25-hydroxyvitamin D; Address; Age; Albumins; American; Ancillary Study; Applications Grants; Area; arm; Ascorbic Acid; Beta Carotene; Beta Cell; Blood Pressure; Body Weight decreased; burden of illness; C-reactive protein; cardiovascular risk factor; Cardiovascular system; Cell secretion; Characteristics; Cholecalciferol; Clinical; clinical practice; Clinical Trials Design; cost; design; Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetes prevention; diabetes risk; Diet; dietary supplements; DNA; editorial; effective intervention; Endocrine; Ethnic Origin; Etiology; Event; Excretory function; experience; fasting plasma glucose; Folic Acid; follow-up; Functional disorder; Funding; Geographic Locations; Glucose; Glycosylated hemoglobin A; Goals; Grant; Health; high risk; Hormone replacement therapy; Hour; Hyperglycemia; improved; indexing; Individual; Institute of Medicine (U.S.); Insulin Resistance; insulin secretion; Intake; interest; Intervention; Knowledge; Laboratories; Life Style; Link; Lipids; Longitudinal observational study; Masks; Measures; Mission; modifiable risk; Multicenter Trials; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases; Natural History; Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; novel diagnostics; Nutrient; nutrition; Observational Study; OGTT; Oral; Outcome; parallelization; Participant; Persons; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacotherapy; Placebo Control; Placebos; Plasma; Population; Prediabetes syndrome; prevent; Prevention; prevention clinical trial; Preventive Intervention; Primary Prevention; protective effect; Public Health; public health relevance; Publishing; Race; Randomized; Reporting; Research; Research Personnel; Research Priority; Residual state; response; Risk; Risk Factors; Role; Safety; safety testing; Selenium; Societies; Strategic Planning; Subgroup; Supplementation; Symptoms; Testing; Time; United States National Institutes of Health; Urine; Vertebral column; Vitamin A; Vitamin D; Vitamin D supplementation; Vitamin D2; waist circumference; weight maintenance; Whole Blood; Work; ","Vitamin D and type 2 diabetes (D2d)","098245","ZDK1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","05","5902549","647451","6550000",""

Thus, there is strong justification for continued study of the consequences of such exposure. However, the combined total number of GB/GF exposed veterans in these past studies (N=130) represents a tiny fraction of the more than 100,000 GW veterans with suspected exposure. Therefore, the goal of this study is to replicate and extend our previous findings in a new, non-overlapping sample of 150 GW veterans from the exposure zone and 150 unexposed matched veterans with cognitive tests, structural, and diffusion tensor imaging. Because reduced brain volume and cognitive impairment may increase one's vulnerability to dementia, if we find evidence of neurodegeneration in yet another cohort of GB/GF-exposed GW veterans, this could have implications for the VA to employ dementia preventive measures in the treatment of these veterans as they approach old age.","8640463; ","CHAO, LINDA L;","","10/01/2013","12/31/2017","Acute; Age; age group; Alcohol or Other Drugs use; Alcohols; Alzheimer's Disease; Anisotropy; Apolipoprotein E; Apolipoproteins; attack victim; Attention; Behavioral; Biological; Brain; brain abnormalities; brain volume; California; cerebral atrophy; cognitive function; cognitive performance; cognitive testing; cohort; Complex; Confounding Factors (Epidemiology); cyclosarin; Dementia; dentate gyrus; Department of Defense; depressive symptoms; Diffuse; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Dose; Education; experience; Exposure to; Genotype; Goals; gray matter; Gulf War; Health; hippocampal atrophy; Hippocampal Formation; Hippocampus (Brain); Hour; Image; Impaired cognition; Impairment; improved; indexing; Iraq; Kansas; Measures; Memory; Meteorology; Military Personnel; Modeling; Nerve Degeneration; Neurodegenerative Disorders; Pathologic; performance tests; Pharmacology; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders; Preventive measure; public health relevance; Questionnaires; Rattus; Reaction Time; Research; Retrieval; Sampling; Sarin; Severities; sex; Smoking; stem; Subway; Testing; Tokyo; Uncertainty; Verbal Learning; Veterans; white matter; ","Longitudinal assessment of Gulf War veterans with suspected Sarin exposure","000798","SPLD","Special Emphasis - Research on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses ","","","04","","","",""

Recently, it was shown that the prevalence of osteoporosis and associated disabilities for Veterans is significantly underestimated, with such disorders present in up to 31% of VA patients. Hip fractures, a major risk with osteoporosis lead to loss of independence, increased health care costs and even embolic myocardial infarction or stroke. Most VA orthopedic patients suffering from osteoporosis have additional co-morbidities that may also affect bone formation, in particular diabetes. The proposed research study is to look at a novel factor, the cytokine SDF-1, how it is altered in the blood, particularly with age, and how this may be a key cause of bone loss leading to osteoporosis. Further, this proposal will look at patients receiving a new family of anti-diabetic drugs that may be able to alter this process, reduce bone loss and may be a novel treatment for osteoporosis.","1893200; ","HILL, WILLIAM D;","","01/01/2014","12/31/2017","Acute; Adipocytes; Affect; Age; age effect; age related; Age-Related Bone Loss; Aging; American; Antidiabetic Drugs; Binding; Blood; Blood Circulation; bone; bone age; bone cell; Bone Density; Bone Growth; bone loss; Bone Marrow; Bone Marrow Cells; bone quality; Bone Regeneration; Bone remodeling; Brain; Cardiac; cell motility; Cell Survival; Cells; chemokine; Cleaved cell; Clinical Trials; Comorbidity; CSF3 gene; CXCL12 gene; CXCR4 gene; CXCR4 Receptors; cytokine; density; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; diabetic; diabetic patient; Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV; disability; Disease; Endopeptidases; Engraftment; Environment; Epigenetic Process; Excision; Family; FDA approved; Follow-Up Studies; Fracture; Funding; Gene Expression; Genes; Grant; Health Care Costs; Hip Fractures; Hip region structure; Homeostasis; Homing; Human; Impairment; improved; In Vitro; in vitro activity; in vivo; Inflammatory; inhibitor/antagonist; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I; Laboratories; Lead; Leptin; Link; lipid biosynthesis; Maintenance; male; Measures; men; Mesenchymal; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; MicroRNAs; Modeling; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Mus; Myocardial Infarction; N-terminal; novel; Orthopedics; osteoblast differentiation; Osteoblasts; Osteocytes; Osteogenesis; osteogenic; Osteoporosis; Pain; Patients; Peripheral; peripheral blood; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacology; Plasma; Play; Population; Post-Translational Protein Processing; Post-Translational Regulation; pre-clinical; precursor cell; Prevalence; prevent; Process; Production; protein expression; Protein Isoforms; Public Health; public health relevance; Receptor Signaling; Recruitment Activity; Reducing Agents; Regulation; Reporting; Research; research study; response; Risk; Role; Serum; Serum Markers; Signal Transduction; Site; Spinal Fractures; stem cell differentiation; stem cell population; Stem cells; stroke; Stromal Cell-Derived Factor 1; substantia spongiosa; Testing; Time; Tissues; Transplantation; Traumatic injury; United States National Institutes of Health; Veterans; Woman; Work; ","Bad to the Bone: Age-related Increases in Serum SDF-1 Leads to Bone Loss with Age","000930","CAMM","Cellular and Molecular Medicine ","","","04","","","",""

However, how different populations of the secretory granules inside the mast cell fuse to the cell membrane to release their specific contents (called degranulation) is poorly understood. In this study, we propose to delineate distinct degranulation pathways for different mast cell mediators.

Cognitive processing therapy (cognitions only) will be the treatment. Genome wide methylation will be examined in concert with a focused study of glucocorticoid receptor regulation and function so as to identify predictors and correlates of PTSD risk, recovery, persistence, and resistance.

In common with other chronic pain syndromes, evidence suggests some DE patients display corneal nerve damage and neuropathic pain. In this program, we address a major unmet need by using a comprehensive pain assessment protocol, including for the first time corneal pain thresholds to determine the neuro-ophthalmologic pathology underlying DE subtypes. We will then determine the relationship between ocular surface biomarkers of environmental stress and corneal injury with these DE subtypes. Finally, we utilize state-of-the-art proprietary genomic technology to assess candidate genes implicated in DE susceptibility and integrate all of these data to facilitate more accurate diagnosis, prognosis, and mechanism-based therapeutic development.

If not treated promptly, sleep apnea may result in daytime fatigue that is associated with increased prevalence of accidents in the workplace or while driving. Sleep apnea may also result in the development of hypertension, cerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage, and ventricular arrhythmias that may lead to death. Thus, a significant amount of empirical evidence suggests that sleep apnea is a major health concern in the Veteran population. Consequently, discovering mechanisms that lead to the development of novel strategies and treatments to minimize apnea is important. In the present proposal we will achieve this mandate by determining whether or not the circadian timing system has a significant role in modulating the severity of sleep apnea. Likewise, we will use the role that the circadian timing system has in modulating sleep apnea severity to test novel strategies that might improve compliance of traditional treatments (i.e. continuous positive airway pressure).","8579727; ","MATEIKA, JASON H.;","","04/01/2009","12/31/2017","Accidents; airway muscle; Apnea; Arousal; Automobile Driving; Breathing; Carbon Dioxide; Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage; Cessation of life; Characteristics; Circadian Rhythms; Compliance behavior; Computer Simulation; Continuous Positive Airway Pressure; Cyclization; design; Development; Disease; Drowsiness; Environmental air flow; Event; Exposure to; Fatigue; Funding; Health; Hour; Human; Hypercapnia; Hyperpnea; Hypertension; Hypoxia; improved; indexing; Individual; Lead; Measures; Modification; Napping; neuromuscular; novel; novel strategies; Participant; Patients; Pattern; Population; pressure; Prevalence; Property; public health relevance; Recurrence; respiratory; response; Role; Schedule; Severities; Sleep; Sleep Apnea Syndromes; Subarachnoid Hemorrhage; System; Testing; Therapeutic; Time; treatment strategy; Ventricular Arrhythmia; Veterans; Wakefulness; Workplace; ","Circadian Modulation of Breathing Stability and Respiratory Plasticity","000125","PULM","Respiration ","","","08","","","",""

A goal of the proposed experiments is to understand how fat cells increase in number and size during weight gain, with the ultimate goal to identify therapeutic targets against obesity, diabete and related metabolic diseases that are epidemic in modern societies.","10442715; ","STEGER, DAVID J.;","HAFT, CAROL R","06/15/2013","05/31/2018","3T3-L1 Cells; Address; adipocyte differentiation; Adipocytes; adipokines; Adipose tissue; Affect; Agreement; Automobile Driving; Binding; Binding Sites; Body Weight; Brown Fat; CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins; Cell Differentiation process; cell type; Cells; ChIP-seq; Chromatin; Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing; Chromatin Loop; chromatin protein; chromosome conformation capture; combat; Comorbidity; Complex; Data; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; diet and exercise; Disease; Distal; DNA; Elements; Epidemic; epigenomics; experimental study; Fatty acid glycerol esters; Fibroblasts; fighting; Gene Expression; Gene Targeting; Genes; Genetic Transcription; Genome; genome-wide; Genomic Segment; Genomics; Glucocorticoid Receptor; Glucose; Goals; Health Benefit; histone modification; Homeostasis; Human; Hyperlipidemia; hypertensive heart disease; in vivo; innovation; insight; Insulin Resistance; Link; lipid biosynthesis; lipid metabolism; Lipids; Liver; Location; loss of function; Maps; Mediating; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Metabolic; Metabolic Diseases; Methods; Minority; Modernization; Modification; Molecular; Molecular Conformation; Mus; Obesity; Organ; Pathway interactions; Physiology; Play; Population; Positioning Attribute; programs; promoter; Promoter Regions; Public Health; public health relevance; Publishing; Recruitment Activity; Research; Risk; Role; Site; Societies; subcutaneous; targeted treatment; Testing; therapeutic target; Tissues; transcription factor; Transcription Initiation; Transcriptional Regulation; United States; Visceral; Weight Gain; ","Transcriptional and epigenomic control of adipose tissue development and function","098542","CADO","Cellular Aspects of Diabetes and Obesity Study Section ","","","05","217500","130500","348000",""

Given the rapidly expanding cohort of women veterans who will require treatment for PTSD, it is critical that research be expanded to include women veterans and to identify underlying mechanisms of risk and resilience for PTSD that may differ by sex. The proposed study will characterize sex differences in fear extinction, a core mechanism of PTSD, which may account for the higher prevalence of PTSD in women. Additional aims include examining candidate biomarkers that have a sex-specific association with fear extinction and PTSD that may explain the differential risk.

Endoscopic screening among individuals with GERD for the precancerous lesion of Barrett's esophagus is widely practiced. But screening based on GERD alone is very inefficient because GERD symptoms are very common and the cancer is uncommon: approximately 150,000 veterans receive a new diagnosis of GERD annually, and approximately 16% undergo upper endoscopy, but fewer than 1% of them are found to have esophageal cancer. And yet the vast majority of patients who develop the cancer never had undergone upper endoscopy prior to their diagnosis of the cancer. The proposed study aims to validate a quick personalized tool for predicting the presence of Barrett's esophagus and future esophageal adenocarcinoma that could greatly improve the efficiency of endoscopic screening among veterans.","1949572; ","RUBENSTEIN, JOEL H;","","01/01/2015","12/31/2018","Accounting; Adult; Age; American; Anxiety; Barrett Esophagus; cancer diagnosis; Central obesity; Cigarette; circulating biomarkers; Clinical; cohort; Colon Carcinoma; Colonoscopy; Consensus; cost; cost effective; Development; Diagnosis; Digestive System Disorders; Discrimination; Dysplasia; Endoscopy; Enrollment; Esophageal Adenocarcinoma; Esophagogastroduodenoscopy; Esophagus; Frequencies; Funding; Future; Gastroenterologist; Gastroesophageal reflux disease; ghrelin; Goals; Guidelines; Heartburn; high risk; improved; Incidence; Individual; Interleukin-6; Leptin; Lesion; Longitudinal cohort; male; Malignant neoplasm of esophagus; Malignant Neoplasms; medical specialties; men; Mental Depression; Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award; Michigan; Modeling; mortality; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases; Neoplasms; Obesity; patient population; Patient risk; Patient Selection; Patients; personalized approach; Population; Predictive Factor; predictive tools; Premalignant; Probability; Proton Pump Inhibitors; psychological distress; public health relevance; Recommendation; Recruitment Activity; Research; Research Personnel; response; Retrospective Studies; Risk; Risk Factors; screening; Screening for cancer; sex; Symptoms; Tobacco; Tobacco use; tool; United States; Validation; Veterans; Waist-Hip Ratio; Woman; Work; ","Validation and Extension of the Michigan Barretts Esophagus pREdiction Tool (M-BERET)","000899","EPID","Epidemiology ","","","03","","","",""

Yet, there are no interventions specifically for suicide prevention that meet Veterans Health Affairs' quality recommendations requiring the provision of evidence-based, recovery-oriented psychotherapy, which are also feasible to use during a typical inpatient stay.9 The proposed study seeks to take a first step toward filling this gap. In consultation with experts in the field, the authors have developed a protocol applying a recovery-oriented, evidence-based treatment approach to Veteran inpatient care.

However, EMT also adversely causes organ fibrosis and promotes metastasis. EMT is implicated in most advanced gastrointestinal cancers including colorectal, esophageal, gastric and pancreatic and since over 85% of human cancers are derived from epithelial cells, the benefits of research on EMT would impact the bulk of solid tumors. Diabetic nephropathy is a leading worldwide cause of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease; similarly, fibrostenotic strictures are a well described complication of Crohn's disease, and the crucial pathology underlying both these conditions is EMT. Since EMT is reversible and antagonism of EMT repairs injured tissue, novel therapeutic targets could be designed to inhibit fibrogenesis, redress established fibrosis, improve the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer patients by impairing tumor progression, diminish the risk of recurrence, and eliminate drug resistance in cancer patients.","2264650; ","KHURANA, SEEMA ;","GREENWEL, PATRICIA ","09/18/2013","05/31/2018","Actin-Binding Protein; Actins; Adult; Apoptosis; Biochemical; Biological; Biological Assay; BRCA1 gene; brush border membrane; Cancer Patient; Cancer Prognosis; cancer therapy; cell motility; Cell Nucleus; cell type; Cells; Chronic Kidney Failure; Clinical; Clinical Trials; clinically significant; cohort; Colon; Colon Carcinoma; Colonic Neoplasms; Colorectal; Colorectal Cancer; Complex; Complication; Crohn's disease; Cytoskeleton; design; Development; Diabetic Nephropathy; Diagnosis; Disease; Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm; Drug resistance; effective therapy; End stage renal failure; Enrollment; Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor; Epithelial; Epithelial Cells; epithelial to mesenchymal transition; Esophageal; Event; experimental study; fibrogenesis; Fibrosis; gastrointestinal; Gene Expression; gene therapy; Generations; Genetic Transcription; Genitourinary system; Goals; Human; Impairment; improved; in vivo; injured; intestinal homeostasis; Intestines; Knockout Mice; Link; Malignant neoplasm of gastrointestinal tract; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; Mesenchymal; Molecular; Morphogenesis; mortality; Natural immunosuppression; Neoplasm Metastasis; new therapeutic target; novel; Nuclear; Nuclear Import; Organ; organ regeneration; Outcome; Pancreas; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase; Physiological; Physiological Processes; Play; prevent; Process; prognostic; programs; Property; protein-tyrosine kinase c-src; Proteins; public health relevance; Rationalization; Receptor Activation; Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases; Recurrence; Regulation; repaired; Reporting; Research; Research Design; Resources; Respiratory System; Respiratory tract structure; Risk; Role; SCID Mice; senescence; Severe Combined Immunodeficiency; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; slug; Solid Neoplasm; Specimen; SRC gene; Stem cells; Stomach; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Agents; therapeutic DNA; Time; Tissue Microarray; tissue regeneration; tissue repair; Tissues; trafficking; Transcription Coactivator; transcription factor; Translating; Tumor Cell Invasion; tumor progression; tumorigenesis; Tyrosine Phosphorylation; villin; Wound Healing; ","Epithelial mesenchymal transition in gastrointestinal homeostasis and disease","098120","GMPB","Gastrointestinal Mucosal Pathobiology Study Section ","","","05","217500","109838","327338",""

Lung OS metastasis responds poorly to conventional chemotherapy, accounting for most of the mortality related to OS. This research program aims to mitigate this clinical challenge by understanding how lung macrophages support OS growth in lung tissues through integrin interaction with tumor-associated adhesion molecules, and by defining IND-enabling pre-clinical experimentation to eventually employ FDA-approved anti-?4 antibody as an effective therapeutic approach to ameliorate pulmonary OS metastasis. Success in this effort will provide the foundation for exploiting VCAM-1 / ?4 integrin signaling as a concept for immunotherapy approaches against an otherwise deadly disease which has no alternative therapeutic options.","1902289; ","HUANG, ALEX YEE-CHEN;","SALOMON, RACHELLE ","06/20/2017","05/31/2019","Accounting; Adolescent; Adolescent and Young Adult; Affect; African American; Alveolar Macrophages; Antibodies; Autoimmune Diseases; Autoimmune Process; Binding; Blocking Antibodies; Bone Growth; boys; Breathing; Cell Adhesion Molecules; Cell Line; Cells; cellular targeting; Cervical; chemotherapy; Child; Childhood; Clinical; Clinical Trials; Combination Drug Therapy; Combined Modality Therapy; Complex; CRISPR/Cas technology; Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes; Data; Development; Diagnosis; Dichloromethylene Diphosphonate; Diphtheria Toxin; Disease; Disease-Free Survival; Dose; efficacy testing; FDA approved; Foundations; Functional disorder; functional outcomes; Future; Goals; Graft-vs-Host Disease; Grant; Growth; Human; imaging approach; Immune; Immune response; Immune system; Immunotherapy; improved; improved outcome; in vivo; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; insight; Integrin alpha4; Integrin alpha4beta1; Integrins; Intranasal Administration; ITGAM gene; Japan; Kinetics; Label; Laser Scanning Microscopy; Ligands; Liposomes; Literature; long bone; Lung; lung metastatic; macrophage; Macrophage-1 Antigen; Malignant - descriptor; Malignant Bone Neoplasm; malignant breast neoplasm; Malignant neoplasm of prostate; Measures; Mediating; Metastatic breast cancer; Metastatic Neoplasm to the Lung; Metastatic Osteosarcoma; Modeling; Molecular; Molecular Target; molecular targeted therapies; molecular/cellular imaging; Monitor; mortality; Multiple Sclerosis; Mus; Mutation; Myelogenous; natalizumab; Nebulizer; Neoplasm Metastasis; novel strategies; Operative Surgical Procedures; osteosarcoma; Outcome; overexpression; Patients; Pediatric Hospitals; Peptides; phase 1 study; Phenotype; Play; Population; pre-clinical; Precision therapeutics; preclinical study; prevent; programs; public health relevance; Quality of life; Regimen; Reporter; repository; Research; Resectable; Resistance; Role; Route; Signal Transduction; small hairpin RNA; small molecule inhibitor; Source; stroke; Structure of parenchyma of lung; success; Surface; systemic toxicity; T-Lymphocyte; Testing; Texas; Therapeutic; Time; Toxic effect; Translating; Treatment Efficacy; tumor; Tumor Antigens; two-photon; United States; Variant; Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1; Xenograft procedure; young adult; ","Targeting VCAM1-a4b1 Signaling to Ameliorate Pulmonary Osteosarcoma Metastasis","218790","ZCA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","130500","78137","208637",""

The VA has made fall prevention a priority but effective programs only reduce falls by 30%. Tai Chi has been effective at improving balance but may not prevent falls. Most falls occur during walking when an individual experiences a slip or a trip. Programs that focus on walking, stepping, and recovery from a slip may be more effective at fall reduction than Tai Chi. This study will compare Tai Chi to our new multimodal balance intervention (MMBI). MMBI focuses on balance, walking, stepping, strength training, and recovery from a slip.

Despite the health burden imposed by glomerular disease, significant gaps exist in diagnosis, monitoring, and research that supports the effective treatment of these conditions. The primary glomerular disease (GDPrime) consortium will focus on four of those diseases, minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IGAN), and idiopathic membranous nephropathy (IMN). The GDPrime consortium will establish a comprehensive research program centered around a prospective, observational cohort study of 2400 cases and 2400 controls. The resources generated by this study will support a collaborative research program involving many areas of science and medicine, empower the network of scientists working with the consortium to accelerate their research based on the rich resources provided through the accumulated cohort, specimens, scientific and analytic capacity managed through the data coordinating center (DCC). Success of the GDPrime consortium will be measured by advances in disease mechanisms and therapeutic pathways, identification and validation of outcomes relevant to patients as well as clinicians, early phase testing of novel therapies and effective public-private-patient advocate partnership across disciplines.","7062199; 8825562 (contact); 9758004; ","GIPSON, DEBBIE S; KRETZLER, MATTHIAS  (contact); ROBINSON, BRUCE MARSHALL;","MOXEY-MIMS, MARVA M.","09/16/2013","05/31/2018","Address; Adult; Advocate; Ancillary Study; Area; base; biobank; Biology; Biopsy; case control; Cessation of life; Characteristics; Child; Childhood; Chronic; Clinical; Clinical Trials; cohort; Cohort Studies; Collaborations; Communities; Creatinine; Data; Data Analyses; Data Coordinating Center; data integration; data integrity; data management; Data Reporting; Data Set; demographics; Development; Diagnosis; diagnostic biomarker; Discipline; Disease; Disease Progression; dissemination research; effective therapy; End stage renal failure; Ensure; Epidemiology; Evaluation; Event; Extramural Activities; Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis; Functional disorder; Genetic Polymorphism; genome-wide; Goals; Health; human subject protection; Idiopathic Membranous Nephropathy; Immunoglobulin A; improved; Individual; Kidney; Kidney Diseases; Knowledge Extraction; Longitudinal cohort study; Measures; Medical Genetics; Medicine; Membranous Glomerulonephritis; Molecular Genetics; Monitor; novel; novel marker; novel therapeutics; Outcome; outcome forecast; Outcome Measure; outcome prediction; Pathway interactions; Patients; Phase; Physical Function; Population; predict clinical outcome; predictive marker; prevent; Private Sector; Privatization; Process; Prognostic Marker; programs; prospective; Prospective cohort study; Proteinuria; protocol development; public health relevance; Public Sector; Quality of life; Recruitment Activity; Renal function; Renal glomerular disease; Research; research data dissemination; Research Design; Research Infrastructure; Research Personnel; Research Support; Resources; response; Sampling; Science; Scientist; Specific qualifier value; Specimen; success; Symptoms; System; Systems Biology; targeted treatment; Testing; Text; Therapeutic; therapeutic target; Time; Training; United States; Validation; ","GDPrime","100845","ZDK1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","05","801152","105943","907095",""

Mammals rely on two related copper transporters, ATP7A and ATP7B, to regulate intracellular copper levels and coordinate its intestinal absorption and biliary excretion. This project will examine poorly understood aspects in the regulation of copper transport in mammals, namely the mechanisms responsible for trafficking of ATP7A/7B to and from early endosomes. Furthermore, these studies seek to uncover the role of a newly discovered cellular regulator of endosomal trafficking, and will result in important principles that govern the trafficking of a myriad other protein cargoes that traverse the endosome through this pathway.

However, executive functions are also diverse, each with relative costs and benefits, indicating the need for individuals to adaptively coordinate distinct forms of executive function, and highlighting the potential importance of this coordination process in development, life outcomes, and disorders. This project thus investigates how forms of executive function are adaptively coordinated across development to match ongoing demands and how this process relates to real-world functioning, highlighting fundamental but under-explored aspects of executive function and its development.

Obese individuals have been found to have increased severity of influenza infection and decreased response to influenza vaccines. Interestingly, gastrointestinal microbiome, which is altered in the obese state, has been found to be important for both influenza infection as well as vaccine responses. Therefore, the goal of these studies is to investigate how the ?obese? microbiome affects responses to influenza. These multidisciplinary studies focusing on gastrointestinal microbiome, obesity and influenza infection have an impact not only on the field of infectious disease but also on the fields of nutrition, immunology and virology and our overall understanding of public health in the context of nutritional status. The preponderance of interest in microbiome function and health as well as the functions of pro- and prebiotics in treating gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases make these studies timely and relevant. In addition, the results of this study may help, in time, to develop prediction algorithms or diagnostic techniques which determine individual risk for respiratory infection severity based on microbiome alone. Our laboratory is uniquely suited to undertake these studies and our findings will have a major impact on combating these significant public health concerns.","1954161; ","SCHULTZ-CHERRY, STACEY L;","HAUGUEL, TERESA M.","06/19/2017","05/31/2019","Acute Lung Injury; Affect; animal care; Animal Model; Animals; Bird Flu vaccine; Cessation of life; combat; Communicable Diseases; Communities; Core Facility; Data; Diagnostic Procedure; Distal; Dose; Ensure; Epidemic; experience; fecal transplantation; gastrointestinal; Gastrointestinal Diseases; Gastrointestinal tract structure; Goals; gut microbiome; Health; high risk population; House mice; Housing; Human; immune function; Immune system; Immunology; improved; Individual; Influenza; Influenza vaccination; Influenza virus vaccine; influenzavirus; interest; Laboratories; Lead; Lung; Lung diseases; lung injury; Metabolic; microbial; microbiome; microbiota; Modeling; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; mucosal site; multidisciplinary; Mus; nutrition; Nutritional status; Obese Mice; Obesity; obesogenic; pathogen; Pathogenesis; Physiological; Play; Population; prebiotics; predicting response; prediction algorithm; Predisposition; Primary Infection; prophylactic; Prophylactic treatment; Public Health; Research; Resources; Respiratory System; Respiratory Tract Infections; Respiratory tract structure; response; Risk; Role; Saint Jude Children's Research Hospital; seasonal influenza; Severities; success; Testing; Therapeutic; Thinness; Time; Tropism; Vaccination; vaccine response; vaccine trial; Vaccines; Viral; Viral Pathogenesis; Viral Respiratory Tract Infection; virology; virus pathogenesis; ","Obesity, Influenza and Microbiome","133527","VIRB","Virology - B Study Section ","","","01","50000","39750","89750",""

The manufacturing procedure for PfSPZ-based involves the extraction of salivary glands of mosquitoes by dissection. Our aim in this proposal is to first implement an interim semi- automated prototype for mosquito microdissection (sAMMS) in this key production step during pharmaceutical manufacturing. In parallel we will investigate and develop a fully automated system (fAMMS) for commercial-scale production to facilitate greater efficiencies, reduced timeframes, greatly reduced training periods, increased product purity, and mitigation of human error and operator fatigue.

Data from the previous two years shows that among the ~ 19,000 Veterans with MS who received care within the VA system, a significant percentage had one or more of the VDRF with hyperlipidemia in ~9300, hypertension in ~9200 and diabetes in ~3500. Since many of these VDRF are diet and life-style related and hence potentially modifiable, we urgently need to understand the underlying mechanisms between MS disease progression and VDRF.

Some cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) associated with increased risk of cognitive decline in samples under age 75 are diminished or even reversed in older samples. Most risk studies of the very elderly have predominantly female samples; this study of 75+ year old, cognitively intact male veterans is much more relevant to the VA mission. We will assess risk of cognitive decline associated with five CVRFs, and subjects over age 85 with those aged 75-84 years. Identifying CVRFs associated with particularly high risk of cognitive decline has the potential for targeting preventions against or treatments of cognitive decline. The innovation of this study is characterizing subgroups of the very elderly that are cognitively successful despite having CVRFs that suggest high risk for impairment. Identifying specific characteristics of such groups may lead to protective or preventive factors.","1897506; ","SILVERMAN, JEREMY M.;","","01/01/2014","12/31/2017","Age; aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alleles; Alzheimer's Disease; Apolipoprotein E; Blood Pressure; C-reactive protein; cardiovascular risk factor; Cardiovascular system; Characteristics; Cholesterol; Cognition; Cognitive; Cognitive aging; cognitive change; cohort; Communities; Computerized Medical Record; Consent; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dementia; Diabetes Mellitus; Disease; Disease Resistance; EFRAC; Elderly; Family member; Female; General Population; Genes; Glycosylated hemoglobin A; heart function; high risk; Immunologic Markers; Impaired cognition; Impairment; Individual; Inflammation; inflammatory marker; innovation; Intervention; Lead; Life Expectancy; Longitudinal Studies; male; Measures; Medical center; Memory; Memory Loss; Methods; Mission; neuropsychological; Neuropsychology; Normalcy; Outcome; Prevention; Preventive; Procedures; Public Health; public health relevance; Recruitment Activity; Resistance; Risk; Risk Factors; Sampling; Sampling Studies; Study Subject; Subgroup; success; Veterans; ","Cardiovascular RF and Successful Cognitive Aging in Very Old Male Veterans","000900","MHBB","Mental Health and Behavioral Science B ","","","04","","","",""

Affected patients are not candidates for medicines for sobriety or for liver transplant because of their drinking. They are also hospitalized and die at a higher rate than those who do not drink. The major causes of death are infections and inflammation caused by bacteria that go through their bowel wall. Therefore we need to stop this inflammation from occurring by studying the bowel microbes and their interactions with molecules such as bile acids, which can impact bowel integrity. We propose to study the interaction of bile acids with microbes in the bowels of cirrhotic patients who continue to drink compared to other cirrhotics and healthy people. We will also study the effect of bile acids and microbes independently and together on inflammation by transplanting stool from affected patients into germ-free mice or mice without any microbes. These studies will help us find out the mechanisms behind why these Veterans have inflammation and infections and help us design treatments to prevent these in the future.","8453929; ","BAJAJ, JASMOHAN S;","","01/01/2015","12/31/2018","Abstinence; Affect; Age; Alcohol abuse; Alcoholic Liver Diseases; Alcohols; Animals; Bacteria; Bacterial Translocation; Bile Acid Biosynthesis Pathway; Bile Acids; Bile fluid; Cause of Death; Cessation of life; Cirrhosis; cost; cytokine; Deoxycholic Acid; Development; drinking; Duodenum; Endotoxemia; Enterohepatic Circulation; Feces; Future; Gallbladder; Germ-Free; gut microbiome; gut microbiota; Health system; Hepatic; Hospitals; Human; Immunologic Markers; Individual; Infection; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Inflammatory disease of the intestine; inflammatory milieu; Injury; insight; Intervention; Intestinal Content; Intestines; Knowledge; Lead; Liver; Liver Cirrhosis; Liver diseases; liver transplantation; Mediating; Membrane; Microbe; microbiome; microbiota; Modeling; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; mouse model; Mucous Membrane; Mus; non-alcoholic; non-alcoholic fatty liver; novel; Organ failure; Pathogenesis; Patients; Pharmacology; prevent; Prevention; problem drinker; programs; public health relevance; Role; Serum; Severities; sobriety; stem; Systems Biology; Testing; Therapeutic; therapy design; Transplantation; Underserved Population; Veterans; ","Bile Acids and Gut Microbiome in the Pathogenesis of Inflammation in Cirrhosis","001076","GAST","Gastroenterology ","","","03","","","",""

A growing body of evidence suggests that nanoparticles can be used to effectively transport a therapeutic agent across the largely impermeable BBB, without concern for immunogenicity or toxicity. Additionally, preliminary data show that a specific long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), Lnc-BM (lncRNA for brain metastasis), is expressed in most brain metastatic tissues and is predictive of metastasis to the brain; thus, this proposal will identify the molecular mechanisms that are crucial to BCBM, especially in relation to Lnc-BM and the JAK2/STAT3 pathway, and subsequently demonstrate the biological consequence of using nanoparticle delivery of siRNAs against Lnc- BM in mouse models, with specific interest in the inhibition of brain metastatic lesion development.","10941578; ","LIN, CHUNRU ;","AULT, GRACE S.","06/20/2017","05/31/2022","Address; American; Attenuated; Biological; biomarker identification; Blood - brain barrier anatomy; Blood Vessels; bone; Brain; brain tissue; Breast Cancer Cell; Breast Cancer Patient; cancer cell; Cause of Death; Cells; Characteristics; chemotherapy; Clinical; Data; Development; Disease; Distal; Drug Delivery Systems; Early Diagnosis; Early identification; Encapsulated; Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor; Estrogen Receptors; experimental study; fight against; Goals; Human; immunogenicity; improved; in vivo; Incidence; inhibitor/antagonist; interest; Invaded; JAK2 gene; Janus kinase 2; Kinetics; knock-down; Liver; locked nucleic acid; Lung; malignant breast neoplasm; Malignant neoplasm of brain; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; Metastatic breast cancer; Metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain; Methods; Molecular; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; mouse model; Mutation; nanoparticle; Neoplasm Metastasis; novel; Organ; Outcome; outcome forecast; palliative; Pathway interactions; Patients; personalized medicine; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phosphorylation; Phosphotransferases; Play; Pleura; Pre-Clinical Model; Prevention; prognostic; Prognostic Marker; Relapse; Research; research study; residence; Resistance; response; Risk; Role; screening; Signal Pathway; Site; Slice; Small Interfering RNA; Solid Neoplasm; Stat3 protein; Surveys; System; targeted treatment; Therapeutic Agents; therapeutic target; Time; Tissues; Toxic effect; transcriptome; triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma; Untranslated RNA; Work; Xenograft Model; ","Significance of Inhibiting Long Non-coding RNAs in Advanced Breast Cancer","218025","TPM","Tumor Progression and Metastasis Study Section ","","","01","235066","141039","376105",""

These mutations share the ability to disrupt adrenal cell calcium homeostasis. Herein, we propose to test the hypotheses that mineralocorticoid excess develops as a result of somatic mutations that initially cause renin-independent aldosterone production followed by additional (secondary hit) mutations that increase cell proliferation and lead to tumor development.

Some people recover very well from this disorder, while others do not, and the reason why is unclear. The proposed study will use state-of-the-art brain imaging tools to examine the underlying brain structures important for recovery of language comprehension. We will also focus on the fiber pathways that connect these brain regions to one another, as we have found them to be critical for supporting speech and language functions and expect them to play a key role in recovery, as well.

Moreover, compared to RA in women, RA in men (the demographic most commonly treated in the VA) leads to greater morbidity and worse disease-related outcomes. Previous work from our group has shown that male Veterans with RA experience more than twice the mortality as age-matched men from the general population. Risk factors for RA, including both cigarette smoking and periodontitis (PD), are both highly prevalent in the VA population (the latter affecting ~8 of every 10 U.S. Veterans). Preliminary data suggest that these factors may directly influence the development of autoimmunity in RA. This work will explore the links of between environmental exposures, autoantibody development, and disease progression in RA. Results from this work will lead to an improved understanding of RA risk and may provide insight into new approaches of disease treatment and prevention.","7332065; ","MIKULS, TED RICHARD;","","01/01/2014","12/31/2017","Accounting; adaptive immune response; Address; Affect; Age; Anaerobic Bacteria; Antibodies; Antigens; Arthritis; Autoantibodies; Autoantigens; Autoimmunity; Bacteria; Biological Assay; Biological Availability; Biological Markers; Bone Resorption; Calcium; case control; Case-Control Studies; cigarette smoking; citrullinated protein; Clinical; Clinical Management; cohort; Collagen Type II; Conflict (Psychology); cooperative study; cost; cyclic citrullinated peptide; Data; Degenerative polyarthritis; Development; Diagnostic radiologic examination; differential expression; disability; Disease; Disease Management; Disease Progression; disorder prevention; enolase; Enrollment; Environment; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Impact; Environmental Risk Factor; Enzymes; Etiology; experience; Fibrinogen; Future; General Population; Generations; Healthcare; Immune response; Immune system; Immunity; improved; Infection; Inflammatory Arthritis; insight; Investigation; joint destruction; joint injury; Link; male; Mediating; men; microbial; microbiome; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Nature; novel strategies; oral infection; oral microbiome; Osteoclasts; Outcome; outcome forecast; Pathogenesis; Pathogenicity; pathologic bone resorption; Patients; Peptides; Periodontitis; Phenotype; Play; Population; Porphyromonas gingivalis; Positioning Attribute; Prevalence; Prevention; Probability; programs; Prokaryotic Cells; public health relevance; pyrosequencing; response; Rheumatoid Arthritis; Rheumatoid Factor; Risk; Risk Factors; Role; Sampling; Serum; Shapes; Smoking; Specificity; T cell response; T-Lymphocyte; Testing; Treatment Cost; Veterans; Vimentin; Woman; Work; ","Environmental Factors and Autoantibody Expression in Rheumatoid Arthritis","000896","IMMA","Immunology A ","","","04","","","",""

We have identified a strong association of abnormalities of B-cell phenotype and function with the progression to cirrhosis. This proposal encompasses work to further define the role of viral infection and liver fibrotic stage in driving these abnormalities, to more precisely define how the phenotypic skewing alters B-cell proliferation and survival, and to rescue certain functionality of cirrhotic B-cells in vitro.

Elucidation of the molecular mechanism regulating VEGFA translational readthrough will provide a foundation for investigating mechanisms regulating readthrough of other mRNAs, and can influence our understanding of the factors that regulate blood vessel development in health and disease.","1891116; ","FOX, PAUL L;","BENDER, MICHAEL T.","05/01/2016","04/30/2020","Abbreviations; Acylation; Affinity; Amino Acids; angiogenesis; Antibodies; Bacteria; Base Sequence; Binding; blocking factor; Blood Platelets; blood vessel development; C-terminal; Cell Communication; Cells; cis acting element; Complex; cytokine; Detection; Disease; Elements; Endothelial Cells; Enterochromaffin Cells; Event; exhibitions; Exhibits; experimental study; Foundations; Generations; Genetic Translation; Health; Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein L; Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins; Homeostasis; Human; Hydroxyl Radical; In Vitro; in vivo; Investigation; Lead; Malignant Neoplasms; Mass Spectrum Analysis; Messenger RNA; Mitogens; Modeling; Molecular; Multiprotein Complexes; Mus; Mutation Analysis; Myoblasts; novel; novel strategies; Nuclear; Nucleoproteins; Peptides; polypeptide; Post-Translational Protein Processing; prevent; Primer Extension; Production; Property; Protein Isoforms; Proteins; Proteome; public health relevance; Regulation; Regulator Genes; release factor; Reporter; Reporting; ribosome profiling; ribosome releasing factor; Ribosomes; RNA; RNA Sequences; Role; Serine; Shapes; stem; Structure; System; Terminator Codon; Testing; Trans-Activators; Transfer RNA; Translations; tumor growth; Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors; VEGFA gene; Virus; Xenograft procedure; Yeasts; ","Mechanisms and Regulation of Programmed Translational Readthrough","115476","MGB","Molecular Genetics B Study Section ","","","02","190000","111150","301150",""

Robust collateral flow improves the chance of good outcome in endovascular stroke therapy and decreases the risk of intracranial bleeding. Despite this, there has yet to be a prospective study of collateral flow in acute stroke patients. The goal of the imaging of Collaterals in Acute Stroke (iCAS) study is to determine how to incorporate MRI-based collateral perfusion assessment using a non-contrast perfusion method, arterial spin labeling (ASL), into patient-selection algorithms for endovascular stroke therapy. In our prior funding cycle, we successfully showed that ASL can effectively detect collaterals and determine the cerebral blood flow (CBF) they provide in patients with Moyamoya disease, a vasculopathy of young people who develop extensive collateral networks. Based on this, we are ready to apply these techniques to the larger population of acute stroke patients. We will build on the recently completed, successful DEFUSE-2 trial by adding two short ASL sequences to the acute stroke assessment, one to assess collaterals (pseudocontinuous ASL) and the other to measure quantitative CBF (velocity-selective ASL). To this end, we will perform the first multi-center ASL trial in 180 acute stroke patients, who will undergo serial MR imaging and clinical follow-up. Our aims address (1) the accuracy of ASL methods for assessing collaterals and (2) the ability of early ASL collateral imaging to predict infarct lesion growth and good clinical outcome. We will specifically determine how to integrate information about collaterals into patient triage strategie to obtain the best possible outcomes. Such information will have importance beyond endovascular therapy, and could impact decision- making on the use of intravenous tPA both within and beyond current standard time windows. Successful completion of the iCAS study will lead to better understanding of the role of collaterals in acute stroke patients. Furthermore, imaging quantitative CBF at multiple time points will better elucidate the physiology underlying tissue infarction in patients with both successful and unsuccessful stroke therapy. In summary, the findings from this study will markedly enhance our understanding of collaterals and their physiological impact in the ischemic brain, and enhance already significant diagnostic power of MRI in acute ischemic stroke.","9633712; ","ZAHARCHUK, GREGORY GEORGE;","KOENIG, JAMES I","08/05/2009","05/31/2018","Acute; acute stroke; Address; Affect; Algorithms; Blood flow; blood flow measurement; Blood Flow Velocity; Bolus Infusion; Brain; Bypass; Cerebral Angiography; Cerebrovascular Circulation; Cerebrovascular Disorders; Clinical; clinical imaging; Coagulation Process; cohort; cost; Cyclization; Decision Making; Diagnostic; Diffusion; digital; Digital Subtraction Angiography; Early treatment; Failure; follow-up; forest; Funding; Goals; Grant; Growth; hemodynamics; Hemorrhage; Hospitals; Image; Imagery; imaging study; improved; Infarction; International; Intravenous; ischemic lesion; Ischemic Stroke; Kidney Failure; Label; Lesion; Link; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Measurement; Measures; Medical center; meetings; Methods; Modality; Moyamoya Disease; Multicenter Studies; non-invasive imaging; novel; Outcome; Outcome Measure; Patient Schedules; Patient Selection; Patient Triage; Patient-Focused Outcomes; Patients; Peer Review; Perfusion; Physiological; Physiology; Play; Population; prospective; Prospective cohort; Prospective Studies; Protocols documentation; public health relevance; Publishing; quantitative imaging; Recruitment Activity; Reference Standards; Reperfusion Therapy; Reproducibility; Risk; Role; Route; S-Adenosylmethionine; Selection Criteria; Sensitivity and Specificity; Severities; Site; Spin Labels; stroke; stroke therapy; success; Techniques; Testing; Thrombolytic Therapy; Time; Tissue Viability; Tissues; United States National Institutes of Health; Universities; Variant; Vascular blood supply; Vascular Diseases; Xenon; ","Imaging Collaterals in Acute Stroke (iCAS)","066506","ANIE","Acute Neural Injury and Epilepsy Study Section ","","","08","423216","168885","592101",""

It remains the 10th leading cause of mortality worldwide despite the availability of an effective vaccine. Many viral and host factors have been examined to elucidate the disease progression and complications but they remain incompletely understood. Currently, seven agents are FDA-approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. Each of these agents was reported to have benefits for patients by preventing disease progression. However, none of these agents, used as monotherapy, can definitively eradicate HBV. The Harvard Hepatitis B Consortium was selected as one of the Clinical Centers of the NIDDK-sponsored Hepatitis B Research Network (HBRN) in North America. We have been working collaboratively with the other 11 clinical centers, the Data Coordinating Center (DCC), and the Immunology Center within the HBRN to understand the natural history and disease mechanisms of HBV. In addition, there are two clinical trials designed to evaluate the efficacy of combination therapy with pegylated interferon and an antiviral agent in HBsAg clearance, the ultimate goal to control HBV. Both trials are actively enrolling patients. Collectively, the long term patient observation, the ancillary scientific studies and the clinical trial results generated by the HBRN will undoubtedly yield valuable insights into the natural history and optimal therapy for this important disease.","1936402; 6774896 (contact); ","CHUNG, RAYMOND T; LAU, DARYL T (contact);","DOO, EDWARD ","09/30/2008","05/31/2020","Address; Adult; Affect; Ancillary Study; Antiviral Agents; Biochemical; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell Line; Cell model; Chronic Hepatitis B; Clinical; Clinical Data; clinical phenotype; Clinical Trials; Clinical Trials Design; cohort; Cohort Studies; Combined Modality Therapy; Competence; Data; Data Coordinating Center; Databases; Disease; disease natural history; Disease Progression; Enrollment; ethnic diversity; Evolution; FDA approved; fitness; follow-up; Goals; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis B e Antigens; Hepatitis B Surface Antigens; Hepatitis B Virus; Hepatocarcinogenesis; High Prevalence; Histologic; Immune; Immunology; immunopathology; In Vitro; insight; Integration Host Factors; Interferons; Lead; Liver Failure; Malignant neoplasm of liver; Mission; Modeling; Molecular; Molecular Structure; Monitor; mortality; Mutation; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases; Natural History; North America; Pathogenesis; Patient observation; Patient Recruitments; Patients; polypeptide; Predisposition; prevent; promoter; Public Health; public health relevance; Relapse; Reporting; repository; Request for Applications; Research; retention rate; Role; Site; Taurocholate Sodium; therapy outcome; treatment responders; treatment response; U-Series Cooperative Agreements; Vaccines; Variant; Viral; Virion; virology; ","Harvard Hepatitis B Consortium","082919","ZDK1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","10","302029","126316","353345",""

Veterans with ALS suffer from severe muscle wasting/weakness and eventually die from respiratory failure. One consistent neuropathological feature in ALS is the presence of misfolded proteins in the spinal motor neurons, which activates irreversible cell death mechanism leading to neurodegeneration.

Every aspect of medical care in the VA medical system is affected by its common presence. A condition in which the heart is no longer in regular rhythm, atrial fibrillation, occurs frequently (4% of thoseof 60 years old and 9% in those over 80); it is the most common arrhythmia in the United States, including veterans. Atrial fibrillation is associated with high risks of stroke and death, yet causs of this widespread problem are not well understood. This study aims to find a connection between common factors which are associated with high blood pressure and heart disease (angiotensin and renin), and a newly related factor (chymase) with the common arrhythmia atrial fibrillation. Furthermore, the function of the heart will be evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to show the effects that chymase has on contractility and ejection of both the upper and lower chambers of the heart. This will allow for directed treatments to facilitate alleviation of atrial fibrillation.","1882765; ","DELL'ITALIA, LOUIS J.;","","01/01/2014","12/31/2017","Achievement; Acute; Affect; American; Angiotensin I; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Angiotensins; Anti-Arrhythmia Agents; Arrhythmia; Atrial Fibrillation; Cardiac; Cardiac Myocytes; Cardiac Surgery procedures; Cardiopulmonary Bypass; Cause of Death; Cell Communication; Cells; Cessation of life; Chymase; Cine Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Clinical Trials; Confocal Microscopy; connexin 40; Connexins; Data; efficacy testing; EFRAC; Failure; Fibrosis; Functional disorder; Gap Junctions; Gelatinase B; Heart; Heart Atrium; Heart Diseases; heart function; high risk; Hour; Human; Hydrolysis; Hypertension; Hypoxia; Immunohistochemistry; In Vitro; Incidence; inhibitor/antagonist; insight; interstitial; Ischemia; Left; Left atrial structure; Liquid substance; Location; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; mast cell; Matrix Metalloproteinases; Measurement; Mediating; Medical; Metabolism; Mitral Valve; Mitral Valve Insufficiency; MME gene; Monitor; Muscle Cells; novel strategies; Operative Surgical Procedures; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pericardial body location; Pericardial sac structure; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Postoperative Period; Prevention; Procedures; public health relevance; receptor; Recruitment Activity; Renin; repaired; Reperfusion Injury; Reperfusion Therapy; Research; Rodent; Stretching; stroke; success; System; Testing; Three-dimensional analysis; Time; Tissues; Transplantation; United States; Ventricular; Veterans; ","The Chymase Angiotensin-(1-12) Axis in Heart Disease","000993","CARA","Cardiovascular Studies A ","","","04","","","",""

Two of the leading causes of VI, refractive error and cataract, are substantially influenced by genetic factors which may account for as much as 94% and 78% of the variation in respective disease risk. The identification of genes influencing common ocular ailments as well as normal ocular biology will provide valuable insights into their (patho)biology. In this project, we focus on the identification of rare, functional genetic variants influencing normal and disrupted visual mechanisms, using a powerful exome sequencing approach in a large extended pedigree from the Jirel population of eastern Nepal. Such an approach will allow us to identify rare coding variants of large effect sizes, and thereby gain insight into the geneti mechanisms influencing normal and disease-state ocular biology. The results of this project will aid in the identification of new treatments preventions and refinement of existing approaches to management of ocular disease.","9801982 (contact); 1884146; ","JOHNSON, MATTHEW P (contact); WILLIAMS-BLANGERO, SARAH A.;","BHARGAVA, SANGEETA ","12/01/2015","05/31/2019","Address; Age; aged; Aging; Biology; Biomedical Research; Biometry; blind; Blindness; Candidate Disease Gene; Catalogs; Cataract; Code; cohort; Collaborations; Collection; Complex; Contracts; cost; cost effective; Data; density; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Disease; disease phenotype; disorder risk; Economic Burden; Elderly; Epidemiologist; Epidemiology; Ethnic group; exome sequencing; experience; Eye; Eye diseases; Family; Genealogy; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Determinism; genetic epidemiology; genetic information; genetic pedigree; Genetic Research; Genetic Risk; Genetic study; genetic variant; genome-wide; Genomic Segment; Geography; Growth and Development function; Health; health care availability; Healthcare; Heritability; Home environment; Human; Inbreeding; Individual; Industrialization; Infection; insight; Institutes; Joints; Measures; Medical; member; Mental Depression; Molecular; mortality; Nepal; novel; novel strategies; Ophthalmic examination and evaluation; Ophthalmologist; Ophthalmology; Personal Satisfaction; Phenotype; pleiotropism; Population; population based; Prevalence; Prevention; Procedures; programs; Property; prospective; Proteins; Public Health; public health relevance; Quality of life; Quantitative Trait Loci; rare variant; Recruitment Activity; Refractive Errors; Research; Research Design; Research Infrastructure; Research Institute; Research Personnel; Resources; Role; rural area; Signal Transduction; Site; SNP genotyping; Societies; sociologist; Solid; Surveys; Susceptibility Gene; targeted treatment; Testing; Texas; Time; trait; Variant; Vision; Visual; Visual impairment; ","Genetic Epidemiology of Ocular Health and Disease","024384","ZEY1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","05","527752","136211","663963",""

Tumor cells also use these lipids as building blocks for many of the key molecular signals needed for tumor growth. Thus, cancer cells rely heavily on lipogenesis to drive their growth, but currently, there are major gaps in our knowledge about how cancer causing mutations control the synthesis of specific lipids to cause tumor growth and drug resistance. Through studies supported by the first 5 years of this RO1, we have identified critical signaling molecules that are hyper-activated in the highly lethal brain cancer glioblastoma, and demonstrated that they potently stimulate tumor growth and resistance to almost all current treatments by reprogramming the metabolism of tumor cells. We present exciting preliminary data to suggest that one of these key signaling complexes, mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), promotes glioblastoma development and progression by controlling a set of enzymes that regulate the synthesis of a discrete set of specific lipids that are required for tumor growth. However, before these mechanisms can be applied to inform the development of new therapies, a number of urgent questions must be answered. How does mTORC2 regulate glioblastoma nutrient uptake and utilization and shift it towards the synthesis of specific lipids in cancer cells? What are the signaling, biochemical and transcriptional mechanisms and how do they drive tumor growth and drug resistance? Are they druggable? The overall goals of this research are to: 1) provide a deeper understanding of altered lipid metabolism in glioblastoma and to delineate mTORC2's role in regulating it; 2) identify the specific lipids that promote tumor growth and the specific enzymes that regulate this process, and 3) identify and develop brain- penetrant drugs to target these specific pathways that are altered in cancer. The overall goal of the proposed studies is to provide a deeper understanding of altered lipid metabolism in cancer and to develop more effective treatments for patients with glioblastoma.","1959652; ","MISCHEL, PAUL S;","FOUNTAIN, JANE W.","06/15/2011","05/31/2021","Acetates; Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase; Acetylation; Acyltransferase; ATP Citrate (pro-S)-Lyase; Automobile Driving; Bioavailable; Biochemical; Brain; cancer cell; Cancer Etiology; cell growth; Cells; Ceramides; Chemicals; Complex; Data; design; Development; Drug Kinetics; Drug resistance; Drug Targeting; effective therapy; Enzymes; experimental study; Fatty Acids; Fatty-acid synthase; fluorescence molecular tomography; Formulation; FRAP1 gene; Genetic; Genetic Transcription; genome editing; Glioblastoma; Glucocorticoids; Glucose; Glutamine; Goals; Grant; Growth; Growth Factor Receptors; Histone Deacetylase; Image; Implant; in vivo; inhibitor/antagonist; Injectable; Intravenous; knock-down; Knowledge; Label; lipid biosynthesis; lipid metabolism; Lipid Synthesis Pathway; Lipids; Liquid Chromatography; Malignant neoplasm of brain; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediator of activation protein; Membrane; membrane biogenesis; Membrane Lipids; Metabolic; Metabolic Pathway; Metabolism; Modeling; Molecular; Mus; Mutation; neoplastic cell; novel therapeutics; Nutrient; Oncogenic; Oral; overexpression; Palmitates; parallelization; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phospholipids; Phosphorylation; Phosphotransferases; Plasma; Process; Property; Proteins; Receptor Signaling; Research; Resistance; Role; Serum; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Signaling Molecule; site-1 protease; small molecule; Specific qualifier value; Sphingolipids; tandem mass spectrometry; Testing; Therapeutic; transcription factor; tumor; tumor growth; tumor metabolism; uptake; ","The role of mTORC2 in reprogramming cancer cell metabolism","073831","TCB","Tumor Cell Biology Study Section ","","","08","218750","123724","342474",""

SCD patients suffer from a prothrombogenic phenotype with excess clot formation and thrombosis, leading to serious consequences such as ischemic stroke. Markers of neutrophil activity have revealed that circulating neutrophils of SCD patients are activated and as such this has provided indirect evidence for their implication in thrombosis. In the proposed studies we will investigate ways in which neutrophils contribute directly to cerebral thrombosis, something that is currently unknown and has never been investigated. We strongly believe that by understanding ways that neutrophils contribute not only to the systemic prothrombogenic phenotype of SCD, but more specifically to the actual local thrombus formation, we will uncover the potential implication of targeting neutrophils as a therapeutic strategy for this debilitating and life threatening disease.","12102539; ","GAVINS, FELICITY NICOLA EMMA;","LERNER, NORMA B","06/17/2017","04/30/2021","Address; Adult; Affect; Age; Amino Acid Substitution; Animal Model; arteriole; Biological Markers; Blood Cells; Blood Coagulation Disorders; Blood Platelets; Blood Vessels; Brain; Cause of Death; Cell Adhesion; Cerebral Infarction; cerebral microvasculature; Cerebral Thrombosis; Cerebrovascular Disorders; Cerebrovascular system; Cerebrum; Child; Chronic; citrate carrier; Clinical; Coagulants; Coagulation Process; Comorbidity; congenital heart disorder; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; Disease; Endothelial Cells; Erythrocytes; extracellular; Functional disorder; Generations; Gold; Hemoglobin; Hereditary Disease; Histones; Hypertension; Impairment; Individual; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Ischemic Stroke; Leukocytes; Life; Link; Lung; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Mediating; Modeling; Molecular; mortality; mouse model; Multicellular Process; Mus; mutant; Neurologic Signs; neutrophil; Nuclear; Obesity; Organ; Pathway interactions; Patients; Phenotype; Platelet Activation; Platelet aggregation; Play; Production; Protein C; Reactive Oxygen Species; response; Risk Factors; Role; Sickle Cell; Sickle Cell Anemia; Stimulus; stroke; Testing; Therapeutic; Thrombin; Thrombophilia; Thromboplastin; Thrombosis; Thrombus; Tissues; venule; White Blood Cell Count procedure; ","Investigating the dysfunction of the cerebral microvasculature in sickle cell disease","134959","HM","Hypertension and Microcirculation Study Section ","","A1","01","250000","112500","362500",""

Symptoms of these problems do not respond effectively to available medications, and there are no approaches to slowing or preventing their development. A major limitation to discovery of new treatment approaches is the underlying complexity of brain pathology in PD with dementia subjects. Individual patients may have various combinations of abnormal protein depositions, including proteins called alpha-synuclein, beta-amyloid, and tau. These proteins are potentially hallmarks of differing pathways and types of brain injury, and are unlikely all to respond to the same type of treatment intervention. Thus, progress in the field of PD with dementia will require methods to identify involved pathways and protein depositions in individual patients. In the present research proposal, we will apply recently-developed research brain imaging methods that can reveal the major degenerating pathways and protein accumulations in PD with dementia. We will evaluate whether this approach results in differing types of symptoms or of symptom progression in individual patients, depending on their imaging results. Ultimately, we expect this brain imaging approach will permit the future design and testing of new specifically-targeted treatments to slow or halt the development of dementia in PD patients.","1862775; ","FREY, KIRK A.;","BABCOCK, DEBRA J.","09/25/2016","05/31/2021","abeta deposition; Affect; alpha synuclein; Alzheimer's Disease; Amyloid; Amyloid beta-Protein; Amyloid deposition; amyloid peptide; Attentional deficit; Autopsy; Binding; Biological Markers; Brain; Brain imaging; Brain Injuries; Brain Pathology; brain research; Cells; Characteristics; Classification; Clinical; clinical Diagnosis; clinically significant; Cognitive; cognitive change; Cognitive deficits; Corpus striatum structure; Dementia; Deposition; design; Deterioration; Development; dihydrotetrabenazine; disability; Disease; dopaminergic neuron; effective therapy; endophenotype; exhibitions; Exhibits; extracellular; Failure; follow-up; Frequencies; Future; Goals; Image; imaging approach; imaging biomarker; imaging modality; Impaired cognition; Individual; individual patient; Intervention; Label; Lead; Lewy Bodies; Lewy Body Dementia; Memory; Memory impairment; mental function; Methods; Modification; Molecular; molecular imaging; Movement Disorders; Natural History; neocortical; Nerve Degeneration; Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1; Neurites; Neurofibrillary Tangles; Neurons; neuropathology; novel therapeutic intervention; paired helical filament; Parkinson Disease; Parkinson's Dementia; Parkinsonian Disorders; Pathologic; Pathology; Pathway interactions; patient subsets; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phenotype; phosphoneuroprotein 14; Pittsburgh Compound-B; Positron-Emission Tomography; Presynaptic Terminals; prevent; protein aggregate; Proteins; Recruitment Activity; Research Proposals; S-Adenosylmethionine; Senile Plaques; Severities; Source; Stratification; Symptoms; Syndrome; synucleinopathy; tau aggregation; tau Proteins; Testing; Therapeutic Trials; Tracer; trait; virtual; ","Lewy Body Dementia Biomarkers","100611","ZNS1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","685130","371399","1056529",""

The primary objective of this proposal is to establish and test a graft- targeted immunomodulatory protocol delivered using advanced biomaterials that sustains long-term islet graft survival and function in the absence of any immunosuppression in various relevant pre-clinical models, including a humanized mouse model.

Unfortunately, aggressive screening over the last 25 years has led to detection of many small, early stage prostate lesions not destined to progress or kill men. However, physicians lack tools to distinguish early lesions that are aggressive from those that are indolent. We propose to characterize early prostate cancers and their precursor lesions for genomic and proteomic changes and use these data to construct evolutionary trees. From this we intend to identify clinically useful changes that could be used to distinguish indolent ('dead-end') lesions from those that are potentially aggressive.","1889210; ","BROOKS, JAMES D.;","WOODHOUSE, ELIZABETH ","09/16/2015","08/31/2020","Address; adverse outcome; Basement membrane; Biological; Biological Markers; Biology; Biopsy; body system; Cancer Patient; candidate marker; Carcinoma; Cell Lineage; Cells; Clinical; clinical effect; Clinical Trials; clinically relevant; clinically significant; cohort; Data; Death Rate; Detection; Development; Diagnosis; DNA copy number; DNA Sequence Alteration; Drops; Early treatment; Epithelial; Event; Evolution; Financial cost; Formalin; Freezing; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profiling; Genetic Transcription; Genomics; Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer; Glycoproteins; glycoproteomics; Growth; Hereditary Disease; Heterogeneity; Histologic; Histology; improved; Indolent; Intraepithelial Neoplasia; Killings; Laboratories; Lesion; Malignant neoplasm of prostate; Malignant Neoplasms; men; Molecular; Molecular Genetics; Morbidity - disease rate; Morphology; Nature; Neoplastic Epithelial Cell; Organ; Outcome; Ovary; Paraffin Embedding; Pathway interactions; Patient-Focused Outcomes; Patients; Phenotype; Phylogenetic Analysis; Phylogeny; Physicians; prognostic; Prostate; prostate carcinogenesis; Prostate-Specific Antigen; Prostatic Neoplasms; protein expression; Protein Glycosylation; Proteins; Proteome; Proteomics; PSA level; public health relevance; Radical Prostatectomy; Recurrence; S-Adenosylmethionine; Sampling; screening; Sensitivity and Specificity; Serum; Specimen; success; Technology; Testing; Tissue Embedding; Tissues; tool; Transcript; transcriptome; Trees; tumor; Uncertainty; ","Stanford Molecular and Cellular Characterization Laboratory","196387","ZCA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","S1","02","50000","28500","78500",""

BCG vaccine derived from Mycobacterium bovis is the only approved human vaccine although, it has a partial efficacy against childhood and adult tuberculosis. There is a need understand the immune responses in human neonates to determine if better more efficient tuberculosis vaccines can be developed against tuberculosis which protects lifelong. Regrettably, most animal models generate data which may poorly correlate with human neonatal immunity. We have developed a neonatal monkey model, whose immune system is very close to that of humans. This project will therefore use the neonatal monkey to compare a new candidate vaccine with the approved BCG vaccine to determine if better and long lasting immunity can be induced against human tuberculosis. Thus, this study will directly impact the public health helping to prevent disease due to tuberculosis.

Nearly 50% of GVs seek VA clinical care, and nearly 40% receive disability compensation. To date, the causes of these symptoms are not known, and as a result, no efficacious treatments are available. The proposed research addresses this problem by testing multiple physiological systems at rest and in response to exercise in GVs with Gulf War Illness (GWI). These studies will determine whether interactions among central nervous, autonomic, and immune systems explain symptoms at baseline and the worsening of symptoms that occur following exercise challenge (i.e., post-exertion malaise). Results from this research are intended to improve our understanding of the causes of GWI and to begin a path towards individualized treatment of this debilitating condition. These goals are directly in-line with the mission of the Department of Veterans Affairs to care for those who have served this country.","7726338 (contact); 8699275; ","COOK, DANE B.

COPD is a chronic disease that generates significant health care costs to the Veterans Affairs Health Care System. Unfortunately, the clinical course of this lung disorder is difficult to predict and poorly understood. Our results may determine key features that differentiate the upper airway and lung microbiota of patients with frequent COPD exacerbations from those who experience less frequent COPD exacerbations. We may identify new targets for COPD treatment by identifying two new mechanisms of COPD progression: 1) aspiration of oral bacteria and 2) emergence of specific bacteria in the lung microbiota.

At the time of diagnosis, less than 10% of women are presented with a metastatic disease. However, when relapse occurs after definitive therapy, the majority of patients end up with disseminated metastases rather than an isolated local recurrence. Given the vexing problem of drug resistance as outlined above, simultaneous delivery of combination therapy is critical in circumventing drug resistance for the treatment of HER-2-positive breast cancers. However, the ability to safely and specifically deliver multiple drugs with non-overlapping mechanisms of action has been challenging. The reason is that invariably, overlapping toxicities are also present, as evidenced by cardiac toxicity with adriamycin and trastuzumab, and GI and skin toxicities with capacitabine and lapatinib. To overcome these issues, we plan to develop multifunctional polymeric nanoparticles to test the hypothesis that tri-modal combination nanoparticles will prove more effective with less toxicity than current standard of care therapies for HER-2 positive breast cancers. These multi-functional polymeric nanoparticles will incorporate paclitaxel (Taxol) and 17-AAG within the core, but will also be 'decorated' on the surface with trastuzumab as a targeting moiety to specifically target HER-2 receptors and will also serve as a molecular targeted therapeutic agent. We hypothesize that these targeted nanoparticles will be active in vitro against HER-2 positive breast cancer cell lines as well as HER-2 positive trastuzumab and/or lapatinib resistant breast cancer cell lines, and that they will show in vivo efficacy in mouse xenograft models of HER-2 positive drug resistant tumors. This work will, when successfully completed, bring to bear the combined power of a chemotherapeutic agent, molecular targeted therapy and HSP90 inhibitor, to overcome HER-2 resistance with minimal toxicity.","6709778; ","AKALA, EMMANUEL O;","CHUNG, DAVYD W","05/01/2015","04/30/2018","Adriamycin PFS; Biodistribution; Breast Cancer Cell; Breast Cancer cell line; Breast Cancer Treatment; Cancer Etiology; Cardiotoxicity; Cessation of life; chemotherapeutic agent; chemotherapy; Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials; combat; Combined Modality Therapy; Confocal Microscopy; crosslink; cytotoxicity; Diagnosis; Disease; docetaxel; drug efficacy; Drug resistance; Dyes; efficacy study; ERBB2 gene; Feedback; Fluorescent Dyes; Heat-Shock Proteins 90; HSP 90 inhibition; In Vitro; in vivo; inhibitor/antagonist; Kinetics; Label; lapatinib; malignant breast neoplasm; Malignant neoplasm of lung; Malignant neoplasm of ovary; Malignant neoplasm of prostate; Malignant Neoplasms; Modality; Molecular Target; molecular targeted therapies; multimodality; Mus; nanoparticle; Nanotechnology; Neoplasm Metastasis; novel; Oncogenic; Outcome; Paclitaxel; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase; Phase III Clinical Trials; Polymers; public health relevance; receptor; Recurrence; Regimen; Relapse; Resistance; resistance mutation; response; Rhodamine 123; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Skin; standard of care; Surface; targeted agent; targeted treatment; taxane; Testing; Therapeutic; therapy resistant; Time; Toxic effect; Trastuzumab; Treatment Efficacy; tumor; uptake; Ursidae Family; Variant; Woman; Work; Xenograft Model; ","Novel Nanotechnology Platform for Breast Cancer Treatment","199810","ZGM1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","03","18066","9214","27280",""

The studies proposed in this application will elucidate the mechanisms by which these signaling pathways interact to achieve cell survival and differentiation, which are key pathways disrupted in oncogenesis.

Using advanced methods for intracranial EEG data co-registration and analysis, we will generate a model of the network behavior that enables us to read letters, words and derive meaning from sentences. Lastly, we will deliver carefully timed electrical pulses to perturb the network and test our hypotheses about the networks of language in the human brain- all of which will yield novel insights into language organization - applicable to normal language capacity and language dysfunction in a wide variety of patients with neurologic and psychiatric illnesses.","1882601; 9016383 (contact); ","CRONE, NATHAN E; TANDON, NITIN  (contact);","GNADT, JAMES W","09/25/2016","05/31/2019","Anatomy; Area; Auditory; Behavior; Biological Models; Biological Neural Networks; Brain; Cognitive; cognitive load; cognitive process; cognitive task; cohort; Collaborations; Complex; computer framework; Cues; Data; data modeling; Data Set; Databases; Descriptor; Development; Dimensions; Electrodes; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology (science); Epilepsy; experimental study; Feedback; Frequencies; Functional disorder; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Goals; Human; improved; indexing; Individual; information processing; innovation; insight; Institutionalization; Intervention; Language; language processing; Lateral; Letters; lexical; Linguistics; Lobar; Measures; Medical center; Mental disorders; Methods; Modality; Modeling; Motor; motor control; Motor Cortex; Names; network models; neural model; Neurologic; novel; Orthography; Output; Pathologic; Patients; Pattern; pattern perception; Pattern Recognition; phonology; Physiologic pulse; Physiological; Play; Population Analysis; Process; programs; Reading; Recruitment Activity; relating to nervous system; Resolution; response; Role; Sampling; semantic processing; signal processing; Signal Transduction; Site; Speech; Stream; Structure; syntax; System; Techniques; Temporal Lobe; temporal measurement; Testing; Texas; Visual; Visual Pattern Recognition; Visual Perception; Work; ","A unified cognitive network model of language","098981","ZNS1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","840470","155790","996260",""

The proposed research will identify novel and conserved molecules that are critical for learning and memory formation and the decline of these processes with age, and may lead to therapies to improve or maintain cognitive abilities with age.","11444057; ","AREY, RACHEL NICOLE;","WAGSTER, MOLLY V.","03/15/2015","03/14/2018","Address; Adult; Age; age effect; Age-associated memory impairment; aged; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease; BAIAP1 gene; Behavior Control; Bioinformatics; Biological Assay; Brain; Brain region; Caenorhabditis elegans; Candidate Disease Gene; Cells; Chemotaxis; classical conditioning; cognitive ability; Complex; CREB1 gene; CRF receptor type 1; Cytolysis; Defect; density; Deterioration; Disadvantaged; Disease; experimental study; Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting; Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization; Genes; Genetic Transcription; Hippocampus (Brain); Homologous Gene; improved; Individual; insight; interest; Label; Lead; Learning; long term memory; Mammals; Memory; Memory impairment; Messenger RNA; Molecular; Nematoda; Nervous system structure; Neuronal Plasticity; Neurons; novel; Organism; Performance; Population; postsynaptic; Process; Proteins; public health relevance; receptor; Regulation; Research; RNA; RNA analysis; RNA Interference; RNA-Binding Proteins; Role; scaffold; Scaffolding Protein; Short-Term Memory; single molecule; Structure; Synapses; Techniques; Training; Transcript; transcription factor; transcriptome; transcriptome sequencing; Translating; Translations; ","Identifying postsynaptic regulators of long-term memory in Caenorhabditis elegans","046106","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","S1","02","277","","277",""
