We and others have identified subsets of severe and exacerbation prone asthma patients (endotypes) for whom there are treatable mechanisms contributing to airflow obstruction. We have also developed biomarkers that will likely predict response to therapy targeted specifically to each endotype. These are 1) urinary bromotyrosine to identify the 70% of eosinophilic patients for whom ant-IL5 will be effective; 2) serum superoxide dismutase activity to identify patients who will respond to oral Coenzyme Q; and 3) serum dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) sulfate to identify patients who will respond to oral DHEA. We propose to use an adaptive trial design to test and improve the predictive and response biomarkers for all three endotypes. To accomplish these Aims, we plan to participate in the PrecISE network, enrolling 100 subjects with severe and/or exacerbation prone asthma.

In the US, 18 million Americans abuse alcohol, with alcoholic liver disease affecting over 10 million people. Alcohol abuse's deleterious effects on the liver leads to pathologically distinct entities: steatosis, steatohepatitis (ASH), fibrosis and cirrhosis. Disease progression only occurs in a sub-set of heavy drinkers, suggesting a role for genetic and environmental risk factors. There is a pressing clinical need to develop improved therapies for patients with ASH, as the current strategy of glucocorticoid (GC) treatment is only effective in a sub-set of patients. Here we propose to combine our experimental and analytical resources with the ongoing ASH UO1 Clinical and Translational studies to identify novel genetic contributions to ASH. We will leverage the technical expertise of the Laboratory for Neuro Genetics at NIAAA to carry out whole exome sequencing of DNA collected from patients with ASH and heavy drinking controls without liver disease. We propose to conduct novel, state of the art analysis of the DNA data, integrating the unique compendium of phenotypic data on this large cohort of patients with AH and heavy drinkers without disease. We will make use of state of the art bioinformatics, including rare variant analysis, analysis of tracts of homozygosity and gene/environment interactions, to identify the genetic underpinnings for the risk for:1) Susceptibility to severe alcoholic hepatitis, 2) Risk for early mortality from AH, 3) Response to therapy and 4) Alcohol Recidivism. In summary, the combination of our well- characterized unique population of heavy drinkers with and without AH with our bioinformatics expertise will enable our consortium to identify key genetic determinants for determining risk for and survival after AH.","11253392; 1866065 (contact); ","BATALLER, RAMON ; NAGY, LAURA E.

Transgender persons have the highest HIV incidence of any risk group, and discrepancies between self-reported prevalence and HIV testing data indicate that many HIV-infected transgender women are not aware of their HIV status. The U.S. National HIV/AIDS Strategy notes that transgender persons are at high risk for HIV infection and yet efforts specifically targeting transgender populations have been minimal. To date there are no evidence- based HIV prevention programs that have been developed for and evaluated with this population. To fill this unmet need this project will develop a mobile app delivered multimedia interactive HIV prevention and sexual health promotion program developed for transgender women that delivers the intervention as a series of interactive activities tailored to the user. All activities will include gender affirmation and opportunities for social support. When complete, the resulting product will provide a cost effective HIV/STI intervention that can be implemented with transgender women across diverse settings with fidelity, while increasing uptake and effective delivery by appealing to the target audience on their mobile device and ultimately reducing new HIV/STI infections among transgender women.","1961166; 8712017 (contact); 10287278; ","KLEIN, CHARLES HOWARD; KUHN, TAMARA J (contact); SUN, CHRISTINA JIAYI;","ALVIDREZ, JENNIFER L","09/21/2017","08/31/2018","Address; Adult; AIDS prevention; AIDS/HIV problem; Alcohol consumption; Architecture; Attitude; base; Birth; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.); cisgender; Client; Color; Communities; community organizations; condoms; cost; cost effective; Couples; Data; design; Development; Disadvantaged; Discrimination; Drug usage; Educational Curriculum; Effectiveness; Elements; Employment; Epidemic; Evaluation; evidence base; Evidence based program; expectation; experience; Face; Federal Government; Female; Fostering; Gender; Gender Identity; gender transition; General Population; handheld mobile device; Harm Reduction; Health; health care availability; health care service; health disparity; health organization; Health Promotion; Health Services Accessibility; Healthcare; high risk; Hispanics; HIV; HIV Infections; HIV risk; HIV/STD; HIV/STI intervention; Homicide; Hormonal; hormone therapy; Human immunodeficiency virus test; improved; Incidence; Individual; Infection; Institutes; interactive multimedia; interest; International; Intervention; Knowledge; Lead; Life; Life Cycle Stages; Location; male; men who have sex with men; Mental Depression; Mental Health; mHealth; minority health; mobile application; mobile computing; Operative Surgical Procedures; Outcome; Participant; Patient Self-Report; Persons; Phase; Phonation; physical abuse; Population; Population Research; Poverty; pre-exposure prophylaxis; Prevalence; Prevention; Prevention program; Privatization; Procedures; programs; Prostitution; prototype; Provider; Public Health; Publishing; Randomized Controlled Trials; Reporting; Research; Research Infrastructure; Research Personnel; Research Project Grants; resilience; response; Risk; rural area; Series; sex; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Sexual Health; Sexual Partners; Site; skills; Small Business Innovation Research Grant; social cognitive theory; Social Network; Social support; Social Work; Technology; Telephone; Testing; Time; transgender; transgender women; transphobia; United States; Universities; uptake; usability; Verbally abusive behavior; Violence; Woman; ","Transwomen Connected, a mobile app delivered HIV prevention program","012279","ZMD1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","","","224972",""

Corticosteroids are not currently routinely used to treat dyspnea, despite strong theoretical and empirical support, and available treatments for dyspnea are lacking. This project is relevant to the NIH's mission because effective management of dyspnea may ultimately help improve function and quality of life for cancer patients suffering from this devastating symptom, and a better understanding of how corticosteroids affect dyspnea will help us to devise newer, more effective treatments for this debilitating condition.","11611025; ","HUI, DAVID ;","O'MARA, ANN M","09/21/2017","08/31/2021","Achievement; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Advanced Malignant Neoplasm; Adverse effects; Affect; Anorexia; arm; associated symptom; base; Biological Markers; Cachexia; Cancer Patient; Case Series; Characteristics; chemotherapy; Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease; clinical effect; Clinical Trials; Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events; Consent; Data; Dexamethasone; Distress; Dose; Double-Blind Method; Dyspnea; Dyspnea Management; effective therapy; Esthesia; evidence base; Fatigue; Functional disorder; Goals; health related quality of life; Hematologic Neoplasms; IL8 gene; Impairment; improved; improved functioning; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Inflammatory Response; innovation; instrument; Interleukin-1 beta; Interleukin-10; Interleukin-6; Interleukins; Lung diseases; Malignant Neoplasms; Metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain; Mission; Nausea and Vomiting; novel; novel therapeutics; Numeric Rating Scale; oncology; Opioid; Outcome; Outcome Measure; Outcome Study; Oxygen; Pain; palliation; Palliative Care; Patient Monitoring; Patient Outcomes Assessments; patient population; Patients; Pattern; Peripheral; personalized medicine; Physiological; Placebos; predictive marker; Public Health; Quality of life; Randomized; Randomized Controlled Trials; Reporting; Research; respiratory; response; Role; spinal cord compression; study population; Swelling; Symptoms; Testing; therapeutic target; Therapy Clinical Trials; Time; TNF gene; treatment response; United States National Institutes of Health; ","A Randomized Controlled Trial of Dexamethasone for Dyspnea in Cancer Patients","214960","NRCS","Nursing and Related Clinical Sciences Study Section ","","A1","01","275986","152602","428588",""

While current therapeutics have their merits and employ diverse mechanisms of action, there are side effects that become evident after years of clinical application.

Current evidence demonstrates that women with milder forms of hyperglycemia or elevated blood sugar (approximately 13% who do not meet the criteria for GDM under the current testing guidelines) may share these same risks as those with GDM. Better identification and treatment of these women with mild hyperglycemia may result in improved perinatal outcomes and a decreased risk of future diabetes. Under the current GDM screening strategy, these women are considered 'normal' but a one-step strategy with more strict diagnostic criteria would better identify these women. This trial will provide evidence as t the optimal screening strategies for GDM.

Most Leishmania infections are asymptomatic; thus there are likely many more infections than the ~600 reported symptomatic cases. Leishmania have dramatic effects on the host immune response and infections tend to persist long-term, leading us to hypothesize that there may be immune consequences of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections. In this application we propose to examine the content and function of small vesicles called exosomes released from Leishmania parasites and from human cells infected with the parasite. Exosomes spread mediators of immune responses throughout the host. We hypothesize that Leishmania-derived exosomes may be responsible for the profound effects of these parasites on host immunity. These effects could be active in persons who are unaware that they are even infected.","1946674; ","WILSON, MARY E;","","10/01/2009","06/30/2019","adaptive immune response; Affect; Afghanistan; American; Antigens; base; Biological Response Modifiers; cell type; Cells; Chronic; Clinical; Country; Cutaneous; Cutaneous Leishmaniasis; Diagnosis; Disease; Disease Outbreaks; Distant; Environment; Epidemic; Exhibits; exosome; Freedom; HIV Infections; Human; human disease; Immune; Immune response; Immunity; Immunocompromised Host; immunoregulation; Individual; Infection; Iraq; Kuwait; Lead; Leishmania; Leishmania infantum; Leishmania major; Leishmaniasis; Life; Lipids; Location; macrophage; Mammalian Cell; Measurable; member; Methods; Microbe; microbial; microbicide; MicroRNAs; Middle East; Military Personnel; monocyte; mouse model; Mus; Nature; novel strategies; operation; Organ; Parasites; Parasitic Diseases; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; peripheral blood; Persons; Property; Proteins; Protozoa; public health relevance; Publications; Reporting; response; Risk; RNA; Role; Sampling; Serum; Signal Transduction; Skin Ulcer; Small RNA; Soldier; Symptoms; Testing; Urine; Vector-transmitted infectious disease; Vesicle; vesicular release; Virulence; Visceral; Visceral Leishmaniasis; World War II; ","The Role of Exosomes in the Pathogenesis of Leishmaniasis","000536","INFB","Infectious Diseases B ","","","07","","","",""

Diabetic wounds, pressure ulcers, and leg ulcers are very common problems in our Veteran population. The administration of growth factors to heal chronic wounds has largely failed. During the last VA funding cycle, we discovered that the secreted form of heat shock protein-90alpha (Hsp90) promotes the migration of keratinocytes, dermal fibroblasts, and microvascular endothelial cells (the three salient cells needed to heal a skin wound) and dramatically accelerates the closure of acute and diabetic skin wounds in animals. In this proposal, we will establish a 'preclinical' porcine model and the mechanistic data necessary for an investigational new drug (IND) application to the FDA and advance the translation of Hsp90 for use in patients, particularly our Veteran patients who suffer greatly from diabetic and chronic skin wounds.","1878642; ","WOODLEY, DAVID T.;","","07/01/2014","06/30/2018","Acute; Adult; Animals; Applications Grants; base; Basement membrane; Becaplermin; Biological; Biopsy; Bypass; Cell Culture Techniques; cell motility; Cell Proliferation; Cells; chronic wound; Cicatrix; Clinic; Clinical Trials; Cutis Laxa; Data; Decubitus ulcer; Defect; Dermal; Diabetes Mellitus; diabetic; Diabetic mouse; diabetic patient; Diabetic wound; diabetic wound healing; Disease; drug development; Drug Kinetics; efficacy testing; Elderly; Endothelial Cells; Environment; Essential Drugs; Exhibits; Experimental Models; extracellular; Family suidae; Fibroblasts; Fibrosis; Funding; Gel; Goals; Grant; Granulation Tissue; Growth Factor; healing; Health; Health Care Costs; Heat shock proteins; Hepatotoxicity; Histology; Human; human migration; Hyperglycemia; Hypoxia; Hypoxia Inducible Factor; Impaired wound healing; In Vitro; in vivo; Injection of therapeutic agent; Investigational New Drug Application; keratinocyte; Laboratories; Lateral; Leg Ulcer; Lesion; liver metabolism; Lower Extremity; Microscopic; migration; Modeling; Mus; Myofibroblast; neovascularization; New Agents; non-diabetic; patient population; Patients; Peptides; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Physiological; Platelet-Derived Growth Factor; Population; pre-clinical; Preparation; Property; protein metabolism; Proteins; public health relevance; Publishing; Recombinants; regenerative; Reporting; Research; Skin; Skin wound; Streptozocin; Supplementation; Testing; Therapeutic; Time; Topical application; Translations; Vascularization; Veterans; wound closure; Wound Healing; ","Re-epithelialization of Skin Wounds","002028","SURG","Surgery ","","","04","","","",""

NMDA receptor dysfunction is linked to multiple neuro-psychiatric disorders. NMDA-mediated hyperexcitability contributes to epilepsy. Conditions that result in a hypo-NMDA state such as after ingestion of the NMDA receptor antagonist, PCP, will produce a state that almost completely mirrors the abnormal behavior in schizophrenia. The prevalence of epilepsy and schizophrenia is 1% of the general population for each, similar to that in the VA population. Furthermore, NMDA receptors are the targets of some of the latest medications to treat Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia.

PROJECT NARRATIVE  The neocortex is important in perception and cognition, but the number and complexity of interactions between cortical neurons necessitates greater understanding of fundamental principles of neocortical organization at the local circuit level (tens to hundreds of neurons) in order to unravel the mechanisms of high level brain functions. This project will examine the functional and connectivity principles of developmentally related neurons, and how that relationship leads to excitatory neuron integration into the circuit and organization of cortical function. The results of this project will have the potential to reveal fundamental new insights into how the cortex processes incoming information and will thus enable a more principled understanding of normal and abnormal brain function, with broad implications for a wide range of currently intractable neuropsychiatric illnesses such as autism and schizophrenia.","11530010; ","FAHEY, PAUL GERRARD;","DRISCOLL, JAMIE ","09/20/2016","09/19/2019","Address; Adult; area striata; Autistic Disorder; Brain; brain abnormalities; brain research; Calcium; Cells; Cognition; Complex; Cortical Column; Development; Dimensions; Electrophysiology (science); excitatory neuron; Exhibits; experimental study; Frequencies; hippocampal pyramidal neuron; Hippocampus (Brain); Image; improved; in vivo calcium imaging; Income; Individual; inhibitory neuron; insight; Interneurons; Location; Maintenance; Measures; Morphology; multi-photon; Mus; Neocortex; neocortical; Neurons; neuropsychiatry; novel; Output; Pattern; Perception; Photons; Play; Process; Property; receptive field; Recording of previous events; Research; Role; Schizophrenia; Sensory; sensory input; Surface; Synapses; synaptogenesis; System; Testing; Visual; Visual Cortex; Work; ","Feature Selectivity and Interneuron Connectivity Principles of Clonally-Related Excitatory Neurons in Mouse Primary Visual Cortex","112312","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","44370","","44370",""

We have also developed selective amplification methods that enable detection of low-abundance cancer-specific mutations (0.01%) in a background of genomic DNA. The combination of these methods enable the detection of common cancer related mutations that are shed by a somatic tumor into circulating blood. Our goal is to develop a blood-based ?liquid biopsy? assay to screen for 10 or more cancer- specific mutations that are indicative of a high cancer risk, or that identifies a specific cancer probability. Such a test could be employed on a routine basis or as part of an annual physical exam, and would provide an enormous benefit to public health. The Specific Aims of this Phase I grant are: 1) to test and compare selective-amplification methods for detecting low-abundance, pan-cancer driver mutations and 2) to develop and validate our prototype assay for pan-cancer driver mutations in plasma genomic DNA samples. Success in Phase I will enable early cancer detection through a non-invasive approach, and it will justify expanded Phase II studies with ~100 circulating cancer biomarkers (actionable and drug-resistant variants) in preparation for FDA approval.","1869963; ","SHAFER, DAVID A;","FRANCA-KOH, JONATHAN C.","09/18/2017","09/17/2018","actionable mutation; base; Binding; Biological Assay; Biopsy; Blood; Blood Circulation; Blood specimen; BRAF gene; cancer biomarkers; Cancer Patient; cancer risk; cancer type; cell free DNA; Colorectal Cancer; Communicable Diseases; Companions; cost; CTNNB1 gene; Data; Detection; Development; Diagnostic; diagnostic assay; Diagnostic tests; digital; Discrimination; Distal; DNA amplification; Doctor of Philosophy; Drug resistance; Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor; FDA approved; Fluorescence; follow-up; Frequencies; Genomic DNA; Goals; Grant; Health Benefit; High-Risk Cancer; improved; Journals; Label; Legal patent; liquid biopsy; malignant breast neoplasm; Malignant neoplasm of lung; Malignant neoplasm of ovary; Malignant neoplasm of prostate; Malignant Neoplasms; Methods; molecular diagnostics; mutant; Mutate; Mutation; Neoplasm Circulating Cells; neoplastic cell; Neuroblastoma; next generation sequencing; Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests; Patients; Phase; phase 1 study; phase 2 study; Physicians; Plasma; Preparation; Prevalence; prevent; Primary carcinoma of the liver cells; Probability; prototype; Public Health; Publishing; rare variant; Research; Sampling; Scanning; screening; Screening for cancer; Series; Specificity; Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization; Speed; Statistical Methods; success; System; targeted treatment; Technology; Temperature; Testing; The Cancer Genome Atlas; Time; Tissues; tumor; tumor DNA; validation studies; Variant; web site; ","Blood biopsy test for pan-cancer mutations with error-checking probes","221412","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","","","242611",""

Previous work suggests that Luminal B tumors are highly prevalent among Latina breast cancer patients from Colombia and that this linkage is related to Native American Ancestry. These results suggest a major contribution of ancestry in the modulation of key genomic players in defining not only the intrinsic breast cancer subtypes, but also the differential response to treatment and overall survival in Luminal B tumors. This work will test the hypothesis that Native American ancestry associated with a high incidence of aggressive Luminal B tumors due to altered DNA modification that changes the expression of key genes involved in aggressive breast cancer.","1896485; ","CRESS, WILLIAM D;","","","","Admixture; African; African American; Age; Alaska Native; American; Asians; base; biobank; Biological; Breast Cancer Patient; Cancer Center; cancer health disparity; cancer subtypes; candidate identification; caucasian American; Classification; Clinical; cohort; Colombia; Data; Disease; DNA Modification Process; Endocrine; Enhancers; epidemiology study; erbB-2 Receptor; ERBB2 gene; Estrogen Receptor alpha; Ethnic group; Ethnic Origin; European; Frequencies; Gene Expression; Genes; Genetic; Genomic Segment; Genomics; Goals; GRB7 gene; Health; Hispanics; hormone therapy; improved; Incidence; Indigenous American; Latina; Lead; Link; malignant breast neoplasm; Malignant Neoplasms; Methylation; migration; Molecular; Molecular Analysis; Molecular Epidemiology; molecular subtypes; mortality; Mutation; Native Americans; Not Hispanic or Latino; novel; Nuclear Hormone Receptors; Outcome; outcome forecast; Patients; Pilot Projects; Population; Portraits; precision medicine; Prognostic Marker; Proliferation Marker; promoter; prospective; Puerto Rico; Race; racial and ethnic; Recurrence; Reporting; Research; Research Training; Resistance; Risk; SEER Program; Specimen; Testing; Therapeutic; Tissue Sample; Tissues; transcriptome sequencing; Translating; treatment response; tumor; United States; Woman; Work; ","Research Pilot Project","202920","ZCA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","5805","A1","01","59740","43013","","102753"

Current military conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have led to over 200,000 reported cases of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Among Veterans, mTBI commonly co-occurs with chronic, psychiatric conditions including alcohol use disorder (AUD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Direct inpatient and outpatient annual costs to the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) are in excess of $300 million with cost of care correlating with level of disability. Physica therapy (PT) remains the primary strategy to improve motor function, but there is a clear need to enhance its efficacy. The development of adjunct therapy to provide neurorestorative benefit is needed. The goals of this project are to demonstrate that fibroblast growth factor therapy is such a strategy and to delineate the mechanisms through which it works.

The chronic pain is often worsened by comorbid depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Stress has been shown to alter brain circuitry that modifies pain perception, suggesting that studying altered circuitry in chronic pain could lead to novel therapies. The aims of this study are designed to identify how stress alters the medial prefrontal cortex leading to a dysfunctional brain circuit (determined by real-time modulation with optogenetic techniques) that modulates chronic stress-induced pain. These findings may also identify targets for the development of novel therapeutic strategies directed at the brain, specifically the limbic areas of the brain, to improve the treatment or even reduce the risk for the development of chronic stress- induced pain in veterans.

There was early interest in EGFR inhibitors as a potential treatment for breast cancer because EGFR shows a high expression pattern in breast cancer and is also negatively correlated to patient outcomes, but research on the inhibitors began to stall because a majority of patients did not respond to the inhibitors or eventually became resistant to the inhibitors. Fortunately, new evidence suggest that secondary pathways contribute to EGFR inhibitor resistance, and our own preliminary experiments expand on this finding, specifically implicating the ROR1 pathway as a major contributor to EGFR resistance that may be co-targeted with EGFR to enhance the effectiveness of an EGFR inhibitor based therapeutic strategy.","10941662; ","YANG, LIUQING ;","SALNIKOW, KONSTANTIN ","09/18/2017","08/31/2022","Address; American; Animal Model; Antineoplastic Agents; base; Biological; Biological Assay; Breast cancer metastasis; Breast Cancer Patient; Breast Cancer therapy; Breast Cancer Treatment; Cancer Cell Growth; Cancer Patient; cancer type; Cells; Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure; Clinical; Clinical Trials; clinically relevant; Colorectal Cancer; combinatorial; Combined Modality Therapy; cytotoxicity; Data; Distal; Early Diagnosis; Effectiveness; Enzymes; Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor; Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor; ERBB3 gene; Estrogen Receptors; experimental study; Family member; FDA approved; Foundations; Genetic Transcription; Goals; high throughput screening; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Human; improved; Incidence; inhibitor/antagonist; interest; Knock-out; Ligands; malignant breast neoplasm; Malignant neoplasm of lung; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; Molecular; Molecular Biology; Monoclonal Antibodies; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; mouse model; mutant; Neoplasm Metastasis; new therapeutic target; novel therapeutics; Outcome; Outcomes Research; overexpression; Pathway interactions; Patient Care Planning; Patient-Focused Outcomes; Patients; Pattern; personalized medicine; Phosphorylation; Phosphotransferases; Post-Translational Protein Processing; pre-clinical; Pre-Clinical Model; Progesterone Receptors; programs; receptor; receptor binding; receptor expression; Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases; Research; Resistance; Resistance development; response; Role; ROR1 gene; Sequencing Biochemistry; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; success; System; targeted agent; targeted treatment; theories; Therapeutic; Tissues; Translating; treatment strategy; triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma; tumor; tumor growth; Tyrosine; United States; Work; Xenograft procedure; ","Combinatorial Treatment Strategies to Counteract EGFR Resistance","218036","TCB","Tumor Cell Biology Study Section ","","","01","244764","143784","388548",""

IFGeneRA proposes to build a progressive evidence base for which results may need to be fed back, when and how. It combines methods from medical genetics, bioethics, genetic counselling, health economics, bioinformatics, and social science to explore these issues. In rural Cameroon, the project will retrospectively explore the effect of receiving a genetic diagnosis of Fragile X on the lives of affected patients, families and communities. This project will allow us to learn more about the way in which modern genetic knowledge interacts with traditional knowledge. In Botswana and South Africa, we will conduct a prospective study to investigate the preferences of participants enrolled in pediatric genomics research on HIV and on neurodevelopmental conditions (mainly autism), and in adult genomics research on psychotic disorders (schizophrenia and bipolar disorder). In those countries, we will also explore the perspectives of professionals involved in the development, implementation or application of feedback policies for genomics research. In the third component of our work, which cuts across all three countries, we will explore the scope of the feedback of findings problem and develop a normative account of ethical obligations for feedback for researchers in lower and middle income countries. Wrapping up all of these activities, we will conduct a continental survey to explore wider perspectives on feedback of findings in the final year of our Centre.","11677120; 11210597 (contact); ","DE VRIES, JANTINA ; WONKAM, AMBROISE  (contact);","MADDEN, EBONY B","09/20/2017","06/30/2022","Adult; Affect; Africa; African; AIDS/HIV problem; Anthropology; Attention; Autistic Disorder; Back; base; Belief; Bioethics; Bioinformatics; Bipolar Disorder; Botswana; Cameroon; Child; Childhood; cohort; Communities; Consult; cost; Country; Data Set; Development; development policy; Disease; Drama; Enrollment; Ethical Analysis; Ethics; Ethnography; evidence base; expectation; experience; Family; Feedback; feeding; Focus Groups; Fragile X Syndrome; Frequencies; Genetic; Genetic Counseling; genetic disorder diagnosis; Genetic Research; Genomics; health economics; Hereditary Disease; HIV; Income; Individual; insight; Interview; Knowledge; Learning; Literature; low and middle-income countries; man; Medical Genetics; meetings; member; Mental Retardation; Methodology; Methods; Modernization; Murder; Nature; Outcome Study; Parents; Participant; Pathogenicity; Patients; Policies; Policy Developments; preference; Prospective Studies; Psychotic Disorders; Publications; Regulation; Reporting; Research; Research Personnel; Research Project Grants; Resources; Rural; rural setting; Schizophrenia; Social Sciences; South Africa; Surveys; Testing; urban setting; Variant; virtual; Work; working group; ","Individual Findings in Genetic Research in Africa (IFGeneRA)","009790","ZHG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","462799","37024","499823",""

In the United States, over 8 million women and 2 million men age 50 and above have osteoporosis. Another 51 million women and 35 million men have osteopenia. This translates into a higher risk of fracture within this population, with half of all women and one quarter of men projected to suffer a low bone mass-related fracture. Osteoporotic fractures impart deleterious consequences, including increased hospitalization and mortality. An estimated 25% of individuals will die within one year of a hip fracture.

This project uses an innovative spectroscopy called resonant inelastic X-ray scattering and develops a new type of detection for L-edge X-ray absorbance spectroscopy to make unprecedented observations of the activation of O2 by the iron in heme-containing enzymes to better understand the chemistry of heme enzymes related to the chemistry of their non-heme containing counterparts with respect to their impact on human health.","11970536; ","GEE, LELAND BRUCE;","FLICKER, PAULA F.","09/16/2017","09/15/2020","absorption; Academia; Affect; alpha ketoglutarate; Apoptosis; base; Biological; biological systems; Biology; career; Cations; Characteristics; Chemistry; cholesterol biosynthesis; circular magnetic dichroism; cofactor; Complex; computational chemistry; Coupled; Cysteine; cytochrome c; Cytochrome P450; Data Analyses; Detection; detector; Development; Dioxygen; driving force; Drug Metabolic Detoxication; drug metabolism; Due Process; Electron Transport; electronic structure; Electrons; Electrostatics; Environment; Enzyme Reactivation; Enzymes; Exhibits; Fluorescence; frontier; Genes; Health; Heme; heme a; Heme Iron; Histidine; Hormones; Human; Human Genome; Hydrogen Bonding; Hydroxylation; innovation; insight; interest; Iron; Knowledge; Ligands; Ligation; Mechanics; Mentorship; Methionine; Methods; Modeling; molecular orbital; Nature; Noise; Optics; Outcome; Oxygen; oxygen transport; Photons; Play; porphyrin a; Porphyrins; preference; Property; Pterins; quantum; Reaction; Research; Resolution; Roentgen Rays; Role; Sampling; sensor; simulation; Site; Spectrum Analysis; Steroid biosynthesis; steroid hormone; steroid metabolism; Structure; System; Techniques; tool; Tyrosine; Vacuum; Work; X ray spectroscopy; ","Electronic Structure of Heme Enzyme Intermediates from Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering and L-Edge X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy","122194","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","01","56694","","56694",""

However, anticipated future pharmacological and ge- netic treatments for hearing loss will require advanced noninvasive diagnostic tests that can both de- tect hearing loss and distinguish among hearing losses with different underlying deficits and etiolo- gies. Building on recent research that has revealed the power of OAEs to gauge cochlear properties such as nonlinearity, amplification, and frequency tuning, the workshop Otoacoustic Emissions: Evok- ing the Future will bring together leading and aspiring researchers from around the world to transform the future application of OAEs as noninvasive probes of cochlear function and hearing.","2090826; 1867766 (contact); ","ABDALA, CAROLINA ; SHERA, CHRISTOPHER A (contact);","KING, KELLY ANNE","09/19/2017","08/31/2018","Acoustics; Anniversary; Area; Biological Assay; California; Chemicals; Clinic; Communities; Complex; Detection; Development; Diagnosis; Diagnostic tests; Differential Diagnosis; doctoral student; Ear; educational atmosphere; Educational workshop; Fostering; Frequencies; Future; Generations; Goals; Health; Hearing; hearing impairment; hearing screening; Human; Huntington Disease; innovation; Interdisciplinary Study; Knowledge; Libraries; Medial; meetings; Monitor; neglect; Noise; Otolaryngology; Pathology; Pharmacology; Postdoctoral Fellow; Property; Publishing; Regulation; relating to nervous system; Reporting; Research; Research Personnel; San Marino; screening; Senior Scientist; Sensory; Shapes; Spontaneous Otoacoustic Emissions; success; Talents; Time; tool; Toxic effect; Universities; Work; ","Otoacoustic Emissions: Evoking the Future","016825","ZDC1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","26995","0","26995",""

The recent approvals of immune checkpoint inhibitors, nivolumab and pembrolizumab, for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer have represented a major step forward, however little is understood as to (1) how adaptive immune resistance occurs within the tumor, (2), why only a small subset of patients respond to anti-PD-1 and (3) what are the T cells targeting at a genetic level. The leading hypothesis is that the mutation landscape is important with data now emerging from our group and others, demonstrating the mutation load is important in immune checkpoint blockade response however this needs to be studied more exhaustively. This proposal will apply new technologies to the study of response and resistance to immunotherapies in the context of a multi-disciplinary team with expertise in patient-oriented research and immune monitoring, comprehensive genetics and informatics analysis of the tumor microenvironment with state of the art validation in vitro and mouse modeling.

Stimulus waveforms will initially be constructed off-line and then implemented clinically with recipients of implanted standing systems. Methods for automatically tuning stimulation for optimal performance will be determined in a parallel set of animal studies generalizable to other applications and interface technologies. The optimized stimulus waveforms will then be deployed clinically and compared to the hand-crafted controllers.

Every year, ~520, 000 new cases were diagnosed and about 270,000 women die of this disease. Although high risk human papillomavirus (hrHPVs) are thought to be the causing factors for cervical cancer, both epidemiological and biological evidence indicate that unknown factors unique to individual hosts appear to contribute to the dysplastic transformation and disease progression. Achievement of this project will identify the Hippo/YAP pathway as a novel and key regulator of the tumorigenic process in the cervix and will not only significantly expand our knowledge on cervical carcinogenesis, but will also provide new targets for the prevention and treatment of cervical cancer.

If either ciliogenesis or Shh signaling is abnormal, various disease states can arise. Thus, to develop targeted therapeutics, it is critical that only one pathway is affected. Here we use a series of novel mouse models as an entry point for cell culture systems that genetically uncouple ciliogenesis and Shh signaling, and in the process paint a clearer mechanistic picture of each.

Early detection is critical for survival because therapies are primarily supportive. Thus, a major public health challenge is to develop specific and easily assessed biomarkers that identify patients that are deteriorating due to an unregulated inflammatory response to infection. We have identified that brainstem nuclei that maintain respiration, heart rate and breathing, as well as those that control the inflammatory response, become inflamed during sepsis. We hypothesize that inflammation in these nuclei uncouples cardiorespiratory control and leads to organ dysfunction, so we propose analyzing complementary indices of cardiorespiratory coupling as sensitive and prognostic biomarkers. Further, we propose to model the time-dependence of the central inflammation to determine its dependence and interaction with the peripheral inflammatory response and to determine the role of cytokines in the loss of brainstem control mechanisms.

Although the immediate effects of a single mTBI usually resolve over days or weeks, multiple mTBIs can lead to both persistent symptoms and, years later, to two fatal progressive brain diseases, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is believed that CTE and AD are caused by nerve damaging chemicals called tau and beta amyloid produced by the brain but which are not removed from the brain in a normal manner in persons with mTBIs. We will determine in Veterans who experienced mTBIs whether a clinically available drug called prazosin increases removal of tau and beta amyloid from the brain. This will be accomplished by seeing if prazosin reduces the amount of tau and beta amyloid in the spinal fluid that surrounds the brain. If we find such reductions, prazosin will be evaluated as a preventative treatment for CTE and AD in future studies.","1872786; ","RASKIND, MURRAY A;","","07/01/2016","06/30/2018","Address; Afghanistan; Alzheimer's Disease; Amyloid; Amyloid beta-Protein; Area; Biological Assay; Biological Markers; Blast Cell; Brain; Brain Concussion; Brain Diseases; Brain Injuries; brain parenchyma; Cerebrospinal Fluid; Cessation of life; Chemicals; chronic traumatic encephalopathy; Clinical; Cognitive deficits; Coma; Conflict (Psychology); Dementia; Deposition; Devices; Disease; Drops; Elderly; Evaluation Studies; Excision; experience; Explosion; Freedom; Future; glymphatic system; hyperphosphorylated tau; Impairment; Injury; innovation; Iraq; Laboratories; Lead; Measures; middle age; Mild Concussions; mild traumatic brain injury; Nerve; Nerve Degeneration; Neuraxis; Neurodegenerative Disorders; Neurofibrillary Tangles; neurotoxic; Neurotoxins; noradrenergic; novel; operation; Oral; Paralysed; Pathogenesis; peptide P; Peptides; persistent symptom; Persons; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacotherapy; Pilot Projects; Placebo Control; Placebos; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders; Prazosin; preclinical study; Prevention; Preventive treatment; Primary Prevention; Production; Proteins; public health relevance; Randomized; rapid eye movement; Recording of previous events; research clinical testing; Risk; Risk Factors; service member; Signal Transduction; Sleep; Spinal Puncture; Symptoms; System; tau Proteins; tau-1; treatment effect; United States; Veterans; War; ","Prazosin and CSF Biomarkers in mTBI","002180","RRDS","Rehabilitation Research and Development SPiRE Program ","","","02","","","",""

As no accepted therapeutic interventions exist for TBI, these Veterans receive only supportive care. Thus, it is imperative to identify effective treatment strategies that will target the secondary injury mechanisms that persist for month to years following TBI and successfully improve the chronic neurological dysfunctions. Previous studies suggest that exercise may be able to attenuate chronic TBI-induced neurological dysfunctions. As the ability to intervene late after TBI is important, we propose to test the neuroprotective potential of delayed exercise and select pharmacologic interventions targeting neuroinflammation mechanisms both separately and in combination using a well-established experimental TBI model.

The sophisticated meta-analyses planned for the proposed study will integrate data from five major U.S. longitudinal cohorts to provide new, more reliable estimates of effect size and dose that can be used to further refine diagnosis of FASD by (a) identifying the most sensitive endpoints seen in children with these disorders and (b) determining the levels and patterns of exposure most reliably associated with adverse effects. These data will provide information that will be critical for the further refinement of the new provisional diagnosis for FASD (designated as a ?condition in need of further study? in the latest edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) and will lay the ground work for development of new interventions more specifically targeted at the deficits that characterize these disorders.

These alterations lead to the formation of colon polyps that can evolve into CRC. Although virtually all CRCs arise from adenomatous polyps or serrated polyps, it is estimated that only approximately 5% of polyps ultimately progress to cancer. We will determine whether the epigenetic, transcriptional and genetic states established during the ?birth? of a polyp governs whether the polyp will be a benign proliferative lesion, with no potential to become cancer, or a premalignant lesion that will evolve into cancer. Our ability to address this question is the result of access to a highly unique and near singular set of human polyps that have been serially observed over time using CT colonography. These polyps have been observed to remain stable, which reflects a benign proliferative state, or to grow, which reflects the potential to become a CRC. Using cutting edge experimental methods, we will assess the genome wide genetic alterations, transcriptional changes, and epigenetic alterations in the polyps and determine whether the patterns of alterations established during polyp formation determine the ultimate fate of the polyp, which is to grow and progress to a deadly cancer or merely remain stable. Our studies have the potential to identify factors that affect the progression of polyps to CRC and will provide insight into the idea that some polyps may be ?born to be bad? rather than ?being born good and becoming bad over time?.

The Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation have recently estimated that 1,275,000 people are living with paralysis from SCI in the United States alone. This country could save an estimated $400 billion on direct and indirect lifetime costs if we can find ways to treat and prevent SCI. Bladder dysfunction affects daily life, reduces quality of life and results in numerous life-long health complications. Improvements in bladder function have been recently discovered in SCI subjects while they are undergoing an efficacious rehabilitation intervention, activity-based locomotor training (LT). In addition, multiple individuals with motor complete SCI who have received epidural stimulation in combination with LT also have significant improvements in bladder function. This proposal is an early feasibility study in a small number of subjects for a novel clinical application (bladder dysfunction after SCI) of a marketed Medtronic device (initial clinical safety and device functionality study). A parallel animal study will also be done. The overall objective of this study is to demonstrate that lumbosacral epidural stimulation may be a viable therapeutic strategy for improving storage (continence) and urination (voiding) after SCI. The knowledge gained from our innovative application of an existing stimulation device may lead to the translation and immediate application to a larger cohort of SCI individuals and provide immense improvements in quality of life.","1884506; 6490947 (contact); ","HARKEMA, SUSAN J; HUBSCHER, CHARLES H.

Excitingly, we identified the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 4 (CHRM4, M4) gene as significantly decreased in RTT patients and established that M4 positive allosteric modulation normalizes several aspects of the disease in model mice. We propose to expand on this discovery using Mecp2 knockout mice and a novel set of patient autopsy samples, while also determining whether complementary domains of the RTT-phenotype can be rescued by mimicking cell autonomous functions of late response proteins.","9716973; ","GOGLIOTTI, ROCCO GEORGE;","DRISCOLL, JAMIE ","09/19/2017","06/30/2021","Address; Adopted; Adverse effects; Agonist; Anxiety; Area; Atrophic; Attention; Attenuated; Autopsy; Back; Behavioral; Brain; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; career; career development; Cells; Cerebellum; Chemosensitization; Childhood; cholinergic neuron; CHRM4 gene; Clinical; clinical Diagnosis; Cognitive; conditioned fear; Data; density; design; Disease; Disease model; Dose; Electrophysiology (science); Etiology; Excision; Exhibits; experience; experimental study; Exposure to; Faculty; Genes; Genetic; Glutamates; Goals; Head; Hippocampus (Brain); Human; IGF1 gene; improved; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I; Intervention; K-Series Research Career Programs; Knock-out; Knockout Mice; Link; loss of function mutation; Mediating; Mentors; Mentorship; Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors; Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2; Microcephaly; Modeling; Molecular; Molecular Profiling; Motor; Motor Cortex; mouse model; Mus; Mutation; nervous system disorder; Neurodevelopmental Disorder; neuron loss; Neurons; next generation sequencing; novel; Outcome Measure; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pharmacology; Pharmacology Study; Phenotype; Plant Roots; Population; Positioning Attribute; positive allosteric modulator; pre-clinical; preference; Probability; Proteins; receptor; Recombinants; relating to nervous system; Research; respiratory; response; Rett Syndrome; Rodent; Role; Sampling; Schizophrenia; Signal Transduction; social; success; Symptoms; Synapses; Synaptic Transmission; tenure track; Testing; theories; Therapeutic; Tissues; tool; Training; transcription factor; transcriptome sequencing; Translating; treatment strategy; ","Normalizing E:I imbalance in Rett Syndrome by Modulation of Late Response Genes","112983","TAG","Therapeutic Approaches to Genetic Diseases Study Section ","","A1","01","126333","10107","136440",""

Hyaluronic acids (HA) are major ECM components and patients with liver cirrhosis show an elevation of blood HA levels. Since the biological functions of endogenous HA have not been determined in liver fibrosis, we will investigate the roles of endogenous HA and its downstream effector pathway in HSC activation and liver fibrosis.

For example, minority nurses are much more likely to work in underserved areas. The 28 HBCU nursing programs have prepared more nurses of color than the other 680 schools combined, yet five have closed and nine others have been suspended or placed on warning or probation.

Accordingly, intensive efforts have been directed towards understanding the structural, functional and antigenic characteristics of HIV trimers. The flexibility and antigenicity of trimers progressively changes as trimers become increasingly saturated with CD4. Certain conformations allow combinations of neutralizing antibodies and/or both neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies to bind a single trimer. We propose a novel single molecule fluorescence approach that detects multiple epitope exposures on a single virion trimer revealing conformational dynamics between two epitope probes. The outcome of this project will afford important information regarding the structural and antigenic dynamics of the HIV envelope, which should provide novel insights for the generation of antiviral agents and anti-HIV immunity.","9230588; ","RAY, KRISHANU ;","SAKALIAN, MICHAEL ","09/30/2015","08/31/2020","Antibodies; Antiviral Agents; base; Binding; Biological Assay; CCR5 gene; CD4 Antigens; Cell-Matrix Junction; Characteristics; Chronic; Cleaved cell; Color; CXCR4 gene; Data; Detection; Epitopes; Evaluation; Exhibits; Fab Immunoglobulins; flexibility; Fluorescence; Fluorescence Anisotropy; Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer; Fluorescence Spectroscopy; Generations; Genetic; HIV; HIV Envelope Protein gp120; HIV Infections; HIV-1; Immunity; insight; Ligand Binding; Measurement; Measures; Mediating; Methods; Molecular Conformation; Nature; neutralizing antibody; novel; novel strategies; Outcome; Phenotype; Positioning Attribute; public health relevance; Reagent; Reporting; Resistance; response; Series; single molecule; single-molecule FRET; Spectrum Analysis; stoichiometry; Structure; Testing; Time; Vaccines; Viral; Virion; Virus; Virus Replication; ","Conformational Dynamics of HIV Envelope by Single Molecule Spectroscopy","117836","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","S1","03","49760","","49760",""

Failed repairs result in significantly more muscle degeneration, and even successful repairs fail to reverse or reduce this pathological process. Muscle degeneration is a strong predictor of patient outcomes: fatty infiltration and atrophy of the muscle correlate with pain, functional deficits, and post-surgical tear recurrence. Thus, therapies that slow or reverse muscle degeneration promise to improve clinical outcomes after RCT and decrease total societal costs.","2108099; ","BOTCHWEY, EDWARD A.;","WANG, FEI ","09/18/2017","08/31/2019","Address; Adoptive Transfer; Aging; Agonist; angiogenesis; Anti-inflammatory; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Apoptotic; Articular Range of Motion; base; Behavior; Biocompatible Materials; Biological Assay; Blood; Blood Vessels; Caliber; Cell Communication; Cell Maintenance; Cell Proliferation; Cells; Clinical; cost; cytokine; Defect; Deposition; disability; Dorsal Skinfold Window Chamber Model; Dose; Elderly; Endothelium; Engineering; Environmental Risk Factor; Exhibits; experimental study; Fiber; Fibrosis; Flow Cytometry; Functional disorder; functional outcomes; Genetic Models; Growth; Growth Factor; healing; Histologic; Human; Immune; Immune response; Immunologics; Impaired wound healing; Implant; improved; in vivo; Infiltration; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Inflammatory Infiltrate; injured; Injury; innovation; Kinetics; Lipids; liquid chromatography mass spectrometry; macrophage; Measures; Metabolic; Metabolism; Microvascular Dysfunction; Modeling; monocyte; Mononuclear; Morphology; mouse model; Mus; Muscle; muscle degeneration; Muscle Fibers; Muscle satellite cell; Muscular Atrophy; Myeloid Cells; nanofiber; nerve transection; Neuromuscular Junction; Operative Surgical Procedures; Outcome; Pain; Paper; Pathologic Processes; Patient-Focused Outcomes; Phagocytes; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacology; Polymers; Population; Pre-Clinical Model; Prevention; progenitor; Proteins; Publishing; quadriceps muscle; RANTES; receptor; reconstruction; Recovery; Recovery of Function; Recruitment Activity; Recurrence; regenerative; repaired; Research; Resolution; response; Rest; rotator cuff tear; satellite cell; scaffold; Shoulder Pain; Signal Transduction; Skeletal Muscle; Skeletal muscle injury; small molecule; Source; Spatial Distribution; sphingosine 1-phosphate; Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptor; stem; Symptoms; System; Therapeutic; Time; Tissues; TNF gene; tool; Trauma; Vascularization; Work; Wound Healing; ","Immune Modulatory Nanofibers for Skeletal Muscle Reconstruction","071708","MTE","Musculoskeletal Tissue Engineering Study Section ","","A1","01","250000","144500","394500",""

Cardiac hypertrophy in response to pressure overload, such as chronic hypertension, is a major predictor for the development of heart failure, and is also an independent risk factor for myocardial infarction, arrhythmia and sudden death. Modulation of pathological myocardial hypertrophy is increasingly recognized as a potentially promising approach in the prevention of development of heart failure. Our recent study found that the valosin-containing protein (VCP), a protein which is previously uncharacterized in the heart, represents a mediator of cardioprotection that is directly relevant to the condition of cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction induced by hypertension in patients. In this proposal, we will elucidate further the physiological relevance and the underlying mechanisms of VCP in the heart at baseline and under pressure overload. This study will prove critical to develop novel therapeutic avenues for preventing hypertensive heart failure by the manipulation of VCP expression.","9640105; ","QIU, HONGYU ;","WONG, RENEE P","09/22/2017","08/31/2018","age related; Aging; Animal Model; Arrhythmia; Attenuated; base; Cardiac; Cardiac Myocytes; cardiogenesis; Cardiomyopathies; Chronic; Complex; constriction; Data; Deterioration; Family suidae; FRAP1 gene; Growth; Heart; Heart failure; Heart Hypertrophy; Hospitalization; Hypertension; Hypertrophy; Impairment; In Vitro; in vivo; Left ventricular structure; Link; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; Molecular; mortality; mouse model; Myocardial; Myocardial dysfunction; Myocardial Infarction; N Domain; N-terminal; normotensive; novel; novel therapeutics; originality; overexpression; Pathogenesis; Pathologic; Patients; Physiological; Play; pressure; prevent; Prevention; Process; protein expression; Proteins; Publications; Rattus; Research; response; Risk Factors; Role; Scheme; Signal Transduction; Stress; Sudden Death; Testing; Therapeutic; Tissues; Transgenic Mice; valosin-containing protein; Variant; Wild Type Mouse; ","Novel mechanisms mediating cardiac protection upon pressure overload","137962","HM","Hypertension and Microcirculation Study Section ","","","01","248869","144344","393213",""

Clinical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of both short-term and long-term treatment with glucagon for severe forms of HI and continuous subcutaneous administration of glucagon has been recommended both because of the potential improvement in patient outcome and high costs of surgical intervention followed by long-term annual care costs. However, the instability of glucagon in solution creates both administration problems and potential complications due to infusion tube blockage. These instability problems have limited the use of glucagon for severe persistent HI. To overcome this problem, we propose to develop a series of solution stable glucagon analogs and test them both in-vitro and in-vivo. These analogs when formulated in a conventional sterile diluent will maintain not only the standard 95% potency requirement throughout a 2 year storage period at 4ºC but more importantly will offer an extended ?in use? stability period of at least 6 months at 40ºC.

Now soldiers returning from active areas of conflict such as Afghanistan and Iraq, where Pv is highly endemic and accounts for >90% of malaria cases, are still at risk. A recent report demonstrated that 38 out 725 returning soldiers in a deployment in Afghanistan subsequently developed Pv.

There is a dire need to substantially expand knowledge of HIV infection status in the region, and enroll and retain persons with HIV in care. This has both direct benefits to improving the health of those with HIV, but also would significantly prevent new infections. Improved retentio n in HIV care would also make investments in HIV more cost-effective. Against this backdrop, there is also an emerging epidemic of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as diabetes and hypertension, in low- and middle-income countries, and the burden of disease from NCDs is now rivaling that of HIV in many regions. The goal of this study is to test the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a novel integration of diabetes and hypertension screening with HIV testing and explore its impact on increasing the rate of HIV testing. Our pilot data suggests that it may be possible to double the uptake of HIV testing with this low-cost strategy. We will also examine whether NCD care integrated with HIV care will improve retention in HIV care. A large proportion of those entering HIV care in sub-Saharan Africa dropout, especially clients not yet eligible for antiretroviral therapy. Our data show that approximately 79% of new entrants to HIV care also have clinically significant diabetes or hypertension, and integrating N CD care with HIV care hold promise of significantly enhancing retention in HIV care. The interventions we will explore, if found efficacious and cost-effective, would provide needed program and policy guidance highly significant to public health. In addition, if these strategies could also ultimately lead to substantial savings to US programs that address AIDS, diabetes, and hypertension control and treatment.","2020545; ","SWEAT, MICHAEL D;","GREENWOOD, GREGORY ","09/15/2016","06/30/2021","Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Address; Affect; Africa South of the Sahara; AIDS prevention; antiretroviral therapy; Awareness; base; Blood Glucose; Blood Pressure; burden of illness; Caring; Catchment Area; Censuses; Characteristics; Client; Clinic; Clinical; clinically significant; cohort; Communities; community setting; Consult; cost; cost effective; cost effectiveness; Counseling; Country; Data; design; diabetes control; Diabetes Mellitus; Dropout; efficacy testing; Eligibility Determination; Enrollment; Epidemic; Expenditure; experience; Failure; Fatigue; Glycosylated hemoglobin A; Goals; Health; Health Benefit; Health Services Accessibility; HIV; HIV Infections; Household; Human immunodeficiency virus test; Hypertension; hypertension control; hypertension treatment; improved; Incidence; Individual; Infection; interest; Intervention; Investments; Knowledge; Lead; Life; low and middle-income countries; Medical; novel; Patients; Pattern; Persons; Pilot Projects; Policies; Population; Prediabetes syndrome; prehypertension; prevent; Prevention; Probability; programs; Public Health; Quality of life; Randomized; Randomized Controlled Trials; Recording of previous events; rural area; Sampling; Savings; screening; Services; Site; social stigma; Stigmatization; System; Tanzania; Testing; Time; transmission process; treatment center; treatment program; trend; uptake; Viral; Visit; ","Impact of Integrated HIV/NCD Screening on HIV Testing Uptake and Engagement in HIV Care: an RCT in Kisarawe, Tanzania","111366","BSPH","Behavioral and Social Science Approaches to Preventing HIV/AIDS Study Section ","","","02","508989","100960","609949",""

Experiments will test the hypothesis that endoderm cells do not respond to Hedgehog because they lack primary cilia and determine the signals that regulate cilia formation in the gut endoderm, ultimately allowing regulation of cilia formation.

Unfortunately, an effective treatment is still needed. Towards that goal, we are testing a treatment that could improve the long-term outcome after mild traumatic brain injury. We seek to demonstrate the efficacy with a closed head injury model, and this study will also enhance our understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to TBI induced neurodegeneration.

To unravel the principles of information processing in brain circuits, it is essential to have a systematic understanding of its components ? the cell types, and to have tools to monitor and manipulate them in the living brain to probe their roles in the circuits. We will create a first version of a comprehensive cell type atlas for an entire mammalian brain, the mouse brain, which encompasses molecular, anatomical and functional annotations of cell types as a valuable resource to the community towards the understanding of brain function in healthy and diseased states.","7127935; 1955724; 2084503; 8875804; 9250010 (contact); 6139020; ","ANDERSON, DAVID J; NGAI, JOHN J.; PACHTER, LIOR S; TOLIAS, ANDREAS ; ZENG, HONGKUI  (contact); ZHUANG, XIAOWEI ;","YAO, YONG ","09/20/2017","06/30/2022","Address; Adopted; Adult; Alpha Cell; Anatomy; Area; Atlases; base; biological systems; Brain; brain cell; BRAIN initiative; Brain region; Calcium; Cell Count; cell type; Cells; Cellular Structures; Censuses; Chimera organism; Chromium; Classification; Classification Scheme; Collaborations; Collection; Communication; Communities; computerized data processing; CRISPR library; Data; Data Analyses; Data Collection; data management; Data Set; deep sequencing; Disease; Electrophysiology (science); embryonic stem cell; Ensure; Exhibits; Female; fluorescence imaging; Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization; Foundations; Functional Imaging; Future; Gene Expression; Gene Targeting; Generations; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Transcription; Goals; high throughput technology; Image; in vivo; Individual; information processing; innovation; Institutes; intersectionality; Knock-in; Knowledge; Location; male; Maps; Mediating; Methodology; Methods; Modality; Molecular; Monitor; Morphology; multi-photon; Mus; neural circuit; Neuroglia; Neurons; novel; open data; Physiological; Process; Progress Reports; Property; Quality Control; Rabies; Research; Research Infrastructure; Research Personnel; Resolution; Resources; Retina; Role; Sampling; screening; sharing data; Specificity; Standardization; Strategic Planning; Structure; Synapses; System; Techniques; Technology; Testing; Time; tool; transcriptome sequencing; transcriptomics; Transgenic Mice; Work; ","A comprehensive whole-brain atlas of cell types in the mouse","114830","ZMH1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","9381407","4273490","13654897",""

Compared to other vesicants, CX causes bewilderingly rapid effects on the skin, eye and mucus membranes including instant pain and prompt penetration. Even though it is considered the most harmful vesicant with real military and terrorist threat potential that can be used for rapid incapacitation and death, very little is known regarding the toxic effects of CX following its cutaneous exposure and its mechanism of action is unknown. Studies are proposed in this application to address that CX activates inflammatory and p53-DNA damaging pathways that are potential major contributors of CX-induced skin toxic lesions, and that it causes vasculature dilation and blood congestion in multiple organs resulting in systemic toxicity and mortality. Completion of our studies would potentially have a profound impact on understanding the molecular mechanism of CX cutaneous toxicity with significant translational implications towards designing therapeutic intervention strategies.","10294587; ","TEWARI-SINGH, NEERA ;","TSENG, HUNG H","09/21/2017","08/31/2019","absorption; Acute; Address; Allergic; Animal Model; Antidotes; Apoptotic; base; Biological Markers; Blood; Blood Pressure; Bone Marrow; Cell Death; Cell Degranulation; Cessation of life; Chemical Agents; Chemical Warfare Agents; Chemical Weapons; Clinical; Congestive; Cutaneous; cyclooxygenase 2; cytokine; Data; Dermal; design; Development; Dilatation - action; DNA Damage; drug development; Edema; effective therapy; efficacy study; Erythema; Exposure to; Eye; falls; Genes; Goals; Heart; Histamine Release; Human; Hypoxia; in vivo; Inbred HRS Mice; Inflammation; Inflammation Mediators; Inflammatory; Inflammatory Response; Injury; insight; interest; Intervention; Kidney; Lesion; Liver; Lung; mast cell; Measures; Membrane; Military Personnel; Modeling; Molecular; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Mucous body substance; Mus; Mustard; Nature; Necrosis; Neutrophil Infiltration; new therapeutic target; novel; Organ; Outcome; Oximes; Oxygen; Pain; Pathologic; Pathway interactions; Penetration; Peripheral; Peroxidases; Phosgene; Phosphorylation; Property; Pruritus; PTGS2 gene; Publishing; Reaction Time; response; Rodent; Scheme; screening; Signal Transduction Pathway; Skin; Skin injury; skin irritation; Skin Tissue; Spleen; systemic toxicity; Testing; theories; therapeutic candidate; Therapeutic Intervention; therapeutic target; therapy development; Time; Time Study; Tissues; TNF gene; Toxic effect; TP53 gene; Urticaria; vapor; Vesicants; World War II; ","Phosgene Oxime Cutaneous Toxicity and Mechanisms to Identify Therapeutic Targets","073544","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","150000","63825","213825",""

It is possible that the active erasure and the re-establishment of 5mC marks during germ line differentiation and brain development from fetus to young adult involve dynamic changes of 5mC into oxidative marks, and that these modified cytosine residues in DNA are recognized by specific protein readers with distinct roles in the maintenance of epigenetic memory.

Tumors may be located in critical parts of the brain that provide important function such as language or movement. Brian biopsy in these regions carries risk to the patient. A non-invasive means of diagnosing brain tumors would improve the quality of life of patients with this disease by reducing the need for invasive diagnostic procedures. In this study, we will analyze extracellular RNA that is released from brain tumors into blood or cerebrospinal fluid as a means of diagnosing tumors. Going forward, this study will employ our state of the art technologies for analyzing extracellular RNA from patients, with the goal of developing a sensitive but non-invasive means of diagnosing brain tumors. In the final phase of this research, a consortium of 18 leading brain tumor centers will work together to validate this approach in a series of clinical trials.

Informed by over a decade of formative research and programmatic work with MSWs in the United States (and globally), our interdisciplinary investigator team designed the 'PrEPare for Work' package that includes two components: 1) peer-led strengths-based case management for PrEP initiation and 2) once PrEP is initiated, a counseling and problem-solving PrEP adherence intervention that addresses individualized barriers to optimal use. The present NIH grant submission is to pilot test the PrEPare for Work intervention package in a two-stage randomized controlled pilot trial in Providence, Rhode Island, providing preliminary data on acceptability and feasibility, and initial effect size estimates-all laying the groundwork for a future R01 efficacy trial.","10324624; 10733084; 8755422 (contact); ","BIELLO, KATIE BROOKS; CHAN, PHILIP ANDREW; MIMIAGA, MATTHEW JAMES (contact);","STIRRATT, MICHAEL J","09/20/2016","08/31/2019","Address; Adherence; AIDS prevention; Alcohol or Other Drugs use; Anal Sex; antiretroviral therapy; base; Behavior Therapy; Behavioral; Bisexual; Blood; Caring; Case Management; cisgender; Client; Clinic; clinical care; Clinical Trials; Cognitive; Cohort Studies; Complex; Counseling; Country; Data; Decision Making; design; Dose; Drops; efficacy trial; emtricitabine; Ensure; Epidemiology; Evaluation; Evidence based intervention; Face; Focus Groups; follow-up; Future; Gays; Grant; Hair; high risk; HIV; HIV Infections; HIV risk; Homelessness; Hospitals; Individual; Injection of therapeutic agent; innovation; Internet; Intervention; Interview; Life; Life Experience; Link; male; male sex worker; Manuals; Measures; men; men who have sex with men; Mental Depression; Meta-Analysis; Methods; Modality; Oral; Participant; Patient Self-Report; peer; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase; pill; pilot trial; Population; Populations at Risk; pre-clinical; pre-exposure prophylaxis; Prevalence; Preventive Intervention; primary outcome; Problem Solving; Procedures; Process; Professional counselor; programs; psychosocial; public health relevance; Publishing; Questionnaires; Randomized; Randomized Controlled Trials; Research; Research Infrastructure; Research Personnel; Rhode Island; Risk; Sampling; secondary outcome; sex; Site; skills training; standard of care; Subgroup; Surveys; Tenofovir; Testing; theories; Time; Training; transgender women; transmission process; treatment adherence; truvada; Unemployment; United States; United States National Institutes of Health; Universities; uptake; Victimization; Visit; Work; ","Optimizing PrEP uptake & Adherence among MSWs using a 2-stage randomization design","110369","BSPH","Behavioral and Social Science Approaches to Preventing HIV/AIDS Study Section ","","S1","02","50000","25075","75075",""

Dysfunctional cilia have been associated with various pulmonary diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms of cilia formation and airway ciliated cell differentiation is critical for the development of new therapies for cilia-related diseases.

This project recognizes that the Parkinson's brain has undergone pathological changes that result in lowered function in serotonin and norepinephrine neurons, in addition to losses of dopamine neurons. L-DOPA provides relief from the motor symptoms of Parkinson's via its ability to increase brain dopamine. However, effective treatments for the non-motor symptoms do not exist presently. Work in this application will use a novel knockout mouse model that lacks brain serotonin to study the emergence of non-motor symptoms after the loss of dopamine and norepinephrine neurons. 5-HTP and L- DOPS will be used to restore brain serotonin and norepinephrine levels, respectively, and to provide relief from the serious non-motor symptoms that are frequently associated with Parkinson's disease. This project therefore has high relevance to the VA health care mission and to RRD research objectives.","6171401; ","KUHN, DONALD M;","","10/01/2012","06/30/2020","1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine; 5-Hydroxytryptophan; Achievement; Adult; Affect; aged; Agonist; Alzheimer's Disease; Amino Acids; Animal Model; Anxiety; Appearance; Attention; Behavioral; Body Weight; Bradykinesia; Brain; Brain Diseases; Cell Nucleus; Cells; Chronic; Clinical Trials; cognitive testing; Combined Modality Therapy; Complex; Dementia; Development; disability; Disease; Dopamine; dopaminergic neuron; Drug usage; DSP 4; effective therapy; equilibration disorder; Equilibrium; experimental study; General Population; Genes; Genetic Recombination; Goals; health related quality of life; Healthcare; Human; Impairment; Impulse Control Disorders; innovation; interest; Knockout Mice; Laboratories; Lesion; Levodopa; Life Expectancy; Light; Link; LoxP-flanked allele; Mediating; Mental Depression; Minor; Mission; Modeling; Molecular; Monitor; monoamine; Mood Disorders; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Motor; motor deficit; motor symptom; mouse model; Movement; Movement Disorders; Mus; neurochemistry; Neurodegenerative Disorders; Neurologic; neuron loss; Neurons; neuropsychiatry; Neurotoxins; non-motor symptom; noradrenaline transporter; Norepinephrine; novel; novel therapeutic intervention; offspring; Parkinson Disease; Pathologic; Patient Self-Report; Patients; Pharmacological Treatment; Population; posture instability; Process; psychological distress; Quality of life; receptor; Research; restoration; Role; Sensory; Serotonin; serotonin transporter; Sleep; Sleep Disorders; symptomatology; Synapses; System; Tamoxifen; Targeted Toxins; Testing; Therapeutic Effect; Time; TPH2; translational approach; treatment effect; Treatment Efficacy; Tremor; Veterans; virtual; Work; ","Role of TPH2 and 5HT Neuronal Loss in Non-motor Symptoms of Parkinson's","000458","RRD6","Blank ","","","06","","","",""

In this project, we will characterize a novel cell wall response pathway that contributes to decreased caspofungin susceptibility and pathogenesis of candidiasis.

Furthermore, many find that drug side effects are unacceptable. There is a need for new and novel ways to treat epilepsy. 2DG is a new approach to the treatment of epilepsy and is thought that it may work in a way similar to the ketogenic diet, a metabolic treatment that can have antiepileptic effects in patients that have not responded to conventional antiepileptic drugs. 2DG is being evaluated at the NIH to obtain a new investigational drug status. We are investigating the effects of 2DG on a model of epileptic activity in a small slice of brain and defining how this sugar analog alters the excitability of a network of neurons.

Dopamine released from these neurons assists in the learning of goal-oriented behaviors and it mediates the pleasurable effects of drugs of abuse such as morphine and amphetamine. Understanding how the excitability of VTA neurons is regulated is crucial if one is to understand mechanisms that control dopamine release. 5'-Adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a master enzyme that regulates cellular metabolism. Preliminary data from our lab suggest that activators of AMPK reduce VTA neuronal excitability by inhibiting glutamate synaptic input while increasing the function of inhibitory membrane properties. The present research will use neurophysiological methods in rodent tissue to define actions of AMPK on VTA dopamine neurons. Results may suggest new pharmacological strategies for the treatment of mood disorders, learning disorders, and drug abuse.","1864392; ","JOHNSON, STEVEN WILLIAM;","","04/01/2015","03/31/2019","Action Potentials; Adenosine Monophosphate; Affect; AMPA Receptors; Amphetamines; Autoreceptors; Behavior; behavioral sensitization; Biochemical Pathway; Brain; Brain region; Cells; Cognitive; Data; Dependence; desensitization; Diazoxide; disability; Disease; Dopamine; Dopamine D2 Receptor; Dopaminergic Agents; dopaminergic neuron; Drug abuse; drug of abuse; Emotional; Energy Metabolism; Enzymes; experimental study; falls; Generations; Glutamates; goal oriented behavior; Homeostasis; Human; improved; Incubated; Individual; induced pluripotent stem cell; inhibitor/antagonist; interest; Learning; Learning Disorders; Long-Term Potentiation; Mediating; Membrane; Metabolism; Methods; Midbrain structure; Mood Disorders; Morphine; N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors; N-Methylaspartate; Na(+)-K(+)-Exchanging ATPase; neuronal excitability; Neurons; neurophysiology; Output; Peripheral; Pharmacology; Phosphotransferases; Physiologic pulse; Physiology; pleasure; Process; Production; Property; Protein Kinase; public health relevance; Rattus; receptor; receptor sensitivity; Regulation; Reporting; Research; Rewards; Rodent; Role; Second Messenger Systems; sensor; Site; Slice; Structure; Synapses; Synaptic Transmission; Testing; Tissues; transmission process; treatment strategy; Ventral Tegmental Area; Whole-Cell Recordings; ","Regulation of VTA dopamine neurons by AMP kinase","002525","NURB","Neurobiology B ","","","03","","","",""

Identifying neuroimaging biomarkers to detect (diagnosis) and to predict outcome (prognosis) of persistent post-concussive symptoms (PPCS) is an urgent need since it could lead to early intervention strategies prior to the entrenchment of severe symptoms, thus potentially averting disability and enhancing functional outcome. This proposal will develop objective radiological markers for the diagnosis of mTBI using advanced multimodal neuroimaging techniques and a brain atlas will be used to characterize individual profiles of injury (personalized medicine) in both civilian and Veteran populations. The atlas will also be used in a longitudinal study of acute mTBI (scans at 1 week, 3 and 6 months post-injury) to predict recovery versus PPCS. Comparisons will be made to Veterans with blast/no blast injuries (with good and poor outcome) and controls.

Prior research indicates that chiropractic care, increasingly integrated into the VHA system, may have a positive impact. However, chiropractic care has not been studied in the Veterans. In addition, considerable uncertainty exists regarding optimal patterns of chiropractic use. The short-term pain and functional outcomes associated with varying numbers of initial visits, and the long-term effectiveness of chiropractic care within the context of real- world delivery at VHAs, in terms of clinical impact is unknown. In addition, we know very little regarding outcomes resulting from the broader range of evidence-based chiropractic care strategies most commonly practiced in real world settings. Thus, the proposed demonstration project - an appropriately powered multisite RCT specifically designed to rigorously address both of these issues - is highly significant and has the potential to directly impact chiropractic utilization policy within the VHA and beyond, regardless of outcome.","7080563; ","GOERTZ, CHRISTINE MARIE;","REIDER, EVE ","09/20/2017","08/31/2019","Address; Adult; Age; Alcohol consumption; Ambulatory Care; American College of Physicians; Anxiety; arm; Biological Models; Caring; Categories; chiropracty; Chronic; chronic pain; Client satisfaction; Clinical; collaboratory; Comorbidity; comparative effectiveness; cost; cost effective; design; Diagnosis; disability; Doctor of Chiropractic; Dose; Effectiveness; Evaluation; evidence base; Expenditure; functional outcomes; functional restoration; Health; health administration; health service use; Health Services; Hospitalization; Injection of therapeutic agent; Intervention; Intervention Studies; Knowledge; Life; Low Back Pain; Low Prevalence; Measures; Mental Depression; Mental Health; Methods; Modification; multimodality; Musculoskeletal Diseases; Operative Surgical Procedures; Opiate Addiction; Opioid; Outcome; outcome prediction; Pain; Pain intensity; Pain interference; Pain management; Participant; Patients; Pattern; Perception; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase; Physical therapy; Policies; Population; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders; Preparation; primary outcome; Process; Productivity; productivity loss; Provider; Quality of life; Questionnaires; Randomized Controlled Trials; randomized trial; Recommendation; Reporting; Research; Research Infrastructure; Research Personnel; Resources; Risk; Schedule; secondary outcome; Services; Site; Societies; Spinal Manipulation; System; systematic review; treatment as usual; treatment duration; Treatment Factor; treatment group; Uncertainty; United States National Institutes of Health; Veterans; Visit; Woman; Work; ","Chiropractic Care for Veterans: A Pragmatic Randomized Trial Addressing Dose Effects for cLBP","009761","ZAT1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","565460","172659","738119",""

From 2006-2010, 19% of the cases of meningococcal infection were fatal and 58% were vaccine failures. For gonorrhea, the U.S. rate remains high with ~820,000 new cases per year and antibiotic resistance is acutely problematic. Importantly, gonococcal infection is known to facilitate the transmission of HIV-1 infection. The high-risk environment of active military service is thought to  increase risky behavior and, thus, the rate of sexually transmitted infections. Military and Veteran females, who incur a rate of gonorrhea that is higher than for civilian females and who suffer more frequent and serious complications than men, represent 15% of active duty military personnel and 2 million Veterans.

Although the injured nerves can regenerate, function rarely returns to normal; a large majority of those injured are left with permanent deficits in motor skills. One of the major reasons for these deficits is that nerve injuries disrupt the spinal cord reflex pathways that are important in motor control. Novel therapies that can appropriately modify these abnormal spinal cord pathways are needed. Operant conditioning protocols can modify spinal cord reflex pathways; and can thereby improve walking in animals or people with spinal cord injuries. Furthermore, preliminary data suggest that these protocols can also improve walking that has been impaired by a peripheral nerve injury. The goal of this proposal is to validate reflex operant conditioning as a new therapeutic method that can compliment standard rehabilitation regimens and enhance the recovery of useful function for patients with peripheral nerve injuries.","1882565; ","WOLPAW, JONATHAN RICKEL;","","07/01/2014","06/30/2018","Address; Affect; American; analog; Animals; Axon; Axotomy; base; Behavior; brain pathway; Clinical; clinical translation; conditioning; Data; Data Collection; Disease; Electrodes; functional disability; functional outcomes; Goals; H-Reflex; Hip region structure; Human; Impairment; Implant; improved; improved functioning; injured; kinematics; Knee; Label; Left; Length; Locomotion; Locomotor Recovery; Measures; Methods; Motor; motor control; motor deficit; motor function improvement; Motor Neurons; Motor Skills; Muscle; Muscle Spindles; Musculoskeletal System; Natural regeneration; Nerve; nerve injury; Nerve Regeneration; nerve transection; Neuronal Plasticity; novel; novel therapeutics; Operant Conditioning; Pathway interactions; Patients; Peripheral; Peripheral nerve injury; peripheral nerve regeneration; Physiological; Posterior Tibial Nerves; Presynaptic Terminals; Protocols documentation; public health relevance; Rattus; Recovery; Recovery of Function; Reflex action; Regimen; Rehabilitation therapy; reinnervation; repaired; restoration; sciatic nerve; Soleus Muscle; Spinal; Spinal Cord; Spinal cord injury; spinal reflex; Sprague-Dawley Rats; stretch reflex; Sum; Synapses; Testing; Therapeutic; tibialis anterior muscle; treadmill; vesicular glutamate transporter 1; Veterans; Walking; Work; ","Operant Conditioning of Spinal Reflexes to Improve Function after Nerve Injury","002550","NURC","Neurobiology C ","","","04","","","",""

Yet, relatively little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying our ability to tell time, and it is increasingly clear that this represents a bottleneck for our understanding of the neural basis of learning, behavior, and neurological disorders. Thus elucidating both normal and pathological brain function will require that we unveil the mechanisms that allow the brain to tell time.

Half of patients with major depression disorder (MDD) are misdiagnosed, indicating a tremendous need for an objective, simple test that could confirm or rule out whether a patient with depressive or anxious symptoms has clinical major depression. In addition to difficulty in diagnosis, treatment of MDD also poses significant obstacles. Only about one third of patients achieve remission from their initial course of treatment, and treatment and clinical improvement requires 6-8 weeks before evident. Pax Neuroscience has established assays that can accurately detect MDD. This proposal builds on those assays in two major ways. First these studies will be converted to high throughput format that will discover novel compounds. Second, the assay used to validate our screen can be used to predict treatment efficacy in MDD patients. !","1860545; ","RASENICK, MARK M.;","GRABB, MARGARET C.","09/20/2017","08/31/2019","accurate diagnosis; Address; Adenoviruses; Adenylate Cyclase; American; Antidepressive Agents; anxiety symptoms; Area; base; Behavior Therapy; Binding; Biological Assay; Biological Markers; biosignature; Blood Tests; Cell Line; Cells; Cellular Membrane; Clinical; clinical diagnostics; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials; commercialization; Comorbidity; Computer software; cost; Coupling; Data; Depressed mood; depressive symptoms; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; Diagnosis; Diagnostic; diagnostic biomarker; Diagnostic tests; disability; Disease remission; Enrollment; Escitalopram; experimental study; Failure; Fibroblasts; Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching; Funding; G-substrate; Glioma; glioma cell line; Goals; GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs; GTP-Binding Proteins; Heart Diseases; Human; Image Analysis; Impairment; improved outcome; individualized medicine; innovation; Knowledge; Legal patent; Libraries; Major Depressive Disorder; Medical; Medical Economics; Membrane Microdomains; Mental Depression; Mental disorders; Modeling; Molecular Target; Mood Disorders; Movement; mutant; National Institute of Mental Health; nerve stem cell; Neuroblastoma; Neurons; Neurosciences; novel; novel therapeutics; Pathway interactions; patient population; Patient-Focused Outcomes; Patients; personalized medicine; personalized therapeutic; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacologic Substance; Physicians; Population; preclinical study; predicting response; primary care setting; protein biomarkers; Recovery; Recruitment Activity; response; Retreatment; Running; Sampling; scaffold; Schizophrenia; screening; serotonin transporter; Services; Small Business Innovation Research Grant; small molecule; social; Source; Study models; suicidal risk; Technology; Testing; Therapeutic; Time; Transgenes; Treatment Efficacy; treatment response; United States National Institutes of Health; Work; World Health Organization; ","Using a novel model of antidepressant efficacy to discover new compounds and personalized treatments.","113398","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","01","","","399488",""

Identification of individuals at elevated risk of developing the disease will provide more information about risk factors, leading to a better understanding of disease pathogenesis. The conduct of trials in individuals recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes will provide important insights into the safety of new drugs and their ability to preserve insulin secretary capability. This proposal addresses support of trials for new onset cases of diabetes and the design and implementation of mechanistic studies to add to our understanding of mechanisms that contribute to ?responders? versus ?non-responders?.. Enrolling at-risk individuals in intervention studies to test treatments intended to delay or prevent the onset of type 1 diabetes and enrolling newly diagnosed individuals in intervention studies to test treatments intended to preserve remaining insulin secretion may result in new strategies to prevent, delay or reverse T1DM. A better understanding of the characteristics or biomarkers that distinguish responders may allow more targeted intervention strategies. This project will enrich this process by supporting new approaches to the design and conduct of new- onset trials and mechanistic investigations. The TrialNet Coordinating Center will contribute to the design of new protocols to replace existing studies or to target new populations (such as individuals diagnosed asymptomatically) with new and innovative end points. Funds are also requested for operations to maintain study protocols, provide project oversight, coordination, communication, statistical analyses, quality control and capability to collect longitudinal data and results of laboratory analyses of biological specimens from individuals at-risk for diabetes.","1962659; ","KRISCHER, JEFFREY P;","LESCHEK, ELLEN W","09/22/2017","06/30/2022","Address; Adherence; Award; Beta Cell; Biological; Biological Markers; Biometry; Characteristics; Clinical; clinical research site; Clinical Trials; Committee Members; Communication; Conduct Clinical Trials; Contracts; cost effectiveness; Data; Data Analyses; Data Collection; Data Coordinating Center; data management; Data Quality; design; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetes prevention; diabetes risk; Diagnosis; Disease; Enrollment; Ensure; Epidemiology; Florida; follow-up; Funding; Future; Goals; Grant; Individual; innovation; insight; Insulin; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus onset; insulin secretion; Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; Intervention; Intervention Studies; Investigation; Laboratories; Lead; Maintenance; Manuals; meetings; Methodology; Monitor; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases; Newly Diagnosed; novel strategies; novel therapeutics; operation; Paper; Pathogenesis; Periodicity; Population; Preparation; prevent; Prevention; Preventive Intervention; Procedures; Process; protocol development; Protocols documentation; Publications; Quality Control; Questionnaires; Records; Recruitment Activity; Reporting; repository; Request for Applications; Research; research study; responders and non-responders; response; Risk; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Safety; Sampling; Site; Specimen; Statistical Data Interpretation; symposium; System; Testing; trial design; Universities; Update; ","Data Coordinating Center for Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet (UC4)  USF: TrialNet UC4-3","117009","ZDK1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","34051989","8594182","42646171",""

The goals of this project are to elucidate the molecular details of how ALLINIs block binding of IN to viral RNAs, how IN-RNA interactions regulate particle maturation and utilize eccentric particles as a tool to gain a better understanding of the early viral post-entry steps.","10418149; ","KUTLUAY, SEBLA B.;","SAKALIAN, MICHAEL ","01/01/2017","11/30/2021","Adverse event; Affect; Anti-Retroviral Agents; base; Binding; Biochemical; Biological Assay; Capsid; Cells; Clinical; Clinical Trials; cofactor; Complementary DNA; Complex; crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing; Databases; Defect; design; Development; Drug resistance; Electron Microscopy; Elements; Enzymes; Event; Genome; Goals; HIV-1; HIV-1 integrase; Impairment; Infection; inhibitor/antagonist; innovation; insight; Integrase; Integrase Inhibitors; Lead; Methodology; Molecular; Molecular Biology; Morphology; mutant; Mutation; novel; particle; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Play; Positioning Attribute; prevent; Process; Property; Proteins; prototype; pyridine; quinoline; Regulation; Research; Resistance; Reverse Transcription; Ribonucleoproteins; RNA; RNA Binding; RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase; Role; Structure; Testing; Time; tool; transcriptional coactivator p75; TRIM5 gene; Vaccines; Variant; Viral; Viral Genome; viral RNA; Viral Vector; Virion; Virus Integration; virus morphology; Virus Replication; Virus-like particle; ","REGULATION AND TARGETING OF HIV-1 INTEGRASE-RNA INTERACTIONS","122458","","","","S1","01","50000","","50000",""

NMDA receptor mediates calcium current controls intracellular molecular cascades that determine the fate of synapses and cells. While the human health role of the NMDA receptor is important, our understanding of its dynamics and function is still obscured. Governed by the conformational dynamics of the protein, the precise and complex kinetic behavior of the channel is critical for the execution of cognitive functions and brain development. It is therefore of great importance to understand the conformational dynamics that underlie the NMDA receptor kinetic behavior. Abnormal activation of the NMDA receptor under pathological conditions leads to cell-death, and plays a role in the etiology of several neurodegenerative diseases. The NMDA receptor has been the target for the development of antagonists as therapeutic drugs. Analysis of the NMDA receptor is therefore highly relevant to public health.","7809180; ","LU, H PETER;","DEATHERAGE, JAMES F.","09/01/2012","08/31/2018","Agonist; Behavior; Binding; Binding Sites; Biological Models; Biological Process; Biological Sciences; Brain; Calcium; Cell Death; Cell membrane; Cell physiology; Cells; Cellular biology; cognitive function; Complex; desensitization; Detection; Development; Diagnostic; Dissociation; drug development; Electrophysiology (science); Etiology; extracellular; Extracellular Domain; Fluorescence; fluorescence imaging; Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer; Goals; Health; Human; Immune System Diseases; innovation; Ion Channel; Ion Channel Protein; Kinetics; Knowledge; Ligands; Measurement; Measures; Mediating; Medical; Medical Research; Methodology; microscopic imaging; millisecond; Molecular; Molecular Conformation; Motion; N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors; nanosecond; Neurodegenerative Disorders; Neurons; patch clamp; Pathologic; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Play; Property; Protein Conformation; Protein Dynamics; Proteins; Public Health; receptor; receptor function; Research; Research Personnel; Resolution; response; Role; Science; Shapes; single molecule; Site; spectroscopic imaging; Structural Protein; Structure; success; Synapses; System; Techniques; Therapeutic; Time; ","Single-Molecule Patch-Clamp FRET Imaging Microscopy in Living Cells","098089","ISD","Instrumentation and Systems Development Study Section ","","S1","04","68160","28627","96787",""

The work will be highly aided by obtaining skin biopsies and diseased lung tissue from patients undergoing lung transplantation. Several hypotheses will be studied. By blocking specific signaling pathways that regulate cell differentiation, project scientists will seek to better understand how genes control scarring, white blood cells and blood vessel cells in these patients. Inhibitors that block disease-mediating pathways in tissues from SSc patients will be strong candidates to target with new medications.","1858978; ","LAFYATIS, ROBERT A.;","WANG, YAN Z.","09/01/2011","08/31/2022","Academic Medical Centers; Affect; Animal Model; Automobile Driving; Autopsy; Biogenesis; Bioinformatics; Biological; biological adaptation to stress; Biological Markers; Biological Models; Biology; Biopsy; Blood Vessels; Boston; Cardiac Catheterization Procedures; Catheters; Cell Differentiation process; Cell model; Cells; Cicatrix; Clinical; collaborative environment; Complement; Connective Tissue; Data; data integration; Data Set; Dermal; design; Development; Disease; Disease Pathway; disorder subtype; Distal; drug development; Endothelial Cells; experience; Fibroblasts; Fibrosis; Fumarates; gene discovery; Gene Expression; Gene Proteins; Genes; genetic regulatory protein; Goals; Grant; Heterogeneity; Human; human tissue; In Vitro; inhibitor/antagonist; Injury; innovation; Integrins; Interstitial Lung Diseases; ITGA11 gene; Lead; Leukocytes; Lung; Lung diseases; Lung Transplantation; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; Medical center; medical schools; Mesenchymal; Messenger RNA; Mitochondria; Modeling; Molecular; multicatalytic endopeptidase complex; Myofibroblast; Myography; novel; novel therapeutics; Observational Study; Organ; Oxidative Stress; Pain; Pathogenesis; Pathogenicity; Pathway Analysis; Pathway interactions; Patients; Perfusion; Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phenotype; Population; Population Analysis; Pre-Clinical Model; predicting response; predictive marker; progenitor; Prognostic Marker; programs; Proteomics; Protocols documentation; pulmonary arterial hypertension; pulmonary artery endothelial cell; Pulmonary artery structure; Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship; Regulation; repository; Research Personnel; Resources; Sampling; Scientist; Serum; Serum Markers; Signal Pathway; Skin; skin disorder; skin fibrosis; Specimen; Structure of parenchyma of lung; System; Systemic Scleroderma; Systems Biology; targeted treatment; Technology; Testing; Tissues; tool; transcriptome; transcriptome sequencing; translational genomics; translational medicine; Translational Research; translational study; Treatment Efficacy; Ubiquitin; ubiquitin ligase; ubiquitin-protein ligase; Universities; Vascular Endothelial Cell; Vasodilator Agents; Work; ","Translational studies for identifying and targeting novel pathways in systemic sclerosis pathogenesis","060780","ZAR1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","06","964722","344602","1309324",""

Responsive to androgen ablation therapy initially, almost all patients progress to a castration resistant stage, for which no effective treatment is available. Next generation anti-androgens such as enzalutamide, though they provide overall survival benefit to patients, have already begun to show clinical signs of acquired or primary resistance. The biomarker universally used in prostate cancer screening, PSA, does not predict these outcomes effectively. In this research proposal, we hypothesize that the loss of a microRNA (Let-7c) accompanied by gain of its master regulator (Lin28) may be a potential predictor of therapy resistant progression of prostate cancer. If successful, this project will have a major impact on PCa research and lead to the potential development of a reliable biomarker.

Improper management of these changes can lead to underdosage of the target and/or overdosage of neighboring healthy tissues. Deformable image registration (DIR) is an emerging technology for managing these changes in modern radiation therapy. Experimental assessment of DIR is a critical necessity before it may be used to inform clinical decision making. However, current methods of DIR assessment focus on morphological consistency but not on the physiological validity of the entire deformation. The proposed research will develop and evaluate a unique MRI technique using inhaled hyperpolarized gas as a contrast agent for assessing DIR algorithms and their radiation therapy applications in the lung. The results of the study will lend new insights into the complexities of regional pulmonary biomechanics and enrich our understanding of the promise and potential pitfalls of DIR. Ultimately this unique technology will improve our ability to more precisely deliver radiation treatment to lung tumor and mitigate radiation-induced injury to surrounding normal tissues, thereby improving radiation therapy of lung cancer.","10798332 (contact); 8663028; ","CAI, JING  (contact); MILLER, G.

This proposal examines a new approach for neurological restoration using translational pharmacology with the neuroprotective agent VPA. This agent is hypothesized to produce pro-cognitive effects in TBI/PTSD by reversing neuroinflammatory changes and degeneration and restoring axonal and dendritic connections. This animal project prepares the way for a more rapid translation into the clinical setting. Relevance to Veterans Health: The research relates to the RR&D Priority Area of Chronic TBI. This study will investigate the mechanisms of brain injury and also the cognitive deficits and the inability to extinguish fear found in TBI/PTSD.

Although MS is inherently high throughput, sample preparation is slow and costly. The significance of this proposal is in making high quality MS based immunoassays widely available to the life science world by eliminating conventional sample preparation laboratories and reducing analysis costs 10X.  This will be achieved by advances in sample collection, preparation, and throughput that circumvent conventional mode of preparing samples for LC-MS; among the more innovative being 1) a miniature membrane laboratory bearing 2) nanoparticulate analyte sequestering transport particles that select clusters of targeted biomarkers and rapidly transport them through 3) mobile sorbent affinity chromatography (MASC) to an MS. The net effect of implementing these technologies is that superior MS assay methods will be costs competitive with conventional immunoassays.","14175894; 1862080 (contact); ","KIM, JINHEE ; REGNIER, FRED E (contact);","SHEELEY, DOUGLAS ","03/01/2016","08/31/2019","Affinity; Affinity Chromatography; Aliquot; Antibodies; base; Biological Assay; Biological Markers; Biological Sciences; Blood; C-reactive protein; Cells; Chromatography; clinical diagnostics; Clinical Research; Collection; Complex; cost; Cost Analysis; Coupled; Data; Detection; detector; Diagnostic; Dissociation; Drops; drug testing; Excision; Fingers; Fluorescence; Funding; Goals; GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs; Immunoassay; Immunology procedure; In Situ; innovation; instrument; instrumentation; interest; ionization; Laboratories; Mass Spectrum Analysis; Medicine; Membrane; Methods; Molecular Conformation; nanoparticulate; particle; Performance; Phase; Plasma; Post-Translational Protein Processing; Preparation; Protein Analysis; Proteins; Protocols documentation; Recovery; Research; Resolution; reversed phase chromatography; Route; sample collection; Sampling; Series; Solvents; Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization; Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization; Structure; Surface; System; targeted biomarker; Techniques; Technology; Time; tool; Variant; ","SAMPLE PREPARATION; The Achilles Heel of Mass Spectrometry Based Diagnostics II.","116663","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","02","","","749570",""

While most weight loss agents rely on suppressing appetite to reduce caloric intake, increasing energy expenditure is another approach to weight control. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a recruitable, thermogenic tissue with the capacity to utilize large amounts of fat and glucose, and which is present in reduced amounts in obese patients. We discovered a human BAT progenitor/stem cell and have used this as a tool to discover a protein factor that promotes the recruitment of additional BAT cells, in the process inducing marked improvements in body weight and glucose in Diet-Induced Obese mice. Here we propose to generate and test longer lasting analogs of this protein with similar or greater efficacy in a highly predictive animal model of obesity and insulin resistance. In doing so we anticipate that this work could identify a potential product candidate that can advance into clinical studies, with the aim of increasing brown fat and treating obesity in patients.","10322520; ","BOSS, OLIVIER ;","LI, YAN ","09/18/2017","08/31/2018","Acute; Adipocytes; Adult; analog; Animal Model; Animals; Area; Atrophic; Biological; Biological Assay; Biology; blood glucose regulation; Body fat; Body Temperature; Body Weight; Body Weight decreased; Brown Fat; C-terminal; Cardiovascular Diseases; cell bank; Cells; Chimeric Proteins; Chinese Hamster Ovary Cell; Chronic; Clinical Research; Code; comparative; cost effective; Desire for food; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; Diet; DNA; Dose; Drug Design; Drug Kinetics; drug testing; efficacy testing; energy balance; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Engineering; Epidemic; Fatty acid glycerol esters; flexibility; Formulation; Genetic; Genetic Transcription; Glucose; glucose metabolism; Goals; Half-Life; Hour; Human; human data; Hybrids; immunogenicity; Immunoglobulin G; In Vitro; in vitro activity; in vitro Assay; in vivo; Individual; Injectable; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Lead; Length; Life; Life Extension; Link; lipid biosynthesis; Maintenance; Metabolic Diseases; metabolic rate; Mitochondria; mitochondrial uncoupling protein; Mus; Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; Normal tissue morphology; novel; Obese Mice; Obesity; obesity treatment; oral glucose tolerance; paracrine; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Plasma; Play; Population; Positron-Emission Tomography; preclinical study; Process; progenitor; Proteins; Recruitment Activity; Research; Resistance; Risk; Role; Science; Series; Serum; Skeletal Muscle; species difference; Stem cells; subcutaneous; System; Technology; Temperature; Testing; Therapeutic; therapeutic protein; Thermogenesis; Thinness; Time; Tissues; tool; Toxic effect; uncoupling protein 1; Variant; Weight; Weight maintenance regimen; Weight-Loss Drugs; Work; ","Optimization and Pre-Clinical Studies of a Protein Therapeutic for Recruiting Brown Adipocytes","113877","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","01","","","793958",""

In this investigation, we will determine whether the novel tracer 18F-fluorothymidine (FLT) combined with CT (FLT-PET/CT) is superior in this setting. The demonstration of superiority of FLT-PET/CT over FDG-PET/CT is expected to lead to greater confidence in using interim PET in patient management potentially rendering repeat biopsy unnecessary for midtherapy treatment decisions.

While insulin injections allow a person with T1D to stay alive, they do not cure the disease, nor do they prevent the possibility of the disease's serious effects, which may include: kidney failure, blindness, nerve damage, heart attack, stroke, and pregnancy complications. Thus, there is a need to develop novel strategies aimed to block ? cell mass and restore in vivo ? cells function and number.

However imaging of the occipital lobe is also required with PD for calculation of the striatal uptake ratio, a parameter of significance in the differentiation of PD from other disorder with similar clinical presentations. Our hypothesis is that combining a specifically designed multi- pinhole (MPH) collimator on one detector head with a fan-beam collimator on the remaining head of current SPECT systems, coupled with iterative reconstruction with modeling system spatial resolution will result in improved detection and quantification of structures in the interior region of the brain at marginal cost (price of collimator(s) and software). This would greatly impact the early detection and differentiation of PD, and potentially other neurological disorders as new SPECT imaging agents are approved. The improved resolution could enable the use of new relative quantification strategies which could further improve detection and tracking. It would also serve as an example of what could be accomplished with MPH collimators designed for other clinical procedures.","1901567; ","KING, MICHAEL A;","SASTRE, ANTONIO ","05/18/2016","02/29/2020","Address; Air; Algorithms; Arizona; attenuation; base; Beds; Binding; Biological Models; bone imaging; Brain; Brain imaging; Brain region; Breast; Calibration; Clinic; Clinical; Collimator; Computer software; Corpus striatum structure; cost; Coupled; Data; density; design; design and construction; Detection; detector; Development; Diagnosis; Discipline of Nuclear Medicine; Disease; Early Diagnosis; Financial compensation; Funding; Gamma Rays; Geometry; Goals; Head; Image; Imagery; imaging agent; Imaging Techniques; improved; Individual; innovation; interest; irradiation; Label; Location; Measurement; Measures; Methodology; Monitor; Monte Carlo Method; Morphologic artifacts; Motion; nervous system disorder; novel; Occipital lobe; operation; Parkinson Disease; Patients; Penetration; perfusion imaging; Photons; Positron-Emission Tomography; Price; Procedures; public health relevance; putamen; reconstruction; Resolution; response; Rotation; Safety; Sampling; Security; simulation; Structure; Substantia nigra structure; System; Testing; Thick; Thyroid Gland; Time; Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon; ultra high resolution; United States National Institutes of Health; Universities; uptake; Validation; Weight; Wireless Technology; ","Combined Multi-Pinhole and Fan-Beam Brain SPECT","022092","BMIT","Biomedical Imaging Technology Study Section ","","S1","02","120667","40801","161468",""

The Center is a hub for promoting discovery through its research, education and training, clinical care, statewide outreach programs and networks for community participatory research. The Center connects scientists, healthcare professionals, and communities to translate its discoveries to cancer clinical trials, and cancer control and behavioral interventions that reduce the cancer burden of New Mexico and serve as a national model. The goal of the Center is to assure that all of the people in New Mexico, its catchment area, have access to high quality cancer care and collaborate in and benefit from advances in cancer research.","1955861; ","WILLMAN, CHERYL L.;","PTAK, KRZYSZTOF ","09/26/2005","08/31/2020","Address; Adolescent and Young Adult; Advisory Committees; Aftercare; American Indians; anticancer research; Area; base; behavior measurement; Behavior Therapy; Behavioral; Bone Marrow Stem Cell Transplantation; Cancer Biology; Cancer Burden; cancer care; Cancer Center; Cancer Center Support Grant; cancer clinical trial; Cancer Control; Cancer Control Research; Cancer Control Research Program; cancer genetics; cancer health disparity; Cancer Intervention; Cancer Research Project; Cancer Survivorship; cancer therapy; care delivery; Catchment Area; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.); Cervical; cervical cancer prevention; Characteristics; Clinic; Clinical; clinical care; Clinical Research; clinical translation; Collaborations; Colorectal Cancer; Communities; community intervention; Community Networks; Comprehensive Cancer Center; cooking; Cultural Diversity; design; Development; Diagnosis; Diagnostic; Direct Costs; Doctor of Philosophy; Early Diagnosis; Endometrial Carcinoma; Epigenetic Process; Etiology; Evaluation; Faculty; Fostering; Funding; gene environment interaction; Genetic; Genomics; Geography; Goals; graduate student; Health; Health Professional; Health system; Healthcare Systems; Hispanics; Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination; Improve Access; improved; Incidence; Informatics; Institutes; Institution; Interdisciplinary Study; Intervention; Intervention Studies; Laboratories; laboratory facility; Latino; Life Style; malignant breast neoplasm; Malignant neoplasm of lung; Malignant Neoplasms; medically underserved; melanoma; member; Mentors; Mexican; Mission; Modeling; Molecular Epidemiology; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; mortality disparity; National Cancer Institute; neuro-oncology; New Mexico; Not Hispanic or Latino; novel; Oncologist; Oncology Group; Outcome; Outcome Study; outreach program; Pattern; Peer Review; Pharmacology; Phase; Physicians; Population; Population Sciences; Prevention; Prevention strategy; Primary carcinoma of the liver cells; programs; Provider; Publications; Pueblo Race; Race; ranpirnase; Recruitment Activity; Registries; Research; research facility; Research Institute; Research Personnel; Research Support; Research Training; Resource Sharing; Resources; respiratory; Risk; Risk Reduction; risk variant; Schools; Science; Scientific Advances and Accomplishments; Scientist; screening; Signal Transduction; social; Social Identification; socioeconomics; Surveillance Program; survivorship; synergism; targeted delivery; Technology; telehealth; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Clinical Trial; Therapeutic Intervention; Training; Training and Education; Training Programs; Translating; Treatment outcome; Tribes; tumor; undergraduate student; Underrepresented Minority; Underserved Population; United States Indian Health Service; Universities; Work; working group; ","University of New Mexico Cancer Center Support Grant","118100","NCI","Subcommittee I - Transistion to Independence ","","S6","13","159722","82257","241979",""

The weakness associated with sarcopenia contributes to falls and fractures, frailty, deconditioning and institutionalization and the consequent decline in physical function also contributes to obesity and diabetes. All of these are major problems in older veterans (falls, fractures, frailty, institutionalization, obesity and diabetes) and all could be significantly prevented/improved if one targets sarcopenia. Sarcopenia is a highly relevant problem for the veteran population, as almost half (44%) of the veteran population is older than 65 years of age and 56% of veterans are over age 60 (http://www.va.gov/vetdata/Veteran_Population.asp)). As long as the underlying causes of the muscle atrophy, declining strength and physical frailty that occur with age are not known, it will be difficult to design effective interventions. The studies w have proposed will provide important new insights into targets for interventions to prevent or reduce muscle atrophy during aging.","2097336; ","VAN REMMEN, HOLLY ;","","04/01/2014","09/30/2018","Address; Affect; Age; age related; Age-Years; Aging; Agrin; antioxidant enzyme; Atrophic; Calpain; Chickens; Cholinergic Receptors; copper zinc superoxide dismutase; Data; deconditioning; Degenerative Disorder; design; Deterioration; Diabetes Mellitus; disability; effective intervention; egg; Elderly; Employee Strikes; Exhibits; falls; Fracture; frailty; Gene Expression; Generations; Health Care Costs; Human; improved; Independent Living; insight; Institutionalization; Intervention; Knockout Mice; Knowledge; Laboratories; Living Costs; Maintenance; Measures; Mitochondria; Modeling; Modification; Morphology; Motor Neurons; mouse model; multicatalytic endopeptidase complex; Mus; Muscle; Muscle Fibers; muscle form; Muscle function; Muscle Proteins; Muscle Weakness; Muscular Atrophy; Nerve; nerve supply; Neuromuscular Junction; Neurons; Obesity; Oxidative Stress; Pathway interactions; Peptide Hydrolases; Performance; Peripheral; Phenotype; Physical Function; Physically Handicapped; Play; Population; postsynaptic; presynaptic; presynaptic neurons; prevent; Process; programs; public health relevance; Quality of life; Reporting; response; Role; sarcopenia; Side; Site; Skeletal Muscle; Stress; Structure; superoxide dismutase 1; Superoxides; Testing; Tissues; Transgenes; Veterans; Wild Type Mouse; ","Testing the mechanisms by which NMJ disruption contributes to sarcopenia","002595","NURB","Neurobiology B ","","","04","","","",""

We hypothesize that both amplification of MYCN and loss of  chromosome 1p create unique vulnerabilities to therapy, including immunotherapy. We propose to identify  therapeutic vulnerabilities driven by 1p deletion, and to identify targeted therapies that cooperate with  immunotherapy in the treatment of MYCN-driven neuroblastoma with the goal of improving survival and  decreasing morbidity for children with this deadly disease. This proposal also addresses at least three of the  NIH's ?provocative questions? in pediatric oncology including what vulnerabilities can be identified through  CRISPR screens, what are the effects of losses of large segments of the chromosome, and how can mouse  models define the effects of therapy on normal tissues.","1940040; ","WEISS, WILLIAM A;","","","","Address; Affect; base; Biological Models; Biology; Blood Vessels; Cells; Child; chromosome 1p loss; Chromosome Arm; Chromosome Deletion; chromosome loss; Chromosomes; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1; Clinical; Combined Modality Therapy; conventional therapy; CRISPR screen; CRISPR/Cas technology; Cytometry; Cytotoxic Chemotherapy; Diagnosis; Disease; disorder risk; Distal; Distant; Embryonal Neoplasms; Engineering; Epigenetic Process; Event; experience; Family; FRAP1 gene; Gene Order; Genes; Genetic Transcription; Genetically Engineered Mouse; Goals; high dimensionality; high risk; Human; human stem cells; Immune; Immune Checkpoint; Immune response; Immune system; Immune Targeting; Immunocompetent; Immunologic Markers; Immunotherapy; improved; in vivo; in vivo Model; induced pluripotent stem cell; Infiltration; inhibitor/antagonist; innovation; Lesion; loss of function; lymph nodes; Malignant Childhood Neoplasm; Measures; Modeling; Monoclonal Antibodies; Morbidity - disease rate; mouse model; Mus; MYCN gene; neoplastic cell; Neural Crest Cell; Neuroblastoma; Normal tissue morphology; Oncogenes; Pathway interactions; PDCD1LG1 gene; Pediatric Oncology; Penetrance; Point Mutation; Positioning Attribute; precision medicine; preclinical development; Preclinical Testing; Proteins; Proteomics; Reagent; Regulation; Resistance; response biomarker; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Signaling Molecule; small molecule; small molecule inhibitor; standard of care; STK6 gene; Surface; System; targeted biomarker; targeted treatment; Technology; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapy Clinical Trials; Tissues; transcription factor; Transgenic Mice; Transplantation; tumor; tumor microenvironment; United States National Institutes of Health; ","Exploiting Therapeutic Vulnerabilities","217959","ZCA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","5992","","01","240963","87170","","328133"

We propose to help transfer such technology by validating the Turkish- PAINReportIt® in a study of patients with lung cancer pain from their lung surgery. We expect to discover some barriers that can be addressed and facilitators for successful implementation of this technology in cancer research and practice in Turkey.

STING and IRF3 play essential roles activating pro-apoptotic signaling in hepatocytes after acute or chronic ethanol injury. However, the mechanisms involved upstream of STING and IRF3 activation in early alcoholic liver disease are not known. For this reason, I will explore the mechanism whereby cyclic dinucleotides, the only known ligands that activate STING, lead to IRF3 activation after ethanol-induced liver injury. I propose research with the goal of detection of cyclic dinucleotides in vivo using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Moreover, cyclic dinucleotides have not been previously identified as mediators of sterile liver injury and have not been previously implicated in alcoholic liver disease. We show for the first time a pathogenic role of cGAS in parenchymal cells. Futhermore, gap junction biology has been implicated in liver injuries but this is the first study into their role in mediating propagation of inflammation and cell death in murine models of alcoholic liver disease. Lastly, I propose the use of small molecule inhibitors and viral vector-mediated gene transfer as means to therapeutically target bacterial diguanylate cyclase and its cyclic dinucleotides, respectively, in the treatment of early alcoholic liver disease.  Here, I hypothesize that the cyclic dinucleotides CDs, such as 2'3'-cGAMP and/or c-di-GMP, synthesized by cGAS or bacterial diguanylate cyclase, respectively, directly activate STING and IRF3 in early ALD. Furthermore, I hypothesize that CDs spread via hepatic gap junctions which allows for amplification of innate immune signaling in an alcohol-induced liver injury.","11867147; ","IRACHETA-VELLVE, ARVIN ;","WANG, JOE ","09/21/2016","09/20/2019","Acute; alcohol exposure; alcohol testing; Alcoholic Liver Diseases; Analytical Chemistry; Animals; antimicrobial; Apoptosis; Apoptotic; Bacteria; base; Biology; Cell Death; Cells; Cessation of life; Chronic; Communication; Cyclic GMP; cytokine; Data; Dependovirus; Detection; diguanylate cyclase; Dinucleoside Phosphates; ds-DNA; Early treatment; Endoplasmic Reticulum; Ethanol; Event; Gap Junctions; Gene Activation; gene therapy; Genes; Genetic Transcription; Goals; gut microbiome; Hepatic; Hepatocyte; Hour; Immune; Immune signaling; In Vitro; in vivo; Inflammation; Inflammatory; inhibitor/antagonist; Injury; Innate Immune System; Integral Membrane Protein; Interferon Activation; Interferon Type I; Interferons; Intestinal Secretions; IRF3 gene; Knockout Mice; Lead; Ligands; liquid chromatography mass spectrometry; Liver; liver inflammation; liver injury; Measures; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; Modeling; Molecular Biology; Monitor; mouse model; Mus; Natural Immunity; Nuclear Translocation; Pathogenesis; Pathogenicity; Periodicity; Permeability; Pharmacology; Phase; Phosphorylation; Play; prevent; Production; Receptor Signaling; Reporter; Reporting; Research; Research Proposals; response; Role; sensor; Serum; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; small molecule inhibitor; spatiotemporal; Sterility; Technology Transfer; Testing; Therapeutic Intervention; therapeutic target; Time; TLR4 gene; Toll-like receptors; transcription factor; Transduction Gene; Viral Vector; Virus; Virus Diseases; ","STING and IRF3 activation by cyclic dinucleotides in early alcoholic liver disease","025545","ZAA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","30046","","30046",""

There are no drugs approved by the FDA to treat such Ras-driven cancers. ADT Pharmaceuticals Inc. has discovered a novel class of Ras inhibitors and identified a preclinical drug development candidate, DC070-547, that potently and selectively inhibits the growth of tumor cells harboring activated Ras. While DC070-547 has attractive drug-like properties and promising antitumor activity of the intraperitoneally administered drug in mouse models of cancer, an oral formulation of the drug is urgently needed to enable the progression of DC070-547 through pre-clinical studies and eventual clinical trials involving human patients with Ras-driven cancers, prominently including certain colorectal, pancreatic, and lung cancers. ADT Pharmaceuticals, Inc. will work closely with Catalent, Inc., a world-wide leader of drug formulation technology, to develop a pharmaceutically optimized formulation of DC070-547 suitable for clinical evaluation of the orally administered drug.","12630910; 12051259 (contact); ","BOYD, MICHAEL R; CANZONERI, JOSHUA  (contact);","HAIM, TODD E.","09/21/2017","03/21/2018","Address; Affinity; Alpha Cell; analog; base; Binding; Cancer Model; cell growth; Cells; Chemicals; chemotherapy; Clinic; clinical application; clinical development; Clinical Trials; Colonic Neoplasms; Colorectal Cancer; Colorectal Neoplasms; Data; Development; Dose; drug development; Drug Formulations; Drug Kinetics; Drug resistance; effective therapy; efficacy study; Evaluation; Excipients; FDA approved; Formulation; Future; Generations; Goals; Growth; Guanosine Triphosphate; Half-Life; HCT116 Cells; Histologic; HRAS gene; Human; improved; in vivo; Injection of therapeutic agent; intraperitoneal; Investigation; KRAS2 gene; Lead; Lipids; Lung Neoplasms; Malignant - descriptor; Malignant neoplasm of lung; Malignant neoplasm of pancreas; Malignant Neoplasms; MAP Kinase Gene; Mediating; Medical; mouse model; Mus; mutant; Mutation; nanomolar; National Cancer Institute; Neoplasm Metastasis; neoplastic cell; Normal tissue morphology; novel; novel therapeutic intervention; oncology; Oral; pancreatic neoplasm; Particle Size; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; pharmacokinetic characteristic; Pharmacologic Substance; Phase; Phase I Clinical Trials; Phenotype; Plasma; preclinical development; Preclinical Drug Development; preclinical efficacy; preclinical study; Property; Protein Isoforms; Protocols documentation; Qualifying; Radiation; RAS Family Gene; ras Genes; Ras Inhibitor; ras Oncogene; ras Proteins; Ras/Raf; Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases; research clinical testing; Resistance; scale up; Schedule; screening; Series; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Small Business Innovation Research Grant; small molecule; small molecule inhibitor; Solid; Solubility; Solvents; stability testing; Stress; success; Surface; Suspensions; Technology; Testing; Tissues; Toxic effect; tumor; Tumor Cell Line; tumor growth; tumorigenesis; uncontrolled cell growth; United States Food and Drug Administration; Water; Work; Xenograft Model; ","Oral formulation for novel inhibitor of Ras driven cancers","217502","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","01","","","300000",""

These metabolites are produced in response to cellular processes involving genes and proteins. In recent years, the field has gained more and more momentum for its utility in uncovering metabolites that could be measured in the clinic, and could help predict diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment outcome. Due to technical and data analysis limitations, metabolomics data is difficult to analyze and interpret. For example, the biological (e.g. genes, proteins) and environmental (e.g. diet, pollution) factors that may influence the levels of these metabolites are generally poorly understood. To address these limitations, the goal of this proposal is to integrate known biological information and processes for genes and metabolites to better understand the production and function of disease-related metabolites. To accomplish this, we propose to develop an integrative and comprehensive database of biological processes with user-friendly access and analysis tools.","12249005; ","MATHE, EWY A;","SPALHOLZ, BARBARA A.","09/19/2017","08/31/2018","Address; Adopted; Affect; analytical method; Basic Science; Biochemical; Biochemical Pathway; Biological; Biological databases; Biological Factors; Biological Markers; Biological Process; Blood; Cell physiology; Clinic; Clinical; Clinical Research; clinically relevant; collaborative approach; Communication; Communities; Complex; computerized tools; Computing Methodologies; Data; data acquisition; Data Analyses; database structure; Databases; Development; Diagnosis; diagnostic biomarker; Diet; Disease; Disease Pathway; Disease Progression; early detection biomarkers; Early Diagnosis; Ensure; experimental study; Foundations; Future; Gene Proteins; Gene Targeting; Genes; Genomics; Goals; high throughput technology; Human; improved; Knowledge; Measures; meetings; metabolic phenotype; metabolomics; Methods; Molecular; new therapeutic target; novel; open data; open source; outcome forecast; Pathway Analysis; Pathway interactions; Patient-Focused Outcomes; Phenotype; Play; Pollution; Processed Genes; Production; Prognostic Marker; relational database; Reproducibility; Reproducibility of Results; response; Role; Screening for cancer; small molecule; Source; Source Code; Statistical Data Interpretation; Therapeutic; Time; Tissues; tool; Translational Research; Treatment outcome; treatment response; Urine; user-friendly; Vision; web app; web interface; web-accessible; ","A comprehensive gene and metabolite pathway database for improving interpretation of metabolomics data","222428","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","100000","55167","155167",""

Recent evidence associates breast  cancer risk and response to therapy with diet-induced obesity and tissue inflammation, though the mechanisms  that link these pathologies are poorly understood. We propose to examine a novel protein that functions at the  intersection of obesity, inflammation, and aggressive breast cancers in African American women. Study of this  pathway may provide future clinical impact by defining underlying a cellular and environmental network that  promotes tumor growth, metastases, and chemotherapeutic resistance.","9591171; ","FLEMING, JODIE MICHELLE;","","","","Address; African American; Automobile Driving; Behavior; Benzo(a)pyrene; Binding; bioaccumulation; Biochemical; Bioenergetics; Biological; Biological Assay; Biopsy; Breast; Breast Cancer Cell; Breast Cancer cell line; Breast Cancer Model; Breast Cancer Patient; cancer cell; cancer health disparity; cancer risk; cancer stem cell; cancer subtypes; Carcinoma; cell behavior; Cell Nucleus; Cell physiology; Cells; ChIP-seq; Clinical; Clinical Data; Communities; Complex; Computer Analysis; Data; Data Analyses; Diet; diet and cancer; DNA; DNA Binding; Drug resistance; Dyslipidemias; Endocytosis; Environment; Environmental Risk Factor; Ethnic group; Ethnic Origin; extracellular; Fatty acid glycerol esters; Future; Gene Expression; Generations; Genetic Polymorphism; health disparity; Hepatic; Hepatocyte; High Fat Diet; Homeostasis; Hydrophobicity; In Vitro; in vitro Assay; in vivo; Inflammation; Inflammation Mediators; Ingestion; insight; Insulin; Intercellular Junctions; Knowledge; Lead; Leptin; Light; Link; Lipids; Lipolysis; Lipoprotein Receptor; Lipoproteins; Low income; Luciferases; malignant breast neoplasm; Malignant Neoplasms; Mammary Gland Parenchyma; Measures; Mediating; Membrane; Metabolic; migration; Molecular; mortality; mouse model; Neoplasm Metastasis; neoplastic cell; new therapeutic target; novel; Nuclear; Obesity; obesogenic; Outcome; outcome forecast; overexpression; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Patient-Focused Outcomes; Patients; Phenotype; Physiological; Physiology; pollutant; Population; Postmenopause; Primary Neoplasm; promoter; protein function; Proteins; Proteomics; receptor expression; receptor function; Receptor Signaling; Regulation; Reporting; Research; Resistance; response; Risk Factors; ROCK1 gene; Role; Signal Transduction; social; socioeconomics; sugar; Testing; The Cancer Genome Atlas; Thinness; Tight Junctions; Tissues; Toxic Environmental Substances; toxicant; transcriptome; tumor; tumor growth; tumor initiation; tumor progression; tumorigenesis; uptake; Very low density lipoprotein; whole genome; Woman; Xenograft Model; ","Project 2 - Mechanisms linking Cancer Disparities and Metabolic Status","012392","ZMD1","Special Emphasis Panel ","5370","","01","201943","72653","","274596"

We have discovered a new gene, ABCB5, which identifies stem cells in human and mammalian limbus. This discovery has allowed us, for the first time, to purify limbal stem cells for transplantation and to successfully restore the cornea in LSCD. The current proposal builds upon these results to address important challenges that currently remain in achieving more universal success of cell therapy for patients with unilateral or bilateral LSCD. Specifically, we hypothesize that ABCB5+ limbal stem cells isolated and expanded ex vivo can be used as a source of autologous or allogeneic stem cells to regenerate the corneal epithelium and restore vision in patients with either unilateral or bilateral LSCD.","8148663 (contact); 7554725; 1879572; ","FRANK, MARKUS H.

Establishing the long-term effects of combat-related TBI would provide critical information to veterans who are concerned about their own risk for developing neurodegenerative conditions later in life and would inform public policy to ensure that appropriate resources are available for the future care of veterans. There is also a knowledge gap regarding the effects of PTSD and depressive symptoms on brain function and outcome following combat-related TBI. In addition, this investigation will elucidate the potential role of host factors such as genetics and cognitive and brain reserve.  This represents a unique opportunity to leverage the resources of ongoing cross-sectional studies, expand their scope, and extend them into a longitudinal design. We anticipate that this will allow a better understanding of TBI and provide the basis for development of new screening tools and rehabilitation procedures.","8423269 (contact); 8423277; ","SCHEIBEL, RANDALL S.

However, predicting the efficacy of such therapies (including immune checkpoint inhibitors) remains ambiguous in certain patient populations. Clinical studies have demonstrated the significant influence of microsatellite instability (MSI) status of tumors on the clinical benefit of an immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-1) where the response to treatment in patients (regardless of cancer type) with and without MSI is 70% vs 10%, respectively. Because the clinical evidence supporting MSI as a highly predictive, pan- cancer biomarker for response to checkpoint inhibitors is rapidly accumulating, there is an urgent need for molecular tests that can identify patients with MSI tumors across cancer types in an accurate, fast, cost-effective manner. This research proposes to develop a novel stand-alone molecular diagnostic assay to determine MSI status from plasma in cancer patients (known as CancerPROÔ MSI) to guide immunotherapy for multiple indications.","12370907; ","SAUSEN, MARK ;","LOU, XING-JIAN ","09/22/2017","03/21/2018","Agreement; base; Biological Assay; Biological Markers; Biopsy; cancer biomarkers; cancer care; Cancer Patient; cancer type; Cell Line; Cells; Clinical; Clinical Management; Clinical Research; clinical risk; Colorectal Cancer; cost; cost effective; Decentralization; Detection; Development; Diagnostic; diagnostic assay; Diagnostic tests; Disease; DNA; Evaluation; experimental study; Goals; Gold; Grant; Guidelines; Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Neoplasms; Human; Hybrids; Immune; Immune checkpoint inhibitor; Immunotherapy; improved; Inherited; inhibitor/antagonist; Laboratories; Lead; Malignant Neoplasms; Methods; Microsatellite Instability; Microsatellite Repeats; Mismatch Repair; Molecular; molecular diagnostics; Mutation; next generation sequencing; novel; open label; patient population; Patient risk; patient stratification; Patients; Performance; Phase; Phase I/II Trial; Plasma; Polymerase; predictive marker; Primary carcinoma of the liver cells; Public Health; Reporting; Reproducibility; Research; response; response biomarker; Sampling; screening; Series; Small Business Innovation Research Grant; Specificity; Specimen; Standardization; Stratification; Surgical complication; Survival Rate; Syndrome; targeted treatment; Testing; Time; Tissue Sample; Tissues; treatment response; tumor; tumor DNA; tumor heterogeneity; Tumor Tissue; Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes; Validation; ","Development of a Novel, Plasma-Based Microsatellite Instability Diagnostic for Guiding Immunotherapy","217544","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","01","","","297850",""

A defective or hyperactive V-ATPase can be associated with devastating human diseases such as renal tubular acidosis, osteoporosis, diabetes, neurodegeneration, cancer, and AIDS. Understanding the molecular origin of these diseases requires a detailed knowledge of the structure and regulation of the disease causing bio macromolecules. This proposal requests funds for determining high-resolution structures of the enzyme's catalytic (V1) and proton channel (Vo) sectors, elucidating the V-ATPase's unique mode of regulation, and for exploring non-canonical ion-conducting functions of the V-ATPase membrane sector. The long-term goal of the project is to gain a molecular understanding of V-ATPase's role in human disease and to identify ways to modulate the activity of the disease causing enzyme.","2265491; ","WILKENS, STEPHAN ;","FLICKER, PAULA F.","09/01/1999","07/31/2021","Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Address; Animals; ATP Hydrolysis; ATP phosphohydrolase; Biological Models; Bone remodeling; Cell membrane; Cell physiology; Cells; Communication; Complex; Conflict (Psychology); Data; Diabetes Mellitus; Disease; disease-causing mutation; Dissociation; Electrophysiology (science); Embryo; Endocytosis; enzyme activity; enzyme structure; Enzymes; Extracellular Space; fighting; FRAP1 gene; Funding; genetic manipulation; Goals; Hormones; Human; human disease; Hyperactive behavior; In Vitro; in vitro Model; Ion Channel; Ions; Knowledge; Lead; Legionella pneumophila; Link; Lipids; loss of function; macromolecule; Male Infertility; Malignant Neoplasms; Measurement; Membrane; Molecular; Motor; Multienzyme Complexes; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; nanodisk; Nerve Degeneration; Neurons; neurotransmitter release; Neurotransmitters; new therapeutic target; Organelles; Organism; Osteoporosis; pathogen; Physiological; Play; Process; Protein Isoforms; protein transport; Proteolipids; Proton Pump; Protons; Regulation; Renal tubular acidosis; Reporting; Request for Proposals; Research; Resolution; Role; Signal Transduction; single molecule; small molecule; Sperm Maturation; Structure; System; Therapeutic; Time; Tissues; Urine; vacuolar H+-ATPase; Work; Yeasts; ","Structure and regulation of the vacuolar ATPase","058600","BBM","Biochemistry and Biophysics of Membranes Study Section ","","A1","14","233000","118194","351194",""

Importantly, there are currently no therapeutic strategies that limit the growth of aneurysms, due in large part to a lack of understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of disease and progression. Since the risk factors for AAA include advanced age, male sex, and tobacco use, it is not surprising that over 68,000 Veterans within the VHA suffer from AAA. Our preliminary data indicates that advanced age is associed with enhanced vascular inflammation and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) disease in preclinical animal models in association with decreased microRNA-24. We proposed to use a combination of molecular and physiological models to clarify the underlying mechanism of how miR-24 can regulate AAA formation. The success of the proposed studies could lead to novel therapeutic approaches to prevent development and/or limit progression of AAA disease.","1912067; ","TSAO, PHILIP S;","","04/01/2015","03/31/2019","3' Untranslated Regions; Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm; Acceleration; Age; age related; Age-Years; aged; Aging; Aneurysm; Angiotensin II; Animal Model; animal tissue; Apoptosis; base; Binding; Biochemical; Biological Assay; Biology; Blood Vessels; Cell Adhesion; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell model; Cell physiology; cell type; Cells; Cessation of life; Chemotaxis; CHI3L1 gene; Chronic; clinical translation; Complex; cytokine; Data; Development; Disease; Disease Progression; Down-Regulation; Elderly; Endothelial Cells; Event; Family suidae; Gene Expression; Gene Targeting; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Transcription; Growth; Health; Histologic; Human; In Vitro; in vivo; Infiltration; Inflammation; Inflammatory; inflammatory marker; Interleukin-6; Intervention; Lead; macrophage; male; Mediating; Methods; MicroRNAs; Modeling; Molecular; molecular modeling; Molecular Models; Monitor; monocyte; mouse model; Mus; Mutagenesis; Mutate; novel; novel therapeutic intervention; older patient; Operative Surgical Procedures; overexpression; Oxidative Stress; Pancreatic Elastase; Pathway interactions; permissiveness; Pharmacology; physiologic model; Play; pre-clinical; Premature aging syndrome; Prevalence; prevent; Procedures; Process; protein expression; public health relevance; Regulation; Research; Risk Factors; Role; Rupture; Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm; Second Messenger Systems; sex; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Small Interfering RNA; Smooth Muscle Myocytes; Specificity; Stents; Structure; success; Therapeutic; therapeutic target; Time; Tissues; Tobacco use; Transfection; Ultrasonography; Up-Regulation; vascular inflammation; Vascular Smooth Muscle; Veterans; ","Regulatory Role of MicroRNAs in Aging-related Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Disease","002641","CARB","Cardiovascular Studies B ","","","03","","","",""

Purinergic receptors are potential therapeutic targets in these diseases and some drugs are in clinical trials for inflammatory diseases and shown to have efficacy. Development of more effective treatment strategies is severely hampered by our poor understanding of human gut neurobiology. Enteric glial cells (EGCs) are abundant in the gut and they may play a role in the neurophysiology and pathophysiology of the gut. They regulate intestinal homeostasis and few animal studies suggest a role in motility and purinergic signaling, but their precise role is not understood, especially in humans. The role of human EGCs in the physiology and pathophysiology of the gastrointestinal tract is not known, and addressing this critical gap in knowledge is important in determining how these cells regulate gastrointestinal functions in health and disease (POI and motility disorders). This also has important implications for identifying potential new targets for therapy including receptors, channels and purinergic drugs.","1858730 (contact); 1877271; ","CHRISTOFI, FEDIAS LEONTIOU (contact); GRIDER, JOHN R;","GREENWEL, PATRICIA ","09/18/2017","08/31/2020","Address; Affect; Animals; Bacteria; Behavior; Biological Assay; Biological Neural Networks; Biology; Brain; Cell Communication; cell motility; Cells; Cellular Mechanotransduction; Clinical Trials; Coculture Techniques; Collaborations; Communication; Complex; Custom; Data; Development; Disease; Dreams; ectoATPase; effective therapy; Electrophysiology (science); Enteral; Enteric Nervous System; Environment; Enzymes; Evaluation; frontier; Functional disorder; gastrointestinal function; Gastrointestinal tract structure; Gene Expression; Genes; glial activation; Health; Health Care Costs; Human; human tissue; IL1R1 gene; IL6 gene; Ileus; Image; Immune; Inflammation; Inflammation Mediators; Inflammatory; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Inflammatory disease of the intestine; Interleukin-1 beta; Intervention; intestinal homeostasis; Intestinal Motility; Intestines; Knowledge; Liquid substance; Luciferases; luciferin; Mechanical Stimulation; mechanotransduction; Medicine; Membrane; Messenger RNA; Methods; Modeling; Molecular; Monitor; motility disorder; Motor; Motor Activity; Mus; Muscle; Neurobiology; Neuroglia; neuromuscular transmission; Neurons; neurophysiology; neuroregulation; new technology; new therapeutic target; novel; Operative Surgical Procedures; Organ; Paper; Pathway interactions; Pattern; Peristalsis; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacology; Phase; Phenotype; Physiology; Play; Postoperative Period; pressure; Production; Prospective Studies; Publications; Purinoceptor; Radial; receptor; Reflex action; relating to nervous system; Research Personnel; response; Ribosomes; Role; sensor; shear stress; Signal Transduction; Site; Small Interfering RNA; species difference; Stretching; Synapses; Testing; Therapeutic; therapeutic target; Time; Tissue Harvesting; translational impact; translational study; Trauma; treatment strategy; Vesicular Protein Transport; Vesicular Transport Proteins; ","Human enteric glia: A novel target for motility and postoperative ileus","113943","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","320345","149932","470277",""

CIPN may lead to dose reduction, dosing schedule changes and termination of treatment. Acute symptoms arising from neurotoxicity can appear rapidly upon infusion and transition to chronic peripheral neuropathy after termination of chemotherapy. Currently, there are no drugs that can prevent induction of CIPN and existing analgesic drugs are ineffective for the treatment of CIPN symptoms. Emerging evidence suggests that TRPA1 channels represent a new molecular target for discovery of a therapeutic agent which may be used in combination with taxanes or platinum-based drugs to effectively mitigate or prevent induction of CIPN. Algomedix has discovered a novel structural series of potent and selective small molecule TRPA1 antagonists having excellent drug-like features. Importantly, these compounds are active in rat models of neuropathic pain, including the paclitaxel-induced CIPN model. In this proposal, will use a combination of in vitro and in vivo studies to establish the efficacy of TRPA1 antagonists to reverse and/or prevent both acute and chronic pain behaviors in rodent paclitaxel and oxaliplatin models of CIPN. The overall goal of this study is to identify and optimize a novel TRPA1 antagonist as a therapeutic agent that can mitigate or prevent CIPN induced by many chemotherapeutic drugs.","8477687; ","HERZ, JEFF MARK;","WEBER, PATRICIA A","09/21/2017","08/31/2018","Abraxane; Acute; Acute Pain; acute symptom; Adverse effects; Affect; afferent nerve; Afferent Neurons; allodynia; Analgesics; ANK1 gene; Antineoplastic Agents; base; Behavioral; Biological Assay; Brain; Calcium; Cancer Patient; cancer therapy; Chemicals; chemotherapeutic agent; chemotherapy; Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy; Chronic; chronic pain; Clinical; clinical development; Clinical trial protocol document; Data; detector; Dose; drug discovery; Drug Kinetics; Drug usage; efficacy study; Eloxatin; Esthesia; Family; Generations; Goals; Hyperalgesia; Hypersensitivity; In Vitro; in vivo; ineffective therapies; Inflammation; Infusion procedures; Injury; Ion Channel; Label; Lead; Ligation; mechanical allodynia; Mechanics; Medical; member; Methods; Modeling; Molecular; Molecular Target; motor impairment; Mus; Nerve Fibers; nerve injury; Neurons; neurotoxicity; Nociception; Nociceptors; novel; novel strategies; novel therapeutic intervention; novel therapeutics; oxaliplatin; Paclitaxel; Pain; pain behavior; painful neuropathy; Patients; Peripheral Nerves; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacodynamics; Pharmacologic Substance; Pharmacology; Phase; Plasma; Platinum; Play; pre-clinical; preclinical development; prevent; Prevention; Prevention strategy; Program Development; Property; Protocols documentation; Quality of life; Rattus; receptor; response; Rodent; Role; Route; Schedule; Series; Signal Transduction; Small Business Innovation Research Grant; small molecule; Source; Spinal Ganglia; Spinal nerve structure; Symptoms; taxane; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Agents; Therapeutic Effect; Time; Tissues; Toxicity Tests; translational study; Treatment Protocols; TRP channel; Up-Regulation; ","Therapeutic TRPA1 Mechanism-Based  Treatment of Chemotherapeutic-Induced Neuropathic Pain","210759","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","01","","","291147",""

Individuals who grew up in a stressful family environment characterized by conflict, insensitive parenting, chaos, dysfunction and a lack of warmth are especially at risk for developing chronic diseases, although underlying mechanisms and the roles of culture and adolescent development in this relation are not well understood. The proposed program of research will investigate the prospective relations between family-related stress during adolescence and inflammatory and metabolic endpoints during adolescence and adulthood, the psychosocial and biobehavioral pathways underlying these links, and the role that ethnicity may play in these processes.","14124977; ","CHIANG, JESSICA ;","STONEY, CATHERINE ","09/20/2016","09/19/2019","Address; Adolescence; Adolescent; Adolescent Development; Adoption; Adult; Affect; American; Area; Asian Americans; Asians; Behavior assessment; Behavioral; biobehavior; Biological; Biology; Blood Pressure; Blood specimen; burden of illness; C-reactive protein; Cardiovascular Diseases; cardiovascular disorder risk; cardiovascular risk factor; Child; Child Rearing; Childhood; Cholesterol; Chronic; Chronic Disease; Conflict (Psychology); cultural values; Data; design; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; Disease Outcome; disorder risk; Eating; Economic Burden; eighth grade; Environment; epidemiologic data; ethnic diversity; Ethnic group; Ethnic Origin; European; experience; Family; Family Process; Fellowship; Fostering; Functional disorder; Genetic Transcription; Genomics; Glucose; Goals; Health; Health behavior; health difference; Immune; Immune system; Immunologics; indexing; Individual; Inflammation; Inflammatory; inflammatory marker; Inflammatory Response; insight; Intervention; Laboratories; laboratory experience; Latino; Life; Link; Literature; Longevity; Longitudinal Studies; Malignant Neoplasms; Measures; Mediating; Medical; Metabolic; Methods; Outcome; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Phenotype; physical inactivity; Play; Population; pre-clinical; Prevention; Preventive; Preventive Intervention; Process; programs; prospective; Psychologist; psychosocial; Psychosocial Assessment and Care; psychosocial development; Public Health; Publications; Reporting; Research; Research Personnel; Risk; Risk stratification; Role; Shapes; Signal Transduction; skills; social; Social Environment; Source; Stress; stressor; tenth grade; Theoretical model; Time; Training; Triglycerides; vigilance; Violence; waist circumference; Work; young adult; Youth; ","Adolescent Family Stress and Early Cardiovascular Risk: Psychosocial and Behavioral Pathways","134276","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","57954","","57954",""

Previous work suggests that Luminal B tumors are highly prevalent among Latina breast cancer patients from Colombia and that this linkage is related to Native American Ancestry. These results suggest a major contribution of ancestry in the modulation of key genomic players in defining not only the intrinsic breast cancer subtypes, but also the differential response to treatment and overall survival in Luminal B tumors. This work will test the hypothesis that Native American ancestry associated with a high incidence of aggressive Luminal B tumors due to altered DNA modification that changes the expression of key genes involved in aggressive breast cancer.","9592404; ","ZABALETA, JOVANNY ;","","09/21/2017","","Admixture; African; African American; Age; Alaska Native; American; Asians; base; biobank; Biological; Breast Cancer Patient; Cancer Center; cancer health disparity; cancer subtypes; candidate identification; caucasian American; Classification; Clinical; cohort; Colombia; Data; Disease; DNA Modification Process; Endocrine; Enhancers; epidemiology study; erbB-2 Receptor; ERBB2 gene; Estrogen Receptor alpha; Ethnic group; Ethnic Origin; European; Frequencies; Gene Expression; Genes; Genetic; Genomic Segment; Genomics; Goals; GRB7 gene; Health; Hispanics; hormone therapy; improved; Incidence; Indigenous American; Latina; Lead; Link; malignant breast neoplasm; Malignant Neoplasms; Methylation; migration; Molecular; Molecular Analysis; Molecular Epidemiology; molecular subtypes; mortality; Mutation; Native Americans; Not Hispanic or Latino; novel; Nuclear Hormone Receptors; Outcome; outcome forecast; Patients; Pilot Projects; Population; Portraits; precision medicine; Prognostic Marker; Proliferation Marker; promoter; prospective; Puerto Rico; Race; racial and ethnic; Recurrence; Reporting; Research; Research Training; Resistance; Risk; SEER Program; Specimen; Testing; Therapeutic; Tissue Sample; Tissues; transcriptome sequencing; Translating; treatment response; tumor; United States; Woman; Work; ","Pilot Project","202922","ZCA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","5752","A1","01","76816","35335","","112151"

We will test to see  if the method of coping used by AA males lead to increase in stress hormones that can cause kidney injury.

The long-term objective of the proposed research is to improve and automate techniques to quantify cellular tractions that can be used to better understand the role of tractions in biomechanical signaling and in the design new therapeutic interventions that target these pathways.  ","14983148; ","KLAAS, OTTMAR ;","LOU, XING-JIAN ","09/21/2017","09/20/2018","Accounting; Algorithms; Alpha Cell; Atherosclerosis; Atomic Force Microscopy; Behavior; Benchmarking; Biochemical; Biological; biological systems; Biology; Biomechanics; Breast Cancer Cell; cancer cell; cell motility; Cell physiology; Cell Shape; cell type; Cells; Chronic; Code; Communities; computer program; Computer software; Computer Systems; Computer-Aided Design; Custom; Data Set; design; Development; Dimensions; Disease Progression; Elements; Embryonic Development; Event; Extracellular Matrix; Fibroblasts; Gel; Generations; Heterogeneity; Human; improved; Individual; innovation; insight; Lead; Link; Malignant Neoplasms; Measurable; Measures; Mechanics; Methods; Microspheres; Modeling; novel; novel therapeutic intervention; optical imaging; Pathway interactions; Performance; Physics; Physiological; Play; Population; Process; Property; Research; Resolution; response; Role; Signal Transduction; Software Design; software development; Spatial Distribution; Specific qualifier value; stem cell differentiation; Techniques; Tissues; tool; Traction; Variant; ","Innovative Tools for Three Dimensional Traction Force Microscopy of Single Cells","224898","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","","","149448",""

It is often disabling, interfering with daily tasks or occupation, and forcing early retirement. Current therapies are often unsatisfactory. Molecular targets need to be identified for drug development. GABAA receptors contain alpha and beta subunits and are divided into those that use gamma or delta subunits. Based on pilot findings that drugs and low-dose alcohol known to activate delta GABAA receptors suppress tremor in the harmaline model of essential tremor in mice, we wish to first test the hypothesis that activation of delta GABAA receptors suppresses tremor, using wild- type and delta-knockout mice. Next, through the use of alpha and beta subunit knockout strains, we wish to identify more precisely which subtype of delta GABAA receptor mediates tremor suppression. This will provide a molecular target to which selective and potent drugs can be developed for subsequent testing in clinical trials. This work is intended to facilitae the development of better therapies for disabling tremor in veterans.","9898065; ","HANDFORTH, CHARLES ADRIAN;","","03/01/2014","02/28/2018","Affect; Age; alcohol effect; Alcohols; American; Animal Model; base; Behavior; Brain; Brain Mapping; Breeding; Calcium; Cells; Cerebellar cortex structure; Cerebellar Nuclei; Cerebellum; Clinical Trials; Data; design; Development; digital; disability; Disabled Persons; Dose; drug development; Essential Tremor; Ethanol; Exons; experimental study; Formulation; GABA Receptor; gamma-Aminobutyric Acid; ganaxolone; General Population; Genes; Goals; granule cell; Guidelines; Harmaline; Human; Impairment; In Vitro; Inferior; Intention Tremor; interest; Knock-out; Knockout Mice; Laboratory Research; Lead; Measures; Mediating; Modeling; Molecular Target; Motion; motor impairment; Mus; Muscimol; nervous system disorder; neurosteroids; Occupational; Occupations; Olives - dietary; Patients; Persons; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacotherapy; Prevalence; prevent; programs; promoter; public health relevance; receptor; Receptor Activation; Receptors, Opioid, delta; Recommendation; Reporting; Retirement; Role; Sedation procedure; Slice; social; Specificity; Testing; therapy development; Tremor; Upper Extremity; Veterans; Wild Type Mouse; Wine; Withdrawal; Work; ","A Delta GABA Receptor as a Target for Essential Tremor Therapy","001271","RRD6","Blank ","","","04","","","",""

In addition to its health consequences, AD and vascular dementia have been reported to triple the healthcare costs. Recent evidence suggests that vascular dysfunction leads to neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration, and might contribute to the development of CAA and AD. A? is the central component of plaques present in AD and cerebrovascular deposits in CAA, which may induce BBB permeability and A? decreased clearance. Thus, identifying molecules which ameliorate A? induced increases in permeability at the BBB, and increase the clearance of A??from the brain across the BBB could potentially lead to new treatments for A? pathogenesis related disorders CAA and AD.","9216011; ","KHALIL KADDOUMI, AMAL F;","CORRIVEAU, RODERICK A","09/01/2017","03/31/2018","","Targeting cerebrovascular endothelial cells as a therapeutic approach for amyloid pathogenesis","091934","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","91466","36237","127703",""

The major risk factor is smoking; however, most smokers do not develop COPD and the factors that identify who goes from normal to abnormal lung function are unknown. This proposal will leverage multiple, large international cohorts which contain a large number of well characterized smokers with normal lung function and have been followed for at least 3-5 year. We will use stored biologic samples to identify which blood biomarker signatures are useful to predict which smokers are likely to progress from normal lung function or to emphysema. This knowledge may help develop novel diagnostic tests and therapies for early prevention and treatment of COPD before it starts.
