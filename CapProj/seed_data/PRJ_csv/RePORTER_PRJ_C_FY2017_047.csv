Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesviruses (KSHV) and Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) are members of this family. These viruses are associated with several different cancers in the human population, are present in the oral cavity, and can be transmitted orally. The gammaherpesviruses establish life-long latency in the host. During latency the viral genome is chromatinized by host factors, and viral gene expression is extremely limited during latency. However during viral reactivation, many of the chromatin modifications are changed resulting in the transcription and expression of many more viral genes. We have recently performed a siRNA screen and identified a novel cellular kinase, tousled like kinase (TLK) that is involved in regulating the gammaherpesviral latent-lytic switch and modulating the host genome. In response to RFA-DE-13-002, we propose to understand how TLK regulates the viral epigenome to augment latency and suppress reactivation. Understanding of the mechanism involved in governing gammaherpesviral latency and reactivation is relevant to oral cancer and oral disease associated with replication of these viruses. Our investigation may help guide novel therapies for treatment of oral disease.","6931559 (contact); 6691168; ","DAMANIA, BLOSSOM A (contact); DITTMER, DIRK P;","LUNSFORD, DWAYNE ","09/17/2013","07/31/2018","Biology; Cell Culture Techniques; Cells; Chromatin; chromatin modification; Early Promoters; Elements; Epigenetic Process; epigenome; Epstein-Barr Virus latency; Family member; gammaherpesvirus; Ganciclovir; Gene Expression; Genetic Transcription; Genome; Herpesviridae; Herpesviridae Infections; histone modification; Human; Human Herpesvirus 4; Human Herpesvirus 8; in vivo; inhibitor/antagonist; Integration Host Factors; interest; Investigation; Killings; kinase inhibitor; knock-down; latent infection; Life; Lytic; malignant mouth neoplasm; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; Modification; mouse model; Mouth Diseases; neoplastic cell; novel; novel therapeutics; Oral; Oral cavity; oral cavity epithelium; Phosphotransferases; Polymerase; Population; prevent; promoter; protein complex; public health relevance; reactivation from latency; Research Personnel; response; Small Interfering RNA; Testing; transmission process; Viral; Viral Genes; Viral Genome; Virus; Virus Latency; Virus Replication; ","Targeting the epigenome of gammaherpesviruses in oral disease","023946","ZDE1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","S1","05","259631","135008","394639",""

Lrp4 acts bi-directionally to coordinate synapse formation by binding neuronal Agrin, activating MuSK and stimulating postsynaptic differentiation, and in turn functioning as a muscle-derived retrograde signal that is necessary and sufficient for presynaptic differentiation. Defects in this signaling pathway are responsible for a variety of congenital neuromuscular disorders and could underlie or contribute to neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS. The experiments described here are designed to determine how motor neurons respond to Lrp4, stimulating presynaptic differentiation.","1881118; ","BURDEN, STEVEN ;","NUCKOLLS, GLEN H.","02/01/1998","06/30/2020","Adult; age related; Agrin; agrin receptor; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Axon; axon growth; Binding; Binding Proteins; Biochemical; Biological; cDNA Expression; Cells; Complex; congenital neuromuscular disorder; Data; Defect; design; Development; Distal; experimental study; expression cloning; extracellular; Growth; Image; in vitro Assay; in vivo; Individual; insight; Learning; Light; Mass Spectrum Analysis; Mediating; Methods; Microscopy; Molecular; Motor; motor control; Motor Neurons; Mus; Muscle; Muscle Fibers; Muscular Atrophy; Myasthenia; Myasthenia Gravis; Nerve; Neurodegenerative Disorders; neuromuscular; Neuromuscular Diseases; Neurons; neurotransmitter release; novel; Play; postsynaptic; Postsynaptic Membrane; presynaptic; Production; Proteins; public health relevance; receptor; Resolution; RNA Interference; Role; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Synapses; Synaptic Transmission; Synaptic Vesicles; synaptogenesis; Time; ","Signaling by MuSK, a component of the Agrin receptor.","036193","NDPR","Neurodifferentiation, Plasticity, and Regeneration Study Section ","","","20","405790","282024","687814",""

In all species of eukaryotes, the mitochondrial genome, which is physically small with relatively few genes, is required for respiration. In all species of eukaryotes, the bulk of the mitochondrial proteome is encoded by the nuclear genome and all mitochondrially-encoded genes must form complexes with nuclearly encoded genes for (proper) function. Despite the importance of the mitochondrial genome, the impact of mitochondrial polymorphisms on complex (i.e. quantitative/multi-genic) traits and phenotypes is ignored or poorly understood. Improving our understanding of mitochondrial genome polymorphisms and their impact on complex traits and phenotypes is aided by tractable model systems, such as S. cerevisiae. Much the same can be said of S. cerevisiae viruses and host-virus interactions. The health relatedness of this project lies in our study in S. cerevisiae of host-virus and nucleo- mitochondrial complex traits, which have been poorly understood, where they have been studied at all. Our study in S. cerevisiae of host-virus and nucleo-mitochondrial complex traits will aid our understanding of complex traits in general and of host-virus and nucleo- mitochondrial genetics in particular.","1858381; ","MCCUSKER, JOHN H.;","REDDY, MICHAEL K.","08/16/2017","05/31/2021","Biological; Biological Models; cold temperature; Complex; Diploidy; Drug resistance; Drug Targeting; Ethanol; Eukaryota; Failure; fungus; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Polymorphism; Genetic study; Genome; genome wide association study; Genotype; Glucose; Growth; Health; Heritability; High temperature of physical object; Human; Image Analysis; improved; Inherited; Length; Mitochondria; mitochondrial genome; Modeling; novel therapeutics; Nuclear; Parents; pathogen; Pathogenicity; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phenotype; Population; Population Control; Prions; Proteome; Quantitative Genetics; quantitative imaging; Recombinants; Respiration; rho; RNA; RNA Viruses; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Source; Spottings; Temperature; trait; transcriptome; transcriptome sequencing; Virus; virus host interaction; Work; Yeasts; ","Nuclear, mitochondrial and L-A virus contributions to yeast quantitative traits","118936","GVE","Genetic Variation and Evolution Study Section ","","A1","01","260000","149622","409622",""

RDS has emerged as one of the premier data collection approaches for hard to survey subpopulations such as those at high risk of contracting HIV. While RDS has seen substantial methodological development around the estimation of disease prevalence and other univariate statistics, statistical development around the estimation of parameters from multivariate regression models with RDS data has previously escaped attention. Despite hundreds of RDS samples having been collected using more than $166 million in federal funding, there is deep uncertainty in the literature about the best approaches to estimating parameters from multivariate models with these data. Indeed, the literature offers no clear guidelines and, as such, we found more than 10 separate approaches to estimating parameters from these models with little consideration to which work best. This is unfortunate because many of the classic methods of data analysis in the social and public health sciences rely on multivariate regression models to understand risk factors, rule out alternative explanations, and test the robustness of results. We will use a simulation evaluation framework to analyze the properties of the most popular approaches to RDS regression estimation found in the literature, and we will develop and offer clear guidelines linked to shared statistical software that other researchers can apply to obtain unbiased and efficient parameters for multivariate models with RDS data.

Our hypothesis is supported by the observation that one copy of this gene is disrupted in ~60% of prostate tumors and our data showing that reconstitution of its expression in PCa cell lines suppresses proliferation by inducing a cell cycle arrest without a concomitant block in DNA synthesis leading to endoreplication and eventual cell death and architecture/growth defects ion 3D organoids. While this preliminary data are highly supportive, it is necessary to demonstrate the transforming and tumorigenicity properties of PPP2R2A inactivation in cultured prostate epithelial organotypic 3D cultures and immunocompromised mice to demonstrate feasibility prior to embarking on studies involving mouse PCa models, human samples and drug screens. Because the frequency of PPP2R2A alterations in prostate tumors is so elevated and appears to occur early, our studies are relevant to the majority of PCa patients. If PPP2R2A deletion is proven important for PCa development, we will have identified a new therapeutic target Because PPP2R2A alterations occur at high frequency in prostate tumors, the proposed studies will lay the molecular and biological framework for the development of novel classes of PP2A drugs that could potentially help treat the large pool of PCa patients with hemizygous deletions on PPP2R2A.","6446034; ","GRANA, XAVIER ;","YASSIN, RIHAB R.","08/14/2017","07/31/2019","Affect; AKT1 gene; Alpha Cell; Architecture; Binding; Biological; Biological Assay; Biological Process; Cell Cycle; Cell Cycle Arrest; Cell Death; Cell Differentiation process; Cell Line; Cells; Cellular Spheroids; Collection; Complex; Critical Pathways; Cultured Cells; cyclin B1; Data; Defect; Development; Disease-Free Survival; DNA biosynthesis; Down-Regulation; DU145; Ectopic Expression; Environment; Epithelial; Epithelial Cells; Exhibits; Fibroblasts; Frequencies; Gene Family; Genes; Growth; Holoenzymes; Human; Immunocompromised Host; Invaded; Ions; Link; loss of function; malignant breast neoplasm; Malignant neoplasm of prostate; Malignant Neoplasms; matrigel; Mediating; Membrane; Mitotic; Modeling; Molecular; monolayer; mRNA Expression; Mus; negative affect; neoplastic cell; new therapeutic target; Normal Cell; novel; Oncogenes; Organoids; Ovarian; Pathway interactions; Patients; PC3 cell line; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacology; Phenothiazines; Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases; Phosphorylation; PI3K/AKT; Play; Preclinical Drug Evaluation; Property; Prostate; Prostatic Neoplasms; Protein Dephosphorylation; Protein Phosphatase 2A Regulatory Subunit PR53; Proteins; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; reconstitution; Retinoblastoma Protein; Sampling; SCID Mice; Signal Transduction; Structure; Substrate Specificity; Suggestion; Suppressor Genes; Testing; The Cancer Genome Atlas; Therapeutic; three dimensional cell culture; Toxic effect; tumor; tumor growth; Tumor Suppression; Tumor Suppressor Genes; Tumor Suppressor Proteins; Tumorigenicity; Up-Regulation; Work; ","PPP2R2A tumor suppression haploinsufficiency in prostate cancer","216134","ZCA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","50000","29250","79250",""

Using a model of human erythropoiesis, we will utilize novel methodologies to (1) systematically dissect the function of 75 loci recently implicated in common erythroid trait variation using a massively parallel reporter assay with subsequent verification by state-of-the-art gene editing to implicate these loci in erythropoiesis, (2) describe novel erythroid- specific enhancer function and discover binding sites and their cognate transcription factors, and (3) determine the extent to which common transcriptional regulatory patterns dependent upon GATA1, a master regulator of erythropoiesis, are disrupted by common genetic variation. These studies have significant implications for improving our understanding of erythropoiesis generally, the role of genetic variation in this process, and the necessity of master regulator GATA1 and cofactors in this process; these findings may lead to improved therapies for numerous forms of anemia that are major sources of morbidity and mortality worldwide.","9448253; ","SANKARAN, VIJAY GANESH;","BISHOP, TERRY ROGERS","09/20/2014","07/31/2019","Affect; Algorithms; Alleles; Anemia; Binding; Binding Sites; Bioinformatics; Biological; Biological Assay; cell type; Cells; Child; Chromatin; cofactor; CRISPR/Cas technology; cyclin D3; Development; Disease; Dissection; dosage; Elements; Enhancers; Epigenetic Process; Erythrocytes; Erythroid; Erythroid Cells; Erythropoiesis; Etiology; follow-up; Follow-Up Studies; Future; GATA1 gene; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profiling; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Enhancer Element; Genetic Transcription; genetic variant; Genetic Variation; Genome; genome editing; genome wide association study; genome-wide; genome-wide analysis; Genomic DNA; Hematopoietic; high throughput screening; Human; human disease; human tissue; improved; innovation; interest; Investigation; Lead; Link; Linkage Disequilibrium; Measures; Methodology; Methods; Modeling; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Mutagenesis; novel; Nucleotides; overexpression; Pattern; Point Mutation; Process; Production; public health relevance; Regulatory Pathway; Reporter; Reporter Genes; Resources; Role; Signal Transduction; Source; Statistical Models; Stem cells; Subfamily lentivirinae; success; TAL1 gene; Technology; therapeutic target; trait; transcription factor; Transcription Factor 3; Transcriptional Regulation; Untranslated RNA; Variant; Woman; Work; ","Systematic Genetic Dissection of Human Erythropoiesis","103794","MCH","Molecular and Cellular Hematology Study Section ","","","04","225000","173250","398250",""

The majority of HIV-negative individuals infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) are latently infected (LTBI) but progress to clinically active TB when co-infected with HIV. Antigen-specific T cells are crucial for controlling Mtb infection in humans and lowering of CD4 T cell counts after HIV infection greatly increases the risk of developing TB. However, the mechanisms by which Mtb-specific T cell responses maintain LTBI in the lung, and how their loss results in HIV-induced reactivation of LTBI remain unclear. We hypothesize that co-infection with HIV depletes and/or impairs in the functional capacities of Mtb-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells to drive reactivation of LTBI and that antiretroviral therapy (ART) only partially restores these functions. We will mechanistically assess the impact of ART as well as concurrent isoniazid preventive therapy directed at viable Mtb bacilli, on antigen-specific immune responses.","8627728 (contact); 8510044; ","KAUSHAL, DEEPAK  (contact); RENGARAJAN, JYOTHI ;","FRANK, DANIEL J.","08/15/2017","07/31/2021","Activities of Daily Living; Address; Aerosols; Alveolar Macrophages; Animals; Antibiotics; Antigens; antimicrobial; antiretroviral therapy; Bacillus (bacterium); Biopsy; Blood; Blood specimen; Bronchoalveolar Lavage; Caring; Cause of Death; CD4 Lymphocyte Count; CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; CD8B1 gene; Cell Count; Cessation of life; Clinical; Clinical Trials; co-infection; Cytoplasmic Granules; cytotoxic; Data; design; Disease; Dose; functional disability; functional restoration; Goals; HIV; HIV Infections; Human; Immune; immune function; Immune response; Immune System and Related Disorders; Immune System Diseases; Immunity; Immunology; Impairment; Incidence; Individual; Infection; Infection Control; insight; isoniazid; Killings; Kinetics; Lesion; Lung; Macaca; Macaca mulatta; macrophage; Mediating; Modeling; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; nonhuman primate; Pathologic; Pathway interactions; Preventive therapy; Preventive treatment; Production; reactivation from latency; reconstitution; Regimen; response; restoration; Risk; Role; SIV; T cell response; T memory cell; T-Lymphocyte; Testing; Tissues; Treatment Protocols; Tuberculosis; tuberculosis immunity; tuberculosis treatment; Tuberculosis Vaccines; uptake; Vaccines; Viral Load result; Virus Diseases; World Health Organization; ","Impact of concurrent HIV and latent TB therapies on Mtb-specific immune function","123047","AOIC","AIDS-associated Opportunistic Infections and Cancer Study Section ","","A1","01","656613","216430","873043",""

Vascular cognitive impairment dementia (VCID) is the second most important cause of dementia by itself and an accelerator of Alzheimer?s disease (AD). The small vessel form of VCID, subcortical ischemic vascular disease (SIVD), is a progressive process that is optimal for treatment trials. Biomarkers can be used to identify patients with SIVD. This proposal is to optimize the two most promising biomarkers based on MRI modalities and biochemical studies of CSF. These will identify those patients at risk for enlarging the white matter damage (MRI diffusion studies) and for neuroinflammation (CSF MMP studies). The milestone-driven proposal will optimize these biomarkers in the first two years (U2 phase), and expand them to other centers in the next two years (U3 phase), making them available for clinical trials in the last year.","6796415; ","ROSENBERG, GARY ALLEN;","MCGAVERN, LINDA ","09/30/2016","07/31/2018","Albumins; Alzheimer's Disease; Anisotropy; Atrophic; base; Biochemical; Biological Assay; Biological Markers; Brain; Brain region; Classification; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials; Cognition; cohort; cost; cytokine; Data; Dementia; density; Diffuse; Diffusion; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Disease; Disease Progression; Early identification; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Functional disorder; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Future; Goals; gray matter; Growth; Health; Image; Impaired cognition; independent component analysis; indexing; Individual; Inflammatory; Joints; Knowledge; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; magnetic resonance imaging biomarker; Measurement; Measures; Memory; Methods; Microvascular Dysfunction; Modality; Neurites; neuroinflammation; New Mexico; novel; Outcome Measure; patient biomarkers; Patient Selection; Patients; Peptides; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase; predictive marker; Prevalence; Process; progression marker; Radial; Reproducibility; response; Rest; Risk; Signal Transduction; Structure; subcortical ischemic vascular disease; Subgroup; Surrogate Markers; Testing; Time; Tissues; treatment trial; Universities; Vascular Cognitive Impairment; white matter; white matter damage; White Matter Hyperintensity; white matter injury; ","MRI and CSF Biomarkers of White Matter Injury in VCID","100598","ZNS1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","837071","227062","1064133",""

A major cause of morbidity and hospitalization is diabetic foot ulceration (DFU), which can significantly impair a patient's quality of life, result in infection, gangrene, amputations, and costly treatments that require prolonged hospitalization. FirstString Research has made significant clinical progress toward approval of its novel connexin-based peptide for DFUs with the help of SBIRs and private funding. In our effort to complete all FDA mandated studies to support Granexin approval, we need to conduct a 39-week GLP dermal toxicity study of Granexin gel in the Gttingen mini-pig followed by a 14-day recovery to satisfy FDA's recommendation consistent with the published FDA Guidance for Industry in the development and approval for chronic wound therapeutics. Successful completion of this aim will fill in a necessary gap in obtaining New Drug Approval for Granexin from the FDA and support the eventual market launch of Granexin for the treatment of DFUs.","9009622; ","GHATNEKAR, GAUTAM SUDHIR;","JONES, TERESA L Z","09/15/2007","10/31/2018","Advanced Development; Adverse event; American; Amino Acids; Amputation; Area; Award; base; Biological Assay; Biological Products; Biomedical Engineering; Blinded; Blood specimen; C-terminal; Caliber; Capital; Caring; Cells; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.); Chronic; chronic wound; Cicatrix; Clinical; clinical development; Clinical Trials; clinically significant; Connexin 43; Connexins; conventional therapy; cost; cost effective; Debridement; Dermal; design; Detection; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetic Foot Ulcer; Diabetic wound; Diagnosis; Dose; Evaluation; Expenditure; Extravasation; Family suidae; Fibrosis; Funding; Gangrene; Gel; Grant; Granulation Tissue; Growth Factor; healing; Healthcare; Healthcare Systems; healthy volunteer; Hospitalization; Human; Immune; Impairment; improved; Incidence; Industry; Infection; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Injury; Lead; Lower Extremity; malignant breast neoplasm; mechanical properties; Mediation; Medicine; meetings; Methods; Miniature Swine; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Multicenter Trials; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases; New Drug Approvals; novel; novel therapeutics; Ohio; patient home care; Patients; Peptides; Phase; Phase II Clinical Trials; Phenotype; preclinical study; Privatization; Process; programs; prospective; Proteins; Publishing; Quality of life; Randomized; Recommendation; Recovery; Refractory; regenerative; Regenerative Medicine; Research; research and development; Research Design; response; Risk; Rivers; Rodent; Role; Safety; Signal Transduction; Skin Substitutes; Skin wound; Small Business Innovation Research Grant; Small Business Technology Transfer Research; standard of care; Therapeutic; Thick; Time; Tissues; Topical application; Toxic effect; Toxicokinetics; Toxicology; Treatment Cost; Treatment Efficacy; United States National Institutes of Health; wound; wound closure; Wound Healing; ","Evaluation of a Novel Connexin-Based Peptide for the Treatment of Diabetic Wounds","080567","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","07","761385","91366","852751",""

Individuals with psychiatric conditions ranging from Social Anxiety and Depression to Autism Spectrum Disorder and Schizophrenia struggle to correctly interpret others' emotional states. To understand how alterations in brain function can give rise to the misperception of emotion cues, we first need better normative models of how information about others' emotional state derived from facial and vocal cues is represented within the human brain. Hence, here we use large, diverse and naturalistic stimulus sets encompassing facial expressions, emotional vocalizations and multi-modal videos to investigate the extent to which consistent representation of emotional state is observed across stimulus modalities, and to explore the organizational principles that can best explain voxel response profiles or tuning patterns to facial and vocal emotion cues.","9823804; ","BISHOP, SONIA JANE;","FERRANTE, MICHELE ","08/18/2017","05/31/2020","Address; Age; Anxiety; Arousal; Auditory; autism spectrum disorder; blood oxygen level dependent; Brain; Brain region; Categories; Characteristics; Clip; Code; Complex; Computer Vision Systems; Cues; Data; data acquisition; Data Collection; data modeling; Data Set; Decision Making; demographics; Dependence; Dimensions; Emotional; Emotions; Ethnic Origin; experimental study; Expressed Emotion; Face; Facial Expression; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Gender; Human; Image; imaging study; Individual; information model; Label; Literature; Mental Depression; Mental disorders; Modality; Modeling; neural model; novel; Participant; Pattern; Persons; Predisposition; Property; relating to nervous system; Research; response; Running; Schizophrenia; showing emotion; Signal Transduction; social anxiety; Source; Speech; Stimulus; Structure; Techniques; Testing; theories; trait; Validation; Visual; visual information; visual neuroscience; vocalization; Weight; Work; ","Multi-feature modeling of the neural representation of emotion- and identity-related information derived from facial and vocal cues","112541","ZMH1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","250000","120396","370396",""

With the recent development of human immune system (HIS) mice, it is now possible to attempt to recapitulate human transplantation studies using HIS mice expressing cytokines and HLA class I genes necessary for development, education and function of human NK cells and T cells. Thus the aim of this project is to develop HIS mice expressing human cytokines and HLA class I molecules that encode NK cell ligands and promote their in vivo education in order to harness NK cell effector functions in response to hematologic cancers.","11147740; ","HOROWITZ, AMIR ;","RICE, JEFFREY S.","08/18/2017","07/31/2019","Activities of Daily Living; adaptive immunity; Address; adeno-associated viral vector; Adoptive Transfer; Alleles; Alpha Cell; Antibodies; Antigens; Autoimmunity; B-Lymphocytes; base; bioluminescence imaging; Blood; CD34 gene; CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes; CD8B1 gene; Cell Differentiation process; Cell physiology; Cells; Chromosomes; Clinical; Coculture Techniques; Complement; Complex; cytokine; Cytokine Signaling; Cytomegalovirus Infections; Cytometry; Dependovirus; Development; Donor Selection; Education; Effector Cell; Engraftment; Environment; Family; FCGR3B gene; Gene Delivery; Gene Transfer; Genes; Genotype; Goals; Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor; Haplotypes; Hematologic Neoplasms; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Hematopoietic stem cells; Histocompatibility Antigens Class I; HLA Class I Genes; HLA-A gene; HLA-DR1 Antigen; Human; Immune; Immune response; Immune system; Immunity; Immunization; Immunogenetics; Immunophenotyping; Immunotherapy; improved; in vivo; in vivo Model; Infection; Interleukin-15; Interleukin-2; Interleukin-3; Interleukin-6; Interleukin-7; killer immunoglobulin-like receptor; Kinetics; KLRD1 gene; Label; leukemia; Ligands; Longitudinal Studies; Luciferases; Lymphocyte; macrophage; Malignant Neoplasms; Maps; Measures; Mediating; MHC Class I Genes; Modeling; mouse model; Mus; Myelogenous; Names; Natural Immunity; Natural Killer Cells; Outcome; pathogen; Phenotype; polypeptide; Population; Predisposition; Process; receptor; Receptor Cell; reconstitution; reproductive success; Resolution; response; Sampling; Secondary to; Study models; Survival Rate; T-Lymphocyte; Therapeutic; Time; Transplantation; treatment strategy; tumor; Tumor Burden; Vaccines; Variant; Venous; Virus Diseases; ","Harnessing NK cell effector function for immunotherapies","130760","TTT","Transplantation, Tolerance, and Tumor Immunology ","","","01","150000","104250","254250",""

Trpm2 is a voltage-independent, cation-permeable ion channel that is widely expressed but its physiological function remains largely undefined. Although Trpm2 is expressed in the heart, very little information is known regarding its role in cardiac homestasis (8 publications). Our recent data indicate that Trpm2 is essential in cellular bioenergetics maintenance and redox balance in both the heart and neuroblastoma; and that Trpm2 protects the heart and neuroblastoma from oxidative-stress induced injury. Because Trpm2 is overexpressed in many cancers and the level of Trpm2 overexpression correlates with decreased patient survival and increased propensity for metastasis in some tumors, Trpm2 has increasing become a rational target for cancer therapy. In support of this concept, we showed that neuroblastoma xenografts over-expressing the dominant- negative Trpm2-S which suppressed Trpm2-mediated Ca2+ influx had significantly stunted growth and enhanced sensitivity to doxorubicin. In addition, targeting Trpm2 was recently shown to promote cell death in T cell leukemia. Trpm2 inhibition enhances the therapeutic effect of chemotherapy (e.g., doxorubicin) but may inadvertently aggravate existing ischemic heart disease and doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy. The study of Trpm2 in the heart is thus timely and will significantly contribute to the nascent field of onco-cardiology. This proposal critically examines the relationship between Ca2+ influx mediated by activated Trpm2 channels, Ca2+- dependent proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2) signaling cascade, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and bioenergetics maintenance. In addition, the role of Ca2+ entry via Trpm2 channels in reducing mitochondrial superoxide production and enhancing reactive oxygen species scavenging will be explored. Finally, genetic rescue experiments using a novel cardiac-specific Trpm2 knockout mouse will be performed.","1860180; ","CHEUNG, JOSEPH Y;","WONG, RENEE P","08/15/2017","05/31/2021","Ablation; Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose; Adult; Adverse effects; Antioxidants; base; Bioenergetics; Brain; cancer cell; Cardiac; Cardiac Myocytes; Cardiology; Cardiomyopathies; Cations; Cell Death; Cell physiology; Cells; chemokine; chemotherapy; Data; Disease; Dominant-Negative Mutation; Doxorubicin; Electron Transport; Energy Metabolism; Equilibrium; experimental study; Family; Generations; Genetic; Growth; Health; Heart; Hematopoietic; Hydrogen Peroxide; in vivo; Inflammatory Response; Injury; Ion Channel; Ischemia; Knock-out; Knockout Mice; loss of function; Maintenance; Malignant Neoplasms; Measures; Mediating; member; Membrane Potentials; Mitochondria; Mitochondrial Matrix; mitochondrial membrane; Modeling; mortality; Mus; Muscle Cells; mutant; Myocardial; Myocardial Ischemia; NADPH Oxidase; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neuroblastoma; novel; overexpression; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidative Stress; Oxygen Consumption; Patients; Performance; Permeability; Phosphorylation; Physiological; Predisposition; Production; protein expression; protein profiling; PTK2B gene; Publications; Reactive Oxygen Species; receptor; Reperfusion Injury; Reperfusion Therapy; Role; Sarcolemma; Signal Transduction; Stress; Subgroup; Superoxides; T-Cell Leukemia; targeted cancer therapy; Therapeutic Effect; Time; Tissues; tumor; uptake; voltage; Xenograft procedure; ","Trpm2: A novel target in Onco-cardiology","137426","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","394800","172575","567375",""

The disproportionate number of deaths from the disease in the Veteran population can be attributed in part due to its metastasis to the liver. Although not the most frequent site for metastasis, the mortality from liver metastasis is the greater than any other site of metastasis. A consequence of alcohol consumption, obesity, diabetes, and smoking is fatty liver disease. These risk factors for fatty liver disease are significantly greater in the Veteran population. We have shown for the first time that prostate cancer metastasis to the fatty liver is dramatically greater than its healthy counterpart. We hypothesize that the primary tumor microenvironment mimics fatty liver microenvironment and endoglin signaling contribute to a permissive niche for metastasis, to support the preclinical trial for an endoglin antagonist proposed.","2565214; ","BHOWMICK, NEIL A.;","","10/01/2012","06/30/2021","Adrenal Glands; Affect; alcohol consequences; Alcohol consumption; Alpha Cell; androgen deprivation therapy; androgen sensitive; Androgens; Animal Model; autocrine; bone; cancer cell; cancer diagnosis; Cancer Etiology; Carcinoma; Case Study; Cessation of life; Clinical; Collection; Consequentialism; Cutaneous; Data; deprivation; Diabetes Mellitus; Diagnosis; Disease; Disease remission; Employee Strikes; Endoglin; ENG gene; Epithelial; Epithelial-Stromal Communication; Epithelium; Erythrocytes; Family; fatty acid metabolism; fatty acid oxidation; Fatty Liver; Fibroblasts; Funding; Generations; Goals; Growth Factor; Healthcare Systems; Hepatitis; Hepatocyte; Hospitals; human tissue; in vivo; Intervention; Liver; Liver diseases; Location; Los Angeles; Lung; Maintenance; Malignant neoplasm of liver; Malignant neoplasm of prostate; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; member; Metastatic Neoplasm to the Liver; Metastatic Prostate Cancer; Metastatic to; mortality; Neoplasm Metastasis; neoplasm registry; neuroendocrine differentiation; notch protein; Obesity; paracrine; Paracrine Communication; Patients; permissiveness; Phenotype; Play; Population; preclinical trial; Primary Neoplasm; Prostate; prostate biopsy; prostate cancer cell; prostate carcinogenesis; Proteins; receptor; Reporting; Resistance; Risk Factors; Role; Saturated Fatty Acids; Screening for Prostate Cancer; Signal Transduction; Site; Smoking; Specimen; stem; Stromal Cells; Stromal Change; Stromal Neoplasm; System; Tenascin; Testing; Therapeutic; therapy resistant; Time; Tissue Recombination; Transforming Growth Factor beta; Transforming Growth Factor beta Receptors; Tropism; tumor; tumor growth; tumor microenvironment; tumorigenesis; tumorigenic; Tumorigenicity; Veterans; Xenograft procedure; ","Paracrine Mechanisms of Prostate Cancer Metastatic Progression","001040","ONCA","Oncology A ","","A1","05","","","",""

We believe that this fact is relevant to the present situation in which available treatments and preventions are inadequately effective for most people. We believe that an effective path to developing treatments and cures is opened up via deeper understanding of underlying circuit dynamics, which will be addressed here. Narrative In this project, the Center will 1) Bring together a diverse set of investigators for the important goal of understanding, both brainwide and at cellular resolution, the causal circuit dynamics of abused drug action; 2) Develop a broad range of new approaches for studying the actions of drugs of abuse on the brain; 3) Apply these approaches, collaboratively under the Center, to circuit dynamics of both acute and chronic abused- drug action; 4) Disseminate the resulting technologies to the drug abuse and supporting scientific communities through a unique and innovative training/educational program.","1895462; ","DEISSEROTH, KARL A.;","BERTON, OLIVIER ROLAND","08/15/2017","04/30/2022","Acute; Address; Animals; Behavior; Behavioral; Brain; Cells; Chronic; Clinical Pharmacology; clinically significant; Cognitive; Collaborations; Communication; Communities; Country; Dedications; design; Development; Disease; Drug abuse; Drug Addiction; Drug effect disorder; drug of abuse; ecstasy; Education; Education and Outreach; Educational process of instructing; entorhinal cortex; experience; experimental study; Functional Imaging; Goals; Hippocampal Formation; Human; Individual; innovation; Investigation; Ketamine; Lead; Learning; Mediating; Methamphetamine; Molecular Profiling; Mus; National Institute of Drug Abuse; Nature; Nervous system structure; neural circuit; next generation; novel; novel strategies; outreach; Perception; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacology; Physiology; Population; Prevention; programs; Public Health; Rattus; Research; Research Infrastructure; Research Personnel; Research Project Grants; Resolution; Rewards; Risk; Role; Science; Scientist; social; spatiotemporal; Specificity; Structure-Activity Relationship; Synapses; synergism; System; Techniques; Technology; technology development; Thinking; Training; Training and Education; Translations; ","Neural circuit dynamics of drug action","042012","ZDA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","01","1996520","955006","2951526",""

Project Narrative, Public Health Relevance Statement In the adult male, low testosterone causes infertility, fatigue, and loss of bone and muscle mass. Excess testosterone, as highlighted by the recent surge in testosterone replacement therapy, can elicit testicular shrinkage, prostate swelling, and sleep apnea. In fetal stages, low or high testosterone can cause urogenital birth defects, including disorders of sex development, and subfertility later in life. Clearly, tight control of androgen levels is critical at both stages. Leydig cells within the testis are the source of androgens that promote virility at both fetal and adult stages, but their populations are distinct. As such, adult and fetal Leydig cells function to synthesize testosterone in distinct cellular and endocrine environments, but we have preliminary data that suggests that they share common regulatory steps. This proposal puts forth the conceptual innovation that one factor, STAR, is a critical node by which input from multiple levels is coordinated to control testosterone synthesis in Leydig cells of both adult and fetal testes. Successful completion of these aims will provide an overlay of transcript, loci, and transactivator/chromatin mark information for Star and other enzyme genes over space and time within single Leydig cells in response to no, continuous, or pulsatile stimuli. Further, significant new knowledge will be gained in our understanding of how testosterone synthesis is controlled in fetal Leydig cells and we will, for the first time, undertake direct comparisons between adult and fetal Leydig cell activities. In essence, we will deliver almost minute-to-minute images of molecular events in Leydig cells in culture and, more critically, within adult and fetal testis from whole animal and explant/primary culture approaches. This will provide the added benefit of facilitating comparisons of single Leydig cell activity depending on their immediate environment to learn how single cell function contributes to the whole of testosterone synthesis. These discoveries will help us to understand the biology of external control of testosterone synthesis in fetal and adult testes. In the fetal testes, new knowledge from these studies will help to explain birth defects and testis dysgenesis syndrome and their association with adult diseases. Finally, additional knowledge regarding adult Leydig cell testosterone synthesis regulation events will bring us closer to understanding causes of infertility in men.","6695885; 8051982 (contact); ","JEFCOATE, COLIN ROBERT; JORGENSEN, JOAN S (contact);","MOSS, STUART B.","08/16/2017","04/30/2022","Acute; Adult; Age; Androgens; Animals; arm; Biology; bone loss; bone mass; Cell Count; Cell Differentiation process; Cell physiology; Cells; Cholesterol; cholesterol control; Chromatin; clinically significant; Congenital Abnormality; Cyclic AMP; Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases; Data; design; Diagnosis; Disease; Endocrine; Endocrine disruption; Endocrine Disruptors; Environment; Enzymes; Erinaceidae; Event; Excision; experimental study; Exposure to; Fatigue; fetal; Fetal Development; Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization; Gatekeeping; Gene Expression Regulation; Genes; genetic regulatory protein; Genetic Transcription; Genitourinary system; Health; Hereditary Disease; Image; In Vitro; in vivo; Individual; Infertility; innovation; Kinetics; Knowledge; Learning; leydig interstitial cell; Life; Maintenance; male; Mediator of activation protein; men; Messenger RNA; Microfluidics; Molecular; molecular imaging; mouse model; muscle form; Newborn Infant; novel; Output; paracrine; Paracrine Communication; Pathway interactions; Pattern; Physiologic pulse; Physiological; Play; Population; Pregnancy; prevent; Production; Prostate; Puberty; public health relevance; Publishing; Regulation; Reporting; Resolution; response; RNA; RNA Splicing; Role; Series; sertoli cell; sex development disorder; Sex Differentiation Disorders; Signal Transduction; Sleep Apnea Syndromes; Source; Steroids; Stimulus; Swelling; Syndrome; Techniques; Technology; Testing; Testis; Testosterone; testosterone replacement therapy; Time; tool; Trans-Activators; Transcript; Transcriptional Regulation; trend; ","Mediators for dynamic regulation of Star transcription in Leydig cells","090660","ICER","Integrative and Clinical Endocrinology and Reproduction Study Section ","","A1","01","427517","184342","611859",""

Lead can accumulate in the human body's soft tissue and bones, cause poisoning, and disrupt body processes, and is toxic to many internal organs. The primary source for lead in most drinking water supply stems from the leaching of lead from lead-bearing pipes in a water distribution system or the household plumbing/fixtures. Catalyzed by the unfortunate Flint Water Crisis, there is increasing public demand on water quality monitoring in the entire drinking water supply system, from the water treatment plant to the tap at the point of use. Current quantitative detection methods for aqueous lead are mostly laboratory-based and are too expensive and time-consuming, unsuitable for end water users to perform fast and onsite detection. This project will contribute to enhancing the public health by providing water users with a handheld device for real-time, onsite monitoring of lead in tap water.","14879322; ","LU, GANHUA ;","HENRY, HEATHER F","08/15/2017","07/31/2018","Address; Affect; Aging; aqueous; Bacteria; base; Behavior; Biological; bone; Brain; Calcium; Cations; Chemicals; Child; commercialization; Communication; Complex; contaminated drinking water; cost; cost effective; Coupling; Data; Detection; Development; Devices; digital; Disinfection; drinking water; Ensure; Environment; Event; Future; Glutathione; Gold; graphene; handheld equipment; Health; Health Benefit; Heart; Heavy Metals; Household; Human body; Hybrids; Immobilization; improved; In Situ; innovation; Intake; Ions; Kidney; Label; Laboratories; Lead; lead concentration; lead contamination; lead exposure; lead ion; Lead levels; Lead Poisoning; Legal patent; Magnesium; Measurement; Mercury; meter; Methods; Michigan; Modeling; Monitor; nanoparticle; nanosensors; Nanostructures; novel; operation; Organ; Oxides; Performance; Phase; Plants; Plumbing; Poisoning; portability; Preparation; Privatization; Process; Proteins; prototype; public drinking; Public Health; Reporting; Research; response; Risk; Safety; Sampling; Schools; Self-Administered; Sensitivity and Specificity; sensor; Signal Transduction; Small Business Technology Transfer Research; soft tissue; Source; stem; Structure; Surface; System; Technology; Test Result; Testing; Time; Training; United States Environmental Protection Agency; Water; water quality; Water Supply; water testing; water treatment; Wireless Technology; Wisconsin; ","Graphene-based Nanosensor Device for Rapid, Onsite Detection of Dissolved Lead in Tap Water","028656","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","","","194635",""

Shortness of breath and exercise limitation (ExLT) are very common in the HIV patient owing to a high prevalence of risk factors such as smoking, lung disease and other poorly understood immune factors unrelated to the burden of the HIV virus. It is very common to miss a serious disorder called pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) that is 2500 times more common in the HIV patient and often not diagnosed until late in the disease. We have recently provided feasibility data on a unique MRI compatible exercise platform (ExMR) that can provide high-resolution information on right ventricular (RV) function along with assessment of pulmonary artery pressure in response to exercise. In this grant application, we propose a novel use of this technology with a detailed assessment of cardiopulmonary indices to provide information on the prevalence and progression of PAH and progressive impairment in contractile function of the RV that commonly afflicts these patients.

One of the behaviors that contribute to this is increased sedentary behavior, or awake time spent sitting or lying down. This study will use a randomized, controlled design to determine whether an intervention focused on increasing awareness of sedentary behavior and strategies to reduce sitting will help prevent weight regain following weight loss in obese older adults. We expect to show that adding this component to a standard weight loss intervention will result in lower body weight and improve other health parameters after two years. In older adults, who have difficulty sustaining a high volume of moderate-intensity exercise, this could prove to be a more effective method for preventing weight regain following weight loss than the conventional approach of intervening on exercise behavior in this population.","1862018 (contact); 2447135; ","NICKLAS, BARBARA J (contact); REJESKI, WALTER JOHN;","RADZISZEWSKA, BARBARA ","05/15/2016","04/30/2019","Accelerometer; Activities of Daily Living; Address; Adult; Aerobic Exercise; Aftercare; Age; age group; arm; awake; Awareness; base; Behavior; Behavior Therapy; Behavioral; Biological Adaptation; Body Composition; Body Weight; Body Weight decreased; Bone Density; Caloric Restriction; cardiometabolic risk; Chronic Disease; Clinical; Cognitive; Counseling; Data; design; Desire for food; Diet; diet and exercise; Dietary intake; Eating; efficacy testing; Elderly; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; evidence base; Exercise; exercise intensity; fitness; follow-up; Goals; Guidelines; Health; improved; Individual; Intake; Intervention; intervention effect; Lead; Life Style; lifestyle intervention; Light; Maintenance; Measures; Mediating; Methods; Monitor; novel; Obesity; obesity treatment; Outcome; Participant; Pattern; Performance; Persons; Phase; Physical activity; Physical Function; Population; Predictive Factor; Prevalence; prevent; Process Measure; public health relevance; Randomized; Randomized Controlled Trials; recidivism; Recommendation; Reporting; Research; response; Rest; Science; secondary outcome; sedentary lifestyle; Self Efficacy; social; Structure; Time; total energy expenditure; treatment effect; Treatment Efficacy; United States National Institutes of Health; Weight; Weight Gain; weight loss intervention; Wing; Withholding Treatment; working group; ","Intervening on sedentary behavior to prevent weight regain in older adults","051624","CIDO","Clinical and Integrative Diabetes and Obesity Study Section ","","S1","02","97375","44756","142131",""

The human complement system is a primary arm of innate immunity with potent antimicrobial effector functions. A recent causal link between inappropriate activation of the classical complement pathway and Alzheimer?s disease has identified the initiating protease of the pathway, C1r, as a potential novel therapeutic target. As the current developmental pipeline for complement-directed drugs is ill-equipped to address this promising intervention point, this project focuses on the discovery of small molecule inhibitors of C1r. By adapting promising drug discovery screening technologies with specific structure-function knowledge of C1r we put forth a unique strategy to identify and characterize small molecules suitable for lead compound development of novel complement-directed Alzheimer?s disease therapies.","11827122; ","GARCIA, BRANDON LEE;","CORRIVEAU, RODERICK A","08/15/2017","07/31/2019","activation product; adaptive immunity; Address; Affect; Alleles; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's disease model; American; Antigen-Antibody Complex; antimicrobial; Apolipoprotein E; arm; Astrocytes; Autoimmune Process; base; Binding; Binding Proteins; Binding Sites; Biological Assay; Borrelia; Brain Diseases; Classical Complement Pathway; Clinical; Competitive Binding; Complement; Complement 1 Inactivators; Complement 1q; complement C3 precursor; Complement component C1r; Complement component C1s; complement pathway; complement system; Complex; Cytolysis; Deposition; Development; Disease; Drug Design; drug development; drug discovery; Enzyme Precursors; Event; Future; Goals; Homeostasis; Human; human disease; Immunologic Surveillance; In Vitro; in vitro Assay; Inflammatory; inhibitor/antagonist; Intervention; Knowledge; Lead; Libraries; Link; Maintenance; Maps; Mediating; Membrane; Methodology; microbial; Microglia; Modeling; Modernization; Molecular; Molecular Conformation; mouse model; mutant; Natural Immunity; Natural Products; Nerve Degeneration; Neurodegenerative Disorders; new therapeutic target; novel; novel strategies; novel therapeutics; Opsonin; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Pattern Recognition; Peptide Hydrolases; Phagocytes; Pharmaceutical Chemistry; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Physiological; Physiological Processes; Plasma Proteins; Play; Positioning Attribute; protein protein interaction; Recruitment Activity; Resolution; Role; scaffold; screening; senescence; Serine Protease; Serine Proteinase Inhibitors; Serum; Signal Transduction; single molecule; Site; small molecule; small molecule inhibitor; small molecule libraries; Specificity; Structure; Substrate Specificity; Surface; Surface Plasmon Resonance; Synapses; synaptic pruning; System; Technology; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Intervention; Triage; X-Ray Crystallography; ","Development of Small Molecule Inhibitors of the Classical Complement Pathway","102766","BPNS","Biophysics of Neural Systems Study Section ","","","01","150000","75000","225000",""

While the causes of hypertension in most cases are not known, a defect in the balance of nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide (O2?_), important regulators of vascular tone, may be a key initiating event. We have identified collectrin, a modulator of the balance of NO and O2?_, as a key regulator of blood pressure and salt sensitivity. Collectrin is expressed in many tissues. In this proposal, we will use mouse models to define the exact tissue- collectrin axis and mechanism by which collectrin regulates blood pressure and salt sensitivity for potential identification of new targets to treat hypertension. Across species, collectrin is expressed on the X-chromosome where genome wide association studies (GWAS) in humans have largely excluded due to low genotype coverage and a paucity of statistical methods to account for gene dosage in males versus females and random X-inactivation in females. We will determine the influence of collectrin on blood pressure in human populations by looking at genetic variants of the collectrin gene in four different human cohorts.","6484190; ","LE, THU H.;","KETCHUM, CHRISTIAN J.","08/15/2017","05/31/2022","Adult; Affect; African American; AGTR2 gene; American; Amino Acids; Angiotensins; Arginine; Biological Availability; biological systems; Blood Pressure; blood pressure regulation; Blood Vessels; cadherin 5; Cardiovascular Diseases; cardiovascular risk factor; Cations; cohort; Complex; Data; Defect; Development; dimer; Dimerization; driving force; Duct (organ) structure; Endothelial Cells; Endothelium; Enterobacteria phage P1 Cre recombinase; Environmental Risk Factor; Equilibrium; Event; Excretory function; Female; Gene Dosage; Genes; Genetic; genetic approach; Genetic Models; genetic variant; genome sequencing; genome wide association study; Genotype; Glycoproteins; Heart Diseases; hemodynamics; high salt diet; Hispanic Community Health Study; Homeostasis; Human; Hypertension; Impairment; In Vitro; in vivo; Inbred SHR Rats; Kidney; Kidney Diseases; Knock-out; Knockout Mice; Link; Lithium; male; Manuscripts; Mediating; Methodology; mimetics; Molecular; Molecular Chaperones; molecular domain; mouse model; Mus; Mutagenesis; Nitric Oxide; Nitric Oxide Synthase Type I; novel; Participant; Pathogenesis; Peripheral; Pharmacology; Population; Population Genetics; Population Study; pressure; Production; public health relevance; Publishing; Rattus; receptor; Receptor Signaling; Renal Blood Flow; renal epithelium; Renal Tissue; Renin-Angiotensin System; Reporting; Resistance; Risk Factors; Rodent; salt sensitive; salt sensitive hypertension; Signal Transduction; Single Nucleotide Polymorphism; Site; Sodium; Sodium Chloride; Sodium-Restricted Diet; Statistical Methods; stroke; Superoxide Dismutase; Superoxides; Supplementation; Tamoxifen; Testing; Tissues; trafficking; trait; Transgenic Mice; Translating; Transplantation; uptake; Variant; Vascular Endothelium; Vascular resistance; vasoconstriction; whole genome; X Chromosome; X Inactivation; ","Renal Mechanisms of Blood Pressure Regulation and Salt Sensitivity by Collectrin","113632","KMBD","Kidney Molecular Biology and Genitourinary Organ Development ","","A1","01","229890","130500","360390",""

Preclinical studies (and preliminary data presented herein) have shown that nicotine (the principal e-liquid's ingredient) can cause OS, exacerbation of cerebral ischemia and secondary brain injury 52-54. Likewise, chronic e-Cig vaping could be prodromal to cerebrovascular impairment and promote the onset of stroke and post- ischemic brain injury as also suggested by our initial findings. However, the health impact of e-Cigs vaping is currently unknown and the substantial lack of toxicological and comparative research has become a critical public concern which greatly hinders the development of FDA regulatory/safety guidelines and need to be addressed. In this respect the Surgeon General issued a new report raising public health concerns about e?Cig use among US youth and young adults and a call to action to expand research efforts related to e?Cigs?. The bulk of research data on TS toxicity at the cerebrovascular system originated by our group during the current funding period along with the methodological approaches we developed to address the study needs in the same continuum afford us a unique position to tackle this issue. Furthermore, recent reports have shown that metformin (MF) treatment before and after ischemic injury reduces stress and inhibits inflammatory responses. Recent preliminary data reveals that MF promotes the activation of counteractive mechanisms mediated by the activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) which drastically reduce TS toxicity at the brain and cerebrovascular levels and protect BBB integrity. Therefore we will be assessing whether MF could be used to reduce the risk of cerebrovascular damage promoted by TS and possibly e-Cig vaping. Potential benefit of MF could be extended as prophylactic care during the time window required for the renomalization of the risk levels of stroke following smoking cessation. Based on these premises, the overarching hypothesis is that excessive OS caused by TS and e-Cig dysregulation of the cellular antioxidant response system is the linking underling mechanism prodromal to cerebrovascular toxicity and highten risk and/or severity of stroke. Therefore, the objectives of our study are:1) Assess the potential cerebrovascular pathogenic impact of e-Cig vaping in respect to TS through a side by side comparative study and inform the regulatory agency (FDA) accordingly; 2)Assess the molecular mechanisms (Nrf2/mitochondrial focused) driving TS-dependent impairment of the BBB and enhanced risk stroke; 3) Assess the viability and effectiveness of MF to prevent/reduce TS and possibly e-Cig vaping-induced BBB damage and subsequent ischemic stroke injury. The proposed studies will benefit the millions of chronic smokers (including early stage former smokers and vapers) which are on the rise in US. Specifically we will: A) Assess the potential cerebrovascular pathogenic impact of e-Cig vaping and TS in a side by side comparative study (both in vitro and in vivo). B) Evaluate in vivo the effect of prophylactic versus therapeutic (post-ischemic) administration of metformin in reducing TS or e-Cig vaping - promoted cerebrovascular impairment and/or post-ischemic neuronal damage.

In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that alterations in chromatin states play a causal role in a variety of cancers. During S phase, chromatin structure is temporarily disrupted and disassembled in order for DNA replication to proceed. Following passage of the replication fork, distinct chromatin states marked by different histone modifications must be restored, which is a daunting challenge for cells. However, it is largely unknown how epigenetically determined chromatin states are inherited during S phase of the cell cycle. In this proposal, we will employ the novel method that we developed to detect whether a protein binds to leading or lagging strands of DNA replication forks, to study how parental (H3-H4)2 are assembled into nucleosomes, the 'first step' of inheritance of higher-order chromatin structure in both yeast and in human cells. These studies will not only provide an unprecedented insight into nucleosome assembly of parental (H3-H4)2, but also potentially increase our understanding of the contributions of epigenetic alterations to the development of human cancers.","7931342; ","ZHANG, ZHIGUO ;","CARTER, ANTHONY D.","09/01/2016","07/31/2021","Binding Proteins; Biochemical; Cell Cycle; Cell division; Cells; Chromatin; Chromatin Structure; Complex; Coupled; daughter cell; Defect; Development; DNA; DNA biosynthesis; DNA Repair; DNA replication fork; Epigenetic Process; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Transcription; genome integrity; Genomic approach; Genomic Instability; Heterochromatin; Higher Order Chromatin Structure; Histone H3; histone modification; Human; Inherited; insight; Malignant Neoplasms; Mammalian Cell; Methods; Mitotic; Molecular; Monitor; Mutation; novel; Nucleosomes; Peptide Sequence Determination; Play; Process; Proteins; public health relevance; RNA; Role; S Phase; Time; transmission process; Yeasts; ","Mechanisms of Epigenetic inheritance","118015","ZGM1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","S1","02","42015","","42015",""

We have recently shown in mice that the timing of an immune system hormone (cytokine) called interferon beta can determine whether T cells of the immune system will help stimulate or prevent an immune reaction. We propose to expand upon how this happens in humans by studying T cells from multiple sclerosis (MS) patients who receive interferon beta as part of their medical care. We will additionally determine in mice if interferon beta pretreatment can prevent an immune reaction to subsequently administered antibodies, including the biologic drug adalimumab, and thus pave the way for a trial of interferon beta pretreatment in human biologic drug recipients.","1857806; ","ZIEGLER, STEVEN F;","BOURCIER, KATARZYNA ","08/16/2017","07/31/2019","adalimumab; Antibodies; Antigens; base; Biological Products; Caring; CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes; Cell Differentiation process; Cell physiology; Cell Surface Receptors; clinical care; clinical practice; Clinical Trials; cytokine; Development; Disease; Effectiveness; Exposure to; Flowers; FOXP3 gene; Future; Hormones; Human; Immune; Immune system; Immune Tolerance; immunogenicity; immunoreaction; in vivo; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Interferon Type I; Interferon-beta; Interferons; Mediating; Medical; Methods; multiple sclerosis patient; Mus; neutralizing antibody; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacologic Substance; Phenotype; Poly C; Poly I-C; Pre-Clinical Model; prevent; Proteins; Regulatory T-Lymphocyte; Safety; T cell differentiation; T-Cell Activation; T-Lymphocyte; Th1 Cells; Time; time interval; transcriptome; Work; ","Generating tolerance to antibody-based drugs","129192","TTT","Transplantation, Tolerance, and Tumor Immunology ","","","01","150000","105000","255000",""

This is because there are no effective therapies, in part because the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Ischemia/reperfusion (IR) is the leading cause of acute kidney injury. There is increasing evidence that meprins, enzymes that are abundantly expressed in the kidneys, contribute to acute kidney injury, but the mechanisms involved are poorly defined. This project focuses on understanding the role of meprins in the pathology of ischemia/reperfusion (IR)-induced kidney injury. The proposed studies will use meprin knockout mice to determine how meprins impact inflammation and fibrosis in ischemia/reperfusion- induced kidney injury.

We believe these glial cells play important roles in synaptic changes that occur in aging, in muscular dystrophy, and in repairs that occur after nerve injury and that understanding this signaling will aid in the treatment of these changes.","1905617; ","THOMPSON, WESLEY J;","NUCKOLLS, GLEN H.","06/01/1984","07/31/2020","Adult; Aging; Animals; Antibodies; Axon; Behavior; Behavior Control; cell behavior; Cell Death; Cells; Cholinergic Receptors; Development; Disease; disease phenotype; Electron Microscopy; Event; Excision; experimental study; Family; fetal; Fiber; follow-up; genetic manipulation; Genetic Transcription; Grant; Image; in vivo; Knockout Mice; Knowledge; Ligands; Light; light microscopy; Link; Maintenance; mature animal; Membrane; Microscopic; Molecular Biology; Monitor; Morphology; Motor; Motor Neurons; Mus; Muscle; Muscle denervation procedure; Muscle Fibers; Muscular Dystrophies; myelination; Neonatal; neonate; Nerve; nerve injury; nerve supply; Nervous system structure; neural circuit; Neuregulin 1; Neuregulins; Neuroglia; neuromuscular; Neuromuscular Diseases; Neuromuscular Junction; neuromuscular transmission; neurotransmission; Other Genetics; overexpression; Peripheral Nerves; Peripheral Nervous System; Phagocytes; Phagocytosis; Physiology; Play; postnatal; prevent; Process; protein expression; Protein Isoforms; receptor; Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases; Recording of previous events; repaired; response; Role; Schwann Cells; Series; Signal Transduction; Signaling Molecule; Spinal Cord; Structure; Synapses; Synaptic Cleft; synaptic function; Testing; Transgenic Mice; Up-Regulation; Western Blotting; Work; ","Formation and maintenance of neuromuscular synaptic connections","020480","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","29","218750","102254","321004",""

This typically results in higher metastatic burden, limited treatment options, and high mortality. The research proposed offers the hypothesis that the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) pathway may be a target for the treatment of metastatic cancers. Soldiers work in conditions that can promote and aggravate cancers. Approximately 40,000 new cases of cancer are diagnosed yearly by the VA health systems, many of these with service related connections. Of these new cases, the five most prevalent are prostate, lung, colon, bladder and melanoma. The mortality is attributed to the metastasis and growth distant to the primary site. Data from the VA Central Cancer Registry (VACCR) suggests that 175,000 patients are treated yearly, of which a majority have greater metastasis and invasive disease. Development and implementation of new treatments for Veterans with metastatic cancer is the goal of this proposal.","11375259; ","OWENS, PHILIP ;","","07/01/2016","06/30/2021","Acute; Adaptive Immune System; adaptive immunity; Area; base; Bladder; bone; bone cell; Bone Diseases; Bone Morphogenetic Proteins; bone sialoprotein; Breast Cancer Model; Calcitonin; cancer diagnosis; Cardiovascular system; Cell Differentiation process; Cell Lineage; Cell physiology; Cell Proliferation; cell type; Characteristics; Chronic; Colon; Complex; Data; Development; Disease; Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm; Distant; Drug Delivery Systems; effective therapy; experimental study; fight against; Flow Cytometry; General Population; Genetically Engineered Mouse; Goals; Growth; Health system; Histopathology; Human; Immune; immune activation; immune function; Immune response; Immunologic Surveillance; Impairment; Implant; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; inhibitor/antagonist; Injection of therapeutic agent; Killings; Lesion; Leukocytes; Long-Term Effects; Lung; macrophage; Malignant neoplasm of prostate; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; Medicine; melanoma; Metastatic Neoplasm to the Bone; Metastatic Prostate Cancer; mimicry; mortality; mouse model; Mus; Myelogenous; Myeloid Cell Suppression; Myeloid Cells; Natural immunosuppression; Natural Killer Cells; Neoplasm Metastasis; neoplasm registry; neoplastic cell; NK Cell Activation; novel; novel therapeutic intervention; Osteoblasts; Osteocalcin; Osteoclasts; outcome forecast; Palliative Care; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pharmacology; Phenotype; Phosphotransferases; pre-clinical; prevent; Process; Prostate; prostate cancer cell; Prostatic Neoplasms; Protein Inhibition; public health relevance; Receptor Signaling; Research; restoration; Scientist; Services; Signaling Protein; Site; skeletal; small molecule; Soldier; Source; standard of care; targeted treatment; Testing; Toxicology; Transgenic Mice; Treatment outcome; Treatment-Related Cancer; tumor; Tumor Cell Invasion; Tumor Cell Migration; Tumor Expansion; Tumor Promotion; tumorigenic; Tumorigenicity; Veterans; Work; Zoledronic Acid; ","Targeting the BMP pathway in metastatic cancer","002929","ONCD","Oncology D ","","","02","","","",""

The main objective of this proposal is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms associated with post- translational modifications (PTMs) located at the C-terminal tail of two phosphatase enzymes, PTEN and MKP- 1. To accomplish this goal, we will generate semi-synthetic enzymes with the site-specific insertion of stoichiometric levels of the corresponding known PTMs and non-hydrolyzable mimics in order to evaluate their roles in regulating enzyme structure and function. These findings are vital to our understanding of how and why diseases such as cancer exploit abnormalities in protein PTMs to promote disease progression and can pave the way for the rational design of new therapies for the treatment of different cancers.","14079349; ","DEMPSEY, DANIEL R.;","BARSKI, OLEG ","08/16/2016","08/15/2018","Acetylation; Alkaline Phosphatase; amino group; atomic interactions; autism spectrum disorder; Binding; Biochemical; Biological Assay; C-terminal; Cell physiology; Cellular Assay; Computer Simulation; crosslink; Crystallization; design; Disease; Disease Progression; DUSP1 gene; enzyme activity; enzyme structure; Enzymes; Event; experimental study; extracellular; Family; Generations; Goals; human disease; improved; JUN gene; Ligation; Light; Link; Lipid Binding; Lipids; loss of function; Malignant Neoplasms; MAP Kinase Gene; MAPK14 gene; MAPK8 gene; Maps; Membrane Lipids; Methods; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Mitogens; Molecular; Molecular Conformation; Multiple Hamartoma Syndrome; Mutagenesis; mutant; Mutation; new therapeutic target; next generation; novel therapeutics; Pathway interactions; phosphatase-1 kinase; Phosphatidylinositols; Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases; Phosphorylation; Phosphotransferases; PI3K/AKT; Positioning Attribute; Post Translational Modification Analysis; Post-Translational Protein Processing; Protein Dephosphorylation; Protein phosphatase; protein protein interaction; Proteins; Proteome; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; PTEN gene; Regulation; Research; Role; Second Messenger Systems; Series; Serine; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Site; Specificity; Structure; synthetic enzyme; Tail; Techniques; Testing; Therapeutic Intervention; tripolyphosphate; UV induced; ","Structural and Functional Analysis of the Post-translational Modifications of PTEN and MKP-1","120855","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","57066","","57066",""

ISCs must precisely balance differentiation and self-renewal under homeostatic or injury-induced conditions, but the genetic mechanisms the regulate this balance remain poorly understood. The transcription factor Sox9 is a known regulator of cell-differentiation and stem-cell renewal in the intestine, and has recently been shown to preserve radio-resistance and be required for successful tissue repair after radiation-damage. Defining the mechanisms through which Sox9 regulates these essential functions of ISCs is fundamental to understanding the physiology of the intestine, and will inform therapeutic approaches to disease states such as inflammatory bowel disease and cancers that rely on proliferative and regenerative signals.","14743438; ","BANKAITIS, ERIC DANIEL;","DENSMORE, CHRISTINE L","07/01/2017","06/30/2019","Ablation; Adopted; Biological Assay; Cancer Patient; career; cell behavior; Cell Culture System; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell Cycle; Cell Death; Cell Differentiation process; Cell physiology; Cell Proliferation; Cells; Cessation of life; chemotherapy; Chronic; crypt cell; Data; Disease; Down-Regulation; Doxycycline; Epithelium; Equilibrium; Exhibits; experimental study; Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting; Future; Gastrointestinal tract structure; Generations; Genetic; Genetic Models; Goals; high throughput screening; Homeostasis; Image; Image Analysis; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Injury; innovation; interest; intestinal epithelium; Intestines; irradiation; knock-down; Label; Lead; Life Cycle Stages; Maintenance; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; Methods; Mitotic; Modeling; Mucositis; Mus; Natural regeneration; overexpression; Pathway interactions; Phenotype; Physiology; Plasticizers; Population; premature; Process; programs; Proliferating; Property; Radiation; Radiation exposure; Radiation induced damage; Radiation Tolerance; Radioresistance; radioresistant; radiosensitive; regenerative; Regenerative response; repaired; Reserve Stem Cell; Resistance; response; response to injury; Role; self-renewal; Signal Transduction; small hairpin RNA; stem cell division; Stem cells; stemness; Supporting Cell; System; Technology; Testing; Therapeutic; Time; tissue repair; Tissues; Training; transcription factor; transcriptome sequencing; transcriptomics; Transgenic Mice; Transgenic Organisms; ","Sox9 Expression-Thresholds Govern Reserve and Active Intestinal Stem Cell Functions","115016","ZDK1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","58620","","58620",""

The total financial costs of this epidemic are >$560 billion (as stated in PA-16-188). Conventional treatments use a variety of drug regimens but frequently fail to control pain. Targeted gene therapy is an important goal, because it addresses a public health crisis caused by the effects of untargeted, ?systemic? delivery of opioids such as oxycontin acting on the brain. These drugs cause respiratory arrest, hallucinations, and addiction. 18,893 Americans died from prescription opioids in 2014 and 1.9 million were addicted to them; 10,574 died from heroin and 586,000 were users, most of whom were first addicted to prescription opioids. Recent studies in have demonstrated that chronic pain can be controlled by gene therapy, i.e. delivering a therapeutic gene into the cells responsible for pain signaling. These cells are found in small structures located adjacent to the spinal cord called dorsal root ganglia (DRG). The goal of this study is to develop a technique to deliver a gene therapy vector to DRG using clinical computed tomography and MRI technology. The research proposed in this application will allow us to determine the most viable treatment approach for future development for human use with a special focus on severe pain from advanced cancer and severe osteoarthritis.","7165703; ","BEUTLER, ANDREAS S.;","OSHINSKY, MICHAEL L","08/15/2017","07/31/2022","Abnormal Laboratory Test Result; Acute; addiction; Address; adeno-associated viral vector; Advanced Malignant Neoplasm; Adverse effects; Affect; American; Analgesics; Anatomy; Animal Model; Animal Testing; Animals; Behavior; behavior test; beta-Endorphin; Biodistribution; Blood; Brain; Brain Stem; Capsid; Cartilage; Cells; Characteristics; Chronic; chronic pain; Clinical; comparative; Complex; Convection; conventional therapy; cost; Data; Degenerative polyarthritis; Dependovirus; design; Development; Distant; DNA; Dose; Drug Kinetics; Edema; efficacy testing; Engineering; Epidemic; Esthesia; experimental study; Family suidae; Financial cost; Fluoroscopy; Future; Gait; Gene Delivery; Gene Targeting; gene therapy; Gene Transduction Agent; Gene Transfer; Genes; genotoxicity; Goals; Hallucinations; head-to-head comparison; Health; Heroin; Histopathology; Human; Hyperalgesia; Image; image guided; Imaging technology; Immune response; in vivo; Inflammation; Investments; Kinetics; Knee; Knee Osteoarthritis; Lead; Libraries; Liver; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Methodology; Methods; Modeling; Modification; Morphologic artifacts; Mus; Needles; Neuraxis; Neurons; Nociception; Opioid; Opioid Analgesics; Opioid Peptide; opioid use; Oral; Organ; Outcome Measure; Oxycodone; Pain; Pain management; parity; Patients; Peptides; Peripheral Nerves; phantom model; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacology and Toxicology; Population; prescription opioid; Primates; promoter; Protein Isoforms; Public Health; Rattus; Regimen; relating to nervous system; Reporting; Research; Resolution; respiratory; RNA; Rodent Model; screening; secondary outcome; Serotyping; Severities; sex; Signal Transduction; Spinal Cord; Spinal Ganglia; Structure; Syndrome; synergism; Techniques; Technology; Testing; therapeutic gene; Tissues; Toxic effect; Toxicology; transduction efficiency; transgene expression; Validation; Variant; vector; vector genome; Vertebral column; viral RNA; X-Ray Computed Tomography; ","Intraganglionic Analgesic Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) Gene Vector Optimization in Large Animals","100725","GDD","Gene and Drug Delivery Systems Study Section ","","A1","01","459820","206256","666076",""

Currently there is no specific treatment for this disease. Lung vascular leakage may be due to defects in the endothelial cells lining the inner blood vessel wall. Coagulation protease thrombin generated during sepsis plays an important role in altering the calcium level in endothelial cells. The present investigation will investigate how increased calcium concentration activates TAK1 kinase in endothelial cells and how the activated TAK1 kinase repair the leaky lung vessels to normalize lung vascular function.

Their deficiency, caused by a number of heritable genetic defects, leads to severe autoimmune and inflammatory complications that can be life threatening or fatal. Many individuals suffering from TR cell deficiency have mutations in the transcription factor FOXP3, which endows TR cells with their immune regulatory functions. TR cells may also lose FOXP3 expression in the context of chronic inflammation, as seen in a number of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, contributing to the perpetuation of these debilitating conditions. We are proposing to reprogram immune regulatory functions in TR cells lacking FOXP3 by resetting deleterious pathways let loose by its deficiency. Our studies hold the promise of novel therapies that are broadly applicable to disorders of failed immune regulation, including not only genetic deficiency of FOXP3 but also inflammatory and autoimmune diseases common in the general population.","1899390 (contact); 8262476; ","CHATILA, TALAL AMINE (contact); WILLIAMS, CALVIN B;","VOULGAROPOULOU, FROSSO ","08/30/2010","07/31/2021","Abnormal Cell; aerobic glycolysis; Alleles; Alpha Cell; Autoimmune Diseases; Autoimmune Process; Autoimmunity; Automobile Driving; base; Benign; Bioenergetics; Cell Lineage; Cell physiology; Cells; Chronic; comparative; Complex; cytokine; Data; design; Development; Disease; disease phenotype; Elements; Energy Metabolism; enhanced green fluorescent protein; Enterobacteria phage P1 Cre recombinase; environmental agent; Enzymes; Exhibits; experimental study; Failure; Food; FOXO1A gene; FOXP3 gene; FRAP1 gene; Gene Expression Profile; General Population; Genetic; Genetic Transcription; Goals; Graft-vs-Host Disease; Heritability; Human; Immune; Immune response; Immune Tolerance; immunoregulation; Impairment; improved; Individual; Inflammation; Inflammatory; inhibitor/antagonist; Interruption; Intervention; Life; loss of function; loss of function mutation; Lymphoproliferative Disorders; Maintenance; Measures; Mediating; Metabolic; metabolomics; Methylation; Modeling; Molecular; Mus; mutant; Mutation; novel; novel strategies; novel therapeutics; Nuclear; Outcome; Pathogenesis; Pathogenicity; Pathway interactions; Peripheral; Pharmacology; Phenotype; Play; Population; programs; promoter; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Regulation; Regulatory T-Lymphocyte; Reporting; Role; stem; T-Lymphocyte; Therapeutic; therapy design; Thymus Gland; Tissues; tool; transcription factor; ","Mechanisms of Disease Pathogenesis in Regulatory T cell Deficiency","085090","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","07","309564","139034","448598",""

The project will explore a targeted polymeric nanoparticle platform to deliver siRNA to the bone marrow endothelium in vivo, to silence the expression of receptors and factors responsible for the initial tumor cell adhesion and homing that trigger metastasis to bone. This approach offers promising new avenues on disrupting the metastatic bone marrow niche to reduce the capacity of tumor cells to disseminate to bone, while also offering a broadly enabling technology to silence genes in the bone marrow endothelium that contribute to a range of diseases.","12425543; ","MITCHELL, MICHAEL J;","JAKOWLEW, SONIA B","08/13/2015","08/12/2018","adhesion receptor; Adhesions; Adverse effects; Aftercare; Anatomy; Animal Cancer Model; base; Binding; Biological Assay; Blocking Antibodies; Blood; Blood Circulation; bone; Bone Marrow; Bone neoplasms; Breast Cancer Cell; career; Cell Adhesion; Cell Line; Cell membrane; Cells; Cessation of life; Chemotactic Factors; chemotherapy; Clinical; Colon; CXCR4 gene; Disease; Distant; dosage; Down-Regulation; E-Selectin; effective therapy; Encapsulated; Endothelial Cells; Endothelium; Engineering; Event; Flow Cytometry; Fucosyltransferase; Future; Gene Expression; Gene Targeting; Genes; Hepatocyte; Histology; Home environment; Homing; Image; Immune; immunogenic; In Vitro; in vivo; in vivo imaging; Invaded; leukocyte homing; Ligands; Malignant neoplasm of prostate; Malignant Neoplasms; Mentors; Messenger RNA; Metastatic Neoplasm to the Bone; Methods; migration; Modeling; monolayer; Morbidity - disease rate; mouse model; mRNA Expression; Mus; nanoparticle; Neoplasm Metastasis; neoplastic cell; novel; Organ; outcome forecast; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Physiological; Play; Polymers; Population; Prostate; prostate cancer cell; public health relevance; receptor expression; Research; Resistance; RNA Interference Therapy; Role; Series; sialyl Lewis x; Site; Small Interfering RNA; small molecule; Stem cells; Stromal Cell-Derived Factor 1; Structure; Survival Rate; targeted delivery; Technology; Testing; Therapeutic; Training; tumor; Tumor Angiogenesis; Work; ","Polymeric Nanoparticles for siRNA Delivery to Bone Marrow Endothelium to Disrupt Tumor Cell Adhesion and Bone Metastasis Formation In Vivo","200351","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","03","57066","","57066",""

The progressive enlargement of these cysts in affected kidneys leads to renal failure in about half of patients; and patients often have hypertension, cerebral and aortic aneurysms, and heart valve defects, and often die of cardiovascular complications. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) considers PKD to be a high priority disease because of its high prevalence in the population; because of its high morbidity and mortality; and because of the very high costs associated with dialysis, transplantation, and long-term follow-up care. The University of Kansas Medical Center has a tradition of interdisciplinary research in polycystic kidney disease, which began with the recognition that PKD represents an abnormality in the growth and proliferation of kidney tubule cells. While the mechanisms underlying these processes are not completely understood and are still the subject of intense investigation, they have provided a strong rationale for developing PKD therapeutics that can specifically inhibit targets associated with cyst growth and enlargement. As such, the mission of the PKD Center at Kansas is ?The promotion of research leading to a better understanding of polycystic kidney disease and the discovery of targets for therapy and development of clinical trials ultimately for improved patient outcomes.? Basic research conducted at the University of Kansas identified the intracellular second messenger cyclic AMP as the key abnormality driving both cyst growth and cyst-filling fluid secretion, and that research led to the development of tolvaptan for therapy. The success of the tolvaptan clinical trial attests to the effectiveness of our approach, which starts with target identification followed by studies to better understand the broader physiology. While we are now beginning to understand the fundamental cyst growth mechanism sufficiently well to focus drug development on cyclic AMP stimulated pathways, we are also exploring and investigating other fundamental mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis and progression of PKD with the goal of discovering new targets for drug development and PKD therapy. We believe that PKD is a very unique disease and thus will offer many challenges for therapy, as drugs will have to be efficacious as well as safe over decades, and ultimately it would be best to treat PKD in its earliest stages, and thus we have emphasized early and childhood PKD in our proposal. The Kansas PKD Research and Translation Core Center is offering four highly innovative biomedical research cores and pilot and feasibility research opportunities related to the theme ?Target identification for PKD therapy development.? These cores are the following: the Gene Targeting Core will offer expert CRISPR/TALEN gene editing in Pkd1 hypomorphic background strains to discover and validate PKD pathway interacting proteins and signaling components both in vivo and in cell culture for the identification of new targets for drug development; the Epigenetics Core will offer a range of reagents, tools, resources, and expertise to genetically test the role of epigenetic regulators in controlling known PKD signaling pathways or for the discovery of new pathways that can be targeted for drug development; the Biomarkers Core will develop a repository of blood and urine samples from a cohort of early-stage PKD patients for the discovery and evaluation of serum, urine, and urinary exosome biomarkers specific to early PKD, with the involvement of Myriad-RBM to develop and validate, rapid biomarker testing for PKD therapy development; and the Clinical Research Core will develop clinical trials services and platforms that will help investigator-initiated efforts bring drugs into patient trials by offering consultative services, a PKD patient registry, clinical resources and personnel to help in conducting trials, and a user-friendly, multi-site, data-rich PKD database for observational studies. The Kansas PKD Core Center is also offering five pilot and feasibility grants per year and an educational enrichment program to maximize the development of research related to the Core Center theme and to accelerate the growth of the biomedical research cores and the training of new PKD physician- scientists.","1868909; ","CALVET, JAMES P;","MOXEY-MIMS, MARVA M.","09/15/2015","06/30/2020","Affect; Aortic Aneurysm; Automobile Driving; base; Basic Science; Biochemistry; Biological Markers; Biomedical Research; Blood; Cardiovascular system; Caring; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell physiology; Cells; Cellular biology; Cerebral Aneurysm; Clinical; clinical development; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials; Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats; cohort; Collaborations; Communities; Consultations; cost; Cyclic AMP; Cyst; Data; Databases; Defect; Development; Dialysis procedure; Disease; Disease Pathway; drug development; Drug Targeting; early childhood; Educational process of instructing; Effectiveness; Environment; epigenetic marker; Epigenetic Process; Evaluation; exosome; Fluids and Secretions; follow-up; Foundations; Gene Targeting; Genes; Goals; Grant; Growth; Heart Valves; High Prevalence; Human Resources; Hypertension; improved; in vivo; Inherited; innovation; insight; Institution; Interdisciplinary Study; Intracellular Second Messenger; Investigation; Kansas; Kidney; Kidney Failure; Liquid substance; Medical center; meetings; Mission; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; multidisciplinary; new technology; new therapeutic target; novel; novel therapeutics; Observational Study; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; patient oriented; Patient-Focused Outcomes; patient/disease registry; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Physicians; Physiology; Polycystic Kidney Diseases; Population; Process; programs; Proteins; Reagent; Recording of previous events; Renal tubule structure; repository; Research; research and development; Research Infrastructure; Research Personnel; Research Project Grants; Resource Sharing; Resources; Role; Sampling; Scientist; Second Messenger Systems; Serum; Services; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Site; specific biomarkers; success; symposium; targeted treatment; Technology; Testing; Therapeutic; therapy development; tolvaptan; tool; Training; translational medicine; Translational Research; Translations; Transplantation; United States National Institutes of Health; Universities; urinary; Urine; user-friendly; ","Kansas PKD Research and Translation Core Center","106912","ZDK1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","03","726145","349194","1075339",""

The environmental and genetic factors that drive susceptibility to the development of PH and responses to therapy are poorly understood. Additionally, little is known about the impact of ethnicity on disease severity. These information gaps are exacerbated by the perplexing assortment of clinical characteristics, histopathological entities and responses to therapy that constitute the 5 categories within the current World Symposium classification of PH patients. This proposal will redefine the PH classification by integrating clinical assessment with state-of-the-art physiologic, genomic and epigenetic strategies in order to improve diagnosis, prognosis and therapy. This is particularly true for specific populations (e.g., blacks and Latinos) that are potentially at great risk for PH development with greater disease severity. These highly translational studies will generate novel category-specific biomarkers in this devastating pulmonary vascular disease and hold promise for a) identifying groups at high-risk for development of PH, b) personalizing PH therapies (combination therapy, transplant or surgical referral), and c) providing the rationale for novel PH classification paradigms. Thus, a better understanding of the disease processes could help to reduce morbidity and mortality from this devastating condition.","12103963 (contact); 1864621; ","RISCHARD, FRANZ P (contact); YUAN, JASON X J;","XIAO, LEI ","09/15/2014","07/31/2019","Admixture; African American; Algorithms; Arizona; Arts; base; biobank; Biological Markers; biomedical referral center; Blood Vessels; Cardiac; Cardiopulmonary; Categories; Catheterization; Cessation of life; Characteristics; Chronic; Classification; Clinical; Clinical assessments; clinical diagnostics; clinical phenotype; clinical practice; cohort; Combined Modality Therapy; Complex; Coupling; Deterioration; Development; Diagnosis; Disease; DNA Methylation; Echocardiography; electric impedance; Epigenetic Process; Ethnic Origin; Evaluation; Exercise; experience; Failure; Gene Expression; Generations; Genes; Genetic; genome sequencing; genome wide association study; genome-wide; genomic signature; Genomics; Graft Rejection; Hamman-Rich syndrome; Heart Diseases; high risk; Hispanics; Hypoxemia; improved; Incidence; Latino; Left; Lung; Lung diseases; Lung Transplantation; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; male; Measurement; Measures; Medical center; MicroRNAs; Molecular Profiling; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Native Americans; novel; Operative Surgical Procedures; outcome forecast; Patients; Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell; personalized medicine; phenomics; Phenotype; Physiological; Population; Predisposition; pressure; primary pulmonary hypertension; Process; programs; Publishing; pulmonary arterial hypertension; Pulmonary Hypertension; Pulmonary Vascular Resistance; Quality of life; response; Risk; Sarcoidosis; Scleroderma; Severities; Severity of illness; Sickle Cell Anemia; Single Nucleotide Polymorphism; specific biomarkers; Subgroup; survival prediction; symposium; Time; tool; translational approach; translational study; Transplantation; treatment center; Universities; Vascular Diseases; Vascular remodeling; vasoconstriction; Ventricular; whole genome; Workload; ","Phenomic and genomic study to subphenotype Hispanics with pulmonary hypertension","125208","ZHL1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","04","200000","107000","307000",""

Mtb secretes cAMP into host macrophages during infection as a pathogenic strategy to disrupt the host response to infection, making it critical to understand the factors that control cAMP secretion by Mtb and the means by which it affects host signaling. This work will identify factors required for cAMP secretion by Mtb, while developing robust tools for detailed characterization of the mechanisms by which cAMP secretion by Mtb contributes to pathogenesis so that potential points of new intervention can be discovered.","1884149; ","MCDONOUGH, KATHLEEN A;","KRAIGSLEY, ALISON ","08/18/2017","07/31/2019","Address; Adenylate Cyclase; Affect; Antigens; Bacteria; Bacterial Genes; base; Binding; Biochemical; Biological; Biological Assay; Biological Markers; Biology; Bioluminescence; Cell membrane; Cell Membrane Permeability; Cells; Cues; Cyclic AMP; Cyclic Nucleotides; Cytoplasm; Cytosol; Disease; Disease Progression; Environment; Epidemic; Fibrinogen; Fluorescence; Future; Gene Expression Regulation; Genes; genetic approach; global health; Goals; Immune response; immunocytochemistry; improved; Infection; innovation; Intervention; Knowledge; loss of function; macrophage; Mediating; microbial; Microscopy; Molecular Genetics; Mutagenesis; mutant; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Nature; Outcome; pathogen; Pathogenesis; Pathogenicity; Pathway interactions; Pilot Projects; Play; Process; Proteins; Reporter; Research Infrastructure; Resources; response; Role; Second Messenger Systems; Signal Transduction; Signaling Molecule; specific biomarkers; Testing; Time; tool; Tuberculosis; Virulence; Work; ","Cyclic AMP secretion mechanisms in M. tuberculosis","131679","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","150000","105824","255824",""

There is no cure for CTD, but the symptoms are often managed with pharmacotherapies. Such medications are moderately effective for reducing tics for some, but high rates of side effects limit their use and often result in poor adherence. A non-pharmacological treatment known as Comprehensive Behavioral Interventions for Tics (CBIT) has shown results similar to those achieved with pharmacotherapy. CBIT is desired by patients/parents, but is not widely available. Surveys of families with CTD have shown that only 6% of treatment-seeking children/families and 4% of treatment seeking adults have received CBIT. While most respondents desired CBIT, a lack of providers trained in CBIT was among the most commonly cited barriers to receiving treatment. Surveys of mental health practitioners confirm that few professionals have been trained in CBIT and a high demand for CBIT training. Combined, these data highlight the need for novel therapist training strategies in order to increase the availability of CBIT for CTD. In the proposed project, we will use competency-based training methods and an iterative expert and end-user informed process to CBIT into a novel, online program for training therapists to administer CBIT (CBIT-Trainer). In addition to being universally available to any therapist with Internet access, CBIT-Trainer has the potential to significantly lower the cost of therapist training. An online training program also has distinct advantages over intensive in-person training methods including an individualized pace of training, ongoing continuing education, real-time practice updates, and the ability to incorporate technology to provide ongoing peer support and expert consultation. Finally, we will begin to identify and address, early in the product development process, needs and barriers among multiple stakeholders (providers, center directors) in order to proactively identify and address potential implementation barriers (e.g., therapist attitudes, organizational characteristics) that might impede adoption.","10254243; 10895834 (contact); 6614326; ","HIMLE, MICHAEL B; MOUTON-ODUM, SUZANNE  (contact); WOODS, DOUGLAS W;","HAIM, ADAM ","08/16/2017","01/31/2019","Address; Adherence; Adoption; Adult; Adverse effects; Affect; Americas; Attitude; base; Behavior Disorders; Behavior Therapy; Characteristics; Child; Chronic; clinical care; Competence; Computers; Consultations; Continuing Education; cost; Data; design; Development; Disease; Education; effective intervention; Effectiveness; efficacy testing; Elements; evidence base; Evidence based practice; Family; Feedback; functional disability; Funding; Gilles de la Tourette syndrome; health care model; Healthcare Systems; Impairment; improved; improved outcome; Individual; innovation; Institutes; Internet; Intervention; Lead; Letters; Mental disorders; Mental Health; Methods; Mission; Modeling; National Institute of Mental Health; National Research Council; neuropsychiatric disorder; novel; Parents; Patients; peer; peer support; Persons; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacotherapy; Phase; Phonation; Physicians; Population; Privatization; Process; product development; programs; Protocols documentation; prototype; Provider; Psychologist; psychosocial; Public Health; Quality of life; Randomized Controlled Trials; repetitive behavior; Reporting; Research; Resources; Respondent; satisfaction; skills; Small Business Innovation Research Grant; social; Surveys; Symptoms; Techniques; Technology; Telephone; Testing; Therapeutic; Tic disorder; tic-related; Time; Training; Training and Education; Training Programs; Training Support; Update; usability; Wood material; ","Development and initial testing of CBIT-Trainer: An interactive online program for training therapists in comprehensive behavioral intervention for tic disorders","111450","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","01","","","224564",""

Furthermore, it has been studied in preclinical models of cancer and is entering into the clinic for these applications. However, there are in general major delivery barriers that hinder the extension of gene therapies to glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a particularly aggressive form of glioma with very poor survival prognosis due in part to the persistence of therapy-resistant, highly invasive tumor-initiating cells (TICs) that preclude complete surgical tumor removal. To address these challenges, we propose to apply our novel directed evolution approach to engineer optimized AAV vectors capable of highly efficient delivery of both marker and therapeutic genes to human GBM tumor cells and TICs in a murine xenograft model, work with implications for the development of next generation cancer therapies.","2242041; ","SCHAFFER, DAVID V;","RAMPULLA, DAVID ","09/16/2016","07/31/2018","Address; adeno-associated viral vector; Adult; Anatomy; Animal Model; Animals; antiangiogenesis therapy; Apoptosis; Astrocytoma; base; Biodistribution; Biological; Blood - brain barrier anatomy; Brain Neoplasms; brain parenchyma; cancer immunotherapy; Cancer Model; cancer therapy; Capsid Proteins; Cells; chemotherapy; Clinic; Clinical; clinical translation; Clinical Trials; conventional therapy; Dependovirus; Development; Diagnosis; Diffuse; Directed Molecular Evolution; Disease; Distal; Engineering; Essential Genes; Evolution; Excision; experience; extracellular; Familial Lipoprotein Lipase Deficiency; Future; Gene Delivery; Gene Library; gene therapy; Generations; Genetic; Genetic Enhancement; Glioblastoma; Glioma; Growth; Hemophilia A; Herpesviridae; Human; Immune checkpoint blockade; Immunocompromised Host; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; in vivo Model; Individual; Injectable; Injection of therapeutic agent; Intervention; Leber's amaurosis; Libraries; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; Medical; Mendelian disorder; Modeling; Molecular; Molecular Virology; mouse model; Mus; Neoplasm Metastasis; neoplastic cell; Neuraxis; next generation; novel; novel strategies; Oncolytic; Operative Surgical Procedures; outcome forecast; particle; Patients; Pre-Clinical Model; Primary Brain Neoplasms; Property; Protein Engineering; Radiation; Recovery; response; Safety; Series; success; Suicide; System; targeted delivery; targeted treatment; Therapeutic; therapeutic gene; therapeutic target; therapy resistant; Time; Tissues; trafficking; transgene expression; Treatment Efficacy; Tropism; tumor; tumor growth; Tumor Initiators; tumor progression; Vaccinia; Variant; vector; Viral; Viral Genome; Viral Vector; virtual; Virus; Work; Xenograft Model; Xenograft procedure; ","In Vivo Directed Evolution of Adeno-Associated Virus Vectors for Glioblastoma Multiforme Tumor-Initiating Cells","021572","GDD","Gene and Drug Delivery Systems Study Section ","","","02","150000","74564","224564",""

The ultimate goal of this renewal of the Center is to identify therapeutic targets for alleviation of the depressive and stressful aspects of withdrawal that we consider are primary drivers for addiction to opioid drugs.","1861675; ","EVANS, CHRISTOPHER J;","BERTON, OLIVIER ROLAND","09/30/1987","06/30/2022","addiction; Agonist; Alcohols; Amygdaloid structure; Analgesics; Anhedonia; animal breeding; Antibodies; Anxiety; Area; Behavior; Behavioral; Brain; brain circuitry; Cannabinoids; Cell Line; Cells; Cessation of life; chronic pain; Clone Cells; Cloning; Communities; Comorbidity; Corpus striatum structure; cost effective; depressive symptoms; Development; Devices; Disease; drug of abuse; dysphoria; Education and Outreach; educational atmosphere; Electrodes; Electrophysiology (science); Endogenous Opiates; Ensure; Euphoria; Faculty; faculty research; Fc Receptor; Female; Food; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Funding; Future; Genetic; Genotype; Goals; Habenula; hedonic; Heroin; Homeostasis; Human Resources; Image; in vivo; in vivo calcium imaging; Informatics; innovation; Institutes; International; Investments; Knock-in; Knockout Mice; Leadership; Light; Link; Logistics; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; male; Mediating; meetings; member; Mental Depression; Methods; Microdialysis; Microscope; miniaturize; Mission; Modeling; Monitor; mouse model; mu opioid receptors; multidisciplinary; Mus; mutant; Mutant Strains Mice; neuroinflammation; new technology; Nicotine; novel; Opiate Addiction; Opiates; Opioid; Opioid Peptide; Opioid Receptor; opioid withdrawal; optogenetics; outreach; outreach program; Overdose; Oxycodone; Pain; painful neuropathy; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pilot Projects; Poisoning; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders; pre-clinical; pre-clinical research; Predisposition; programs; Publications; Publishing; Reagent; receptor; Recording of previous events; Regulation; Research; Research Personnel; Research Project Grants; Resources; Rest; Rewards; Rodent; Role; Stress; stress related disorder; System; Techniques; Technology; Therapeutic; therapeutic target; trafficking; Training; Training Programs; Transcript; transcriptome; United States National Institutes of Health; Update; Visit; Wireless Technology; Withdrawal; ","Center for Study of Opioid Receptors and Drugs of Abuse (CSORDA)","005010","ZDA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","31","1085329","517511","1602840",""

The research proposed in this application is aimed at increasing our understanding of mechanisms by which As3+ induces reprogramming of the lung epithelial cells to generated cancer stem cells (CSCs). Main efforts will be on the role of As3+-induced JNK-dependent phosphorylation of serine 727 of STAT3 (pSTAT3S727) on the inhibition of ROS and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in mitochondria that promotes the generation of the CSCs. Results from these studies are anticipated to generate new concepts indicating that induction of CSCs is the central mechanism of As3+-induced human cancer. The proposed preclinical testing of targeting therapy on JNK, STAT3 and glycolysis in unique orthotopic mouse model of lung cancer mimics relevant molecular and clinical features of the human cancer, which has the potential of identifying new target-based strategies of cancer therapy.","8832153; ","CHEN, FEI ;","SHAUGHNESSY, DANIEL ","08/15/2017","06/30/2022","Address; Aerobic; alkalinity; Area; Argentina; Arsenic; Bangladesh; base; Biochemical; cancer cell; Cancer Model; Cancer stem cell; cancer therapy; carcinogenesis; carcinogenicity; Carcinogens; Cell Line; cell transformation; Cells; Characteristics; Chemicals; Chile; China; Clinical; clinically relevant; Cytoplasm; Data; Deposition; DNA Binding; DNA biosynthesis; DNA Methylation; drinking water; embryonic stem cell; Environmental Exposure; Epidemiology; Epithelial Cells; Etiology; Exhibits; exposed human population; Exposure to; Generations; Genes; Genetic Transcription; Glycolysis; Goals; ground water; histone methylation; Human; Impairment; India; inhibitor/antagonist; International Agency for Research on Cancer; JNK-activating protein kinase; Lead; Link; Lung; Malignant - descriptor; Malignant neoplasm of liver; Malignant neoplasm of lung; Malignant neoplasm of prostate; Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder; Malignant Neoplasms; MAPK8 gene; Metabolic; Metabolism; metabolomics; Metals; Mexico; Mitochondria; Mitochondrial DNA; mitochondrial metabolism; Mitochondrial Proteins; Molecular; Mongolia; mouse model; mtTF1 transcription factor; Mus; NOD/SCID mouse; Oxidative Phosphorylation; Pathway interactions; Phosphorylation; Planet Earth; Population; pre-clinical; Preclinical Testing; Production; Proteome; Public Health; Reactive Inhibition; Reactive Oxygen Species; Regimen; Research; response; Role; S-Adenosylhomocysteine; Serine; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Skin Cancer; STAT3 gene; stem; stemness; Taiwan; targeted agent; targeted treatment; Testing; Therapeutic; therapeutic evaluation; transcriptomics; tumor; upstream kinase; ","Reduced reactive oxygen species and oxidative phosphorylation in arsenic-induced cancer stem cells","028263","SIEE","Systemic Injury by Environmental Exposure ","","","01","225000","112277","337277",""

Multidimensional measures of dependence may be more useful, but research on dependence among Spanish-speaking smokers is hampered by a lack of psychometrically sound Spanish-language measures of dependence. Development of valid, multidimensional assessments of dependence among Spanish-speaking Mexican-origin smokers, who represent the largest proportion of Latino smokers, would allow for the conduct of research that could lead to novel, culturally relevant knowledge of the processes involved in smoking initiation, maintenance, cessation and relapse. It stands to improve interventions tailored to or targeted at Latino smokers by informing more culturally appropriate assessment of nicotine dependence. Advancing knowledge in these areas would help to identify treatment targets, improve current smoking cessation interventions, and ultimately aid in eliminating tobacco-related health disparities among Latinos.","10099956; ","CASTRO, YESSENIA ;","ROSARIO, ADELAIDA M","08/14/2017","04/30/2019","addiction; Address; Area; base; Behavioral; Cessation Research; Cigarette; Cognitive; cognitive testing; Data; Dependence; Development; Dimensions; Drug Modelings; drug relapse; Drug usage; Equipment and supply inventories; experience; Factor Analysis; General Population; health disparity; improved; instrument; Intervention; Interview; Knowledge; Language; Latino; Lead; Linguistics; Mainstreaming; Maintenance; Measures; Methods; Mexican; Nicotine; Nicotine Dependence; novel; Outcome; Pattern; Phase; Physical Dependence; Population; Process; Property; Proxy; Psychometrics; Public Health; Relapse; Research; Sampling; Severities; Smoke; Smoker; Smoking; smoking cessation; Smoking Cessation Intervention; smoking prevalence; smoking relapse; sound; Structure; Syndrome; theories; Tobacco; Tobacco Dependence; Tobacco smoking; Tobacco use; Translating; Translations; Validation; Wisconsin; Withholding Treatment; Work; ","Assessing Smoking Dependence Among Spanish-speaking Latino Smokers","011431","ARM","Addiction Risks and Mechanisms Study Section ","","A1","01","157143","84407","241550",""

Treatments that reduce tau phosphorylation are hypothesized to block and potentially reverse pathogenesis and disease progression. Avanti Biosciences is pioneering the development of potent negative allosteric modulators of DYRK1A, a kinase that phosphorylates tau and whose activity is plausibly linked to p-tau mediated synaptic and neuronal dysfunction and death in AD. In collaboration with NY Institute for Basic Research, Avanti has identified catechins that negatively modulate the activity of DYRK1A, suggesting that potent allosteric inhibition of DYRK1A can be achieved. The requested funding will enable preparation and testing of potent new catechin analogs of these small molecules with improved metabolic stability and brain bioavailability. These early studies will facilitate future work to optimize and develop advanced compounds for preclinical studies and eventual AD clinical trials. An optimized DYRK1A kinase modulator IND candidate that reduces tau phosphorylation would significantly expand the portfolio of treatments to reverse AD symptoms and block disease progression.","14244566 (contact); 1889266; ","ARALDI, GIAN LUCA  (contact); HWANG, YU-WEN ;","REFOLO, LORENZO ","08/15/2017","07/31/2018","Acute; Adaptive Behaviors; Adenosine Triphosphate; Alzheimer's Disease; analog; Animals; base; Basic Science; Behavior; Binding Proteins; Biological; Biological Assay; Biological Availability; Biological Sciences; Brain; Caco-2 Cells; Canis familiaris; Catechin; Cell Nucleus; Chromosome abnormality; clinical development; Clinical Trials; Cognition; cognitive function; cognitive performance; Collaborations; Cytoplasm; Data; Deposition; design; Development; Disease; Disease Progression; Dose; Down Syndrome; Drug Industry; Drug Kinetics; efficacy study; entorhinal cortex; Epigallocatechin Gallate; Evaluation; Event; Filament; Foundations; Functional disorder; Funding; Future; gallocatechol; genotoxicity; Green tea; Hepatocyte; Hippocampus (Brain); Human; hydroxyl group; hyperphosphorylated tau; immunoreactivity; improved; In Vitro; in vitro activity; in vivo; inhibitor/antagonist; Institutes; Intercept; kinase inhibitor; Lead; Legal patent; Link; Measures; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; memory recognition; Metabolic; Microsomes; Microtubule Stabilization; Modeling; Monkeys; mouse model; Mus; Neocortex; neurofibrillary tangle formation; Neurofibrillary Tangles; neuron loss; Neuronal Dysfunction; Neurons; novel; Oral; overexpression; oxidation; Pathogenesis; Pathologic; Penetration; Permeability; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase; Phase II Clinical Trials; Phosphorylation; Phosphotransferases; preclinical development; preclinical study; Preparation; Property; Rattus; Reporting; Risk-Benefit Assessment; Role; Safety; safety study; safety testing; scale up; small molecule; Solubility; Source; Specificity; Structure; Symptoms; Synapses; Synaptic plasticity; tau phosphorylation; tau Proteins; tau-1; Tauopathies; Testing; therapeutic evaluation; Time; Tissues; Toxic effect; Tyrosine; Visual; Work; young adult; ","Development of DYRK1A allosteric modulator for the treatment of Alzheimer?s Disease","056181","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","01","","","582601",""

Identifying asymptomatic at risk individuals during preclinical stages of AD will allow initiation of therapies that will either slo or, preferably, stop the progression of the disease. Research conducted at the Wisconsin ADRC has made seminal contributions to the field of biomarker research for AD, and has the potential to eventually find a cure for AD.

This proposal has relevance for public health as it will test the efficacy of a portable, cost-effective intervention designed to prevent/remediate known late effects of treatment among children with ALL. This intervention will be tested using the infrastructure of the Children's Oncology Group to enroll children across multiple study sites. If successful, it provides a model for not only children treated for ALL, but for other children whose acute disease and necessary treatments have late effects that interfere with future health, function and quality of life.","8385858; ","NESS, KIRSTEN KIMBERLIE;","PERNA, FRANK ","07/01/2016","06/30/2021","Accelerometer; Acute Disease; Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia; adipokines; Adolescent; Adopted; Aftercare; arm; base; Biological Markers; blood pressure reduction; Body mass index; Bone Density; Cardiomyopathies; chemotherapy; Child; Childhood Leukemia; Complement; Computer software; Computers; Control Groups; cost; cost effective; dashboard; Data; design; Diagnosis; Educational Materials; Effectiveness; efficacy testing; Enrollment; Evaluation; experience; Fasting; Fatigue; fitness; Future; Gifts; Glucose; Goals; group intervention; handheld mobile device; Health; Height; improved; Individual; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Insulin; Intervention; intervention effect; Late Effects; learning materials; Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Acute, L1; Lipids; Literature; Measures; Mediating; Modeling; Modification; neuromusculoskeletal; Neuropathy; obesity risk; Online Systems; Only Child; Participant; Pediatric Oncology Group; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases; Physical activity; Physiological; Pilot Projects; Population; portability; prevent; prospective; Protocols documentation; psychosocial; public health relevance; Quality of life; Randomized; Recruitment Activity; Reporting; Research; Research Infrastructure; Resources; Rewards; Sampling; Schools; sedentary; sedentary lifestyle; Site; Survival Rate; Survivors; survivorship; System; Testing; Therapeutic; therapy design; Time; tool; treatment effect; Video Games; Walking; web site; Wireless Technology; ","Web-based Physical Activity Intervention for Children with ALL","193478","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","513749","356156","869905",""

Based on these results, a multicenter Phase 1/2 clinical trial of intravesical ALT-803 + BCG was initiated under the SBIR Phase II project and the dose escalation was successfully completed with a determination of a recommended dose level of ALT-803 that exhibits favorable safety, immunostimulatory properties, and clinical benefit to patients.

Remarkable progress has been made in identifying genetic factors responsible for HRFDs. However, our knowledge about how these genetic defects lead to HRFDs is still limited, hindering the development of effective therapeutic strategies. The mission of the Hepatorenal Fibrocystic Disease Core Center (HRFDCC) is to accelerate the pace of research into the genetic, biochemical, and cellular mechanisms of HRFDs and the subsequent translation of these discoveries into effective treatments. To advance HRFD research, the HRFDCC will integrate the expertise of the Core Directors and the Investigator Base with genetic information from HRFD patients, cost effective methodologies, and access to innovative in vitro and in vivo HRFD biological resources. The Center will complement this integrative model with infrastructure allowing efficient preclinical assessment of lead compounds across multiple HRFD diseases using cell-based and in vivo models.

Our proposed program to build the capacity of junior Ugandan faculty to conduct medical research focusing on health care disparities in rural Uganda will thus have great potential impact both in Uganda and in other SSA settings.

The disorder is characterized by progressive renal cyst formation, which ultimately causes end stage renal disease (ESRD) in a significant proportion of those affected. There is no cure for Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD) and complications are treated as they arise. During the past 5 years several large clinical trials testing therapies for polycystic kidney disease have been reported. Despite a large investment of resources, these therapies have not reversed nor cured the disease. There remains a need for an improved understanding of the PKD signaling nexus in order to identify new therapeutic targets. The next generation of prospective therapeutics will have the highest chance of clinical success if they are informed by basic discovery research. This will require synergy between all corners of the 'PKD Universe', Basic and Clinical investigators alike. The overarching objective of this Center of Excellence is to provide state of the art resources and expertise to a national and international Research Base of investigators with the goal of advancing innovative translational science in the field of Polycystic Kidney Disease. Through expanded interdisciplinary collaborations, we hope to catalyze the translation of biomedical discoveries that will prevent progression of polycystic kidney disease and its consequences.","1868914; ","WATNICK, TERRY J;","MOXEY-MIMS, MARVA M.","09/30/2010","06/30/2020","Address; Affect; Antibodies; Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney; Baltimore; base; Basic Science; bench to bedside; biobank; biomedical referral center; career; cellular engineering; Clinic; Clinical; Clinical Investigator; Clinical Protocols; Clinical Trials; Collaborations; Communities; Cystic kidney; Discipline; Disease; End stage renal failure; Ensure; experience; Funding; Gap Junctions; Genes; Genetic; Genetic study; Goals; improved; Inherited; innovation; interdisciplinary collaboration; International; Investments; Kidney Diseases; Laboratories; Maryland; medical schools; member; Methods; Molecular Genetics; mouse model; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases; new therapeutic target; next generation; Participant; Patient Care; Polycystic Kidney Diseases; prevent; prospective; public health relevance; Reagent; Recruitment Activity; Reporting; repository; Research; Research Personnel; Resources; Science; Services; Signal Transduction; Site; success; synergism; Testing; Therapeutic; tool; Translational Research; Translations; Universities; Validation; ","Baltimore Polycystic Kidney Disease Research and Clinical Core Center","090868","ZDK1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","09","737609","279580","1017189",""

Cerebral aneurysms are prone to rupture, resulting in hemorrhagic stroke, crippling paralysis, or even death. Physicians treat cerebral aneurysms by blocking blood flow to the aneurysmal sac via surgical sealing or filling the sac with radiopaque embolic materials under fluoroscopic guidance from a microcatheter. Current mechanical embolic agents, such as injectable coils, depend upon inducing thrombus to stop blood from accessing the aneurismal sack, leading to increased risk of recanalization and subsequent rupture. Clinically available liquid embolic agents are able to completely fill the aneurysmal sac, but use toxic organic solvents or produce inflammatory by-products that potentially lead to chronic inflammatory disease, vasospasm, and angionecrosis. For this project we will create a liquid embolic agent that fills aneurysms, reinforces the weakened vasculature, and facilitates healing. This proposal utilizes silk-elastinlike protein polymers (SELP) that combine the solubility of mammalian elastin and the strength of silk to create molecules with tunable solubility and mechanical properties. We hypothesize that a non-toxic radiopaque liquid embolic hydrogel will improve the rate of healing and reduce the risk of aneurysm rupture compared to current metal coil or polyvinyl alcohol based embolics.  Building on our expertise in the fields of recombinant polymer design and local drug delivery, we will pursue the following three aims: (1) synthesize and characterize radiopaque SELP formulations to transition from an injectable liquid to a solid hydrogel; (2) evaluate delivery and stability of radiopaque SELP formulation in an in vitro aneurysm model, and (3) analyze performance SELP embolics in vivo in a rabbit aneurysm model.","9813617; 1922792 (contact); ","CHENEY, DARWIN LEROY; GHANDEHARI, HAMID  (contact);","FERTIG, STEPHANIE ","08/15/2017","01/31/2019","Address; Aftercare; Aneurysm; aqueous; Arteriovenous malformation; base; Biocompatible Materials; Biological Response Modifier Therapy; biomaterial compatibility; Blood; Blood flow; Brain hemorrhage; Catheters; Cell Therapy; Cells; Cerebral Aneurysm; cerebral artery; Cerebrovascular system; Cessation of life; Characteristics; Chronic; Clinical; cost; cytotoxicity; design; Development; Development Plans; Disease; Elastases; Elastin; Exposure to; Foreign Bodies; Formulation; Fracture; Functional disorder; Gel; Genetic; Genetic Engineering; healing; hemodynamics; Human; Hydrogels; Hypervascular; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; in vivo Model; Inflammatory; Injectable; Injection of therapeutic agent; insight; Instruction; iodixanol; Label; Lead; Liquid substance; local drug delivery; mechanical properties; Mechanics; Medical; metallicity; Metals; Modeling; Molecular Weight; Monitor; monomer; Neck; Nervous System Trauma; Neurologic Symptoms; next generation; novel; Operative Surgical Procedures; Organic solvent product; Oryctolagus cuniculus; Paralysed; Performance; Peripheral; Pharmacotherapy; Phase; Physicians; Polymers; Polyvinyl Alcohol; Preparation; pressure; prevent; Protein Engineering; Proteins; Recombinant Proteins; Recombinants; Research; response; Risk; risk minimization; Rupture; Ruptured Aneurysm; seal; Silk; Small Business Technology Transfer Research; soft tissue; Solid; Solubility; standard of care; Structure; Symptoms; System; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Embolization; Thrombus; Tissues; Translating; Treatment Protocols; tumor; Vasculitis; Vasospasm; Wages; Work; ","Recombinant Silk Elastin-like Protein Polymers for the Embolization of Cerebral Aneurysms","100184","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","01","","","250000",""

Social vulnerabilities such as housing, food, and economic insecurity, and social isolation, are associated with higher readmission risk but health systems are currently poorly equipped to recognize or address these vulnerabilities. This project focuses on: 1) developing an automated, computerized approach to identifying individuals at high risk for readmission due to social vulnerabilities; 2) understanding patient perceptions on the impact of social vulnerabilities on readmissions and cardiovascular disease, and the acceptability of community-based interventions to address these vulnerabilities; and 3) implementing and evaluating an enhanced evidence-based transitional care strategy for high risk patients that leverages existing community- based resources via a novel social-health information exchange to address social vulnerabilities and improve care for adults with cardiovascular illness.","12153302; ","NGUYEN, OANH KIEU;","WELLS, BARBARA L.","08/18/2017","05/31/2022","Acute myocardial infarction; Address; Adult; Affect; Area; Attention; Award; base; behavioral health; Biometry; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cardiovascular system; care delivery; career development; Caring; Clinical; Communities; community intervention; community organizations; Complication; computerized; Congestive Heart Failure; County; Data; design; Development; Doctor of Philosophy; Economics; Education; Electronic Health Record; Emergency Situation; Evaluation; evidence base; experience; faculty mentor; Food; Funding; Goals; good diet; Health; Health Policy; Health Services Research; Health system; Heart; high risk; Home environment; Hospital Readmission; Hospitalization; Hospitals; Housing; implementation science; improved; Income; Individual; Influentials; Information Technology; innovation; Inpatients; Intervention; Interview; K-Series Research Career Programs; Medical; Mentors; Mentorship; Methods; Modeling; Myocardial Ischemia; novel; Outcome; Outcomes Research; patient oriented; Patient risk; Patient-Focused Outcomes; Patients; Perception; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Policies; predictive modeling; prevent; Prevention strategy; Process; Qualitative Methods; Randomized Controlled Trials; Recovery; Research; research and development; Research Personnel; Resources; Risk; Risk stratification; safety net; Series; Severities; social; social health determinants; Social isolation; Social support; Social Work; success; System; Techniques; therapy development; Training; Transportation; United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality; Visit; World Health; ","Addressing Social Vulnerabilities to Prevent Hospital Readmissions in Adults with Cardiovascular Disease","133441","MPOR","NHLBI Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Review Committee ","","A1","01","175350","14028","189378",""

Recently redefined as a condition of ?life threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection?, sepsis contributed to more than 2.4 millions deaths in the US during 1999- 2014. Currently, there are no approved drugs that specifically treat this devastating disease. While numerous clinical trials with therapies aimed at altering the general host defense against infection have failed to demonstrate mortality benefits, researchers are facing a great deal of challenges arising from an incomplete understanding of the cellular or molecular processes underlying organ malfunction in response to septic insults. We recently discovered that an enzyme, called a disintegrin metalloprotease (ADAM), plays a critical role in mediating tissue injury associated with sepsis. Here, we propose further in-depth analyses of this molecule, focusing on how dysregulation of ADAM leads to structural and functional damage of the vascular endothelium, a cell barrier lining the surface of blood vessel lumen that prevents leakage of blood contents to surrounding tissues. We will also test new drugs and biological interventions targeting ADAM in the vascular endothelium as potential therapies for sepsis.","7957512; ","YUAN, SARAH Y;","SOMERS, SCOTT D.","09/01/2011","04/30/2021","age difference; Albumins; Alpha Cell; Animal Organ; Animals; Attention; Biological; Biological Markers; Blood; Blood Circulation; Blood Coagulation Disorders; Blood Vessels; CD44 gene; Cells; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.); Cessation of life; Characteristics; Cleaved cell; Clinical Trials; clinically relevant; Collaborations; comparative; Critical Illness; Cytoplasmic Tail; Data; design; Development; Diagnosis; Disease; Disintegrins; Edema; endothelial dysfunction; Endothelium; Enzymes; Experimental Models; Exposure to; Extravasation; Family; Family member; Functional disorder; Funding; Glycocalyx; Glycoproteins; Glycosaminoglycans; Grant; Hemorrhage; Host Defense; Human; Hyaluronan; Immune response; in vivo; Infection; Inflammation; Inflammatory; inhibitor/antagonist; Injury; innovation; insight; Intervention; Investigation; Investigational Therapies; Leukocytes; Life; Link; Lung; Mediating; Medical emergency; Membrane; Metalloproteases; MicroRNAs; microscopic imaging; Microvascular Dysfunction; migration; Molecular; Molecular Analysis; Molecular Structure; Molecular Target; mortality; Mus; neutrophil; new therapeutic target; novel; novel therapeutics; Operative Surgical Procedures; Organ; Organ Procurements; outcome forecast; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Peptide Hydrolases; Permeability; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Physiological; Plasma; Play; prevent; Prevention; Preventive; Process; Property; Proteoglycan; Reaction; Reporting; Research Personnel; respiratory distress syndrome; response; Role; Sepsis; septic; Series; Sex Characteristics; Signal Transduction; Snake Venoms; Stress; Structure; Surface; Symptoms; syndecan; targeted treatment; Techniques; Testing; Therapeutic; therapeutic evaluation; Tissues; Trauma; Up-Regulation; Vascular Endothelium; vascular inflammation; Work; ","Disintegrin Metalloprotease and Endothelial Dysfunction in Sepsis","097270","SAT","Surgery, Anesthesiology and Trauma Study Section ","","","06","190000","94050","284050",""

The predominant reason is that HIV-infected persons are living longer as a result of access to antiretroviral treatment (ART), resulting in greatly improved survival rates. In sub- Saharan Africa, where HIV prevalence rates in the general population are still very high, this will become a major public health issue. Understanding the impacts of HIV/AIDS in older adults, and factors that influence this over time, will be key to maintaining health and minimizing health care costs in this population as it ages. The WHO Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE) - Well-being in Older Persons Study (WOPS) on HIV/AIDS, will provide needed data in two highly impacted countries, but which have different timing of implementation and levels of political support behind their approaches to deal with the epidemic. Insights obtained from such studies will help plan health care and social policy to provide the appropriate support required to support these populations and protect their productive roles in communities such as caregivers. These studies would also help to improve our understanding of the interrelationship between aging, non-communicable diseases, HIV/AIDS and ART. Important strategies to extend health care for HIV/AIDS and chronic diseases in an integrated manner can be identified to promote well-being and improve quality of life. Data collected as part of the proposed study have also been designed to be comparable to ageing and health studies in higher income countries.","9198217; ","CHATTERJI, SOMNATH ;","PATMIOS, GEORGEANNE E.","09/01/2014","05/31/2019","Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Address; Adult; Affect; Africa; Africa South of the Sahara; African; Age; age group; aged; Aging; Aging-Related Process; AIDS/HIV problem; Anti-Retroviral Agents; antiretroviral therapy; Archives; Area; Arthritis; base; Biological; Biological Markers; C-reactive protein; Caregivers; caregiving; Cell Aging; Characteristics; Child; Chronic Disease; cohort; Communities; community setting; Complex; Country; Cytomegalovirus; Cytomegalovirus Infections; Data; Data Collection; design; Diabetes Mellitus; Elderly; Employee Strikes; Epidemic; Epidemiology; Excision; Family; Family Study; frailty; Funding; General Population; Geography; Grant; Health; Health Care Costs; Health Planning; Health Services Accessibility; Health Status; Healthcare; High Prevalence; high risk; HIV; HIV antiretroviral; HIV Seropositivity; Household; Human immunodeficiency virus test; Hypertension; Immune; immune function; Immunologic Markers; Impaired cognition; improved; Incidence; Income; Individual; Inflammation; insight; Interleukin-6; International; Interview; Lead; Length; Longitudinal cohort study; Longitudinal Studies; Low income; Measures; Medical Research; member; Mental Depression; Metadata; Minority; Modeling; mortality; multiple chronic conditions; Nature; NIH Office of AIDS Research; older women; Orphan; Outcome; Participant; peri-urban; Personal Satisfaction; Persons; Play; Politics; Population; Prevalence; Public Health; public health relevance; Quality of life; Research; Research Personnel; Respondent; Retirement; Risk Behaviors; Risk Factors; Role; Rural; Sampling; senescence; sex; Site; Social Network; Social Policies; Societies; socioeconomics; South Africa; Surveys; Survival Rate; T-Cell Receptor; telomere; Time; TNF gene; treatment program; Uganda; virtual; Woman; Work; working group; World Health Organization; ","Direct and indirect impacts of HIV and ART among older people in community settin","044917","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","04","406695","18567","425262",""

Since ALK inhibitors are approved by the FDA, these studies could potentially lead to repurposing of these compounds for alcohol use disorders.","10755970; ","LASEK, AMY WOLVEN;","CHIN, HEMIN R","09/05/2011","01/31/2022","Achievement; Alcohol abuse; alcohol abuse therapy; Alcohol consumption; Alcohol dependence; alcohol exposure; alcohol response; alcohol testing; alcohol use disorder; Alcoholism; Alcohols; Amygdaloid structure; anaplastic lymphoma kinase; Animals; Antibodies; Astrocytes; Attenuated; Biological Response Modifiers; Brain; Brain region; Candidate Disease Gene; CCL2 gene; Cell Nucleus; cell type; Cells; chemokine; Chronic; Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats; Collaborations; Complementary DNA; cytokine; Data; Development; Dose; drinking; Electrophysiology (science); Ethanol; Ethanol dependence; experimental study; Extracellular Signal Regulated Kinases; FDA approved; gamma-Aminobutyric Acid; Gene Delivery; Gene Expression; gene function; Genes; Genetic Models; Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein; Goals; Heavy Drinking; I Kappa B-Alpha; Immune; Immune response; Immune signaling; Immunohistochemistry; Immunologic Factors; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Infusion procedures; inhibitor/antagonist; interest; kinase inhibitor; knock-down; Knock-out; knockout gene; Laboratories; Lead; Lentivirus Vector; Ligands; MAPK3 gene; Measures; Mediating; Methods; Microglia; midkine; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Mus; neural circuit; Neural Pathways; Neuraxis; Neuroimmune; Neuroimmunomodulation; Neurosciences; neurotransmission; new technology; novel; Nuclear; overexpression; Pathway interactions; Phosphorylation; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Process; protein function; Proteins; PTGS2 gene; Rattus; Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases; Recombinants; Research Personnel; Resources; response; RNA Interference; Role; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Signaling Protein; small hairpin RNA; small molecule; small molecule inhibitor; Stat3 protein; Stress; Subfamily lentivirinae; System; Testing; therapeutic target; Time; tool; transcription factor; transgene expression; transmission process; Validation; vector; Ventral Tegmental Area; Viral; Viral Vector; Western Blotting; Work; ","5/13 ALK and Midkine as Novel Neuroimmune Regulators of Alcohol Consumption","020912","ZAA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","07","219375","131406","350781",""

Since 2008, we have made multidisciplinary efforts for this important medical question. Based on our published works, promising preliminary results, and refined experimental strategies, we now conceptualize a new collaborative, hypothesis-driven research strategy towards a mechanistic understanding of SZ and related conditions. We will focus on aberrant maturation of prefrontal cortex during adolescence by combining unique human tissue/RNA-sequencing data resources with mouse studies. Through the proposed study, we hope to make meaningful discoveries that will inform molecular targets and appropriate timing for early detection and intervention for SZ. In particular, we hope to address a specific, treatment-resistant subset of SZ with prominent negative and cognitive symptoms, in which neurodevelopmental implications may be stronger. Finally, by studying the circuitry and behavioral mechanisms underlying specific cognitive dimensions in SZ, we hope to contribute towards studies and treatment of young adult-onset mental disorders with neurodevelopmental origins beyond SZ.","7032421; ","SAWA, AKIRA ;","ZALCMAN, STEVEN J.","07/12/2011","06/30/2021","Address; Adolescence; Adolescent; Adult; Affect; Animal Behavior; Animal Model; Area; base; Behavior; Behavioral; Behavioral Mechanisms; Bioinformatics; Biological; Biometry; Brain; Cell model; Cells; Clinical; Cognitive; Collaborations; critical period; Data; data resource; Databases; defined contribution; Development; Dimensions; Disease; Early Diagnosis; Early Intervention; Electrophysiology (science); Functional disorder; Future; gene environment interaction; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Risk; Histologic; Human; Human Genetics; human tissue; Impaired cognition; Impairment; Individual; innovation; Intervention; Lead; Medical; Memory impairment; Mental disorders; Methods; Microtubule-Associated Proteins; Microtubules; Molecular; Molecular Profiling; Molecular Target; mouse model; multidisciplinary; Mus; neural circuit; Neurobehavioral Manifestations; Neurons; Onset of illness; Outcome; Pathologic; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pattern; Pre-Clinical Model; Prefrontal Cortex; Prospective cohort; Psychiatrist; psychosocial; Puberty; public health relevance; Publishing; Refractory; relating to nervous system; Research; Resistance; Resources; Risk; RNA analysis; Role; Sampling; Schizophrenia; Short-Term Memory; Social isolation; social stress; Societies; Solid; Stress; stressor; Symptoms; transcriptome sequencing; treatment strategy; Work; young adult; ","Gene-Environment Interactions for Cortical Development and Schizophrenia","094268","ZMH1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","07","1373720","575175","1948895",""

Most patients complain of spontaneous, ongoing pain, as well as an increased sensation to both painful and normally non-painful stimuli. Available treatments produce either incomplete and temporary pain relief, or adverse side effects. Understanding the mechanisms that contribute to neuropathic pain is important for the development of new and effective therapeutic strategies. This is the focus of this proposal. The project described in this proposal is based on exciting new findings, showing that the parabrachial nucleus, a relatively unknown center of pain processing, plays a critical role in the development of chronic pain. We will test the hypothesis that chronic, neuropathic pain results from abnormally amplified activity of the parabrachial nucleus, due to reduce inhibition from the amygdala, a key nucleus for processing emotions. Findings from this research project will provide insights on how nerve injury results in neuropathic pain. This will allow for the development of novel treatments to prevent and manage the debilitating consequences of nerve injury.","1868856 (contact); 9628473; ","KELLER, ASAF  (contact); MASRI, RADI ;","OSHINSKY, MICHAEL L","08/15/2017","05/31/2022","Adverse effects; Affect; American; Amygdaloid structure; animal pain; Animals; awake; base; Behavioral; Brain; Cell Nucleus; Chronic; chronic constriction injury; chronic neuropathic pain; chronic pain; Complex; constriction; cost; Data; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; Electrophysiology (science); Emotions; Esthesia; Feedback; Functional disorder; gamma-Aminobutyric Acid; Glutamate Decarboxylase; Goals; Gray unit of radiation dose; Heart Diseases; In Vitro; in vivo; insight; Intractable Pain; Lead; Malignant Neoplasms; Medical; Modeling; Nerve; nerve injury; Nerve Pain; neuronal circuitry; Neurons; Nociception; novel; novel therapeutics; Nuclear; Operative Surgical Procedures; optogenetics; Pain; Pain Clinics; pain symptom; painful neuropathy; Painless; parabrachial nucleus; patch clamp; Pathologic; Pathway interactions; Patients; Peripheral nerve injury; Pharmacogenetics; Pharmacologic Substance; Pharmacology; Play; Pontine structure; postsynaptic; prevent; Productivity; programs; Proteins; Regulation; relating to nervous system; Research; Research Project Grants; Resistance; Rodent; Role; Serotonin; Slice; Spinal Cord; Stimulus; Structure; synthetic enzyme; System; Testing; Treatment Efficacy; ","Parabrachial role in chronic pain","099245","SCS","Somatosensory and Chemosensory Systems Study Section ","","A1","01","218750","119219","337969",""

First, the method is completely non-invasive so the risk of infection and effects caused by normal brain penetration are removed. Second, the method can deliver large therapeutic molecules into an image targeted location in the brain.

Moreover, several risk factors for childhood asthma suggest that childhood may begin already in utero, and the maternal milieu during pregnancy may contribute to disease risk.  Our preliminary data suggest that mechanisms rooted in the environmental microbiome, the maternal immune milieu, the child's immune epigenome at birth and early-life microbiota play a prominent role in this trajectory. We hypothesize that the pregnant mother's immune profile, influenced by environmental exposures, modifies the child's epigenome in utero, postnatal airway microbiome development, and the trajectory to allergy and asthma during childhood. To test this hypothesis, we will characterize (a) the child's immune methylome at birth and its relationships with the prenatal maternal immune milieu, respiratory microbiota development, and asthma and allergic disease outcomes from birth to age 9 yrs; and (b) environmental microbial exposures and post-natal (<1 year old) respiratory microbiota and their relationship with maternal immune profile, neonatal epigenome, and child's risk for asthma, allergy and related outcomes from birth to age 9 yrs. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a single study examines all of these characteristics and their mutual relations in the context of childhood asthma and allergy.","8900843; 6519116 (contact); ","LYNCH, SUSAN VERONICA; VERCELLI, DONATA  (contact);","DONG, GANG ","08/15/2017","07/31/2019","1 year old; Address; Age; AIDS/HIV problem; Allergic; Allergic Disease; Antibiotics; Asthma; asthmatic; base; Biological Assay; Birth; Cells; Characteristics; Child; Childhood; Childhood Asthma; Chronic Disease; Chronology; cohort; Communities; Consumption; Cues; Data; Development; Disease; Disease Outcome; disorder risk; DNA Methylation; Economic Burden; emerging adult; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Tobacco Smoke; Epidemiology; epigenome; Event; Exhibits; Exposure to; Farming environment; Fever; flu; FOXP3 gene; Genetic; gut microbiota; House Dust; Hypermethylation; Hypersensitivity; IgE; IL2RA gene; IL4 gene; Immune; Immunity; in utero; Infant; Infection; inner city; Interferons; Interleukin-13; Knowledge; Lead; Life; Lipids; MADH3 gene; Maternal Exposure; Mediterranean Diet; Meta-Analysis; Metabolism; methylome; Microbe; microbial; microbial community; microbiome; microbiota; Mitogens; Mothers; Nature; Neonatal; neonate; novel; Nursery Schools; offspring; Outcome; Pathway interactions; Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell; persistent symptom; Plant Roots; Play; postnatal; Predisposition; Pregnancy; pregnant; prenatal; prenatal exposure; promoter; Recording of previous events; Relative Risks; respiratory; response; Risk; Risk Factors; Role; Sampling; Smoking; Stress; Structure; study population; Taxonomy; Testing; Third Pregnancy Trimester; Time; Tuberculosis; Umbilical Cord Blood; Water; Weight; Wheezing; ","Interactions between Environmental Microbiome, Maternal Immunity, Neonatal Epigenome and Respiratory Microbiome Development as Determinants of Asthma In Childhood","133765","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","186030","57633","243663",""

We propose a series of studies leveraging diverse expertise in immunology, bacterial pathogenesis and biomedical engineering to define, for the first time, critical elements of host-microbial interactions within the fetal membranes that will help explain how CAM occurs and shed light on actionable targets for both host- and microbe-based interventions to prevent or treat CAM and improve pregnancy outcome.","6665047; ","ARONOFF, DAVID M;","PRABHUDAS, MERCY R.","08/18/2017","07/31/2022","adverse outcome; amnion; Antibiotics; Bacteria; Bacterial Genes; Bacterial Infections; Bacterial Model; base; Biomedical Engineering; Data; defense response; Development; Diagnosis; disability; Disease; Elements; Epithelial Cells; Equilibrium; fascinate; fetal; Fetal Membranes; Fetus; Genes; Genotype; Glean; Gravid; Gravidity; healthy pregnancy; Host Defense; host-microbe interactions; Human; Immune; Immune Evasion; Immune Tolerance; Immunology; improved; in vivo; Infection; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Inflammatory Response; instrument; Intervention; intraamniotic infection; Invaded; Knowledge; Light; macrophage; Maternal-Fetal Exchange; Membrane; Metalloproteases; Microbe; microbial; Microfluidics; Modeling; Molecular; Morbidity - disease rate; Mothers; mouse model; Mutagenesis; Mutation; NADH peroxidase; Natural History; Natural Immunity; neonatal sepsis; novel diagnostics; Oxidative Stress; paracrine; pathogen; Pathogenesis; Placentation; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; premature; Premature Birth; Premature Labor; prevent; Prevention therapy; Problem Solving; Process; prognostic; Reproductive Immunology; response; Role; Rupture; Series; Shapes; Streptococcal Infections; Streptococcus; Streptococcus Group B; Stromal Cells; Structure; Syndrome; Techniques; Testing; Therapeutic Intervention; Time; Tissues; tool; transcriptome sequencing; trophoblast; Uterus; Vagina; Variant; ","The Role of macrophages in chorioamnionitis and group B streptococcal infections","134036","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","349005","146458","495463",""

This viral infection has emerged as a threat to public health and the blood supply, yet no FDA-cleared, accurate and well-validated commercial tests for Zika are currently available. The need is further exacerbated by the difficulty in distinguishing Zika from Dengue virus infection given that the two viruses are genetically related, and overlap in mosquito vector and regions of endemicity. In Phase I, we propose to identify peptide epitopes specific for the Zika virus that will enable development of an ELISA test allowing accurate serologic identification of Zika infection in individuals who may also have had exposure to Dengue virus. In Phase II we will refine this assay into a manufactured product, carry out a clinical study to support a 510(k) submission to FDA, and achieve clearance of the Zika ELISA for in vitro diagnosis of infected individuals and management and counseling of blood donors.","7895207; ","LEVIN, ANDREW E.;","CHALLBERG, MARK D.","08/18/2017","07/31/2019","Acute; Address; Aedes; Affect; Africa; Antibodies; Antigens; Area; Asians; assay development; Autoimmune Process; Awareness; base; Benign; Binding; Biological Assay; Birth; Bite; Blood; Blood Donations; Blood donor; Blood Screening; Blood Transfusion; Brazil; Caribbean region; Cell Culture Techniques; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.); Central America; Characteristics; Clinical; clinical Diagnosis; clinical diagnostics; Clinical Research; Counseling; cross reactivity; Culicidae; Dengue; Dengue Infection; Dengue Virus; Detection; Development; Diagnosis; diagnostic assay; Disease Outbreaks; Emergency Situation; Ensure; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Epitopes; Evaluation; Event; Exposure to; Family; Female; Flaviviridae; Flavivirus; gene product; Generations; Genes; Geography; Glass; Gold; Grant; Guillain-Barre Syndrome; Health; Human; Immunoassay; Immunodominant Epitopes; Immunoglobulin G; Immunoglobulin M; Immunology procedure; immunoreactivity; In Vitro; Individual; Infant; Infection; International; Investigation; Laboratories; Link; Longitudinal Surveys; Membrane Proteins; Meningitis; Mexico; Microcephaly; Neutralization Tests; Newborn Infant; North America; Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests; Nucleic Acids; Peptides; Performance; Phase; Population; protein aminoacid sequence; Proteins; prototype; Public Health; public health emergency; Puerto Rico; Ramp; Reporting; Research Institute; Risk; RNA; Safety; Sampling; Sequence Homology; Serologic tests; Serological; seropositive; Serotyping; Serum; Slide; South America; systems research; Techniques; Testing; Tigers; Time; Transfusion; Translating; transmission process; Travel; United States; United States Food and Drug Administration; Validation; Vascular blood supply; vector mosquito; Viral; viral detection; Viral Genes; viral RNA; Viremia; Virus; Virus Diseases; virus envelope; West Nile virus; Woman; World Health Organization; Zika Virus; ","Serologic assays for detection of Zika virus antibodies for clinical diagnosis and blood donor counseling","134502","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","","","299621",""

Traditional psychiatric measurement fixes the number of items and allows measurement precision to vary from subject to subject. In CAT, the numbers of items and the specific items that are administered are allowed to vary across individuals, but the precision of measurement is fixed. When leveraging a large bank of items, CAT dynamically selects a small and optimal set of items for each individual until a high and predefined level of measurement precision is achieved. This paradigm shift in measurement will impact public health in that it can achieve both substantially increased measurement precision and greatly decreased assessment times, making routine screening and measurement of youth mental health disorders feasible in both mental and physical health settings.","1955069; ","GIBBONS, ROBERT D;","GARVEY, MARJORIE A","08/15/2017","04/30/2018","acronyms; Address; Adolescence; Adolescent; Adult; Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; base; Behavior; Bipolar Disorder; Categories; Child; Childhood; Comorbidity; computerized; Conduct Disorder; Data; depressive symptoms; Development; Diagnosis; Diagnostic; Diagnostics Research; Dimensions; Disease; Disruptive Behavior Disorder; Educational Measurement; Equipment and supply inventories; functional disability; Generalized Anxiety Disorder; Goals; improved; Individual; informant; instrument; Interview; Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender; Major Depressive Disorder; Manic; Measurement; Measures; Mental Depression; Mental disorders; Mental Health; Mental Tests; Methodology; Modeling; Monitor; Negative Valence; Oppositional Defiant Disorder; Outpatients; Parents; Phase; physical conditioning; Population; Positive Valence; primary caregiver; Primary Health Care; Probability; Process; Psychiatric therapeutic procedure; Psychometrics; Psychopathology; Public Health; public health relevance; Research; Research Domain Criteria; response; Sampling; screening; Separation Anxiety Disorder; Severities; Social Phobia; Specific Phobia; Specificity; success; Suicide; Symptoms; Techniques; Testing; theories; Time; Work; young adult; Youth; ","Computerized Adaptive Testing of Suicidality in LGBT Young Adults","100155","CPDD","Child Psychopathology and Developmental Disabilities Study Section ","","S1","05","71228","28663","99891",""

Understanding how the brain normally processes information is a central unsolved problem in neuroscience. The approach we propose, once developed and validated through the proposed work, could have wide applicability in understanding not only how normal brain circuits function but also circuits in experimental models of disease. Our method is non-invasive as it only entails optical imaging once fluorescent indicators are loaded into neurons. The latter step can be easily performed genetically, enabling entirely non-invasive imaging across a wide variety of disease model systems. Understanding how brain (especially cortical) circuits function is likely to lead to new insights into new, innovative therapeutic approaches to major neurological diseases, especially those that involve cognitive impairments such as neurodegenerative disorders, epilepsy and neurodevelopmental disorders.","1862599; ","STROWBRIDGE, BEN W;","STEWART, RANDALL R","08/15/2017","07/31/2019","Acute; Animals; Area; base; Behavior; Biological Assay; Biological Models; Biological Neural Networks; Brain; Brain region; brain tissue; calcium indicator; Cells; Computer Simulation; dentate gyrus; Detection; detector; Disease model; Dyes; Electrodes; Epilepsy; Experimental Models; experimental study; extracellular; Goals; Hilar; Image; Imaging Techniques; Impaired cognition; in vivo; in vivo imaging; Individual; innovation; insight; Label; Lead; Light; light transmission; Masks; Methodology; Methods; Microscope; Monitor; Morphologic artifacts; Motion; multi-electrode arrays; nervous system disorder; Neurodegenerative Disorders; Neurodevelopmental Disorder; Neurons; Neurosciences; Noise; non-invasive imaging; optical imaging; Optical Methods; Optics; Output; patch clamp; Pathway interactions; Pattern; Perforant Pathway; Performance; Phase; Photometry; Photons; Population; Process; prototype; public health relevance; Publications; Resolution; response; Rodent; Sampling; Series; Signal Transduction; simulation; Site; Slice; Source; Stimulus; System; Techniques; Testing; Therapeutic; two-photon; Work; ","Decoding network activity states using sparse optical sampling","103182","NOIT","Neuroscience and Ophthalmic Imaging Technologies Study Section ","","A1","01","175000","105000","280000",""

Although plaque can be visualized with ultrasound, CT scans and MRI, none of these tests can distinguish between plaque that is stable and can be treated with medications and plaque that is unstable and may therefore cause a stroke. Therefore, all patients with a large plaque are sent for surgery or for stenting of the carotid artery even though some of them may not necessarily need the procedure. We have been able to create a new chemical with the ability to bind to cells that are more commonly present in unstable plaque. The binding of this chemical to carotid artery plaque can be detected by a noninvasive PET scan. The objective of this research proposal is to demonstrate that binding of this chemical to plaque can pinpoint those patients who may be at high risk for a stroke. The ultimate goal is to provide a tool that can predict which patients have an increased risk of stroke to aid the physician in determining the best treatment approach.","8627197; ","TAMARAPPOO, BALAJI K;","DANTHI, NARASIMHAN ","09/15/2016","07/31/2018","","Detection of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque with a novel 18F-labeled Integrin targeted PET imaging agent","131871","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","283668","212750","496418",""

Project Narrative The combined use of tobacco and cannabis through blunts is a serious public health problem among African American youth due to the increased risk of acquiring smoking-related diseases, and for developing a lifelong addiction to both of these substances. Thus, there is an urgent need for effective treatments to address cannabis and tobacco co-use, especially through the use of blunts (hollowed-out tobacco cigar shells that are filled with cannabis), among African American young adults. This project involves the development and evaluation of a low-cost, fully automated and accessible internet-based social media (i.e., Twitter) treatment intervention to help reduce blunt use among young African American adults, which will have a significant public health impact for an understudied and underserved population.","11590590; ","MONTGOMERY, LATRICE ;","AKLIN, WILL ","08/15/2017","07/31/2022","addiction; Address; Adult; Affinity; African American; Alcohol or Other Drugs use; Area; Attitude; Award; base; Cannabis; Carbon Monoxide; cardiovascular disorder risk; career; career development; Cigar; Clinical Trials; Collaborations; compare effectiveness; cost; cost effective; Data; Data Analyses; design; Development; digital; Disease; disorder risk; Drug usage; Education; effective therapy; Enrollment; Evaluation; experience; Funding; Future; General Population; Goals; Health; Health Technology; improved; Individual; innovation; Internet; Intervention; Interview; Joints; Literature; Lung diseases; marijuana use; Media Intervention; Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award; Mentorship; Methodology; Methods; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Participant; Pattern; peer; Population; Positioning Attribute; preference; primary outcome; Privatization; psychosocial; Public Health; Randomized Clinical Trials; Readiness; Reporting; Research; research and development; Research Methodology; Research Personnel; Research Training; Risk; secondary outcome; Self Efficacy; Site; skills; Smoke; Smoker; Smoking; smoking cessation; Smoking Cessation Intervention; social media; Structure; substance abuse treatment; Surveys; symposium; Testing; therapy development; Tobacco; Tobacco use; Training; Underserved Population; United States National Institutes of Health; Vulnerable Populations; web site; Work; young adult; Youth; ","Twitter-Based Intervention for Young Adult African American Blunt Smokers","042130","IPTA","Interventions to Prevent and Treat Addictions Study Section ","","A1","01","136139","10651","146790",""

The availability of our device will also allow detection of events in other significant conditions where cortical spreading depression has been hypothesized, but which cannot currently be tested non-invasively.

We propose a pre-clinical study in rodent animal models of type 2 diabetes (T2D) characterized by obesity and insulin resistance, to determine if the orally-administered CXCR2 chemokine receptor inhibitor AZD5069 (Astra Zeneca) can: i) improve insulin sensitivity, glucose and insulin tolerance in pre-diabetic mice concurrent with prevention or delay in onset of hyperglycemia; ii) improve and stabilise insulin sensitivity in diabetic recipients; and iiii) preserve and stabilise beta cell function in diabetic recipients. In addition, a series of mechanistic studies are proposed to further decipher the effects of CXCR2 inhibition on the regulation of neutrophil and macrophage populations in mainly the adipose tissues of the rodent study population.

This study proposes to pioneer the study of ECVs in aging and Alzheimer?s disease using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, one of the most widely utilized model organisms, and compare these results with human AD patient samples. These studies will provide key insights into the composition of ECVs from both nematodes and AD patients, providing a new paradigm for developing therapeutics that extend healthy lifespans and treat Alzheimer?s disease.","12650247; ","RUSSELL, JOSHUA ;","YANG, AUSTIN JYAN-YU","08/16/2016","08/15/2019","Adult; Age; age effect; age related; Aging; Alpha Cell; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's disease model; Animal Model; Animals; Biology of Aging; Caenorhabditis elegans; Cells; Cellular biology; cellular transduction; Cerebrospinal Fluid; Communities; comparative; Comparative Study; Disease; Distant; experimental study; Extracellular Space; extracellular vesicles; Fellowship; Generations; Genetic; Genetic Materials; Genetic Models; Goals; Harvest; Human; IL2 gene; In Situ Hybridization; insight; interest; Lipids; Liquid substance; Longevity; macromolecule; migration; Modality; Modeling; mutant; Nematoda; Neurodegenerative Disorders; Neurons; Normal Cell; Organism; Pathogenicity; Pathologic; Patients; Peptide Transport; Peptides; Phenotype; Physiological; Physiology; Play; Population; Preparation; Process; promoter; Proteins; proteotoxicity; Research; Resources; Role; Sampling; Shock; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Stress; Study models; System; Testing; Therapeutic; tool; Transgenic Organisms; Ventricular; Vesicle; ","Role of extracellular vesicle signaling in aging and Alzheimer's disease","054098","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","59166","","59166",""

With an increased pediatric population in South Dakota particularly in low income, rural communities, access to pediatric healthcare has become a major concern. The major pediatric health concerns in this region mirror many other parts of the country, including infant mortality, fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, childhood obesity, type II diabetes, teen pregnancy and suicide. However, many of these pediatric health conditions are higher in SD and this difference is particular prominent for American Indian children and adolescents. The Developmental Research Program for Medical Students at the Sanford School of Medicine at the University of South Dakota will provide research training in pediatric areas to medical students.

Steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) is a rare disease that constitutes the second most frequent cause of ESKD in children and young adults. No curative treatment is available. We recently demonstrated that a single-gene cause of SRNS can be detected in ~30% of all cases with far reaching consequences for diagnostics, prognosis, and the development of treatment. Of the 50 known single-gene causes of SRNS, 34 have been discovered by whole exome sequencing (WES) and studied in the PI's laboratory. The finding that the encoded proteins cluster in well- defined protein interaction complexes has provided fundamental insights into disease mechanisms of SRNS in children and young adults. We have ascertained DNA samples and clinical data from over 4,000 families with SRNS world-wide and have clarified the molecular cause of SRNS in ~25% of cases. We here propose to: SA1. Discover the missing single-gene causes of SRNS by WES in ~1,000 SRNS families. SA2. Functionally characterize newly identified single-gene causes of SRNS/SSNS to delineate the  pathogenesis and study `personalized' genotype-phenotype and genotype-treatment correlations. SA3. Perform small molecule screens in CRISPR k.o. models of novel SRNS genes identified, using estab-  lished `podocyte migration assay' and zebrafish models, to discover the first drugs for SRNS. SA4. Study the 6 novel single-gene causes that we discovered in steroid-dependent NS to converge on RhoA  regulation delineate mechanisms of steroid and other direct drug effects on podocytes.","7334807; ","HILDEBRANDT, FRIEDHELM ;","RASOOLY, REBEKAH S","07/01/2007","06/30/2022","Alleles; Child; Chronic Kidney Failure; Clinical Data; Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats; Coenzyme Q10; cohort; Complex; CRISPR/Cas technology; curative treatments; Diagnostic; Disease; Disease Pathway; DLEC1 gene; DNA; drug discovery; Etiology; exome sequencing; Family; Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis; Funding; gene discovery; Gene Mutation; Genes; Genetic; genetic approach; Genotype; Health; Human; insight; Kidney; Kidney Transplantation; knock-down; Knock-in; Knock-out; Laboratories; Migration Assay; Modeling; Molecular; mouse model; Mus; Mutate; Mutation; Nephrosis; Nephrotic Syndrome; novel; NPHS2 protein; outcome forecast; overexpression; Pathogenesis; Pathogenicity; Pathway interactions; Patients; Penetrance; personalized management; personalized medicine; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phenotype; Physiological; podocyte; precision medicine; Prevalence; protein complex; Proteins; Rare Diseases; Recurrence; Regulation; Risk; Sampling; Signal Transduction; small molecule; Steroid-resistant idiopathic nephrotic syndrome; Steroids; therapy development; young adult; Zebrafish; ","Discover and functionally characterize full-penetrance causes of nephrosis / FSGS","076683","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","12","225000","173250","398250",""

However, brain surgery for epilepsy is only successful in around 50% of the cases. This project explores the idea that the inflammatory response that normally occurs in the brain after any brain surgery is abnormal in certain genetically predisposed individuals, disrupting the healing of the remaining brain and facilitating seizure recurrence. To find evidence of this abnormal neuroinflammatory response in patients with recurrent seizures after surgery, we will perform genetic studies on resected brain tissue from patients who had epilepsy surgery at the Cleveland Clinic, and analyze brain MRI pictures obtained acutely (within 24-72 hours) after epilepsy surgery at the University of Campinas, Brazil. In addition, we will enroll 30 patients undergoing epilepsy surgery at Mayo Clinic or Cleveland Clinic and study their resected brain tissue in more detail while investigating the timeline through which this abnormal neuroinflammation manifests itself in blood tests, brain wave recordings, and MRI pictures of the brain. We hope that this project will help us better understand seizure outcomes after epilepsy surgery and possibly find new ways to improve those outcomes.","10787842; ","JEHI, LARA ;","STEWART, RANDALL R","08/15/2017","07/31/2019","3-Dimensional; Acute; Adult; Beds; Binding; Biological Markers; Blood - brain barrier anatomy; Blood Tests; Brain; brain surgery; brain tissue; Brazil; Chronic; Clinic; clinical care; Collaborations; Collection; Data; Development; differential expression; Electroencephalography; Electron Microscopy; Electrophysiology (science); Enrollment; Ensure; Epilepsy; Epileptogenesis; Excision; Family; Foundations; Freedom; Freezing; Future; Gelatinase B; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genetic study; genetic variant; Genetic Variation; Grant; healing; Hour; Human; IL8 gene; improved; Individual; Inflammasome; Inflammatory Response; innovation; Interleukin-1; Interleukin-1 beta; Interleukin-1 Receptors; Interleukin-18; Lead; Lesion; Levetiracetam; Link; Lobe; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; marenostrin; Measurement; Measures; Mediating; Medical; Microglia; Multiprotein Complexes; Mus; neuroimaging; neuroinflammation; Neurons; Nucleotides; Operative Surgical Procedures; Outcome; Patients; Pattern; Perioperative; Postoperative Period; Predictive Value; Presynaptic Terminals; primary outcome; Prospective cohort; Proteins; receptor; Recurrence; Research; Research Infrastructure; Research Personnel; Resected; Resources; response; Retrospective cohort; Risk; RNA; Role; secondary outcome; Seizures; Serum; Signal Transduction; Single Nucleotide Polymorphism; Site; Stimulus; Temporal Lobe Epilepsy; Testing; Time; time use; TimeLine; Tissues; tool; transcriptome sequencing; Translating; Universities; Work; ","Abnormal Interleukin 1-B Inflammasome Activation and Epilpesy Surgery Outcomes","099734","ANIE","Acute Neural Injury and Epilepsy Study Section ","","A1","01","184875","88936","273811",""

Lysine acetylation is regulated, in part, by a group of enzymes known as histone deacetylases (HDACs) that remove acetyl groups from lysine residues. Misregulated lysine acetylation is associated with multiple human disorders; particularly cancer and HDACs are a validated cancer drug target as four HDAC inhibitors are FDA approved for use in certain cancers. Using a combination of in vitro biochemical and enzyme assays, and X-ray crystallography, I will study the mechanisms of substrate recognition and inhibition of two very poorly characterized members of the HDAC family (i.e. HDACs 10 and 11).

Complete loss of Sox2 from the foregut endoderm of mouse embryos results in esophageal agenesis, however Sox2 is also expressed during development of the enteric nervous system (ENS) of the esophagus. Given that patients with EA can have motility defects, we hypothesize some EA-associated genes may affect ENS development. However, a study of how EA-associated mutations differentially affect the epithelium and/or ENS of the esophagus has never been done in any species, let alone humans. We propose several novel Pluripotent Stem Cell-based approaches to study how SOX2 and other EA-associated genes impact Human esophagus specification, epithelialmorphogenesis,andfunctionalinnervation.","1924383; ","WELLS, JAMES M;","","","","Achalasia; Affect; Autologous; base; beta catenin; Biochemical; Biological Assay; Cell Line; cell motility; cell type; ChIP-seq; Collaborations; Colon; Complex; Congenital Abnormality; constriction; Defect; Development; Disease; Dominant-Negative Mutation; Dorsal; Embryo; embryo tissue; Endoderm; Enteric Nervous System; Eosinophilic Esophagitis; Epithelial; Epithelium; Esophageal; Esophageal Atresia; Esophageal Tissue; Esophagus; Failure; Fetal Tissues; Food; Gastroesophageal reflux disease; Genes; Genetic Transcription; Germ Layers; HMG Domain; HMG-Box; Human; Human Characteristics; human tissue; Impairment; induced pluripotent stem cell; Lead; loss of function; Malignant neoplasm of esophagus; Megaesophagus; Modeling; Molecular; molecular modeling; Molecular Models; Morphogenesis; Morphology; motility disorder; Movement; Mus; Muscle; Mutation; nerve supply; novel; Operative Surgical Procedures; Oral cavity; Organoids; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Patients; Physiological; Pluripotent Stem Cells; Primitive foregut structure; Process; protein B; protein protein interaction; reconstruction; Regulator Genes; Reporter; Resort; respiratory; Respiratory System; Respiratory tract structure; Role; segregation; Signal Transduction; Smooth Muscle; Stomach; Stratified Epithelium; Surgeon; Systems Development; Tissue Engineering; tissue reconstruction; Tissues; Trachea; Tracheoesophageal Fistula; transcription factor; Transcriptional Activation; transcriptome sequencing; Tube; vertebrate embryos; ","Modeling esophageal/respiratory birth defects in human pluripotent  stem cell (PSC)-derived fetal tissues","093363","ZHD1","Special Emphasis Panel ","6211","","01","210407","117828","","328235"

The majority of homeless smokers also abuse alcohol and other drugs, which makes quitting more difficult and magnifies the health consequences of tobacco use. The goal of this renewal application is to enhance smoking cessation rates for homeless smokers by testing the effects of 1) intensive smoking intervention, and 2) integrating alcohol abuse treatment with smoking cessation. We will utilize a 3- group randomized design to test study hypotheses. Findings from proposed research have a high potential to inform treatment of nicotine dependence and alcohol abuse in an underserved population that has been recalcitrant to treatments effective in the general population.

However, a lack of identifying markers make Beff difficult to study. Moreover, factors regulating the development and function of Beff are poorly understood leaving no approach to manipulate their activity. We have now discovered that TIM-4 identifies Beff that express a variety of effector molecules. Studies in this proposal will allow us to determine how these cells and their inflammatory mediators are regulated, providing critical insights necessary to manipulate their activity to promote allograft survival and inhibit autoimmunity.","1877888; ","ROTHSTEIN, DAVID M;","RICE, JEFFREY S.","08/18/2017","07/31/2018","Acute; Address; Affect; allograft rejection; Allograft Tolerance; Allografting; Alpha Cell; Anti-inflammatory; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Antigen Presentation; antimicrobial; Attenuated; Autoimmune Diseases; Autoimmune Process; Autoimmune Responses; Autoimmunity; B-Lymphocytes; Biology; Bone Marrow; Cell Communication; Cell physiology; Cell Shape; Cells; Chronic; Clinical; cytokine; Cytoplasmic Tail; Data; design; Development; Disease; Exhibits; Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis; Generations; Genetic Transcription; Goals; Graft Rejection; Heart Transplantation; Human; Humoral Immunities; Immune response; Immune Tolerance; immunoregulation; improved; Individual; Infection; Inflammation Mediators; Inflammatory; insight; Integrins; Interferon Type II; Interleukin-10; Interleukin-17; Interleukin-2; Interleukin-6; islet allograft; Isoantibodies; kidney allograft; Knockout Mice; Left; Ligation; MS4A1 gene; Mus; nano-string; novel; Outcome; Patients; Pattern; Peptides; Phenotype; Plasma Cells; Play; Production; programs; proteoglycan induced arthritis; Regulation; Regulator Genes; Regulatory Element; response; Rodent; Role; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; T-Lymphocyte; Therapeutic; Time; TNF gene; transcription factor; transcriptome; transcriptome sequencing; Transplant Recipients; Transplantation; tumor; Vascular Diseases; Work; ","Inflammatory B Cells Defined by TIM-4 in the Alloimmune Response","130034","TTT","Transplantation, Tolerance, and Tumor Immunology ","","","01","261527","109930","371457",""

Universally prescribed sedative medications-the GABA-ergic benzodiazepines-worsen this brain organ dysfunction. The available alternative sedation regimens, the shorter acting GABA-ergic propofol, and the alpha2 agonist, dexmedetomidine, have both been shown to be superior to benzodiazepines, and yet are different with regard to their effects on innate immunity, bacterial clearance, apoptosis, cognition and delirium. The MENDS II study will compare propofol and dexmedetomidine, and determine the best sedative medication to reduce delirium and improve survival and long-term brain function in our most vulnerable patients- the ventilated septic patient.

The ultimate goal is to reveal which cognitive and motivational processes (autonomous regulation in particular, or self-regulation in general) are optimal targets of self-regulation training, so as to facilitate the development of interventions to prevent trajectories of substance abuse, academic problems, risky sex, and other negative health consequences associated with drug and alcohol use during the transition to college.","9761591; ","PFEIFER, JENNIFER HOPE;","GRANT, STEVEN J","08/15/2017","07/31/2019","Address; Adolescence; Adolescent; adolescent substance use; Adult; Age; Alcohol consumption; alcohol cue; Alcohol or Other Drugs use; Alcohols; Appetite Regulation; Appetitive Behavior; Attitude; Automobile Driving; Behavior; Behavioral; Cognitive; cognitive process; cognitive reappraisal; college; Complex; cost; craving; Cues; Data; Dependence; design; Desire for food; Development; drug craving; drug development; Drug usage; Ethnic Origin; Family; Family Leave; Food; food craving; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Future; Gender; Goals; Health; Home environment; improved; Impulsivity; indexing; Individual; Individual Differences; Informal Social Control; Injury; Intervention; intrinsic motivation; Investigation; Measures; Meta-Analysis; Modeling; motivational processes; neural correlate; neural patterning; Neurobiology; neuroimaging; neuromechanism; Oregon; Outcome; Parents; Participant; Patient Self-Report; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Play; prevent; programs; Proxy; Reaction; Recruitment Activity; Regulation; relating to nervous system; Research; response; Rewards; Risk Factors; Role; Sampling; scaffold; Self-control as a personality trait; Services; sex; Sex Behavior; Signal Transduction; Societies; Stimulus; Structure; Study Subject; Substance abuse problem; Substance Addiction; success; Symptoms; teacher; Testing; theories; therapy design; therapy development; Time; Training; Treatment Efficacy; Universities; Work; Youth; ","Choosing to regulation: An fMRI investigation of autonomous versus controlled self-regulation and substance use in late adolescence","043015","PDRP","Psychosocial Development, Risk and Prevention Study Section ","","A1","01","150000","64067","214067",""

This is especially important since this phenomenon is observed across the majority of familial autistic syndromes, in which susceptibility is believed to be transmitted by autosomal variants (usually not by variations in sex chromosomes). The relevance of this is that interventions which mimic the mechanisms of reduction in severity observed in females can inform interventions that would be applicable to a large proportion of individuals with autism, who are affected by inherited liability across a diversity of genetic pathways.","1902475; ","CONSTANTINO, JOHN N.;","","","","Adult; Affect; Age; autism spectrum disorder; Autistic Disorder; autosome; Axon; base; Behavior; Behavioral; Biological Assay; Biological Models; Brain; Brain imaging; Categories; Cell Line; Cells; Child; child bearing; Clinical; cohort; Collaborations; Data; Data Set; Dendrites; design; Development; disorder risk; Enrollment; Epidemiology; Exhibits; experimental study; Family; Female; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; General Population; Genetic; Genetic Counseling; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genetic Variation; genome sequencing; Goals; Heterogeneity; Human; imaging study; Impairment; indexing; Individual; induced pluripotent stem cell; infancy; Infant; Inherited; Internet; Intervention; Investigation; Link; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; male; Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities Research Centers; Morphology; Mothers; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development; neuroimaging; Neurons; novel; offspring; Pathway interactions; Penetrance; Phase; Phenotype; Predisposition; Prevalence; proband; protective effect; Puberty; Publishing; Recording of previous events; Recruitment Activity; Recurrence; Registries; relating to nervous system; Reporting; Research Infrastructure; Research Project Grants; Resources; Rest; Risk; Series; Severities; sex; Sex Characteristics; Sex Chromosomes; Sex Functioning; Sex Ratio; sexual dimorphism; Siblings; Sister; Site; Susceptibility Gene; symptomatology; synaptic function; Syndrome; Testing; trait; Twin Studies; Universities; Variant; volunteer; Woman; X Chromosome; Y Chromosome; Youth; ","Sex-specific modulation of ASD liability: Compensatory mechanisms and recurrence","087011","ZHD1","Special Emphasis Panel ","8095","","03","182434","95778","","278212"

Proper healing of cutaneous wounds requires collective and coordinated cellular behavior that spans multiple length and time scales. To achieve a systems-level understanding of wound healing requires novel approaches to fuse observational scales that are relatively data-rich (signaling, cytoskeletal dynamics) with those that are data-poor (in vivo dynamics).

When the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein is inactive due to genetic mutation, the body loses the ability to secrete chloride ions into the fluid that lines the airways. Since salt in this fluid controls the total volume of the fluid decreases and the mucus in the airways becomes dehydrated. The loss of salt due to reduced chloride secretion is made worse by ENaC, which removes sodium from the airway fluid and further dehydrates the lung. ENaC inhibition can counteract the loss of fluid and accumulation of viscous, dehydrated mucus that blocks small airways and provides a nutrient source for bacterial growth. We have identified a novel peptide agent that inhibits ENaC activity and may provide a valuable new approach for treatment. We propose to test this novel peptide, known as SPX-101, for the treatment of CF.","10924007; ","WALKER, MATTHEW P;","SHERIDAN, JOHN T","08/15/2017","08/14/2018","absorption; Address; Adult; Advanced Development; Adverse effects; Age-Years; Agreement; Air; airway surface liquid; Amiloride; Animal Model; Bacteria; base; Binding; Biological Assay; Biological Sciences; Blood Circulation; bronchial epithelium; Canis familiaris; Cell membrane; Cells; Cessation of life; Chloride Ion; Chlorides; Chronic; Chronic lung disease; Climacteric; Clinic; Clinical; clinical application; Clinical Trials; cost; Cystic Fibrosis; cystic fibrosis airway; cystic fibrosis mouse; cystic fibrosis patients; Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator; Dehydration; Disease; disease-causing mutation; Diuresis; DNA Sequence Alteration; Dose; Epithelial; Epithelial Cells; epithelial Na+ channel; Epithelium; Exposure to; extracellular; Functional disorder; Goals; Grant; Growth; Half-Life; Health; Height; Human; Hydration status; Hyperactive behavior; hyperkalemia; improved; Incidence; Infection; inhibitor/antagonist; Intravenous infusion procedures; Kidney; Lead; Leukocyte Elastase; Life Expectancy; Liquid substance; Lung; Measures; Microscopic; Modeling; Molecular Target; Mucolytics; Mucous body substance; Mutation; Nebulizer; novel; novel strategies; novel therapeutics; Nutrient; Organ; overexpression; palliative; patient subsets; Patients; peptide drug; Peptides; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacology; Phase; Pilot Projects; Plasma; prevent; Proteins; Proteomics; Pulmonary Cystic Fibrosis; Quality of life; Rattus; Regulation; Saline; Sheep; Small Business Innovation Research Grant; small molecule; Sodium; Sodium Chloride; Source; success; Surface; Testing; Therapeutic; Tissues; Toxic effect; Toxicology; Transgenic Mice; Translating; translational study; Validation; water diffusion; Work; ","Validation of SPX-101 as a candidate for the treatment of cystic fibrosis","135956","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","01","","","222599",""

If successful, these studies could lead to the identification of drugs that could rapidly be developed into important and effective treatments for this and other significant chemical threats.","1902570; ","KONTOS, CHRISTOPHER D;","NADADUR, SRIKANTH ","08/15/2017","07/31/2020","Acute; Acute Lung Injury; Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome; Agonist; Albumins; Alveolar; Angiopoietin-2; ANGPT1 gene; Biological Assay; Blood capillaries; Blood Vessels; Breathing; Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid; capillary; Cell Count; Cessation of life; chemical threat; Chemicals; Chlorides; Clinical; cohort; Development; Dose; effective therapy; Endothelial Cells; Exploratory/Developmental Grant for Diagnostic Cancer Imaging; Exposure to; Extravasation; Functional disorder; Gases; Goals; Histamine; Human; In Vitro; in vivo; Inbred Mouse; Inbred Strains Mice; Inbreeding; Industrialization; Inflammation; inhibitor/antagonist; Injury; Lead; Ligands; Liquid substance; Lung; Medical; microCT; Modeling; mortality; mouse model; Mouse Strains; Mus; Nose; novel; Pathologic; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacology; Phosgene; phosphatase inhibitor; Population; Pre-Clinical Model; prevent; Prevention; Proteins; Pulmonary Edema; Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases; respiratory; screening; Secondary to; Sepsis; Serotonin; sex; Signal Transduction; small molecule inhibitor; Specificity; Syndrome; TEK gene; Testing; Therapeutic; Time; toxic industrial chemical; Translating; Treatment Efficacy; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors; vascular endothelial protein tyrosine phosphatase; Vascular Permeabilities; Work; ","TIE2 Activation for the Treatment of Chemical-Induced Acute Lung Injury","028187","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","300000","161955","461955",""

Developing a generalizable delivery technology that both targets transport- impaired drugs to and facilitates transport of these drugs across the blood brain barrier would dramatically expand our inventory of effective AD pharmaceuticals and transform the way clinicians seek to treat and prevent AD by providing the breadth of options needed to enable development of personalized AD treatment and prevention programs through evaluation of patient responses to different drug combinations. In this work, we will utilize state-of-the-art protein engineering methods to develop brain-targeted AD drug carrier proteins that efficiently shuttle systemically administered AD drugs from circulation to the CNS and thus bring to bear the increased numbers of viable AD drug candidates that practitioners must have to harness the tremendous potential of personalized medicine in treating and preventing this incapacitating condition.","10521830; ","HEINZELMAN, PETER J;","YANG, AUSTIN JYAN-YU","08/15/2017","05/31/2019","Adverse effects; Affinity; Alzheimer's Disease; Animals; Antibodies; Antibody-drug conjugates; ART protein; base; Binding; Binding Proteins; Biodistribution; Biological Assay; Biomedical Research; Blood - brain barrier anatomy; Blood Circulation; Blood groups; Brain; brain endothelial cell; brain tissue; California; Cardiac; Carrier Proteins; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell surface; Cell Surface Proteins; cell type; Cells; Central Nervous System Agents; Clinic; Clinical; cohort; crosslink; Cultured Cells; Cytometry; Data Set; Development; Diazomethane; Dissociation; Dose; drug candidate; Drug Carriers; Drug Combinations; Drug Targeting; Drug Transport; Endocytosis; Endothelial Cells; Engineering; Ensure; Epitopes; Equipment and supply inventories; Equus caballus; Escherichia coli; Evaluation; experimental study; expression vector; Family member; Fibronectins; Flow Cytometry; Fluorescence Microscopy; Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting; Friends; Goals; Hepatocyte; high throughput screening; Household; Human; Human Engineering; Immunohistochemistry; Impairment; Individual; Injectable; innovation; kidney cell; Libraries; Lung; Magnetism; Measurement; Measures; Mediating; Membrane; Methods; Microspheres; Molecular; Mus; nanoscale; Neuraxis; Outcome Measure; Patients; Performance; Peripheral; personalized medicine; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacologic Substance; Physiology; Population; Positioning Attribute; prevent; Prevention; Prevention program; Process; programs; Property; prophylactic; Prophylactic treatment; protein E; Protein Engineering; Proteins; Proteome; Publishing; Regimen; Research; Resources; response; screening; Specificity; Surface; tandem mass spectrometry; Targeted Research; Techniques; Technology; Therapeutic; Time; Tissues; transcytosis; Translations; treatment program; Universities; uptake; Ursidae Family; Vesicle; Water; Work; Yeasts; ","CytoBits - A High-Throughput Screening Innovation Enabling Engineering of Human Fibronectin Domains for Enhanced Brain Delivery of Alzheimer's Disease Therapeutics","056574","ISD","Instrumentation and Systems Development Study Section ","","","01","183000","55775","238775",""

It is expected that this study will provide the basis for us, and others, to map the macromolecular architecture of the entire synaptic basal lamina and establish the complete layout and sites of interaction of neural agrin, its receptors and the other filamentous proteins that constitute the synaptic basal lamina.

No cancer-specific service areas have been developed, even though there are an estimated 13 million Americans living who have had cancer, and 1.6 million new cancers diagnosed every year. The growing cancer population requires specialized care from diagnosis, through treatment, into survivorship, and sometimes palliation. We propose to develop Cancer Service Areas (CSAs) to provide a framework for more appropriately assessing the effectiveness of cancer care, rather than general hospital-based care. The CSAs will serve as cancer-specific units of comparison to evaluate services, plan resource allocation, and ultimately deliver better care.","7569691 (contact); 6759650; ","ONEGA, TRACY  (contact); WANG, FAHUI ;","TATALOVICH, ZARIA P","08/14/2017","07/31/2019","Address; American; American Society of Clinical Oncology; Area; Area Analyses; Atlases; base; beneficiary; cancer care; cancer diagnosis; Cancer Patient; care delivery; Caring; Censuses; Clinical; clinical phenotype; Communities; comparative; Complex; Congresses; Continuity of Patient Care; design; Detection; Development; Diagnosis; Effectiveness; Environment; Evaluation; Expenditure; Future; General Hospitals; Geographic Information Systems; Geography; Goals; Health; health care delivery; health care service utilization; Health Professional; Healthcare; Healthcare Market; Healthcare Systems; Hospital Referrals; Hospitalization; Hospitals; improved; indexing; Inpatients; Institute of Medicine (U.S.); interest; Malignant Neoplasms; Measurement; Measures; Medicare; Medicare claim; Methodology; Methods; Modeling; Network-based; novel; Oncologist; Outcome; Outpatients; palliation; Patient Care; patient oriented; patient population; Patients; Pattern; Policy Developments; Policy Maker; Population; Population Characteristics; pressure; programs; Quality of Care; Regional Cancer; Reporting; Resource Allocation; Resources; service utilization; Services; Specificity; Structure; survivorship; System; Technology; Testing; Time; Translating; Uncertainty; United States; user-friendly; Variant; Work; ","Automated Delineation of Cancer Service Areas","212687","HSOD","Health Services Organization and Delivery Study Section ","","A1","01","145395","75155","220550",""

Poor access to medical and prevention services leaves residents of many rural U.S. communities vulnerable to preventable harms of injection opioid abuse. The overall objective of this project is to implement an innovative yet widely replicable service delivery model which we have named the Community-Based, Client-Centered Prevention Home. The project will use mixed-methods to conduct a comprehensive needs assessment in 6 rural counties across Northern Wisconsin. Using an implementation science framework, we will develop and evaluate a service coordination model within an existing network of rural syringe service programs. Innovative features of this approach include use of a mobile health application to enhance the reach of prevention case managers, who will facilitate clients' access to a comprehensive package of 9 evidence-based prevention services.","1901466; 10486397 (contact); ","SEAL, DAVID W; WESTERGAARD, RYAN PATRICK (contact);","CRUMP, ARIA ","08/15/2017","07/31/2019","Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Address; Affect; Antiviral Agents; Area; base; Case Management; Case Manager; Cessation of life; Characteristics; Client; Clinical; Collaborations; Communicable Diseases; Communities; Comorbidity; County; Data; Data Collection; Epidemic; Epidemiology; ethnographic method; Evaluation; evidence base; experience; geographic inaccessibility; Geography; Goals; Harm Reduction; health application; Health Information System; health information technology; Health Services; Heroin; high risk; HIV; HIV/HCV; Home environment; implementation science; Individual; Injectable; Injecting drug user; Injection of therapeutic agent; innovation; Intervention; Legal; Medical; medication-assisted treatment; meetings; Methods; mHealth; Modeling; Names; Needs Assessment; novel; Opiate Addiction; Opioid; opioid abuse; opioid use; overdose death; person centered; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase; Population; Population Surveillance; prescription opioid abuse; Prevalence; prevent; Prevention; prevention service; Preventive Intervention; Program Effectiveness; programs; Provider; Public Health; public health relevance; Quantitative Evaluations; Questionnaires; Recruitment Activity; Research; Research Infrastructure; Resources; Respondent; response; Risk; Rural; Rural Community; rural counties; rural dwelling; Rural Population; Sampling; Services; Sexually Transmitted Diseases; Site; Source; success; Syringes; System; Testing; Time; Translating; trend; United States; uptake; Viral hepatitis; Virus; Wisconsin; World Health Organization; ","Community-based, client-centered prevention homes to address the rural opioid epidemic","044826","ZDA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","424096","197135","621231",""

Our goal is to develop a clinically effective and feasible hypothermia therapy that could serve as an adjunct to, or replace, the only FDA approved therapy, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). We have completed Phase I and II of this project. In Phase I, we synthesized and identified neurotensin receptor I derivatives for induction of hypothermia that served to dramatically decrease the size of an induced infarct. In Phase II, we demonstrated improvement of the therapeutic window of tPA with our lead, demonstrated the lack of negative behavioral and toxicity effects, and demonstrated that the hypothermic effect can be induced in non-human primates. In Phase IIb, other necessary preclinical studies will be completed and an IND will be written and submitted.","12192337 (contact); 10388484; ","DIX, THOMAS A.

The ability to provide real-time information about an individual's response to therapeutics has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by offering personalized treatment. Drugs with narrow therapeutic windows become toxic or ineffective if over- or under-dosed. Maintaining the most efficient dosage, personalized to the patient, can reduce toxicity, maximize efficacy of treatment, and ultimately improve patient outcome. Unfortunately, current methodologies for monitoring therapeutics are cumbersome (requiring tens of minutes to hours) and are performed removed from the point of care precluding real-time feedback. Biosensors represent a promising alternative but often fail to respond to specific targets when challenged in biological sample matrices. This failure is a result of biofouling, which masks the true sensor response. Here, we aim to leverage state-of-the-art bioanalytical science with biocompatible material (hydrogel) engineering to develop hybrid sensors capable of real-time continuous therapeutic drug monitoring in vivo. The specific goal is to couple the biocompatibility of hydrogel membranes with the rapid, selective, and specific recognition capabilities of electrochemical, aptamer-based (E-AB) sensors. The aims of the proposal are to first establish fundamental and universal sensor design and biomaterial engineering guidelines followed by the translation of the sensor to commercially engineered in vivo probes for multi- analyte detection. The short-term goal is to develop sensors for the real-time monitoring of the antibiotic tobramycin used for treatment of cystic fibrosis pulmonary exacerbations. In the long-term, combining the sensor development expertise of the PI and the biomaterial engineering expertise of the Co-PI, the general sensors developed here will be adapted to interface with a variety of biological interfaces including tissue and neuronal systems.","9107369; ","WHITE, RYAN J.;","FABIAN, MILES ","12/01/2015","11/30/2020","Antibiotics; aptamer; Architecture; base; Beds; biochip; Biocompatible Materials; Biological; biological systems; biomaterial compatibility; Biosensor; Blood; Chemicals; Chemistry; Clinic; clinically actionable; Collaborations; combat; Complex; Couples; Coupling; Data; design; Detection; Development; Diagnostic; dosage; Dose; Drug Monitoring; Electrodes; Engineering; Failure; Feedback; Formulation; Foundations; Goals; Guidelines; Healthcare; Hour; Hybrids; Hydrogels; improved; in vivo; Individual; individual patient; Intravenous; Knowledge; Masks; Membrane; Methodology; Modeling; Monitor; Nature; Neurons; ototoxicity; Patient-Focused Outcomes; Patients; Performance; personalized medicine; Pharmaceutical Preparations; point of care; polyacrylamide hydrogels; Pulmonary Cystic Fibrosis; Renal function; Research; Resolution; response; Sampling; Science; sensor; Signal Transduction; Silicon; small molecule; Specificity; Surface; System; temporal measurement; Testing; Therapeutic; Time; Tissues; Tobramycin; Toxic effect; Translations; Treatment Efficacy; Whole Blood; Work; ","Aptamer-Hydrogel Hybrid Sensors for Continuous Therapeutic Drug Monitoring","117159","ISD","Instrumentation and Systems Development Study Section ","","","03","103821","61773","165594",""
