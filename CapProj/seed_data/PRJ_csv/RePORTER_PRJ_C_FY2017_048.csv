Unfortunately, there is currently no effective treatment for men with CRPC. The present proposal directly deals with the mechanisms of this evolution of CRPC and has identified a novel factor involved in this process. Our hypothesis is that p52 activation promotes the development and progression of prostate cancer. In this proposal, we will study the role of p52 during prostate cancer progression to castration-resistance. Thus, this project targets CRPC, a very significant health problem among male veterans.

The classic motor symptoms of PD result from selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), resulting in a loss of their long-projecting axonal inputs to the striatum. We propose a novel regenerative medicine solution, whereby custom-built micro-tissue engineered neural networks (TENNs) are transplanted to physically reconstruct lost brain circuitry. We will assess the ability of preformed micro-TENNs to directly replace SNpc neurons, restore axonal inputs to the striatum, and ameliorate motor deficits in rodent and porcine models of PD. To enable future clinical translation, we will construct human-scale micro-TENNs using human stem cell derived dopaminergic neurons. This work will establish the clinical potential of personalized micro-TENNs to directly replace the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway and, as a result, alleviate the cause of motor symptoms for the millions of patient afflicted by PD.","9384437; ","CULLEN, DANIEL KACY;","","07/01/2017","06/30/2021","Address; Affect; Architecture; Asses; Axon; base; Behavioral; Biological Neural Networks; Brain; brain circuitry; Characteristics; Clinical; clinical translation; Clinical Treatment; connectome; Corpus striatum structure; Custom; Deafferentation procedure; Deep Brain Stimulation; Disease model; Dopamine; dopaminergic neuron; Electrophysiology (science); Embryo; Engineering; Family suidae; Fetal Tissue Transplantation; Future; Generations; Health; Histologic; Human; human adult stem cell; human stem cells; Hydrogels; Image; Implant; implantation; In Vitro; in vivo Model; Left; Maintenance; Medical center; Microinjections; Modeling; Motor; motor deficit; motor symptom; multidisciplinary; Nerve Degeneration; Nervous system structure; Nervous System Trauma; Neuroanatomy; Neurodegenerative Disorders; neuronal replacement; neuronal survival; Neurons; nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway; nigrostriatal pathway; novel; optogenetics; Outcome; Parkinson Disease; pars compacta; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pennsylvania; Phenotype; Philadelphia; Population; Process; Rattus; reconstruction; Regenerative Medicine; repaired; restoration; Rodent; stem cell biology; Stem cells; Structure; Substantia nigra structure; Symptoms; Synapses; System; Techniques; Technology; Testing; Tissue Engineering; Tissues; Transplantation; treatment strategy; Universities; Veterans; Work; ","Transplantable Micro-Tissue Engineered Neural Networks to Restore the Nigrostriatal Pathway in Parkinson's Disease","003748","NURE","Neurobiology E ","","","01","","","",""

Some individuals develop 'anorexia of aging' associated with reduced hunger and reward-related eating, yet others, however, remain or develop overweight and obesity. We do not understand the mechanisms for these findings and how appetite regulation is impacted by age. Because of how common obesity is older-aged individuals and the number of unanswered questions and controversies, it is critical to determine the mechanisms for the development and/or persistence of obesity in this population and whether the mechanisms are different from younger adults. Furthermore, better understanding appetite regulation in older individuals is critical if we are to properly manage this growing population. The overall goals of this pilot project are to begin to examine age- and obesity-related differences in the regulation of appetite using state-of-the-art methods, including brain imaging, measures of appetite and eating behaviors and measures of appetite related hormones.","2239588; ","CORNIER, MARC-ANDRE ;","","04/01/2016","03/31/2018","Adult; Age; age related; aged; Aging; Anorexia; Appetite Regulation; Appetitive Behavior; Attention; Behavior; Body Weight; Body Weight decreased; Brain imaging; Brain region; Cues; Desire for food; Development; Eating; Eating Behavior; Elderly; energy balance; Energy Intake; Energy Metabolism; Financial compensation; Food; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; ghrelin; glucagon-like peptide 1; Goals; High Prevalence; Hormones; Hunger; Impairment; Impulsivity; incentive salience; Individual; Knowledge; lean body mass; Leptin; Maintenance; Measures; Mediator of activation protein; Methods; Motivation; Neurons; Non obese; Obesity; obesity treatment; Overweight; Participant; Peptides; Pilot Projects; Play; Population; Primary Health Care; public health relevance; Regulation; Research; response; Rewards; Risk; Role; Satiation; Signal Transduction; success; Therapeutic; Veterans; Visual; Weight; Weight Gain; young adult; ","Appetite Regulation in Older-Aged Obese Individuals","001343","AGCG","Aging and Clinical Geriatrics ","","","02","","","",""

While kidney function can worsen over time, few studies have evaluated the trajectory or pattern of change in kidney function over time. In the proposed study, we will use VA data from older adults with multiple measures of kidney function over as many as six years to provide a detailed characterization of factors that shape disease trajectories in older adults.

Finally, we will ask older Veterans with CKD to report and rank the barriers that limit their ability to follow recommended CKD treatments.

Unfortunately, that distribution is severely disturbed in common pathological conditions including hypoxia and sepsis. The results are often life-threatening. Unfortunately, little is known about how blood flow distribution is controlled among lung capillaries. The prevailing theory, that is controlled by constriction and dilation of the arterioles that lie upstream, is challenged by reports by us and others, that suggest that the capillaries are not simply passive gas-exchanging vessels, but are capable of active control of perfusion within them. Our proposed studies are designed to investigate this novel idea using innovative analytical methods developed by us. Results of our studies have the potential to alter and expand our basic understanding of pulmonary microvascular flow regulation, and to lead to innovative new ways to treat the life threatening ventilation/perfusion abnormalities that frequently occur in common pathological conditions.","1880932; ","CONHAIM, ROBERT L;","","10/01/2013","03/31/2018","active control; Activities of Daily Living; Address; Affect; Alpha Particles; analog; analytical method; Anatomy; Angiotensin II; arteriole; Autologous; Blood; Blood capillaries; Blood flow; Blood Vessels; Bradykinin; Caliber; capillary; Clinical; Clinical Treatment; clinically relevant; Confocal Microscopy; constriction; Data; density; design; Development; Environmental air flow; Erythrocytes; Freezing; Gases; Goals; histological image; Hypoxia; improved; Infusion procedures; injured; innovation; Intervention; Latex Particles; Lead; Learning; Life; Lung; lung injury; Measures; Methods; Nitric Oxide Synthase; novel; particle; Pathologic; Perfusion; Pharmacology; public health relevance; Reducing Agents; Regulation; Reporting; Respiratory physiology; response; Rho-associated kinase; Role; Sepsis; septic; Serotonin; Site; theories; Thromboxanes; Time; Translating; treatment group; vasoactive agent; vasoconstriction; Vasoconstrictor Agents; venule; ","Role of Lung Microvascular Vasoactivity in Control of Lung Capillary Perfusion","001867","PULM","Respiration ","","","04","","","",""

Therefore, selectively targeting STAT3 signaling for the therapeutic intervention in medulloblastoma is desirable and should have high impact. We have developed an oral bioavailable STAT3-selective inhibitor LY5 with good blood-brain barrier penetration activity, which is considered a major break-through for STAT3-targeting therapy in brain tumors such as in medulloblastoma, because many new anti-cancer drugs that are effective outside the brain have failed in clinical trials against brain tumors, in part due to poor penetration across the blood-brain barrier. We propose to examine the upstream signaling responsible for STAT3 activation in medulloblastoma, STAT3 activation in four subgroups, and to evaluate the biologic activity of combined LY5 with irradiation and cisplatin treatments using medulloblastoma mouse models. Our long-term goal is to target STAT3 as a potent and potentially less toxic therapeutic approach for pediatric medulloblastoma with the ultimate goal of improving the overall survival rate for medulloblastoma.","3151896; ","LIN, JIAYUH ;","FOUNTAIN, JANE W.","06/08/2016","05/31/2020","Address; Adverse effects; angiogenesis; Antineoplastic Agents; Apoptosis; base; Bioavailable; Biological; Biological Availability; Biological Markers; Blood; Blood - brain barrier anatomy; Brain; Brain Neoplasms; cancer therapy; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Cells; Cellular Assay; Child; Childhood Medulloblastomas; circulating microRNA; Cisplatin; Clinical; Clinical Trials; cytokine; Data; Drug Kinetics; Drug resistance; Drug Targeting; Exhibits; Goals; Growth Factor; Human; Immune Evasion; Immunocompetent; improved; in vivo Model; Individual; Induction of Apoptosis; inhibitor/antagonist; irradiation; Malignant neoplasm of brain; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; medulloblastoma; medulloblastoma cell line; MicroRNAs; migration; Modeling; Molecular; Morbidity - disease rate; mouse model; Mus; Normal Cell; novel; Oncogenic; Oral; Outcome; Pathway interactions; Patients; Penetration; Phosphorylation; Plasma; Primary Neoplasm; Progressive Disease; PTPRC gene; public health relevance; Radiation; radiation resistance; Radiation therapy; research clinical testing; Role; Sampling; SHH gene; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Slide; Small Interfering RNA; Stat3 protein; Subgroup; Survival Rate; targeted treatment; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Intervention; Tissue Microarray; Tissues; Toxic effect; Treatment Efficacy; tumor; tumor growth; Tumor Volume; tumorigenesis; Xenograft procedure; ","A novel STAT3-selective inhibitor for medulloblastoma therapy","087213","DT","Developmental Therapeutics Study Section ","","","03","255156","84528","339684",""

By the end of Fiscal Year 2012, a total of 971,990 Veterans were service connected for tinnitus. Interventions purporting to reduce the perception of tinnitus show promise, but they require accurate and reliable measurement of perceptual characteristics of tinnitus, which is the focus of this study. The project will result in normative standards of outcome measures that can be utilized immediately upon completion of the study. The Tinnitus Evaluation System (TES) is a fully functional automated testing system that will be used to obtain the measures. Concurrently, the TES will be upgraded to a single-unit testing system by our engineering team. Completion of the project will result in normative data and state-of-the-art instrumentation that will contribute  toward obtaining valid and reliable assessments of tinnitus perceptual characteristics. Reaching this goal can impact VA audiology clinics that routinely obtain these measures with Veterans.","1906655; ","HENRY, JAMES A;","","07/01/2015","06/30/2018","Adult; Affect; Age; analog; Audiology; Auditory; Characteristics; Chronic; Clinic; Clinical; Clinical Research; Computers; Consensus; Data; Devices; disability; Effectiveness; emotional distress; Engineering; Enrollment; Esthesia; Evaluation; Evidence based intervention; experience; Frequencies; Funding; Goals; Head; Hearing; indexing; Individual; Industrialization; instrumentation; Intervention; Loudness; Manuals; Masks; Measurement; Measures; Methods; Military Personnel; Noise; Numeric Rating Scale; Operative Surgical Procedures; Outcome; Outcome Measure; Patients; Perception; Pharmacotherapy; Prevalence; Procedures; Psychoacoustics; public health relevance; Questionnaires; Reaction; Reference Standards; Reporting; Research Personnel; response; Sampling; Services; Sleep disturbances; sound; standard measure; Standardization; System; Techniques; Technology; Testing; Time; Tinnitus; touchscreen; Treatment Efficacy; Update; Variant; Veterans; Visual; ","Establishing Normative Standards for Measures of Tinnitus Perception","001205","RRD3","Sensory Systems/Communication Disorders ","","","03","","","",""

These provisions form the foundation of a coordinated global attempt to protect people around the world from the dangers of the number one risk factor for non-communicable disease, tobacco use. Similarly, rigorously capturing the nature of these livelihoods will equip public health proponents with the information necessary to counter these tobacco industry strategies more effectively. Government officials and civil society organizations in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) will use this research to inform their strategies to address the tobacco industry's myths about the alleged harms of tobaccocontrol to tobacco farmers in order to protect existing and to promote better public health legislation. The research will also help to inform governments' attempts to encourage tobacco af rmers to try other economically viable livelihoods, which is not only a provision of the WHO FCTC (Article 17), but also central to healthier lives for the millions of tobacco farmers in LMICs.","11053618; ","DROPE, JEFFREY ;","LEVINTOVA, MARYA ","08/22/2012","06/30/2022","Address; Advocate; Africa; Africa South of the Sahara; African; Agriculture; Ally; American; Area; Attention; burden of illness; civil society; cohort; Collaborations; Complement; Complex; Consultations; Consumption; Country; Data; Disease; Economic Policy; Economics; Educational workshop; Environment; experience; falls; farmer; Financial Support; Focus Groups; Fostering; Foundations; Gap Junctions; Goals; Government; Government Officials; graduate student; Health Legislation; Health Policy; Home environment; improved; Income; Individual; Indonesia; Industry; Institution; Intervention; Interview; Kenya; Label; Level of Evidence; Literature; Logistics; low and middle-income countries; Malawi; Marketing; Measures; member; Mentorship; multidisciplinary; Nature; North America; Outcome; Participant; Policies; Policy Analysis; Politics; Postdoctoral Fellow; preference; Prevalence; Process; programs; Public Health; public policy on tobacco; Recommendation; Reporting; Research; Research Personnel; Risk Factors; Sampling; Scholarship; Series; Shapes; Side; skills; Smoke; Southeastern Asia; Structure; Students; Surveys; symposium; Taxation; Time; Tobacco; tobacco control; Tobacco Industry; Tobacco use; Training; Universities; Visit; Work; World Health Organization; Zambia; ","The Political Economy of Tobacco Farming in Low-and Middle-Income Countries","010898","ZCA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","06","264040","33780","297820",""

Sexual violence has been recognized to have dire and long lasting personal and public health consequences. Bullying, sexual violence, and dating violence appear to be related to the development of sexual violence across the lifespan. This study will evaluate the differential efficacy of the Second Step: Student Success Through Prevention program (Second Step) versus a gender-enhanced Second Step program (Second Step +) on reducing bullying, sexual harassment, gender-based harassment, and teen dating violence among a large sample of 6th and 7th graders across 28 Illinois middle schools; assess the extent to which gender-enhanced Second Step versus Second Step results in greater increases in positive bystander intervention around bullying, sexual harassment, gender-based harassment, and teen dating violence; test the extent to which the intervention impacts peer-level attitudes toward bullying, sexual harassment, homophobic name-calling, and teen dating violence through its effect on peer social dynamics; and assess whether intervention fidelity will moderate program effects on targeted outcomes. This study is highly innovative and could have substantial public health impact by targeting bullying, dating violence, and sexual harassment but by going further to include harassment and violence pertaining to sexual orientation and/or gender-role nonconformity. The study will be the first school-based RCT to specifically examine the efficacy of a gender-enhanced social-emotional learning middle school program with school- wide strategies against a social emotional learning program condition only.","6110388; ","ESPELAGE, DOROTHY L;","","09/30/2013","09/29/2017","","Randomized Trial of a Gender Enhanced Middle School Violence Prevention Program","002340","ZCE1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","04","","","148754",""

Many exercise programs exist to improve bone density, but it is not clear if bone strength also increases. Bone strength may be more predictive of fracture because it assesses how much stress bone can handle before it breaks. There are two type of exercise known to impact bone health: ground reaction forces (GRF) and joint reaction forces (JRF). GRF are weight-bearing exercises, like walking and climbing/descending stairs. JRF exercises, like weight lifting and aerobic rowing, rely on muscle forces to stress bone. The purpose of this study is to investigate if GRF and JRF influences bone density and strength in an aging population. Older adult men and women will participate in either GRF or JRF exercise 3 times per week. Bone density/strength will be measured before/after 24 weeks of exercise to see if either group changes favorably. Based on results from this study, future research can be done to see if there is 'optimal' exercise to improve bone health with age.","9409858; ","BOXER, REBECCA SUE;","","07/01/2016","06/30/2018","Aerobic; Affect; Age; age related; aged; Aging; aging population; Animals; Architecture; Arthritis; base; bisphosphonate; bone; Bone Density; bone geometry; bone health; bone mass; bone strength; bone stress; Bone structure; Clinical; combat; Computer Analysis; Computer Simulation; Data; Degenerative polyarthritis; early onset; Elderly; Exercise; exercise prescription; exercise program; exercise training; experience; Face; Failure; Finite Element Analysis; Forteo; Foundations; Fracture; fracture risk; functional disability; Future; Goals; high risk; Hip Fractures; Hip region structure; Human; Image Analysis; Impairment; improved; Incidence; innovation; Intervention; Joints; Lead; Life; Measures; mechanical load; men; Methods; Military Personnel; Modeling; Muscle; Neck; novel; older men; older women; Orthopedics; Osteoporosis; osteoporosis with pathological fracture; Participant; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pilot Projects; Population; Positioning Attribute; preclinical study; prevent; Protocols documentation; public health relevance; Randomized; randomized trial; Reaction; Recommendation; Research; response; Risk; Rodent; Science; service member; Services; sex; Shapes; Site; Spinal Fractures; Stress; Supervision; Techniques; Technology; Three-Dimensional Image; Time; Trochanters; Vertebral column; Veterans; Walking; Weight Lifting; Weight-Bearing state; Woman; X-Ray Computed Tomography; ","Effects of Two Exercise Programs on Bone Strength and Architecture","001340","AGCG","Aging and Clinical Geriatrics ","","","02","","","",""

Although it is now clear in humans that early life pain and stress are a risk factor for later mental health issues, the mechanisms by which this occur remain unclear. Our overarching hypothesis is that the effect of early life trauma on predisposition to anxiety disorders is mediated by alterations of corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) in the amygdala, creating an enhanced susceptibility to fear conditioning and alterations in the descending pain circuit. Thus, this proposal will provide data to suggest that early life pain and stress create a long- lasting susceptibility to fear learning and anxiety.","8966981; ","BURMAN, MICHAEL A;","FREUND, LISA S","08/21/2017","07/31/2020","11 year old; Adolescence; Adolescent; Adult; Affect; Affective; Afferent Pathways; Age; Age of Onset; Agreement; Amygdaloid structure; Anesthesia procedures; Animal Experiments; Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; base; Behavior; Behavioral; behavioral study; Belief; Brain; Caring; Child; Child Rearing; Childhood; Clinical; Cognitive; conditioned fear; Corticosterone; Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone; Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone Receptors; Data; depressive symptoms; design; Development; Disease model; early adolescence; early childhood; Early-life trauma; Emotional; Event; experimental study; Face; Freezing; Fright; Functional disorder; Heel; Human; Hypersensitivity; Hypothalamic structure; hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis; Immunohistochemistry; Incidence; Inflammatory; Injection of therapeutic agent; Injury; insight; Intervention; Lead; Learning; Life; Limbic System; Link; Literature; Long-Term Effects; maternal separation; mature animal; Measures; Mediating; Medical; Mental Depression; Mental Health; Modeling; Moods; Nature; Neonatal; Neonatal Intensive Care Units; neonate; Neurobiology; Newborn Infant; novel; Odors; Pain; Pain Threshold; Painless; Pathway interactions; Pharmacology; Phase; Phenotype; Phobias; Pituitary-Adrenal System; Play; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders; predictive modeling; Predisposition; Procedures; Psychological Models; Rattus; receptor; receptor density; receptor expression; Reflex action; Reporting; Risk; Risk Factors; Role; Sensory; sensory system; Signal Transduction; somatosensory; Source; Stress; Stressful Event; Structure; successful intervention; System; Tactile; Testing; Time; Trauma; Work; ","Neonatal Trauma Alters Subsequent Fear and Sensory Function via Changes in Limbic CRF and CORT","091841","BRLE","Biobehavioral Regulation, Learning and Ethology Study Section ","","","01","299420","126425","425845",""

In addition to activation of the immune system and inflammation, psoriasis is characterized by excessive growth and abnormal maturation of cells comprising the skin. Ours and others' research has suggested that the transporter aquaporin-3 (AQP3), which transports water, glycerol and hydrogen peroxide, plays a key role in regulating skin function, and its levels seem to be altered in various skin diseases, including psoriasis. The  possible role of AQP3 in human skin disorders emphasizes the importance of understanding the mechanisms that control AQP3 function. In the proposed research we will define the mechanisms regulating AQP3 expression and perform proof-of- principle studies to determine whether drugs that enhance AQP3 levels and/or the substance AQP3 transports, glycerol, might be beneficial for the treatment of psoriasis.","1867380; ","BOLLAG, WENDY B;","","07/01/2016","06/30/2020","Acetylation; Adverse effects; Affect; aquaporin 3; base; Biopsy; Cell Maturation; Cells; Chromatin; chromatin immunoprecipitation; Clinical; Collaborations; Data; Deacetylation; Development; Diffuse; Disease; Dose; Enterobacteria phage P1 Cre recombinase; Enzymes; Epidermis; Epigenetic Process; Exhibits; expectation; Family; Genes; Genetic Transcription; Glycerol; Growth; HDAC1 gene; HDAC3 gene; Health; Histone Deacetylase; Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor; Histones; Human; Hydration status; Hydrogen Peroxide; Imiquimod; Immune; immune activation; Immune system; Impaired wound healing; Impairment; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; in vivo Model; Inflammation; inhibitor/antagonist; Keratin; keratinocyte; keratinocyte differentiation; knock-down; Knockout Mice; Laboratories; Lead; Lesion; Lipids; LoxP-flanked allele; Measures; Mediating; member; Messenger RNA; Monitor; mouse model; mRNA Expression; Mus; Mutation; novel; Organ Culture Techniques; overexpression; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacology; Phenotype; Phosphatidylglycerols; phospholipase D2; Physiological; Play; Population; Process; Proliferating; promoter; protein expression; Proteins; Psoriasis; public health relevance; Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR; repaired; Reporter; Reporting; Research; Research Personnel; Resolution; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA Interference; Role; Sampling; Second Messenger Systems; Signal Transduction; Skin; skin disorder; Skin Physiology; Structure; Testing; Therapeutic; TP53 gene; transcription factor; Transgenic Mice; United States; Up-Regulation; Veterans; Water; ","Epidermal Aquaporin-3 in Psoriasis","001357","IMMA","Immunology A ","","","02","","","",""

Its expression is silenced in colon cancer. Despite overwhelming in vitro data supporting a tumor-suppressive role of this transporter in colon, in vivo studies using Slc5a8-/- mice failed to provide evidence in support of such a function. Our recent studies have shown that Slc5a8 is indeed a blocker of colonic inflammation and a suppressor of colon cancer but only under conditions of low dietary fiber intake. Based on these data, we hypothesize that SLC5A8 is a conditional tumor suppressor in colon whose ability to block colitis and colon cancer is related to the dietary fiber content.

MM with bone disease has the highest total treatment cost of any cancer type: more than the total cost for much more common lung cancer cases. Destruction of bone by MM cells results in pain, fracture and other complications, and MM remains incurable. The work proposed will test the role of a factor uniquely made by bone (FGF23) which stimulates heparanase, a causal agent of bone disease. Drugs against both FGF23 and heparanase are in clinical trials and could rapidly be brought to the clinic for treatment of MM. Other cancers, such as breast and prostate, that also attack bone and affect the VA patient population, may use the same mechanisms in bone and could be treated with the same drugs.","1860658 (contact); 8235554; ","CHIRGWIN, JOHN M (contact); SUVANNASANKHA, ATTAYA ;","","07/01/2014","06/30/2018","Adhesions; Affect; Affinity; African American; Age; animal pain; Animals; Automobile Driving; base; Binding; Biological Assay; Biology; bone; Bone Diseases; bone growth factor; Bone Matrix; Bone neoplasms; Bone Resorption; Bortezomib; Breast; Calvaria; cancer type; cell growth; Cell Line; cell type; Cells; Cessation of life; Clinic; Clinical; Clinical Trials; cost; Cultured Cells; Data; Diagnosis; Endocrine; Enzymes; Etiology; Experimental Models; experimental study; fibroblast growth factor 23; Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptors; Fracture; Future; Gene Targeting; Genes; Genetic Transcription; Growth; Growth Factor; heparanase; HGF gene; Homing; Hormone Receptor; Hormones; Human; improved; Incidence; Individual; individual patient; inhibitor/antagonist; interest; Laboratories; Luciferases; Malignant Bone Neoplasm; Malignant neoplasm of lung; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediator of activation protein; Messenger RNA; Metastatic Neoplasm to the Bone; Minerals; Molecular; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; mouse model; Multiple Myeloma; Mus; Myeloma Proteins; Newly Diagnosed; Organ Culture Techniques; Osteoblasts; Osteoclasts; Osteocytes; Osteogenesis; Osteolysis; Osteolytic; outcome forecast; Pain; Pathology; Pathway interactions; patient population; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Plasma Cells; Population; Production; promoter; Prostate; Proteasome Inhibitor; public health relevance; receptor; Recombinants; Regulation; Research Personnel; response; Role; Sampling; Serum; Skeleton; Source; syndecan; Testing; Time; TNFSF11 gene; TRANCE protein; transcription factor; Treatment Cost; tumor; tumor growth; Work; ","Role of Osteocytes in Myeloma Bone Disease","000977","ENDB","Endocrinology B ","","","04","","","",""

We have discovered for the first time, that a protein kinase MLK3 is highly active in PDA and is involved in the activation of an oncogene, Pin1 that finally activate a well- recognized oncogene, Gli1 in PDA. Thus, we propose to determine the role of MLK3-Pin1-Gli1 axis in animal models of PDA, and to examine the application of MLKs and Pin1 inhibitors, as potential therapeutic approach for PDA treatment. These studies accord with the mission of the V.A. Med.

The processes underlying our brain's ability to perform this function, however, are complex. Overlapping networks have to combine auditory information (what we actually hear) and visual information (mouth movements) into a coherent perception. This processing has to occur on a rapid timescale, on the order of hundreds of milliseconds, which is the tempo of arrival of individual units of speech (syllables). In this proposal, we study how fluctuations in neuronal activity ? oscillations ? play a key role in processing speech information.

NK-mediated killing is an attractive candidate for targeting of CSCs following the depletion of non-CSCs by conventional therapies.

Sarcomas are more prevalent in children, and there are over 50 sub-types known. There is a real problem because, at the molecular level, they are as different from each other as they are from the carcinomas, yet they are all treated the same. In this proposal, we hypothesize that commonality among sarcomas can be found in their physiology. Importantly, these physiologies can be targeted with specific drugs and, even more important, these physiologies can be imaged with MRI. We call these physiologies 'habitats' because multiple different physiological environments can co-exist within a single tumor, and they are defined by their MRI-measurable blood supply and cell density. For this proposal, we will target our therapies against areas with high cell density, because that's where the cancer cells are. Within these areas, if the habitat has an abundant blood supply, we will use doxorubicin, a standard chemotherapy agent that relies on an adequate blood supply to work. If the blood supply is lacking, we will target those areas with a new class of drugs that are active in oxygen-poor environments; the so-called hypoxia activated pro-drugs (HAPs). Thus, by imaging the habitats, we can we propose to use imaging to determine what kind of drugs, and in what order, sarcoma patients should receive.","1858946; 9880120 (contact); ","GILLIES, ROBERT J.; MARTINEZ, GARY  (contact);","ZHANG, HUIMING ","08/01/2017","07/31/2019","Acute; Affect; Algorithms; Area; base; Biochemistry; Blood Cells; cancer cell; Carcinoma; Caring; Cell Density; Cell Line; chemotherapy; Child; Childhood; Clinic; Clinical; Connective Tissue; contrast enhanced; Data Set; Diffusion; Disease; Disease remission; Dose; Doxorubicin; Drug Targeting; Environment; Evaluation; Excision; expectation; flexibility; Habitats; Half-Life; Histologic; Histology; Hypoxia; Image; imaging biomarker; Immunohistochemistry; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; Individual; Intention; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; malignant breast neoplasm; Malignant neoplasm of lung; Malignant neoplasm of pancreas; Malignant neoplasm of prostate; Malignant Neoplasms; Measurable; Measures; Mesenchymal; Metabolic; Methods; Molecular; Molecular Profiling; Monitor; Morphology; Mus; New Agents; novel drug class; Oxygen; Oxygen Consumption; patient stratification; Patients; Perfusion; Pharmaceutical Preparations; phase III trial; Phenotype; Physiologic pulse; Physiological; Physiology; Plasma; pre-clinical; Preclinical Testing; predicting response; predictive marker; Prodrugs; programs; Progression-Free Survivals; public health relevance; Pyruvate; Radiology Specialty; response; sarcoma; Scanning; Schedule; Soft tissue sarcoma; Solid Neoplasm; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Effect; Therapy trial; Tissues; Toxic effect; Translating; treatment planning; treatment strategy; trial design; tumor; Tumor stage; Tumor Tissue; Uncertainty; Unresectable; Vascular blood supply; virtual; Work; ","Imaging Habitats in Sarcoma","187532","","","","S1","03","182947","66942","249889",""

Recent evidence clearly demonstrates High intensity interval training (HIIT), which alternates brief high-intensity efforts with brief recovery periods, is a very effective and time-efficient alternative to 'conventional' exercise (i.e., moderate intensity continuous exercise). However, little is known about metabolic adaptations stemming from HIIT and less is known about optimizing HIIT regimens specifically for improvements in metabolic health. Moreover, while available evidence demonstrates HIIT can induce impressive health benefits after a few to several weeks of training, the ability/willingness of obese adults to adhere to HIIT programs over the long term is not known. Our overall goals are to: 1) comprehensively assess mechanisms underlying HIIT-induced improvements in insulin resistance at the whole-body, tissue, and cellular levels, 2) systematically evaluate the impact of different 'doses' of HIIT that may be optimal for improving metabolic health in obese adults, and 3) assess the ability/willingness of obese subjects to adhere to long-term HIIT programs.","1869449; ","HOROWITZ, JEFFREY F;","LAUGHLIN, MAREN R","04/13/2010","12/31/2020","Address; Adherence; Adipose tissue; Adult; Blood Circulation; blood glucose regulation; blood lipid; Body fat; Body Weight; Ceramides; Clinical; Clinical Markers; design; diabetic patient; Dose; Energy Metabolism; Exercise; exercise adherence; exercise prescription; exercise program; exercise regimen; Exercise Therapy; exercise training; Fatty Acids; fitness; Glucose; Goals; Health; Health Benefit; Heart Rate; Hepatic; impaired glucose tolerance; improved; Infiltration; Inflammatory; inflammatory marker; Insulin Resistance; insulin sensitivity; insulin signaling; Interval training; Lipids; macrophage; Metabolic; Metabolic Marker; Muscle; Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; Obesity; obesity treatment; Outcome; Pathway interactions; Peripheral; Prevention; Program Development; programs; public health relevance; Recovery; Regimen; response; Skeletal Muscle; stem; Stimulus; Supervision; Time; Tissues; Training; Training Programs; Variant; willingness; ","Insulin sensitivity and fatty acid partitioning in skeletal muscle after exercise","077966","CIDO","Clinical and Integrative Diabetes and Obesity Study Section ","","S1","07","65679","16657","82336",""

This process, called viral latency, is a major barrier to eradicating HIV-1 infection. While significant progress has been made in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of HIV latency, our understanding is incomplete. In particular, the relevance of drugs of abuse on this process has not been studied in details. Given the fact that a significant fraction of HIV-infected patients are also drug abusers, there isa need to better understand the role of drugs of abuse on the establishment, the maintenance and reactivation of latent HIV.  Here, we propose to explore on a genomic scale the landscape of cellular factors that regulate HIV latency establishment and maintenance and their relationship to drugs of abuse. We will use genome scale screens to identify cellular genes that control latency maintenance and reactivation and their relationship to drugs of abuse with a particular focus on methamphetamine. We also propose to further develop new HIV-1 reporter viruses to study latency in vitro. Using these new tools, we can study the role of drugs of abuse in the establishment, maintenance and reactivation of latent HIV. By combining the power of our new latency model with high-resolution systems-biology techniques, we are uniquely suited to map out the cellular regulatory networks that control HIV latency and the role of drugs of abuse in this process.","1890767; ","VERDIN, ERIC M.;","PUROHIT, VISHNUDUTT ","04/15/2016","02/28/2021","antiretroviral therapy; base; Binding Sites; Biological; Blood; CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes; Cell Line; cell type; Cells; Cessation of life; Chimeric Proteins; Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats; Cocaine; Collaborations; CRISPR interference; CRISPR/Cas technology; crosslink; Data; differential expression; Drug abuser; drug of abuse; Drug user; env Gene Products; Epigenetic Process; exhaustion; Exhibits; Experimental Models; experimental study; Fluorescence; follow-up; FRAP1 gene; Gene Expression; Genes; Genetic Epistasis; Genetic Transcription; Genome; genome-wide; genome-wide analysis; Genomics; Goals; Guide RNA; HIV; HIV Genome; HIV Infections; HIV-1; Human; illicit drug use; In Vitro; Individual; Infection; innovation; Killings; Label; Lymphoid Cell; Maintenance; Maps; memory CD4 T lymphocyte; Methamphetamine; methamphetamine effect; Modeling; Molecular; Mononuclear; mTOR Inhibitor; new technology; novel; novel therapeutics; Paint; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phenotype; Process; Proteins; public health relevance; reactivation from latency; Regulation; Reporter; Repression; Resolution; response; Rest; RNA; Role; Shock; small hairpin RNA; small molecule; small molecule inhibitor; synergism; Systems Biology; T-Cell Activation; Techniques; Technology; Testing; tool; transcription factor; transcriptome sequencing; United States; Viral; Viral Load result; Viral reservoir; Virus; Virus Integration; Virus Latency; ","Molecular Mechanisms of HIV Latency","041742","ZDA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","03","659154","619605","1278759",""

However, for patients weaning from mechanical ventilation, dyssynchrony between the ventilator rhythm and the patient's spontaneous breathing rhythm could lead to increased/wasted work of breathing, patient discomfort, increased need for sedation, higher rate of tracheostomy, longer durations of mechanical ventilation and reduced number of ventilator-free days, longer ICU and hospital stay, and lower probabilities of survival and home discharge. This pilot clinical study will test a next-generation ventilatory assist mode called entrainment-based mechanical ventilation that is based on the classical physics theory of mutual entrainment between coupled oscillators, which may provide a cost-effective solution to this clinical problem.","6254466; ","POON, CHI-SANG ;","REINECK, LORA A.","09/15/2015","05/31/2019","Accident and Emergency department; Acute; Acute respiratory failure; Address; Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome; Age; Award; base; Basic Life Support; Bennett model; Biomedical Engineering; Brain; Breathing; Chronic; Clinical; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials; Collaborations; Complex; Computer software; computerized; cost; cost effective; Coupled; Cross-Over Studies; Dancing; Dependency; design; Devices; Economic Inflation; Effectiveness; Eligibility Determination; Engineering; Environmental air flow; FDA approved; Future; Generations; Goals; Grant; Health Care Costs; Home environment; Hospitalization; Hour; improved; Incidence; Individual; innovation; Intensive Care Units; Interdisciplinary Study; Intuition; Investigation; Lead; Learning; Legal patent; Length of Stay; Letters; Life; Long-Term Care; Lung; Mechanical ventilation; Mechanical Ventilators; Mediating; Medical; Memory; Modeling; mortality; Multicenter Trials; Muscle; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; next generation; Nosocomial Infections; novel; Operating Rooms; Outcome; Paralysed; patient population; Patients; Persons; Phase; Phase III Clinical Trials; Physics; Pilot Projects; Probability; Procedures; prospective; prototype; public health relevance; Reflex action; Rehabilitation therapy; Research; research clinical testing; Research Design; Research Personnel; respiratory; Respiratory Failure; Risk; risk minimization; Safety; safety and feasibility; Secure; Sedation procedure; simulation; Slave; Techniques; Technology; Testing; theories; Tracheostomy procedure; Translating; United States National Institutes of Health; Ventilator; Ventilator Weaning; Weaning; Work of Breathing; ","Entrainment-based mechanical ventilation to improve patient-ventilator synchrony","125859","CLTR","Clinical Trials Review Committee ","","","02","210750","38027","248777",""

In this application, we will explore the relationship between various cancers and AD in a national database of over 3.5 million Veterans. We will closely examine the association between anti-cancer agents and AD risk to determine if they might be repositioned as treatment or chemoprevention for AD.

Although several molecularly targeted therapies have been developed, only small percentage of patients responds to such therapies and drug resistance develops following prolonged treatment. In addition, it is often difficult to develop treatment of certain categories f lung cancer (such as those bearing K-RAS mutation). We recently discovered that a cell-surface molecule, called EphA2, is required for tumor cell viability in lung cancers that are refractory to available targeted treatments. Our overall goal of this project is to determine the efficacy of targeting EphA2 in lung cancers, to elucidate how EphA2 functions in tumor, and to test new drugs targeting EphA2 in subtypes of lung cancer that are currently refractory to targeted therapies.","1865821; ","CHEN, JIN ;","","04/01/2009","03/31/2018","actionable mutation; Affect; Alpha Cell; Animal Model; Antibodies; anticancer research; Apoptosis; base; Biochemical; Biology; Cancer Biology; cancer cell; Cancer cell line; Cancer Etiology; Cancer Model; cancer subtypes; Categories; cell behavior; Cell Culture Techniques; cell growth; Cell physiology; Cell Proliferation; Cell surface; Cell Survival; Cells; Cessation of life; Chemicals; Clinical; Collaborations; Data; Development; Disease; Drug resistance; efficacy testing; Eph Family Receptors; EphA2 Receptor; Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor; Exhibits; FRAP1 gene; gain of function; Gatekeeping; genome-wide analysis; Goals; Gray unit of radiation dose; Half-Life; Human; Image; improved; In Situ; In Vitro; in vivo; Incidence; inhibitor/antagonist; insight; Investigation; JUN gene; kinase inhibitor; knock-down; KRAS2 gene; Lead; Lesion; Luciferases; lung development; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Malignant neoplasm of lung; Malignant Neoplasms; MAP Kinase Gene; MAPK8 gene; Measures; Mediating; Metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain; Molecular; Molecular Target; molecular targeted therapies; Monitor; mouse model; multidisciplinary; mutant; Mutation; Neoplasm Metastasis; neoplastic cell; new therapeutic target; Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma; novel; Oncogenic; overexpression; Pathway interactions; Patients; personalized medicine; personalized therapeutic; Pharmaceutical Chemistry; Pharmacology; Phosphoproteins; Phosphorylation; Phosphotransferases; Population; Proteins; Proteomics; public health relevance; Recurrent disease; Refractory; Resistance; Resistance development; response; rho; Role; Sampling; screening; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; small molecule; small molecule inhibitor; Smoking; Specificity; Specimen; src-Family Kinases; stem; success; Survival Rate; targeted treatment; Technology; Testing; Therapeutic; Time; Toxic effect; Transgenic Organisms; tumor; tumor growth; Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor; United States; Veterans; Xenograft procedure; ","Targeting EphA2 in lung cancer subtypes that are refractory to current therapy","000134","ONCB","Oncology B ","","","08","","","",""

Studies have suggested roles for SIRT7 in heart disease, inflammatory processes, metabolism, and various tumors, including breast, thyroid, and blood cancers. Despite the importance of SIRT7 in such disease processes, relatively little is understood about its molecular mechanisms of action. The proposed research will investigate the molecular mechanisms of SIRT7 action in aging-, cancer-, and other disease-associated cellular programs.

Therefore, there is an urgent need for better understanding of the resistance mechanisms and to identify markers and therapeutic targets for personalized treatment and improving survival.

It is a prototypic chronic inflammatory disease that affects women and minorities, growing in numbers in the Veteran population, disproportionately. It serves as a model for other chronic inflammatory diseases that affect Veterans, such as atherosclerosis (heart disease), hypertension, and diabetic kidney disease. Endothelial cells lining blood vessels in lupus become activated by lupus serum. This in turn leads to recruitment of activated inflammatory cells into tissues such as the kidney. This project is designed to determine why lupus serum activates these lining cells to recruit inflammatory cells. The results of this study could lead to safer and more targeted therapy for chronic inflammatory diseases such as lupus kidney disease and heart disease, non-lupus heart disease, and diabetic kidney disease.","1890615; ","OATES, JAMES C;","","07/01/2016","06/30/2019","Acute; Address; Adhesions; Affect; African American; Antigen-Antibody Complex; Atherosclerosis; Autoantibodies; base; Binding; Biological Assay; Blood Vessels; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cell Adhesion Molecules; Cell Communication; Cell physiology; Cells; Chronic; chronic autoimmune disease; Chronic Kidney Failure; Coupling; Cultured Cells; Deposition; design; Development; diabetic; Diabetic Nephropathy; differential expression; dimer; Dimerization; Disease; Distal; drug development; effective therapy; Employee Strikes; Endothelial Cells; endothelial dysfunction; exosome; Functional disorder; Genes; Glycosphingolipids; Goals; Heart Diseases; Heterogeneity; Hypertension; hypertensive heart disease; Immune; Immune response; Immune system; Immunoglobulin G; Immunoglobulins; Individual; Infection; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Inflammatory Infiltrate; Inflammatory Response; Interferon-alpha; ITGAM gene; Kidney; Kidney Diseases; Kidney Failure; Knowledge; Laboratories; Lead; Lesion; Lipids; Liquid Chromatography; liquid chromatography mass spectrometry; Lupus; Lupus Nephritis; Mass Spectrum Analysis; Mediating; Metabolism; Methods; migration; Minority; Modeling; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Necrosis; neutrophil; Nitric Oxide; NOS3 gene; novel; Organ; Pathogenicity; Pathologic; Pathway Analysis; Pathway interactions; Patients; Peptide Mapping; pharmacodynamic biomarker; Phenotype; Phosphorylation; Physiological; Population; Post-Translational Protein Processing; prevent; Process; Production; protein expression; Proteins; public health relevance; Recruitment Activity; response; Role; Sampling; Serum; Serum Proteins; Signal Transduction; standard of care; Superoxides; Systemic Lupus Erythematosus; targeted agent; targeted treatment; Testing; therapy development; Threonine; Time; Tissues; Urine; Validation; Vascular Diseases; Vascular Endothelial Cell; Veterans; Woman; ","Targeting Pathogenic Endothelial Dysfunction in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus","001248","IMMA","Immunology A ","","","02","","","",""

Basic and translational research on PKD has increased exponentially in the last three decades, particularly after the discovery of the PKD1 and PKD2 genes in 1994 and 1996. Nevertheless, no proven effective therapy exists for this disease at the present time. The mission of the Mayo Translational PKD Center (MTPC) is to foster PKD research and the translation of basic research breakthroughs into improvements in clinical practice with the ultimate goal to reduce or eliminate the disease burden of PKD. Therefore, the leadership of the center chose three Biomedical Research Cores after thoughtful analysis of the services that would be most effective in achieving this goal. The Molecular Genetics and Biomarker Core uses genetic approaches to advance the understanding of disease pathogenesis and characterizes PKD populations to facilitate clinical trials. The Model Systems Core empowers PKD research through access to PKD C. elegans, zebrafish and rodent models, their biological characterization, and their use in identifying new therapeutics. The Human Imaging Core provides accurate, reliable analysis of imaging data and develops enhanced methodologies to facilitate the assessment of disease progression and the outcome of therapies in ADPKD. The Pilot and Feasibility Program attracts new investigators to PKD research, helps them to launch novel PKD focused projects, thus sustaining and expanding the Center Membership. The research capacity of the MTPC is enhanced by a vigorous Scientific Enrichment Program that promotes synergy among its members and and by partnering with Institutional Facilities and other Mayo and non-Mayo NIH funded Centers. In the first four years of their existence, the three MTPC Biomedical Research Cores have provided services to many PKD investigators and made important conceptual and technological advances. Research conducted by MTPC investigators has already led to clinical trials with encouraging results.","1877235; ","TORRES, VICENTE E;","MOXEY-MIMS, MARVA M.","10/01/2010","06/30/2020","Advisory Committees; Affect; Applications Grants; Area; Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney; base; Basic Science; biobank; bioimaging; Biological; Biological Markers; Biological Models; Biomedical Research; Budgets; burden of illness; Caenorhabditis elegans; career development; Clinical; clinical practice; Clinical Sciences; Clinical Trials; Communication; Communities; comparative; Complement; Comprehensive Cancer Center; Core Facility; cost; Data; Data Analyses; Databases; Development; Disease; disease mechanisms study; Disease Progression; Doctor of Philosophy; effective therapy; experience; Feedback; Fostering; Funding; Gastroenterology; gene discovery; Generations; Genes; Genetic; genetic approach; Genome; Genotype; Goals; Grant; human imaging; Image; Image Analysis; imaging genetics; imaging informatics; improved; Individual; individualized medicine; Industry; innovation; instrument; interest; International; Investments; Kidney Diseases; knockout gene; Laboratory Research; Leadership; Measures; Medical; Medical Imaging; Medicine; member; metabolomics resource; Methodology; Mission; Modeling; Molecular Genetics; molecular marker; Monitor; Mutation; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases; novel; novel therapeutics; Office of Administrative Management; operation; Organism; Outcome; Pathogenesis; Pathogenicity; patient oriented; Patients; Personnel Management; Phenotype; PKD1 gene; PKD2 gene; Polycystic Kidney Diseases; Population; Positioning Attribute; programs; Proteins; Proteomics; public health relevance; Renal Replacement Therapy; repository; Research; Research Personnel; Research Project Grants; Resources; response; Retreatment; Rodent; Rodent Model; Services; Signal Transduction; student training; success; Surveys; synergism; Technology; Testing; therapy outcome; Time; tool; Training; Training Programs; Transgenic Organisms; Translational Research; Translations; United States National Institutes of Health; Update; Urine; Variant; Zebrafish; ","Mayo Translational PKD Center (MTPC)","090728","ZDK1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","08","727896","429458","1157354",""

To reach these goals, we utilize two animal models, mice and zebrafish, that have been extremely useful in studies of normal blood cells and human disease, and also employ iPS cell reprogramming to create human disease models ?in the dish? with recent CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. In addition, the CHSCC focuses on training new investigators, distributing important reagents and animals to other laboratories, and on distributing new knowledge to the entire community of blood researchers.

Professional American women & those  from all developed nations increasingly delay childbearing for several years compared to the past  because of career advancement and increasing social acceptability. This problem is not solely a  woman?s health issue but equally affects men as only 40% of infertility is attributable solely to  women, while an estimated equal 40% is attributable to the male partner who also contributes to  another 20% of combined female & male causes.  Currently, recombinant (r) human (h) follicle stimulating hormone (rhFSH) is the single largest  therapeutic component of the infertility market with sales considerably in excess of $1 billion per  year, of which 40-50% of that total or over $500 Million per year in the much higher priced and  growing US market.  Trophogen has recently designed a new long acting and more effective FSH analog for cattle and  other livestock reproduction which is already licensed to Zoetis (formerly Pfizer Animal Health and  the world?s largest animal pharma) which has performed extensive ?due diligence? confirming the  safety & all aspects of the superiority of this analog.  This new bovine FSH analog has recently inspired the analogous design by the principal  investigators/inventors at Trophogen of a similar long-acting, requiring many fewer injections,  much more potent and effective, hFSH for infertility showing similar great superiority to all  current FSH products.  With its very low production costs for this much more potent drug, and its vastly smaller overhead  costs than big pharma, Trophogen is confident it will still be highly profitable, pricing its  vastly superior new FSH analog in the US well below that of both currently branded FSH as well as  coming generics called ?biosimilars? which will quickly assume a dominant FSH market position in  the US and globally.  The advanced development of this vastly superior FSH analog for infertility on a low cost, fast  track FDA pathway for superior biotech drugs using novel internet marketing will make rhFSH  treatment for infertility and many other growing markets, for the first time, much more effective  and affordable for U.S. and women throughout the world!","6491949; 8377710 (contact); ","SZKUDLINSKI, MARIUSZ W; WEINTRAUB, BRUCE DALE (contact);","EISENBERG, ESTHER ","08/22/2017","02/21/2018","Advanced Development; Affect; American; Amino Acids; analog; Animals; Antral; attenuation; base; Bioreactors; Biotechnology; Carbohydrates; Career Mobility; Cattle; cell bank; Chinese Hamster Ovary Cell; Chromosome abnormality; Clinical Pathways; Clinical Trials; Code; Collaborations; Complex; cost; cost effective; Couples; Data; Delayed Childbearing; design; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Development; Disease; disorder prevention; Drug Kinetics; Drug usage; egg; Embryo; Emotional; Epigenetic Process; Ethics; European; Female; Fertilization in Vitro; Financial cost; Follicle Stimulating Hormone; Future; Generations; Generic Drugs; Genetic; Glycoproteins; good laboratory practice; Health; hormone analog; Hormones; Human; Human Follicle Stimulating Hormone; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; in vivo Bioassay; Infertility; infertility treatment; Injection of therapeutic agent; Institutes; Insurance; Internet; intrauterine insemination; Isoleucine; Lead; Legal patent; Link; Livestock; male; Marketing; Medical; men; Mendelian disorder; Metabolic; metabolomics; Methods; Mutagenesis; N-terminal; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development; New Drug Approvals; novel; Oocytes; Ovarian Stimulations; Pathway interactions; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacodynamics; Phase; Positioning Attribute; Pregnancy; Preparation; Price; Principal Investigator; Production; programs; Publications; receptor; receptor binding; Recombinants; Regulatory Pathway; Reporting; Reproduction; reproductive; research study; Resources; response; Roller Bottle; Safety; Sales; scale up; screening; sex; Side; social; Specificity; Statistical Data Interpretation; Superovulation; Techniques; Testing; Therapeutic; Time; Toxicology; Uterus; Valine; Viral; Weight; whole genome; Woman; Women's Health; ","Development of Novel and Affordable Neoglycosylated, Long Acting Superactive Analog of Human FSH for Infertility","090804","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","01","","","299999",""

Therefore, there is a vital need to develop more clinically effective assessments, such as the one studied in this project, for accurately identifying, and treating, those at risk of developing chronic WAD to reduce the societal and personal burden of this debilitating condition.","10074185; ","ELLIOTT, JAMES MATTHEW;","MARDEN, SUSAN F.","09/01/2014","05/31/2019","Accident and Emergency department; Adult; American; Ankle; Anxiety; base; Behavioral; Biological; Biological Factors; Biomechanics; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.); Cervical; Chronic; Clinical; cohort; Combined Modality Therapy; Complex; coping; cost; Data; Development; disability; Disease; Education; Electrophysiology (science); Emergency Medicine; Employee Strikes; Etiology; Evaluation; expectation; Fatty acid glycerol esters; Foundations; functional disability; Functional disorder; functional outcomes; Future; Goals; Health Care Costs; high risk; Hospitals; Image; improved; improved outcome; Individual; injured; Injury; Intervention; Knowledge; Leg; Lower Extremity; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Measures; Mediating; Medical; Mental Depression; Methods; Minority; Modeling; Motor; motor disorder; Motor Neurons; Motor Pathways; Motor Vehicles; Muscle; Muscle Fatigue; Muscle Weakness; Muscular Atrophy; Neck; Nerve Degeneration; Neural Pathways; neuromuscular; neurophysiology; novel; Outcome; Pain; Patient risk; Patients; persistent symptom; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacology; Physical therapy; Physiological; Play; Process; prognostic; prospective; psychologic; psychological distress; psychosocial; Psychosocial Factor; public health relevance; Quality of life; Radiology Specialty; Recovery; Recovery of Function; Regimen; rehabilitative care; relating to nervous system; Research; Risk; Role; Science; Scientific Inquiry; Sensory; Signs and Symptoms; Skeletal muscle structure of neck; social; Spinal; Spinal Cord; Spinal cord injury; spinal pathway; Study Subject; Testing; Time; treatment strategy; United States; Ursidae Family; vehicular accident; Volition; Whiplash Injuries; Work; ","Neuromuscular Mechanisms Underlying Poor Recovery from Whiplash Injuries","079076","MRS","Musculoskeletal Rehabilitation Sciences Study Section ","","","04","211600","104466","316066",""

Because dietary fatty acids have been linked to abnormal blood vessel function and insulin resistance (a prelude to type 2 diabetes), dietary fatty acid manipulation may be an important target for preventing or reversing the vascular disease associated with obesity so prevalent in the VA population. The focus of this proposal is to address the mechanisms underlying dietary fatty acid-induced vascular dysfunction which we hypothesize is related to abnormal fat content of the blood vessel wall. Membrane fats may affect the association of proteins or the production of lipid based signaling pathways within the artery wall that modulate their function. In an animal model we will examine effects of diets high in saturated (lard) versus unsaturated fats (fish and olive oils) on vascular responses as well as membrane fatty acid and sphingolipid content.","1916982; ","LAMPING, KATHRYN G;","","10/01/2009","03/31/2018","Address; Affect; Animal Model; Aorta; Arteries; base; Blood Pressure; Blood Vessels; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cardiovascular system; Caveolae; caveolin 1; Cell membrane; Data; diabetic; Diet; Dietary Fats; Dietary Fatty Acid; dihydroceramide desaturase; Event; Fat Substitutes; Fatty acid glycerol esters; Fatty Acids; feeding; Fish Oils; glucose tolerance; Goals; Guidelines; Healthcare; High Fat Diet; indexing; Individual; inhibitor/antagonist; innovation; Insulin Resistance; insulin signaling; lard; Link; Lipids; Measures; Mediating; Membrane; Membrane Lipids; Membrane Microdomains; Menhaden oil; Modeling; Mono-S; mouse model; Mus; Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; NOS3 gene; Obesity; Olive oil preparation; Overweight; Pharmacology; Phospholipids; polyunsaturated fat; Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids; Population; prevent; Production; Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase; Proteins; public health relevance; Research; response; saturated fat; Saturated Fatty Acids; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Signaling Molecule; Signaling Protein; Sphingolipids; sphingosine 1-phosphate; sphingosine kinase; Study models; Testing; therapeutic target; Tissues; Unsaturated Fats; vascular abnormality; Vascular Diseases; Veterans; ","Effect of dietary fat on diet-induced insulin resistance and vascular dysfunction","000543","CARA","Cardiovascular Studies A ","","","08","","","",""

Following accidental injury or surgical trauma, patients in intensive care units often have high blood glucose levels, as well as high insulin levels, a symptom similar to the insulin resistance of Type 2 diabetes, even with no pre-existing symptoms of diabetes. However, little is known as to the basic reasons for this insulin resistance and the mechanisms of recovery. Skeletal muscle plays a central role in whole-body glucose metabolism.

This is of particular relevance to Veterans of the U.S. Military in whom the prevalence of allergic rhinitis is approximately 30% and allergic asthma is approximately 6%. Thus, allergic diseases are an important cause of morbidity among Veterans. Very recently, Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) were discovered in both in mice and in people. ILC2 produces large quantities of specific proteins called cytokines that are important in the development of allergic inflammation. Our preliminary data suggests that a medication that is currently being used for the treatment of patients with pulmonary hypertension, prostaglandin (PG)I2, may be an important inhibitor of the inflammatory function of ILC2. Our proposal will define the mechanisms by which PGI2 blocks the initial phases of allergic airway inflammation and may be a novel and effective treatment for asthma.","1903042; ","PEEBLES, RAY STOKES;","","10/01/2009","06/30/2018","adaptive immune response; airborne allergen; airway inflammation; Allergens; Allergic; allergic airway inflammation; Allergic Disease; Allergic inflammation; Allergic rhinitis; Alternaria; analog; Animals; antigen challenge; Arachidonic Acids; Asthma; Bone Marrow; Breathing; Cell Count; Cell physiology; Cell Proliferation; Cell secretion; cell type; Cells; Chronic Disease; clinical application; clinically relevant; clinically significant; cytokine; Data; Dendritic Cells; Development; effective therapy; Enzymes; Eosinophilia; Epithelial Cells; Epoprostenol; experimental study; Extrinsic asthma; FDA approved; Fungal Antigens; Genes; Genetic Polymorphism; Hour; Human; human disease; Hypersensitivity skin testing; hypertension control; Immediate hypersensitivity; Immune response; In Vitro; in vivo; Inflammatory; Inflammatory Response; inhibitor/antagonist; Innate Immune Response; Interleukin-10; Interleukin-13; Interleukin-5; intraperitoneal; Lead; Link; Lung; Lung diseases; Lymphoid Cell; Metabolic; Metabolism; microbial; Military Personnel; Modeling; Molecular; Morbidity - disease rate; Mucous body substance; Mus; novel; overexpression; Pathway interactions; Patients; Peptide Hydrolases; peripheral blood; Persons; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase; Phenotype; Prevalence; Production; Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase; protein expression; Proteins; Public Health; public health relevance; Publishing; Pulmonary Hypertension; Reaction; reagent testing; receptor; response; Role; Signal Transduction; Testing; Therapeutic Uses; Time; United States; Veterans; ","PGI2 inhibition of pulmonary innate allergic immune responses","000624","PULM","Respiration ","","","08","","","",""

In veteran patients, obesity is even more prevalent with over 75% of patients overweight or obese. However, treatment options for obesity are very limited.  In this project we propose a new method for the treatment of obesity. In this method, a pair of tiny wires is placed on the surface of the small bowel and weak electrical current is delivered to the small bowel via these wires. Such a weak electrical current makes the emptying of the stomach slower so that a patient will not feel hungry so quickly and also makes the movement of ingested food through the small bowel more quickly so that fewer nutrients are absorbed by the body.","1885065; ","CHEN, JIANDE ;","","04/01/2014","03/31/2018","absorption; Acceleration; Adverse effects; Algorithms; bariatric surgery; base; Body Weight; Body Weight decreased; Brain; Cessation of life; Chronic; clinical application; Comorbidity; cost; Data; design; Desire for food; Detection; Diet; Eating; Electric Stimulation; Epidemic; experimental study; Food; food surveillance; Gastric Emptying; Gastrointestinal Hormones; Gastrointestinal Motility; ghrelin; glucagon-like peptide 1; Goals; Human; hypocretin; Hypothalamic structure; improved; Ingestion; Intestinal Absorption; Intestines; Laboratory Research; Lead; Long-Term Effects; Malnutrition; Measures; Melanocyte stimulating hormone; Metabolism; Methodology; Methods; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Movement; Neurons; neuropeptide Y; novel therapeutics; Nutrient; nutrient absorption; Obesity; obesity treatment; Overweight; Oxytocin; Pain; Patients; peptide hormone; Peptides; Peripheral; Physiological; Prevalence; public health relevance; Rattus; reduced food intake; response; Risk; Rodent Model; Safety; Satiation; satiety center; Series; Signal Transduction; Small Intestines; Speed; statistics; Stomach; Stress; Surface; System; Technology; Therapeutic; Treatment Protocols; Veterans; ","Synchronized Intestinal Electrical Stimulation for Obesity","002010","GAST","Gastroenterology ","","","04","","","",""

The development of new therapeutic strategies that overcome these limitations would greatly improve the quality of life among Veterans with SCI.

Currently, there is no treatment for DM-related cognitive decline. Recently, intranasal insulin (INI) therapy has emerged as a potential new solution to deliver insulin safely to the brain and treat DM-related cognitive impairment. Our pilot study showed that a single INI dose improved specific cognitive domains in type 2 DM adults and healthy control. These results strongly support long-term INI therapy as a strategy to preserve cognitive function in older diabetic adults. This study will determine prospectively whether INI therapy improves cognition, gait and functionality in older diabetic adults that may prevent functional decline and translate into a better self-care in this vulnerable population. If successful, this study may have high impact on treatment of the large population of aged people with type 2 DM, and may provide a novel therapeutic target for treatment of cognitive and functional impairment in older diabetic adults.","6108770; ","NOVAK, VERA ;","STOECKEL, LUKE ","07/01/2015","05/31/2020","Activities of Daily Living; Adult; Adverse event; Affect; Aftercare; Age-associated memory impairment; aged; aging brain; Alzheimer's Disease; apolipoprotein E-4; Attention; base; Binding; blood oxygen level dependent; Body Weight; Brain; Cardiovascular system; Categories; Characteristics; clinical phenotype; clinical predictors; clinically relevant; Cognition; Cognitive; cognitive function; cognitive testing; Control Groups; Dementia; Dependence; diabetes control; Diabetes Mellitus; diabetic; Dose; Double-Blind Method; efficacy study; Elderly; Energy Metabolism; fasting glucose; follow-up; Frequencies; functional decline; functional disability; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Future; Gait; Gait speed; Genetic; Genetic Markers; glucose monitor; glycemic control; Health; Hippocampus (Brain); Hypoglycemia; Hypothalamic structure; Impaired cognition; improved; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Intervention; Intranasal Administration; Learning; Limbic System; Long-Term Effects; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Measurement; Measures; Memory; Mental Depression; neuroprotection; neurotrophic factor; neurovascular; neurovascular coupling; new therapeutic target; non-diabetic; Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; normal aging; Outcome; Patients; Performance; Perfusion; Phenotype; Pilot Projects; Placebo Control; placebo controlled study; Placebos; Population; prevent; primary outcome; prospective; public health relevance; Randomized; Randomized Controlled Trials; receptor; Regional Perfusion; Regulation; response; Rest; Risk; Safety; Saline; Self Care; Serious Adverse Event; Spin Labels; Sterility; subcutaneous; Time; Translating; Vasodilation; Verbal Learning; Visuospatial; Vulnerable Populations; Walking; Weight Gain; Work; ","Memory Advancement by Intranasal Insulin in Type 2 Diabetes (MemAID)","103902","CIDO","Clinical and Integrative Diabetes and Obesity Study Section ","","","03","483793","250344","734137",""

This meeting provides this venue and has been in existence since 1949. Seafood safety continues to be relevant today and a key issue to regulators and consumers. The ISS is a seminar that has its focus on the seafood industry in the United States. From harvest to consumer, from ocean bound states to inland states, all topics are discussed. Attendees include - government regulators, academia, industry, and anyone who regulates, distributes, sells, produces or processes seafood in the United States. In this ever growing industry, there is an overabundance of regulations to assure consumers that seafood is safe to eat. Attendees will continue to be informed on the foremost issues related to new and innovative technology, Country of Origin Labeling requirements, pathogens of concern, seafood at retail initiatives, updates on new regulations, FDA initiatives and more.

These drugs are essential for the treatment of rheumatologic diseases, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, and to prevent rejection of organ transplants. Furthermore, glucocorticoids are also prescribed for veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder. However, the adverse skeletal effects of glucocorticoids are a substantial drawback to the use of these drugs.

Recent evidence has pointed to enteroendocrine cells - sensory cells of the gut - as potential solutions. These cells secrete neuropeptides [e.g., cholecystokinin (CCK) and peptide YY (PYY)] that are potent inducers of satiety, and their sensory mechanisms have been the subject of intensive investigation. However, how these cells communicate with other cells is largely unknown. We recently discovered that CCK and PYY cells have unique cellular processes that extend to neurons in the gut. We believe these processes allow enteroendocrine cells to communicate with neurons through direct cell-to-cell synaptic connections. We anticipate that characterization of gut neuroendocrine signaling will facilitate the development of strategies to regulate food intake and ultimately provide novel approaches to treat obesity.","1877307; ","LIDDLE, RODGER A.;","","04/01/2014","03/31/2018","3-Dimensional; Affect; Afferent Neurons; Anatomy; Axon; Body Weight; Cell physiology; Cells; cellular transduction; Cholecystokinin; Coculture Techniques; Communication; Cost of Illness; Data; Dendrites; design; Desire for food; Development; Diet; Eating; Electron Microscopy; enhanced green fluorescent protein; Enteral; Enteroendocrine Cell; Fatty acid glycerol esters; Fiber; Food; Food Intake Regulation; gastrointestinal epithelium; Genetic Transcription; glucagon-like peptide 1; Growth; Hormones; In Vitro; in vivo; innovation; Investigation; Laboratories; Methods; Modeling; Molecular; mouse model; Mucous Membrane; Nerve Growth Factors; Neuroendocrine Cell; Neuroglia; neuronal circuitry; Neurons; Neuropeptides; Neurosecretory Systems; neurotrophic factor; novel; novel strategies; novel therapeutic intervention; Nutrient; Obese Mice; Obesity; Optics; Patients; Peptide YY; Peptides; Peripheral; Process; public health relevance; Satiation; sensor; Sensory; sensory mechanism; Signal Transduction; Synapses; Testing; Therapeutic; tool; Transgenic Mice; transmission process; Treatment Efficacy; ","Gut Neuroendocrine Cell Signaling and Obesity","002230","GAST","Gastroenterology ","","","04","","","",""

GRB7 amplification and over-expression contribute to the aggressive behaviors of breast cancer. Study of GRB7 signaling will reveal why breast cancer with GRB7 over-expression is a more aggressive disease and lead to development of novel targeted therapy. GRB7 amplification and over- expression has been described in 20-25% of gastro-esophageal (GE) junction cancer. Though of lower incidence, GE junction cancer is a much more lethal disease than colon or prostate cancer and its incidence is rapidly climbing.

Currently there are no FDA-approved treatments for alcoholic liver disease. Liver transplantation is the only curative approach; and is only available for a small proportion of patients. Thus there is an urgent need to better understand the pathogenesis of inflammation and fibrosis in this disease and to develop rational treatment approaches. This proposal is aimed at elucidating the role of NOX4-mediated oxidative stress in promoting TNFalpha production, inflammation and fibrosis. Based on the data generated we propose to use a novel NOX4 inhibitor as a new treatment strategy to halt disease progression in ALD.","7941244; ","TOROK, NATALIE J.;","","07/01/2014","12/31/2018","Acetaldehyde; Acute; Address; Affect; Alcoholic Liver Diseases; Animal Model; Apoptosis; apoptosis inducing factor; Apoptotic; Area; Attenuated; base; Biological Assay; Biosensor; Cell Death; Cell Nucleus; Cells; Ceramides; Cessation of life; Chromatin; Chronic; chronic liver disease; Cirrhosis; Coculture Techniques; Collagen; Complement; Complex; CYP2E1 gene; Data; Deoxyribonucleases; Development; Disease; Disease Progression; DNase-I Footprinting; Down-Regulation; effective therapy; Enzymes; Event; experimental study; Extracellular Matrix; FDA approved; Fibrosis; Future; Genetic Transcription; Hepatic Stellate Cell; Hepatocyte; Human; Hydrogen Peroxide; in vivo; Inflammation; Inflammatory; inhibitor/antagonist; Injury; Ligands; Lipid Peroxidation; Lipid Peroxides; liver injury; liver transplantation; Mediating; Membrane Microdomains; Mitochondria; Modeling; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Mus; mutant; Myofibroblast; NADPH Oxidase; novel; Oral; Oxidative Stress; paracrine; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Patients; Play; problem drinker; Production; promoter; public health relevance; Recruitment Activity; Regulation; Role; Signal Transduction; Source; Steatohepatitis; System; Testing; Time; TIMP3 gene; TNF gene; TNF-alpha converting enzyme; transcription factor; treatment strategy; United States Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans; Work; Xanthine Oxidase; ","The Role of TNF alpha Converting Enzyme in Alcoholic Liver Disease","002418","GAST","Gastroenterology ","","","04","","","",""

Further, the prevalence of RA is much higher in women than in men. This is of special relevance to women serving in the military. The aging Veterans constitute another group to bear the brunt of RA. The suffering and disabilities caused by RA impose a huge financial burden on the healthcare and rehabilitation of Veterans. Many potent drugs are available for the treatment of RA, but their prolonged use is associated with severe adverse reactions. The goal of our study is to develop a novel method of drug delivery primarily into swollen (inflamed) joints, thereby sparing other organs from unwanted drug toxicity. We recently identified small peptides, which when injected into the bloodstream, preferentially home to the inflamed joints. We will study the effects of these peptides on cells of the inner lining (endothelium) of blood vessels of the joints, and use these peptides to direct drug-carrying vesicles (liposomes) from the bloodstream into the joints.","1969359; ","MOUDGIL, KAMAL D;","","04/01/2015","03/31/2019","Address; Adjuvant Arthritis; Adverse effects; Adverse reactions; Affect; Aging; alanine aminopeptidase; American; Aminopeptidase P; antiarthritic agent; Antibodies; Antigen Targeting; Arginine; Arthritis; arthropathies; Aspartic Acid; Attenuated; Autoantigens; autoimmune arthritis; Autoimmune Process; Autoimmune Responses; Autoimmunity; Bacteriophages; base; Binding; Blood Circulation; Blood Vessels; bone; cell motility; Cells; Characteristics; Chronic; Code; Collaborations; combat; Comparative Study; Cyclic Peptides; design; Detection; Development; disability; Disease; Drug Delivery Systems; Drug Targeting; Drug toxicity; Encapsulated; Endothelial Cells; Endothelium; Event; experience; Experimental Models; Gene Expression Profile; Glucosephosphate Isomerase; Glycine; Goals; Health; Health Care Costs; Healthcare; Heat shock proteins; Heterogeneity; Home environment; Homing; Human; Immunity; In Vitro; in vivo; Individual; Inflammation; Inflammation Mediators; Injectable; innovation; insight; Institutes; Integrins; Intra-Articular Injections; joint injury; Joints; Knowledge; Leukocytes; Ligand Binding; Liposomes; Mediator of activation protein; Medical Research; men; Methodology; Methods; migration; Military Personnel; Modeling; Molecular; molecular marker; neoplastic cell; new therapeutic target; novel; novel therapeutic intervention; Organ; Organ Specificity; Pain; Pathogenesis; Pathogenicity; Pathologic; Peptide Phage Display Library; Peptides; Phage Display; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Poisons; Polyethylene Glycols; Population; Prevalence; Process; Proteins; public health relevance; Publishing; Quality of life; Rat-1; Rattus; receptor binding; Receptor Cell; Rehabilitation therapy; Reporting; Research Institute; Research Personnel; Reticuloendothelial System; RGD (sequence); Rheumatoid Arthritis; Series; Signal Transduction; Stress; Surface; Synovitis; System; systemic autoimmune disease; systemic toxicity; T-Lymphocyte; targeted delivery; Therapeutic Agents; Therapeutic Effect; Therapeutic Index; Therapeutic Uses; Time; Tissues; treatment strategy; tumor; uptake; Vascular Endothelial Cell; Vascular Endothelium; Vesicle; Veterans; Wit; Woman; Work; ","Anti-arthritic activity and therapeutic use of novel joint-homing peptides","002424","IMMA","Immunology A ","","","03","","","",""

Moreover, HF is the leading and most expensive cause of hospitalization in the VA system, and the mortality rate remains unacceptably high (5-year survival of ~50%), indicating the urgent need for better therapies. In this project, we will test in mice a new therapeutic approach in HF that targets a specialized immune cell population termed regulatory T-cells, in an effort to alleviate the inflammation and heart damage characteristic of this disease. This approach has never been previously tested, but is highly promising based on our preliminary work, and may have considerable clinical implications for HF patients.","1914941; ","PRABHU, SUMANTH D;","","07/01/2015","06/30/2019","Ablation; Adoptive Transfer; Adult; Age-Years; American; American Heart Association; angiogenesis; Anti-inflammatory; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Antigen Presentation; Antigen-Presenting Cells; Antigens; Apoptosis; base; Biological Assay; Blood; Blood capillaries; Blood Circulation; Bone Marrow; Bromodeoxyuridine; C57BL/6 Mouse; capillary; Cardiac; CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; CD8B1 gene; cell type; Cells; cellular targeting; Characteristics; Chronic; Clinical; clinical practice; Clinical Trials; Congestive Heart Failure; Coronary; cytokine; Data; Dendritic Cells; density; Diffuse; Diphtheria Toxin; diphtheria toxin receptor; Disease; Disease Progression; Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution; Economic Burden; EFRAC; Elderly; Endothelial Cells; Exhibits; Fibrosis; Flow Cytometry; Functional disorder; Heart; Heart Diseases; Heart failure; Heart Hypertrophy; Home environment; Hospitalization; Human; Immune; Immunohistochemistry; immunoregulation; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; Incidence; indexing; Infarction; Inflammation; Inflammation Mediators; Inflammatory; Injury; innovation; Interferon-alpha; Knowledge; Label; Left; Left Ventricular Remodeling; Leukocytes; Lifetime Risk; Ligation; Long-Term Effects; lymph nodes; macrophage; Measures; Mediastinal lymph node group; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; men; Mononuclear; mortality; Mus; Myocardial; Myocardial Ischemia; Myocarditis; neovascularization; novel; novel strategies; novel therapeutic intervention; Nuclear; outcome forecast; p65; Pathologic; Patients; Population; promoter; Proteins; PTPRC gene; public health relevance; receptor; Receptor Signaling; reconstitution; Regulatory T-Lymphocyte; repository; response; Role; Signal Transduction; Spleen; Splenocyte; statistics; Stem cells; stroke; System; Systolic heart failure; T-Cell Activation; T-Lymphocyte; T-Lymphocyte Subsets; Testing; Therapeutic; Time; Tissues; TNF gene; TNFRSF1A gene; TNFRSF1B gene; trafficking; Transcription Factor 3; Transgenic Mice; Translating; Tube; Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor; Update; Ventricular; Veterans; Woman; Work; ","Role of Regulatory T-Lymphocytes in Chronic Heart Failure","002706","CARA","Cardiovascular Studies A ","","","03","","","",""

Although RNA processing and decay mechanisms have long been thought to be primarily salvage pathways, new data clearly indicate that these pathways play very important roles in gene expression and are critical aspects of the bacteria?s ability to adapt to changes in its environment. For example, work in our laboratory during the past grant developed discovered that polyadenylation helps regulate functional tRNA levels in the bacterium and can interfere with protein synthesis. We have also found very strong evidence that there is another endoribonuclease in the bacterium that has not yet been characterized and is involved in rRNA maturation. We believe that there are still important gaps in our understanding of post-transcriptional RNA metabolism. The experiments described in this application will provide new insights into the initiation of mRNA decay, tRNA processing, and rRNA maturation in E. coli.","1859383 (contact); 10441632; ","KUSHNER, SIDNEY R.

We found that treating a pancreatic cancer cells with chemotherapy induces the expression of specific proteins that causes cancer cells to be less responsive to chemotherapy and increases their ability to spread. Further studies in our laboratory show that one of the proteins called CD44s enables pancreatic cancer to become more resistant to therapy as well as more aggressive following chemotherapy. It is central tenet of this study is to block the expression and or function of CD44 as a means to improve therapy for pancreatic cancer. A prerequisite for this is to gain a better understanding of the functional role of this protein, to better understand what causes chemotherapy to induce the expression of CD44 and to determine whether blocking the expression and/or function of CD44 will prevent spread of the cancer and will improve response to chemotherapy.","1897559; ","FREEMAN, JAMES W.;","","04/01/2015","03/31/2019","Address; Adenocarcinoma Cell; Adverse effects; Antibodies; base; Biological Markers; Biology; cancer cell; Cancer Cell Growth; Cancer Etiology; Cancer stem cell; CD44 Antigens; CD44 gene; Cell Line; Cells; chemotherapy; Data; Down-Regulation; Engraftment; Environment; Epithelial; epithelial to mesenchymal transition; Excision; Exons; Flow Cytometry; gemcitabine; Gene Expression; Genetic Transcription; Growth; Homing; Hyaluronan; Hypoxia; Immunoglobulin Class Switching; improved; in vivo; insight; Integral Membrane Protein; Kinetics; knock-down; Knowledge; Laboratories; Lead; Link; malignant breast neoplasm; Malignant neoplasm of pancreas; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; Micrometastasis; migration; Modeling; Molecular; mouse model; Neoplasm Metastasis; neoplastic cell; outcome forecast; pancreatic cancer cells; Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma; Patients; Phenotype; phrases; Play; Population; prevent; Process; Property; Protein Isoforms; Proteins; Proteoglycan; public health relevance; Reporting; Research; Resistance; Resistance development; response; RNA Splicing; Role; Signal Transduction; Site; small hairpin RNA; Snails; Stem cells; Stress; Stromal Cells; Switch Genes; Testing; therapy resistant; Transcription Repressor/Corepressor; Treatment Efficacy; tumor; tumor progression; Variant; ","Role of CD44 in adaptive plasticity of pancreatic cancer","002962","ONCC","Oncology C ","","","03","","","",""

The warning attacks, called angina, indicate that the heart is transiently stressed by increased work load demands, by spasm or fluctuating thrombosis in one of the arteries prior to its complete closure. These periods of increased demand or of decreased blood flow stimulate the heart to adapt favorably to a more prolonged episode of oxygen deprivation. This concept, referred to as the 'smart heart,' relies on alterations in the energy producing parts of the heart cells, the mitochondria. We propose that mitochondria in chronically ischemic heart cells have acquired protection against low blood flow. By performing a surgical operation to resupply blood to the heart and supplementing with coenzyme Q10, our research will test the reversibility of reversibility of these adaptations.","1913011; ","MCFALLS, EDWARD O.;","","04/01/2010","06/30/2018","aldehyde dehydrogenases; Aldehydes; Animal Model; Anterior; Antioxidants; Apoptosis; Arteries; Biochemical Markers; Bioenergetics; Blood; Blood flow; Bypass; Cardiac; Chest Pain; Chronic; Clinical; Coenzyme Q10; Complex; Computers; Coronary Arteriosclerosis; Coronary Artery Bypass; deprivation; detector; efficacy testing; EFRAC; Electron Transport; Electrons; experience; Family suidae; Global Change; glutathione peroxidase; Heart; heart cell; Heart failure; Hibernation; hypoperfusion; improved; Individual; Infarction; Injury; internal thoracic artery; Intervention; Ischemia; Left; Lipids; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Metabolism; Methods; Mitochondria; Modeling; Morphology; Myocardial; Myocardial Infarction; Myocardial Ischemia; Myocardium; Necrosis; novel; operation; Operative Surgical Procedures; Outcome; oxidant stress; Oxidants; Oxidative Stress; Oxygen; Oxygen Consumption; Patients; Perfusion; Pharmacology; Physiological; predictive marker; Process; protein expression; protein transport; Proteins; Proteome; Proteomics; public health relevance; Pump; Recovery; Recovery of Function; Regional Blood Flow; Reperfusion Therapy; Reproducibility; Research; Respiration; response; Risk; Spasm; Stress; Study models; Sudden Death; Superoxide Dismutase; Supplementation; Techniques; Testing; Thrombosis; Time; Tissue Viability; Tissues; tomography; UCP2 protein; Work; Workload; ","Surgical Revascularization's Impact on Hibernating Myoacrdium","000760","SURG","Surgery ","","","07","","","",""

Our multidisciplinary research team at UCSF and in India has designed a new adherence-monitoring device called 'Tel-Me-Box' which is small, low-cost, rechargeable, inconspicuous, and could be programmed to deliver tailored real-time adherence reminders following additional hardware modifications. In this application, we propose to modify and validate this discreet Tel-Me-Box adherence monitoring and reminder device against hair ARV concentrations as a pharmacologic measure of drug ingestion/adherence, a measure pioneered and validated by our team, with the expectation that this device and intermittent hair monitoring could have widespread utility for HIV and non-HIV adherence science, both in India and globally.","14653986; 1908171 (contact); 1925065; ","CHANDY, SARA ; EKSTRAND, MARIA L.

Gut bacterial bile acid metabolism modulates gut motility through the enteric nervous system (ENS), but the mechanisms and pathways mediating these effects are unknown. Here I propose to elucidate (i) the extent to which gut bacterial bile acid metabolism regulates gut motility, and (ii) how the resulting bile acid milieu signals via the ENS to modulate gut motility, anticipating that these data will enable more efficacious deployment of gut microbiome-targeted therapies.","9311392; ","DEY, NEELENDU ;","SASLOWSKY, DAVID E","09/19/2016","08/31/2021","","The gut microbiota, bile acid-mediated enteric nervous system signaling, and modulation of gastrointestinal motility","111941","DDK","Kidney, Urologic and Hematologic Diseases D Subcommittee ","","","02","70300","5624","75924",""

There is convincing evidence that AD pathology starts several decades before the onset of symptoms, and discovery of biomarkers that represent asymptomatic stages of the disease will lead to early diagnosis and development of effective treatment and prevention strategies for the disease. Identifying asymptomatic at risk individuals during preclinical stages of AD will allow initiation of therapies that will either slo or, preferably, stop the progression of the disease. Research conducted at the Wisconsin ADRC has made seminal contributions to the field of biomarker research for AD, and has the potential to eventually find a cure for AD. This will have a great impact on patients and their families and will reduce the enormous societal costs associated with this devastating illness.","2201664; ","ASTHANA, SANJAY ;","SILVERBERG, NINA B.","05/01/2009","03/31/2019","Achievement; Adult; Adult Children; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease; Autopsy; Biochemical; Biological; Biological Markers; biomarker discovery; Blood; Blood Vessels; Brain; Caring; Chronic; Clinical; clinical Diagnosis; clinical phenotype; Clinical Trials Design; Cohort Studies; Collaborations; collaborative environment; Color; Comorbidity; Consultations; cost; Country; County; Data; Data Collection; data management; Data Set; Data Storage and Retrieval; Dementia; Development; Diagnosis; Disease; Disease Progression; DNA; DNA Repository; Doctor of Philosophy; Early Diagnosis; Education; effective therapy; Enrollment; Ensure; Environment; epigenomics; Etiology; Evaluation; Exercise; Extramural Activities; Family; Funding; General Population; Genetic; genetic risk factor; genome wide association study; Genomics; Genotype; Goals; Health Professional; healthy aging; Human; imaging biomarker; Individual; Informatics; innovation; Interdisciplinary Study; International; Leadership; Link; Medical; middle age; mild cognitive impairment; Minority; Minority Recruitment; Mission; Molecular; multidisciplinary; Neurobiology; neuroimaging; neuropathology; next generation; normal aging; novel; novel marker; Outcome; outreach; outreach program; Participant; Pathogenesis; Pathologic; Pathology; Patients; pediatric patients; Policy Maker; pre-clinical; Prevention strategy; Process; programs; Proteomics; public health relevance; Recording of previous events; Recruitment Activity; Regulation; relational database; Research; Research Personnel; research study; Resources; Risk; Risk Factors; Seminal; socioeconomics; Specimen; Standardization; success; Symptoms; Talents; targeted imaging; Techniques; Therapeutic; Time; Tissues; Training; Training Programs; Training Support; treatment strategy; Underrepresented Minority; United States National Institutes of Health; volunteer; web services; Wisconsin; Work; ","Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center","033514","ZAG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","S2","09","126991","40883","167874",""

For each of the 1 million people killed annually there are hundreds that are severely sickened by malaria. Indeed, malaria is one of the most frequent causes of sickness and death in the world today but especially in sub-Saharan Africa where its victims are primarily young children and pregnant women. And the situation is worsening due to the emergence of strains that harbor resistance to multiple drugs, including chloroquine. As a result there is an urgent need to develop a safe and effective replacement for chloroquine that is rapidly active and safe enough for use in children and pregnant women. The pharmachins have the potential to fulfill this need and to have a major impact on global health. The resultant advantages of avoiding drug toxicity, febrile illness and complex medical management during deployment are self-evident, as are the benefits to both short and long-term health of the US soldier.","1978072; ","RISCOE, MICHAEL KEVIN;","","04/01/2016","03/31/2021","3-Dimensional; 4-aminoquinoline; active method; Adverse effects; Africa South of the Sahara; Ames Assay; Amodiaquine; analog; Antimalarials; Area; Artemisinins; artesunate; Asia; Binding; Biological; Biological Availability; Cambodia; Cessation of life; Chemical Exposure; Child; Chloroquine; Chloroquine resistance; Clinical; clinically relevant; combat; Complex; design; Digit structure; Disclosure; Disease; Dose; Drug Kinetics; drug standard; Drug toxicity; Exhibits; Fever; genotoxicity; global health; Health; Human; In Vitro; in vitro activity; in vivo; Infection; invention; Killings; Lead; Legal patent; Libraries; Malaria; malaria infection; Manuscripts; Mediating; Medical; Medicine; Mefloquine; Metabolic; Methods; Modification; Multi-Drug Resistance; Mus; Neurologic; novel; novel therapeutics; Oral; Parasites; Periodicity; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacotherapy; Plasmodium; Plasmodium falciparum; Positioning Attribute; Pregnant Women; prevent; Prevention; Property; public health relevance; Publishing; Quinine; quinoline; Quinolones; Reaction Time; Readiness; Reporting; Research Activity; Resistance; resistant strain; Risk Assessment; Rodent; Rotation; Safety; scaffold; screening; Series; Side; Soldier; Stress; System; Testing; Therapeutic Intervention; Toxicant exposure; transmission process; Veterans; Work; ","Design and Optimization of Novel Antimalarial Drugs","003312","INFB","Infectious Diseases B ","","","02","","","",""

Stroke with heart attack are the 3rd leading cause of death and the leading cause of disability in the US, placing a great demand on VA to provide disability and long-term care. By focusing on understanding injury mechanisms that leads to mitochondrial and ultimately cellular bioenergetic failure, the research in this grant will promote the development of treatments with the ability to improve the long-term clinical outcome for stroke victims. Since cell death mechanisms triggered by ischemia are very similar to those causing brain damage due to traumatic brain injury, the new therapeutic approaches studied in this project will also have significant implication for treatment of TBI victims.","6804601; ","KRISTIAN, TIBOR ;","","04/01/2011","03/31/2020","Acute; Acute Brain Injuries; Address; Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose; adenylate kinase; Adverse effects; Affect; Age; Animal Model; Animals; Astrocytes; Bioenergetics; Brain; brain cell; Brain Injuries; Brain region; brain tissue; Catabolism; Cause of Death; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell Death; Cell Survival; cell type; Cellular Stress; Chronic; Clinical; clinical application; Consumption; Data; deprivation; disability; Disease; enzyme activity; Enzymes; Evaluation; Failure; Fluorescence; Generations; Genes; Genotoxic Stress; Glucose; Goals; Grant; Guanosine Triphosphate; Guanosine Triphosphate Phosphohydrolases; Heart Arrest; High Prevalence; Histologic; Impairment; improved; in vivo; inhibitor/antagonist; Injury; Inner mitochondrial membrane; Ischemia; Ischemic Brain Injury; knock-down; Lead; Link; Long-Term Care; Membrane Fusion; Metabolic; Metabolism; Mitochondria; mitochondrial dysfunction; mitochondrial metabolism; Morphology; morphometry; mouse model; Myocardial Infarction; NAD+ Nucleosidase; Nerve Degeneration; Neurodegenerative Disorders; Neurologic; Neurological outcome; Neurons; novel; novel therapeutic intervention; nucleotide metabolism; nudix hydrolase; Organelles; Outcome; overexpression; Oxidative Phosphorylation; Oxidative Stress; Oxygen; Pathologic; Play; Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases; Population; Process; Production; Prosencephalon; Protein Isoforms; Proteins; public health relevance; Recovery; Research; Resistance; Respiratory physiology; Risk Factors; RNA Interference; Role; stroke; Study Subject; TBI treatment; Techniques; Testing; Therapeutic; therapy development; Time; Transgenic Animals; Transgenic Mice; translational approach; Traumatic Brain Injury; Veterans; Work; ","Nudix hydrolases and mitochondrial dynamics in acute neurodegenerative disease","000917","NURC","Neurobiology C ","","","06","","","",""

Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most aggressive form of lung cancer and is strongly associated with recurrence after treatment, and short survival. We will capture and characterize SCLC heterogeneity by treating nave tumors and tumors after escaping chemotherapy. To identify cellular subpopulations, we will use powerful single cell mass cytometry, whole genome sequencing and RNA sequencing of cancer cells exposed to drug treatments. We will identify driver genetic alterations that are uniquely associated with tumor progression, including therapy-induced mutations and phenotypic alterations. We hope to uncover SCLC heterogeneity and its implications for therapy. This translational work offers considerable promise for the benefit of this group of Veterans. Ultimately, by personalizing SCLC management early in its course, we hope to provide patients with decrease pain and suffering and possibly a chance for a cure.","7362311; ","MASSION, PIERRE P.;","","04/01/2016","03/31/2020","actionable mutation; Aftercare; Automobile Driving; base; Behavior; Biological; Biological Assay; cancer cell; cancer heterogeneity; Cells; Cessation of life; chemotherapy; Clinical; Clinical Trials Design; Clonality; conventional therapy; Core Biopsy; Cytometry; Data; data integration; design; Diagnosis; Disease; drug sensitivity; EphA2 Receptor; Event; exceptional responders; Exhibits; Experimental Designs; Frequencies; Gene Amplification; Gene Expression; Gene Mutation; genome sequencing; Goals; Heterogeneity; High Prevalence; Human; improved; individual patient; individualized medicine; Induced Mutation; insight; Inter-tumoral heterogeneity; Intervention; kinase inhibitor; Lesion; lung small cell carcinoma; Malignant - descriptor; Malignant neoplasm of lung; Malignant Neoplasms; Mesenchymal; Molecular; molecular targeted therapies; mortality; Mutation; Nature; neuroendocrine phenotype; Neurosecretory Systems; new therapeutic target; Newly Diagnosed; novel marker; outcome forecast; Pain; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Patient-Focused Outcomes; Patients; Pattern; personalized management; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacotherapy; Phenotype; Population; Pre-Clinical Model; Primary Neoplasm; Property; public health relevance; Recurrence; Relapse; Resistance; resistance mechanism; response; Sampling; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; single cell analysis; Site; Specimen; SYK gene; targeted agent; targeted treatment; Testing; Time; transcriptome sequencing; Translational Research; Treatment outcome; treatment planning; tumor; tumor heterogeneity; tumor progression; tumor xenograft; tumorigenesis; United States; Validation; Veterans; whole genome; Work; Xenograft Model; Xenograft procedure; ","Phenotypic heterogeneity in small cell lung cancer.","001425","ONCB","Oncology B ","","","02","","","",""

The biochemical mechanism of fungal tRNA ligase (Trl1) is completely different from that of human tRNA ligase (RtcB), a situation that recommends Trl1 as target for anti-fungal drug discovery. To advance that end, we propose to structurally characterize tRNA ligases from several fungal species, including the human pathogens Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans, and Coccidioides immitis. Aspergillosis and Candidiasis are serious and frequently fatal infections of immunocompromised hosts, often associated with cancer (hematological malignancies) and cancer treatment (hematological stem cell transplantation).

Among the more common effects of high blood sugar and insulin is the occurrence of atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is characterized by constriction of important blood vessels that lead to and from the heart and brain, and eventual closer of blood vessels, which can lead to heart attacks and strokes. Associated with atherosclerosis is a condition called vascular inflammation. Inflammation aggravates atherosclerosis. This study examines some of the causes of vascular inflammation in vascular tissue and tries to determine the role that high concentrations of insulin play in atherosclerosis and vascular inflammation.

Angiogenesis (new generation of vessels) and neurogenesis (new generation of neurons) are two important endogenous mechanisms for neuronal replacement, repair and functional recovery after stroke. Therefore, strategies to enhance both angiogenesis/neurogenesis would greatly improve neuronal replacement and neurological recovery after stroke.  Our preliminary studies demonstrated that Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) can stimulate angiogenesis and neurogenesis after stroke. Importantly, we found that recombinant NAMPT protein can cross the blood-brain barrier, overcoming the drug-delivery problem for most central nerve system drugs. Therefore, the objective of this project is to investigate the therapeutic potential of NAMPT for the treatment of ischemic stroke, especially the long-term functional improvement.","8240074; ","CAO, GUODONG ;","","04/01/2014","09/30/2018","Acute; Adult; Anabolism; angiogenesis; Area; Blood - brain barrier anatomy; Blood capillaries; Brain; Brain Injuries; brain repair; C57BL/6 Mouse; capillary; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell Death Induction; Cell Proliferation; Cerebral Ischemia; Cerebrum; Clinical; clinically relevant; disability; Drug Delivery Systems; effective therapy; Endothelial Cells; enzyme biosynthesis; Fostering; functional improvement; functional outcomes; Generations; Human; improved; in vivo; Infarction; Intervention; Ischemia; Ischemic Brain Injury; Ischemic Stroke; Lead; Link; Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion; migration; Mission; Mus; neovascularization; Nerve; nerve stem cell; Nervous System Physiology; neurogenesis; Neurologic Deficit; Neurologic Effect; Neurological outcome; neurological recovery; neuronal replacement; Neurons; neuroprotection; neurorestoration; neurovascular; nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase; novel; overexpression; Patient Care; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Physically Handicapped; Population; post stroke; Production; Proteins; public health relevance; Quality of life; Recombinant Proteins; Recombinants; Recovery of Function; repaired; Reporting; Source; stroke; Stroke prevention; stroke rehabilitation; stroke survivor; success; System; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Agents; Transgenic Mice; Tube; Umbilical vein; United States; Veterans; Work; ","A Novel Intervention for Cerebral Ischemia","002346","NURC","Neurobiology C ","","","04","","","",""

However, in some areas, the number of patients with the malaria disease go up shortly after withdrawing the interventions suggesting that the currently deployed interventions may not be adequate to control and ultimately eliminate malaria in Uganda and elsewhere in Africa. The goal of the project proposed here is to examine the effects of two key interventions, Indoor residual spraying and treatment of populations with antimalarial drugs, on prevalence of low-level malaria infections (which are not detectable by standard malaria microscopy, but may contribute to transmission), measures of host immunity and the development of drug resistance.

Many people have increased risk for heart disease because of high cholesterol, high blood pressure or high blood sugar without knowing it, and the purpose of this research is to measure these in volunteer blood donors, develop a new way of informing people about their heart disease risk using the latest technologies, and test whether this new way of delivering information can reduce the risk of heart disease in some people. Because blood is collected anyway during the blood donation process and measurements use the same infrastructure, this research may establish a new, low-cost way of detecting people who are not aware of their increased heart disease risk, and of helping those people decrease their risk, which could have a major impact on public health.","10597195; ","GORE, MARIA ODETTE;","EINHORN, PAULA T.","06/08/2017","05/31/2021","Academic Medical Centers; Accounting; Address; Adopted; Adult; Affect; American; American Heart Association; apprenticeship; Area; Award; Awareness; base; Behavior; Behavior Therapy; Behavioral; Berry; Biological Markers; Blood; Blood Donations; Blood donor; Blood donor screening; Blood Glucose; Blood Pressure; Body Weight; Body Weights and Measures; Book Chapters; Cardiac; Cardiology; cardiometabolic risk; Cardiovascular Diseases; cardiovascular disorder prevention; cardiovascular disorder risk; cardiovascular health; cardiovascular risk factor; career; career development; Cause of Death; Cellular Phone; Cholesterol; cholesterol control; Clinical Investigator; Clinical Research; Clinical Sciences; cohort; Cohort Studies; Collaborations; Communication; Communities; Community Health; cost; cost effective; Cost Effectiveness Analysis; Country; Data; Databases; Demographic Factors; Detection; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; Diagnosis; Diet; Educational workshop; eHealth; Electronic Mail; Enrollment; Extramural Activities; Faculty; Fellowship; follow-up; Funding; Future; General Population; glycemic control; Glycosylated hemoglobin A; Goals; Grant; hands on research; Health; health care availability; Health Communication; Health Professional; Heart; heart disease risk; Heart Diseases; Height; hypercholesterolemia; Hypertension; hypertension treatment; improved; Incidence; Industry Standard; innovation; Institution; instrument; interest; Internal Medicine; Intervention; Journals; Leadership; Learning; Life; Lipids; Master of Science; Measurement; Measures; Medical center; medical schools; Medicine; meetings; Mentors; Mentorship; multidisciplinary; NHANES; Nobel Prize; novel; novel strategies; Outcome Measure; Pathway interactions; patient oriented research; Peer Review; Phase; Physical activity; Pilot Projects; Population; population based; Positioning Attribute; Prevalence; Prevention Research; Preventive; primary outcome; Primary Prevention; Probability; Process; programs; Public Health; Publications; Publishing; Randomized; Randomized Controlled Trials; randomized trial; Registries; Research; research and development; Research Infrastructure; Research Methodology; Research Personnel; Research Project Grants; Research Training; Residencies; Risk; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Role; Science; screening; secondary outcome; Secondary Prevention; Smoking; Smoking Status; social media; Socioeconomic Status; Structure; success; Surveys; symposium; Tablets; Technology; Teleconferences; Test Result; Testing; Texas; Text; therapy development; Time; Time trend; Training; United States; Universities; volunteer; web site; Weights and Measures; Woman; Work; Writing; ","Cardiovascular disease prevention in the community: The role of risk factorscreening and targeted health intervention in blood donors","131939","MPOR","NHLBI Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Review Committee ","","","02","150000","12000","162000",""

Chronic stress erythropoiesis, however, can dysregulate response circuits, and compromise the erythron. This includes the anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), cancer therapies, inflammation, iron imbalance, and hemoglobinopathies.

Based on our preliminary studies, we propose that HCV may cause premature T cell aging by up-regulating senescent markers such as KLRG1/DUSP6 through inhibiting miR155, dampening appropriate T cell responses to vaccinations during chronic infection. This project aims to explore how the expressions of these negative signaling molecules are regulated and interplay in CD4 T cells; and whether controlling these inhibitory pathways affects immune (vaccine) responses in HCV- infected patients. Understanding this mechanism is important for developing effective approaches to improve vaccine responses in chronically infected individuals, especially for veterans with HCV and/or HIV infection.

With this technique, ultrasound waves are delivered to the tumor in order to rapidly heat the diseased tissue, or ablate the tissue, and cause cell-death. There are concerns with HIFU regarding heating healthy tissue along with the diseased. In addition, there are concerns that to implement HIFU clinically would require large amounts of ultrasound energy and long surgery times. Our lab aims to show that a developing ultrasound contrast agent, known as phase-changing nanoagents (PCNAs), can minimize the heating of undesired areas, while enhancing the efficacy of HIFU, thus decreasing surgical time and energy requirements. This award will allow the characterization of PCNA formulations based on the in vivo properties of circulation time and penetration ability within the tumor, both of which have not been explored well and hinder technology progression. These characteristics of PCNAs will directly aid in optimizing PCNA formation for use in a PCNA-mediated HIFU pre- clinical pilot study.","12331934; ","NYANKIMA, ANGE GLORIA;","MCNEIL, NICOLE E","08/16/2016","08/15/2019","Ablation; Acoustics; Area; Asia; Award; Back; base; Behavior; Blood Circulation; Burn injury; Caliber; cancer diagnosis; Cardiovascular system; Cell Death; Characteristics; Clinical; clinical application; clinical translation; clinically significant; Communities; Contrast Media; Data; Deposition; design; Development; Diagnostic Imaging; Disease; Dose; effective therapy; Effectiveness; Encapsulated; Europe; Excision; Extravasation; Fluorocarbons; Focused Ultrasound Therapy; Formulation; Future; Gases; Generations; Goals; Half-Life; Heating; Hour; Image; imaging modality; improved; in vivo; Injury; Knowledge; Lead; Lesion; Liquid substance; Location; Mechanics; Mediating; Medical; melanoma; Metastatic Neoplasm to the Bone; Methods; Microbubbles; Microscopy; Modeling; Multiple Tumor Masses; Mus; nanoDroplet; nanometer; nanoparticle; nanosized; Nature; Necrosis; new technology; novel; Operative Surgical Procedures; Optics; Outcome; particle; Pathology; Penetration; Performance; Permeability; phase change; Physiologic pulse; Pilot Projects; pre-clinical; prevent; Process; Property; public health relevance; Recovery; Research Proposals; Rodent; Safety; Site; Skin; Specificity; Surgical complication; Techniques; Technology; Temperature; Testing; Therapeutic Uses; Thermal Ablation Therapy; Thinness; Time; Tissues; tool; Translations; Treatment Efficacy; tumor; tumor ablation; Ultrasonic Therapy; Ultrasonic wave; Ultrasonography; Uterine Fibroids; Work; ","Enhancing High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound for Tumor Ablation with Phase-Changing Nanoagents","206602","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","37165","","37165",""

Our research education program consists of three phases: (1) develop and implement a 1-week workshop on systems science methods (with a focus on agent-based modeling and system dynamics); (2) iteratively refine and improve the materials over three successive deployments as part of a summer graduate program and (3) package the workshop as a set of curricular materials for distribution as a stand-alone introduction to systems science that can be taught by researchers or faculty at many institutions without requiring an existing strong expertise in systems approaches.","8775340; ","BRUCH, ELIZABETH EVE;","BURES, REGINA M","08/15/2014","07/31/2019","Acute; AIDS/HIV problem; base; Behavior; Biological Models; Chronic Disease; cohesion; Complex; Data; design; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; Drug resistance; dynamic system; education research; Educational Curriculum; Educational process of instructing; Educational workshop; Enrollment; Ensure; Evaluation; Exercise; experience; Exposure to; Faculty; Feedback; Goals; graduate student; Grant; Health; improved; Individual; innovation; Institutes; Institution; Instruction; instructor; interest; Intervention; Knowledge; learning materials; lectures; Length; Light; materials science; Methodology; Methods; Michigan; model building; Modeling; Motivation; Mutate; Obesity; pathogen; pedagogy; Persons; Phase; Polishes; Process; programs; Public Health; Public Health Education; public health relevance; public health research; Publications; Quality of life; Research; Research Personnel; Scholarship; Science; Scientist; Secure; skills; Stress; Structure; Students; Substance abuse problem; Sum; System; Teaching Materials; Teaching Method; Techniques; Testing; theories; tool; Training; Training Activity; Universities; Violence; Work; ","Dynamic Systems Science Modeling for Public Health","082971","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","04","191826","9119","200945",""

However, little i known about the neural mechanisms for multisensory speech perception. We propose to remedy this knowledge gap using electrocorticography, which is ideally suited to investigate the dynamics of speech perception at high temporal (millisecond) and spatial (millimeter) resolution.

Approximately 20% of the 2 million troops who have been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan may require treatment for PTSD. Bipolar disorder, a sequel to the PTSD is common among Veterans. Currently ~30% of the bipolar Veterans receive chronic lithium therapy, which also effectively prevents suicidal tendencies. However, the therapeutic use of lithium is often limited by the development of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), a kidney condition. Currently used medications for the treatment of NDI have side effects and may not be suitable in many Veterans. The observations made by the applicants that P2Y12 receptor can be targeted for the treatment of lithium-induced NDI opened an avenue for the development of better therapeutic modalities.

Each year, approximately 5,000 Veterans are diagnosed with this disease. A significant proportion of these individuals will present with advanced disease. Although there are several approved agents for advanced kidney cancer, the efficacy of these agents is limited and the vast majority of these patients will succumb to their disease. Therefore, new approaches to this cancer are desperately needed. It is now well recognized that altered metabolism is a hallmark of cancer. However, the mechanisms by which this occurs and the clinical relevance of this alteration remains poorly understood. This proposal aims to provide insight into the mechanisms by which kidney cancers reconfigure their metabolism and to determine the impact of this altered metabolic profile on tumor formation and/or development. The findings from the proposed studies should provide new therapeutic approaches with the eventual goal of improving outcomes for Veterans affected by this malignancy.","9217564; ","SUDARSHAN, SUNIL ;","","04/01/2015","03/31/2019","advanced disease; Affect; Automobile Driving; base; Biogenesis; Citric Acid Cycle; Clinic; Clinical; clinically relevant; Data; Deposition; Development; Diagnosis; Disease; Disease Management; Disease Progression; DNA Methylation; DNA Modification Process; Enzymes; Epigenetic Process; epigenome; estrogen-related receptor; Face; FOXG1B gene; Fumarate Hydratase; Gene Expression; Genetic Transcription; Glycolysis; Goals; histone modification; Histones; improved; improved outcome; In Vitro; in vivo; Individual; innovation; insight; Kidney; Kidney Neoplasms; Knowledge; Laboratories; Lead; Link; Malignant Epithelial Cell; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; men; Messenger RNA; Metabolic; Metabolic Pathway; metabolic profile; Metabolism; Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer; Methylation; Mitochondria; mitochondrial metabolism; Modernization; Molecular; mRNA Expression; Neoplasm Metastasis; novel; novel strategies; novel therapeutic intervention; novel therapeutics; Outcome; outcome forecast; Oxidative Phosphorylation; Pathway interactions; Patient-Focused Outcomes; Patients; Pharmacology; Phenotype; PPAR gamma; Primary Neoplasm; Proteins; public health relevance; receptor; Renal carcinoma; Renal Cell Carcinoma; Reporting; Research; Resistance; Respiratory Chain; Role; Sampling; targeted treatment; Testing; The Cancer Genome Atlas; Therapeutic; transcription factor; translational impact; Treatment Efficacy; treatment strategy; tumor; tumor growth; tumor metabolism; tumorigenesis; tumorigenic; Tumorigenicity; Veterans; Woman; ","Reprogramming of Mitochondrial Metabolism in Renal Cancer","002930","ONCA","Oncology A ","","","03","","","",""
