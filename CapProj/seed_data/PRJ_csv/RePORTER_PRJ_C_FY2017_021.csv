It is estimated that about two-thirds of the U.S. population is overweight or obese with 300 million obese adults worldwide. Alarmingly, over two- thirds of U.S. children are also overweight or obese. The incidence of type-II diabetes during this time period has also significantly increased. This is thought to be a direct result of he obesity epidemic. Obesity is a key factor in the development of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. The worldwide obesity epidemic continues to increase, which demands an urgent need to delineate the mechanisms capable of curbing the development of obesity and the progression of metabolic syndromes and potentially fatal health conditions that accompany increased adiposity. This is essential for the design of new therapeutic approaches to intervene in this process. However, the molecular events that connect obesity, lipid deregulation and human diseases, such as metabolic syndromes and cancer, are still unclear. Fundamental questions are: what are the molecular players and events that regulate total adiposity in an organism? What are the key targets of the pathways that control metabolism and the maintenance of lipid homeostasis?

Changes in the mechanics of the environment or defects in the cellular mechanoresponse are involved in a plethora of diseases including atherosclerosis, heart failure and cancer. A major challenge in the field is understanding mechanotransduction - the mechanisms by which mechanical information is detected and communicated to pathways that control cell behavior. Proteins containing LIM domains represent a large family of tension sensitive factors that detect mechanical stress to mount cellular responses; however, they detect these stresses by a completely unknown mechanism. Understanding how LIM domains function to detect and transmit information about mechanical stress will result in a deeper understanding of mechanotransduction, which is important for developing strategies of disease treatment and organ regeneration.","10202485; ","WINKELMAN, JONATHAN DAVID;","FLICKER, PAULA F.","02/01/2017","01/31/2020","Actins; Actomyosin; Address; Adherens Junction; alpha Actinin; Apoptosis; Atherosclerosis; Binding; Binding Sites; Biochemical; Biological Assay; Biotin; blebbistatin; cell behavior; Cell division; Cell Proliferation; Cells; Cellular biology; Confocal Microscopy; crosslink; Cytoskeleton; Decision Making; Defect; Detection; Disease; Distant; Environment; experience; Extracellular Matrix; Family; Family member; Fiber; Fibroblasts; Focal Adhesions; Heart failure; Human; In Vitro; Indium; inhibitor/antagonist; Label; Light; LIM Domain; LIM Domain Protein; Malignant Neoplasms; Maps; Mass Spectrum Analysis; mechanical force; mechanical load; mechanical properties; Mechanical Stress; Mechanics; mechanotransduction; member; Microfilaments; Modeling; Molecular; Monitor; Myosin ATPase; Myosin Type II; Nature; organ regeneration; Pathway interactions; Process; Proteins; Reading; reconstitution; Recruitment Activity; repaired; Research; research study; Resolution; response; Rupture; sensor; Signal Pathway; Site; Specificity; Streptavidin; Stress; Stress Fibers; Stretching; Structure; System; Testing; Tissues; Translating; unnatural amino acids; vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein; ZYX gene; ","Mechanosensing in LIM Domain Proteins","122372","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","56694","","56694",""

This invasion process used by filoviruses is unusual in its complexity, and coopts many of our own proteins and pathways. Previous work by us and others has shed light on this mechanism, but the final steps in invasion that allow the virus to reach the cytoplasm still remain mysterious. Using new tools that allow us to `catch the virus in the act', we will uncover exactly how filoviruses escape into the cytoplasm, and how they exploits our cells during this process.

We have found that special cells (called fibroblasts) form the structure of the membrane that lines joints, known as the synovium. These special cells form a bed (called the stroma) to which all the inflammatory white blood cells attach. By targeting these cells, we disrupt the comfortable bed that the inflammatory cells need to produce inflammation. The cells that make up the bed and the markers we have found they express offer new targets for treating inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis","1860775; ","BRENNER, MICHAEL B;","MAO, SU-YAU ","02/01/2015","01/31/2020","3-Dimensional; Adhesions; Animal Model; Architecture; Arthritis; B-Lymphocytes; Beds; Biology; cadherin-11; Cartilage; Cell Adhesion Molecules; Cell Differentiation process; Cell Line; Cell surface; Cells; chemokine; Chronic; Coculture Techniques; Collagen-Induced Arthritis; cytokine; Data; Disease; Fibroblasts; Goals; Health; Human; Hyperplasia; In Vitro; in vivo; in vivo Model; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Inflammatory Arthritis; inflammatory milieu; insight; Interleukin-6; joint injury; Joints; Leucocytic infiltrate; leukocyte activation; Leukocytes; lymph nodes; macrophage; mast cell; Mediating; Membrane; Mesenchymal; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Modeling; monocyte; monolayer; Mus; Organ Culture Techniques; Pain; Pathway interactions; Phenotype; Production; Regulation; research study; Rheumatoid Arthritis; RNA Interference; Role; Sampling; Severities; Stromal Cells; Structure; Surface; Swelling; Synovial Membrane; Synovitis; T-Lymphocyte; T-Lymphocyte Subsets; Testing; three dimensional cell culture; Tissues; tumor; Work; ","Cadherin 11 Regulates Synovial Inflammation in Arthritis","063709","ACTS","Arthritis, Connective Tissue and Skin Study Section ","","","03","198000","148987","346987",""

Extensive clinical and preclinical work demonstrates that endocannabinoid signaling powerfully regulates the motivational impact of rewards, but the utility of endocannabinoid-targeted treatments for disorders such as obesity or drug abuse has been hindered due to non-specific drug actions and unacceptable side effects.

Using listener transcriptions of dysarthric speech, along with a suite of automated acoustic metrics, the predictive model uses machine-learning algorithms to learn the relationship between speech acoustics and listener percepts. Ultimately, this model will allow clinicians to predict the outcomes of an intervention strategy to assess its utility for a patient.

As such, it remains poorly understood how cells sense and selectively respond to ECM characteristics in order to achieve biologically and clinically significant responses. The objective of the proposed research aims to investigate cell-ECM contacts and downstream cell signaling as mesenchymal cells adopt anteroposterior cell morphologies in physiologically relevant 3D ECM microenvironments.

The proposed studies are directed towards resolving this problem by exploring and overcoming the remaining barriers that currently prevent pig organs from being transplanted successfully into patients with end-stage organ (heart, kidney, lung, liver) failure. It is anticipated that these barriers can be overcome by the use of organs from unique genetically-engineered pigs and novel reagents.          Project 1: Prolonging life-supported pig kidney and heart graft survival in baboons by suppressing inflammation     Project Leader (PL): Cooper, D.          DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Experimental xenotransplantation (xenoTx), in the form of pig organ transplantation (Tx) in nonhuman primates, has made major advances during the past 10 years since this NIAID funding mechanism was introduced. The problems of early immune rejection and coagulation dysregulation have been greatly reduced, but there is increasing evidence that an inflammatory response may be activating the immune system and/or amplifying coagulation dysfunction.  The overall hypothesis that will be investigated in Project 1 is that an inflammatory response plays a significant role in pig kidney and heart graft failure after Tx into baboons, and that its prevention or suppression will result in prolonged graf survival. The mechanisms whereby anti-inflammatory agents prolong graft survival, e.g., by reducing the innate or adaptive immune response, or by minimizing coagulation dysfunction, will be comprehensively investigated. The current proposal will therefore aim to confirm that the combination of (i) unique multi-gene pigs (i.e., pigs with 6 or 7 genetic modifications to protect their tissues from the primate immune response and from the effects of coagulation dysregulation), (ii) an effective immunosuppressive (IS) regimen, and (iii) a targeted anti-inflammatory regimen will, together, allow consistent function of life-supporting pig kidneys and hearts for >6 months in the absence of rejection or coagulopathy.  In Aim 1 (investigated in Pittsburgh), we will explore the effect of selected anti-inflammatory agents on life-supporting kidney graft survival in baboons receiving kidneys from multi-gene pigs and using the proven IS regimen (developed during the present 5-year funding period). If the expected outcome is not consistently achieved, we will transplant kidneys from pigs (available to us in 2016-17) expressing different / additional transgenes that might prove advantageous.  In Aim 2 (NHLBI), in the heterotopic (non-life-supporting) heart Tx model we shall investigate whether all components of the previously successful IS regimen are essential or whether, after the Tx of a heart from a multi-gene pig (+/- an effective anti-inflammatory regimen), the IS regimen can be minimized, or anticoagulation omitted, thus reducing the risks of long-term therapy, e.g., opportunistic infection or bleeding. Promising approaches will be evaluated in a life-supporting orthotopic model.

Most studies on the functions of PHB1 were conducted in yeast and cells growing in Petri dishes. The role of PHB1 in intact animal is unclear as embryonic deletion is lethal. We have developed a mouse model of liver-specific deletion of PHB1 and demonstrated that deficiency in PHB1 resulted in significant liver injury, inflammation, fibrosis, cell death, and liver cancer formation. Using this highly novel model, we can gain for the first time, important insights into the role that this protein plays in maintaining liver health. This isan area largely unknown and our project should pave the way to improve our understanding of the roles of PHB1 in liver health and cancer. Successful completion of this project may identify decreased PHB1 expression as a risk factor for the development of liver injury and cancer and provide rationale for design of therapy targeting PHB1.","1895258; ","LU, SHELLY CHI-LOO;","SALNIKOW, KONSTANTIN ","01/10/2014","12/31/2018","Acetaminophen; Acute; Animals; Apoptosis; Area; Bile Acids; bile duct; Binding; Biochemical; Biogenesis; Biological Process; Cancer cell line; Cell Death; Cell Line; Cells; Cessation of life; Chronic; Crista ampullaris; Cyclin D1; Data; Development; Down-Regulation; Dysplasia; Embryo; Epigenetic Process; Ethanol; Exhibits; falls; Fibrosis; Genes; Genetic Transcription; Goals; Growth; H19 gene; HDAC4 gene; Health; Hepatocarcinogenesis; hepatocellular carcinoma cell line; Hepatocyte; Histologic; Histone Deacetylase; Histones; Human; Immunohistochemistry; Impairment; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; Inflammation; Injury; Injury to Liver; insight; Insulin-Like Growth Factor II; Investigation; knock-down; Knock-out; Knockout Mice; Laboratories; Lead; Ligation; Link; Liver; liver injury; male; Malignant neoplasm of liver; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; Messenger RNA; methionine adenosyltransferase; Mitochondria; mitochondrial dysfunction; Mitochondrial Proteins; Modeling; Molecular; Molecular Chaperones; mouse model; Mus; Natural regeneration; Necrosis; nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; novel; Nuclear; Oncogenes; Oncogenic; Optic Atrophy; overexpression; Oxidative Stress; Patients; Phenotype; Play; Predisposition; prevent; Primary biliary cirrhosis; Primary carcinoma of the liver cells; Process; prohibitin; promoter; protein expression; Proteins; Public Health; Reporting; Risk Factors; Role; Staging; Staining method; Stains; Steatohepatitis; Stem cells; Swelling; targeted treatment; Testing; therapy design; Time; toxicant; Translating; Tumor Suppressor Genes; Tumor Suppressor Proteins; Tumorigenicity; vector; Wild Type Mouse; Work; Yeasts; ","PROHIBITIN 1 IN LIVER INJURY AND CANCER","172086","XNDA","Xenobiotic and Nutrient Disposition and Action Study Section ","","","04","192200","88963","281163",""

The WHO advises countries to continue vaccination 10 years after eradication is certified and many countries plan to stockpile polio vaccine for biosecurity reasons. We estimate a need for 5-6B vaccine doses over the next 20-30 years. IPV is produced by inactivating purified virus by prolonged incubations with formalin which reduces the immunogenicity and leads to a relatively high price of $3-5/dose compared with $0.12/dose for OPV.  In a Phase 1 project, we tested a recent discovery for improving the immunogenicity of IPV while reducing the manufacturing costs at least 10-fold. Our collaborator, Dr. Michael Daly, found that a decapeptide-manganese complex protects the protein component from ionizing effects of high doses of radiation. Using PV2, we have optimized the conditions to inactivate 100% of the infectivity while protecting the antigenic proteins from radiation damage. In immunization studies in animals, we found that, at lower antigen doses, the irradiated PV2 stimulates significantly higher neutralizing responses compared to the commercial IPV used at the same concentrations. In this Phase 2, we propose to extend the studies to include PV1 and PV3 serotypes and to perform additional animal studies to solidify the immunization results. We will optimize the concentrations of the three viruses in the trivalent vaccine and perform additional studies on the mechanism of antigen protection. In addition, we will investigate lyophilization as a method of improving long-term storage of the vaccine and other measures to prepare for IND-enabling studies. If successful, this vaccine may help ensure a polio-free future by developing a safer and more cost-effective vaccine.","1946392; ","TOBIN, GREGORY JOHN;","PARK, EUN-CHUNG ","05/15/2015","01/31/2019","abstracting; Animals; Antibodies; Antigens; Attenuated; Bacteria; Binding; Biohazardous Substance; Biological Preservation; biosecurity; Capsid Proteins; cGMP production; Chemicals; Cold Chains; commercialization; Communities; Complex; cost; cost effective; Country; crosslink; Cryoelectron Microscopy; Data; Dedications; Deinococcus radiodurans; Developing Countries; Development; DNA; Dose; Ebola virus; Ensure; Epitopes; Excipients; Formalin; Freeze Drying; Future; Goals; Government; Hand; Hela Cells; High Pressure Liquid Chromatography; Human; Human poliovirus; Immune; Immunity; Immunization; immunogenicity; improved; Incubated; inorganic phosphate; interest; irradiation; Life; link protein; Manganese; Manufacturer Name; Marketing; Mass Vaccinations; Measures; meetings; Methods; milligram; neutralizing antibody; novel vaccines; Oral Poliovirus Vaccine; oxidative damage; pathogen; Peptides; Phase; phase 1 study; Phenotype; Poliomyelitis; Poliovirus Vaccines; Preparation; Price; Procedures; Process; Production; protein degradation; Proteins; Radiation; Radiation induced damage; radioresistant; Rattus; reconstitution; Refrigeration; Regulatory Pathway; Residual state; response; Risk; risk perception; RNA; Safety; Scientist; Serotyping; Serum-Free Culture Media; Shipping; Ships; Site; Small Business Innovation Research Grant; Staging; Technology; Testing; Time; Tissue Culture Techniques; Transportation; Vaccination; Vaccines; Vero Cells; Viral; Viral Genome; Virus; Virus Diseases; Virus Shedding; Wistar Rats; Zika Virus; ","Development of an improved, low-cost polio vaccine (Ir-IPV)","120260","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","","","743104",""

Results from the study will be important for two reasons. First, the proposed study will use existing plasma samples and data on cognition and brain imaging from Framingham Heart Study (FHS) to test the concept that a high level of plasma amylin will be a protective factor for cognitive decline and brain aging. Positive findings will provide a rationale for opening a new therapeutic avenue for AD with amylin type peptides. Second, pramlintide is an amylin analog and an FDA approved diabetic drug with a favorable safety profile. Should this study show plasma amylin's protective effect on cognitive decline and the development of AD, it will serve as evidence for a large clinical trial of pramlintide. Repurposing of pramlintide for AD treatment will involve shortr trial time at a substantially lower cost than developing a new drug. Finally, this study can provid 'go or no go' information regarding an amylin pathway as a target for the therapeutics of AD.","8624912; 6070528 (contact); ","AU, RHODA ; QIU, WEI QIAO WENDY (contact);","ANDERSON, DALLAS ","05/01/2015","01/31/2020","Age; aging brain; Aging-Related Process; Alleles; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's disease risk; Amyloid; amyloid peptide; analog; apolipoprotein E-4; Attenuated; base; Blood; Blood - brain barrier anatomy; Brain; Brain imaging; brain morphology; brain volume; CCL2 gene; cerebral atrophy; Cerebrospinal Fluid; cerebrovascular; Cerebrovascular system; Clinical; Clinical Trials; Cognition; cognitive change; cognitive function; cohort; Communities; cost; Cross-Sectional Studies; Data; Data Set; Dementia; Deposition; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; diabetic; Drug Targeting; Elderly; ethnic minority population; Ethnic Origin; executive function; FDA approved; Framingham Heart Study; Generations; genetic risk factor; glucose metabolism; Health; Hormones; Horns; ICAM1 gene; IL6 gene; Image; Impaired cognition; improved; Incidence; indexing; Inflammation; inflammatory marker; innovation; Insulin; Intraperitoneal Injections; islet amyloid polypeptide; Isoprostanes; Lead; Learning; Leptin; Lipids; lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A(2); Longitudinal Studies; Measures; Mediating; Memory; mild cognitive impairment; mouse model; Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; novel therapeutics; offspring; Pancreas; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Patients; peptide A; Peptides; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase; Phase III Clinical Trials; Plasma; population based; Pramlintide; prevent; protective effect; Regulation; Safety; Sampling; sex; Structure; Study Subject; targeted treatment; Testing; Therapeutic; Thick; Time; TNFRSF1B gene; Urine; Vascular Diseases; Visuospatial; ","Plasma Amylin Impact on Cognitive Function and Brain Morphology in the Framingham Heart Study","049899","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","03","184500","117526","302026",""

Those images will be analyzed to look at deformation shape features, as well as a novel stiffness parameter, both ex vivo and clinically in glaucoma, diabetes, and corneal disease. At the conclusion of this study, we will have created a comprehensive database of ex vivo and in vivo corneal deformation response parameters as a function of IOP, corneal stiffness parameter, and in vivo ocular disease.

Greater than 80% of people with T2D are obese. Yet, most people who are obese are not diabetic. We have reproduced this obesity-T2D dichotomy in mice by studying two mouse strains, C57BL/6 and BTBR T (+) tf, which differ in obesity-induced T2D. Using a mapping and breeding strategy, we identified a mutation in the gene that encodes tomosyn-2. A mutation in tomosyn-2 directly correlates with reduced insulin secretion, elevated plasma glucose, and reduced plasma insulin levels. We are the first to connect this relatively unknown protein with insulin homeostasis, and it is still unclear what role tomosyn-2 plays in insulin secretion. This proposal will investigate both the mechanism that regulates tomosyn-2 activity and its role in regulating insulin secretion. Together, this will provide insight into the novel mechanism regulating insulin secretion in T2D.","10599080; ","BHATNAGAR, SUSHANT ;","SATO, SHERYL M","02/15/2016","02/14/2019","Affect; Animal Model; Animals; Area; Award; Beta Cell; Binding; Binding Proteins; Biochemical; Biochemistry; Biological Assay; Blood Glucose; Breeding; career; career development; Cell Line; Cell membrane; Cell physiology; Cells; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16; Code; Complex; Confocal Microscopy; Congenic Mice; Congenic Strain; Cytoplasmic Granules; Defect; design; Development; diabetic; Disease; Drug Targeting; Epidemic; Exocytosis; experience; Fasting; fasting plasma glucose; forward genetics; Gelsolin; Generations; Genes; Genetic; genetic regulatory protein; Glucose; Goals; Grant; Health; Homeostasis; Hyperglycemia; Hypoglycemia; In Vitro; insight; Insulin; insulin granule; Insulin Resistance; insulin secretion; Intervention; islet; Knockout Mice; Laboratories; Learning; Life; Liposomes; Maps; Mass Spectrum Analysis; member; Membrane; Mentors; mouse model; Mouse Strains; Mus; Mutation; non-genetic; Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; novel; Obesity; Open Reading Frames; Pancreas; Pathway interactions; Patients; Peripheral; peripheral blood; Phase; Phenotype; Phosphorylation; Phosphorylation Site; Plasma; Play; Post-Translational Protein Processing; Predisposition; prevent; PRKCA gene; protein degradation; Proteins; Quantitative Trait Loci; receptor; Regulation; Research; Risk; risk variant; Role; secretion process; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Single Nucleotide Polymorphism; SNAP receptor; Societies; Structure of beta Cell of islet; synaptotagmin I; syntaxin; Techniques; Therapeutic; tool; Training; ubiquitin-protein ligase; Ubiquitination; Work; ","THE ROLE OF TOMOSYN-2 IN INSULIN SECRETION","095975","NSS","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","04","152279","68186","220465",""
