In laboratory studies, we have found that these alterations lead tumor cells to  change their identity and thereby become resistant to anticancer therapies that target the  androgen receptor. In this project, we will attempt to confirm the role of these two genes and  others in the increased cellular variety of tumor cells circulating in the blood of patients with  prostate cancer.

The validity of these targets will be tested in a clinical trial using a novel drug, and has the  potential of improving therapeutic responses in this aggressive disease.","1885125; ","ZELENETZ, ANDREW D.;","","08/30/2016","07/31/2021","Accounting; Acetylation; Acetyltransferase; Affect; Animals; B-Cell Development; B-Cell NonHodgkins Lymphoma; B-Lymphocytes; base; BCL2 gene; BCL6 gene; Binding; Biological Markers; Biopsy; Cell Line; cell transformation; Cells; ChIP-seq; Clinical; clinical efficacy; Clinical Trials; Clonal Expansion; Code; Complement; CREBBP gene; Data; Deacetylase; Deacetylation; Defect; Deletion Mutation; density; design; Development; Diagnosis; Disease; Drug resistance; Drug Targeting; Enhancers; EP300 gene; Epigenetic Process; Event; Evolution; exome sequencing; Follicular Lymphoma; functional loss; Gene Dosage; Gene Expression Profile; Gene Silencing; Genes; Genetic; genome-wide analysis; Genomics; histone acetyltransferase; Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor; Histones; Human; improved; in vivo; inhibitor/antagonist; Knock-out; large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; Lesion; Lymphoma; Lymphomagenesis; Maintenance; Malignant Neoplasms; Mature B-Lymphocyte; Mediating; Methylation; Molecular; Mouse Strains; Mutant Strains Mice; Mutate; Mutation; Mutation Detection; Nature; next generation; novel; novel therapeutics; Oncogenes; Oncogenic; Other Genetics; Pathogenesis; Pathologic; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase; Phase II Clinical Trials; Play; Point Mutation; pre-clinical; Pre-Clinical Model; Preclinical Testing; precursor cell; promoter; protein activation; Protein p53; Proteins; Recurrence; Relapse; Reporting; Resolution; response; Role; Safety; Sequence Analysis; Signal Pathway; Single Nucleotide Polymorphism; Site; Stratification; Structure of germinal center of lymph node; Testing; Therapeutic; therapeutic target; Transcription Coactivator; Treatment Protocols; treatment response; tumorigenesis; Universities; ","Targeting Acetyltransferase Gene Inactivation in Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma","192937","ZCA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","7614","A1","01","284694","96672","","381366"

While  enzalutamide and abiraterone acetate are effective for most patients, tumors eventually become resistant and  begin to grow again. In the laboratory, we have found that some tumors become resistant by increasing the  level of a protein called GR, and we also found that an investigational drug called a BET inhibitor reduces GR  levels in these tumors and causes them to shrink. This project will investigate whether different types of GR  promote resistance to enzalutamide, how BET inhibitors work in prostate cancer cells, and whether BET  inhibitors can shrink tumors in patients with advanced prostate cancer whose disease progressed on  enzalutamide and abiraterone acetate.","1879400; ","SAWYERS, CHARLES L.;","","09/14/2001","08/31/2021","abiraterone; abstracting; Acetates; Androgen Receptor; Basic Science; Biological Markers; Biopsy; Cancer Patient; castration resistant prostate cancer; Cell Line; ChIP-seq; Clinical; Clinical Sciences; CRISPR/Cas technology; Data; Detection; Development; Disease; Disease Progression; Doctor of Philosophy; Drug resistance; Effectiveness; Epigenetic Process; Evaluation; Gene Expression Profile; Generations; Glucocorticoid Receptor; Hematologic Neoplasms; Hormones; improved; inhibitor/antagonist; Initiator Codon; Injection of therapeutic agent; insight; Investigational Drugs; Laboratories; Lead; Length; male; Malignant neoplasm of prostate; men; Methods; Modeling; Monoclonal Antibodies; Multicenter Trials; N-terminal; novel; Organoids; Output; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase; Phase I Clinical Trials; Pre-Clinical Model; predictive marker; prostate cancer cell; prostate cancer model; Protein Family; Protein Isoforms; Proteins; Quality of life; receptor expression; receptor upregulation; Refractory Disease; Research Project Grants; research study; Resistance; resistance mechanism; response; Role; Sampling; targeted agent; Technology; Testosterone; therapeutic target; Tissue Sample; Translation Initiation; tumor; Up-Regulation; Validation; Work; Xenograft procedure; ","Research Project 4:Investigating and targeting the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in enzalutamide- and abiraterone-resistant prostate cancer","092629","ZCA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","8663","","16","119101","85150","","180614"

Unfortunately these antibodies are not fully effective in most patients, so understanding how they work  and why they don?t work effectively for all patients will likely improve their success in cancer patients. We have  shown that one such antibody, cetuximab, which is FDA-approved for head and neck cancer, may have limited  success for patients because of inhibitory signals in the immune system. We plan to combine cetuximab with a  second antibody that targets these inhibitory signals with the expectation that this approach can improve the  success of cetuximab in head and neck cancer patients.","1900219; ","FERRIS, ROBERT L;","UJHAZY, PETER ","07/01/2002","06/30/2020","Antibodies; base; Biological Markers; Cancer Patient; cancer therapy; cancer type; CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes; CD8B1 gene; Cessation of life; Cetuximab; Clinical; Clinical Trials; combinatorial; Combined Modality Therapy; CTLA4 gene; Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated Protein 4; Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes; Data; EGFR Protein Overexpression; Employee Strikes; Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor; exhaustion; expectation; FDA approved; Frequencies; Future; Generations; Head and Neck Cancer; head and neck cancer patient; Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma; HPV-High Risk; Human Papillomavirus; Immune; Immune system; Immunotherapeutic agent; Immunotherapy; improved; interest; Ligands; Lymphocyte antigen; Mediating; Minority; Modeling; Monoclonal Antibodies; Myelogenous; Natural immunosuppression; Neoadjuvant Therapy; neoplastic cell; novel; patient population; Patients; PDCD1LG1 gene; peripheral blood; Phase; Phenotype; Population; potential biomarker; predicting response; programs; Radiation; receptor; receptor expression; Regulatory T-Lymphocyte; response; Sampling; Signal Transduction; Solid Neoplasm; success; Survival Rate; T cell response; T-Lymphocyte; Testing; Transforming Growth Factor beta; Translating; tumor; Tumor Antigens; tumor microenvironment; Tumor Tissue; University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute; Up-Regulation; Work; ","Checkpoint Receptor Targeting to Enhance Cetuximab Efficacy Against HNSCC","097190","ZCA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","6669","","12","100404","53618","","153904"
