Moreover, health disparities in African Americans concerning type 2 diabetes and age-related declines in functional performance may be linked to changes in muscle quality. Therefore, the objectives of this VA Historically Black College and University career development project are to: 1) develop a rapid, portable, cost-effective method for assessing muscle mass and quality using ultrasound imaging, and 2) demonstrate how an innovative form of strength training that is appropriate for older adults can reverse age-related changes in muscle mass and quality. Completion of this project will aid the identification of risk factors for age-related muscle wastig and expand the approach to exercise-based interventions.","10850907; ","HARRIS-LOVE, MICHAEL ;","","04/01/2015","03/31/2020","Activities of Daily Living; Address; Adipose tissue; Affect; African American; Age; age related; Aging; base; Cardiovascular system; career development; Clinic; clinical Diagnosis; Clinical Research; Consensus; cost; cost effective; Coupled; Detection; Development; Diagnosis; Diagnostic; disability; Disease; Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry; Elderly; Enrollment; Event; Exercise; Fatty acid glycerol esters; Female; Flexor; Fracture; functional decline; Functional disorder; functional status; Goals; Health; health disparity; Healthcare; High Prevalence; Historically Black Colleges and Universities; Home environment; Impairment; improved; Incidence; Injury; innovation; International; Intervention; Intramuscular; Joints; K-Series Research Career Programs; Knee; Laboratories; Link; Literature; loss of function; Love; Measures; Mentorship; Metabolic; Methods; mode of exercise; Modeling; Muscle; muscle form; Muscle function; muscle strength; Muscle Weakness; Muscular Atrophy; Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; novel strategies; Osteoporosis; Outcome; Outcome Study; Participant; Pathology; Patients; Performance; Preventive care; Process; Production; prospective; Race; Randomized; rectus femoris; Regimen; Reporting; Research; resistance exercise; response; Risk Factors; Sarcomeres; sarcopenia; Scanning; Scientist; screening; Secondary to; Signal Transduction; Skeletal Muscle; strength training; Therapeutic exercise; Tissues; Torque; Training; Training Programs; Ultrasonography; Universities; Walking; X-Ray Computed Tomography; ","Detection and Treatment of Sarcopenia and Myosteatosis in Older African Americans","001854","HBCU","VA-ORD Historically Black College and University Research Scientist Training Program ","","","03","","","",""

Despite hundreds of individual piRNA clusters encoded in our genomes, we do not know the role that individual piRNA clusters play in regulating gene expression during vertebrate germ cell development. To address this question, we will explore the regulation of Piwi-Associated Transcripts (PATs) in the model vertebrate Xenopus. We will then create a Xenopus mutant that disrupts a single piRNA cluster locus to examine which PATs are mis- regulated. This project will shed new light on the mechanisms for how piRNAs and PIWI proteins regulate germ cell and embryonic gene expression, and the PATs we identify will be useful markers for assessing the health of germ cells and embryos.","8193930; ","LAU, NELSON C;","TAYMANS, SUSAN ","04/24/2017","03/31/2019","abstracting; Address; Affect; Animals; Binding; Biochemical; Biological Assay; Candidate Disease Gene; Cell Death; Child; Complex; Development; Dissection; DNA Transposable Elements; Embryo; Embryonic Development; experimental study; Female; Fertility; Fertility Study; Foundations; Future; Gametogenesis; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Targeting; Genes; Genetic Transcription; Genome; Genomic approach; Germ Cells; Goals; Gonadal structure; Health; Human; In Vitro; in vivo; Individual; insight; Knock-out; Knowledge; Light; Location; male; Modeling; Molecular Profiling; Mus; mutant; Mutate; Mutation; Oocytes; Ovary; Pathway interactions; Phenotype; piRNA; Play; Production; Proteins; Rana; Regulation; Regulator Genes; Reproductive Health; Role; Small RNA; Structure of primordial sex cell; System; Testing; Transcript; transcriptome; vertebrate genome; Xenopus; Xenopus oocyte; ","The impact of Piwi associated transcripts in Xenopus germ cell development","088792","DEV1","Development - 1 Study Section ","","A1","01","150000","88479","238479",""

Understanding the basic biology of how normal hair cell systems function is essential for continued progress towards diagnosing and treating hearing and balance disorders, which have devastating social and health consequences for millions of Americans worldwide.","9864948; ","LIAO, JAMES CHIENAN;","CYR, JANET ","07/01/2010","06/30/2017","Ablation; Address; Afferent Neurons; Age; American; Architecture; Auditory; auditory pathway; Behavior; Biological; Biological Assay; Biology; cell type; Cells; Cellular Morphology; cellular transduction; Code; Communication; Data; design; Development; Diagnosis; Dyes; Electrophysiology (science); equilibration disorder; Equilibrium; Event; experimental study; Fire - disasters; Foundations; Frequencies; Functional disorder; Ganglia; Genetic; Genetic Models; Goals; Growth; Hair Cells; Health; Hearing; Hearing problem; Human; in vivo; information processing; Knowledge; Labyrinth; lateral line; Maps; Mechanics; mechanotransduction; Membrane; Morphology; Motor; neuromast; neuronal cell body; Neurons; Optics; Pathway interactions; Pattern; Physiology; Play; Positioning Attribute; Probability; Process; Property; receptor; relating to nervous system; response; Role; Sensory; Shapes; signal processing; Signal Transduction; Site; social; Staging; Stereotyping; Stimulus; System; Techniques; Testing; Time; Transgenic Organisms; Translating; vestibular pathway; Work; Zebrafish; ","Organization and function of hair cell afferent neurons","010809","AUD","Auditory System Study Section ","","S1","05","21234","11148","32382",""

Cognitive deficits are a core feature of schizophrenia and a major contributor to illness-related disability. This project examines sensory contributions to cognitive impairments in schizophrenia. Over previous grant cycles, we have demonstrated that individuals with schizophrenia show severe impairments in basic auditory and visual processes, such as the ability to match tones following brief delay, or to see pictures presented at low contrast. These deficits make it difficult for patients to interpret emotion based on tone of voice  or facial expression, and contribute to severe reading dysfunction in a subset of patients. Studies during the next grant period will investigate the causes of sensory dysfunction using EEG ('brain wave') based approaches as well as functional magnetic resonance imaging. In addition, we will evaluate other ways by which sensory deficits might lead to impaired function. Finally, we will evaluate the use of newly developed brain stimulation approaches to determine the degree to which they might be beneficial in reversing sensory-level abnormalities. If this approach is successful, it may open the way for novel, brain stimulation-based approaches in schizophrenia.","1858664; ","JAVITT, DANIEL C.;","MEINECKE, DOUGLAS L.","01/01/1993","02/29/2016","area striata; Auditory; Auditory system; base; Behavioral; Brain; Brain region; Cognitive deficits; cognitive function; cognitive process; Cognitive remediation; cohort; Complex; Contrast Sensitivity; Coupling; Detection; Diffusion; disability; Disease; Electroencephalography; Emotions; Evaluation; Event; Event-Related Potentials; Eye; Face; Facial Expression; Frequencies; Functional disorder; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; functional outcomes; Future; Generations; Glutamates; Grant; Health; Image; Impaired cognition; Impairment; improved; indexing; Individual; insight; Intervention; Lead; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; magnocellular; Measures; Modeling; neuromechanism; Neurons; neurophysiology; neuropsychiatry; novel; novel strategies; Patients; Pattern; Perceptual Closure; Phase; Population; Process; Reading; reading ability; response; Rest; Schizophrenia; Sensory; sensory cortex; Sensory Process; social cognition; Social Functioning; Speech; Stimulus; Stress; Therapeutic; therapy development; time use; tool; Transcranial magnetic stimulation; Visual; Visual evoked cortical potential; Visual Motion; visual process; visual processing; Visual system structure; Voice; ","Early Cortical Processing in Schizophrenia","049334","NPAS","Neural Basis of Psychopathology, Addictions and Sleep Disorders Study Section ","","","24","630592","196519","827111",""

Overcoming drug resistance is one of the greatest challenges in cancer treatment. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of resistance will offer innovative therapies to the military personnel diagnosed with lung cancer and increase survival. In this application using preclinical lung tumor models we propose to investigate the effect of platinum drugs on cellular machineries to produce drug resistance.

In this Fast-Track project, we have assembled the team of experts that can overcome these hurdles through hypothesis-driven process optimization and formulation development, culminating with a Phase IIa clinical trial, thereby positioning this novel non-cytotoxic epigenetic therapeutic for rapid movement through pivotal clinical trials, to NDA, and to patients in need.","1955952 (contact); 8410099; ","DESIMONE, JOSEPH  (contact); SAUNTHARARAJAH, YOGEN ;","WARREN, RONALD Q","04/24/2017","11/30/2017","Address; Adoption; Adverse event; Biological Availability; catalyst; Chemicals; Chemistry; Clinic; Clinical; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials; Coagulation Process; commercialization; cost; cost effective; Cytidine Deaminase; Cytidine Deaminase Inhibitor; Cytostatics; cytotoxic; cytotoxicity; Data; Decitabine; Development; Disease; DNA Modification Methylases; Dose; Drug Combinations; drug development; Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes; Effectiveness; Enzymes; Epigenetic Process; Erythrocytes; FDA approved; Fetal Hemoglobin; Formulation; Functional disorder; Generic Drugs; Genes; Globin; Goals; Hemoglobin; Hemolysis; Hour; Hydrogenation; hydroxyurea; improved; in utero; In Vitro; in vivo; Intestines; Ion-Exchange Chromatography Procedure; Laboratory Markers; Life; Liver; Marketing; meetings; Modeling; Modification; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Movement; Mus; Mutate; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases; novel; Oral; Papio; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacologic Substance; Pharmacology; Pharmacy facility; Phase; Phase I Clinical Trials; phase I trial; Placebos; Plasma; Polymers; Positioning Attribute; Powder dose form; Prevalence; Process; process optimization; Proteins; Rare Diseases; Reaction; reconstitution; Refractory; Reporting; Rhodium; Risk; S Phase; Safety; Scheme; Sickle Cell Anemia; Sickle Hemoglobin; Small Business Innovation Research Grant; Small Intestines; Staging; Stomach; Tablets; Tetrahydrouridine; Therapeutic; Time; United States National Institutes of Health; Uridine; ","A Novel, Non-Cytotoxic, Epigenetic Therapeutic for Sickle Cell Disease","135896","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","","","225000",""

The severity of lung injury remains a critical determinant of survival in patients suffering from ARDS and sepsis. A component of this lung injury is due to programmed death of lung cells by poorly understood pathways. This project seeks to identify and characterize a novel cell death pathway caused by a packaged delivery of the enzyme caspase-1 in microparticles. Our study will determine if caspase-1 released in submicroscopic packages may interact with lung cells to induce their death. Studies outlined here will study the formation and release, as well as targeting and cell uptake of these death packages. We expect this approach to uncover novel insights into ARDS mediated lung injury of septic patients and thus create new therapeutic opportunities to prevent and treat patients with ARDS and other inflammatory diseases.","9137437; ","SARKAR, ANASUYA ;","AGGARWAL, NEIL RAJ","07/01/2015","03/31/2020","Acute; Acute Lung Injury; Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome; Apoptosis; Apoptotic; Biology; Blood; Blood Vessels; CASP1 gene; Caspase; Cause of Death; Cell Communication; Cell Death; cell injury; Cell physiology; Cells; Cessation of life; Cleaved cell; Clinical; Complex; Critical Illness; Development; Disease; Distant; Encapsulated; Endothelial Cells; Enzymes; extracellular; Functional disorder; Goals; Immune; Immunologics; improved; Induction of Apoptosis; Inflammatory; injured; Injury; insight; Intensive Care Units; Interleukin-18; Knowledge; Link; Lung; lung injury; lung vascular injury; macrophage; Mediating; Modeling; Molecular; monocyte; Mononuclear; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Natural Immunity; NF-kappa B; novel; novel therapeutics; particle; Particulate; pathogen; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Patients; Phagocytes; Plasma; prevent; Process; Production; programs; public health relevance; Reaction; Regulation; Research; respiratory; response; Role; sensor; Sepsis; septic; Serum; Severities; Shock; Signal Transduction; Staging; Structure; Syndrome; System; Techniques; Testing; Therapeutic; Trauma; United States; uptake; Vascular Diseases; Vascular Endothelial Cell; Vesicle; Whole Blood; Work; ","Microparticulate Caspase-1 mediated Lung Injury.","124325","LIRR","Lung Injury, Repair, and Remodeling Study Section ","","","03","250000","135000","385000",""

Studies have shown that cancer patients who have cachexia often respond poorly to chemotherapy, are at a greater risk of infection and have a reduced life expectancy. Currently there is no effective way to treat cachexia. The work described in this proposal will help develop treatments for cachexia based on a hormone made by the body that increases appetite and stimulates muscle growth. Relieving the symptoms of cachexia will significantly improve a cancer patient's quality of life and decrease the need for hospitalizations, resulting in reduced healthcare costs.  ","11348945; ","SOLIMAN, TARIK ;","WEBER, PATRICIA A","04/24/2017","03/31/2019","absorption; acyl group; Address; Amino Acids; Animal Model; Animals; Anorexia; Anti-inflammatory; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; appetite loss; Appetite Stimulants; base; Biological Markers; Biological Sciences; Body Weight; Body Weight decreased; Cachexia; cancer cachexia; Cancer Patient; Canis familiaris; Cessation of life; cGMP production; chemotherapy; Chronic Disease; Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease; Clinic; Clinical; clinical candidate; college; Complex; Congestive Heart Failure; Consumption; Coupled; Cyclic GMP; Data; deacylation; Development; Dose; Drug Kinetics; Eating; efficacy testing; Energy Intake; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Fatigue; Fatty acid glycerol esters; FDA approved; food consumption; ghrelin; Growth; Half-Life; Health Care Costs; Home environment; Hormones; Hospitalization; Human; Immune response; immunogenicity; improved; increased appetite; Infection; Inflammatory; inflammatory marker; Intravenous infusion procedures; Laboratories; Lead; lean body mass; Life Expectancy; Limb structure; Malignant Neoplasms; Manufacturer Name; manufacturing process; Measures; Medicine; Methods; Modeling; Modification; Muscle; muscle form; Myocardium; outcome forecast; Patients; Peptides; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacodynamics; Pharmacotherapy; Phase; Plasma; Process; Property; Pump; Quality of life; Rattus; receptor binding; reduce symptoms; reduced muscle mass; Regimen; response; Risk; Rivers; Rodent Model; scale up; Self-Administered; skeletal muscle wasting; Small Business Innovation Research Grant; Somatotropin; Staging; subcutaneous; Syndrome; Testing; Therapeutic Effect; Therapeutic Uses; Time; Toxic effect; Toxicokinetics; Toxicology; Weight; Weight Gain; Work; ","Long-acting ghrelin for the treatment of cancer cachexia","213844","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","","","832924",""

Cognitive deficits are a core feature of schizophrenia and a major contributor to illness-related disability. This project examines sensory contributions to cognitive impairments in schizophrenia. Over previous grant cycles, we have demonstrated that individuals with schizophrenia show severe impairments in basic auditory and visual processes, such as the ability to match tones following brief delay, or to see pictures presented at low contrast. These deficits make it difficult for patients to interpret emotion based on tone of voice or facial expression, and contribute to severe reading dysfunction in a subset of patients. Studies during the next grant period will investigate the causes of sensory dysfunction using EEG ('brain wave') based approaches as well as functional magnetic resonance imaging. In addition, we will evaluate other ways by which sensory deficits might lead to impaired function. Finally, we will evaluate the use of newly developed brain stimulation approaches to determine the degree to which they might be beneficial in reversing sensory-level abnormalities. If this approach is successful, it may open the way for novel, brain stimulation-based approaches in schizophrenia.","1858664; ","JAVITT, DANIEL C.;","MEINECKE, DOUGLAS L.","01/01/1993","02/28/2018","area striata; Auditory; Auditory system; base; Behavioral; Brain; Brain region; Cognitive deficits; cognitive function; cognitive process; Cognitive remediation; cohort; Complex; Contrast Sensitivity; Coupling; Detection; Diffusion; disability; Disease; Electroencephalography; Emotions; Evaluation; Event; Event-Related Potentials; Eye; Face; Facial Expression; Frequencies; Functional disorder; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; functional outcomes; Future; Generations; Glutamates; Grant; Health; Image; Impaired cognition; Impairment; improved; indexing; Individual; insight; Intervention; Lead; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; magnocellular; Measures; Modeling; neuromechanism; Neurons; neurophysiology; neuropsychiatric disorder; novel; novel strategies; patient subsets; Patients; Pattern; Perceptual Closure; Phase; Population; Process; Reading; reading ability; response; Rest; Schizophrenia; Sensory; sensory cortex; Sensory Process; social cognition; Social Functioning; Speech; Stimulus; Stress; Therapeutic; therapy development; time use; tool; Transcranial magnetic stimulation; Visual; Visual evoked cortical potential; Visual Motion; visual process; visual processing; Visual system structure; Voice; ","Early Cortical Processing in Schizophrenia","049334","NPAS","Neural Basis of Psychopathology, Addictions and Sleep Disorders Study Section ","","","26","494340","132194","626534",""

The goal of this study is to identify the mechanisms that underlie smoking-induced up-regulation of AREG and AREG-mediated AER in the human airway epithelium, and develop the strategies to prevent or suppress smoking-induced COPD- relevant AER via inhibition of AREG up-regulation and signaling in airway BC stem/progenitor cells.","11442011; ","SHAYKHIEV, RENAT ;","POSTOW, LISA ","03/15/2016","02/29/2020","Affect; Air; airway epithelium; Amphiregulin; Architecture; Area; Basal Cell; Basal Cell Hyperplasia; base; Biochemical; Biological Assay; Cell Differentiation process; Cell surface; Cells; Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease; cigarette smoke; cigarette smoke-induced; cigarette smoking; Cilia; Data; Development; Disease; Elements; environmental tobacco smoke exposure; Epidermal Growth Factor; Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor; Epithelial; Generations; genome-wide; Goals; Health; Human; Hyperplasia; In Vitro; in vivo; inhibitor/antagonist; Knowledge; Ligands; Liquid substance; Lung diseases; Maintenance; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; Modeling; Molecular; mortality; Mucous body substance; Mus; Non-smoker; novel therapeutic intervention; novel therapeutics; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Permeability; Phenotype; prevent; receptor; Receptor Activation; Receptor Signaling; Role; Signal Induction; Signal Transduction; Site; Smoker; Smoking; Squamous Differentiation; Squamous Metaplasia; stem; Stem cells; targeted treatment; Testing; transcriptome; Transforming Growth Factor beta; Up-Regulation; ","Amphiregulin-driven COPD-relevant Remodeling of Human Airway Epithelium","127393","LCMI","Lung Cellular, Molecular, and Immunobiology Study Section ","","","02","250000","173750","423750",""

These diseases are linked to over 200 specific mutations in the BEST1 gene and they play an important role in efforts to study an array of blinding diseases, such as age related macular degeneration. Interrogation of genotype-specific disease mechanisms in bestrophinopathy is limited by the availability of representative disease models. The proposed work aims to address these challenges by applying advances in human gene-editing to improve the accuracy and accessibility of pluripotent stem cell derived ?disease-in-a-dish? models of bestrophinopathy.

Cognitive deficits are a core feature of schizophrenia and a major contributor to illness-related disability. This project examines sensory contributions to cognitive impairments in schizophrenia. Over previous grant cycles, we have demonstrated that individuals with schizophrenia show severe impairments in basic auditory and visual processes, such as the ability to match tones following brief delay, or to see pictures presented at low contrast. These deficits make it difficult for patients to interpret emotion based on tone of voice  or facial expression, and contribute to severe reading dysfunction in a subset of patients. Studies during the next grant period will investigate the causes of sensory dysfunction using EEG ('brain wave') based approaches as well as functional magnetic resonance imaging. In addition, we will evaluate other ways by which sensory deficits might lead to impaired function. Finally, we will evaluate the use of newly developed brain stimulation approaches to determine the degree to which they might be beneficial in reversing sensory-level abnormalities. If this approach is successful, it may open the way for novel, brain stimulation-based approaches in schizophrenia.","1858664; ","JAVITT, DANIEL C.;","MEINECKE, DOUGLAS L.","01/01/1993","02/28/2018","area striata; Auditory; Auditory system; base; Behavioral; Brain; Brain region; Cognitive; Cognitive deficits; cognitive function; Cognitive remediation; cohort; Complex; Contrast Sensitivity; Coupling; Detection; Diffusion; disability; Disease; Electroencephalography; Emotions; Evaluation; Event; Event-Related Potentials; Eye; Face; Facial Expression; Frequencies; Functional disorder; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; functional outcomes; Future; Generations; Glutamates; Grant; Health; Image; Impaired cognition; Impairment; improved; indexing; Individual; insight; Intervention; Lead; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; magnocellular; Measures; Modeling; neuromechanism; Neurons; neurophysiology; neuropsychiatry; novel; novel strategies; Patients; Pattern; Perceptual Closure; Phase; Population; Process; Reading; reading ability; response; Rest; Schizophrenia; Sensory; sensory cortex; Sensory Process; social cognition; Social Functioning; Speech; Stimulus; Stress; Therapeutic; therapy development; time use; tool; Transcranial magnetic stimulation; Visual; Visual evoked cortical potential; Visual Motion; visual process; visual processing; Visual system structure; Voice; ","Early Cortical Processing in Schizophrenia","049334","NPAS","Neural Basis of Psychopathology, Addictions and Sleep Disorders Study Section ","","","23","575920","144418","720338",""

A major goal of the proposed studies is to determine the mechanisms that lead to chronic gastrointestinal pain in deployed Gulf War Veterans. The proposed studies will provide: (1) an innovative model to explain chronic gastrointestinal pain in Gulf War Veterans that were deployed into war zones; and (2) a novel way to treat them. Indeed, our model, which holds that the above gastrointestinal pain is due to altered miRNA signaling is supported by our preliminary data. Given that there are currently no specific treatments for these disorders, and that current symptomatic approaches are far from ideal, proof of principle of our model would be an extremely important advance as it would not only have a beneficial impact on the health of many thousands of our Veterans, but also it would substantially reduce the many negative economic effects of this ailment on the VA health care system.","10281862; ","ZHOU, QI QI ;","","04/01/2017","03/31/2021","abstracting; AMPA Receptors; base; Cells; Chronic; Chronic Disease; Colon; combat; Data; Development; diagnostic biomarker; Disease; Down-Regulation; Economics; effective therapy; epigenetic regulation; Epithelial Cells; Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders; ganglion cell; gastrointestinal; Gene Expression; Gene Targeting; Glutamate Receptor; glutamatergic signaling; Glutamates; Goals; Gulf War; Health; Healthcare Systems; Human; Hypersensitivity; in vivo; Injection of therapeutic agent; innovation; Lead; Mediating; Methods; MicroRNAs; Modeling; Molecular; Morbidity - disease rate; N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors; N-Methylaspartate; Nociception; novel; Opioid; Opioid Receptor; Pain; Pain Disorder; Pathway interactions; Persian Gulf; Population; public health relevance; Rattus; receptor expression; Receptor Signaling; Research; Role; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; small molecule; Spinal Ganglia; Stream; Techniques; Testing; Therapeutic; Tissues; Transfection; Up-Regulation; Veterans; Visceral; War; ","Mechanisms of Gulf War Illness","001477","SPLD","Special Emphasis - Research on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses ","","","01","","","",""

Cognitive deficits are a core feature of schizophrenia and a major contributor to illness-related disability. This project examines sensory contributions to cognitive impairments in schizophrenia. Over previous grant cycles, we have demonstrated that individuals with schizophrenia show severe impairments in basic auditory and visual processes, such as the ability to match tones following brief delay, or to see pictures presented at low contrast. These deficits make it difficult for patients to interpret emotion based on tone of voice or facial expression, and contribute to severe reading dysfunction in a subset of patients. Studies during the next grant period will investigate the causes of sensory dysfunction using EEG ('brain wave') based approaches as well as functional magnetic resonance imaging. In addition, we will evaluate other ways by which sensory deficits might lead to impaired function.

This training program will build upon previous success in recruiting, engaging, and mentoring successful scientists who can advance the field in order to reduce the burden of child mental disorders. This T32 is important because: (1) of the need to improve our understanding of pathogenesis, treatment, and implementation in child mental health disorders; (2) postdoctoral training is strong predictor of eventual academic success; and (3) of the need to replenish the pool of NIH-funded researchers with new cohorts of early career scientists.","1894913; ","BRENT, DAVID A.;","HILL, LAUREN D.","01/01/2017","06/30/2017","Adolescent; Child; Mental Health; Research; ","Child & Adolescent Mental Health Research","018951","","","","S1","26","9480","758","10238",""
