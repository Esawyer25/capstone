However, whether [a] different vaccine types give equivalent or different levels of memory T cell subsets is unknown, and [b] whether these vaccines will be equally protective against newly emerging highly virulent clinical strains is equally unaddressed. The purpose of this proposed R01 study is to begin to answer these questions. We will start by vaccinating mice with four representative vaccine ?types? and assess their ability to generate memory T cells over time. We will then use our cell sorter [conveniently within our P3 facility], to isolate T cell subsets and study them further in terms of their expression of functional, metabolic, and phenotypic markers. Finally, we will determine if memory immunity induced by each vaccine is equally effective against four clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis which are all highly virulent but which differ in terms of their fitness [inhibition by BCG] and in their ability to induce unbeneficial regulatory T cell responses.","10534189; ","HENAO-TAMAYO, MARCELA I;","EICHELBERG, KATRIN ","08/10/2017","07/31/2021","Address; Adjuvant; Aerosols; Animal Model; Animals; Attenuated; Bacillus (bacterium); base; BCG Vaccine; Biological Assay; Biological Markers; Cell Separation; Cells; Cessation of life; Child; Chimeric Proteins; Clinical; clinical development; Colorado; Core Facility; cytokine; Development; Elements; Equation; exhaustion; falls; fitness; Flow Cytometry; Fright; Generations; Genus Mycobacterium; Head; Heart; HIV; HIV Seropositivity; Immunity; immunogenicity; Individual; Infant; Laboratories; Laboratory Research; Literature; Measures; Memory; memory CD4 T lymphocyte; Metabolic; Metabolic Marker; Modeling; Multi-Drug Resistance; Mus; mutant; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Nature; novel vaccines; Organ; Outcome; Outcome Study; pathogen; Phenotype; phenotypic biomarker; Population; programs; Proteins; Publications; Pulmonary Pathology; rBCG; Recombinants; Regulatory T-Lymphocyte; Resistance; response; Series; Speed; Standardization; Stem cells; T memory cell; T-Lymphocyte; T-Lymphocyte Subsets; Techniques; Testing; Time; Training; Tuberculosis; tuberculosis immunity; Tuberculosis Vaccines; United States National Institutes of Health; Universities; Vaccinated; Vaccination; vaccination against tuberculosis; vaccine candidate; vaccine evaluation; Vaccines; virtual; Virulence; Virulent; Work; World Health Organization; ","Vaccine induced memory immunity in tuberculosis","127475","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","01","250000","130000","380000",""

Current treatments are ineffective, such that 98% of patients will eventually die of their disease. Most deaths occur due to the metastatic process by which cancer cells spread to distant sites in the body. New therapies that activate the anti-tumor potential of the immune system have shown promise in other cancers, but have been associated with side effects. We have identified a novel means to augment immune system activation which will avoid adverse effects and will be an improved therapy for pancreatic cancer.

We have developed standard mouse models and special humanized mouse models, where cells from patients can be studied in mice, to study IL10R deficiency. We propose to use gene transfer into patient HSCs to restore IL10R signaling and provide an alternative treatment option for these patients.

In order to completel understand the role that physical activity plays in making healthy lifestyle change, it is critical that we validate the impact of activity using an objective measure. In addition, current studies suggest that decreasing prolonged sitting bouts may be as important as or even more important than participating in planned bouts of moderate intensity activity. Therefore, we propose to examine the impact of a modified version of the GLB program, which will focus on decreasing sedentary behavior. The results of this project will provide information regarding best options for physical activity within lifestyle intervention programs, focusing first on verifying the current rle of physical activity in lifestyle intervention using an objective measure, and second on examining an alternative intervention option for translation efforts.","1860058; ","KRISKA, ANDREA M;","BURCH, HENRY B","09/01/2014","07/31/2018","Accelerometer; Address; Age; arm; base; behavior change; Behavioral; Blood Pressure; Body Weight Changes; Body Weight decreased; Cardiovascular Diseases; cardiovascular disorder risk; Communities; community center; community setting; Comorbidity; Control Groups; cost; Data Reporting; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetes prevention; diabetes prevention program; Epidemic; Equilibrium; fasting glucose; Future; General Population; Glycosylated hemoglobin A; Goals; Health Benefit; healthy lifestyle; improved; Incidence; Individual; innovation; instrument; Insulin; Intervention; intervention effect; intervention program; Life Style; lifestyle intervention; Light Exercise; Lipids; Literature; Measures; Metabolic syndrome; Modeling; Moderate Activity; Moderate Exercise; Motivation; Movement; Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; Obesity; Outcome Measure; Participant; Patient Self-Report; Physical activity; Physical assessment; Physical Function; Play; Prediabetes syndrome; prevent; Prevention; Preventive Intervention; primary outcome; programs; prospective; Public Health; public health relevance; Publishing; Quality of life; Randomized; Recruitment Activity; Reporting; Research; Research Design; Risk Factors; Role; secondary outcome; sedentary; sedentary lifestyle; Study models; Subgroup; success; Time; Translations; Variant; Visit; waist circumference; Weight; Weight Gain; ","Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior Change; Impact on Lifestyle Intervention Effects for Diabetes Translation","100933","ZDK1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","04","481308","240409","721717",""

Crisis, especially if prolonged, can have several negative health implications. It is known to lead to declines in cognitive performance and attentional impairment, and is a known stressor of the onset of PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder), an anxiety disorder widely recognized as having physiological concomitants. These challenges make the study of the relationship between protracted crisis exposure and social, psychological, and affective reactions in people vital from a public health perspective.  Recognizing these needs, there have been efforts in the recent past where crisis responders and non- government agencies have incorporated mental health services into disaster response. However, it is well-known that survivors benefit best from early diagnosis, wherein treatment may range from brief interventions in the weeks and months after disaster exposure, to referral to mental health treatment if symptoms do not remit with brief interventions. In fact, the likelihood of achieving full recovery declines as the illness lengthens. Additionally, the diagnosis process has challenges as well: due to the inaccessibility of disaster survivors to mental health services, broad community-level diagnoses rely on government or agency administered surveys. However, typically there are large temporal gaps in which these surveys are administered and due to their observations being mostly retrospective, the surveys lack the contextualization that is needed to associate the manifested affective concerns to actual circumstances people face. This also makes it difficult for concerned agencies to track and identify risk factors that may be associated with post-traumatic mental illness, or to develop effective intervention programs. Complementing these surveys with near real-time information, such as from social media, about people's behavioral reactions seems to be an effective way of empowering people with tools and platforms that can provide them with psychological and emotional support in the context of catastrophic disasters.  In the light of the above public healt relevance, the goal of this project is to examine the potential of online social networks and socia media as an unobtrusive lens on the behavior of crisis-laden communities, and identify factors indicative of their vulnerability or predisposition to post-traumatic stress and anxiety.

The disease of interest, Rheumatoid Arthritis, is the most common inflammatory joint disease at the VA (67,000 patients) and causes significant disability- particularly among veterans, in whom the severity of disease is often greater. Epidemiology research has demonstrated that low body weight is associated with increased risk of disability, fracture, and joint damage in RA. However, the long-term effects of disease on weight have not been clarified nor have the direct effects of low lean mass (muscle) on bone structure, and an increased long-term risk of osteoporosis and joint damage.

Such symptoms are harmful enough in themselves, but they can lead to incontinence, infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, and psychological distress. The objective of this program is to carry out epidemiologic studies to determine biological and behavioral factors that can lead to lower urinary tract symptoms and related illnesses, and to find ways to prevent progression to clinical symptoms and more serious complications.

GERD decreases the quality of life, increases the risk for other co-morbidities, and increases the likelihood that a Veteran wll undergo costly diagnostic endoscopy. Obesity is associated with significantly increased risk for GERD and Veterans are disproportionately overweight and obese. In an obese cohort, we have observed that total sugar intake strongly correlated with GERD symptoms, and that reducing total sugar intake and glycemic load led to complete resolution of GERD symptoms and medication use in all 36 obese subjects who had symptoms or used medications at study onset. This effect was not dependent upon weight loss. We will therefore deploy a randomized controlled clinical trial to determine if reduction in total and/or simple dietary carbohydrate wil reduce subjective and objective measures of GERD in Veterans and identify the mechanism involved.","1880061; ","NISWENDER, KEVIN D;","","07/01/2015","06/30/2020","21 year old; Acids; Address; Adenocarcinoma; Adult; African American; Alcohols; American; Body mass index; Body Weight decreased; Caffeine; Carbohydrates; caucasian American; cell motility; Chocolate; Chronic; Clinical Data; cohort; Comorbidity; Complex; cost; Data; Diagnosis; Diagnostic; Diet; Dietary Carbohydrates; Dietary Factors; Dietary Fiber; Dietary intake; Dietary Intervention; Dyspepsia; Endoscopy; Epidemic; epidemiologic data; Esophageal; Esophagitis; experience; Fat-Restricted Diet; Fatty acid glycerol esters; Food; Frequencies; Gastric Acid; Gastrins; Gastroenterology; Gastroesophageal reflux disease; Gastrointestinal Diseases; gastrointestinal disorder diagnosis; Gastrointestinal Hormones; Genus Mentha; ghrelin; Glucagon; glucagon-like peptide 1; Guidelines; Heartburn; High Fat Diet; Histamine-2 Receptor Antagonist; Hormonal; improved; Inferior esophageal sphincter structure; Inpatients; Insulin; insulin sensitivity; Intake; Investigation; Measures; Mediating; men; novel; Nutritional; Obesity; Odds Ratio; Outpatients; Overweight; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Physiological; Prevalence; primary outcome; Proton Pump Inhibitors; public health relevance; Quality of life; Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials; Randomized Controlled Trials; Reflux; Reporting; Resolution; response; Risk; Risk Factors; saturated fat; Stomach; sugar; Symptoms; System; Testing; Time; Total Sugar; Veterans; Visit; Weight; Woman; ","Dietary carbohydrate effects on GERD in obese Veterans:nutritional or hormonal?","001009","CLNB","Clinical Trials - B ","","","03","","","",""

The cognitive loss and dementia caused by AD lead to increasing healthcare cost escalation and human suffering. Therefore, a better understanding of AD pathogenesis is of particular importance. Our recent findings link ApoE4 genotype-specific changes in brain phospholipid homeostasis to the ApoE4-dependent increased susceptibility to develop sporadic AD. In this application, we propose to further characterize molecular mechanism(s) underlying ApoE4-genotype specific changes in brain synj1/PIP2 pathways through miRNA modulation. These studies will advance our understanding of the importance of ApoE4-induced brain phospholipid dysregulation in development of neurodegenerative processes and cognitive deficits. Our research could benefit the aging research field and guide future development of therapeutic interventions for AD targeted at brain lipid homeostasis and ApoE functions.","10345751; ","CAI, DONGMING ;","","07/01/2017","06/30/2021","3' Untranslated Regions; Aftercare; Age; Age-Months; aged; Aging; Alleles; Alzheimer's Disease; Apolipoprotein E; apolipoprotein E-3; apolipoprotein E-4; behavior test; Binding; Binding Sites; Bioinformatics; Biological Assay; Brain; brain tissue; Candidate Disease Gene; Cognitive deficits; cognitive function; Data; Data Set; Dementia; design; Development; Diagnosis; differential expression; Elderly; Enzymes; Experimental Designs; Functional disorder; Future; General Population; Genes; Genetic; genetic risk factor; Genotype; Health Care Costs; hippocampal morphometry; Hippocampus (Brain); Homeostasis; Human; Impaired cognition; improved; in vivo; Intraventricular Injections; knock-down; Laboratories; LDL-Receptor Related Protein 1; Lead; Learning; Link; Lipids; Literature; Luciferases; Measures; Memory; Messenger RNA; MicroRNAs; mild cognitive impairment; Molecular; Morphology; mRNA Expression; mRNA Stability; mRNA Transcript Degradation; Mus; Nerve Degeneration; Neurons; novel therapeutics; overexpression; Pathogenesis; Pathogenicity; Pathway interactions; Pattern; Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate; Phospholipids; Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases; Physiologic pulse; Population; Predisposition; Process; Protein Biosynthesis; protein expression; Protein Isoforms; Proteins; receptor; Regulation; Research; RNA; Role; Sampling; Secondary to; Seeds; Signal Pathway; Site-Directed Mutagenesis; Slice; Structure; Synapses; synaptojanin; Techniques; therapeutic development; Therapeutic Intervention; therapy development; Transcript; Transfection; Transgenic Organisms; Validation; Vertebral column; Viral; Western Blotting; ","MicroRNA Regulation of Phospholipid Homeostasis in Alzheimer's Disease Pathogenesis","003380","NURD","Neurobiology D ","","A2","01","","","",""

Complete, acute loss of placental hormones occurs with preterm birth, representing more than 10% of US births. The outcome of the proposed preclinical experiments on allopregnanolone?a potent neuroactive steroid made by the placenta?will be important in determining how this hormone or related compounds may be used to prevent or ameliorate abnormal fetal brain development when placental hormones are altered or lost.

The biological significance of U2AF1 in HSC function in health and disease is not well understood; from preliminary data we propose that U2AF1 may play a key role in regulating the ability of HSCs to properly differentiate into new blood cells during inflammation, with mutations impairing the ability of HSCs to limit the negative effects of inflammation on their function. Hence, understanding the importance of U2AF1 in HSC function during inflammatory stress will provide important opportunities to identify its contribution to maintaining normal blood production, and potential ways to correct HSC dysfunction and the potential for evolution to MDS in the context of U2AF1 mutation.","14074704; ","RABE, JENNIFER L;","CHANG, HENRY ","02/01/2001","","Acute; Acute Myelocytic Leukemia; Adaptor Signaling Protein; Address; Affect; Alleles; Alternative Splicing; Anti-inflammatory; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Biological; Blood; Blood Cells; Bone Marrow; Cell Compartmentation; Cell Differentiation process; Cell Lineage; Cell physiology; Cells; cellular transduction; Chronic; Chronic stress; Clinical; Complex; cytokine; cytopenia; Data; Development; Disease; Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes; Epigenetic Process; Event; Evolution; Feedback; Functional disorder; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Transcription; Goals; Health; Hematologic Neoplasms; Hematological Disease; Hematopoiesis; Hematopoietic; hematopoietic stem cell fate; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Hematopoietic stem cells; Human; human stem cells; Hyperactive behavior; Immune; Immune signaling; Impairment; In Vitro; in vitro Assay; in vivo; Individual; Infection; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Inflammatory Response; Injury; insight; Interleukin-1; Investigation; knock-down; Lead; Link; Lupus; macrophage; Malignant - descriptor; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; Messenger RNA; Metabolic; mouse model; mutant; Mutate; Mutation; MyD88 protein; Myelogenous; Myeloid Cells; Myeloid Progenitor Cells; Obesity; Output; overexpression; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Patients; Phenotype; Play; Predisposition; Production; programs; Recording of previous events; response; Rheumatoid Arthritis; Risk; RNA Splicing; Role; self renewing cell; self-renewal; Series; Shapes; Signal Transduction; small hairpin RNA; Somatic Mutation; Stem cells; Stress; System; targeted treatment; Testing; Tetanus Helper Peptide; Therapeutic Intervention; transcriptome sequencing; Transgenic Mice; ","Role of RNA splicing factor U2AF1 in regulating hematopoietic stem cell inflammation responses.","138754","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","31066","","31066",""

The majority of HIV-1 infected persons who cease therapy have rapid viremic relapse due to the presence of long- lived HIV-1 reservoirs. The mechanism(s) by which these reservoirs are seeded, maintained, and are subject to sustained virologic remission or ultimately rebound, upon interuption of antiretroviral therapy is not understood. A detailed understanding of the factors that dictate HIV suppression or rebound, in the absence of antiretroviral therapy, is critical to develop approaches to therapeutically foster HIV-1 remission in patients on long-term antiretroviral therapy. Thus, we propose detailed studies to define the impact of early antiretroviral therapy on virologic and immunologic outcomes that are relevant to achieving HIV remission and durable virus control after the interuption of such therapy. These studies encompass multi-disciplinary collaborations, to have the greatest breadth of investigation, and ultimately the greatest scientific impact. Our proposed investigations include analytic studies in both HIV-infected adult and pediatric patients. We will also conduct parallel studies in non-human primates, including the pre-clinical evaluation of novel eradication therapeutics.","10125061; ","WHITNEY, JAMES BURTON;","KUO, LILLIAN S.","08/11/2017","07/31/2022","Adult; Aftercare; antiretroviral therapy; Bioinformatics; Biological Markers; Cells; Child; Clinical; cohort; Disease remission; Early treatment; Employee Strikes; Equilibrium; Fostering; Goals; HIV; HIV Infections; HIV-1; Immunity; Immunologic Factors; Immunologics; Individual; Interdisciplinary Study; Interruption; Investigation; Location; mathematical model; memory CD4 T lymphocyte; Mississippi; Molecular; nonhuman primate; novel; Outcome; outcome prediction; Patients; pediatric patients; Persons; Plasma; pre-clinical; predict clinical outcome; Predictive Factor; Probability; programs; Regimen; Relapse; research clinical testing; Site; SIV; Therapeutic; Viral; Viral reservoir; Viremia; virology; Virus; ","Viral dynamics of rebound and control following early treatment of HIV/SIV","131365","ZAI1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","1165904","329929","1495833",""

Currently, there is no method to prevent these diseases or to slow their progression. This group of diseases is characterized by neuropathology of Lewy bodies that consist of alpha-synuclein aggregates. Alpha-synuclein (SNCA) is implicated in the genetics and pathogenesis of PD. The proposed project aims to investigate the genetic basis underlying the regulation of SNCA expression in relation to susceptibility to the spectrum of Lewy body neuropathologies. The results will provide a better understanding of the genetic factors and molecular mechanisms underlying 'synucleinopathies' and will advance the identification of valuable pathways for developing therapies targeting SNCA expression.","9504049; ","CHIBA-FALEK, ORNIT ;","SUTHERLAND, MARGARET L","09/25/2013","07/31/2018","Address; Affect; Alleles; Alpha Cell; alpha synuclein; alpha synuclein gene; Alternative Splicing; Alzheimer's Disease; Anatomy; Animal Model; Area; Autopsy; base; Bioinformatics; Brain; brain tissue; Candidate Disease Gene; candidate marker; case control; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell Death; Cells; cohort; Complement; Complex; Control Groups; cost; Data; deep sequencing; Deposition; Development; Diagnosis; Disease; Disease susceptibility; experimental study; Frequencies; Gene Expression; Genes; Genetic; genetic association; genetic element; Genetic Polymorphism; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; genetic risk factor; genetic variant; genome wide association study; Genotype; Goals; Haplotypes; Health; Human; Individual; interest; Knowledge; laser capture microdissection; Lead; Lewy Bodies; Lewy Body Dementia; Lewy Body Disease; Measures; Messenger RNA; Methods; Modeling; Molecular; mRNA Expression; Neurodegenerative Disorders; Neuroglia; Neurologic; neuron loss; Neurons; neuropathology; novel; Observational Study; Outcome Study; overexpression; Parkinson Disease; Pathogenesis; Pathogenicity; Pathologic; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Patients; Phylogenetic Analysis; Predisposition; prevent; protein aggregate; protein expression; Proteins; prototype; public health relevance; Publishing; Regulation; Reporter; Reporting; Research; Resolution; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Risk; RNA Splicing; Role; segregation; Societies; Structure; synuclein; synucleinopathy; System; targeted treatment; Techniques; Testing; therapeutic target; therapy development; Transcript; Trees; Untranslated RNA; Variant; ","Lewy body neuropathologies and SNCA gene: variants expression and splicing","085011","MNG","Molecular Neurogenetics Study Section ","","","05","231427","131913","363340",""

These disparities are not due to increased risk behavior among YBMSM, but seem to result because YBMSM who are sexually active are more likely to encounter infectious partners. YBMSM are more likely to be HIV+, and less likely to be on treatment for HIV, and to have undetectable HIV viral loads (VLs). When HIV+ men achieve an undetectable VL, their own health improves, and they are also less infectious to others. Getting to that point requires that HIV+ individuals go through a number of steps of engaging in the continuum of care (CC), such as obtaining health care for HIV, and taking medications as prescribed. The goal of this project is to develop, implement, and test a community-level intervention to build and mobilize communities of YBMSM (ages 18-29) to support HIV+ men about engaging in the CC. The intervention is called United Black Element+.

Yet, there is widespread consensus that adequate treatments for negative symptoms are not available. Improved understanding of the neurobiology of negative symptoms is needed to inform the development of better therapeutic options to target these symptoms. Research aims of the current project are to combine clinical neuroimaging tools to generate new knowledge concerning the relationship between negative symptoms and reward-related brain alterations in schizophrenia.

All current FDA-approved L-asparaginases have significant immunological and toxic side effects, particularly for adults, because they (i) are bacterial enzymes, and (ii) have L-glutaminase co-activity. We will replace the bacterial enzymes with human-like enzymes, with two significant benefits: (i) they will be less immunogenic, and (ii) they will be devoid of the toxicity-causing L-glutaminase co-activity. We also will delineate factors that determine whether a patient will respond or not to this unique drug. The combination of a safer L-asparaginase drug (which will permit its use by the adult VA patient population), with a screen that can predict which patients would benefit most from this treatment, will impact the treatment of veterans with ALL, and will also expand the use of L-asparaginase to veterans with other blood cancers, and possibly, select solid tumors.","6167160; ","LAVIE, ARNON ;","","04/01/2013","06/30/2021","Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia; Address; Adult; Adult Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia; Adverse effects; Antineoplastic Agents; asparaginase; Asparagine; Biological Markers; cancer cell; Cancer cell line; Cancer Patient; cancer therapy; Cavia; Cell Culture Techniques; cell killing; Childhood; Clinic; Clinical; clinical efficacy; Companions; CRISPR/Cas technology; design; Development; Disease; Distant; Drug Kinetics; Drug usage; efficacy study; Engineering; Enzymes; Exhibits; experimental study; FDA approved; Funding; Genes; Genetic Screening; Glutaminase; Glutamine; Goals; Hematopoietic Neoplasms; Homologous Gene; Human; Image; immunogenic; immunogenicity; Immunologics; improved; in vivo; individualized medicine; Killings; leukemia treatment; Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Acute, L1; Malignant Neoplasms; Medicine; Methods; Molecular; Molecular Profiling; Mus; Nature; novel; novel therapeutics; patient population; patient subsets; Patients; personalized medicine; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacodynamics; Population; pre-clinical; predicting response; predictive marker; premature; Preparation; prevent; Property; Regimen; Research; Resistance; response; response biomarker; Safety; Sampling; Side; Solid Neoplasm; Source; success; Technology; Testing; tool; Toxic effect; Treatment outcome; Variant; Veterans; Vision; Work; Xenograft Model; ","Development of Human Asparaginase for Cancer Therapy","001919","HEMA","Hematology ","","","05","","","",""

The current outbreak in South and Central America has been associated with neurological complications, including Guillain-Barre syndrome and cases of microcephaly. The regions involved in the current ZIKV outbreak are known to be endemic for dengue virus (DENV), and preexisting immunity to DENV has been shown to enhance infections with other flaviviruses. In this project, we will characterize interactions between ZIKV and antibodies that recognize DENV. Additionally, we will examine the ability of preexisting DENV antibodies to enhance ZIKV infection in primary human immune cells.

Although effective screening tests are widely available for all three cancers, many women do not adhere to screening guidelines. Thirty-two rural counties in northwest Ohio and northeast Indiana share similar socioeconomically underserved populations of predominately white women who have elevated mortality rates and lower screening rates for these cancers. The goal of this proposal is to test the comparative effectiveness of a tailored interactive computer program delivered via DVD (TIDVD) vs. a TIDVD + telephone-based patient navigation (PN) intervention (TNI) vs Usual Care (UC) to increase guideline-based screening rates for BC, CC, and CRC among women age 50 to 74 living in these rural counties of Ohio and Indiana. If found to be cost effective, either or both interventions have the potential to be immediately disseminated to increase BC, CC, and CRC screening rates and ultimately reduce cancer disparities for underserved rural women.","1864817; 1878622 (contact); ","CHAMPION, VICTORIA LEE; PASKETT, ELECTRA D.

A fundamental clinical problem in individuals with low back pain is the significant alteration in movement patterns that restrict lumbar spine motion. This is particularly true for patients with fear of re-injury with movement (i.e., kinesiophobia). Accordingly, we propose a novel approach that uses a whole body video game environment to improve spinal motion and decrease expectation of pain and harm. The use of a gaming environment is an innovative approach to address low back pain that can have a significant impact on public health by developing technology to improve treatment access and reduce long-term disability.","6191092; 6875076 (contact); ","FRANCE, CHRISTOPHER R; THOMAS, JAMES S (contact);","MARDEN, SUSAN F.","08/10/2017","05/31/2022","Accelerometer; Acute; Address; Adoption; Aftercare; arm; Back Pain; Chronic; Chronic low back pain; chronic pain; Clinical; Connective Tissue; Control Groups; cost; Data; design; Development; disability; Environment; Exhibits; Expectancy; expectation; follow-up; Fright; Goals; Health Services Accessibility; Hip region structure; Immersion Investigative Technique; improved; Individual; Individual Differences; Injury; innovation; Intervention; Intractable Pain; Knee; Laboratories; Lead; Low Back Pain; Maintenance; Measures; Medical; Monitor; Motion; Movement; Muscle; novel strategies; Outcome; Pain; Pain Disorder; Participant; Patients; Pattern; Persistent pain; Phase; phase I trial; phase II trial; Physicians; Play; Public Health; Randomized; Recovery; restoration; Risk; Shoulder; Spinal; standard of care; Standardization; Technology; Testing; Time; United States; United States National Institutes of Health; Vertebral column; Video Games; virtual; virtual reality; Visit; ","Virtual Immersive Gaming to Optimize Recovery in Low Back Pain","088417","BMIO","Behavioral Medicine, Interventions and Outcomes Study Section ","","A1","01","392111","199977","592088",""

The proposed study will offer preliminary data to further clarify the value of population-based prevention efforts to ensure early iron sufficiency, which will inform longitudinal studies designed to assess the developmental timing and malleability of brain-based iron deficiency during childhood.","10890292; ","PRITCHARD, ALISON ;","LIU, GUOYING ","08/10/2017","07/31/2018","Accidents; Address; Adolescence; Advertisements; Affect; Age; Age-Months; anatomic imaging; Animal Model; Attention; Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; base; Base of the Brain; Behavior; Behavioral; biomarker development; Blood; Brain; Brain region; Child; Childhood; cognitive control; cognitive development; cognitive system; Communities; Corpus striatum structure; cost; Data; deprivation; Development; Developmental Course; Disease; Dopamine; Eligibility Determination; Emotions; Ensure; Etiology; Evaluation; experience; externalizing behavior; frontal lobe; Goals; gray matter; Gray unit of radiation dose; Growth; Human; Imaging Techniques; Impairment; indexing; infancy; Injury; Iron; iron deficiency; language perception; Link; Longitudinal prospective study; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Magnetism; Maps; Measures; Mediating; Medical; Medical Records; Metabolism; Methodology; myelination; neuroimaging; neuropsychological; Neuropsychology; Neurotransmitters; nonhuman primate; Norepinephrine; Occupational; Oppositional Defiant Disorder; Outcome; Parents; Participant; Peripheral; peripheral blood; Pharmaceutical Preparations; population based; Positioning Attribute; Predisposition; Prevalence; Prevention; Problem behavior; Process; Productivity; public health relevance; Recording of previous events; Recruitment Activity; Research; Research Design; Research Domain Criteria; Resolution; Risk Factors; Role; School-Age Population; Services; social; Societies; Special Education; success; symptomatology; Systems Development; teacher; Techniques; Time Study; Tissues; ultra high resolution; Visual Perception; ","Role of Peripheral & Brain Iron in the Development of Attention & Cognitive Control","023359","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","01","150000","90798","240798",""

However, it suffers from low specificity to malignancy and limited sensitivity to small lesions. In this project, we pair with an industrial partner to develop the next-generation of ultrasound for oncological imaging. Our proposed approach builds on recent discoveries with innovative technological advancement to develop an ultrasound imaging technique which can detect cancer?s fingerprint through detection of malignant microvascular angiogenesis. To do this, we will exploit advances in computational hardware and data processing to achieve super-resolution images of microvessels in-vivo, at resolutions an order of magnitude better than possible with commercial systems, at clinically relevant depths, with clinically translatable acoustic parameters, and with FDA approved contrast agents.","9239482 (contact); 12284990; ","DAYTON, PAUL A (contact); PINTON, GIANMARCO ;","BAKER, HOUSTON ","08/10/2017","07/31/2022","3-Dimensional; Acoustics; Address; Anatomy; angiogenesis; Angiography; Atherosclerosis; base; Blood Vessels; Brain; Breast; Buffers; Cancer Detection; cancer imaging; Cancer Model; Clinic; Clinical; clinical application; Clinical Research; clinically relevant; clinically translatable; Collaborations; Computer software; computerized data processing; contrast enhanced; contrast imaging; Contrast Media; cost; Data; data acquisition; density; design; design and construction; Detection; Development; Diagnostic; Dimensions; Engineering; Exhibits; FDA approved; Fingerprint; FPS-FES Oncogene; Frequencies; Hour; Human; human disease; Image; image processing; imaging approach; imaging modality; Imaging Techniques; Imaging technology; improved; in vivo; Industrialization; innovation; Lesion; Malignant - descriptor; Malignant Neoplasms; Methods; Microscopy; Morphology; Motion; Motivation; Nature; new growth; new technology; next generation; North Carolina; novel; novel strategies; oncology; optical imaging; Paper; Performance; portability; preclinical study; Prostate; Public Health; Publishing; rapid growth; Rattus; Research Personnel; Resolution; response; Rodent; Rodent Model; Safety; sarcoma; Scientist; Seminal; Sensitivity and Specificity; Slice; Specificity; standard of care; Stream; System; targeted biomarker; Techniques; Technology; Testing; Three-Dimensional Image; Three-Dimensional Imaging; Thyroid Gland; Time; Tissues; Transducers; Translating; tumor; tumor growth; Ultrasonography; Universities; vasa vasorum; vector; Work; Wound Healing; ","High Frame Rate 3-D Super Resolution Ultrasound Microvascular Imaging","220681","MEDI","Medical Imaging Study Section ","","","01","438021","113643","551664",""

One of the most promising approaches for glioblastoma therapy is the targeting of deregulated molecules that drive tumor malignancy. However, it has been shown that several molecules are simultaneously deregulated in any given single tumor. Targeting them altogether with pharmacological drugs is extremely difficult because many molecules have no known drugs and because combining several drugs leads to high toxicity. To overcome this problem, we propose to use a new class of naturally occurring nucleic acids called microRNAs that can target several molecules at the same time. We propose to identify such molecules, study their mechanisms of action and effects, and test them as new experimental therapeutic drugs. If successful, these studies will improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of glioblastoma and lead to the development of new and more efficient therapies.","7040201; ","ABOUNADER, ROGER ;","MIETZ, JUDY ","08/09/2017","07/31/2022","3' Untranslated Regions; base; Binding; Bioinformatics; Brain; Cells; chemotherapy; Clinical; clinical application; Collaborations; Complex; Convection; conventional therapy; crosslink; Data; Data Analyses; Databases; Development; effective therapy; experimental study; Focused Ultrasound; Future; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Regulation; Genes; Glioblastoma; Goals; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Human; Immunoprecipitation; improved; Investigational Therapies; Knowledge; Lead; Life Expectancy; Malignant neoplasm of brain; Malignant Neoplasms; Measures; Mediating; Messenger RNA; Microbubbles; MicroRNAs; Molecular; molecular targeted therapies; mRNA Transcript Degradation; nanomedicine; nanoparticle; new technology; novel; novel strategies; Nucleic Acids; Oncogenic; Operative Surgical Procedures; Outcome; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacology; Price; Proteins; Publishing; Radiation therapy; Regulation; Research; Resolution; RNA; Role; screening; Specimen; Testing; The Cancer Genome Atlas; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Agents; therapeutic miRNA; Therapeutic Studies; therapeutic target; Time; Toxic effect; transcriptome; Translations; tumor; Universities; Untranslated RNA; Xenograft procedure; ","Master Regulatory MicroRNAs in Glioblastoma","220841","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","303584","163292","466876",""

It is inherited as autosomal dominant. This means that each child of an affected parent has a 50% chance to inherit Huntington's disease. The disease generally starts between the ages of 30 to 40 in adults, but some patients develop the disease in adolescence. Patients with Huntington's disease often spend 10 years in costly, high level nursing facilities, because of their inability to care for themselves. Between 30,000 and 40,000 patients are affected, with many more at risk. We know the genetic cause of Huntington's disease. We know that application of RNA interference in HD animal models can prevent or ameliorate the disease. RNA interference is a method to attack and destroy mutant huntingtin gene product. However, to date, approaches for RNA interference require direct brain injection or injection into the cerebral spinal fluid. Both are suboptimal and do not have access to diseased brain cells. Exosomes provide an opportunity to treat Huntington's disease by an injection into the vein. Exosomes can be modified to cross from the blood to the brain and transport small RNAs that are used in RNA interference.

Existing behavioral and pharmacological treatments for PTSD and related depression are often effective, but substantial numbers of individuals remain symptomatic or are unable to tolerate these interventions. Additional PTSD treatments are needed. Loving-Kindness Meditation (LKM) is a novel group-based program with preliminary evidence suggesting improved symptoms of PTSD and depression. Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) is an existing evidence-based treatment for PTSD. We propose a randomized controlled trial to determine if LKM and CPT produce improvements in PTSD symptoms and depression that are not meaningfully different.

This allows the study of embryonic developmental pathways using biochemical methods, the generation of specific cell populations for regenerative medicine, and the modeling of disease and genetic correction in vitro. Although studying muscle development using pluripotent cell systems has historically been difficult or impossible because of the inefficiency with which pluripotent cells undergo skeletal muscle differentiation, we have developed methods, based on the conditional expression of myogenic master regulators, Pax3 and Pax7, to induce the muscle program in early mesoderm, and thus derive embryonic muscle progenitors with great efficiency. Our investigations will focus on 1) understanding the mechanism by which Pax3 regulates embryonic myogenesis; 2) investigating the regenerative potential of donor-derived satellite cells and their molecular signature; 3) in vitro disease modeling of DMD/BMD through the use of disease-specific iPS cell-derived myotubes.","8301594; ","PERLINGEIRO, RITA C.

Over 20 million adults in the US have chronic kidney disease (CKD) and over 0.6 million are on dialysis or have received a kidney transplant (end stage renal disease, ESRD). The incidence and prevalence of pediatric CKD also contributes to the growing volume of adults with CKD. Patients with CKD who have reached ESRD have a shortened life span, with a dismal 5-year survival rate of 33%. The adult and pediatric workforce in nephrology has been challenged with fewer entering the field and even fewer entering research. For these reasons, the Kidney Disease and Inflammation Training Program now incorporates training adult and pediatric nephrologists to meet the current and future challenges affecting our discipline. New and innovative technologies as well as traditional training platforms are described. Research is (urgently) necessary to better understand kidney disease pathogenesis and to design novel treatment options. The major goal of the Kidney Disease and Inflammation Training grant is to train the next generation of academic nephrologists and renal investigators in translational biomedical research to address the growing problem of kidney disease.","1901100; ","OKUSA, MARK DOUGLAS;","RYS-SIKORA, KRYSTYNA E","08/01/2006","07/31/2021","Inflammation; Kidney Diseases; ","Kidney Disease and Inflammation","072922","ZDK1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","12","207046","14564","168870",""

In glaucoma, there is a progressive visual field loss that if left untreated, leads to irreversible blindness. Primer Open Angle Glaucoma is the most common form of the disease, and is triggered in most cases by an elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). In turn, elevated IOP is the result of an increased resistance of the trabecular meshwork (TM) tissue to the outflow of the aqueous humor. In our laboratory we are interested in identifying genes and mechanisms involved in the development of glaucoma. Among the several candidates, one gene, Matrix Gla (MGP), could have important implications for both the understanding and the treatment of glaucoma. The gene is an inhibitor of calcification. It is responsible for pathological calcification in vascular diseases and in cancer. Its role in the eye is unknown. Interestingly, its expression is specifically localized to the TM and the peripapillary sclera (ppSC) surrounding the optic nerve head, two key tissues in the development of the disease. In this project, we propose to study the role of the Mgp gene in the eye of the living animal, by using transgenic technology. Findings from this project could lead to a new alternative treatment of glaucoma by targeting a common mechanism affecting both, the aqueous outflow at the trabecular meshwork and the biomechanical scleral strain at the ONH.","2085359; ","BORRAS, TERESA ;","LIBERMAN, ELLEN S","08/01/2016","07/31/2021","Ablation; Adult; Affect; Age; alternative treatment; Animals; Anterior; Antibodies; aqueous; Aqueous Humor; arterial stiffness; Arteries; Autopsy; Axon; axon injury; base; Behavioral; Biomechanics; Blindness; Blood Pressure; BMP2 gene; Breathing; calcification; calcification inhibitor; Calcified; Calcinosis; Cartilage; Cell Survival; Cessation of life; Chondrocytes; CRISPR/Cas technology; Development; Dexamethasone; Disease; DNA; Elastin; Evaluation; Extracellular Matrix; Eye; Fundus; Gene Transfer; Generations; Genes; Genetic; Glaucoma; Grant; Histologic; Human; Image; in vivo; inhibitor/antagonist; interest; Internal Ribosome Entry Site; Knock-in; Knock-in Mouse; Knock-out; Knockout Mice; Knowledge; Laboratories; LacZ Genes; Lead; Left; Link; LoxP-flanked allele; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; MGP gene; Microspheres; mineralization; Modeling; Molecular; Morphology; Mus; Muscle Cells; Open-Angle Glaucoma; Optic Disk; Optic Nerve; optic nerve disorder; Outcome; Pathologic; Pathway interactions; Patients; Performance; Phenotype; Physiologic Intraocular Pressure; Physiological; Predisposition; premature; prevent; Process; Rattus; Regulation; Reporter; Reporting; Resistance; response; Retinal Ganglion Cells; Role; Sclera; soft tissue; Source; Systolic Pressure; Technology; Testing; Tissues; Tomatoes; Trabecular meshwork structure; Transforming Growth Factor beta; Transgenic Organisms; Vascular Diseases; Vascular Smooth Muscle; Viral; Visual Acuity; Visual Fields; WNT Signaling Pathway; ","Targeting calcification/ stiffness in glaucoma with Matrix Gla","026220","DPVS","Diseases and Pathophysiology of the Visual System Study Section ","","","02","263031","125713","388744",""

However, we have identified some patients, Post-treatment Controllers (PTCs), who display a remarkable capacity to durably control viremia (HIV remission) after therapy interruption. HIV remission implies balanced interactions between HIV and the immune system leading to long?term viral control. However, the mechanisms of viral control observed in PTC are not completely understood. Remission of HIV infection appears more likely in patients starting cART during primary infection, although only a fraction of early-treated patients are able to achieve this status. A better understanding of the viro-immunological factors leading to HIV remission in PTC will be important to identify candidates to PTC status among patients on long-term cART and to increase the probability to achieve HIV remission.","12489759; ","SAEZ-CIRION, ASIER ;","","","","Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Address; Aftercare; Anti-Retroviral Agents; antiretroviral therapy; Antiviral Agents; Antiviral Therapy; Biological Preservation; Blood; Cells; Characteristics; Chronic; Clinical; cohort; Data; Disease remission; DNA; Early treatment; Frequencies; Genetic; Haplotypes; HIV; HIV antiretroviral; HIV Infections; HIV-1; immune activation; Immune response; Immune system; Immunologic Factors; Immunologics; Infection; Infection Control; Interruption; Knowledge; Life; Macaca; Maintenance; mathematical model; nonhuman primate; outcome prediction; pathogen; patient population; Patients; Pattern; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Predictive Factor; predictive marker; Primary Infection; Probability; Sampling; Shapes; SIV; Therapeutic Intervention; Time; Tissues; treatment duration; treatment effect; Viral; viral rebound; Viral reservoir; Viremia; virology; Virus; Withholding Treatment; ","Project 1.

Infected hosts respond by the formation of granulomas, which help to contain the bacilli. However, organisms within granulomas are protected from the full scope of immune-mediated defenses. Modulation of immune-mediated destructive pathology, while preserving essential immune responses, will allow more effective immune control, and may also provide an opportunity for more effective delivery of therapeutics to the site within tissue where infectious agents reside. These studies will capitalize on our experience using novel recombinant mouse and human lactoferrins as immune modulators to ameliorate granulomas in an infectious-induced challenge pathology model, offering a novel therapeutic strategy for treatment of tuberculosis disease.","1973898 (contact); 8581945; ","ACTOR, JEFFREY K (contact); KRUZEL, MARIAN L;","KRAIGSLEY, ALISON ","02/15/2015","07/31/2019","Aerosols; Affect; Antimycobacterial Agents; Bacillus (bacterium); Bacteria; Binding; Biological Models; Cell Line; Cells; Chinese Hamster Ovary Cell; Clinical; combat; Cord Factors; Cytoplasmic Granules; Development; Disease; disease transmission; Dose; Effector Cell; experience; experimental study; Genus Mycobacterium; Glycoproteins; Goals; Granuloma; Granulomatous; Histology; Human; Immune; Immune response; Immunity; immunopathology; immunoregulation; in vivo; in vivo Model; Individual; Infection; Infectious Agent; Inflammation; Inflammation Mediators; innovation; Iron; Killings; Lactoferrin; Liver; Lung; macrophage; Mediating; Modality; Modeling; Monitor; mouse model; Mus; mycobacterial; Mycobacterium Infections; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; neutrophil; novel; novel therapeutics; Oral; Organism; Outcome; Pathogenicity; Pathologic; Pathology; Phase; phase 2 study; Play; Population; pre-clinical research; prevent; Production; prophylactic; Protocols documentation; Public Health; Pulmonary Pathology; Rattus; Recombinants; Research Project Grants; response; Role; Safety; scale up; Site; Spleen; Structure of parenchyma of lung; success; System; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Agents; Tissues; tool; Toxic effect; Toxicity Tests; Toxicology; Treatment Efficacy; treatment strategy; Trehalose; Tuberculosis; tuberculosis drugs; tuberculosis treatment; ","Lactoferrin Modulation of Granuloma Pathology","117990","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","","","815321",""

The predictions will derived from experimental data obtained at the time the hearing aid is fitted. It is planned to develop a profile of indicators that are preditive of successful outcomes on important aspects hearing aid use. A predictive profile of this type would allow consumers to make an informed choice when investing in a hearing aid and would know what to expect after the hearing aid has been fitted. Knowing what to expect is an important consideration and would reduce substantially the dissatisfaction when the hearing aid does not meet expectations thereby reducing the large number of unsatisfactory outcomes with a corresponding increase in the number of reasonably satisfied outcomes. The key problem is to develop and evaluate indicators that will provide reliable predictions of successful outcome on important aspects of hearing aid use. A battery of tests that have demonstrated a significant correlation with well established self-report outcome measure will be refined to improve the correlation with the output measure. An improvement in the correlation will allow for more accurate predictions of this output measure from measurements taken prior to fitting a hearing aid. A new test will be developed that takes into account the interactive nature of human communication and which will be predictive of the extent to which a hearing impaired person is able to participate in a conversation. Normative data will be obtained on the test with both younger and older subjects. Practical methods of field evaluation will be implemented using ratings of sound quality and speech clarity to evaluate the performance of the hearing aid. The method of evaluation will include monitoring of the clients acoustic environment at the time the ratings are obtained. The final stage of the project will evaluate the accuracy of the method of prediction with several different self-report output measures.","1898807; ","LEVITT, HARRY NMI;","KING, KELLY ANNE","08/07/2013","07/31/2018","Acclimatization; Acoustics; Aging; Auditory system; base; Binaural; Client; cognitive function; Communication; Cues; Data; Ear; Environment; Evaluation; expectation; Hearing; Hearing Aids; Hearing Impaired Persons; hearing impairment; Human Characteristics; Impairment; improved; instrument; Interactive Communication; interest; Judgment; Masks; Measurement; Measures; Methods; Modification; Monitor; Noise; Outcome; Outcome Measure; Output; Patient Self-Report; Performance; Persons; public health relevance; satisfaction; Self-Administered; Signal Transduction; sound; Specific qualifier value; Speech; Speech Intelligibility; speech recognition; Speed; Testing; Time; Vision; ","Realistic Hearing-Aid Outcome Measures","012305","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","05","160465","9898","170363",""

Most CSA research with sexual minority men relies on quantitative assessment that often precludes consideration of cultural variations in how formative sexual experiences are understood, are based on inconsistent or overly restrictive definitions of abuse, and therefore may fail to detect certain abusive experiences (e.g., those involving female perpetrators), which can have harmful health consequences if they remain unrecognized. This mixed-methods study will overcome existing limitations by drawing on perspectives of Black and Latino sexual minority men and relevant service providers to better understand the role of, and need to include, sexual abuse histories in treatment and counseling settings, with the long-term goal of improving assessment and health outcomes.","8868590 (contact); 11051397; ","BENOIT, ELLEN  (contact); DOWNING, MARTIN ;","WHITE, DELLA ","08/31/2016","07/31/2018","Address; Adult; adverse outcome; Age; Alcohol consumption; Alcohol or Other Drugs use; base; Behavioral; Bisexual; boys; Caring; Child; Child Sexual Abuse; Childhood; Coercion; Counseling; Drug usage; Emotional; Environmental Risk Factor; Ethnic group; experience; Exploratory/Developmental Grant; Failure; Female; Fright; Gays; Gender; Gender Role; Goals; Health; health service use; Health Services Accessibility; Healthcare; high risk sexual behavior; HIV; HIV/STD; Homosexuals; improved; intersectionality; Intervention; Interview; Latino; Lead; Link; male; Masculine; Measures; meetings; men; men who have sex with men; men who have sex with men and women; Mental Health; Mental Health Services; Meta-Analysis; Methods; New York City; Outcome; outreach; Participant; Perception; perpetrators; Persons; Population; pressure; Prevalence; Prevention; Provider; psychologic; Public Health; public health relevance; Race; Readiness; Recording of previous events; Research; Research Personnel; revictimization; Risk Behaviors; Role; same sex behavior; Same-sex; Services; Sex Behavior; Sexual abuse; sexual coercion; sexual encounter; sexual minority; sexual relationship; Sexuality; Shame; social; Social isolation; social stigma; Socialization; Societies; Source; Stigmatization; Stress; substance abuse treatment; substance misuse; Time; Training; Trauma; Treatment Protocols; Variant; Woman; ","Understanding the Impact of Abuse on Men's Risk Behavior","084939","HDEP","Health Disparities and Equity Promotion Study Section ","","","02","132218","46455","178673",""

The proposed research program is focused on developing, through experiment and theory, a general and quantitative approach towards understanding such transitions. The proposed approach draws from the physico- chemical sciences, and is shown to have validity, using preliminary data, for understanding the process in which healthy human breast cells switch to a cancerous phenotype following exposure to chemical carcinogens found in cigarette smoke. We propose to study cellular transitions associated with the resistance of drug resistance, within the cancers of glioblastoma multiforme, and melanoma. In both case, we analyze the transition to therapies that can be combined with the primary treatment to halt the transition, and thus halt the development of resistance. We also describe how a detailed kinetic picture of certain transitions that appear reversible can provide guidance for non-continuous therapy dosing for improved tumor killing.","8126809 (contact); 12266284; ","HEATH, JAMES R.

During normal wound healing the cytokine, interferon-beta (IFN?), is expressed at high levels in the tissues; the subsequent binding of this cytokine to its receptor increases the chromatin-modifying enzyme (CME), SETDB2, which acts to repress inflammatory gene transcription in macrophages. In the setting of diabetes, SETDB2 is not induced during wound healing and increased inflammatory macrophages in tissue promote chronic inflammation and non-healing. It is this pathway that may contribute to the poorly understood conundrum whereby diabetic wounds display chronic inflammation and fail to heal. It is this unique sequence of events we will study under the auspices of this application. The success of the studies outlined in this proposal may lead to new therapeutic targets that may decrease morbidity and mortality related to diabetic wounds.","11308185; ","GALLAGHER, KATHERINE ANN;","KLAUZINSKA, MALGORZATA ","08/09/2017","06/30/2022","Amputation; Animal Model; Anti-inflammatory; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; base; Binding; care systems; Cells; Cellular Metabolic Process; Chromatin; Chronic; cytokine; Cytokine Gene; Cytokine Signaling; Data; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetic wound; Environment; Enzymes; Epigenetic Process; epigenetic regulation; Event; Evolution; experimental study; Failure; Gene Expression; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Transcription; healing; Health Care Costs; histone modification; Histones; Human; IL1A gene; Impaired wound healing; Impairment; improved; Inflammation; Inflammatory; inhibitor/antagonist; Injury; innovation; interferon alpha receptor; Interferon-beta; Interleukin-1 beta; Interleukin-12; Kinetics; Laboratories; Lead; Link; Lysine; macrophage; Mediating; Metabolic; Metabolic Pathway; Metabolism; Methods; Methyltransferase; Molecular; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; mouse model; Mus; new therapeutic target; NF-kappa B; non-healing wounds; Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; novel; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pharmacology; Phenotype; Plant Roots; Play; pre-clinical; prevent; Process; promoter; Proteins; receptor; Recruitment Activity; Regulation; Resolution; Role; Signal Transduction; Small Interfering RNA; STAT1 gene; Stream; success; targeted treatment; Testing; Therapeutic; Time; tissue repair; Tissues; TNF gene; Up-Regulation; Uric Acid; Work; wound; Wound Healing; Xanthines; XDH gene; ","The Interferon-beta (IFN-beta)/SETDB2 Epigenetic Axis Regulates Inflammation And Metabolism In Diabetic Wounds","137919","SAT","Surgery, Anesthesiology and Trauma Study Section ","","","01","311800","171490","483290",""

Supplemental oxygen and positive pressure respiratory support (e.g. continuous positive airway pressure, CPAP) are two important therapies that are intended to assist the baby through the immediate postnatal period until the lungs can function properly. Some therapies, have unintended side-effects. Supplemental oxygen, for example, adversely affects lung development and predisposes the infant to asthma and wheezing later in childhood. The primary goal of this proposal, however, is to focus on an animal model of CPAP to determine if/ how it might also have similar long-term adverse effects on the lung. We propose that mechanical stretch imposed on the lung by CPAP activates mechanisms that cause the airways to become hyper-reactive, a characteristic feature of wheezing and asthma. The data from this proposal will be the first to offer some insight into how CPAP impacts airway reactivity and wheezing disorders in former preterm infants, while also revealing potentially promising targets to prevent such unintended effects of CPAP.","10844282; ","MACFARLANE, PETER ;","LIN, SARA ","08/10/2017","06/30/2021","Adult; Adverse effects; adverse outcome; Affect; Age; airway hyperresponsiveness; airway remodeling; Alveolar; Animal Model; Asthma; base; Breathing; Calcium Signaling; Calcium-Sensing Receptors; Caring; CD44 gene; Cell Proliferation; Cells; Characteristics; Childhood; Childhood Asthma; children with cystic fibrosis; Clinical; clinical application; clinical care; clinically relevant; clinically significant; Complication; Continuous Positive Airway Pressure; Data; Disease; Early Intervention; Elements; Environmental air flow; Equilibrium; Extracellular Matrix; Eye Abnormalities; fetal; Fetus; Goals; Growth; HAS3 gene; Homeostasis; Human; Hyaluronan; hyaluronan synthase 1; Hyaluronidase; Hyperoxia; In Vitro; in vitro Model; in vivo; in vivo Model; Infant; inhibitor/antagonist; insight; interest; Intervention; laser capture microdissection; Life; Long-Term Effects; Lung; lung development; Mechanical ventilation; Mechanics; Mediating; Modality; Modeling; Molecular; Molecular Weight; mouse model; Mus; Muscle Cells; nCPAP Ventilation; Neonatal; Newborn Infant; novel; Oxygen; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Periodicity; Phenotype; postnatal; Premature Infant; Preparation; pressure; prevent; Prevention; Production; receptor; Recovery; Reporting; respiratory; respiratory distress syndrome; Respiratory physiology; respiratory smooth muscle; Role; Safety; Savings; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Slice; Small Interfering RNA; Smooth Muscle; Stretching; Structure; System; Techniques; Testing; Therapeutic; TLR4 gene; virtual; Wheezing; ","Understanding CPAP Effects in the Developing Airway","138402","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","456661","166903","623564",""

LDD KT is the most promising treatment option to meet the challenges of a rising population of Americans with end stage renal disease (ESRD), but LDD KT rates are not increasing and racial disparities in the use of LDD KT are widening. Prior research has documented that non-white transplant candidates are less likely than white candidates to have family or friends evaluated for LDD KT, and that those evaluated for donation to non-white candidates are less likely to be deemed healthy and compatible enough to donate than those evaluated for white candidates, but it has not examined the full family and social networks in which candidates are embedded in order to determine whether limited access to healthy, compatible donors drives underutilization and racial disparities or whether other social barriers are in operation. This neglect is unfortunate because there are many non-medical interventions that could be tested to increase rates of LDD KT by giving candidates more information about what types of family members to approach and how to approach them. Prior qualitative and quantitative pilot work we have conducted suggests that some of the largest barriers arise from decisions candidates make about which family members to ask for kidney transplants, and whether family members volunteer to be evaluated upon hearing of a candidate's diagnosis. We propose a multi-center study to collect novel data on transplant candidates' social networks and to test promising social network interventions that could reduce barriers to LDD KT, which we will evaluate with longitudinal medical records follow up. In the first year and a half of the project, we will build on prior qualitative, quantitative, and experimental pilot data we have collected to develop and refine two separate interventions in focus groups and survey vignette experiments. In years two through four, we will survey transplant candidates at two large transplant centers about their family and social networks, with special attention to candidate perceptions of their network members' health and willingness and ability to donate. During this time, we will also survey candidate network members using effective referral based survey strategies in order to obtain additional information on the barriers to donation among family and close social network members of kidney transplant candidates. We will assign each surveyed candidate to one of three experimental arms that encompass the interventions developed during the first year and a half of the project: a control group, a group that we coach on which of their network members to approach, and a group that we coach on how to approach their network members. In years four and five of the project, we will follow up on the candidates, examining whether they had a potential donor evaluated, who that donor was, and whether they were able to obtain a living donor transplant. The results of this project will contribute to basic and applied knowledge about social barriers to access in LDD KT, and quantify the efficacy of promising social network approaches for promoting greater utilization of LDD KT and reducing racial disparities therein.  ","8453358; ","DAW, JONATHAN KYLE;","WADDY, SALINA P","08/01/2017","05/31/2022","Address; Affect; African American; aging population; Algorithms; American; arm; Attention; base; Blood; Cause of Death; Characteristics; Clinic; Clinical; Control Groups; Data; design; Diagnosis; Donor person; Education; effective therapy; Effectiveness; efficacy testing; End stage renal failure; Equilibrium; Ethics; Evaluation; evidence base; Evidence based intervention; experience; experimental study; Family; Family member; Focus Groups; follow-up; Friends; Genetic Models; Goals; Growth; Health; Health Insurance; Health Status; Hearing; Immunologics; improved; Incidence; Individual; Insurance Coverage; Intervention; Interview; Kidney; Kidney Transplantation; Kinship Networks; Knowledge; Lead; Living Donors; Maps; Measures; Mediating; Mediation; Medical; Medical Records; member; Methods; Modeling; mortality; Multicenter Studies; neglect; novel; operation; Organ Donations; Outcome; Patients; Pattern; Perception; Pilot Projects; Population; Population Genetics; predictive modeling; Prevalence; Probability; Process; programs; prospective; Public Health; Race; racial and ethnic disparities; racial disparity; racial diversity; Randomized; Recruitment Activity; Reporting; Research; Research Personnel; Respondent; Risk; social; Social Network; Structure; success; Surveys; Testing; therapy design; Time; tool; Transplantation; Treatment Efficacy; Variant; volunteer; willingness; Work; ","Social Network Interventions to Reduce Race Disparities in Living Kidney Donation","114888","ZDK1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","156639","89598","246237",""

Most studies aimed at characterizing the reservoir have been limited to male participants. Thus, while women constitute greater than 50% of people living with HIV disease, very little is known about the characteristics of the reservoir in this population. Factors such as cyclical hormonal levels could impact HIV persistent in women. This study outlines a comprehensive approach to rigorously characterize the distribution of the replication competent HIV reservoirs in different memory T-cell subpopulations in the periphery and in tissues of women. This study will also assess the stability of the reservoir in women and identify factors that contribute to the establishment of this reservoir and evaluate effective approaches that can be undertaken to disrupt latency in women. As such this study will further the understanding of persistent HIV infection in women and generate new ideas that may eventually lead to the development of therapeutics to eradicate HIV in all people.","10446692; ","ARCHIN, NANCIE M;","LAWRENCE, DIANE M","08/08/2017","07/31/2021","adaptive immunity; Address; Affect; Anatomy; Anti-Retroviral Agents; Antigens; antiretroviral therapy; Antiviral Therapy; Area; beta catenin; CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Cell Count; Cells; Characteristics; Complex; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disease; Disease remission; Effector Cell; Estrogen Receptor alpha; Estrogen Receptors; Estrogens; Female; Frequencies; Gender; Genetic; Genetic Transcription; Gonadal Steroid Hormones; Half-Life; HIV; HIV Infections; HIV-1; Hormonal; Hormonal Change; Immune; immune clearance; immune function; Immunologic Surveillance; In Vitro; Infection; Interferon Type I; Interferon-alpha; Intervention; Knowledge; Lead; Life; Maintenance; male; Mediating; Memory; memory CD4 T lymphocyte; men; Modality; Natural Immunity; Natural Killer Cells; Nature; novel; Participant; Pathogenesis; Periodicity; Physiological; Planets; Population; promoter; reactivation from latency; receptor expression; Recrudescences; reproductive tract; Research Priority; Rest; RNA; Role; Signal Transduction; small molecule; T memory cell; T-Lymphocyte; Technology; Therapeutic; therapeutic development; Therapeutic Intervention; Time; Tissues; Viremia; Virus; Woman; ","The HIV Reservoir in Women: Implications for HIV cure interventions","134363","ACE","AIDS Clinical Studies and Epidemiology Study Section ","","","01","352912","195866","548778",""

Data from large clinical trials demonstrate that lowering intraocular pressure in people with glaucoma (whether elevated or not) is neuroprotective; effectively slowing or stopping vision loss. Unfortunately, current medical therapies do not lower intraocular pressure sufficiently in most people, likely because they do not target the conventional outflow pathway that is diseased and causes pressure elevation in glaucoma. The present project extends our investigation of a pressure-sensitive feedback loop involving nitric oxide that regulates outflow resistance through the conventional pathway, which is the chief determinant of intraocular pressure. The proposed studies are geared towards identifying and testing therapies for targeted delivery of nitric oxide within the conventional outflow pathway to more successfully lower intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients.","8255092; 6807329 (contact); ","OVERBY, DARRYL R; STAMER, W DANIEL (contact);","LIBERMAN, ELLEN S","04/01/2012","07/31/2021","Affect; Anterior; base; Benchmarking; Blindness; blood pressure regulation; Blood Vessels; Bypass; Caliber; Cells; Ciliary Muscle; Clinical Trials; Data; design; Development; Devices; Disease; Distal; Drainage procedure; Endothelial Cells; Etiology; Exhibits; experimental study; Feedback; Free Radicals; Funding; Generations; genetic linkage; Glaucoma; glaucoma surgery; Goals; Heme; Homeostasis; Human; Individual; inhibitor/antagonist; Intervention; Investigation; Knowledge; Location; Mediating; Medical; minimally invasive; Molecular; new technology; Nitric Oxide; Nitric Oxide Donors; NOS3 gene; novel; Ocular Hypertension; Outcome Study; Pathway interactions; Patients; Perfusion; Permeability; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Physiologic Intraocular Pressure; Physiologic pulse; Physiological; pressure; Primary Open Angle Glaucoma; Production; Regulation; Relaxation; Resistance; response; Role; shear stress; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Smooth Muscle Myocytes; Stents; Structure of sinus venosus of sclera; success; targeted delivery; targeted treatment; Testing; Therapeutic; therapeutic target; Tissues; Topical application; Trabecular meshwork structure; Variant; Vasodilation; Vasodilator Agents; Venous; Venous Pressure level; ","eNOS-Dependent Mechanoregulation of Intraocular Pressure","022359","DPVS","Diseases and Pathophysiology of the Visual System Study Section ","","","06","329087","92556","421643",""

The disease has debilitating and potentially life-threatening consequences with mortality still approaching 10% over 5 years. There is unmet medical need, as current treatments are only partially effective and have significant side effects. As originally uncovered in our laboratory and overwhelmingly confirmed by others, a natural antioxidant, glutathione, is depleted in lymphocytes of patients with SLE; this may be a key factor that causes immune system dysfunction and contributes to self-destructive autoimmunity. Administration of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which serves as a precursor of glutathione, improves the clinical outcome of murine lupus. NAC limits the toxicity of pro-oxidant, immunosuppressant medications that are commonly used in patients with SLE. Moreover, NAC improves fatigue, the most disabling symptom reported by patients with SLE. Although NAC is inexpensive and widely distributed in health food stores, and large doses can be safely administered to humans intravenously, it is currently unavailable as an oral medication by prescription. Therefore, we initiated a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase I/II study of NAC in 36 SLE patients to evaluate its safety, tolerance, and metabolic, immunological, and therapeutic effects. The results of this pilot study show that 2.4 g/day NAC and 4.8 g/day NAC are safe and they improve disease activity and fatigue through inhibiting the autoimmune inflammatory process over 3 months. This U34 planning grant has been initiated to bring together experienced lupus investigators with a coherent management structure and clear communication strategy to evaluate the safety and clinical efficacy of NAC over 12 months in a phase II multi- center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, designated as SLE treatment with NAC (SNAC), that meets FDA, OHRP and NIAMS regulations and policy requirements. The preliminary specific aims for the future clinical trial will:  1) Determine the tolerance, safety, and therapeutic efficacy of NAC, within a dosage range of 2.4 g/day to 4.8 g/day to be titrated to tolerance during an initial 3-month open label period, in comparison to placebo in SLE patients during a 12-month intervention followed by a 1-month washout.  2) Determine whether the reversal of glutathione depletion is sustained over 12 months and predicts response to NAC.","8147385; 1891355 (contact); ","MCDERMOTT, MICHAEL P; PERL, ANDRAS  (contact);","WITTER, JAMES ","08/01/2016","07/31/2018","Acetaminophen; Acetylcysteine; Address; Adopted; Adverse effects; Affect; Antidotes; Antioxidants; arm; Autoantibodies; Autoimmune Diseases; Autoimmune Process; Autoimmunity; base; belimumab; Biological; biomarker-driven; Blood; Case Report Form; Cell Lineage; Clinical; Clinical assessments; clinical efficacy; Clinical Protocols; Clinical Trials; Collaborations; Communication; Conceptions; Consent Forms; Controlled Clinical Trials; Data; Data Collection; data management; design; Development; disabling symptom; Disease; DNA; dosage; Dose; Double-Blind Method; effective therapy; electronic data capture system; Enrollment; Ensure; Etiology; experience; Fatigue; FRAP1 gene; Functional disorder; Future; Glutathione; Goals; Grant; Health Food; Human; Immune System and Related Disorders; Immunologics; Immunosuppressive Agents; improved; indexing; Inflammatory; Intention; Intervention; Intravenous; Investigational Therapies; Kidney Diseases; Knowledge; Laboratories; Life; Literature; Liver Failure; Lupus; lupus prone mice; Lymphocyte; Manuals; Mediating; Medical; Metabolic; Monitor; mortality; Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial; Multicenter Studies; Multicenter Trials; Mus; National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases; novel; novel strategies; open label; operation; Oral; Outcome; Outcome Measure; Oxidative Stress; Pamphlets; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacy facility; Phase; Phase II Clinical Trials; Pilot Projects; Placebo Control; Placebos; Policies; predicting response; Prevalence; primary outcome; Procedures; Process; Production; Proteins; Protocols documentation; Randomized; Randomized Controlled Trials; Reactive Oxygen Species; Regulation; Reporting; Research Design; Research Infrastructure; Research Personnel; response; Role; Safety; sample collection; Sampling; secondary outcome; sensor; sharing data; Standardization; Statistical Data Interpretation; Structure; Systemic Lupus Erythematosus; T-Cell Activation; T-Lymphocyte; Techniques; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Effect; Titrations; Toxic effect; Transportation; treatment duration; Treatment Efficacy; U-Series Cooperative Agreements; United States; Universities; Urine; Visit; ","Treatment of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) with N-acetylcysteine (NAC)","068052","AMSC","Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases Clinical Trials Review Committee ","","","02","125000","77500","202500",""

Current antidepressants generally have a slow onset and many patients do not respond to current medications. The results of this project will establish whether novel kappa opioid receptor antagonisst have the capacity to produce a rapid antidepressant and anxiolytic response that is similar to ketamine. The neural mechanisms underlying these effects will be elucidated and a neural circuit in brain will be identified.

Most individuals with aphasia have difficulty producing words and sentences which impairs their ability to communicate naturally. Some have an even more severe disorder that prevents them from producing any words at all. Some people recover very well from this disorder, while others do not, and the reason why is unclear. The proposed study will use state-of-the-art brain imaging tools to examine the underlying brain structures important for recovery of language production. We will also focus on the fiber pathways that connect these brain regions to one another, as we have found them to be critical for supporting speech and language functions and expect them to play a key role in recovery, as well. Information resulting from this study will provide clinicians with the information they need to give people with aphasia the most accurate diagnosis, prognosis, and effective treatment to date.","2107396; ","DRONKERS, NINA F.;","COOPER, JUDITH ","08/09/2017","07/31/2022","accurate diagnosis; Affect; American; Aphasia; aphasic; Area; base; Behavioral; Brain; Brain imaging; Brain Injuries; Brain region; Characteristics; common symptom; Communication; Contralateral; Craniocerebral Trauma; density; Diffuse; Diffusion; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; disability; Disease; effective therapy; Evaluation; Exhibits; Fiber; gray matter; Image; Imaging Device; Imaging Techniques; Impairment; indexing; Individual; Injury; insight; Language; Language Disorders; Lesion; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Measurable; Measurement; Measures; Modification; Monitor; morphometry; multimodality; myelination; neuroimaging; Neurologic; neuromechanism; Neurons; novel; Outcome; outcome forecast; Participant; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pattern; Performance; Play; post stroke; prevent; Production; Quality of life; reconstruction; Recovery; relating to nervous system; Resolution; Site; skills; social engagement; Speech; stroke; Structure; Symptoms; Techniques; Testing; Thick; Time; time interval; tool; tractography; treatment strategy; white matter; white matter damage; ","Neural Mechanisms and Recovery of Language Production Deficits in Aphasia","016345","LCOM","Language and Communication Study Section ","","","01","343910","31841","375751",""

We will further modify hiPSC reporters to generate mutant alleles and develop a human disease model with which we can potentially identify pathways important in maintaining and/or restoring photoreceptors.","7349285; ","WAHLIN, KARL J;","NEUHOLD, LISA ","08/01/2016","07/31/2019","Address; Alleles; Area; base; Bioinformatics; Biological Assay; Biological Models; Biology; Blindness; Cell Death; Cell Differentiation process; Cell Line; cell type; Cells; Cellular Stress; Cessation of life; Chemicals; Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats; Cone; CRISPR/Cas technology; Data Set; Development; differential expression; Disease; Disease model; DNA sequencing; Eye Development; Eye diseases; Functional disorder; Future; Gene Expression; gene therapy; Generations; Genes; Genome; genome editing; Goals; Human; human disease; human stem cells; Immunohistochemistry; In Vitro; in vitro Assay; induced pluripotent stem cell; innovative technologies; insight; interstitial retinol-binding protein; Knock-in; Knowledge; Label; Leber's amaurosis; Measures; Mentors; Modeling; Molecular; Molecular Profiling; Morphology; mutant; Mutation; new therapeutic target; next generation sequencing; novel; Opsin; optic cup; Optic vesicle; Parents; Pathway interactions; Phase; Phenotype; photoreceptor degeneration; Photoreceptors; Pluripotent Stem Cells; Positioning Attribute; Process; Proteins; Protocols documentation; public health relevance; Rare Diseases; repaired; Reporter; Research; Retina; Retinal; Retinal Degeneration; Retinal Diseases; Retinal Photoreceptors; Retinitis Pigmentosa; Rhodopsin; screening; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; small molecule; small molecule libraries; Standardization; Structure; Technical Expertise; Terminator Codon; Therapeutic Intervention; Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases; tool; Training; transcription activator-like effector nucleases; transcriptome sequencing; translational study; United States National Institutes of Health; Variant; Work; ","Modeling Photoreceptor Development and Disease Using Human Pluripotent Stem Cells","024648","NSS","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","04","161935","84664","246599",""

The primary goal of this pilot program is to determine if the combination of these 3 non-nerve gas exposures is sufficient to cause long-lasting changes in brain functioning. This will be investigated via a behavioral battery and histological analysis of exposed mice up to 6 months later. Identifying non-nerve gas mechanisms for long-lasting neuropathology and brain dysfunction can cause a significant shift in how GWI is viewed medically and socially.

Currently, treatment for DBA is inadequate, and new approaches are needed. In the initial years of the next phase of our project we propose to work within the Progenitor Cell Translation Consortium to initiate clinical trials of these novel agents, and to establish a comprehensive center that can discover new drugs, cell therapies, and gene therapies for a range of genetic blood diseases, including Shwachman Diamond Syndrome, Fanconi Anemia, Dyskeratosis Congenita, primary immune deficiency, and hemoglobinopathy. We will build competency for both internal discovery and clinical translation, as well as Core facilities and generic platforms, and will invite collaborations from external investigators, thereby serving the broader mission of the PCTC. Success in our aims will provide new insights into the mechanisms of genetic blood disease and lead to novel treatments for conditions that while individually rare, are collectively a major challenge for hematology.","1885134 (contact); 1916843; 1890123; 9574819; 1882868; ","DALEY, GEORGE Q (contact); LIPTON, JEFFREY M; SHIMAMURA, AKIKO ; VLACHOS, ADRIANNA ; ZON, LEONARD IRA;","THOMAS, JOHN ","09/23/2016","05/31/2023","Address; Alleles; analog; Anemia; base; Biological Assay; Blood; blood lead; bone marrow failure syndrome; Bone Marrow Stem Cell; Boston; Catalogs; Cell model; Cell Therapy; Cell Transplantation; Cells; Cellular biology; Chemicals; Clinical; clinical translation; Clinical Trials; Collaborations; Communities; Competence; Core Facility; CRISPR/Cas technology; Data; Defect; Development; Diamond; Diamond-Blackfan anemia; disability; Disease; disease phenotype; Dyskeratosis Congenita; Erythroid; Failure; Fanconi's Anemia; FDA approved; Fishes; gene therapy; Generic Drugs; Genetic; Genetic Engineering; Genetic Models; Genetically Engineered Mouse; Goals; Hematological Disease; Hematology; Hematopoietic; Hematopoietic stem cells; Hemoglobinopathies; Human; humanized mouse; Immune; In Vitro; in vivo; Individual; induced pluripotent stem cell; Inherited; insight; Institution; Investigation; Lead; Mission; Modeling; Molecular; mouse model; Mus; Mutagenesis; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; novel; novel strategies; novel therapeutics; Other Genetics; Pancytopenia; Pathology; Patients; Pediatric Hospitals; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacology; Pharmacotherapy; Phase; Phenotype; Pluripotent Stem Cells; Population; Probability; progenitor; Reagent; repaired; Research Personnel; RPS19 gene; screening; small hairpin RNA; small molecule; stem; stem cell therapy; Stem cells; success; Syndrome; System; Techniques; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Effect; therapeutic gene; Translations; treatment strategy; Trifluoperazine; Umbilical Cord Blood; Work; Zebrafish; ","Stem cells for therapeutics discovery in genetic blood disorders","134812","ZHL1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","648793","382150","1030943",""

In higher plants and animals, the genetic material is packaged together with specialized proteins in structures called chromosomes that are themselves packed within the cell nucleus. How these chromosomes are duplicated, and how the DNA they contain is replicated, to allow faithful copies to be made from generation to generation, is a central question in biology. The entirety of the DNA of an organism (its ?genome?) has to be copied with minimal errors every time the cell divides, which involves multiple ?proof-reading? and error- correction? mechanisms that operate at the molecular level to ensure excellent copying fidelity. When cells begin to divide uncontrollably during the development of cancer, errors tend to accumulate which themselves then contribute to how the disease progresses. The centrality and importance of this process, and its relevance to the development of cancer in particular, has led a large but diverse group of scientists towards the study of DNA replication in numerous systems. The aim of the conference on Eukaryotic DNA Replication & Genome Maintenance is to provide a forum to bring together the diverse group of scientists working in different areas of this field. The conference will be an open international meeting devoted to the most recent advances in the rapidly evolving field of eukaryotic DNA replication and the maintenance of genome integrity. Oral presentations will consist of a combination of invited presentations and selected presentations from submitted abstracts. This ensures the participation of junior and senior leaders in the field and the presentation of the most exciting results emerging at the time of the meeting. The oral presentations will be complemented by poster presentations in two poster sessions, also selected from submitted abstracts.","7039607; ","STEWART, DAVID J.;","SHARMAN, ANU ","08/10/2017","07/31/2018","Alpha Cell; American; Animal Genetics; anticancer research; Archives; Area; Asians; Award; Biochemistry; biological adaptation to stress; biological research; Biology; biophysical techniques; cancer cell; career; Cell Cycle; Cell Cycle Progression; cell growth; Cell Nucleus; Cells; Chromatin; Chromatin Structure; Chromosomal Instability; chromosome replication; Chromosomes; Collaborations; Complement; Data; Development; Diné Nation; Disease; DNA replication fork; Drosophila genus; Drug resistance; Ensure; Environment; Epigenetic Process; Eukaryota; European; Event; event cycle; experience; Faculty; Feedback; Fostering; fundamental research; Gene Amplification; Generations; Genetic; Genetic Materials; Genetic Transcription; Genome; genome integrity; Genome Stability; Genomic Instability; Genomics; Goals; graduate student; Growth; improved; Industrialization; interest; International; Internet; Investigation; Laboratories; Lead; Learning; lectures; Length of Stay; Life; Maintenance; Malignant Neoplasms; Mammalian Cell; meetings; Minority; Molecular; Molecular Biology; Mutagenesis; Oral; Organism; Participant; Peer Review; Play; Postdoctoral Fellow; posters; Process; programs; Proteins; Published Comment; Radiation therapy; rapid growth; Regulation; Repair Material; repaired; Replication Initiation; Replication Origin; Replication-Associated Process; Research; Research Institute; Research Personnel; resistance mechanism; response; Role; S Phase; Schedule; Science; Scientist; Selection Criteria; Senior Scientist; Series; Signal Transduction; Site; Stress; Structure; success; symposium; Syndrome; System; Time; tumor; unpublished works; Vascular Plant; Woman; Work; Xenopus; Yeasts; ","CSHL Eukaryotic DNA Replication & Genome Maintenance Conference","217040","ZCA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","3000","","3000",""

The cause of IBD remains unknown leading to difficulty in finding treatments that reliably lead to remission. IBD accounted for more than 121,000 VA healthcare system hospitalizations from 1975 to 2006, about 1 of every 200 admissions. IBD patients require chronic therapy with frequent office visits and repeated admissions. Additionally, CRC occurs in Veterans with IBD at a younger age and more proximal location compared to Veterans without IBD. The link between IBD and CRC is firmly established, and a 2001 meta-analysis calculated the cumulative probabilities of developing CRC in UC as 2% by 10 years, 8% by 20 years, and 18% by 30 years. There is an ongoing need to develop therapies that ameliorate morbidity and decrease CRC, and we aim to establish eotaxin-1 as one such target.","9569223; ","COBURN, LORI A;","","07/01/2013","06/30/2018","Admission activity; Adoptive Transfer; Adult; Adverse effects; Affect; Age; American; Apoptosis; Arginine; Award; Azoxymethane; Basic Amino Acid Transport Systems; Biological Assay; Biological Markers; Body Weight decreased; carcinogenesis; CCL11 gene; cell motility; chemokine; Chemotactic Factors; Childhood; Chronic; Citrobacter; Citrobacter rodentium; Clinical; cohort; Colitis; Colon; Colon Carcinoma; Colorectal Cancer; Crohn's disease; CSF3 gene; cytokine; Data; Development; Disease; Disease remission; eosinophil; eosinophilic inflammation; Eotaxin; Epithelial; Epithelial Cells; Experimental Models; Gastritis; Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor; Healthcare Systems; Helicobacter pylori; Histologic; Hospitalization; Human; Immune; immune activation; Immune response; Immunosuppressive Agents; In Vitro; Infection; Infiltration; Inflammation; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Inflammatory Response; Injury; injury and repair; Innate Immune Response; insight; Lead; Length; Link; Location; Lung; macrophage; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; Meta-Analysis; Metabolism; Modeling; Modification; Morbidity - disease rate; mouse model; Mus; novel therapeutics; Observational Study; Office Visits; Patients; Permeability; Phenotype; Physicians; Predisposing Factor; Probability; prospective; public health relevance; Publishing; Quality of life; reduce symptoms; Reporting; Risk; Role; Scientist; Serum; Severity of illness; Small inducible cytokine A24; Sodium Dextran Sulfate; Splenocyte; Supplementation; T-Lymphocyte; therapy development; Time; Tissues; Training Support; Treatment Protocols; tumor; tumorigenesis; Ulcerative Colitis; United States National Institutes of Health; uptake; Urine; Veterans; Weight; Work; ","Eotaxin in Colitis and Colitis-Associated Carcinogenesis","002126","GAST","Gastroenterology ","","","05","","","",""

The proposed research focuses on how to overcome this problem ultimately resulting in an effective AIDS vaccine. As such, it is relevant to the NIH mission of developing a safe and effective AIDS vaccine.               Project 1: Mechanism of Anti-Gp120 Antibody Persistence     Project Leader: DeVico, A          DESCRIPTION (as provided by applicant): Recent clinical trials and a host of nonhuman primate studies have pushed the HIV vaccine field further toward the development of concepts based on humoral anti-HIV envelope immunity. However, such efforts face a major hurdle in that the routinely short-lived humoral responses to HIV envelope antigens will severely compromise HIV vaccine efficacy. An additional caveat is that any solution to the humoral persistence problem must include balanced immune responses that do not engender forms of CD4+ T cell activation that might increase HIV infection risk. The recent RV144 clinical trial of a  poxvirus/ envelope protein regimen underscores the issue in humans. In this trial, anti-gp120 antibody responses, including those linked with partial efficacy, decayed to undetectable levels within 12 months. Based on the available literature, we hypothesize that anti-gp120 titers rapidly fade in this manner because 1) HIV gp120-specific plasma cells are extensively killed during the germinal center reaction or 2) HIV gp120-specific plasma cells survive the germinal center reaction but cannot move into the bone marrow to become long-lived cells. Theoretically, these questions can be addressed by comparative analyses of vaccine regimens that yield persistent antibody titers versus ones that do not. This strategy has been hampered by a paucity of regimens that reliably yield persistent anti-gp120 humoral responses. Our group has tested the same gp120-based antigen in a wide variety of adjuvant formulations and vaccination regimens in macaques. Recently we determined that one of these regimens, which involves coimmunizing with envelope protein in adjuvant along with electroporation of DNA encoding IL-12 (herein termed DNA/protein coimmunization), generates significantly more persistent antibody titers compared to any other approach we tested. These findings now provide the necessary means to conduct comparative studies that elucidate the determinants for persistent anti-gp120 antibody responses. Accordingly, this Project will juxtapose the DNA/protein coimmunization regimen with a matched protein/adjuvant regimen that yields non-persistent responses. Our proposed comparative analyses will be driven by the two hypotheses listed above. In two specific aims, we will address whether persistent anti-HIV antibody responses are distinguished by 1) the preservation of short-term anti-gp120 plasmablasts without the enhancement of long-lived plasma cells in the bone marrow or 2) the establishment of long-lived anti-gp120 plasma cells in the bone marrow. We will also exploit the multifaceted nature of DNA/protein coimmunization to Identify vaccine components and associated immunological pathways that afford persistent humoral anti-gp120 responses, desirable CD4+ T cell profiles and protective efficacy against heterologous SHIV challenge. Information from this project should have significant impact, providing broadly applicable, immune-based underpinnings for the development of vaccine regimens that provide persistent anti-envelope antibody responses.","6837901; ","GALLO, ROBERT C;","SCHULTZ, ALAN M.","08/15/2016","07/31/2020","Achievement; Address; Adjuvant; AIDS Vaccine Development; AIDS Vaccines; Antibodies; Antibody Response; Antibody titer measurement; Antibody-mediated protection; Antigens; arm; Attenuated; base; Biological Preservation; Bone Marrow; CCR5 gene; CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes; Cells; Chickenpox; Clinical Trials; comparative; Comparative Study; Data; design; Development; DNA; efficacy trial; Electroporation; Elements; env Gene Products; Environment; Equilibrium; Face; Formulation; Foundations; Glycoproteins; Goals; HIV; HIV Antibodies; HIV Envelope Protein gp120; HIV Infections; HIV vaccine; Human; IgG3; Immune; Immune response; Immunity; Immunization; Immunize; Immunologics; Infection; Innate Immune Response; Interleukin-12; Killings; Lead; Link; Literature; Macaca; Macaca mulatta; Mediating; Mission; Modeling; Nature; nonhuman primate; novel strategies; Outcome; Passive Immunization; Pathway interactions; Phenotype; Plasma Cells; Plasmablast; Play; Population; Poxviridae; programs; prophylactic; protective efficacy; Proteins; Protocols documentation; Public Health; public health relevance; Publishing; Reaction; Regimen; Reporting; Research; Research Personnel; response; Risk; seropositive; simian human immunodeficiency virus; Site; Solid; Structure of germinal center of lymph node; T-Lymphocyte; Testing; Time; transmission process; United States National Institutes of Health; Vaccination; vaccine candidate; Vaccine Design; vaccine development; vaccine efficacy; vaccine evaluation; vaccine trial; Vaccines; vector; Virus-like particle; Work; ","Durable Antibody Mediated Protection Against HIV","124912","ZAI1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","3893529","500877","4394406",""

Bacille de Calmette et Guérin (BCG), the only TB prophylactic vaccine licensed, is 80% effective against extra-pulmonary TB, but has variable efficacy against pulmonary TB, the site of primary TB infection. The immune defenses generated by BCG protect against the spread of TB within the lungs and from the lungs to the rest of the body, but allow the TB microbe to remain dormant in the lungs. A big handicap in the development of TB vaccines more effective than BCG is that the mechanism of protection against dormant pulmonary TB is incompletely understood. In this study, we will investigate immune defenses against TB that may prevent the agent of TB to establish dormancy in the lungs.","2134021; ","WEINBERG, ADRIANA ;","EICHELBERG, KATRIN ","08/08/2017","07/31/2019","Abbreviations; Adult; analytical tool; Antigens; Biological Assay; Cellular Immunity; Characteristics; cohort; Communicable Diseases; Cytometry; Data Set; design; Development; Disabled Persons; Disease; effective therapy; Enrollment; Exposure to; Flow Cytometry; global health; Goals; Immune; Immunity; Immunologic Memory; Immunologics; India; Individual; Infection; Infection prevention; instrument; Interferons; latent infection; Longevity; Lung; Measures; Mediating; Medical; medical schools; Memory; Microbe; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Natural Immunity; novel vaccines; Observational Study; Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell; prevent; Preventive vaccine; prospective; protective effect; Protocols documentation; Public Health; Pulmonary Tuberculosis; reactivation from latency; Recruitment Activity; Research; response; Rest; Role; Sampling; Site; Sterility; Systems Biology; T cell response; T-Lymphocyte; Technology; Testing; Time; tool; tool development; Tuberculin Test; Tuberculosis; tuberculosis treatment; Tuberculosis Vaccines; tumor; United States National Institutes of Health; Vaccination; vaccine candidate; vaccine development; vaccine-induced immunity; Vaccines; Virus; ","The role of innate immunity in the acquisition of sterile protection against TB infection","134129","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","151789","70283","222072",""

In Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS), a heterogeneous group of malignant hematopoietic disorders, DNA methylation abnormalities play a pivotal role in MDS progression to Acute Myeloid Leukemia (rate of ~30 percent). Thus, demethylating drugs are being used in the clinic to treat MDS. However, these drugs have high toxicity and are not gene specific. We propose a novel approach to identify aberrantly methylated genes which are the 'drivers' of malignant cell transformation and to test a novel gene-specific, low toxic method for correcting aberrant DNA methylation in cancer and other diseases triggered by aberrant DNA methylation.","10070426; ","DI RUSCIO, ANNALISA ;","MUFSON, R.

In veterans the percent is much higher (20%) given the high number of patients with diabetes and hypertension, both underlying causes of CKD. Patients with CKD have a high risk of death, which increases with the progression of the disease, and half of these deaths are attributed to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Treatment with drugs affecting cholesterol metabolism are effectively used in the general population to decrease the risk of CVD events and death, but their role is insufficiently studied in CKD. A comprehensive study of the relationship between cholesterol and cholesterol sub fractions with the risk of CVD and death in CKD patients is necessary in order to create a clear and unified view about the way drugs affecting cholesterol should be used in these patients. In addition, it is essential for veterans with CKD to individualize the treatment, using data obtained in different age and racial-ethnic subgroups.","11506739; ","STREJA, ELANI ;","","07/01/2016","06/30/2021","Address; advanced disease; Affect; African American; Age; Area; Atherosclerosis; Award; base; Benefits and Risks; Cardiovascular Diseases; cardiovascular disorder epidemiology; cardiovascular disorder risk; cardiovascular risk factor; Cardiovascular system; career; Cessation of life; Cholesterol; Cholesterol Homeostasis; Chronic Kidney Failure; Clinical; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials; clinically significant; cohort; Comorbidity; Conflict (Psychology); Data; design; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; Dialysis procedure; Disease; Disease Outcome; Disease Progression; disorder risk; Dose; Dyslipidemias; Effectiveness; Environment; epidemiologic data; Epidemiologist; Ethnic Origin; Event; evidence base; Expenditure; experience; Fenofibrate; Fibrates; Future; Gender; General Population; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Guidelines; Health; Healthcare; Healthcare Systems; High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol; high risk; Hispanics; Hypertension; Hypertriglyceridemia; improved; individualized medicine; innovation; Intervention; K-Series Research Career Programs; Kidney; Knowledge; LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins; Lead; Lipids; Mentors; Mentorship; Metabolic syndrome; Methodology; Minority; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; multidisciplinary; Nephrology; Nicotinic Acids; novel; Outcome; Patient Care; patient population; Patient risk; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacotherapy; Physicians; Physiology; Population; Prevalence; Prevention; Proteinuria; public health relevance; Publishing; Quality of life; Race; racial and ethnic; Randomized Controlled Trials; Research Personnel; Risk; Risk Factors; Role; Safety; Scientist; Solid; statistics; Subgroup; Therapeutic; Training; Training Programs; Translating; Triglycerides; Uncertainty; United States; Veterans; ","Lipid Profiles and Management in Veterans with Chronic Kidney Disease","001266","EPID","Epidemiology ","","","02","","","",""

This deficiency results in many problems including breathing difficulties and the need for mechanical ventilators. The only FDA approved treatment for Pompe disease (enzyme replacement therapy) fails to treat the breathing problems. We hypothesize that part of the reason that breathing problems are common in Pompe disease is that brainstem neurons and spinal cord motoneurons fail to adequately control the respiratory muscles. This application targets the respiratory neurons in Pompe disease using novel drugs called ampakines and couples them with gene therapy using adeno- associated virus (AAV).","10807538; ","ELMALLAH, MAI KAMAL;","PARISI, MELISSA ","09/15/2014","04/30/2019","Address; Affect; AMPA Receptors; Automobile Driving; Award; base; Biochemical; Blood; Blood - brain barrier anatomy; Brain; Brain Stem; Breathing; career; career development; Caring; Childhood; Clinical; Clinical Treatment; Clinical Trials; Couples; Data; Defect; Dependovirus; design; Disease; Disease Progression; Education; Employee; enzyme deficiency; enzyme replacement therapy; Enzymes; Evaluation; experimental study; Failure; FDA approved; Feedback; Fellowship; Florida; Functional disorder; Funding; gallium arsenide; Gene Delivery; gene therapy; Genes; Glucan 1,4-alpha-Glucosidase; Glycogen; Glycogen Storage Disease; Glycogen storage disease type II; Goals; Grant; Histologic; Human; Hypercapnic respiratory failure; Impairment; Infant; Injection of therapeutic agent; innovation; Intramuscular Injections; Knowledge; Laboratories; Leadership; Learning; Lung; Mechanical ventilation; Mechanical Ventilators; meetings; Mentors; Metabolic; Molecular; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; motor disorder; Motor Neurons; Motor output; mouse model; Mus; Muscle; Mutation; NCI Scholars Program; Neuraxis; Neurobiology; neuromechanism; neuromuscular; Neuromuscular Diseases; Neuronal Dysfunction; Neurons; novel; novel strategies; novel therapeutics; Opiates; Output; Pathology; Patients; pediatric cardiologist; pediatric department; Pediatrics; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase; preclinical study; professor; programs; public health relevance; Publishing; relating to nervous system; Reporting; Research; Research Methodology; Research Personnel; Research Project Grants; Resources; Respiration; respiratory; Respiratory Diaphragm; Respiratory Insufficiency; Respiratory Muscles; Respiratory physiology; Respiratory Therapy; Scientist; Series; Signal Transduction; Single-Gene Defect; skills; Sleep; Spinal Cord; Structure; Synaptic Transmission; Techniques; Testing; Text; Therapeutic Agents; Time; Tongue; Training; Translating; Translational Research; Treatment Efficacy; United States National Institutes of Health; Universities; Viral; Work; Writing; ","Novel Approaches for Correcting Respiratory Insufficiency in Pompe Disease","077040","CHHD","Biobehavioral and Behavioral Sciences Subcommittee ","","","05","150200","11936","162136",""

The long-term goal of this project is to meet the great need to prevent and treat bone infection by developing bone-targeted therapies designed to deliver and concentrate antibiotic drugs at the sites of bone infection, such as osteomyelitis.","8640815; 8499869 (contact); ","THAMM, DOUGLAS H; ZINNEN, SHAWN PATRICK (contact);","XU, ZUOYU ","08/07/2017","07/31/2019","Address; Adverse event; Aerobic; Affinity; aggressive therapy; Amputation; Anaerobic Bacteria; Anti-Infective Agents; Antibiotic Therapy; Antibiotics; Antineoplastic Agents; Automobile Driving; Bacterial Model; base; Binding; bisphosphonate; Blood Circulation; Blood Vessels; bone; Bone Diseases; Bone Resorption; bone turnover; Cancer Patient; Chemicals; Chronic; Ciprofloxacin; Clindamycin; clinical application; clinically relevant; Cytarabine; Debridement; design; Deterioration; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; Dose; Drug Approval; Drug Design; Drug Kinetics; Elements; fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography; Fluoroquinolones; Generations; Goals; Growth; Histology; Histopathology; Human; Ibandronate; imaging biomarker; improved; In Vitro; in vitro testing; in vivo; Infection; inorganic phosphate; Intravenous; Investigational Drugs; Lead; Lesion; lincosamide; Link; Luciferases; Malignant Neoplasms; Measurement; Metastatic Neoplasm to the Bone; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; Methods; microCT; Modeling; Morbidity - disease rate; mouse model; novel; Nucleosides; Operative Surgical Procedures; Organism; Osteomyelitis; Patient Care; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase; Phase I Clinical Trials; Preparation; prevent; Procedures; Property; Recurrence; Renal clearance function; Reporting; Risk; scale up; Serious Adverse Event; Serum; Sickle Cell; Site; Staphylococcus aureus; success; Systemic infection; systemic toxicity; targeted treatment; Technology; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Agents; therapy design; Time; Toxic effect; Trauma; Trauma patient; Work; X-Ray Computed Tomography; ","Bone Targeted Antibiotics","127359","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","01","","","300000",""

The antimalarial pyronaridine, a structural analog of amodiaquine, was identified by a computational repurposing strategy and further shown to have an EC50 of 420 nM against EBOV in vitro. We now propose to fully characterize this compound using standard preclinical ADME assays prior to mouse pharmacokinetic analysis, determine broad-spectrum applicability against multiple EBOV strains and ultimately in vivo efficacy testing in the mouse Ebola virus model prior to testing in a non-human primate model.

The proposed study will reveal how MCU regulation by mitochondrial matrix Mg2+ preserves cardiomyocytes from pathological insults.","12553572; ","SHANMUGHAPRIYA, SANTHANAM ;","WANG, WAYNE C.","08/09/2017","07/31/2019","Affinity; Attenuated; base; Binding; Binding Sites; Biochemical Process; Bioenergetics; Biological; Biological Models; Buffers; Calcium; calcium uniporter; Cardiac; Cardiac Myocytes; Cations; Cell Death; Cell membrane; Cell model; cell type; Cells; Cessation of life; Complex; Coupling; CRISPR/Cas technology; Crystallization; Data; Disease; Divalent Cations; Energy Metabolism; Energy Supply; Ensure; Equilibrium; Event; Exhibits; F0 ATPase; Failure; Feedback; gain of function; Gene Targeting; Generations; Genome Stability; grasp; Heart; Heart Diseases; Homeostasis; Individual; Injury; Inositol; insight; Ions; Kinetics; Knock-in; Knock-out; Knowledge; Link; Magnesium; Mediating; Membrane; Metabolic; Metabolism; Mitochondria; Mitochondrial Matrix; mitochondrial metabolism; Molecular; monomer; Muscle Cells; mutant; mutant mouse model; Myocardial Infarction; Myocardium; N-terminal; Necrosis; Oxidative Phosphorylation; Oxidoreductase; Pathologic; Pathology; Patients; Physiological; Physiological Processes; Physiology; Play; Positioning Attribute; Potassium Channel; Protein Family; Proteins; Publishing; receptor; Recurrence; Regulation; Reproducibility; Role; Ryanodine Receptors; Site; Structural Protein; Structure; Survivors; System; Therapeutic; tripolyphosphate; uptake; Workload; ","Molecular link between MCU and Mrs2p channels for mitochondrial ion homeostasis and energy metabolism","138268","MTI","NHLBI Mentored Transition to Independence Review Committee ","","","01","93077","7446","100523",""

The major objective of this program is to address the burden of occupational safety and health among fire fighters by providing state of the art training by translating scientific discoveries into practice through effective education, training, and outreach. The IAFF recognizes that every emergency call is a potential hazardous materials (HazMat) call. Each year thousands of fire fighters are exposed to chemical and biological hazards in the performances of their duties. The IAFF understands that training students in hazards, defensive actions, and to OSHA and NFPA standards can help minimize and eliminate exposures. Our mission is to train all levels of firefighters in their own departments and customize the training to jurisdictional hazards. IAFF programs are developed and taught by highly trained fire fighters who bring valuable experience to the classroom. IAFF training efforts have proven to reduce risk and protect fire fighters safety and health through effective training.","11658228; ","HARMAN, ELIZABETH MARIE;","MAPLES, ELIZABETH ","07/01/2017","06/30/2022","","Emergency Responder Training Program","009230","ZOH1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","11","","","1137600",""

Furthermore, coronary vascular disease is a primary cause of mortality in this patient population.

The inadequacy of current therapies presents an unmet need of immense commercial opportunity. CRS patients are known to have reduced nitric oxide (NO) levels in their sinus cavities, which contribute to the formation of microbial biofilm that cannot be eradicated by antibiotics. Phase 1 research has demonstrated the effectiveness of NOTA Laboratories' new sinonasal spray/rinse solution containing S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) that releases low levels of NO capable of reducing microbial biofilm grown on the surface of human epithelial cells without exhibiting any toxicity toward the human cells. In Phase II, further development of this product is proposed, including additional optimization of a dry powder formulation, commercial packaging studies, animal experiments, and exploring the regulatory issues required for the eventual launch of a new product that will have a profound impact on the prevention/treatment of CRS for many patients. !","14466387 (contact); 8760015; ","MARTIN, GLENN  (contact); SAJJAN, UMADEVI SIVANAPPA;","MINNICOZZI, MICHAEL ","07/15/2015","07/31/2019","Adult; Aerosols; Affect; Aluminum; Animal Experiments; Animals; Antibiotics; antimicrobial; antimicrobial drug; Antimicrobial Effect; Antiviral Agents; ascorbate; Ascorbic Acid; Bacteria; Bacterial Counts; base; Bicarbonates; Blood; Blood Circulation; Cell Line; Cells; chronic rhinosinusitis; Clinical Trials; Common Cold; cost; cytokine; Data; Detection; Direct Costs; Disease; Dose; economic impact; Edetic Acid; effective therapy; Effectiveness; Epithelial Cells; Exhalation; Exhibits; experimental study; Expert Opinion; Film; Flushing; Formulation; Frequencies; Funding; Generations; Glutathione; Healthcare; Histologic; Hour; Human; human subject; IL8 gene; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; Individual; innovative technologies; Isotonic Exercise; Laboratories; Laboratory Animal Medicine; Literature; Measures; Michigan; Microbe; microbial; Microbial Biofilms; Modeling; Monitor; Mucociliary Clearance; Mucous Membrane; natural antimicrobial; Nitric Oxide; Nose; Oryctolagus cuniculus; Patients; Pennsylvania; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase; phase 1 study; phase 3 study; Plasticizers; Polymers; Population; Powder dose form; pre-clinical; prevent; Prevention; Process; product development; Productivity; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; reconstitution; Reducing Agents; Research; rhinosinusitis; Risk; Role; S-Nitrosoglutathione; S-Nitrosothiols; Saline; Sinus; Small Business Innovation Research Grant; Specialist; Staphylococcus aureus; Surface; Technology; Test Result; Testing; Time; Toxic effect; treatment duration; Universities; Visit; Water; ","S-Nitrosothiol-Based Rinse/Aerosol Solutions for Treatment/Prevention of Rhinosinusitis (Phase II)","120443","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","02","","","858200",""

This project is aimed at identifying potentially causal DNA methylation markers for breast cancer development through an integrative genomic and epidemiological approach that combines the regulation of DNA methylation in normal breast tissue and differential DNA methylation profiling in normal and tumor breast tissue. This information is critical not only for understanding breast cancer biology, but also for developing novel, more effective prevention and treatment strategies that target causal DNA methylation.","9152491; ","HE, CHUNYAN ;","VERMA, MUKESH ","07/05/2017","06/30/2019","Aberrant DNA Methylation; Age; Age at Menarche; anticancer research; biobank; Biological Process; Body mass index; Breast Cancer Risk Factor; Cancer Biology; Cancer Center; Cancer Etiology; cancer initiation; cancer risk; cell type; Complex; Data; Development; Diet; DNA Methylation; DNA Methylation Regulation; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Risk Factor; Epidemiology; epigenetic marker; Epigenetic Process; epigenome-wide association studies; Epithelial Cells; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetic; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genetic Risk; genetic variant; Genetic Variation; genome wide methylation; genome-wide; genomic variation; Genomics; Hormone use; Indiana; Individual; Lead; Life Style; malignant breast neoplasm; Malignant Neoplasms; Mammary Gland Parenchyma; Mammary Neoplasms; Menopause; Methylation; methylation biomarker; Modification; Molecular Profiling; non-genetic; Normal tissue morphology; novel; novel strategies; Oncogene Activation; Oncogene Deregulation; parity; Play; Positioning Attribute; Prevention strategy; prospective; public health relevance; Quantitative Trait Loci; Regulation; Research; Resources; Risk Factors; Role; Site; Specimen; Testing; Time; Tissue Banks; Tissues; treatment strategy; tumor; tumor progression; Tumor Tissue; Tumor-Suppressor Gene Inactivation; tumorigenesis; Universities; Variant; Woman; ","An Integrative Approach to Identify Causal Epigenetic Markers for Breast Cancer","194030","CBSS","Cancer Biomarkers Study Section ","","","03","228750","100194","328944",""
