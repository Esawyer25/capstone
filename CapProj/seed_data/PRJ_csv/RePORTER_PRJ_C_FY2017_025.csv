SPECIFIC AIMS PROJECT RELEVANCE As the population ages and life expectancy grows longer, policy makers and citizens are concerned that our extra years should be healthy, productive, and enjoyable, not extra years of disease and disability. Finding new strategies to prevent age-related disease and disability requires research to identify risk factors in early- to-midlife that can be ameliorated or reversed and also research to test effectiveness of these amelioration strategies. This research agenda depends on reliable and valid measurements of biological aging during midlife ? before the onset of age-related disease. Ideal laboratories for developing such measurements are studies that have followed cohorts longitudinally over time during midlife, including the Dunedin Study. The proposed work will improve knowledge by generating findings about reliability and validity of tools to quantify biological aging in midlife. Findings are expected to support future randomized clinical trials of midlife interventions intended to reverse the effects of early-life adversity, prevent age-related diseases, and enhance wellbeing in late life.","10592558; ","BELSKY, DANIEL WALKER;","KOHANSKI, RONALD A.","03/15/2017","02/28/2019","Age; Age Distribution; age related; Aging; Aging-Related Process; Agreement; Algorithms; Archives; biobank; Biological; Biological Aging; Biological Markers; Biological Process; Birth; Blood; body-mind; Cessation of life; Chronic Disease; Clinical; clinical biomarkers; Clinical Trials; cognitive function; cohort; Data; Data Set; Databases; Deterioration; disability; Disabled Persons; Disease; DNA Methylation; Effectiveness; Elderly; Factor Analysis; fly; follow-up; frailty; functional disability; Future; Genetic Transcription; genome-wide; Genomics; head-to-head comparison; Health; Human; human study; Impaired cognition; improved; indexing; Individual; Intervention; Intervention Studies; Intervention Trial; Knowledge; Laboratories; Lead; Life; Life Expectancy; Life Experience; Light; Literature; Longevity; longitudinal analysis; Longitudinal Studies; Measurement; Measures; Methods; Methylation; middle age; Molecular Profiling; Monitor; mortality; Mus; non-genomic; Outcome; peer; Perception; Persons; Physical Function; Physiological Processes; Pilot Projects; Policy Maker; Population; prevent; Process; Process Measure; Productivity; prospective; Publishing; Randomized Clinical Trials; randomized trial; Research; Risk; Risk Factors; Sampling; Speed; telomere; Testing; theories; therapy development; Time; tool; Translating; Translations; Validity and Reliability; whole genome; Work; Yeasts; young adult; ","A pilot study to advance translation of molecular signatures of biological aging","054846","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","150000","88500","238500",""

P. Overington et al. (2006) Nat. Rev. Drug. Disc. 5, 993-996). Because the majority of pharmaceuticals target GPCRs, unraveling the mechanism GPCR function and activation is clearly of great interest for medicine and the society at large. Our approach uses solid-state NMR spectroscopy in combination with molecular dynamics simulations to uncover the molecular motions that underlie triggering of the visual process. We will discover how rhodopsin achieves the extreme high fidelity required for visual signaling. The methodological developments will set the foundation for future investigations of rhodopsin mutants in debilitating visual diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa. Our robust and novel approach will give us important insights that are transferable to the broader class of GPCRs in human biology and pharmacology.  Our studies will test new hypotheses about the ways that rhodopsin becomes activated by light, yielding the interaction with the signaling protein transducin. Human hereditary blindness can be understood through structural studies of rhodopsin. Extending the approach to other GPCRs can stimulate ligand-based drug discovery. More than a hundred mutants of human rhodopsin have been identified in patients afflicted with eye diseases, such as macular degeneration, congenital night blindness, and retinitis pigmentosa (A. Rattner et al. (1999) Ann. Rev. Gen. 33, 89-131). Losses of receptor-G protein binding can contribute to the dysfunctions of essential fatty deficiency, including losses in cognitive skills and learning, spatial and odor discrimination, and visual acuity (N. Salem et al. (2001) Lipids 36, 945-959). Furthermore, about 10% of individuals 65-75 years of age have macular degeneration, which increases to 30% for patients 75-85 years of age. Here the loss of central vision profoundly affects the inability to read texts or distinguish faces-for elderly people this can be devastating. Such non-communicable, age-related diseases are becoming increasingly prevalent in Western societies. They represent a societal burden that urgently must be addressed (National Institute on Aging, 2007 'Why Population Aging Matters').  The combination of our novel NMR methods with molecular dynamics computer simulations has a huge potential for biological insights of far-reaching significance (N. Leioatts et al. (2014) Biochemistry 53, 376?385). We will apply these technologies to the discovery of the dynamic structural changes in the native photosequence of rhodopsin. It will allow us for the first time to peer into the shape changes of rhodopsin that underlie the process of visual signaling. A product of this work will be a molecular dynamics movie showing rhodopsin activation in vivid detail, which will be disseminated to the public at large for educational purposes. Indeed, the GPCR field is entering its most exciting phase: molecular information together with modern spectroscopic approaches brings us closer to revealing and understanding the processes of biological signaling.","7780342; ","BROWN, MICHAEL F;","NEUHOLD, LISA ","03/01/2016","02/28/2019","Address; Affect; Affinity; age related; Age-Years; aging population; Agonist; Apoproteins; base; Binding; Binding Proteins; Biochemistry; Biological; Biological Process; Biology; Catalysis; Cellular Membrane; cofactor; cognitive skill; Computer Simulation; Coupled; Coupling; dark matter; Data; Development; Dimensions; Discrimination; Disease; drug discovery; Elderly; Electronics; Encapsulated; Environment; Equilibrium; Event; Eye diseases; Face; Family; flexibility; Foundations; Fourier Transform; Functional disorder; Future; G-Protein-Coupled Receptors; Goals; Grant; GTP-Binding Proteins; Health; hereditary blindness; Human; Human Biology; Hydration status; Hydrogen Bonding; Individual; innovation; insight; interest; Investigation; Learning; Length; Ligands; Light; Lipid Bilayers; Lipids; Macular degeneration; Magnetic Resonance; Mechanics; Mediating; Medicine; Membrane; Membrane Lipids; Membrane Proteins; metarhodopsin; Methods; Modeling; Molecular; Molecular Conformation; molecular dynamics; molecular size; Motion; Movement; movie; mutant; National Institute on Aging; Night Blindness; NMR Spectroscopy; novel; novel strategies; Odors; Opsin; Organism; Osmotic Pressure; Patients; peer; peptide analog; Peptides; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacologic Substance; Pharmacology; Phase; Photochemistry; Photons; Physiological; polyunsaturated fat; Property; Protein Dynamics; Proteins; prototype; Reading; receptor; Receptor Activation; receptor function; Relaxation; Research; research study; restraint; Retinal; retinal rods; Retinitis Pigmentosa; Retinoids; Rhodopsin; Roentgen Rays; Role; Shapes; Signal Transduction; Signaling Protein; simulation; Site; Societies; solid state; solid state nuclear magnetic resonance; Spectrum Analysis; Spin Labels; Stress; Structure; Study models; Surface; Technology; Temperature; temporal measurement; Testing; Text; Time; Transducin; Vision; Visual; Visual Acuity; visual excitation; visual process; visual processing; Visual Signal Transduction Pathway; Water; Work; ","MEMBRANE BASIS OF VISUAL EXCITATION","026041","MSFB","Macromolecular Structure and Function B Study Section ","","","02","225000","103617","328617",""

This proposal takes advantage of a rare opportunity to directly interrogate human brain function invasively to elucidate the mechanisms involved in spatiotemporal integration.

The risk of sudden cardiac arrest among dialysis patients is 30 times higher than the population average.

These findings can inform the development of methods to optimize human birth.","1874015; ","CARTER, CAROL SUE;","","","","Accounting; Adult; Affect; Aftercare; Aggressive behavior; Anhedonia; Animal Model; Animals; Anxiety; Argipressin; base; Behavior; Behavioral; Birth; Blood - brain barrier anatomy; Brain region; Brain Stem; brain tissue; Data; design; Development; Devices; Discipline of obstetrics; DNA; DNA Methylation; Dose; Elderly; Emotions; Enzyme Immunoassay; Epigenetic Process; experience; Exposure to; Female; Fostering; Genes; Gonadal Hormones; Heart Rate; Hormonal; Human; Hypothalamic structure; Image; immunocytochemistry; Implant; indexing; Infant; Instruction; Intervention; juvenile animal; Knowledge; Life; male; Maternal Behavior; Measures; Medical; Mental Depression; method development; Modeling; Mothers; Neuraxis; Neurosecretory Systems; Nucleus Accumbens; Odors; offspring; Outcome; Oxytocin; Oxytocin Receptor; Pair Bond; Peptides; Perinatal; Physiological; Physiology; Plasma; postnatal; prairie vole; preference; Pregnancy; premature; prevent; Process; pup; Radio; receptor; Regulation; relating to nervous system; Research; respiratory; response; Rodent Model; Role; Saline; Same-sex; Sampling; Siblings; Sinus Arrhythmia; social; Social Behavior; Stimulus; stressor; Sucrose; Telemetry; Testing; Time; Tissues; Vasopressins; ","Animal Paradigm, Behavior, Neuroendocrine and Autonomics","075750","ZHD1","Special Emphasis Panel ","8179","","05","402688","21982","","424670"

This proposed technology relies on the use of clinically available dextrans and a label-free MRI method that directly detects dextrans via the MRI signal inherently carried by hydroxyl protons using a technique called chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST). Thus, there is no need for extra chemical-, paramagnetic-, or radioactive- imaging labeling.

Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in the lung plays a key role in allergic asthmatic inflammation. Studies of Xolair have shown that IgE is a central mediator of asthmatic inflammation in human allergic asthma. Administration of Xolair is known to improve severe asthmatic syndromes of inner city asthmatics by ameliorating IgE-mediated responses and reducing IgE-amplified innate immunity to pathogenic house dust mites (HDM), cockroaches, and pet allergens (NEJM, 2011). A seminal finding of downregulating IgE by active immunization was first reported in our lab. This led to the product concept of the mAb anti-IgE omalizumab, and a subsequent collaboration with the pharmaceutical industry led to the FDA approval of the product, Xolair. IgE binding loops to FceRI on mast cells (e.g., the Xolair binding FG loop epitope) that are appropriately conformationally-constrained can serve as a therapeutic pan-IgE supersite active vaccine for eliciting broadly neutralizing (BN) anti-IgE antibodies to neutralize as well as to remove IgE from cells and inflammatory tissues. Therefore. this phase 2 Project aims to develop a BN pan-IgE supersite vaccine. The high cost of Xolair ($15,000 to $35,000 per patient) limits its availability to only ~50,000 severe asthmatics, while the low vaccine cost renders it affordable to ~ 30 million patients with mild, moderate, moderate to severe, and severe allergic asthma in the US. Therefore, developing this innovative pan-IgE vaccine product will meet the market need.","7537787; ","CHEN, SWEY-SHEN ;","MINNICOZZI, MICHAEL ","03/01/2017","02/28/2020","Active Immunization; Adult asthma; Affinity; airway inflammation; Allergens; Allergic; Amino Acid Sequence; Anaphylaxis; Antibodies; Antigen-Antibody Complex; Asthma; asthmatic; asthmatic patient; B-Lymphocytes; base; Basophils; Binding; Blocking Antibodies; Blood Circulation; CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes; Cell Line; Cells; Child; Chronic; Collaborations; Competence; Complex; cost; dander; Dendritic Cells; Dictyoptera; Diffusion; DNA Sequencing Facility; Down-Regulation; Drug Industry; Ensure; eosinophil; Epithelial Cells; Epitopes; Excision; Exhibits; Extrinsic asthma; Half-Life; Household; Human; Hypersensitivity; Hypersensitivity skin testing; IgE; IgE Receptors; Imiquimod; Immunization; immunogenic; immunogenicity; Immunoglobulin A; Immunoglobulin G; improved; Inflammation; Inflammatory; inner city; innovation; Location; Lung; Macaca; Macaca mulatta; Marketing; mast cell; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; meetings; Modality; Modeling; Molecular Conformation; Mus; Natural Immunity; neutrophil; omalizumab; Patients; Phase; Play; prevent; Product Approvals; Pyroglyphidae; receptor binding; Recovery; Reporting; respiratory smooth muscle; response; Rest; Reticuloendothelial System; Risk; Rodent; Rodent Model; Route; Safety; Saline; Scaffolding Protein; Secretory Immunoglobulin A; Seminal; Serum; Smooth Muscle Myocytes; Source; subcutaneous; Syndrome; Testing; Therapeutic; Time; Tissues; Translations; Ursidae Family; Urticaria; Vaccinated; Vaccination; vaccine efficacy; Vaccines; Xolair; ","Broadly neutralizing(BN) pan-IgE supersite vaccine for allergic asthma","126680","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","01","","","813544",""

We focus on eukaryotic and human membrane proteins because of their roles in diseases, here including viral infection, lysosomal diseases, glucose acquisition and autoimmunity.","1858415; ","STROUD, ROBERT M;","CHIN, JEAN ","04/01/1979","12/31/2020","abstracting; Address; Affect; Affinity; Animals; Antibodies; aquaporin 4; Autoimmune Process; Autoimmunity; Automobile Driving; base; Binding; Biological; Biological Assay; Biological Response Modifier Therapy; Biological Transport; Brain; Brain Diseases; Calcium ion; cancer therapy; Cell membrane; Cells; central nervous system injury; Chemicals; Complex; Coupled; Coupling; Cryoelectron Microscopy; design; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; Disease; Drug Modulation; Ebola virus; EF-Hand Domain; Electrophysiology (science); Epitopes; Eukaryotic Cell; Fab Immunoglobulins; FRAP1 gene; fungus; Ganglioside Sialidase Deficiency Disease; Glucose; Glucose Transporter; Goals; Growth; Human; human disease; improved; Individual; Infection; inhibitor/antagonist; innovation; inorganic phosphate; Inorganic Phosphate Transporter; Integral Membrane Protein; Intervention; Ion Channel; Ion Transport; Ions; Lactose; lactose permease; Lead; Ligands; loss of function; Lysosomal Storage Diseases; Malignant Neoplasms; member; Membrane; Membrane Proteins; Molecular; Molecular Conformation; Molecular Structure; Motion; Mus; Mutagenesis; mutant; Mutation; Neuromyelitis Optica; Neurons; Nutrient; Parkinson Disease; pathogen; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phosphorylation; Phosphotransferases; Plants; Poisons; prevent; Process; Property; prospective; Protein Conformation; Protons; receptor; Regulation; Research; Resolution; Rest; Role; Route; sensor; Side; Signal Transduction; Sister; Site; Structure; sugar; symporter; Technology; Testing; Therapeutic; therapeutic development; Therapeutic Intervention; Time; trafficking; TRP channel; Vacuole; Virus; Virus Diseases; voltage; water channel; X ray diffraction analysis; X-Ray Crystallography; X-Ray Diffraction; Yeasts; ","Molecular Basis for Transmembrane Conduction & Signaling","024485","BBM","Biochemistry and Biophysics of Membranes Study Section ","","","40","440127","215741","655868",""

Access to SBF-SEM technology will greatly enhance the ability of Indiana University scientists to visualize the interior structures of cells and tissues, and thus answer fundamental biological questions previously out of reach.","1887675; ","INNES, ROGER W.;","LEVY, ABRAHAM ","03/15/2017","03/14/2018","Acetaminophen; Arboviruses; Brain; cell component structure; Cells; Cellular biology; Cellular Structures; Clinical; Complex; Data; Data Set; Development; Dimensions; Electron Microscope; Electron Microscopy; Evolution; extracellular vesicles; Eye Development; Face; Funding; Human; Image; Immune system; Indiana; Institutes; interest; Liver; liver injury; Mammalian Cell; Microscope; microscopic imaging; Microtome - medical device; Names; neural circuit; Pain; pathogen; Perception; Planet Earth; Plants; Plastic Embedding; Research; Research Personnel; Resolution; Role; Scanning; Scanning Electron Microscopy; Science; Services; Specimen; System; Technology; Thick; Three-Dimensional Image; Tissues; Toxoplasma gondii; Translations; United States National Institutes of Health; Universities; ","Serial Block Face Scanning Electron Microscope","023501","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","598638","","598638",""

This rising incidence most likely represents various environmental factors that influence disease in genetically susceptible individuals. While genetics of MS are beginning to be understood, how genetics interact with environmental factors remains an open question that is very difficult to address in human studies. Changes in the gut microbiome (the collection of trillions of bacteria that colonize the gut) represent a potential environmental risk factor in MS. We propose to use an animal model of MS to understand interactions between genetics and this environmental factor, employing a well-controlled powerful mouse genetics system. The gut microbiome represents a new frontier in human health and disease, as it could be used both diagnostically and therapeutically. However, cause and effect are difficult to separate in human studies, and our mouse studies will provide a critical frame work for the interpretation and application of the results from human studies.","10396955; ","KREMENTSOV, DIMITRY N;","UTZ, URSULA ","03/15/2017","01/31/2022","Accounting; Address; Affect; Animal Model; Antibiotic Therapy; Autoimmune Diseases; Autoimmune Process; Bacteria; care burden; Central Nervous System Diseases; Chromosomes; Clinical; CNS autoimmunity; Collection; Complex; congenic; consomic; Consomic Strain; Control Locus; Data; Demyelinations; Developed Countries; disability; Disease; Disease susceptibility; disorder risk; Ecosystem; Environment; Environmental Risk Factor; Epidemiologic Studies; Etiology; Evaluation; Exhibits; Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis; Female; Fostering; frontier; gene environment interaction; Gene Expression; Genes; Genetic; Genetic study; Genetic Variation; genome-wide; Germ-Free; Gliosis; Goals; gut microbiome; gut microbiota; Health; Healthcare; Housing; Human; human disease; Immune; Incidence; Individual; Inflammatory; Intestines; Laboratory mice; Link; male; Maps; microbiome; microbiota; microbiota transplantation; microorganism; Modeling; Mouse Strains; Multiple Sclerosis; multiple sclerosis patient; Mus; Neuraxis; neuroinflammation; Neurologic; Neurologic Dysfunctions; next generation; novel; Outcome; Phenotype; Physiology; Play; Population; Predisposition; Prevalence; rate of change; Risk; Risk Factors; Role; rRNA Genes; segregation; Severities; sex; Shapes; System; Testing; tool; transmission process; Variant; Work; young adult; ","Interactions Between Host Genetics and the Gut Microbiome in CNS Autoimmunity","097596","CIMG","Clinical, Integrative and Molecular Gastroenterology Study Section ","","A1","01","218750","121133","339883",""

Most concerning are the severe seizures and high risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Mutations in voltage-gated Na+ channel ? and ? subunit genes are linked to DS. While the majority of DS cases are linked to SCN1A haploinsufficiency, SCN1B homozygous mutations are also linked to DS. The objective of this work is to understand the mechanism of hyperexcitability in human SCN1B-linked DS. Even though SCN1B-linked DS is a rare disease, this work is important because it will provide new information regarding how deficits in brain development and regulation of ionic currents can synergize to result in hyperexcitability.","1904093; ","ISOM, LORI L.;","WHITTEMORE, VICKY R","02/01/2011","01/31/2021","Anions; Biopsy; Brain; Cell Adhesion; Cell Adhesion Molecules; Cell Line; cell type; Cells; Cerebrum; Childhood; Comorbidity; Data; Defect; Development; Developmental Delay Disorders; Disease; drug discovery; early onset; Electrophysiology (science); Epilepsy; epileptic encephalopathies; Extracellular Matrix; Family; Fibroblasts; Fluorescence; Future; GABA-A Receptor; Gene Deletion; Gene Mutation; Generations; Genes; high risk; hippocampal pyramidal neuron; Human; human disease; Immunoglobulins; Impaired cognition; in vivo; induced pluripotent stem cell; Inherited; Intellectual functioning disability; Ion Channel; Knockout Mice; Lead; Link; loss of function; migration; Modeling; mouse model; Mus; mutant; Mutation; Neurons; novel; Null Lymphocytes; Organoids; Parents; Patients; Phenotype; Play; postnatal; Preparation; proband; Rare Diseases; Regulation; Reporter; research study; response; Role; Seizures; Signal Transduction; Skin; Slice; sudden unexpected death in epilepsy; Synapses; Syndrome; Testing; Therapeutic Intervention; Time; Transgenic Mice; voltage; Work; ","Role of SCN1B in Inherited Epilepsy","076752","DBD","Developmental Brain Disorders Study Section ","","A1","05","465847","236493","702340",""

The World Health Organization expects 4 million Zika virus cases in the coming year. The mechanism by which Zika causes disease remains unknown but clearly results from Zika virus access to brain and fetal tissue. Brain blood vessels are lined with unique endothelial cells that form a blood brain barrier and normally prevent virus from entering the brain. We have found that Zika virus persistently infects brain and umbilical vein endothelial cells. This may explain Zika virus spread within patients and across endothelial cell barriers to fetal and neuronal tissue. This may also explain the longevity of ZV in human fluids that foster person to person spread. In this proposal we address Zika viruses regulation of primary human EC functions that result in persistent infection and permeability of the endothelium that permits ZV to bypass capillary barriers and damage fetal and neuronal tissues.","1886046; ","MACKOW, ERICH R;","REPIK, PATRICIA M.","03/15/2017","02/28/2019","Acute; Address; Adherence; Apoptosis; Biological Assay; Blood; Blood - brain barrier anatomy; Blood capillaries; Blood Vessels; Brain; brain tissue; Bypass; capillary; Capillary Permeability; Cell Line; Cell physiology; Cell Survival; Cells; cerebral capillary; Cerebrum; Cognitive deficits; Culicidae; Cytopathology; cytotoxicity; Dengue Virus; Disease; Encephalitis; Endothelial Cells; Endothelium; Evaluation; Family; fetal; fetal blood; Fetal Tissues; Figs - dietary; Flavivirus; Fostering; Genes; Guanosine Triphosphate Phosphohydrolases; Human; in vivo; Infection; inhibitor/antagonist; Interferon Type I; Interferon-alpha; Interferons; IRF3 gene; kinase inhibitor; knock-down; Ligands; Link; Liquid substance; Longevity; Lymphatic Endothelial Cells; Microcephaly; monolayer; Mus; neuron apoptosis; Neurons; novel; pathogen; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Patients; Permeability; Persons; Play; prevent; Primary Infection; Property; receptor; Regulation; response; rho; Rho-associated kinase; RNA Viruses; Role; Source; Staining method; Stains; Subfamily lentivirinae; TBK1 gene; Therapeutic; therapeutic target; Tissues; TNFSF10 gene; transmission process; Umbilical vein; Urine; Vascular blood supply; Vero Cells; Viral; Viral Nonstructural Proteins; Viral Proteins; viral transmission; Viremia; Virus; Virus Diseases; World Health Organization; Zika Virus; ","Role of Persistent Zika Virus Infection of Endothelial Cells in Pathogenesis","131729","ZAI1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","150000","85543","235543",""

Although the exact causes of alcohol addiction have yet to be fully elucidated, binge drinking during adolescence has been linked to an increased risk of developing alcoholism later in life. This relationship may be explained by ethanol-induced alterations in brain development during adolescence. We think that understanding how alcohol affects the adolescent brain might provide new insight into how alcohol addiction develops, and these insights might, in turn, lead to new treatments. This project focuses on the effects of alcohol on development of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a brain region that matures during adolescence. Using an animal model of binge drinking, these studies aim to discover how alcohol affects the excitability of neurons in the developing mPFC, and to develop new ways to reverse the consequences of adolescent drinking.","10624456; ","SKELLY, MARY JANE;","LIU, QI-YING ","03/01/2017","","","Impact of Adolescent Alcohol on Development of the Prefrontal Cortex","025530","ZAA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","54294","","54294",""

Recent studies indicate that T cells (a group of white blood cells that play a central role in immunity) contribut to hypertension. We have discovered that a male T cell subset contributes to hypertension while a female T cell subset attenuates hypertension. Using a unique animal model, in which we can separate the effects of the sex chromosomes (XY vs XX) from the hormonal differences between males and females (e.g., testosterone vs estrogen), we propose to investigate the mechanisms by which female T cells protect males from hypertension.

Failure of the grafted saphenous vein is due to the re-closure of the grafted vessel in the heart that can occur within months or the first few years. Although the outcome results after grafting internal mammary artery are far better, it cannot be used in patients with history of radiation, aortic coarctation and other vascular problems. Also, artery cannot be grafted in all branches of the coronary system in the heart. In this study, we proposed novel mechanisms by transducing a gene and preserving endothelium in the grafted vein to maintain patency of the vein graft and determine underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. The proposed studies will provide conceptual support of our hypothesis and position us to translate our investigation into a clinical study in patients wit coronary artery disease.","8153099; ","AGRAWAL, DEVENDRA K.;","LEE, ALBERT ","03/13/2015","02/28/2019","adverse outcome; Affect; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Animal Model; Animals; Anterior; Anti-inflammatory; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Aortic coarctation; Area; Arterial Fatty Streak; Arteries; ascending aorta; Atherosclerosis; Autologous; Blood Vessels; Bypass; Caliber; Cardiology; Cardiovascular system; CCL2 gene; cell growth; Cell Proliferation; Cell Therapy; Cellular biology; Cessation of life; Clinical; Clinical Research; Coronary; Coronary Angiography; Coronary Arteriosclerosis; Coronary artery; Coronary Artery Bypass; cytokine; Development; Disease; Echocardiography; Electrocardiogram; Endothelial Cells; Endothelium; Engineering; Epigastric; Epoprostenol; Event; Extracellular Matrix; Failure; Family suidae; Gene Delivery; Gene Expression; gene therapy; Genes; graft failure; Growth Factor; Heart; heart function; Heparin; high risk; Human; human disease; Hyperplasia; In Vitro; Inflammation; Inflammatory; injured; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I; intercellular communication; internal thoracic artery; intima media; Investigation; Laboratories; Left; Lipids; Mammary gland; Mediator of activation protein; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Mitogens; Modeling; Molecular; Molecular Biology; Monitor; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Myocardial Infarction; Natural regeneration; novel; Operative Surgical Procedures; Outcome; overexpression; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Patients; phase 1 study; Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases; Positioning Attribute; prevent; PTEN gene; public health relevance; Pump; Radiation; receptor expression; Recording of previous events; repaired; Research; Resolution; response to injury; restenosis; Saphenous Vein; shear stress; Side; Smooth Muscle Myocytes; stem cell therapy; Stenosis; System; Techniques; Tenascin; Testing; Therapeutic; Thick; Thrombosis; TIMP3 gene; tomography; Touch sensation; transgene expression; Transgenes; Translating; Treatment Efficacy; Ulcer; vector; Vein graft; Veins; Wit; Work; ","GENE AND STEM CELL THERAPY IN CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT","128063","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","03","498842","226973","725815",""

Neuroscientists do not yet fully understand just how the maturation of certain structures in the brain allows for the emergence of specific behaviors, such as learning, at specific ages. In addition, researchers know even less about how these developing neural systems are perturbed by early-life events that are known to cause developmental disorders, such as early-life immune activation or immune dysregulation. Importantly, males are twice as likely as females to be diagnosed with a number of developmental disorders and more specifically males have a higher prevalence of ADHD, autism, stuttering, and general learning disabilities than females. Thus, sex is a critical factor that must be considered when examining the etiology of developmental delays in learning. We hypothesize that sex differences in the developing immune system or microglia increases the vulnerability of males to early-life immune activation which subsequently results in immune dysregulation, the disruption of normal hippocampal development, and developmental delays in learning specifically in males. These hypotheses will be directly examined in the current proposal. Thus the proposed experiments will expand our understanding of the factors, both intrinsic (sex) and extrinsic (immune activation), that disrupt or delay the maturation of neural circuits important for learning.","8090639; ","SCHWARZ, JACLYN MARIE;","DESMOND, NANCY L","05/15/2016","02/28/2021","Adolescent; Adult; Affect; Age; Area; ARHGEF5 gene; Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; Autistic Disorder; Behavior; boys; Brain; brain behavior; Brain region; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Cell physiology; Cells; Child; Childhood; Data; design; Development; Developmental Delay Disorders; developmental disease/disorder; Diagnosis; Disease; Early Diagnosis; Environmental Risk Factor; Etiology; Event; Female; Fright; Future; girls; Goals; Health; High Prevalence; Hippocampus (Brain); Human; Immune; immune activation; immune function; Immune system; Infection; inhibitor/antagonist; Interleukin-1 beta; Intrinsic factor; Language; Learning; Learning Disabilities; learning outcome; Learning Skill; Life; male; Memory; Microglia; Minocycline; Molecular Target; Morphology; Motor Skills; Neonatal; neural circuit; Neurons; neurotrophic factor; Peripheral; Phenotype; postnatal; Rattus; relating to nervous system; Research; Research Personnel; research study; response; Risk Factors; sex; Sex Characteristics; Sex Functioning; social skills; Structure; Stuttering; Synaptic plasticity; System; Testing; theories; Therapeutic Intervention; Time; ","Impact of Neonatal Infection on the Development of Hippocampal-Dependent Learning","106553","NNRS","Neuroendocrinology, Neuroimmunology, Rhythms and Sleep Study Section ","","","02","225000","103320","328320",""

Indeed, many pathogens (e.g. HCMV, Rubella, HIV, Zika) are known to give rise to congenital birth defects, however, it is unclear whether the pathogen per se, or the resulting immune response is responsible for the damage (similar to fatalities resulting from influenza infection, or septic shock syndrome, where overwhelming immune responses are the actual cause of death).

In this project we use a novel nanoparticle-based method to detect blood levels of two TB and one host-response protein released during active TB disease in order to diagnose and monitor pediatric TB using easy-to-obtain small-volume blood samples. Based on our preliminary results, we are confident that this strategy has great potential to: 1) promote early detection of active pediatric TB to decrease progression and improve outcomes, and 2) permit rapid monitoring of pediatric TB therapy, which may allow physicians to personalize a child's treatment to avoid unnecessary exposure to toxic TB drugs once the child has cleared their TB infection.","10898749; ","HU, YE ;","REN, ZHAOXIA ","03/17/2017","02/28/2022","Address; Adult; Adverse effects; Antibodies; Antigens; Antitubercular Agents; Area; Bacillus (bacterium); Bacteria; Bacteriology; base; biobank; Biological Assay; Biological Markers; Blood; Blood specimen; Chest; Child; Childhood; Clinical; clinical Diagnosis; clinically relevant; co-infection; cohort; Custom; CXCL10 gene; Data; Detection; Diagnosis; Diagnostic; Diagnostic Procedure; Diagnostic Sensitivity; Diagnostic Specificity; Disease; Disease Progression; DNA; Drug resistance in tuberculosis; Early Diagnosis; Enrollment; Evaluation; Exposure to; extensive drug resistance; Growth; Health; high risk; HIV; Hour; Immune response; improved; improved outcome; Infection; interest; Investigation; Life; Longitudinal Studies; Mass Spectrum Analysis; Measures; Methods; Microscopy; miniaturize; Modeling; Molecular Weight; Monitor; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; mycobacterial; Mycobacterium Infections; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; nanoparticle; nanoshell; Noise; non-tuberculosis mycobacteria; novel; Organism; Patients; Pattern; pediatric patients; Peptide Signal Sequences; Peptides; Performance; Physicians; Population; predict clinical outcome; profiles in patients; prospective; Proteins; proteomic signature; Proteomics; Publishing; Recruitment Activity; Regimen; Research Infrastructure; Resources; response; sample collection; Sampling; Sensitivity and Specificity; Serum; Severities; Severity of illness; Signal Transduction; South Africa; Specificity; System; Techniques; Technology; Time; titanium dioxide; treatment duration; Treatment Efficacy; Treatment outcome; Treatment Protocols; treatment response; Trypsin; Tuberculosis; tuberculosis drugs; tuberculosis treatment; Validation; Work; ","Direct quantitation of the circulating Mtb-peptidome for pediatric TB management","090927","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","01","379343","148543","527886",""

The proposed studies will demonstrate the role of a key and potent viral modulator of cellular factors of the RNA helicase superfamily that mediate expanded cellular tropism, particularly in human cells, how modulation of multiple signaling pathways benefit the virus replication and expand the cellular tropism of the virus and their potential oncolysis of cancer cells. The model virus proposed here is Myxoma virus (MYXV), which infects only rabbits in nature, and has significant potential for the treatment of multiple human cancers.

Following the successful completion of the R21 phase the sensor will be deployed in an epidemiologic study to characterize the personal exposure of adolescents to UFP during activities of daily living and study the impact of UFP on respiratory health.

A significant barrier to successful treatment of metastatic disease involves the acquisition of dormant and chemoresistant phenotypes by disseminated tumor cells upon arrival to their metastatic niche. These cells are capable of reactivating proliferative programs to establish deadly metastatic recurrences years to decades after the initial implementation of therapy, making them one of the most clinically relevant targets in all of oncology. This study seeks to define the pathways critical to manipulating metastatic dormancy of BC cells, focusing specifically on the effect a novel lncRNA elicits on the epigenetic landscape of disseminated tumor cells.

NARRATIVE Since 2009, 24 states have mandated women be notified if they have dense breasts at the time of their screening mammogram and are encouraged to obtain supplemental screening. Supplemental breast cancer screening tests such as ultrasound may improve early detection of breast cancer for these women; however, they may also increase the chance that a woman without breast cancer will undergo additional diagnostic testing and unnecessary biopsies due to false positive findings. Using rigorous analytic methods, our study will use two large national databases to examine the impact of this state-specific legislation on the supplemental screening use and breast cancer detection rates in the United States and serve to guide future density notification policies, both in the remaining 26 states and at the federal level.","6100341; ","STOUT, NATASHA KAY;","WARREN, JOAN ","03/15/2017","02/28/2021","Address; Adoption; Affect; Age; aged; Awareness; base; Biopsy; Breast; Breast Cancer Detection; Breast Cancer Early Detection; breast density; breast imaging; Cancer Detection; cancer imaging; cancer risk; Cessation of life; Characteristics; Clinical; clinically significant; cohort; Communities; cost; Data; Data Analyses; Data Set; Data Sources; Databases; density; design; Detection; Diagnostic; Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging; Diagnostic Procedure; Diagnostic tests; Digital Mammography; Disclosure; economic outcome; Ethnic Origin; Evaluation; experience; Financial cost; Funding; Future; Health Benefit; Health Policy; Health Services Research; Image; imaging modality; Imaging technology; improved; improved outcome; Incidence; Insurance Coverage; Interdisciplinary Study; Investments; Knowledge; Laws; Lead; Life; Link; Lobbying; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; malignant breast neoplasm; Malignant Neoplasms; Mammography; Methods; Modeling; Movement; multidisciplinary; Natural experiment; neoplasm registry; Notification; Outcome; Patient advocacy; Patients; Pattern; Performance; Policies; Population; Quasi-experiment; Race; racial disparity; Radiology Specialty; Records; Reporting; Research; Research Design; Research Infrastructure; Resources; Risk; screening; Screening procedure; Series; Services; socioeconomic disparity; Specificity; Staging; Statutes and Laws; Subgroup; Testing; Time; trend; tumor; Ultrasonography; United States; Validation; Woman; ","Advanced Breast Imaging: Trends and Outcomes Associated with Recent Breast Density Reporting Legislation","207373","HSOD","Health Services Organization and Delivery Study Section ","","A1","01","379923","224801","604724",""

Here we will identify how OPCs migrate into remyelinating lesions using blood vessels as a physical scaffold, demonstrate that this can become dysregulated in human white matter injury, and that failure of OPCs to properly detach from vasculature is a mechanism preventing OPC recruitment into lesions, a mechanism for their blocked differentiation, and also may interfere with astrocyte-vascular coupling and integrity of the blood brain barrier contributing further to pathology.

Thus the ability to detect and monitor MBC is important in the management of BC. Provision of safe, inexpensive, non-invasive, specific and sensitive tests for monitoring of disease is key in disease management. The PI has characterized a biomarker called GP88. Biological and clinical studies have established the importance of GP88 in BC aggressiveness and as a predictive marker for recurrence. Published studies demonstrated GP88 is present in BC tissue but not in corresponding ?normal? breast tissue, elevated levels of GP88 in BC tumor tissue are associated with poor outcome and compared to healthy individuals, elevated GP88 blood levels can be found in BC patients with progressive disease. Thus using blood tests to detect and quantify GP88 during treatment could provide an ideal target for monitoring disease progression in BC patients undergoing therapy. This SBIR Phase I study will measure GP88 levels in sequential blood samples collected from ~140 MBC patients enrolled in an IRB approved study and correlate such levels with objective measures of clinical outcome. This application will explore this relationship and determine the best cutoff level for GP88 when examining sequential data in comparison to disease status. If we can establish a relationship between the GP88 level in blood and the disease state the information will be useful for disease management of MBC patients.","8058838; ","SERRERO, GINETTE ;","WEBER, PATRICIA A","03/15/2017","03/14/2018","Address; Biological; Biological Assay; Biological Markers; Biological Process; Blood; Blood Circulation; Blood specimen; Blood Tests; Breast; Breast Cancer Patient; Caring; Case Study; Cessation of life; circulating biomarkers; Clinical; Clinical Management; Clinical Research; Comprehensive Cancer Center; cost effective; Current Procedural Terminology Codes; Data; Diagnosis; Disease; Disease Management; Disease Progression; Drug resistance; Early Diagnosis; Enrollment; Ensure; Equilibrium; Evaluation; Feasibility Studies; Goals; Gold; Graph; Hematological Disease; Image; Imaging technology; Immunoassay; improved; Individual; Institutional Review Boards; Left; Logistic Regressions; Longitudinal Studies; malignant breast neoplasm; Mammary Gland Parenchyma; Mammary Neoplasms; Maryland; Measurement; Measures; Metastatic breast cancer; Monitor; Monitoring for Recurrence; Multivariate Analysis; Neoplasm Metastasis; No Evidence of Disease; Oncologist; Outcome; Patient Care; patient stratification; Patients; Performance; PGRN gene; Phase; phase 1 study; Play; predictive marker; Predictive Value; Progressive Disease; prospective; Protocols documentation; Publishing; Receiver Operating Characteristics; Recurrence; response; Risk; Role; Sampling; Sensitivity and Specificity; Serum; Small Business Innovation Research Grant; Stable Disease; Staging; standard of care; targeted biomarker; Techniques; Testing; Time; tissue biomarkers; Tissues; tumor; Tumor Tissue; tumorigenesis; Universities; Validation; Visit; Work; ","A Circulating Biomarker for use in Monitoring Metastatic Breast Cancer","210817","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","01","","","152589",""

JSU, however, has a significant number of URM students that are interested in such programs. JSU, however, realizes that a number of students that attend JSU come from traditionally underserved areas resulting in a lack of preparation for college. This deficiency often causes interested students to struggle with coursework, rigorous programs, and enriched training. This often concludes in higher turnover and a higher dropout rate. JSU has in the past three years focused on minimizing the detrimental impact a student's background has on his/her college development. The University has identified three areas that it believes every student at JSU must have in order to be successful at JSU. These three areas have been the focus of JSU programs, faculty, and staff to endure greater inclusion in general studies. We propose that each of these must also be included in a biomedical program to ensure intentional student development and combat major changes and dropouts due to academic struggles.","10383390; ","HILL, GLAKE ALTON;","CUBANO, LUIS ANGEL","05/01/2003","02/28/2021","academic program; Achievement; Address; apprenticeship; Area; base; Biology; Biomedical Research; biomedical scientist; career; Chemistry; college; College Preparation; combat; Communities; Country; Critical Thinking; demographics; design; Development; Discipline; Disease; Doctor's Degree; Dropout; Educational Curriculum; Ensure; Environment; Ethics; Faculty; Female; Fostering; Foundational Skills; Future; Goals; Health; improved; interest; Laboratory Research; Leadership; Learning; Life; Literature; mathematical ability; Measurable; Mentors; metacognition; Methods; Mission; novel; novel strategies; Performance; Population; Preparation; programs; Reading; Research; Research Personnel; Science; skills; social integration; student training; Students; success; tool; Training; Underrepresented Minority; underrepresented minority student; United States National Institutes of Health; Universities; Writing; ","Research Initiative for Scientific Enhancement Option II at Jackson State University","067122","TWD","Training and Workforce Development Subcommittee - D ","","","11","642868","44014","686882",""

Using methods of electrophysiology coupled with genetic manipulations that delete specific subunits from mice, this project will seek to gain new insights into molecular components that regulate Nav channel function through examination of a novel dual- pathway fast inactivation behavior observed in adrenal chromaffin cells, a useful model of neuronal excitability; in particular, the project will assess the role of intracellular fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (iFGFs) in producing the unusual inactivation behavior, and determine the role of iFGFs in regulating cell excitability.","1880394; ","LINGLE, CHRISTOPHER J;","SILBERBERG, SHAI D","03/15/2017","02/28/2021","Accounting; Action Potentials; Address; Adrenal Glands; Adrenal Medulla; Adult; Afferent Neurons; Animals; Axon; base; Behavior; Biochemical Genetics; Brain; Cells; Chromaffin Cells; Coupled; Dependence; design; Disease; disease-causing mutation; Electrophysiology (science); Embryo; Ensure; Excision; Fibroblast Growth Factor; fibroblast growth factor-14; Frequencies; Future; Generations; genetic manipulation; Genetic screening method; Heart; Height; insight; Investigation; Ion Channel; Lighting; Mediating; Methods; Modeling; Molecular; Mus; Muscle Fibers; Mutation; Myocardium; N-terminal; Neuroendocrine Cell; neuronal excitability; Neurons; novel; painful neuropathy; Pathway interactions; Play; Posterior Horn Cells; Property; Protein Isoforms; Protocols documentation; Recovery; Regulation; Reproducibility; response; Rodent; Role; Signal Transduction; Skeletal Muscle; Sorting - Cell Movement; Specificity; Squid; Stimulus; System; Testing; Therapeutic; Time; Training; Variant; voltage; Work; ","The role of FGF-mediated fast inactivation of Nav channels in cell excitability","100695","NTRC","Neurotransporters, Receptors, and Calcium Signaling Study Section ","","","01","218750","114844","333594",""

This proposal, to test a two promising new nerve cell-survival-promoting compounds (called LM22A-4 and LM22B-10) in models of brain trauma addresses this need directly. The proposed experiments will determine whether delayed-early treatment is effective, and whether treatment long after the injury will improve symptoms. In addition, they will provide insight into the question of whether the compound's main effects are due to improving cell survival, increasing regeneration or both and examine some of the mechanisms of these effects.

DS patients have an extra chromosome 21 containing the gene responsible for the production of the Amyloid beta precursor protein from which the amyloid beta proteins are formed. While in general this fact is thought to be responsible for presence of AD-like brain damage in these patients, the exact mechanisms are still unknown. Recent discoveries have shown that the amount of amyloid beta proteins produced is dependent on how efficient is the transport of its precursor inside the nerve cells. If the transport is slowed down more abeta is formed. We discovered that in DS the transport system is impaired and hypothesize that because of this the production of amyloid beta is elevated and ultimately responsible for the brain damage.

In addition, they will study how the impairment favors the formation of amyloid beta protein deposits, nerve cell damage and memory deficits.

We have identified histone demethylase JMJD1A as a novel target of vitamin D in colon cancer. We found that vitamin D induces microRNA miR-627, which suppresses JMJD1A. This proposal applies RNA nanotechnology to construct ultra-stable and non-toxic RNA nanoparticles harboring JMJD1A targeting siRNA and/or miR-627 for specific delivery to colon cancer.

There is a strong correlation between chronic drug use and increase susceptibility to HIV infection. Chronic drug users accounts for approximately a third of all cases of AIDS in the USA and the progression to AIDS dementia is markedly accelerated in opiate drug abusers. This proposal postulates that modulation of microbiota by opioid drug abuse and HIV1 infection may be a plausible mechanism for the persistent immune activation in these patients. Until now there are no published studies implicating microbiota in the dysregulated immune activation observed in HIV infected drug abusing population. These studies will allow for the delineation of the mechanisms and allow for the development of new therapeutic strategies to attenuate immune activation and reverse HIV disease progression both in HIV infected patients and in HIV infected drug abusing population.","8798717; 1938024 (contact); ","JOHNSON, TIMOTHY J; ROY, SABITA  (contact);","PUROHIT, VISHNUDUTT ","09/01/2014","08/31/2019","","Gut microbiota disruption by Morphine and in the context of HIV infection contributes to sustained immune activation","037843","NAED","NeuroAIDS and other End-Organ Diseases Study Section ","","","04","365889","195750","561639",""
