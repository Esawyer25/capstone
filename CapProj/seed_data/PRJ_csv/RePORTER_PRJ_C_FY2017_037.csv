SUMMARY Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by increases in plasma androgens and/or hirsutism, irregular menstrual periods, ovarian cystic morphology and infertility. The hypothesis that will be tested in this proposal is that in PCOS, increased plasma androgens via the androgen receptor causes an increase in food intake leading to increases in subcutaneous adipose tissue, insulin resistance, activation of adipose 17?-HSD, resulting in increased adipose androgen synthesis that further increases circulating androgen levels setting up a vicious cycle.  ","8773517; ","YANES, LICY L.;","","06/08/2017","05/31/2022","Adipose tissue; Affect; Age; Androgen Receptor; Androgens; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Animal Model; Animals; Attention; Blood Pressure; blood pressure regulation; Body Weight decreased; Cardiovascular Abnormalities; cardiovascular risk factor; Clinical; clinically relevant; Cyclization; Data; Development; Eating; Enalapril; Endocrine System Diseases; Ethnic Origin; Etiology; Exposure to; Female; fertility improvement; Hirsutism; Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases; Hyperandrogenism; Hypertension; imaging modality; implantation; improved; Infertility; Insulin Resistance; Lead; Life Style; Mediating; Menstruation; Metabolic; Mississippi; Modeling; molecular/cellular imaging; Morphology; Natriuresis; novel; Obesity; Ovarian; Patients; Perinatal; Physiological; Plasma; Play; Polycystic Ovary Syndrome; prenatal; pressure; Prevalence; Production; Rattus; Renin-Angiotensin System; reproductive; Research; Role; Stanolone; subcutaneous; Syndrome; Testing; theories; Therapeutic; tool; Woman; ","Role of 17?-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in the hypertension of PCOS","121334","ZGM1","Special Emphasis Panel ","6841","","01","200000","109583","","309583"

It is also present in other tissues, where its functions are not well understood. Calsequestrin's individual molecules appear to work much better when they cooperate to form a complex polymeric network. Mutations of the molecule lead to diseases of the heart, and perhaps skeletal muscles as well. We test here the idea that the disease brought about by the mutations largely stems from failure to form the network. The rules that govern calcium binding and network formation are best studied in solution, but the consequences of failure must be studied within cells. We, a lab that studies the physical chemistry of calsequestrin, and one specialized in demonstrating its properties within cells, have joined forces in a team configured specifically to define the mechanisms in solution and demonstrate them inside living cells. The study will include the diseased mutant protein, so that a picture will emerge of the causative changes in the molecular properties and the consequences of these changes in living individuals. The study of mutant molecules has two-way relevance, to understand the malfunctioning mechanisms and eventually remediate the disease, and also because the mutant molecules are ready-made constructs to test the functional relevance of different stretches within the molecular sequence?the so-called ?structure-function? relationship, a holy grail of basic science that eventually acquires relevance to public health. Finally, this project proposes the first systematic study of signals in human subjects with a naturally occurring modification of calsequestrin that is likely to alter the functions of skeletal muscle. Because disease consequences have not been demonstrated yet, the modification is dubbed a ?variant? rather than a ?mutation?. This last goal can then be simply put as: Is this variant a mutation?

Major advances have been made in the use of stem cell bioreactors for 'donor independent' platelet production, an approach that circumvents these issues. However a major roadblock in this approach has been the low platelet producing efficiency of the stem cells, which yield fetal-type megakaryocytes (platelet producing cells). Fetal type megakaryocytes multiply rapidly but do not enlarge, thus hampering platelet release. Our lab has identified the molecular basis for this defect, as well as approaches for switching megakaryocytes between fetal type and adult type, which multiply slowly but yield abundant platelets. The proposed project will exploit these findings to develop strategies that will optimiz bioreactor platelet production.","1964350; ","GOLDFARB, ADAM N.;","THOMAS, JOHN ","09/10/2015","05/31/2019","Acute Megakaryocytic Leukemias; Adult; Affect; Agonist; analog; Binding; Bioreactors; Blood Platelets; Bone Marrow; Cells; clinical application; clinical translation; Collection; Complex; cost effective; Critical Pathways; Custom; Data; Defect; Development; Dissection; Down Syndrome; Down-Regulation; Drug Targeting; Ectopic Expression; Engineering; Environment; Equilibrium; experimental study; fetal; Goals; Growth; H19 gene; Hemostatic function; HMGA2 gene; Human; human embryonic stem cell; Immunization; Immunodeficient Mouse; induced pluripotent stem cell; knock-down; Life; Megakaryocyte Proliferation; Megakaryocytes; Megakaryocytopoieses; Modeling; Molecular; Morphogenesis; Neonatal; neonatal human; novel; paralogous gene; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Patients; Perfusion; Pharmacology; Phenotype; Phosphotransferases; Platelet Count measurement; Platelet Transfusion; Pluripotent Stem Cells; Positive Transcriptional Elongation Factor B; Production; progenitor; programs; Protein Isoforms; public health relevance; Risk; scaffold; scale up; self-renewal; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Site; small hairpin RNA; Somatic Cell; Stem cells; System; Therapeutic; Thrombopoiesis; Transcriptional Activation; transmission process; Untranslated RNA; ","Controlling an Ontogenic Masterswitch to Maximize Thrombopoiesis","130550","ZHL1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","03","300000","145926","445926",""

This proposal will examine an enzyme critical in regulating inflammation in COPD, leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H), in the context of known genetic variations and the interaction of these variants with smoke in both cell-based models and in a well-genotyped, well-phenotyped population of 10,000 COPD subjects. The successful completion of the aim will provide important insights into the importance of genetic variation of the enzyme in the progression of COPD.

It is caused by brain damage. All persons with aphasia find listening and reading sentences challenging or impossible, depending on aphasia severity. The source of these sentence comprehension deficits is traditionally attributed to impairments of linguistic- specific processes involving letter reading, deriving word meaning or understanding grammar. Short-term memory and executive attention are routinely found to be impaired in persons with aphasia and may or may not be related to the comprehension impairments. Valid and efficient assessment and treatment of aphasia is dependent on knowledge of the dependencies among linguistic and other cognitive domains.

In the present studies, we will further develop systemic DNAzyme therapy for HD, by characterizing the extent and duration of its effectiveness using the rapidly progressing R6/2 mice expressing truncated mutant human huntingtin and the more slowly progressing BACHD mice expressing full-length mutant human huntingtin.","1969494; 1859657 (contact); ","POURMOTABBED, TAYEBEH ; REINER, ANTON J.

It is currently unknown how late in the disease process SMN inductive therapies can be beneficial in terms of either improving function or halting disease progression. This proposal focuses on 1) determining the latest time that SMN can be re-introduced after disease onset in milder forms of SMA, 2) where it is required, specifically if therapies that only increase SMN within the nervous system can correct all deficits and 3) we will compare the intrinsic electrical properties between control and age matched SMA motor neurons from intermediate and mild SMA mice throughout their life. This will allow us to correlate the physiological state of SMA motor neurons with disease progression. We believe that altered electrical properties are an early event in SMA motor neuron dysfunction. If the electrical properties are altered, identifying the timing, mechanisms and pathways involved could lead to pharmaceutical approaches that are SMN-independent and provide a complimentary approach that targets other pathways besides SMN. All of this research has important implications for therapy development.","8535341; ","DIDONATO, CHRISTINE J.;","NUCKOLLS, GLEN H.","09/30/2007","05/31/2018","Address; Adult; Adult Spinal Muscular Atrophy; Age; American; Antisense Oligonucleotides; Biology; Bypass; Cells; Cessation of life; Clinic; Clinical; Clinical Drug Development; Cyclization; Cystic Fibrosis; Development; Disease; Disease Progression; dosage; drug candidate; Due Process; Effectiveness; electrical property; Event; Exons; experimental study; Functional disorder; Funding; Genes; Genetic; Health; improved; improved functioning; In Vitro; Infant Mortality; insight; Intervention; Ion Channel; Lead; Life; Link; Measures; motor neuron function; Motor Neurons; mouse model; Mus; Mutation; Neoadjuvant Therapy; Neonatal; Nervous system structure; Neuraxis; Neuroglia; neuron loss; Neurons; Neurotransmitter Receptor; novel; Nucleotides; Onset of illness; Outcome; Paralysed; patch clamp; Pathogenesis; Pathologic; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pharmacologic Substance; Phase; Phenotype; Physiological; preclinical development; Preparation; Process; Property; Proteins; public health relevance; Research; response; RNA Splicing; Severities; Severity of illness; Site; Slice; SMN protein (spinal muscular atrophy); SMN1 gene; SMN2 gene; Spinal Cord; Spinal Muscular Atrophy; Stridors; success; survival motor neuron gene; Synapses; Testing; Therapeutic; therapy development; Time; Translating; treatment site; treatment strategy; Work; ","Spinal muscular atrophy: inducing SMN expression","060926","CDIN","Cell Death in Neurodegeneration Study Section ","","","09","224625","71328","295953",""

This is underscored by current statistics that indicates that 1 in 6 deaths in the US are due to coronary heart disease which in combination with the prevalence of peripheral artery disease (12-20% in individuals >60 years of age) make the cardiovascular diseases the most prominent health problem in the US. New therapeutic and diagnostic technologies including advancements in vascular tissue engineering technologies and materials for small vessel replacement, and development of imaging instrumentation supporting these areas are needed. Currently, the development of functional vascular tissue scaffolds/constructs and evaluation of these constructs properties are hampered by lack of non-destructive rapid assessment methods. Presently, such assessment is based on destructive analysis at multiple time points, which is expensive, time consuming and subject to inherent cellular variability. Moreover, post- implantation maturation, long-term safety and efficacy of the engineered constructs are difficult to assess in the clinical setting where implant removal for destructive analysis is not possible. I this grant application we propose the development and validation of a bi-modal tissue diagnostic platform that offers a non-destructive solution addressing the major challenges in development of a tissue engineered vascular scaffold and construct.","9368030; 6647839 (contact); ","GRIFFITHS, LEIGH GARETH; MARCU, LAURA  (contact);","LEE, ALBERT ","09/01/2015","05/31/2019","Address; Age-Years; Applications Grants; Area; Assessment tool; Atherosclerosis; attenuation; Biochemical; Biocompatible Materials; Blood Vessels; Bone Marrow; Cardiac Surgery procedures; Cardiovascular Diseases; Carotid Arteries; Cattle; Cessation of life; Chemicals; Clinical; clinical application; Computing Methodologies; Coronary heart disease; cost; Custom; Cytoskeleton; Data; Data Analyses; Defect; Development; Diagnostic; Engineering; Evaluation; Excision; Extracellular Matrix; Family suidae; Fluorescence; Fluorescence Spectroscopy; Frequencies; Health; Heterogeneity; Histologic; Image; Image Analysis; Imaging technology; Immunology procedure; Implant; implantation; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; Individual; insight; instrumentation; Label; Laboratories; Measurement; mechanical properties; Mechanics; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Methods; Microscopy; Modality; Modeling; Monitor; Morphology; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; Nonionizing Radiation; optical spectra; Optics; Patients; Pericardial sac structure; Peripheral arterial disease; Prevalence; Process; Production; Property; public health relevance; Quality of life; regenerative; Research; Rotation; Safety; Sampling; scaffold; Scanning; screening; Signal Transduction; Site; spectroscopic imaging; statistics; Structure; Structure-Activity Relationship; Surface; System; Techniques; Technology; Testing; Therapeutic; Time; Tissue Engineering; tissue support frame; Tissues; tool; Translations; Tubular formation; Ultrasonics; Ultrasonography; Validation; vascular tissue engineering; working group; ","Bimodal platform for nondestructive analysis of engineered vascular biomaterials","121068","MEDI","Medical Imaging Study Section ","","","03","250000","136510","386510",""

Patients with spinal metastases and their physicians face challenging decisions with daunting implications for survival, quality of life and cost. These patients wish to understand their prognosis in terms of quantity and quality of life and they, together with their physicians, hope to choose treatments that optimize outcomes in a manner consistent with the patient?s values. This decision making framework requires robust data on the range of outcomes pertinent to patients with spinal metastases and the capacity of specific treatments, including surgical and non-operative modalities, to influence these results. These crucial questions comprise the focus of the research and career development activities proposed here. The results of this investigation are anticipated to be of immediate use to patients with metastatic spinal disease, oncologists and surgeons and will potentially support the development of a multi-center study prospectively examining functional outcomes and quality of life for individuals with spinal metastatic disease.","14515603; ","SCHOENFELD, ANDREW ;","WASHABAUGH, CHARLES H.","06/09/2017","05/31/2022","Address; Aftercare; Age; Cancer Center; cancer diagnosis; career development; Characteristics; Clinical; Clinical Data; Cohort Studies; Collaborations; Comorbidity; cost; Cost Effectiveness Analysis; cost-effectiveness ratio; Data; Decision Analysis; Decision Making; Development; Diagnosis; Disease; Ensure; Environment; Epidemiologic Methods; experience; Face; Focus Groups; Fright; functional outcomes; General Hospitals; Goals; Health; Hospitals; incremental cost-effectiveness; independent ambulation; Individual; Inferior; Institution; Institutionalization; Intervention; Investigation; Journals; Learning; Life Expectancy; Literature; Malignant Neoplasms; Massachusetts; Medical; Medical Oncologist; medical specialties; Medicine; meetings; Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award; Mentors; Mentorship; Metastatic Neoplasm to the Spine; Methods; Michigan; mid-career faculty; mortality; Multicenter Studies; Musculoskeletal; Musculoskeletal Diseases; NCI Scholars Program; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neurological status; Neurosurgeon; Nutritional status; older patient; Oncologist; oncology; Operative Surgical Procedures; Orthopedic Surgery procedures; Orthopedics; Outcome; outcome forecast; Pain; palliation; Patient Care; patient oriented; Patient Preferences; Patients; Peer Review; Physicians; Play; prevent; Process; Productivity; Prospective Studies; Publishing; Qualitative Research; Quality of life; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Radiation Oncologist; Recruitment Activity; Registries; Research; Research Methodology; Research Training; Risk; Role; Scientist; skills; Spinal; Spinal Diseases; Spine surgery; Surgeon; Techniques; Testing; Time; Training; Treatment outcome; tumor; Tumor Burden; Universities; Vertebral column; Woman; Wood material; Work; ","Optimizing Surgical Interventions for Patients with Spinal Metastases: A Mixed-Methods Study","071464","AMS","Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases Special Grants Review Committee ","","","01","165000","12661","177661",""

Successful accomplishment of the proposed research will form the basis of a clinically translatable MR imaging technology not only for developing novel bacteria based cancer therapies, but also for improving the diagnosis and treatment monitoring of bacteria infection in general, both of which are highly relevant to the part of NIH's mission.","10392421; ","LIU, GUANSHU ;","LIU, GUOYING ","07/01/2016","04/30/2018","Address; Amides; Amination; Amines; Anaerobic Bacteria; Animal Model; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Bacteria; Bacterial Infections; Bifidobacterium; bioluminescence imaging; Bone Marrow; Brain; Brain Neoplasms; cancer therapy; Cell Survival; Cells; Cessation of life; Characteristics; Chemicals; Clinical; clinical application; clinical development; clinical practice; Clinical Trials; clinically translatable; Clostridium; Contrast Media; Data; Detection; Development; Diagnosis; Environment; Escherichia; Event; Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis; Experimental Neoplasms; Frequencies; Genetic; Germination; Glioma; Goals; Growth; Hour; human disease; Hydroxyl Radical; Hypoxia; imaging agent; imaging approach; imaging biomarker; imaging modality; Imaging technology; improved; Infection; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Injectable; Injection of therapeutic agent; innovation; interest; Investigation; Kinetics; Knowledge; Label; Lesion; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Measures; Medical; metallicity; Methods; Mission; Modeling; molecular imaging; Monitor; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; neoplastic cell; non-invasive imaging; novel; novel therapeutics; Organ; pathogen; pathogenic bacteria; Pathology; Phase I Clinical Trials; Physiologic pulse; pre-clinical; predictive marker; Protocols documentation; Protons; Public Health; Radioactive; Reporting; Reproduction spores; Research; Resolution; Salmonella; Signal Transduction; Solid Neoplasm; Specificity; success; Techniques; Technology; Technology Transfer; temporal measurement; Testing; Therapeutic; Time; Treatment Efficacy; tumor; tumor eradication; United States National Institutes of Health; Water; ","Optimization of CEST MRI for detection of bacteria","021573","BMIT","Biomedical Imaging Technology Study Section ","","","02","50000","30800","80800",""

Excess bone loss leads to risks of debilitating fractures. An estimated 44 million Americans are at risk of osteoporosis. Within the U.S., 10 million people are estimated to already have this disease and an additional 34 million are suspected of having low bone mass and at risk of developing the disease. There are 1.5 million osteoporotic fractures in the U.S. each year and the cost of caring for these fractures is estimated at $12 billion to $18 billion. Indirect costs in lost productivity of patiens and care givers add billions to this cost. Thus, therapies that target bone resorbing osteoclasts while preserving bone formation have the potential to have a significant impact on patients.","3131924 (contact); 1870628; ","OURSLER, MERRY JO (contact); WESTENDORF, JENNIFER J;","ALEKEL, D.

There are no FDA-approved medications for cocaine addiction. The goal of this project is to examine the genomes of nerve cells in brains of cocaine addicted persons who died of cocaine overdose, to determine whether there are mutations in genes which might make certain nerve cells function improperly, giving rise to risk for cocaine addiction. Identification of such mutatins would create new targets for medication development and would improve our understanding of the origins of cocaine addiction.","2415714; ","BERRETTINI, WADE H;","LOSSIE, AMY N","09/15/2016","05/31/2021","Adult; Age; Alleles; Anterior; Antibodies; Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies; Biological Assay; Brain; Brain Diseases; Brain region; Brodmann's area; Cell Line; Cell Nucleus; Cell physiology; Cell Separation; Chromatin; Chronic; Cocaine; Cocaine Dependences; cocaine overdose; cocaine use; CRISPR/Cas technology; Data; Daughter; Detection; Development; digital; DNA; Dopamine; Drug abuse; drug development; drug of abuse; Drug Targeting; Drug usage; Elements; Embryonic Development; endonuclease; Event; FDA approved; Fluorescence; Gene Frequency; Genes; Genetic Research; Genetic Transcription; Genome; genome wide association study; Genomic Segment; Glutamates; Goals; Health; Heritability; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Human; Human Genome; improved; Individual; Inherited; IS Elements; Label; Length; Medial; Mediating; Mendelian disorder; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Mutation; neuron development; Neuronal Differentiation; Neurons; novel; Nuclear; Nucleus Accumbens; Paste substance; Pathway Analysis; Pathway interactions; Patients; peer; Peripheral; permissiveness; Persons; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacotherapy; Phosphorylation; Phosphotransferases; Polynucleotide 5'-Hydroxyl-Kinase; Population; precursor cell; Prefrontal Cortex; promoter; Psychotherapy; Public Health; public health relevance; Published Comment; reference genome; Reporting; response; Retrotransposition; Retrotransposon; reuptake; Rewards; Risk; Risk Factors; RNA; RNA Polymerase II; RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase; Sampling; sex; Somatic Mutation; Support Groups; Surveys; Synapses; Technology; Testing; Tissues; transposon/insertion element; Twin Studies; United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration; Variant; Ventral Tegmental Area; ","Mobile DNA in Drug Abuse","040972","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","283713","146844","430557",""

Biomedical and clinician scientists are of fundamental importance for biomedical research, as they form a bridge between clinicians and medical scientists, are the most qualified to ask the proper scientific health related questions, and have been referred to as the gateway into health of ideas from scientists at large. This concern is based on documented facts such as the progressive decline in the percentage of NIH awarded research project grants going to MD's or MD/PhD's, the progressive decline in the actual number of first-time MD applicants for NIH research project grants, and the progressive decline in the total number of MD post- doctoral trainees supported by NIH. One of the causes for these declining numbers has been the inability of clinical departments to keep pace with the rate and complexity of scientific progress. Consequently, a priority of this training program is to ensure that its trainees acquire an in-depth education and expertise that combines the study of renal physiology or pathophysiology and the development of skills in one or more areas of basic or applied sciences.","1885395; ","LIESKE, JOHN C;","RYS-SIKORA, KRYSTYNA E","07/01/1975","04/30/2019","Kidney Diseases; Research Training; Training Programs; ","Kidney Disease Research Training Program","007013","ZDK1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","39","175554","14044","180607",""

NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE:  The cerebral cortex, where high-level cognition, motor and sensory processing, and integrative behavior occurs, contains thousands of distinct types of specialized nerve cells (neurons) enabling it to perform such complex tasks; corticofugal projection neurons (CFuPN) are the class of ?output? neurons connecting the cerebral cortex to the spinal cord and other brain structures, playing key roles in human motor, sensory, and cognitive function and disease. Degeneration or abnormal development or function of CFuPN causes human diseases, including ALS and other motor neuron diseases, spinal cord injury, Huntington's disease, corticobasal degeneration, cerebral palsy, some intellectual disability syndromes, some autism spectrum disorders, some pain syndromes, and some epilepsies. Building on recent work identifying several important CFuPN control molecules, this project will pursue deep and rigorous functional investigation of central molecular controls and regulatory mechanisms critical for development, connectivity, circuit formation, and function of CFuPN, and this work has potential future relevance for directed differentiation of stem cells or progenitors for regeneration or drug development, or interconversion / ?reprogramming? of CFuPN to make clinically useful neuron types from other ?surplus? neurons in the brain; these investigations will 1) identify critical regulatory mechanisms in CFuPN development (in mice); 2) apply innovative genetic technologies for study of CFuPN differentiation, circuit formation, and future regeneration; 3) discover the potential for manipulation of these mechanisms for neuron subtype ?reprogramming? for nervous system manipulation and potential future repair/treatment, and enabling directed differentiation of stem cells into specific neuron subtypes, for modeling diseases and discovering new drugs.","6725967; ","MACKLIS, JEFFREY D;","LAVAUTE, TIMOTHY M","08/01/2002","05/31/2021","Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; autism spectrum disorder; Axon; Behavior; Behavioral; Biology; Brain; Cerebral cortex; Cerebral Palsy; Clinical; clinically relevant; Cognition; Cognitive; cognitive function; comparative; Complex; Confusion; Corpus striatum structure; corticobasal degeneration; Development; Disease; Disease model; drug development; epigenetic regulation; Epilepsy; Equilibrium; experimental study; Foundations; Future; Gene Expression Profiling; genetic technology; Genetic Transcription; Goals; Human; human disease; Huntington Disease; Hybrids; In Vitro; in vivo; Individual; induced pluripotent stem cell; innovation; insight; Intellectual functioning disability; Interneurons; Investigation; lens; loss of function; M cell; Maintenance; Molecular; Motor; Motor Neuron Disease; Motor Neurons; Multipotent Stem Cells; Mus; Natural regeneration; neocortical; Nervous system structure; Neurodegenerative Disorders; neurogenesis; neuron development; Neuronal Injury; Neurons; novel; novel therapeutics; Output; Pain; Pathway interactions; Pilot Projects; Play; Pluripotent Stem Cells; Population; postnatal; progenitor; programs; protein complex; Regulation; repaired; Research; Role; screening; Sensory; Sensory Process; Specificity; Spinal; Spinal Cord; Spinal cord injury; stem cell differentiation; Stem cells; Structure; Syndrome; System; Tertiary Protein Structure; Therapeutic; Time; Transcriptional Regulation; Work; ","Molecular Controls over Neurogenesis, Subtype Development, and Diversity of Cortical Output Projection Neurons","045523","NCF","Neurogenesis and Cell Fate Study Section ","","","13","218750","147194","365944",""

The proximal tubule (PT) cells of the kidney secrete most of this H+ into the fluid that is eventually excreted as urine. This process, which helps maintain the acid-base status of the body, increases under conditions of acidosis. However, PT cells do not sense H+ per se, but the ratio of CO2/HCO3? (the components of soda water) in the blood. Indeed, this ratio rises during acidosis. Preliminary work suggests that a protein known as receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase ? (RPTP?), which weaves through the cell membrane of PT cells that faces the blood, is the CO2/HCO3? sensor. Part of RPTP? is on the outside of the PT cell, facing the blood. Interestingly, this part of RPTP? has a region that resembles the well-studied enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA). This is the CA-like domain (CALD). However, it appears that mutations that have occurred during evolution have destroyed RPTP??s enzymatic activity. Another part of RPTP?, on the inside of the PT cell, can remove phosphate groups from target proteins. This activity is important for sending signals among molecules within the PT cell. The goals of this project are: (1) To identify how the binding of CO2 and HCO3? to the CALD of RPTP? control RPTP??s ability to remove phosphate groups on target proteins. (2) To understand how RPTP? and its target proteins control the secretion of H+ by the living proximal tubules. And (3) to understand how RPTP?, and the proteins that it sends signals to, control the pH of the blood in living animals during acidosis. The proposed work could have important implications for clinical approaches to acidosis, which is common in a wide range of diseases; hypertension, schizophrenia, and cancer.","9227544; ","BORON, WALTER F;","KETCHUM, CHRISTIAN J.","06/10/2017","04/30/2021","Acidosis; Acids; Address; Adenoviruses; Animals; Apical; apical membrane; Astrocytes; base; Bicarbonates; Binding; Blood; Blood gas; body system; Carbon Dioxide; carbonate dehydratase; Carbonic Anhydrase II; Cell membrane; cell type; Cells; Chemistry; Chronic; Clinical; Data; dimer; Dimerization; Disease; Elements; Employee Strikes; Enzymes; Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor; ERBB2 gene; Evolution; exhibitions; Exhibits; extracellular; Face; Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer; Functional disorder; Genetic Transcription; Goals; Hypertension; inhibitor/antagonist; Injectable; inorganic phosphate; insight; interdisciplinary approach; Kidney; kidney cell; Knock-out; Knockout Mice; Lead; Ligand Binding Domain; Link; Liquid substance; Malignant Neoplasms; Measures; Membrane; Metabolic; Metabolic acidosis; Metabolism; Molecular; Monitor; Mus; mutant; Mutation; Organ; Orphan; Patients; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases; Physicians; Play; Pongidae; prevent; Process; protein profiling; Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase; Proteins; Proximal Kidney Tubules; receptor; Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases; Recombinant Proteins; Regulation; respiratory; Respiratory Acidosis; response; Role; Sampling; Schizophrenia; sensor; Shock; Side; Signal Transduction; soft drink; Stream; Testing; Translating; Urine; Viral; virtual; Water; Wild Type Mouse; Work; ","Role of RPTP-gamma in sensing and transducing acid-base disturbances in the renal proximal tubule","113197","KMBD","Kidney Molecular Biology and Genitourinary Organ Development ","","","01","318909","177897","496806",""

In many children the tics will disappear before they've lasted as long as a year, but in others they go on to become Tourette syndrome or Chronic Tic Disorder (TS/CTD). Prior research generally has not clarified whether abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS/CTD are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. This project will study children with recent-onset tics using clinical evaluation, MRI, and neuropsychological measures, and repeat these measures at the earliest time point that TS/CTD can be diagnosed. The results from the first assessment will be compared to results from two matching comparison groups: children with no personal or family history of tics, and children who have had tics for more than a year (Existing TS/CTD). This new approach may provide a new angle on research into Tourette syndrome, in addition to providing sorely needed information about prognosis for children who just started ticcing.","1882590 (contact); 1930414; ","BLACK, KEVIN J (contact); SCHLAGGAR, BRADLEY L;","ZEHR, JULIA L","06/09/2017","05/31/2022","Advertisements; Age; Anniversary; Appearance; Attention; Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; Biological Markers; Brain; brain abnormalities; Brain imaging; Budgets; caudate nucleus; Child; Childhood; Chronic; Clinical; Clinical Data; comparison group; critical period; Data; Data Set; Development; dexterity; Diagnosis; Disease; Disease remission; Enrollment; Epidemiology; Etiology; Evaluation; Family history of; follow-up; Follow-Up Studies; Functional disorder; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Gilles de la Tourette syndrome; habit learning; high risk; Image; improved; inattention; interest; Investigation; Laboratories; Learning; learning strategy; Life; Machine Learning; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Measures; medical attention; Methods; motor learning; Movement; neuropsychological; Neuropsychology; Noise; novel; novel strategies; Outcome; outcome forecast; outcome prediction; Patients; Perfusion; Phase; phenomenological models; Physiology; Population; Preparation; Prevention; Process; prospective; Prospective Studies; Psychiatric Diagnosis; Public Health; public health relevance; Publishing; Quality Control; Recruitment Activity; Research; research clinical testing; Research Design; Rest; Retrospective Studies; Sampling; secondary analysis; Severities; Standardization; Structure; Symptoms; Syndrome; Testing; Tic disorder; Time; vector; ","The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders","104030","CPDD","Child Psychopathology and Developmental Disabilities Study Section ","","A1","01","512254","209384","721638",""

However, systemic toxicity from these drugs can significantly impact patient's quality of life and overall survival. To address these limitations of chemotherapy, we propose a transformative technology where the chemotherapy drug is intra-arterially infused from a drug-eluting stent (DES) and captured along the venous outflow of the tumor using an intravascular drug-capturing device (DCD). First we will develop the DES (Aim 1), then develop the DCD (Aim 2) and finally test the drug release and capture concept in rat and rabbit animal models (Aim 3). Successful development of such a system will represent a paradigm shift in the oncology community by improving patient's quality of life, potentially prolonging survival, resurrecting failed Phase I trials from drug toxicity, increasing the use of FDA- approved previously toxic drugs, and opening up new clinical trials to test much higher doses. The proposed idea of drug release and capture represents a platform technology and may have unparalleled impact in other diseases. For example, the system can be designed to isolate exposure to thrombolytic therapy or immunosuppressants.","8527169; 10243591 (contact); ","KHADEMHOSSEINI, ALI ; OKLU, RAHMI  (contact);","RAMPULLA, DAVID ","06/06/2017","03/31/2021","Address; Adverse effects; Angiography; Animal Model; Anthracyclines; Antibiotics; Antineoplastic Agents; Area; Arteries; Binding; Biocompatible Materials; Biomedical Engineering; Blood Circulation; bronchial artery; Bypass; Cancer Model; Cancer Patient; Catheters; Chemistry; chemotherapy; Clinical Trials; Community Clinical Oncology Program; cost; Dangerousness; Data; design; Detection; Development; Devices; Dialysis procedure; Disease; DNA; Dose; Doxorubicin; drug testing; Drug toxicity; Drug usage; Drug Utilization; Ensure; Evaluation; Excision; experience; Exposure to; FDA approved; femoral artery; Hematologic Agents; Hemofiltration; Hepatic artery; Iliac Vein; Image; Immunosuppressive Agents; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; Inferior vena cava structure; Infusion procedures; innovation; Interleukin-2; Intravenous; Liver; malignant breast neoplasm; Malignant neoplasm of liver; Malignant neoplasm of lung; Malignant Neoplasms; Mammary gland; Microspheres; minimally invasive; Modeling; Monitor; novel strategies; oncology; Oryctolagus cuniculus; Patient-Focused Outcomes; Patients; Pelvis; Performance; Perfusion; Pharmaceutical Preparations; phase I trial; Platinum; prevent; Prevention; Procedures; Property; prototype; Pulmonary veins; Quality of life; Rattus; Risk; Site; Stents; Stream; Surface; System; systemic toxicity; Technology; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Embolization; Thrombolytic Therapy; Time; Topoisomerase Inhibitors; Toxic effect; Treatment Efficacy; Treatment Protocols; tumor; Validation; Vascular blood supply; Veins; Venous; ","Targeted chemotherapy delivery and capture","024403","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","448920","103950","552870",""

Although traditionally classified as separate entities, these diverse disorders share common psychotic symptoms, as well as similar cognitive deficits, disease courses and genetic determinants. However, the underlying reasons (e.g., abnormalities in brain circuitry, genetic make-up, etc.) why PSD patients tend to exhibit similar phenomenological behaviors (e.g., positive symptoms in conjunction with poor cognitive control) have yet to be elucidated. The current proposal will utilize novel analytic methods and neuroimaging techniques to classify PSD patients into meaningful sub-groups based on objective pathology within frontal brain circuits. We will also examine whether behavioral deficits and brain abnormalities are dependent on genetic factors. At the end of this proposal, we will produce a rich, publically available dataset that can be used to increase our collective understanding of these devastating diseases.","8698443; ","MAYER, ANDREW ROBERT;","MORRIS, SARAH E","05/02/2014","03/31/2018","Algorithms; analytical method; axonal guidance; Behavior; Behavioral; Biological Assay; Biological Markers; Bipolar Disorder; Brain; brain abnormalities; brain circuitry; Categories; caudate nucleus; Classification; Clinical; Clinical Trials; Cognition; cognitive control; Cognitive deficits; Copy Number Polymorphism; Corpus striatum structure; cost; Data; Data Set; Delusional disorder; Development; Diagnosis; Diagnostic; diagnostic accuracy; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; disability; Disease; disease classification; DNA copy number; DNA Sequence Alteration; Dopamine; Dorsal; DSM-V; executive function; exhibitions; Exhibits; experience; Future; gamma-Aminobutyric Acid; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Determinism; genetic makeup; Genetic Markers; Genetic Risk; genetic risk factor; Glutamates; Goals; Gray unit of radiation dose; Hallucinations; Healthcare; hemodynamics; Impaired cognition; Impairment; improved; indexing; Individual; Investigation; Lateral; Link; Long-Term Potentiation; Measures; Medial; Mediating; Mental disorders; Mental Health; Methodology; Methods; Modality; Modeling; multimodality; multisensory; Mutation; National Institute of Mental Health; Neurobiology; neuroimaging; Neurons; neurophysiology; Neurotransmitters; novel; novel strategies; Occupational; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pattern; Phenotype; Population; Prefrontal Cortex; primary outcome; Psychopathology; Psychotic Disorders; psychotic symptoms; Public Health; public health relevance; Recording of previous events; Recruitment Activity; Refractory; Research Domain Criteria; Role; S-Adenosylmethionine; Schizoaffective Disorders; Schizophrenia; Schizophreniform Disorder; secondary outcome; self reported behavior; Sensory; Signal Pathway; Single Nucleotide Polymorphism; Structural defect; success; Symptoms; Synapses; System; Techniques; Thinking; Treatment Protocols; white matter; ","A Multidimensional Investigation of Cognitive Control Deficits in Psychopathology","101512","ZMH1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","04","368457","226396","594853",""

Cole, and Jennifer Wambach (St. Louis Children's Hospital, Washington University) Overview: Mutations in ABCA3, an AT2 cell selective lipid transporter, cause lethal acute and chronic interstitial lung diseases in infants and children. Defects in ABCA3 cause surfactant deficiency and AT2 cell injury resulting in respiratory distress and interstitial lung disease. Our Consortium will develop novel strategies to model and correct ABCA3 deficiency in alveolar progenitor cells, seeking to permanently correct the surfactant deficiency and accompanying lung injury caused by ABCA3 mutations. A unique subset of Axin2+ AT2 progenitor cells will be identified for gene correction; patient specific IPSCs will be produced, differentiated into alveolar progenitors, phenotyped, and used for study of gene editing. A milestone-driven program, will utilize patient-specific IPSC cells, isolated AT2 cells from patients with ABCA3 deficiency, and conditional Abca3flox/flox mice to model the disease and develop corrective strategies in vitro and in vivo. Effects of ABCA3 mutations on the routing, processing, stability, and function of the ABCA3 protein, surfactant proteins, and lipid homeostasis will be modeled in human IPSCs and AT2 progenitor cells. ABCA3 sufficient and patient-specific IPSCs will be differentiated in vitro to produce AT2 cells that will be used for phenotyping and optimization of gene editing via CRISPR/CAS. AT2 progenitor cells will be characterized and provided to the research community for future use in pharmacological approaches to treat the disease. The biological effects of ABCA3 dysfunction and correction will be identified in human cells in vitro. Transgenic mice in which the murine Abca3 gene has been conditionally deleted in AT2 cells will be used in concert with mice expressing Cas9 to test delivery of guide RNAs and AT2 cells via viral and direct mRNA delivery in vivo. We will identify and selectively target unique Wnt responsive Axin2+ (AEPs) AT2 progenitor cells to test strategies to correct ABCA3 in vitro and in vivo by gene editing. We will develop efficient strategies for in vivo gene editing to AT2 cell progenitor cells, with the long term goal of using CRISPR/CAS9 our new Cas9 variants to correct human ABCA3 alleles in vivo. Viral and direct RNA delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 and guide RNA to AT2 progenitor cells will be optimized, and the biological effects of gene correction determined in vivo and in vitro. Our PCTC consortium will develop precise milestones needed to move the project from in vitro and in vivo studies in the mouse towards clinical studies in which we will seek to correct ABCA3 mutations in the clinic for prevention or amelioration of ABCA3-related lung disease. Development of gene editing strategies for ABCA3 deficiency serves as a prototype to assess feasibility of gene editing in lung progenitor cells that will be broadly applicable for treatment of genetic diseases affecting the alveolar epithelium.","6406539; 1865475; 1873296 (contact); ","KOTTON, DARRELL N.; MORRISEY, EDWARD E; WHITSETT, JEFFREY A (contact);","LIN, SARA ","09/23/2016","05/31/2023","ABCA3 gene; Acute; Adult; Affect; AGTR2 gene; Air Pollution; airway epithelium; Alleles; Alveolar; Alveolar Cell; alveolar epithelium; Amniotic Fluid; Biological; Birth; Boston; cell injury; Cell physiology; Cell Survival; Cells; Cellular biology; Child; Childhood; Chronic; Chronic lung disease; Clinic; Clinical; Clinical Research; Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats; Collaborations; Communities; Complex; CRISPR/Cas technology; Data; Defect; design; Development; Disease; Disease model; disease-causing mutation; DNA; Doctor of Medicine; effective therapy; Environmental Risk Factor; Epithelial; Epithelial Cells; Face; Failure; Functional disorder; Future; gene correction; Gene Targeting; Generations; Genes; Genetic; genetic disorder diagnosis; Goals; Guide RNA; Hereditary Disease; Homeostasis; Human; human tissue; In Vitro; in vivo; Inborn Genetic Diseases; Individual; induced pluripotent stem cell; infancy; Infant; Inflammation; Interstitial Lung Diseases; Laboratories; Lead; Lipids; Liposomes; Lung; Lung diseases; lung injury; Mediating; member; Mendelian disorder; Messenger RNA; Modeling; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; mouse model; Mus; Mutation; nanoparticle; Natural regeneration; Neonatal; neonate; novel strategies; Other Genetics; Pathogenesis; Pathologic; Patients; Pediatric Hospitals; Peripheral; Pharmacology; Phenotype; Prevention; Process; Production; progenitor; programs; Proteins; prototype; Pulmonary Fibrosis; Pulmonary Surfactants; Reagent; reagent testing; repaired; Research; respiratory; Respiratory distress; Respiratory Failure; RNA; Role; Route; self-renewal; sharing data; skills; Smoking; Stem cells; Structure; success; Surface; surfactant; surfactant deficiency; System; TACSTD1 gene; Technology; Telomerase; Testing; trafficking; Transgenic Mice; Universities; Variant; Vascular remodeling; vector; Viral; Washington; Work; ","Editing Alveolar Progenitor Cells for Correction of Monogenic Disease","134745","ZHL1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","868988","116297","985285",""

Currently, available treatments for this condition are aimed only at the symptoms and complications (e.g. dehydration) and not at modifying the disease process.

This Core will also administer the Pipeline Grant program that will provide funds for other junior investigators to obtain preliminary data to submit an extramural grant. The Education portion of this Core will provide both education in various aspects of research and provide a process of formative and summative evaluations of the junior investigators in the program.","1936058; ","RECKELHOFF, JANE F.;","LIU, YANPING ","06/08/2017","05/31/2022","Advisory Committees; African American; Aging; Area; Basic Science; Behavioral; Biochemistry; Biomedical Research; Capital; Cardiology; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cardiovascular system; Caucasians; Center for Translational Science Activities; Cessation of life; Child; Clinical; Clinical Research; Clinical Sciences; Collaborations; Complex; Core Facility; Data; Development; disability; Discipline; Disease; disorder risk; Education; Effectiveness; Endocrinology; Ensure; Environment; Epidemiology; Evaluation; experience; Extramural Activities; Faculty; fetal; Fostering; Funding; Genetic; Genomics; Goals; Grant; Health; health disparity; Hypertension; improved; Incidence; infrastructure development; innovation; insight; interest; International; Kidney; Kidney Diseases; leadership development; Life; Light; Longevity; Low Birth Weight Infant; Medical center; meetings; Mentors; Metabolic; Metabolic Diseases; minority investigator; Mississippi; Molecular Biology; Monitor; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Mothers; multidisciplinary; National Institute of General Medical Sciences; Nephrology; Neurosciences; next generation; novel; Obesity; offspring; Outcome; Pathology; Pediatrics; Perinatal; Pharmacology; Physiology; Policies; Population; Population Research; Population Sciences; Pre-Eclampsia; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Prevalence; prevent; Process; programs; Proteomics; Psychiatry; Recruitment Activity; Reporting; Research; Research Infrastructure; Research Personnel; Research Project Grants; Research Proposals; Research Support; Scientist; Seasons; Services; study population; Training; Translations; undergraduate student; Underrepresented Minority; United States; United States National Institutes of Health; Universities; Woman; ","Mississippi Center of Excellence in Perinatal Research","121334","ZGM1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","1500000","783522","2283522",""

Twenty five percent of CHDs are critical CHDs (CCHD), defined as those requiring surgical or catheter intervention in the first year of life for survival. In Mississippi (MS), the incidence of some CCHDs is higher than in other similar U.S. populations. The hypotheses to be tested in this proposal are 1) that obesity and type II diabetes contribute to the increased incidence of CCHD in MS; 2) undiagnosed consanguinity among parents contributes to the elevated incidence of CCHD in MS; 3) that a standardized scoring system utilizing a limited number of sonographic images obtained at routine obstetric evaluation can reliably identify fetuses with CCHD or features suggestive/high risk of CCHD, indicating a need for full echocardiographic evaluation.  ","10911154; ","PARNELL, AIMEE S;","","06/08/2017","05/31/2022","Affect; African American; Area; Blood; Cardiac; Catheters; Censuses; Child; Chronic; Congenital Abnormality; Congenital Heart Defects; congenital heart disorder; Consanguinity; cost effective; Couples; Critical Congenital Heart Defects; Data; Detection; Development; Diagnostic; DNA; Echocardiography; Eligibility Determination; Environmental Risk Factor; Evaluation; fetal; Fetus; fetus at risk; Genetic; Genomics; health care availability; health service use; Healthcare; high risk; Hospitals; Image; improved; in utero; Incidence; Infant; infant death; instrument; Intervention; Life; Live Birth; Loss of Heterozygosity; maternal obesity; Measures; medically underserved population; Methods; migration; Mississippi; Neonatal; Newborn Infant; Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; novel; Obesity; Operative Surgical Procedures; Parents; Perinatal; Population; Population Attributable Risks; Pregnancy; prenatal; Prenatal care; Protocols documentation; Pulse Oximetry; Research; Role; Rural; rural area; rurality; screening; Specific qualifier value; Standardization; stem; Suggestion; System; telehealth; Testing; tool; Ultrasonography; Validation; ","Prenatal Screening and Mechanisms Responsible for Critical Congenital Heart Disease in Mississippi, a Rural and Medically Underserved Population","121334","ZGM1","Special Emphasis Panel ","6842","","01","198143","108567","","306710"

In cancer, the fidelity of chromosome segregation decreases so that individual chromosomes are often lost resulting in 'chromosomal instability' (CIN). Importantly, while moderate levels of CIN promote tumorigenesis, higher increases in the frequency of chromosome loss compromise cells' viability and suppress growth of tumors. Thus, attenuating the level of CIN can potentially be used a therapeutic approach. Achieving this goal requires an in-depth understanding of the mechanisms whose failure lead to chromosome missegregation.

Recently, mutations affecting the gene SRSF2 were discovered to be very common in MDS and related diseases. However, it remains unclear how these mutations affect the normal function of SRSF2 protein, how these mutations contribute to disease, and whether cells carrying these mutations may be vulnerable to new therapeutic approaches.

Recurrent pyelonephritis following surgical relief of obstruction argues against the theory that pyelonephritis arises entirely as a consequence of urine stasis. In this application, we will test the hypothesis that CON results in altered structural and functional properties of renal urothelium, thereby placing patients at risk for pyelonephritis and renal scarring.

While extremely promising, optimization and mechanistic studies are required to make these delivery peptides more effective. We will determine how the structure and chemical properties of these compounds affects their ability to penetrate cells. We will also establish how they cross biological membranes. This knowledge will provide a strong foundation for the rational design of delivery tools with properties optimized for future in vivo therapeutic applications.","8823050; ","PELLOIS, JEAN-PHILIPPE ;","AINSZTEIN, ALEXANDRA M","06/01/2015","05/31/2019","Affect; analog; Arginine; Biochemical; Biological; Biological Assay; biophysical analysis; cancer cell; Cells; chemical property; Chemical Structure; Chemicals; Complement; cytotoxicity; Data; design; Development; dimer; Dimerization; Disease; disulfide bond; Drug Delivery Systems; Endocytosis; Endosomes; Enteral; experimental study; Extravasation; Foundations; Future; Future Generations; Genes; human disease; Hydrophobicity; improved; in vivo; knock-down; Knowledge; Label; late endosome; Lead; Learning; Libraries; Liposomes; macromolecule; Masks; Mediating; Medical Research; Membrane; Methodology; Modeling; Molecular; Nucleic Acids; Organelles; Oxidative Stress; Patients; Penetration; Peptides; Problem Solving; Process; Property; Proteins; prototype; public health relevance; Rationalization; Reagent; Refractory; repaired; Research; Research Personnel; RNA; RNA Interference; Small Interfering RNA; Structure-Activity Relationship; System; Therapeutic; tool; trafficking; Tumor Suppressor Proteins; Variant; ","Mechanisms and optimization of endosomal escape for cell delivery applications","110137","BBM","Biochemistry and Biophysics of Membranes Study Section ","","","03","192500","85050","277550",""

The present goals are: 1) to develop a second-generation clinical candidate AAV vector of superior efficacy than that which currently exists for the correction of hoFH; and 2) to develop and optimize the first clinical candidate vector for the treatment of FLD. The objective is to optimize the transgene such that the minimum efficacious dose of both clinical candidate vectors is as low as possible. The overall intent of Project 2 is to lay the preclinical groundwork for conducting Phase I clinical trials using a second generation AAV-hLDLR for treatment of hoFH and the first AAV8-hLCAT for the treatment of FLD.","1901534; ","RADER, DANIEL JAMES;","MCDONALD, CHERYL ","","","adeno-associated viral vector; Apolipoprotein A-I; Atherosclerosis; Blood; Cholesterol; Chronic Kidney Failure; clinical candidate; Clinical Trials; Codon Nucleotides; Complementary DNA; Cyclization; Dependovirus; Development; Diet; Disease; Doctor of Medicine; Dose; Dyslipidemias; End stage renal failure; Engineering; Enzymes; Esterification; familial cholesteryl ester deficiency; Familial Hypercholesterolemia; Funding; gain of function; gene therapy; Generations; Genes; genetic regulatory protein; Goals; High Density Lipoproteins; Histopathology; Human; hypercholesterolemia; improved; Inherited; Kidney; Kidney Diseases; Knockout Mice; Life; lipid disorder; Liver; liver development; low density lipoprotein inhibitor; Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor; Low-Density Lipoproteins; Mediating; Metabolic Diseases; model development; mouse model; Mus; Mutation; particle; Patients; Phase I Clinical Trials; Phosphatidylcholine-Sterol O-Acyltransferase; Physiology; Plasma; Positioning Attribute; pre-clinical; premature; prevent; Proprotein Convertases; Proteins; Regulation; Resistance; restoration; Subtilisins; Testing; Therapeutic Intervention; Transgenes; Treatment Efficacy; Variant; vector; Viral; Work; ","Project 2 Optimizing Liver-Directed Gene Therapy for Inherited Dyslipidemia","059407","HLBP","Heart, Lung, and Blood Initial Review Group ","8340","","18","275924","155954","","431878"

Adverse or unstable family contexts may produce chronic stress in children due to the need for predictability in family relationships and adequate resources (of all types) for healthy child development. Chronic stress, in turn, may pose threats to children's physical, emotional and cognitive development. Understanding the extent to which increasingly diverse and unstable family environments are associated with chronic stress in children, and delineating pathways linking family structure, stress and child outcomes, are important next steps in family demography and child health research.

To enable the required spatial and temporal granularity in the analysis of protein functions in real time in living cells or organisms, we propose to develop acute and reversible photo-inactivation of endogenous proteins under endogenous transcriptional control as an entirely new approach to probe or screen in vivo protein activities. This is not currently possible with even the most sophisticated genetic tools that are essentially static compared to the time scale of most cellular and organismal processes.

Despite the known genetic cause, the pathogenic mechanisms of Rett Syndrome are not well understood, thus limiting the development of diagnosis and treatment options. We previously developed and characterized a mouse model carrying a Rett Syndrome-associated mutation on MeCP2. We found that these mice show similar Rett Syndrome-like symptoms and defects in neural network activity. Here we propose to investigate the function of MeCP2 in the proper development of neural network and to study the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the neuron cell type-specific function of MeCP2. A more precise understanding of the pathogenesis of Rett Syndrome will open the way to develop novel therapeutics to treat Rett Syndrome and other related autism spectrum disorders.

Thus, the studies should provide novel insights into the molecular basis of renal K handling and K homeostasis in health and disease while illuminating fundamental mechanisms of membrane protein targeting in the kidney.","1883547; ","WELLING, PAUL A;","KETCHUM, CHRISTIAN J.","06/07/2017","03/31/2021","Adaptor Signaling Protein; Address; Aldosterone; apical membrane; Automobile Driving; Binding Sites; Cellular biology; Chlorides; Clathrin; Clathrin Adaptors; Data; Dietary Potassium; Disease; Distal; driving force; Electrophysiology (science); Endocytosis; Ensure; Epithelial Cells; epithelial Na+ channel; Equilibrium; Excretory function; extracellular; Family; Funding; genome-wide analysis; Goals; Health; Homeostasis; hyperkalemia; Hypertension; Hypokalemia; Image; In Vitro; in vivo; insight; interdisciplinary approach; KCNJ1 gene; Kidney; kidney cell; Kidney Diseases; Knock-in Mouse; Knock-out; Knockout Mice; Laboratories; Life; Location; Lysosomes; MAPK7 gene; Mediating; member; Membrane; Membrane Proteins; Minerals; Molecular; Molecular Genetics; mouse model; Mus; Mutate; Nephrons; novel; Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man; Pathway interactions; Phenotype; Phosphotransferases; Physiological; Physiology; Play; Potassium; Potassium Channel; Potassium Deficiency; Principal Investigator; Process; programs; Proteins; Publishing; Recruitment Activity; Recycling; Role; Route; secretion process; Signal Transduction; Sodium; Sodium Chloride; Surface; Syndrome; System; Testing; Time; trafficking; Translating; Type II Pseudohypoaldosteronism; urinary; Variant; voltage; Work; ","Molecular Mechanism of ROMK Channel Function","054231","KMBD","Kidney Molecular Biology and Genitourinary Organ Development ","","A1","16","342114","153533","495647",""

We have recently developed a new mouse strain with an altered Autoimmune Regulator (Aire) gene which spontaneously manifests autoimmunity against the PNS. We will use this novel model of PNS autoimmunity to define which PNS proteins are primary target(s) of autoimmune attack and which components of the immune system contribute to the autoimmune response against the PNS. A better understanding of how the immune system destroys the PNS will inform us on how the immune system can be modulated for the prevention and treatment of CIDP.","8126625; ","SU, MAUREEN A;","NUCKOLLS, GLEN H.","06/01/2013","05/31/2018","Affect; Affinity; Antibodies; Antigens; Autoantibodies; Autoantigens; Autoimmune Diseases; Autoimmune Process; Autoimmune Responses; Autoimmunity; B-Cell Activation; B-Lymphocytes; Biological Response Modifiers; Blood group antigen S; Cells; Chronic; Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy; Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy; cytokine; Data; Defect; Demyelinations; Dendritic Cells; Development; Disease; Disease remission; Frequencies; Functional disorder; Gene Structure; Genes; Grant; Guillain-Barre Syndrome; Human; Immune; Immune system; Immune Tolerance; immunoregulation; Immunosuppressive Agents; in vivo; Individual; Infiltration; Injection of therapeutic agent; Lymphocyte Subset; Mediating; Minority; Modeling; Motor; mouse model; Mouse Strains; Mus; Mutation; Myelin P0 Protein; Neuropathy; novel; parallelization; Paresthesia; Pathogenesis; Pathogenicity; Patients; Peripheral; Peripheral Nervous System; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases; Play; Polyneuropathy; prevent; Prevention; Production; Proteins; public health relevance; Regulatory T-Lymphocyte; Reporting; Role; S-Adenosylmethionine; Sensory; T-Cell Development; T-Cell Receptor; T-Cell Receptor Genes; T-Lymphocyte; Testing; Thymic epithelial cell; Thymus Gland; transcription factor; ","Autoimmune mechanisms in a novel Aire-deficient model of peripheral neuropathy","079683","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","05","225734","107827","333561",""

In this project, we will evaluate the effects of in utero and perinatal exposure to antiretroviral drugs and HIV on the infant brain, using leading-edge neonatal magnetic resonance neuroimaging techniques and neurodevelopmental assessments.

Better information about which treatment to offer an individual patient (i.e., precision medicine) could improve efficacy while sparing patients from the toxicity of therapies that offer no benefit. The overall goal of our U54 application is utilize new technology platforms for predicting therapeutic response in which phenotypic and genomic properties are measured at the single cell level. By pursuing this goal, our center will establish a framework that enables an iterative cycle between novel single-cell measurements from clinically-relevant specimens and computational approaches that result in testable predictions.

GPCRs are a major target of modern drug therapy. An emerging paradigm in GPCR function, termed functional selectivity, significantly broadens the cellular effects of drugs that target GPCRs. We propose to develop new technologies to study GPCRs and use them to understand the molecular mechanisms that lead to functional selectivity. These studies will significantly enhance our understanding of GPCR function in diseases such as heart failure, diabetes and obesity. The novel technologies and insights gained through this research can be used to identify new drugs that exploit GPCR functional selectivity for improved treatments of these diseases.","8963539; ","SIVARAMAKRISHNAN, SIVARAJ ;","KODURI, SAILAJA ","07/01/2014","04/30/2018","Address; Adopted; Adrenergic beta-Antagonists; Adrenergic Receptor; Affinity; Agonist; Arrestins; bimanes; Binding; Biological Assay; Cell membrane; Cell Membrane Structures; Cells; Complement; Coupled; Cyclic AMP; design; Diabetes Mellitus; Disease; Drug Targeting; Event; Fluorescence; Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer; Future; G Protein-Coupled Receptor Signaling; G-Protein-Coupled Receptors; G-substrate; genetic regulatory protein; GTP-Binding Protein Regulators; GTP-Binding Proteins; Heart Diseases; Heart failure; Hormones; Human body; improved; Individual; insight; Lead; Length; Ligand Binding; Ligands; Light; Measurement; Membrane; Metoprolol; Modernization; Molecular; Molecular Conformation; Molecular Probes; Nature; new technology; novel; novel therapeutics; Obesity; Outcome; parallelization; Pathway interactions; peptide A; Peptides; Pharmacotherapy; Phosphotransferases; Preclinical Drug Evaluation; Process; protein activation; Protein Family; protein protein interaction; Proteins; public health relevance; Radio; receptor; receptor function; Reporting; Research; response; Role; S-Adenosylmethionine; scaffold; sensor; Signal Transduction; small molecule; small molecule therapeutics; Spasm; Specific qualifier value; Specificity; Stimulus; Structure; Surface; Techniques; Testing; Therapeutic; Toxin; Validation; Variant; ","Probing molecular mechanisms of GPCR functional selectivity in live cells","105646","MIST","Molecular and Integrative Signal Transduction Study Section ","","","05","190000","100383","290383",""

However, despite extensive rehabilitation efforts, marked physical inactivity remains emblematic of individuals in the chronic phase of stroke recovery and contributes to poor health and quality of life. For poststroke rehabilitation to be better positioned to enable more physical activity, factors such as insufficient training dosage and poor ecological validity, which limit the effectiveness of clinic-based gait training, must be overcome. In response to this need, we are developing a modular exosuit platform that can assist any combination of the paretic ankle, knee, and hip to increase an individual's walking capacity in the clinic or community through the unique use of force-transmitting, conformal textiles that anchor to the body, proximally-mounted cable-based actuation systems, wearable sensors, and adaptive control algorithms.","10720095; ","WALSH, CONOR ;","QUATRANO, LOUIS A","09/22/2016","05/31/2021","Algorithms; Ankle; Architecture; Chicago; Chronic Phase; Clinic; Clinical; Clinical Research; Communities; community setting; Complement; cost; Data; Development; disability; Distal; dosage; Effectiveness; efficacy study; Engineering; Evaluation; Evaluation Studies; exoskeleton; experience; Feedback; Focus Groups; functional restoration; Future; Gait; gait rehabilitation; gait symmetry; Goals; Head; Health; Hip region structure; Hospitals; Hour; Hybrids; Impairment; Individual; innovation; Institutes; Intuition; Joints; Knee; Leg; light weight; Limb structure; Mechanics; Metabolic; Monitor; Motion; Motor; multidisciplinary; Neuronal Plasticity; Neurorehabilitation; Noise; Paresis; Patients; Pattern; Performance; Persons; Phase; Physical activity; physical inactivity; Positioning Attribute; post stroke; Process; Protocols documentation; Quality of life; rehabilitation technology; Rehabilitation therapy; Research Personnel; Residual state; response; Robot; sedentary; sensor; Signal Transduction; Speed; stroke; stroke recovery; stroke rehabilitation; synergism; System; Technology; technology development; Testing; Textiles; Time; Training; Translations; treadmill; Update; Variant; Walking; walking program; walking stability; Weight; Work; ","Development of a Modular Soft Exosuit Platform Suitable for Community-Based Neurorehabilitation","088619","MRS","Musculoskeletal Rehabilitation Sciences Study Section ","","","02","454815","202384","657199",""

It is a proposal at an early stage of development that has a risk but very high potential payoff in the form of new, highly selective treatments for a number of autoimmune diseases.","1893226; 11611080 (contact); ","BLANKENHORN, ELIZABETH P; CHENG, HAO  (contact);","ESCH, THOMAS R.","06/09/2017","05/31/2019","Adjuvant; Adoptive Transfer; Adverse effects; Alginates; anergy; Animal Model; Animals; antigen processing; Antigens; Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor; Autoantigens; Autoimmune Diseases; Autoimmunity; Axon; Biocompatible; Biocompatible Materials; Biodistribution; biomaterial compatibility; Carboxylic Acids; CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes; Cell Communication; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell physiology; cell type; Cells; Clinical; clinical remission; Coculture Techniques; cytokine; Dendritic Cells; Development; Disease; Encapsulated; Environment; Epitopes; Esters; Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis; Flow Cytometry; Freund's Adjuvant; Goals; Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor; Human; Immune; Immune system; immunosuppressed; Immunosuppressive Agents; improved; In Situ; in vivo; Indoles; Inflammatory; Injectable; Injection of therapeutic agent; Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; ITGAX gene; Kinetics; Label; Lead; Ligands; lymph nodes; Measures; Methods; Mission; Modeling; Molecular Profiling; Motor Neurons; mouse model; Multiple Sclerosis; Mus; Myelin Sheath; nanoparticle; Natural immunosuppression; Neurons; novel; novel strategies; oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein; Pathogenicity; Patients; Peptides; Pertussis Toxin; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Polymers; Population; prevent; Process; Production; programs; Recruitment Activity; reduce symptoms; Regulatory T-Lymphocyte; Reporting; Research; Research Project Grants; Rheumatoid Arthritis; Risk; RNA Interference; Rodent; scaffold; Signal Transduction; spatiotemporal; Specificity; Spleen; Staining method; Stains; subcutaneous; Subcutaneous Injections; System; T-Cell Proliferation; T-Cell Receptor; T-Lymphocyte; Technology; Testing; Thiazoles; Thymus Gland; Time; Training; Travel; treatment strategy; United States National Institutes of Health; ","Injectable Biomaterial Scaffold for Inducing Antigen-Specific Tolerance","133372","BMBI","Biomaterials and Biointerfaces Study Section ","","","01","150000","84750","234750",""

Specifically, the transduction of T-cells with genes encoding chimeric antigen receptors and therapeutic payload enables T-cell recognition of antigens that are either poorly immunogenic or ignored by the immune system and successful tumor eradication. Our central theme and hypothesis is that tumor necrosis factor ?-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) overexpression by T-cells results in augmented apoptosis in tumor cells and that radiation and/or chemotherapy positively affects TRAIL-mediated tumor apoptosis during T-cell adoptive immunotherapy and can be used as a synergistic approach to enhance T-cell tumor targeting and effector function; here, we propose to develop new strategies for tumor sensitization to adoptive T-cell-based immunotherapies for subsequent translation to the clinic.","9350036; 7360149 (contact); ","ADUSUMILLI, PRASAD S.; PONOMAREV, VLADIMIR  (contact);","MENKENS, ANNE E","06/05/2017","05/31/2019","Adoptive Immunotherapy; Adverse effects; Affect; Antigens; Apoptosis; Apoptotic; Biological; Breast; cancer cell; cancer immunotherapy; Cancer Model; Cancer Patient; cancer therapy; cancer type; CAR receptor; Cells; Cessation of life; chemotherapeutic agent; chemotherapy; chimeric antigen receptor; Clinic; clinical application; Clinical Trials; Colorectal; cytotoxicity; Death Receptor 5; Disease remission; Dose; Ectopic Expression; Effector Cell; exhibitions; Exhibits; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Engineering; Glioma; Goals; Hormonal; Human; Image; Immune; Immune response; Immune system; immunogenic; Immunotherapeutic agent; Immunotherapy; improved; In Vitro; in vivo Model; innovation; irradiation; Killings; Ligands; Lung; Malignant neoplasm of lung; Malignant Neoplasms; Measurable; Measurement; Mediating; Membrane; mesothelin; Mesothelioma; Modality; Monitor; Mus; neoplastic cell; non-invasive imaging; non-invasive monitor; Normal Cell; novel; overexpression; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacology; pre-clinical; Process; Prodrugs; Prostate; Radiation; Radiation therapy; receptor; Recombinants; Reporter Genes; Resistance; response; Signal Transduction; Stimulus; Surface; T cell therapy; T-Lymphocyte; T-Lymphocyte and Natural Killer Cell; Testing; theranostics; Therapeutic; Time; TNF gene; TNFRSF10A gene; TNFRSF10B gene; TNFSF10 gene; TP53 gene; Translating; Translations; tumor; tumor eradication; Tumor Immunity; tumor xenograft; Whole-Body Irradiation; Work; Xenograft Model; ","Imaging the efficacy of TRAIL-enhanced cancer immunotherapy","213139","MEDI","Medical Imaging Study Section ","","A1","01","130500","95004","225504",""

Our group has successfully validated objective markers of disease progression using novel methods from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

NARRATIVE (PROJECT 1) Our recent discoveries indicate that CF lung disease is caused by defects in two key host defenses of the lungs: mucociliary transport (MCT) and antibacterial activity in airway surface liquid (ASL). Both of these defects are related to impaired CFTR mediated HCO3- secretion, resulting in abnormally acidic ASL and submucosal gland secretions. The series of experiments proposed will help us understand the relative importance of these CF host defense defects, will suggest whether targeting surface epithelia has clinical benefit, and will guide future gene transfer approaches.","1961843; ","MCCRAY, PAUL B;","SHERIDAN, JOHN T","","","adeno-associated viral vector; Age; airway inflammation; airway surface liquid; alkalinity; Anions; Anti-Bacterial Agents; antimicrobial; Area; Benchmarking; Bicarbonates; Biological Assay; Biological Markers; Birth; Cell surface; cell type; Cells; cellular transduction; Clinical; Complementary DNA; Cystic Fibrosis; cystic fibrosis airway; cystic fibrosis airway epithelia; Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator; Data; Defect; design; Disease; early cystic fibrosis; Epithelial; Epithelial Cells; Equilibrium; exhibitions; Exhibits; experimental study; Family suidae; Feline Immunodeficiency Virus; Ferrets; Future; gene therapy; Gene Transduction Agent; Gene Transfer; Genes; Gland; Host Defense; Host Defense Mechanism; Human; Impairment; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; Infection; Inflammation; insight; Ion Transport; Killings; Knowledge; Lentivirus Vector; Lung; Lung diseases; Measures; Mediating; Modeling; Mucociliary Clearance; Mucous body substance; novel; NUP214 gene; Physiological; prevent; programs; promoter; Property; Pulmonary Cystic Fibrosis; respiratory; Scientist; Series; Surface; System; Testing; therapeutic development; Thinking; Time; Transgenic Model; vector; Viral Vector; Viscosity; ","Gene Transfer to Porcine Respiratory Epithelia with Viral Vectors","051670","HLBP","Heart, Lung, and Blood Initial Review Group ","8356","","23","205364","107816","","313180"
