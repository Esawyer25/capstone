Current proposal investigates effects of microbial metabolite, UroA on colon cancer chemotherapy by utilizing cellular and preclinical colon cancer mouse models. Successful completion of these studies will have tremendous translational impact on utilization of microbial metabolites along with existing chemotherapeutic drugs in colon cancer.","9246960; ","JALA, VENKATAKRISHNA R;","KONDAPAKA, SUDHIR B","04/12/2017","03/31/2019","ABCG2 gene; abstracting; Address; Adjuvant; Adopted; Affect; Americas; analog; Anti-inflammatory; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Area; Azoxymethane; Bacteria; base; Berry; cancer cell; Cancer Etiology; Cancer Model; cancer therapy; cell motility; Cell Survival; Cessation of life; Chemosensitization; chemotherapy; Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure; clinically relevant; Colitis; Colon; colon cancer cell line; colon cancer patients; Colon Carcinoma; colon tumorigenesis; Combined Modality Therapy; Custom; Data; Development; Diet; Drug Efflux; Drug Regulations; Drug resistance; E-Cadherin; Ellagi-Tannins; Ellagic Acid; Epithelial; Epithelial Cells; Failure; Fluorouracil; Functional disorder; Genes; Goals; gut microbiota; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Immunomodulators; improved; indexing; Inflammation; Inflammatory disease of the intestine; innovation; Interleukin-6; iron metabolism; Knowledge; Lipopolysaccharides; macrophage; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; Mesenchymal; Methods; microbial; microbiota; Modeling; Molecular; Molecular Target; mortality; mouse model; Mus; neoplastic cell; novel; occludin; Oral Administration; P-Glycoprotein; Pathway interactions; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Play; Pomegranate; Population; pre-clinical; Pre-Clinical Model; Proteins; Resistance; response; Role; screening; Sodium Dextran Sulfate; stemness; synergism; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Effect; therapy development; three dimensional cell culture; TLR4 gene; TNF gene; Treatment Efficacy; tumor; United States; Xenograft Model; Xenograft procedure; ","PQ-10: Microbial metabolite, Urolithin A is  a potent immunomodulator and chemosensitizing adjuvant in treating colon cancer.","216090","ZCA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","108750","58725","167475",""

In particular, cardiac arrest is the leading cause of death in the United States and other developed countries. In public discussions, these deaths are often called ?heart attacks,? but in reality they most often occur as a result of lethal ventricular arrhythmias. Most cardiac arrest victims have coronary artery disease and healed myocardial infarctions, and, ventricular arrhythmias originating in the border between the healed myocardial infarction scar tissue and surviving cardiac myocytes cause the cardiac arrest. The devastating impact of cardiac arrhythmias is compounded by the absence of curative therapies. This proposal focuses on developing a comprehensive understanding of mechanisms that allow the existence of ventricular arrhythmias. We have preliminary data showing that alterations in key electrophysiological properties create conditions necessary for ventricular arrhythmias. In this proposal, we will explore the relationship between these underlying alterations in electrophysiology and arrhythmia mechanism, which we believe will be the first step toward developing new therapies to treat and potentially cure these devastating arrhythmias. To achieve the goals of this project, we take an integrative approach, studying a clinically relevant large mammalian model of post-infarct VT and comparing those findings to observations in humans. Successful completion of this proposal will provide a more thorough understanding of post-infarct VT mechanisms. This information can potentially lead to better diagnostic tests to identify patients at risk for sudden death, and ultimately it could lead to development of more specific and effective antiarrhythmic drug and gene therapies and ablation strategies to eliminate VT.","7684191; ","DONAHUE, J KEVIN;","LATHROP, DAVID A","04/15/2017","01/31/2021","Abbreviations; Ablation; Action Potentials; Address; Anatomy; Animal Model; Anti-Arrhythmia Agents; Area; Arrhythmia; Autopsy; base; Cardiac Myocytes; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cause of Death; Cessation of life; Characteristics; Cicatrix; Clinical Research; clinically relevant; Connexin 43; Connexins; Coronary Arteriosclerosis; curative treatments; Data; Death, Sudden, Cardiac; Developed Countries; Development; Diagnosis; Diagnostic tests; Down-Regulation; Electrophysiology (science); Elements; Etiology; Event; experience; Family suidae; Fibrosis; gene therapy; Genes; Goals; Healed; healing; Heart Arrest; Heterogeneity; Histology; Human; human disease; improved; Infarction; insight; Intercalated disc; Lead; Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction; Limb structure; Malignant - descriptor; Modeling; Molecular; Monitor; Muscle Cells; Myocardial; Myocardial Infarction; Myocardial tissue; Myocardium; novel therapeutics; patient oriented; Patients; Pharmacotherapy; Potassium; Potassium Channel; Pre-Clinical Model; Preclinical Testing; Probability; Property; Public Health; Publishing; Reporting; response; Risk; Role; Site; Sudden Death; Tachyarrhythmias; Testing; Time; Tissues; translational study; Translations; United States; Up-Regulation; Ventricular; Ventricular Arrhythmia; Ventricular Fibrillation; Ventricular Premature Complexes; Ventricular Tachycardia; ","Integrative analysis of electrophysiology in the healed myocardial infarction scar","134185","CICS","Clinical and Integrative Cardiovascular Sciences Study Section ","","A1","01","447414","258036","705450",""

Adverse exposures during pregnancy, such as to maternal metabolic diseases like obesity or diabetes, can have long term consequences due to changes in gene expression. These changes are believed to be caused by modification of proteins that bind to DNA, but the precise mechanisms are not well understood. If these modifications occur at genes with critical roles during development, the individual exposed to the adverse conditions may be at risk for birth defects, such as neural tube closure defects. The proposed research will investigate the role of protein modifications for adverse outcomes in a mouse model of diabetes in pregnancy.

Interestingly, psychostimulant abuse rates have also increased over this same time frame. While prescription psychotic drugs have clear therapeutic benefits, the abuse potential for these drugs in addition to other drugs of abuse, such as cocaine and amphetamines, remains a chronic problem in our county. Further, the mechanisms underlying the rewarding properties for abusive psychostimulants remain poorly understood. The proposed studies will directly examine the molecular targets in the brain of these therapeutic and addictive psychoactive drugs. My hope is that the results obtained will lead to greater understanding of the molecular underpinnings behind psychostimulant-induced reward. Having a greater understanding of these mechanisms will hopefully lead to novel therapeutic approaches for treating abuse disorders.","12314536; ","SWEENEY, CAROLYN GRAY;","BABECKI, BETH ","04/10/2015","04/09/2018","Acute; addiction; Address; Amphetamines; Antidepressive Agents; Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; Behavior; Behavioral; Binding; Binding Sites; Brain; Bupropion; career; Carrier Proteins; Cell Line; Cell membrane; Cell surface; Cell Surface Proteins; Cells; Chimera organism; Chimeric Proteins; Chronic; Co-Immunoprecipitations; Cocaine; Cognition; Complex; Corpus striatum structure; County; Data; Disease; Dopamine; dopamine transporter; Dopaminergic Cell; Down-Regulation; drug of abuse; Drug Prescriptions; Endocytosis; Energy Transfer; extracellular; Extracellular Space; Foundations; functional loss; Guanosine Triphosphate Phosphohydrolases; Health; In Situ; in vivo; Investigation; knock-down; Laboratories; Lead; Link; LoxP-flanked allele; Mediating; Methylphenidate; Microscopy; Molecular; Molecular Target; Motivation; Motor Activity; Movement; Mus; mutant; N-terminal; Neurobiology; Neurons; Neurosciences; novel therapeutic intervention; Parkinson Disease; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Physiological; Preparation; presynaptic; Process; Property; Protein Kinase C; psychostimulant; Psychotropic Drugs; Regulation; Reporting; response; Rewards; Ritalin; Role; Schizophrenia; Scientist; Signal Transduction; Slice; small hairpin RNA; stimulant abuse; Surface; Synapses; synergism; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Agents; Time; trafficking; Training; transmission process; Ubiquitin; Ubiquitination; United States; ","Rin GTPase And Dopamine Transporter Trafficking: Linking Mechanisms To Behavior","039592","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","03","30157","","30157",""

In this project we will study a phenomenon that we have discovered in the pilot studies, namely, that pathological factors typical of ALI and I/R unexpectedly stimulate targeting of nanocarriers directed some of these antibodies. In particular, this novel mechanism favors delivery to endothelial caveolae. These endocytic vesicles represent an important sub-cellular target in ALI and I/R. In inflammation, pathological agents acting via caveolae mediate endothelial abnormalities, which further aggravate such dangerous conditions as acute lung injury and ischemia- reperfusion. We will devise nanocarriers that deliver drugs intercepting pathological signaling in caveolar vesicles, appraise their benefit/risk ratio in animal models and initiate translation of the best prototypes into clincal medicine.","8255469; ","MUZYKANTOV, VLADIMIR R;","REINECK, LORA A","07/01/2015","03/31/2019","Acute; Acute Lung Injury; Adverse effects; Affect; Affinity; Animal Model; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Antibodies; Antioxidants; Binding; Blood; Blood Vessels; Caveolae; Cell Adhesion Molecules; Cells; chemotherapy; Clinical; clinically relevant; cytokine; Cytokine Signaling; design; Dose; Drug Controls; Drug Delivery Systems; Drug Targeting; Edema; Elements; Endocytic Vesicle; Endosomes; Endothelial Cells; Endothelium; Endotoxins; Engineering; flexibility; Formulation; Goals; Health; Human; improved; in vivo; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Injury; Intercept; Intervention; Ischemia; Life; Lung; lung ischemia; Lung Transplantation; Mediating; Medical; Medicine; Molecular; monolayer; mortality; mouse model; Mus; nanocarrier; NanoGel; nanomedicine; Neck; novel; Organ; Oxidative Stress; Oxidative Stress Pathway; Pathogenesis; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacotherapy; Pilot Projects; preclinical study; prophylactic; protective effect; prototype; Reactive Oxygen Species; Regimen; Reperfusion Injury; Reperfusion Therapy; risk benefit ratio; Sepsis; Signal Transduction; Site; subcellular targeting; success; Syndrome; targeted delivery; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Effect; Therapeutic Intervention; Time; Tissues; Translations; Transplantation; Trauma; vascular inflammation; Vesicle; ","Targeted nanomedicine for ALI and I/R","125462","NANO","Nanotechnology Study Section ","","","03","355901","213541","569442",""

Good glycemic control can inhibit DR in motivated patients, but is difficult or impossible for many to achieve and maintain. Likewise, other therapies (such as fibrates) seem to inhibit DR progression, but only in a subgroup of diabetic individuals. Thus, additional therapeutic approaches are needed to reduce vision loss in diabetes. The goal of this application is to identify novel, effective, and safe therapeutics that slow or halt the development and progression of DR in animal models as a prelude to clinical studies.","1880368; ","KERN, TIMOTHY S;","AGARWAL, NEERAJ ","04/01/2015","03/31/2020","Acute; Adenylate Cyclase; Adult; Adverse effects; Affect; Age; Agonist; Aldehydes; aminoguanidine; analytical method; Animal Model; Animals; antagonist G; base; Basic Science; Biochemistry; Biomedical Engineering; Blindness; Blood capillaries; Boston; Callithrix; capillary; Capillary Permeability; Cells; Characteristics; Chemicals; Clinical Research; Collaborations; Complex; Coupled; Developed Countries; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; diabetic; Diabetic mouse; Diabetic Retinopathy; Disease; Dose; Dropout; drug candidate; Drug Delivery Systems; Drug Kinetics; drug testing; Electrophysiology (science); Emerging Technologies; Eye; Fibrates; Formulation; G Protein-Coupled Receptor Signaling; G-Protein-Coupled Receptors; Generations; Glucose; glycemic control; Goals; Health; High Pressure Liquid Chromatography; high resolution imaging; Human; Image; imaging modality; improved; in vivo; Incubated; Individual; inhibitor/antagonist; Intervention; Ischemia; Lead; Lesion; Liquid Chromatography; liquid chromatography mass spectrometry; Longitudinal Studies; Mass Spectrum Analysis; Medicine; Methodology; Methods; Michigan; Modeling; Monitor; Monoclonal Antibody R24; mouse model; Mus; nanoparticle; National Eye Institute; Nerve Degeneration; novel; novel therapeutics; Ophthalmology; Optics; Oxidative Stress; Oxygen; Pathogenesis; Pathology; Patients; Pediatrics; Permeability; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacodynamics; Pharmacology; Photoreceptors; Physiological; prevent; Primates; Process; programs; Psychophysics; Reperfusion Therapy; Research Personnel; Resolution; Retina; Retinal; Retinal Diseases; Retinal Neovascularization; Rodent; Rodent Model; Route; screening; Selection Criteria; Signal Pathway; small molecule libraries; Staging; Structure; Subgroup; Superoxides; System; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Effect; tomography; tool; Translating; Translational Research; two-photon; type I and type II diabetes; type I diabetic; Universities; Vascular Permeabilities; Vision; Vision Disorders; Visual; Visual impairment; Visual system structure; Work; ","Novel therapies to inhibit diabetic retinopathy","024864","ZEY1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","03","1356661","259674","1616335",""

There is a current increasing effort to provide treatment and prevention strategies for individual living with HIV-1 infections in African countries that allow the control of the local epidemic. The 2017 INTEREST Conference will mainly address the scientific training of young African clinicians and scientists whose scope of is to 1) implement early diagnosis of HIV-1 infection and provide clinical care; 2) develop local strategies for monitoring of patients conditions; 3) implement prevention strategies; 4) study the acute phase of infection and understand the basis for the sustained activation of the immune system. The scientific training of the young African investigators will complement the ongoing efforts to develop local policy and improve care conditions. The three-day scientific Workshop will facilitate fostering local and international scientific interactions and expose the young African scientists to the state-of-the art knowledge in the specific areas of intervention against HIV-1 infection.

Though survival rates are vastly improved over previous military encounters, blast-exposed warfighters often report lingering neurological symptoms affecting multiple sensory systems as well as cognitive processes. These deficits may stem from a common source of neural dysfunction. Using behavioral and electrophysiological techniques, this research project will investigate the hypothesis that blast exposure degrades the brain's normal ability to ignore irrelevant sensory information, thus making it more difficult or blast-exposed Veterans to focus on information of interest. We predict that such poor filtering of sensory information is linked to common symptoms such as poor speech understanding in noise. Our intention is to improve knowledge regarding chronic neurological consequences of blast exposure in the hopes of informing future efforts to assess and rehabilitate blast-related symptoms in the Veteran population.","12156019; ","PAPESH, MELISSA ;","","12/01/2015","11/30/2017","Affect; Afghanistan; Age; Animals; Attention; Attenuated; Auditory; auditory rehabilitation; Auditory system; Auditory Threshold; Basic Science; behavior measurement; behavior test; Behavioral; Blast Cell; Blast Injuries; Brain; career; Chemicals; Chronic; Clinical; Clinical Data; Clinical Research; Cognition; Cognitive; cognitive function; cognitive process; Cognitive Therapy; combat; common symptom; Comorbidity; Comprehension; Conflict (Psychology); Control Groups; Data; Devices; Diagnostic; Electrophysiology (science); Ensure; Environment; experience; Exposure to; Functional disorder; Funding; Future; Hearing; Impairment; improved; Injury; Intention; interest; Intervention; Iraq; Knowledge; Lead; Linear Regressions; Link; Measures; Melissa; Memory; memory recall; Mental Health; Mentors; Mentorship; Military Personnel; Modality; Nature; Neurobehavioral Manifestations; Neurologic; Neuronal Dysfunction; Noise; noise perception; novel; Participant; Patient Self-Report; Patients; Performance; Population; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders; Process; Protocols documentation; public health relevance; Publications; Quality of life; Questionnaires; Reaction Time; Rehabilitation therapy; relating to nervous system; Reporting; Research; Research Project Grants; Research Proposals; Resources; response; selective attention; Sensory; sensory gating; sensory system; service member; Severities; Signal Transduction; sound; Source; Speech; Speech Perception; speech processing; stem; Stimulus; Stream; Stress; Survival Rate; sustained attention; Symptoms; System; Techniques; Test Result; Testing; tool; Training; Veterans; Work; ","Effects of Blast Exposure on Sensory Gating and Speech Perception in Noise","001820","RRD9","Career Development Program - Panel II ","","","02","","","",""

Our preliminary investigations indicate that cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) can bind growth factors such as bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), in a multivalent fashion, 1-10 BMPs per COMP. The central hypothesis of this R01 research is that one of the multivalent presentations of BMP by COMP greatly enhances BMP?s osteogenic activity, by impacting the BMP based cellular signaling processes. The research plan is designed to demonstrate the enhancement and unveil the mechanism and molecular players involved in the signaling cascades in vitro, then validate the concept in vivo. First, single-, di- to multi-valent binding sites will be engineered using nanotechnology to produce designed valence to present growth factor. Then, cellular responses to presentation will be systematically studied to reveal the mechanism; including clustering of BMP-receptors due to the multivalent-templates; recruiting of intracellular signal transduction proteins including Smad, p38, and Rho/ROCK based actin remodeling; and the resulting changes in gene expression. Next, the conditions (e.g., ratio and formulation) of COMP presentation of BMPs will be determined to ascertain the multivalency to promote cellular signaling cascades towards bone growth. Finally, the optimal formulation leading to the multivalent BMP presentations will be demonstrated in vivo using two clinically relevant rat models: spinal fusion, and critical sized femoral defects. The team is well poised to carry out the proposed interdisciplinary Aims described above; the PI has a solid record of research in cartilage matrix biochemistry, COMP and BMP growth factor biology. The PI and co-PIs have ongoing collaborations with the surgeon to perform the pre-clinical animal models, high-resolution bio-imaging and nanotechnology to perform proposed multivalent binding investigations. This R01 research represents the first comprehensive investigation of the impacts of growth factor presentation on osteogenesis, from in vitro protein binding, protein-cell interactions, cellular signaling processes, to in vivo validation. The impact of these studies will advance our understanding of growth factor activity and identify a means to regulate growth factor based osteogenic activities, with a translational focus to improve clinical delivery of growth factors with much reduced side effects. The conclusions from this investigation provide a new paradigm to regulate osteogenesis, and stem cell differentiation in general, i.e. by the molecular level engineering of growth factor presentation.","8256432; ","HAUDENSCHILD, DOMINIK R;","TYREE, BERNADETTE ","04/10/2017","01/31/2022","Actins; Adverse effects; Affect; American; Animal Model; Atomic Force Microscopy; base; Binding; Binding Proteins; Binding Sites; Biochemistry; bioimaging; Biology; BMP2 gene; bone; Bone Diseases; Bone Growth; bone growth factor; Bone Injury; bone morphogenetic protein receptors; Bone Morphogenetic Proteins; Bone Regeneration; Buffers; Cartilage; Cartilage Matrix; Cell Communication; Cell Therapy; Cells; Clinic; Clinical; clinically relevant; Collaborations; Data; Defect; design; dosage; Dose; effective therapy; Engineering; Environment; Extracellular Matrix; FDA approved; Formulation; Fracture; Gene Expression; Generic Drugs; Glues; Goals; Growth Factor; high resolution imaging; Homeostasis; Homo; Imaging Device; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; Individual; insight; Investigation; Knowledge; macromolecular assembly; mammalian COMP; MAPK14 gene; Mediating; Membrane; microscopic imaging; Modeling; Modern Medicine; Molecular; molecular modeling; Molecular Models; monomer; Nanotechnology; Natural regeneration; Nature; neutralizing antibody; novel strategies; Osteogenesis; osteogenic; Patients; Peptides; Physiologic Ossification; Physiological; pre-clinical; Pre-Clinical Model; Protein Binding Domain; protein complex; protein function; Proteins; Proteoglycan; Rattus; receptor; reconstitution; Recruitment Activity; repaired; Research; Research Personnel; Resolution; response; rho; signal processing; Signal Transduction; Site-Directed Mutagenesis; Solid; Spinal; Spinal Fusion; stem cell differentiation; Stem cells; Structure; Surgeon; Swimming; Testing; Time; Translating; Transmission Electron Microscopy; Validation; Work; ","Multivalent Presentation of Growth Factors Regulates Cellular Responses","070239","SBSR","Skeletal Biology Structure and Regeneration Study Section ","","A1","01","220000","97570","317570",""

Because of Neurofeedback's labor-intensive cost (1 treatment costing as much as a month's medication), it is important to know how much specific benefit it yields. This 2- site placebo-controlled double-blind randomized clinical trial is the first to testfor a specific benefit of neurofeedback with adequate power, the first designed and implemented collaboratively by experts in neurofeedback, ADHD, and clinical trials, the first to rigorously monitor quality not only of treatment, but also of placebo and blinding, and the first to follow up for 2 years to examine enduring effect; the results, whether positive or negative, will provide evidence for clinical practice and public policy regarding ADHD.","6447710; ","ARNOLD, L.

This project will utilize a novel technology called optic coherence tomography (OCT) with deep retinal neuronal layer segmentation to image neurons in the inner and outer nuclear layers of the retina and study how they degenerate. These data will be used in longitudinal models to determine if retinal degeneration can predict GM atrophy in other parts of the brain and clinical disability. Understanding the mechanisms of neurodegeneration and developing predictive imaging biomarkers of neurodegeneration is critically important for developing better therapies to target this untreatable aspect of MS, which ultimately is what causes long-term disability, loss of quality of life, premature departure from the work-force and billions of dollars cost to society.","6130429; ","CALABRESI, PETER A;","UTZ, URSULA ","04/01/2013","03/31/2018","Acute; Angiography; Animals; Atrophic; axon injury; Back; Blood-Retinal Barrier; Brain; Brain region; cerebral atrophy; Clinical; CNS processing; cohort; cost; Data; Demyelinations; disability; Disease; Disease Progression; Dropout; Evaluation; experimental study; Extravasation; Eye; Fluorescein; Functional disorder; Ganglion Cell Layer; gray matter; Health; Image; imaging biomarker; Immune; in vivo; Inflammation; Inner Nuclear Layer; Inner Plexiform Layer; insight; Lesion; Link; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Measures; Mediating; Methods; Modeling; Multiple Sclerosis; multiple sclerosis patient; Myelin; Nerve Degeneration; Neurologic; neuron loss; Neurons; new technology; novel; Nuclear; Ophthalmic examination and evaluation; optic nerve disorder; Optic Nerve Transections; Optic Neuritis; Optical Coherence Tomography; Optics; Outcome; Pathology; Patients; Pattern; Phenotype; Predisposition; premature; Process; Quality of life; Recruitment Activity; Resolution; Retina; retina outer nuclear layer; Retinal; Retinal Degeneration; retinal nerve fiber layer; Site; Societies; Structure; Swelling; Testing; Thick; Time; tomography; Waxes; white matter; white matter injury; Work; ","Imaging neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis","082347","CNBT","Clinical Neuroimmunology and Brain Tumors Study Section ","","","05","196875","122062","318937",""

Intriguingly, the ability of recombinant HRS to activate Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and associated MyD88-dependent signaling cascades suggests that our models of HRS-induced myositis may provide a more general framework for understanding subtypes of muscular dystrophy as well as other inflammatory muscle diseases involving downstream activation of the key transcription factor NF-?B (including those disorders associated with sepsis, trauma, and/or ischemia). Therefore, as a prelude to the development of novel therapeutic agents for autoimmune as well as non-autoimmune muscle inflammation, this proposal will define the relationship between immune dysregulation, aberrant NF-?B-mediated molecular signaling cascades, and muscle dysfunction in HRS-induced myositis.","7169663; ","ASCHERMAN, DANA P;","MANCINI, MARIE ","04/10/2017","03/31/2022","adaptive immunity; Adverse effects; Antigens; Assessment tool; Autoantigens; Autoimmune Process; Autoimmunity; B-Lymphocytes; base; Binding; Biochemical; Biological Assay; Biopsy Specimen; Cell Death; cell motility; Cell physiology; Cells; comparative trial; Complex; cytokine; Development; Disease; Fatty acid glycerol esters; Foundations; Functional disorder; Functional Imaging; General Population; Genetic Transcription; Hand Strength; Histidine-tRNA Ligase; Human; human disease; Idiopathic Inflammatory Myopathies; Immune; immune activation; Immune response; Immune Targeting; Immunization; In Vitro; in vivo; Infiltration; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Injury; insight; Interleukin-1; Intramuscular; Ischemia; Knock-out; Knockout Mice; Laboratories; Link; Luciferases; Lymphocyte; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Mediating; Modeling; Molecular; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Mus; Muscle; Muscle Cells; muscle degeneration; Muscle Weakness; Muscular Dystrophies; Myoblasts; myogenesis; Myopathy; Myositis; Natural Immunity; novel therapeutics; Organ; Pathogenesis; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Peptides; Phenotype; Play; prevent; Process; Production; Proteins; Receptor Signaling; receptor-mediated signaling; Recombinants; regenerative; Role; Sepsis; Series; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; System; systemic autoimmune disease; T-Cell Activation; T-Cell Receptor; T-Lymphocyte; targeted treatment; Therapeutic Agents; Therapeutic immunosuppression; therapeutic target; Tissues; TLR2 gene; TLR4 gene; TNF gene; Toll-like receptors; tool; trafficking; transcription factor; Transgenic Mice; Trauma; Treatment Efficacy; Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor; Vascular Endothelium; Work; ","Innate Immune Activation in Autoimmune Myopathy","071369","ACTS","Arthritis, Connective Tissue and Skin Study Section ","","","01","273744","106283","380027",""

In the United States, an estimated 1 million people are currently living with HIV and approximately 40,000 infections occur each year. There is no vaccine against HIV, and AIDS, if untreated, will lead to the death of over 95% of infected individuals 10 years post-infection. HIV infects several cell types during the course of infection and progression to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The persistence of latent HIV-infected cellular reservoirs represents the major hurdle to virus eradication with anti-retroviral therapy (ART), since latently infected cells remain a permanent source of viral reactivation. It has been hypothesized that intensification of ART could reduce the residual viremia but recent studies strongly suggest that this is not the likely scenario. Moreover, ART is problematic because of long-term toxicity, drug resistance, and the inability to target and eliminate persistent viral reservoirs. Therefore, other pharmacological approaches targeting the HIV-1 reservoir have been suggested by several investigators as a promising strategy to develop new drugs able to activate latent HIV-1 without inducing global T cell-activation. We propose to develop a unique combination therapy consisting of a PKC modulator and an HDAC inhibitor to reactivate these latent HIV reservoirs so that HIV-1 can be eliminated by ART and eradicated from the patient?s body. Our approach has the potential for advancing HIV therapy towards sterilizing cure, which currently is out of reach.","1872578; ","CASTOR, TREVOR P.;","SANDERS, BRIGITTE E.","08/01/2016","07/31/2018","Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Agonist; animal efficacy; Animal Model; Anti-Retroviral Agents; Antibody Binding Sites; aqueous; Biodistribution; Blood Circulation; bryostatin; burden of illness; CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell Death; cell type; Cells; Cessation of life; Chronic Disease; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials; Combined Modality Therapy; Communicable Diseases; Cyclic GMP; cytotoxicity; Data; design; Developed Countries; Disease; Drug Combinations; Drug resistance; Economic Burden; Encapsulated; Engineering; Evaluation; experience; Generations; Genetic Transcription; Goals; Head; Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor; HIV; HIV Infections; HIV therapy; HIV-1; Hospitals; Human; humanized mouse; Immune system; Immunologist; Immunotherapy; in vivo; in vivo Model; Inbred BALB C Mice; Individual; Infection; Institutes; Latent Virus; Lead; Legal patent; Licensing; Life; Liposomes; Liquid substance; Lytic; Macaca; Maryland; Medical; medical schools; Medicine; meetings; Membrane Lipids; Modeling; mouse model; multidisciplinary; nanobodies; Neoadjuvant Therapy; neutralizing antibody; novel therapeutics; Outcome; Patients; PDCD1LG1 gene; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacologic Substance; Phase; Phase I Clinical Trials; preclinical study; Principal Investigator; Process; product development; professor; programs; Protein Kinase C; Protocols documentation; purge; Research; research and development; Research Personnel; residence; Residual state; simian human immunodeficiency virus; Source; Spain; systemic toxicity; T-Cell Activation; Therapeutic; Time; Toxic effect; Track and Field; treatment effect; United States; Universities; Vaccines; Viral; Viral Load result; Viral reservoir; Viremia; virology; Virus; Vorinostat; ","Purging Latent HIV Reservoirs through a Combination HIV Therapeutic","124819","","","","A1S1","01","","","50000",""

Collectively, miRNAs mediate broad gene regulatory networks with substantial impact on disease and cancer. Special Ago proteins, such as mammalian Ago2, have the ability to cleave target transcripts. This enzymatic activity, referred to as 'Slicing', underlies the powerful experimental tecnique of RNA interference, but the endogenous biological significance of Slicing is poorly understood. Our previous and ongoing studies demonstrate that in mammals, Slicing activity is intimately and fundamentally tied to the erythroid system. In particular, we show that there are multiple non-canonical biogenesis mechanisms for erythroid-restricted miRNAs that uniquely require Ago2-Slicing activity. We propose a combination of biochemical, molecular, genetic, and genomewide studies to elucidate the biological requirements of non-canonical erythroid miRNAs, and how they surprisingly underlie the blood defects of Slicing-defective mammals.","9603277; 8706809 (contact); ","KHARAS, MICHAEL ; LAI, ERIC C (contact);","KLAUZINSKA, MALGORZATA ","04/10/2017","01/31/2021","Address; Archaea; base; Basophilic Erythroblast; Biochemical; Biochemical Genetics; Biogenesis; Biological; Biology; Blood; Catalysis; Cells; Cleaved cell; cohort; Complex; crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing; Data; Databases; Defect; Deposition; Development; Disease; Engraftment; Enzymes; Erythroid; erythroid differentiation; Exhibits; experimental study; Foundations; functional loss; Generations; Genetic; genetic analysis; Genetic Enhancement; Genetic Epistasis; Genetic screening method; Genetic study; genome-wide; Genomics; Heart; Hematopoietic; Hematopoietic Neoplasms; Hematopoietic System; Homeostasis; In Vitro; in vivo; Individual; insight; Knock-out; knockout animal; Knockout Mice; leukemia; loss of function; Malignant - descriptor; Malignant Neoplasms; Mammals; man; Mediating; Methods; MicroRNAs; Molecular Analysis; Molecular Genetics; Mus; mutant; Mutant Strains Mice; Natural regeneration; novel; Nucleotides; overexpression; oxidant stress; Pathway interactions; Perinatal; Phenotype; Play; Positioning Attribute; Post-Transcriptional Regulation; Process; Proteins; PTEN gene; Reaction; Regulation; Regulator Genes; Reporting; Repression; response; RNA; RNA Interference; Role; Series; Severities; Signal Transduction; Slice; Small RNA; Stress; Study models; System; T-Lymphocyte; Testing; Transcript; transcriptome; transcriptome sequencing; Virus; Work; ","Molecular and genetic analysis of novel Slicer-dependent miRNA pathways in blood","135564","MCH","Molecular and Cellular Hematology Study Section ","","","01","407612","291035","698647",""

The impact of this devastating disease will increase enormously as the world population continues to age. The mechanisms that contribute to post-ischemic injury and neurological dysfunction after stroke are not completely understood, and most clinical trials conducted to save neuronal function to date for stroke therapeutics have failed. Failure to consider white matter (WM) injury is a critical gap in the development of successful stroke therapy. An ideal stroke therapeutic must not only be directed towards neuronal and axonal protection across age, but also must restore function when applied after injury. Post-ischemic application of the Class I HDAC inhibitor MS-275 protects neurons, axons, and glial cells and restores function in young and aging brain by preserving mitochondria. Therefore we will determine the mechanisms of post-ischemic protection conferred by Class I HDAC inhibition in young and aging WM. The overall goal of this project is to test if Class I HDAC inhibition can be used to develop novel therapies to help aid recovery after stroke.","8597405; ","BALTAN, SELVA ;","MACKIEWICZ, MIROSLAW ","09/01/2010","03/31/2022","abstracting; Achievement; Affect; Age; age related; Aging; aging brain; Attenuated; Axon; base; Biochemical; Brain; Cause of Death; cell age; Cell Aging; cell injury; cell motility; Conduct Clinical Trials; deprivation; design; Development; disability; Disease; Electrophysiology (science); Epigenetic Process; excitotoxicity; experience; experimental study; Failure; functional restoration; Funding; Gene Proteins; Genetic; Genetic Transcription; Glucose; Goals; gray matter; Health; Histone Deacetylase; Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor; In Vitro; in vivo; Injury; insight; Ischemia; Light; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; Membrane Potentials; MicroRNAs; Mitochondria; mitochondrial dysfunction; Molecular; mouse model; MS-275; Mus; Neuroglia; Neurologic Dysfunctions; neuronal survival; Neurons; Nitric Oxide Synthase; novel; novel therapeutics; Oxidative Stress; Oxygen; Pathogenesis; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase III Clinical Trials; Physiological; Population; prevent; promoter; Protein Acetylation; Protein Isoforms; Recovery; Recovery of Function; Recruitment Activity; Regulation; Regulator Genes; Research; Risk; Role; stroke; stroke therapy; Structure; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Intervention; United States; white matter; white matter injury; ","Vulnerability of Aging White Matter to Ischemia","033720","NOMD","Neural Oxidative Metabolism and Death Study Section ","","A1","07","205000","122231","327231",""

Alcohol use likely disrupts sleep in a fashion that impairs cognitive function the next day. Alcohol and sleep-disruption may result in impairment in such cognitive domains as executive function and learning as well as sleepiness that actually perpetuate the problematic alcohol use. While some evidence of these associations exists in young adults, there is remarkably little research addressing these phenomena in mature adults who are less cognitively resilient than young adults, in women as compared to men, or over multiple night of alcohol exposure (that most likely mimics alcohol use in those with alcohol use disorders). Accordingly, this proposal sets out to fill fundamental gaps in knowledge in the relationships between alcohol, sleep and next day cognitive function after multiple nights of alcohol consumption in mature heavy-drinking adults. Findings from these studies may provide key insights into these problems and point to treatment targets that will improve the outcomes of individuals who are trying to stop drinking.","1882610 (contact); 6146975; ","CARSKADON, MARY A (contact); MCGEARY, JOHN E;","REGUNATHAN, SOUNDAR ","04/10/2017","03/31/2022","abstracting; Address; Adult; Affect; Age; Alcohol abuse; Alcohol consumption; alcohol effect; alcohol exposure; alcohol misuse; alcohol use disorder; Alcohols; alertness; Area; base; Behavioral; breath alcohol measurement; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.); Cognitive; Cognitive deficits; cognitive function; cost; Data; Development; drinking; Drowsiness; Educational process of instructing; Effectiveness; Employee Strikes; Ethanol Metabolism; executive function; Female; fundamental research; Future; Goals; hands-on learning; Heavy Drinking; Impairment; improved; improved outcome; Individual; innovation; insight; Intervention; Knowledge; Laboratories; Laboratory Research; Learning; Learning Skill; male; men; mindfulness; neurobehavioral; Neurocognitive; Patients; Performance; Physiology; Positioning Attribute; prevent; psychosocial; Psychotherapy; REM Sleep; Research; Schedule; Scientist; skills; Sleep; Sleep disturbances; Slow-Wave Sleep; Study Subject; Testing; Time; Treatment outcome; United States; Wit; Woman; Work; young adult; ","Serial Nights of Alcohol Administration:  Impact on Sleep and Next-Day Neurocognitive Function and Alertness","025593","MESH","Biobehavioral Mechanisms of Emotion, Stress and Health Study Section ","","A1","01","378693","77226","455919",""

Abstinence from alcohol may indicate a successful outcome; however, there is growing recognition that AUD recovery is more complex than achieving abstinence and defining treatment success primarily by consumption alone often fails to adequately portray the recovery process. Efforts to move toward non-consumption, clinically meaningful outcome measures (e.g., reduced alcohol-related problems) have been largely limited by the untested assumption that consumption measures are more sensitive than non- consumption measures and by the lack of research identifying 'gold standard' non-consumption measures.

The application of this knowledge to companion diagnostics and companion therapeutics is now quickly transforming research and clinical practice. In addition, so-called targeted DNA sequencing of selected genomic loci is more cost effective than whole genome sequencing (WGS), facilitates higher sample throughput and optimized coverage, eliminates ambiguities and improves accuracy by greatly reducing the complexity of the DNA to be sequenced. Current methods for genomic targeting however remain a severely limiting factor for resolving complex genomic loci because they do not provide the large size fragments required to span confounding sequences. We will fill this need with a large-fragment enrichment method, RSE, which will permit direct long-read next- generation sequencing after enrichment, including the ability to detect methylation on several NGS systems. This combination will significantly improve the ability of researchers and clinicians to obtain complete and accurate characterizations of complex genomic variations and regions in disease.","8343961; ","DAPPRICH, JOHANNES ;","SMITH, MICHAEL ","04/12/2017","03/31/2018","Address; Adult; Aging; base; Base Sequence; bisulfite; carcinogenesis; Child; Childhood; Chromosomal Rearrangement; Clinical; clinical practice; companion diagnostics; Companions; Complex; cost; cost effective; Data; design; Detection; Developmental Biology; Disease; disease diagnosis; DNA; DNA Methylation; DNA Sequence; Elements; Feedback; flexibility; FMR1; Fragile X Syndrome; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetic; Genetic Research; genome sequencing; Genomic DNA; Genomic Imprinting; Genomic Segment; genomic variation; Genomics; Goals; Guanine + Cytosine Composition; Haplotypes; human genomics; improved; Industry Collaboration; insight; instrument; integration site; interest; Knowledge; Length; Libraries; Link; Malignant Neoplasms; Manuals; Medical Research; Methods; Methylation; Molecular Weight; nanopore; Neurologic; next generation sequencing; open source; operation; outcome forecast; Patient Monitoring; Phase; platform-independent; Preparation; Process; Protocols documentation; Reading; repaired; Repetitive Sequence; Repression; Research; Research Personnel; Resolution; Sampling; sequencing platform; Site; Specificity; Streptavidin; System; Techniques; Technology; Testing; Therapeutic; Variant; Virus Integration; whole genome; Work; ","Amplification-Free Target Enrichment and Direct Sequencing of Large Chromosomal Segments","009580","ZHG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","","","258180",""

Consequently, this can lead to potential adverse outcomes due to suboptimal MHC matching. Arima Genomics recently extended our innovative HaploSeq technology as a novel, cost-effective approach to accurately haplotype the entire human MHC locus at high resolution to phase HLA genes, non-HLA genes and non-coding elements in a single haplotype.

Integrins are essential for the survival and function of most organisms, from protozoa to humans. Integrins and their activation is a key event in thrombosis, inflammation, vascular organization and development as well as vascular diseases. Abnormalities in integrin expression or function lead to severe diseases in humans. We will assess how integrin activity is regulated during developmental and pathological vascularization and will define the mechanisms of this process. We will focus on one of the least understood cell types, microglia, in the eye. These cells are actively involved in organization of vascular architecture but the mechanisms and the precise function are not understood. Together, these studies will advance our understanding of severe human diseases associated with integrin or kindlin deficiencies and will help with immediate treatment of these patients.

PTSD not only worsens TBI symptoms, such as cognitive impairments, in the delayed post- deployment period, but it also causes TBI symptoms to persist for a longer duration and confounds diagnosis and treatment. Together, these data indicate that comorbidity of TBI and PTSD significantly impacts the rehabilitative progress of TBI patients. One mechanism implicated in the cognitive impairments found in comorbid PTSD-TBI is cortical hypoactivation, a condition associated following either TBI or PTSD alone. This project aims to address the long-term effects of PTSD-TBI on cognitive behaviors resulting from molecular, structural and functional cortical impairments and to investigate long-lasting rehabilitation strategies, such as neurotherapeutic interventions, which can be implemented upon return from active duty. Thus, these studies are highly relevant to the mission for VA patient care and rehabilitation.","6467359; ","CONTI, ALANA C.;","","01/01/2015","12/31/2018","Address; Affect; Afghanistan; AMPA Receptors; associated symptom; Attention; Behavior; behavior measurement; Behavioral; behavioral outcome; Cognitive; combat; Comorbidity; Conflict (Psychology); Creatine; Data; design; Diagnosis; Dose; Energy Metabolism; experience; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; functional outcomes; Glutamate Transporter; Glutamates; Glutamine; gray matter; Health; Human; imaging modality; Imaging Techniques; Impaired cognition; Impairment; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; Injury; innovation; Inositol; Intervention; Iraq; Knowledge; Long-Term Effects; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Manganese; Measurement; Measures; Mediating; Medical; Memantine; mild traumatic brain injury; Military Personnel; Mission; Modeling; Molecular; molecular marker; Morphology; mouse model; Mus; N-acetylaspartate; N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors; nervous system disorder; neurochemistry; Neuroglia; Neuronal Plasticity; Neurons; neurotransmission; Neurotransmitters; novel; object recognition; operation; Outcome; Patient Care; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacotherapy; Population; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders; preclinical study; Prefrontal Cortex; Prevalence; Protons; Receptor Activation; receptor expression; Recovery; rehabilitation management; rehabilitation strategy; Rehabilitation therapy; Risk; Stress; Structure; Symptoms; Techniques; Testing; Tissues; tool; Traumatic Brain Injury; Veterans; Weight; ","Longitudinal Assessment of Cortical Hypoactivity in a Model of Comorbid TBI-PTSD","001511","RRD1","Brain Injury: TBI & Stroke  ","","","03","","","",""

Evidence of loss of  susceptibility to antileishmanial drugs has been demonstrated in some cases of treatment failure. However, the  multifactorial basis of the therapeutic response and diversity of Leishmania confound attempts to correlate  clinical outcome with in vitro drug susceptibility. Furthermore, discernment of the relationship between in vitro  susceptibility and clinical response is severely hampered by the limited capacity of health systems to monitor  adherence to and outcome of treatment. Through combined retrospective and prospective evaluation of  therapeutic responsiveness and novel approaches to evaluation of drug susceptibility of Leishmania, this  project provides a unique opportunity to determine the contribution of drug resistance in treatment failure,  optimize treatment and develop tools for pharmacovigilance in endemic areas of cutaneous leishmaniasis.","9543894; ","GORE SARAVIA, NANCY ;","","04/15/2017","03/31/2022","Adherence; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Antifungal Agents; antimicrobial; antimicrobial drug; Apoptosis; Area; base; Cell Line; Cells; chemotherapy; Clinical; Clinical Data; clinical phenotype; clinically relevant; Coculture Techniques; Collection; comparative; Cutaneous Leishmaniasis; Data; Databases; design; Detection; Development; Disease; Drug Evaluation; Drug Formulations; Drug resistance; Drug usage; effective therapy; Effectiveness; Environment; evidence base; experience; Frequencies; frontier; Future; Gene Expression Profiling; Genetic Markers; genome-wide; Genotype; Goals; Health system; Human; Immune; immune activation; Immune response; In Vitro; in vivo; Individual; Infection; Inflammatory; Inflammatory Response; innovation; Integration Host Factors; Killings; Kinetics; knock-down; Laboratories; Latin America; Leishmania; Leishmaniasis; Lesion; Longevity; macrophage; Measures; Mediator of activation protein; Meglumine; Methods; Miltefosine; Monitor; Morbidity - disease rate; Mus; neglect; neutrophil; Neutrophil Activation; novel; novel strategies; Organism; Outcome; Parasite resistance; Parasites; Pathway interactions; Patients; Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phenotype; Policies; Population; Predisposition; prospective; Randomized Clinical Trials; Resistance; response; screening; Single Nucleotide Polymorphism; Staging; standard of care; symposium; System; Testing; Therapeutic; therapeutic evaluation; therapy development; therapy outcome; tool; transcriptome; transcriptome sequencing; transcriptomics; Treatment Failure; Treatment outcome; treatment response; Validation; ","Parasite Drug Susceptibility in The Response To Anti-Leishmanial Treatment","129910","ZAI1","Special Emphasis Panel ","5721","","01","97141","7371","","104512"

Three differentially spliced isoforms of UBE3A have been identified; however, it is not known which isoform plays the most critical role in Dup15q. Since UBE3A is imprinted specifically in neurons, this project will test the hypothesis that elevated UBE3A in neurons is the major contributor to Dup15q phenotypes.

In addition, the application will support the mentoring of a cadre of junior nurse researchers who potentially can dramatically accelerate the application of sleep research to diverse populations to improve symptoms and empower patient's self-care management.","6914842; ","CHASENS, EILEEN R;","ROOF, REBECCA ","04/14/2017","03/31/2020","actigraphy; Adult; Affect; American; Area; Behavior; Behavior Control; Behavior Therapy; Behavioral; blood glucose regulation; career development; Chronic Disease; Cognitive Therapy; Continuous Positive Airway Pressure; Control Groups; Counseling; Data; Development; diabetes control; diabetes education; Diabetes Mellitus; Diet; Distress; doctoral student; Dose; Drowsiness; Education; empowered; empowerment; Enrollment; Faculty; Fatigue; Generic Drugs; glycemic control; Goals; Health; Impaired health; improved; improved outcome; Individual; innovation; Internet; Intervention; Knowledge; Link; Medical; Medicine; meetings; Mentors; Mission; Modeling; Moods; Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; Nurses; Obstructive Sleep Apnea; Online Systems; parent grant; Parents; Participant; Patients; Persons; Physical activity; Physiological; Pilot Projects; Population; Population Heterogeneity; post intervention; Postdoctoral Fellow; prevent; programs; Quality of life; Randomized; Randomized Clinical Trials; randomized trial; Research; Research Personnel; Research Project Grants; Risk; Role; Sampling; Science; Scientist; Self Care; Self Management; Severities; skills; Sleep; Sleep Disorders; Sleep Fragmentations; Sleeplessness; symptom management; symptom science; symptom self management; symptomatic improvement; Symptoms; Testing; Time; treatment effect; treatment program; ","Self-Management, Insomnia, and Glucose Control in Adults with Diabetes","016685","NRRC","National Institute of Nursing Research Initial Review Group ","","A1","01","114587","9017","123604",""

With the advent of antiretroviral therapy (cART), the prevalence of HIV associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) is increasing as infected individuals live longer. Opiate abuse is often associated with enhanced severity of the neurological and cognitive deficits elicited by HIV infection of the CNS. Although cART suppresses HIV replication, additional therapeutic strategies are needed to limit HAND, in HIV infected opiate abusers as well as in non drug abusing infected people. Buprenorphine is used to treat opiate addiction, but little is known about the consequences of this opioid substitution treatment on HIV neuropathogenesis. Mature peripheral blood monocytes play a key role in mediating HIV infection of the CNS and subsequent neuroinflammtion, both of which contribute significantly to HAND. These mature monocytes express opioid receptors that elicit functional effects in these cells upon activation. In a study of HIV infected individuals with opioid dependency, mental and physical health-related quality of life was improved over time with buprenorphine The mechanisms by which buprenorphine mediates these effects are not well characterized Our preliminary data suggest that buprenorphine inhibits the migratory phenotype of inflammatory mature monocytes in vitro, and in preclinical studies we also showed that buprenophrine inhibits monocyte entry into the brain of EcoHIV infected mice. Additionally we demonstrated that buprenorphine improves EcoHIV induced cognitive impairment in these animals. We will test the hypothesis that buprenorphine will inhibit CCL2 mediated mature monocyte transmigration across the BBB and associated CCR2 receptor signaling, and therefore will contribute to improved cognition in HIV infected opioid abusing as well as non drug using people as a result of decreased neuroinflammation and damage.","1891039 (contact); 1871302; ","BERMAN, JOAN WEINBERGER (contact); VOLSKY, DAVID J;","KHALSA, JAGJITSINGH H.","04/15/2017","02/28/2022","abstracting; Adhesions; Agonist; AIDS Dementia Complex; Animals; antiretroviral therapy; base; Biology; Blood - brain barrier anatomy; Brain; Brain Diseases; brain endothelial cell; Buprenorphine; CCL2 gene; CD14 gene; Cell Adhesion; Cells; Characteristics; chemokine; Chemotaxis; Chronic; Clinical Research; Cognition; Cognitive deficits; cognitive function; Data; Dependency; Disease; DNA; Drug abuse; drug of abuse; Drug usage; Endothelium; FCGR3B gene; Functional disorder; Goals; health related quality of life; HIV; HIV Infections; HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder; Human; Impaired cognition; improved; In Vitro; in vitro Model; Individual; Inflammation; Inflammatory; injection drug use; kappa opioid receptors; Knockout Mice; Laboratories; Lead; Leukocytes; Life; Life Expectancy; macrophage; Mediating; Mental Health; Methadone; migration; Modeling; monocyte; monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 receptor; mouse model; Mus; neuroAIDS; Neurobiology; Neurocognitive Deficit; neuroinflammation; Neurologic; Neuropathogenesis; Neurovirology; New York City; non-drug; novel; Opiate Addiction; Opiates; Opioid; opioid abuse; Opioid Receptor; Opioid Rotation; Patients; peripheral blood; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phenotype; physical conditioning; Play; Population; preclinical study; Prevalence; Process; receptor; Receptor Signaling; Research; Risk Behaviors; Safety; Severities; System; Testing; Therapeutic; Time; Work; ","Effect of buprenorphine on monocytes in the context of neuroAids and opioid abuse","041931","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","01","568283","162676","730959",""

The IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (ISPCTN) represents a transformational opportunity to recruit more underserved children to participate in state-of-the-art clinical trials, facilitate implementation of well-designed pediatric clinical trials, and enhance pediatric clinical trial capacity within the IDeA state, Delaware (DE) at Nemours/Alfred I duPont Hospital for Children (AIDHC). The DE- Nemours/AIDHC site participation in the ISPCTN will catalyze new ideas, promote new collaborations, and will engage clinicians, researchers, and the community in well-designed pediatric clinical trials. Provision of this expertise and infrastructure will increase cutting edge clinical trial research with improved efficiencies for initiating and completing clinical trials and improved public health in DE and the nation.
