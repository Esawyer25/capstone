However, patients who achieve a complete pathologic response (pCR) after treatment with chemotherapy and radiation followed by esophagectomy often experience greatly improved survival. Unfortunately, the percentage of patients who currently achieve a pCR is low. The goal of this study is to understand the expression patterns and function of microRNAs in esophageal cancer cells. This will enable us to identify patients who are not likely to achieve a pCR with current regimens and to identify new therapeutic targets based on an analysis of microRNA expression and function in esophageal cancer cells. Because the incidence of esophageal cancer continues to increase in the U.S., especially in males over the age of 50, this disease represents a significant problem in the VA system. Improving outcomes for esophageal cancer patients will greatly improve the VA's ability to fulfill its healthcare mission.","10426447; ","DONAHUE, JAMES M;","","01/01/2017","12/31/2020","advanced disease; Aftercare; Age; alternative treatment; Apoptosis; base; Binding; Biological Markers; Biopsy; cancer cell; Cancer cell line; Cancer Patient; carcinogenesis; Caring; cell type; cellular engineering; Characteristics; chemotherapy; Clinical; Data; demographics; Development; diagnostic biomarker; differential expression; Disease; Down-Regulation; Ectopic Expression; Engineering; Epithelial Cells; Epithelium; Esophageal; Esophagectomy; Esophagus; Evaluation; Excision; experience; Gene Expression; Goals; Growth; Healthcare; Healthcare Systems; Human; Implant; improved; improved outcome; in vivo; Incidence; Individual; male; Malignant neoplasm of esophagus; Malignant Neoplasms; MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase; Messenger RNA; Methods; MicroRNAs; Mission; Modality; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; new therapeutic target; novel; Nude Mice; Oncogenes; Oncogenic; operation; Operative Surgical Procedures; Outcome; overexpression; Pathogenesis; Pathologic; Patients; Pattern; Postoperative Period; predictive marker; Problem Solving; prognostic; Prognostic Marker; Radiation; Regimen; response; Role; Sampling; Specimen; Surgeon; Surgical Management; Survival Rate; survivin; System; Techniques; Testing; Therapeutic; therapeutic target; Translations; Treatment Protocols; treatment strategy; tumor; Tumor Suppressor Proteins; Untranslated RNA; Work; ","Surgical Studies on the Role of MicroRNAs in Esophageal Cancer","001434","SURG","Surgery ","","A2","01","","","",""

An emerging area of p53 research has suggested a potential nuclear/transcriptional-independent function of p53 in the cytoplasm. The function and molecular mechanisms of p53 in mitotic control and in cytoplasm both remain elusive. We found that CUL7 and CUL9, two cytoplasmic localized E3 ubiquitin ligases that bind to p53, constitute an OBSL1-CUL7-CUL9-p53 pathway that functions to maintain microtubule and genome integrity, likely through a regulation p53 cytoplasmic function.

These cancers notoriously carry numerous genetic mutations that aid in both the development and progression of the disease. Two of the most common alterations in LUAD occur in the TP53 tumor suppressor and KRAS proto-oncogene. Although it is well established that alterations in these genes results in the development of LUAD, how this process occurs remains elusive. Using an unbiased approach, we have found that LUAD tumors upregulate a protein called KLF6, which functions to regulate the expression of other genes that inappropriately regulate cancer growth. The overall goals of this proposal are to determine whether KLF6 is required for cancer growth in LUAD, to identify how this is accomplished, and to block this process using clinically approved re-purposed pharmacological inhibitors.","10022645; ","MCKENNA, BRIAN ;","JAKOWLEW, SONIA B","02/01/2017","07/31/2018","Accounting; actionable mutation; Address; Adenocarcinoma Cell; Adjuvant Therapy; American; American Cancer Society; Anaplastic Lymphoma; Automobile Driving; base; Binding; Bioinformatics; Biological Assay; Biological Process; C2H2 Zinc Finger; cancer cell; Cancer cell line; Cancer Etiology; cancer type; Caring; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell Cycle Progression; Cell physiology; Cell Proliferation; Cessation of life; Chromatin Structure; Clinical; Colorectal Cancer; Databases; Development; Diagnosis; differential expression; Disease Progression; DNA Binding Domain; DNA Sequence Alteration; Exhibits; Family; Family member; Frequencies; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Regulation; gene product; Gene Targeting; Genes; Goals; Grant; Growth; Growth and Development function; Hot Spot; Human; Immunohistochemistry; improved; inhibitor/antagonist; KRAS2 gene; Large Cell Carcinoma; Leukocytes; Link; Lung; Lung Adenocarcinoma; Lung Neoplasms; Malignant neoplasm of lung; Malignant Neoplasms; member; Modeling; Mus; Mutate; Mutation; Neoplasm Metastasis; never smoker; Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma; Oncogenic; Oncoproteins; outcome forecast; overexpression; paralogous gene; Pathogenesis; Patients; Probability; Process; Property; Protein Overexpression; Proteins; Proto-Oncogenes; Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases; Reporting; research study; response; Role; Sampling; Smoking; Squamous Cell; Staging; Stress; Survival Rate; Testing; The Cancer Genome Atlas; Therapeutic Intervention; TP53 gene; transcription factor; tumor; tumor growth; Tumor Markers; Tumor Suppressor Proteins; tumorigenic; United States; Zinc Fingers; ","KLF6: A driving factor of lung adenocarcinoma","213898","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","58766","","58766",""

Not only are Springfield residents 12- 65 percent more likely to be affected by these conditions than Massachusetts residents as a whole, but the city's Black and Latino residents are 20-65 percent more likely to be affected than their Black or Latino counterparts statewide (MDPH 2003-2007). It is well-established that regular adherence to prescribed medication can help reduce the incidence and impact of chronic disease, including stroke. Yet minority and low-income patients, in particular, face significant barriers in adhering o their medication regimens, making them less likely to benefit from available care. Study results have potential national significance, especially in the context of coming changes in the nation's health care system. As tens of millions of additional individuals gain insurance coverage, cost control measures such as formulary changes and copayment tiers will become increasingly common. The Affordable Care Act invests billions more in community health centers over the next decade, and it will become increasingly important to identify effective strategies to improve medication adherence which can be integrated into those clinics where so many of those at highest risk for obesity and chronic illness receive care. Increasing our understanding of cultural factors, including cultural health beliefs, and their relationship to medication adherence among patients with low health literacy, holds significant promise for efforts to reduce disproportionate stroke risk and mortality among minority and low- income populations.","7026861; ","SHAW, SUSAN J;","CAMPO, REBECCA ANN","01/01/2017","12/31/2017","abstracting; Address; Adherence; Affect; Affordable Care Act; African American; base; Belief; Budgets; Caring; Chronic; Chronic Disease; Cities; Clinic; Community Health Centers; Complex; Compliance behavior; Comprehension; copayment; cost; Cost Control; cost shifting; Coupled; Cross-Sectional Studies; Data; Diabetes Mellitus; diaries; Disease Management; Dyslipidemias; Equilibrium; Ethnic group; ethnographic method; Ethnography; experience; Face; Food; Formularies; Funding; Grant; Health; health belief; health disparity; Health Insurance; health literacy; Health Personnel; Health Status; Healthcare; Healthcare Systems; Heart Diseases; high risk; Hispanics; Home environment; Hypertension; Immigrant; improved; Incidence; Individual; Informed Consent; inner city; Instruction; Insurance; Insurance Coverage; Interview; Investigation; Laboratories; Language; Latino; Link; literacy; Literature; Low income; Low Income Population; Manuals; Massachusetts; Measures; medication compliance; Medicine; meetings; Methods; Minority; Modeling; mortality; Obesity; Outcome; Participant; Patient Education; Patient Self-Report; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; pill; Play; Policies; Population; Population Heterogeneity; Poverty; Primary Health Care; programs; Provider; Qualitative Methods; Quality of life; Readability; Recommendation; Recruitment Activity; Regimen; Reporting; Research; Research Personnel; Risk; Role; Sampling; Self Management; Severity of illness; Shapes; Site; skills; social; Social support; Socioeconomic Factors; socioeconomics; stroke; Stroke prevention; Surveys; Transportation; United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality; United States National Institutes of Health; ","Medication Adherence, Health Literacy and Health Beliefs in a Massachusetts Community Health Center","120907","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","04","317753","45700","363453",""

Abnormal neural crest development is responsible for the high incidence of congenital craniofacial abnormalities and peripheral nervous system defects (neurocristopathies). Moreover, neural crest cells and their derivatives can escape growth control and become tumors, including melanomas and neuroblastomas. Therefore, an understanding of neural crest cell fate determination and the identification of genetic regulators that direct cell growth versus differentiation may allow us to develop strategies to overcome human developmental disorders and to uncover cellular targets for cancer therapy.","14259369; ","MARK, KEVIN ;","MAAS, STEFAN ","09/01/2016","08/31/2019","Affect; Area; Biochemical Pathway; Biogenesis; Biological; Biological Process; Cell Differentiation process; Cell Fate Control; cell growth; Cell Lineage; Cell physiology; cell type; Cells; cellular targeting; Cephalic; Chondrocytes; Complex; Connective Tissue; Craniofacial Abnormalities; craniofacial development; CRISPR screen; CRISPR/Cas technology; CUL3 gene; Data; Defect; Deubiquitination; Development; developmental disease/disorder; Disease model; Dissection; DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase; drug discovery; Embryonic Development; embryonic stem cell; enzyme substrate; Enzymes; Forcible intercourse; Foundations; Ganglia; Gene Chips; Gene Components; Gene Expression; Gene Targeting; Generations; Genes; Genetic; genetic regulatory protein; Goals; Growth; Human; human disease; human embryonic stem cell; In Vitro; Incidence; Investigation; Knowledge; Laboratories; Lead; Learning; Libraries; Maintenance; Malignant Neoplasms; Mammalian Cell; man; melanocyte; melanoma; Messenger RNA; Modeling; Monoubiquitination; Multipotent Stem Cells; neoplastic cell; Neural Crest; Neural Crest Cell; Neuroblastoma; novel; Organism; Osteoblasts; Output; Pathway interactions; Peripheral Nervous System; Phosphorylation; Play; Population; Post-Translational Protein Processing; prevent; Process; Production; progenitor; programs; Proliferating; Proteins; Regenerative Medicine; relating to nervous system; Ribosomes; Role; scaffold; self-renewal; Signal Pathway; Site-Directed Mutagenesis; stem cell differentiation; stem cell population; Stem cells; System; targeted cancer therapy; targeted treatment; Technology; Therapeutic Agents; Time; Tissues; tool; Transcription Coactivator; Translations; tumor; Tumor-Derived; Ubiquitin; ubiquitin ligase; Ubiquitination; vertebrate embryos; Work; Xenopus; ","Role of Ubiquitination in Neurocristopathies and Neural Crest-Derived Cancers","120956","","","","S1","01","1800","","1800",""

Kidney regeneration is poor following acute kidney injury and there are no treatments available at this time to directly encourage regeneration.

Our approach to elucidate this novel signaling event relevant to the function of a well-characterized tumor suppressor, PP2A, can help guide the development of future PP2A targeted therapies.","14442555; ","PERL, ABBEY ;","KORCZAK, JEANNETTE F","02/17/2017","02/16/2019","Activation Analysis; Apoptosis; Attention; Attenuated; Automobile Driving; base; Binding; Binding Proteins; Biological; Biological Models; cancer cell; Cancer Patient; cancer therapy; Catalytic Domain; Cell Death; Cells; Clinical; Complex; Contracts; Data; Dependence; Development; dimer; Event; Family; Family member; Future; Growth; Holoenzymes; Human; in vivo Model; Individual; Induction of Apoptosis; inhibitor/antagonist; insight; knock-down; KRAS2 gene; Laboratories; loss of function; Malignant neoplasm of lung; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; Molecular Conformation; Mus; mutant; novel; Oncogenic; Oncogenic Viruses; oncology; overexpression; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases; Phosphorylation; Phosphotransferases; Play; Protein Dephosphorylation; Protein phosphatase; protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunit 65 kDa; Protein Phosphatase 2A Regulatory Subunit PR53; research study; Resistance; response; Role; scaffold; Series; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Signaling Protein; Simian virus 40; Site; small molecule; Small T Antigen; Substrate Specificity; success; targeted cancer therapy; targeted treatment; Testing; Therapeutic; Transgenic Model; tumor; tumor growth; Tumor Suppressor Proteins; Work; Xenograft Model; Xenograft procedure; ","Defining the role of the PR72 regulatory subunit in small molecule mediated activation of PP2A's tumor suppressive activity","213554","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","37176","","37176",""

However, the same immunosuppressive medications that are required to prevent the child's immune system from attacking and rejecting the transplanted organ, can predispose children to developing a very serious cancer that is linked to the Epstein Barr virus (EBV). Diagnosis and effective treatment of the EBV-associated cancer is hampered by our inability to determine which children are at risk of developing these cancers and to detect the cancer at an early stage. In this proposal we plan to test new 'biomarkers' in the blood of children that will tell us very early on if the child is at risk of developing the EBV-associated cancer or if the cancer is present. These studies provide new opportunities for detection, diagnosis, and treatment of children with EBV- associated post-transplant cancer.","2070661; ","ESQUIVEL, CARLOS O;","ODIM, JONAH ","02/01/2013","01/31/2018","Accounting; Address; Adverse effects; allograft rejection; Antiviral Agents; Antiviral Therapy; B-Lymphocytes; Biological Markers; biomarker development; Blood; cell free DNA; Cells; chemotherapy; Child; Childhood; Chronic; Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia; Clinical; Clonality; Coupled; Data; Detection; Development; Diagnosis; Disease; disorder risk; Early Intervention; effective intervention; effective therapy; end stage disease; Epstein-Barr Virus Infections; Future; gain of function mutation; Genes; Goals; Graft Rejection; Health; Heart; high risk; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Human Herpesvirus 4; Immune response; Immune system; Immunocompromised Host; Immunosuppressive Agents; Infant; infected B cell; Infection; Intervention; Intestines; Kidney; Link; Liver; LMP1; Lymphoma; Lymphoproliferative Disorders; Malignant Neoplasms; MicroRNAs; Molecular; mortality; Mutation; Natural immunosuppression; Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma; novel; novel marker; Observational Study; Oncogenes; Organ; Organ Transplantation; outcome forecast; Patients; Pattern; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Population; pre-clinical; prevent; programs; Reporting; Residual Neoplasm; Risk; Role; screening; Signal Transduction; Small Intestines; Solid; Staging; success; Surrogate Markers; symposium; Symptoms; T cell response; T-Cell Receptor; T-Cell Receptor Genes; T-Lymphocyte; Testing; Therapeutic; Time; Transplant Recipients; Transplantation; treatment choice; United States National Institutes of Health; Vaccines; Viral Genome; Viral Proteins; Virus Diseases; virus related cancer; ","Biomarkers for Post-Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorders in Children","104342","ZAI1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","05","956015","407534","1363549",""

This project is designed to improve AML cure rates by understanding how Arhgap25 functions in leukemia development so that new medicines can be developed to specifically target leukemia stem cells as part of combination therapy for AML.","10110739; ","WANG, LEO D;","LIM, SUSAN E","02/20/2017","01/31/2022","abstracting; Actins; Acute Myelocytic Leukemia; Address; Advisory Committees; Area; Award; base; Biochemical; Biochemistry; Boston; Cancer Biology; career; career development; Cell Line; Cell physiology; Cell Survival; cell transformation; Cells; chemotherapy; Child; Chimeric Proteins; Clinical; combinatorial; Combined Modality Therapy; Conceptions; CXCL12 gene; CXCR4 gene; Dana-Farber Cancer Institute; Data; design; Development; Development Plans; Diabetes Mellitus; differential expression; Differentiation and Growth; Disease; Ensure; Environment; Event; experience; Family; Funding; Future; Genomics; Goals; Grant; Growth and Development function; GTPase-Activating Proteins; Guanosine Triphosphate; Hematological Disease; Hematopoiesis; Hematopoietic; Hematopoietic stem cells; HOXA9 gene; Human; Hydrolysis; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; inhibitor/antagonist; insight; Institutes; Investigation; Kinetics; Laboratories; leukemia; leukemogenesis; Maintenance; Malignant - descriptor; Malignant Neoplasms; Mass Spectrum Analysis; Measures; Mediating; Medicine; Mentors; Mentorship; MLL-AF9; Modeling; molecular targeted therapies; Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins; Mus; mutant; Myelogenous; Myeloid Leukemia; Myelopoiesis; Nature; novel; novel therapeutics; NUP98 gene; Oncogenes; Oncogenic; oncology; Outcome; Pathway interactions; Pediatric Hematology; Pediatric Hospitals; phosphoproteomics; Phosphorylation; Physicians; Population; Post-Translational Protein Processing; progenitor; programs; Protein Dephosphorylation; protein function; Proteins; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Publications; Relapse; relapse patients; Research; Research Personnel; Research Proposals; research study; Research Training; Resistance; retroviral transduction; rho; Role; RUNX1 gene; Scientist; Serine; Signal Transduction; Sorting - Cell Movement; stem; stem cell biology; Stem Cell Leukemia; stem cell therapy; Stem cell transplant; Stem cells; Structure; System; Techniques; tenure track; Tertiary Protein Structure; Testing; Time; Training; Transplantation; United States National Institutes of Health; Universities; Work; ","Targeting the ARHGAP25 pathway in acute myelogenous leukemia stem cells","201591","NCI","Subcommittee I - Transistion to Independence ","","A1","01","157000","12560","169560",""

It is caused by the expression of a toxic RNA from the mutant DM1 gene. Progressive muscle wasting and weakness are a hallmark of DM1 and cause significant morbidity and adversely affect the quality of life for patients with DM1. Muscle maintenance and regeneration is critically dependent upon muscle stem cells (known as satellite cells). Though this is a crucial component of muscle, very little is known about the effects of RNA toxicity on satellite cells or their ability to repair muscle in the context of RNA toxicity. Currently, there are no mouse models of RNA toxicity in satellite cells. We have developed new mouse models of RNA toxicity, as well as new mouse models to study the satellite cell niche in the context of RNA toxicity. Our goal is to use these models to characterize and understand the effects of the toxic RNA on these cells and the process of muscle regeneration in order to provide a better understanding of muscular dystrophy in DM1, and to develop novel mouse models and techniques which can be used to study the effects of new therapies on muscle regeneration and the satellite cells niche.","3054679; ","MAHADEVAN, MANI SUBRAMANIAM;","CHEEVER, THOMAS ","02/20/2017","12/31/2021","3' Untranslated Regions; Address; Adult; adverse outcome; Affect; Antibodies; Antisense Oligonucleotides; Caliber; Cell Count; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell Nucleus; Cell physiology; Cells; Child; Collaborations; Defect; Direct Lytic Factors; Embryo; Event; Family; Fatigue; Genes; Goals; Grant; Hand Strength; Histopathology; Immunofluorescence Immunologic; improved; in vivo; Knockout Mice; Knowledge; Maintenance; Measures; Mediator of activation protein; Modeling; Morbidity - disease rate; mouse model; Mus; Muscle; Muscle Fatigue; Muscle function; muscle regeneration; Muscle satellite cell; Muscle Weakness; Muscular Atrophy; Muscular Dystrophies; mutant; Myoblasts; Myogenin; Myotonia; Myotonic Dystrophy; Natural regeneration; novel; novel therapeutics; overexpression; Patients; Pharmacologic Substance; Process; Proteins; Quality of life; receptor; regenerative; Regenerative response; repaired; Reporting; research study; response; RNA; RNA Splicing; RNA-Binding Proteins; Role; satellite cell; self-renewal; Skeletal Muscle; success; Symptoms; Tamoxifen; targeted treatment; Techniques; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Effect; therapy development; Time; Tomatoes; Toxic effect; Transcript; Transgenes; Translating; Untranslated Regions; wasting; Work; ","RNA Toxicity and Muscle Regeneration","071170","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","245908","146930","392838",""

Under normal conditions HDL protects against atherosclerosis via reverse cholesterol transport and potent antioxidant/anti-inflammatory properties (HDL function). It is well established that ESRD is associated with HDL deficiency. In addition, we and other investigators have shown decreased HDL function in patients with ESRD. Recent studies have shown that HDL from patients with ESRD can actually promote inflammation thereby contributing to atherogenesis. Hence, it is no surprise that in patients with ESRD, elevated serum levels of HDL are not always associated with a reduced risk of mortality. These paradoxical findings underscore the need for future studies which focus on deciphering the role of HDL function rather than level in CV mortality. Furthermore, novel signaling pathways need to be identified which can determine HDL function thereby providing prognostic as well as therapeutic tools for future exploration. One novel and promising area which has not been explored to date, is the role of lipid-derived mediators such as endocannabinoids, fatty acid ethanolamides and ceramides in HDL function in ESRD. There is an abundance of evidence implicating these molecules in inflammation, ApolipoproteinA-I/HDL deficiency and CV disease. Therefore, these pathways are promising candidates for evaluation in ESRD. The goal of the applicant is to become an independent translational research investigator. Hence the main training objective of this CDA proposal is to provide him with experience and expertise in clinical and translational research while expanding his knowledge in pathophysiology of lipid-derived mediators. The scientific objectives of this career development award project are four fold. First, to evaluate the role of HDL function in determining the risk of CV and all-cause mortality in patients with ESRD. Second, to determine whether novel lipid-derived mediators can help determine HDL function and mortality. Third, determine the impact of age, gender, race and ethnicity on these measurements. Fourth, in-vitro studies will be performed to evaluate possible utility of FAEs in improving ApoA-I level and HDL function. The proposed application is the first clinical study in a large cohort of dialysis patients which evaluates the role of HDL function in te CV and all cause mortality associated with ESRD. In addition, this is the first clinical study to date that evaluates the association of lipid-derived mediators with HDL dysfunction and CV mortality. Therefore, the findings from this project have a significant potential for identifying prospective new targets for future examination and therapy. To conduct this study, we will be using the serum samples, laboratory and clinical data available from the MADRAD study, a NIDDK-sponsored prospective data-collection study, supported by a K24 and resources of Dr. Kalantar-Zadeh, who is a co-mentor on this application. This CDA project will be conducted in a supportive multi-disciplinary environment with a group of mentors who are renowned experts in different aspects of this proposal. The mentorship and comprehensive training program proposed in this application are designed to build on the training and expertise that the applicant has acquired so far in his career. Furthermore, several future studies based on this novel and promising proposal have been identified which build on the role of HDL function and lipid-derived mediators in CV mortality of the Veterans to be submitted as VA Merit Awards.

Here we propose investigation of selective small molecule inhibitors and activators of G protein ?? subunits identified in our laboratory which could be used to inhibit multiple GPCRs and modify actions of existing GPCR directed pharmaceuticals. Results of these experiments will help to validate this alternate approach to modification of signaling pathways downstream of GPCRs that could ultimately lead to development of novel therapeutics.","1872191; ","SMRCKA, ALAN V.;","DUNSMORE, SARAH ","04/01/2008","07/31/2020","","Selective Targeting of G Protein beta gamma Subunits with Small Molecules","081772","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","10","186258","102332","288590",""

Rodent models of Alzheimer's disease also produce impairments in spatial navigation (e.g., Attar et al., 2013, Liu et al., 2013, Marlattet al., 2013) and these impairments may involve abnormal communication between the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and hippocampus during behavior and during rest related memory replay (Jacobs et al., 2012, Morbelli et al., 2012, Irish et al., 2013, Rowley et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2013). Therefore, using current techniques for functional dissection of brain circuits, I will explore the relationship between changes in the parietal-hippocampal network and navigation/memory impairments in animal models as a first step towards furthering our understanding of Alzheimer's disease.","9347075; ","WILBER, AARON A;","YANG, AUSTIN JYAN-YU","04/15/2015","03/31/2017","3xTg-AD mouse; Age; Alzheimer's Disease; Amyloidosis; Animal Model; Animals; base; Behavior; Brain; Cells; Code; Communication; Disease; Dissection; Environment; Episodic memory; Exhibits; experience; familial Alzheimer disease; Genes; Head; Health; Hippocampal Formation; Hippocampus (Brain); Human; Impairment; indexing; Individual; Injection of therapeutic agent; insight; Knowledge; Learning; Ligands; Limbic System; Link; Location; Maps; Measures; Memory; memory consolidation; Memory impairment; Modeling; mouse model; Movement; Mus; Neocortex; Neurofibrillary Tangles; neuromechanism; novel; Parietal; Parietal Lobe; Pathology; Patients; Pattern; Pharmacogenetics; Play; Population; Positioning Attribute; receptor; Research; research study; Rest; Rodent Model; Role; Series; Societies; spatial memory; spatiotemporal; Speed; Symptoms; Synapses; System; Techniques; Testing; theories; Time; Transgenic Mice; Transgenic Model; Update; way finding; ","Parietal-hippocampal network in the triple transgenic mouse model of Alzheimers","049090","NIA","Neuroscience of Aging Review Committee ","","","03","86688","6935","93623",""
