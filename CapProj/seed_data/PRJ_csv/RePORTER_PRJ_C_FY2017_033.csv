This study will investigate 1) whether hypothyroidism magnifies the risk of coronary heart disease and mortality in patients with varying degrees of impaired kidney function, and 2) the role of thyroid hormone treatment in reducing hypothyroid-related death risk in chronic kidney disease, which will advance our understanding of whether hypothyroidism is a novel, modifiable risk factor for adverse cardiovascular outcomes in this vulnerable population.","10595774; ","RHEE, CONNIE MEEYOUNG;","RANKIN, TRACY L","07/01/2014","04/30/2019","Address; Atherosclerosis; Biological Assay; Biometry; Biostatistical Methods; California; Cardiac; Cardiovascular Diseases; cardiovascular health; cardiovascular risk factor; Cardiovascular system; career; career development; Cessation of life; Chronic Kidney Failure; Classification; Clinical; Clinical Research; Clinical Sciences; cohort; Comorbidity; comparative effectiveness; Complement; Complication; coronary artery calcification; Coronary heart disease; Data; Databases; Development Plans; Diagnosis; Diagnostic; Diagnostic Imaging; Dialysis patients; Dialysis procedure; Diet; digital; Endocrine; Endocrinology; endothelial dysfunction; Environment; Epidemiologic Methods; Epidemiologist; Epidemiology; epidemiology study; Evaluation; Event; experience; follow-up; Foundations; Functional disorder; Future; General Population; Goals; Gold; Health; heart disease risk; Heart failure; Hemodialysis; High Prevalence; Home environment; hormone deficiency; Hospitals; Human Subject Research; Hypothyroidism; imaging modality; Impaired Renal Function; improved; Inflammation; Inflammatory; innovation; insight; Institutes; Interdisciplinary Study; Kidney Diseases; Laboratories; Link; Los Angeles; Malnutrition; Measures; Medicare; Medicine; Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award; Mentors; Mentorship; Methods; modifiable risk; Monitor; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Multicenter Studies; multidisciplinary; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases; Nephrology; novel; Nutritional; Outcome; P-Selectin; patient oriented; patient oriented research; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Platelet Activation; Population; Productivity; professor; prognostic; Property; prospective; Prospective cohort; Proteins; Publishing; racial disparity; Renal function; Research; Research Design; Research Personnel; Resources; Risk; Risk Factors; Role; Scanning; Staging; statistics; structural heart disease; Structural Models; Surrogate Endpoint; Techniques; Therapeutic Index; Thrombosis; Thyroid Function Tests; Thyroid Gland; Thyroid Hormones; Thyrotropin; Thyroxine; Time; Translational Research; Triiodothyronine; Universities; Uremia; Veterans; Vulnerable Populations; wasting; Woman; X-Ray Computed Tomography; ","Hypothyroidism, Cardiovascular Health, and Survival in Kidney Disease","102903","DDK","Kidney, Urologic and Hematologic Diseases D Subcommittee ","","","04","185850","14749","200599",""

Even the most promising immunotherapies are effective for a limited range of cancers and only for a minority of patients (e.g. response rates with PD-1 inhibitors are ~25-40%). Moreover, they can be associated with significant toxicities, and tumors ? especially solid tumors ? eventually develop resistance. This project aims to develop a novel immunotherapy for the treatment of melanoma, and potentially a wide array of tumors to ultimately provide profound anti-tumor immunotherapeutic benefits in a wide variety of cancer indications, particularly those characterized by a weakened immune system that do not respond to other immunotherapies.","1888855; ","GUYRE, PAUL ;","HALLETT, KORY L","05/12/2017","04/30/2019","absorption; Adoptive Cell Transfers; Adoptive Transfer; Animals; Antigen Presentation; Autopsy; B-Lymphocytes; Biological Assay; Biological Markers; biomarker identification; cancer cell; cancer immunotherapy; Cancer Patient; Cells; chimeric antigen receptor; Clinical; Clinical Trials; Clonal Expansion; commercialization; cytokine; Cytolysis; Data; Development; Dose; effective therapy; efficacy study; Electrocardiogram; Evaluation; Excretory function; experimental study; Fermentation; flasks; Goals; Grant; granulysin; Granzyme; Guidelines; Human; human subject; Immune; Immune Checkpoint; Immune response; Immune system; immunogenicity; Immunotherapeutic agent; Immunotherapy; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; inhibitor/antagonist; Injection of therapeutic agent; Interferon Type II; Interleukin-2; Interleukin-6; Investigational Drugs; Investigational New Drug Application; Killings; Malignant Neoplasms; Maximum Tolerated Dose; Mediating; meetings; melanoma; Melanoma Cell; Metabolism; Minority; Modeling; Monitor; mouse model; Mus; neoplastic cell; novel; Organ; partial response; Pathology; Patients; Phase; Phenotype; preclinical development; preclinical safety; Preparation; Process; Production; programs; Proliferating; Property; Proteins; Protocols documentation; Research; Resistance development; response; Rodent; Safety; safety study; Small Business Innovation Research Grant; Solid Neoplasm; System; T cell response; T-Lymphocyte; Testing; Toxic effect; Toxicology; tumor; tumor growth; tumor microenvironment; Xenograft procedure; Yeasts; ","Development of GIFT4: a B cell focused immunotherapy for cancer","217365","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","","","999088",""

This work seeks to improve these outcomes by establishing a mechanistic understanding of the neuron-Toxoplasma interaction.","9485990; ","KOSHY, ANITA ;","WONG, MAY ","04/01/2016","02/28/2021","Address; Affect; Anatomy; Anti-inflammatory; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Area; base; Biomedical Engineering; Brain; Cell Communication; Cell physiology; cell type; Cells; Cellular biology; Central Nervous System Diseases; Central Nervous System Infections; Cessation of life; Clinical; Cognitive; Complex; congenital infection; Custom; Data; data modeling; Disease; Disease Outcome; Engineering; experience; Fetus; Fibroblasts; Foundations; Genetic Recombination; Genotype; Goals; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Human; human disease; Image; Imaging Techniques; Immune; immune function; Immune response; Immunocompetent; Immunocompromised Host; Immunohistochemistry; improved outcome; In Vitro; in vivo; Inbred Mouse; Infection; Injection of therapeutic agent; insight; Knowledge; laser capture microdissection; Link; Location; Mediating; Microbe; Modeling; Molecular; motor deficit; mouse model; Mus; Nature; Neurologic; Neurological outcome; Neurons; novel; Organelles; Outcome; Parasites; Pathway interactions; Population; prevent; programs; Proteins; public health relevance; recombinase; Research; rhoptry; Secondary to; Techniques; Testing; therapy development; Thick; Toxoplasma; Toxoplasma gondii; Toxoplasmosis; transcriptome sequencing; Tropism; Vision; Work; ","Defining neuron-Toxoplasma gondii interactions that mediate CNS toxoplasmosis","095994","CNBT","Clinical Neuroimmunology and Brain Tumors Study Section ","","S1","02","43439","17156","60595",""

Elderly patients comprise half the CKD population and are particularly vulnerable to loss of muscle mass, strength and function - changes common in CKD that lead to increased morbidity and mortality. Studies in maintenance hemodialysis patients show that regular exercise can counteract the loss of muscle mass and function and is low cost. However, most studies have not specifically targeted the elderly and have involved small numbers or lacked controls; in addition, little is known regarding the actual wasting process. The primary aim of this study is to develop an effective 'user- friendly' home-based exercise program that counteracts wasting and loss of muscle function that occurs in elderly dialysis patients. Our second aim is to better understand the processes causing muscle wasting in CKD. Our third aim is to test whether the response to exercise can be enhanced with nutrient supplementation.","8318553 (contact); 1874096; ","MYERS, JONATHAN N.

It has been difficult to model deficits in social attachment behaviors that occur in mental illness because traditional model systems lack these complex behaviors as adults, but if the prairie vole becomes tractable to reverse genetic approaches, it may well become the model organism of choice for studying the effects of psychiatric conditions on social attachments. We propose to develop genetic tools in the prairie vole to model social attachment deficits that result from mutations in genes associated with autism and schizophrenia will not only galvanize basic science research into the poorly understood phenomenon of social attachment, but it is also likely to be of utility in understanding and treating mental illnesses in humans.","10925915; ","MANOLI, DEVANAND SADANAND;","DESMOND, NANCY L","04/01/2016","03/31/2020","Adult; Ally; Animal Model; Ankyrin Repeat; autism spectrum disorder; Autistic Disorder; base; Basic Science; Behavior; Biological Models; blastocyst; Brain; Cells; clinically relevant; Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats; Complex; Development; Disease; Drosophila genus; Embryo; Embryo Transfer; embryonic stem cell; Employee Strikes; Employment; endophenotype; Exhibits; fascinate; Female; Friendships; Gene Targeting; Generations; Genes; Genetic; genetic analysis; genetic approach; Genetic Models; Harvest; Health; Heritability; Hormones; Human; Injection of therapeutic agent; insight; knockout gene; Life; loss of function; Mammals; Mediator of activation protein; Mental disorders; Messenger RNA; Microinjections; Microtus; Modeling; Molecular; Molecular Genetics; Mood Disorders; Moods; Mus; mutant; Mutation; neural circuit; Neurobiology; neuromechanism; neuronal patterning; Neurons; Neuropeptides; neuropsychiatric disorder; neuroregulation; offspring; Other Genetics; OXT gene; Oxytocin; Pair Bond; Palmitoylated Membrane Protein 2; Parent-Child Relations; Partner in relationship; Patients; Pattern; Personality Disorders; Phosphorylation; Play; prairie vole; Primates; Protocols documentation; Research; Resistance; reverse genetics; Ribosomes; Rodent; Role; Rupture; Schizophrenia; Separation Anxiety; Signal Transduction; social; social attachment; Social Behavior; social model; social organization; social skills; Social support; stem cell technology; Symptoms; Techniques; Technology; Testing; Therapeutic; Time; tool; Ursidae Family; Vasopressins; Work; Zebrafish; zygote; ","Genetic models for social attachment deficits in psychiatric illness","107754","PMDA","Pathophysiological Basis of Mental Disorders and Addictions Study Section ","","","02","170492","13639","184131",""

Most of the rare variants involved in complex human diseases have moderate effects, which makes it necessary to analyze large sample sizes. Technology advances such as the use of social media and consumer directed genetics have greatly empowered researchers to quickly recruit study participants with interesting phenotypes. Thanks to the decreasing cost of sequencing and microarray genotyping, there is an unprecedented opportunity to assess the impact of rare variants in these ever-growing reservoir of sequenced/genotyped samples, and understand the genetic architecture of rare variants. Meta-analyses have been a powerful tool to aggregate genotype-phenotype association information from multiple cohorts.  Compared to methods that require pooling individual level data, meta-analyses better protect study participant privacy, more robust against heterogeneity between studies, and offer equal power for detecting associations.  In many settings, meta-analysis is the only potential solution where sharing individual level information is impossible.        In the sequencing age, meta-analyses warrant additional development, in order to accommodate the much increased scale of the datasets, enable more accurate assessment of statistical significance for analyzing low frequency variants, and allow for more robust association analyses. In Aim 1, we will develop novel methods to enable more accurate meta-analyses of low frequency variants extending ideas from Firth and Bartlett correction. In Aim 2, we will develop more scalable methods to meta-analyze low frequency variants, borrowing strength from large reference panels e.g. from the Haplotype Reference Consortium. In Aim 3, we will develop methods to accommodate sequence data heterogeneities and enable more robust meta-analyses. In Aim 4, we will develop methods that enable the global assessment of genetic architectures, allowing more accurate enrichment analyses and tissue specific analyses. For all methods arising from this proposal, we will provide useful softwares implementing these methods, continuing our strong track record in this direction (Aim 5). To achieve our research goals, we assembled a strong research team, consisting of not only method developers, but also geneticists leading big, high profile studies. Methods and tools from this proposal will be applied to some of the largest datasets in the world for studying nicotine and alcohol dependence, lipid levels, heart disease and macular degenerations.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rare variants have established functional roles in a variety of human complex disease with significant public health relevance, including type II diabetes, age-related macular degenerations and coronary artery diseases etc. With decreasing cost of sequencing, there is an unprecedented opportunity to understand complex traits genetic architectures in ever-increasing reservoirs of sequenced or genotyped samples. Our proposed methodology will greatly facilitate the meta-analysis of sequence data and address the challenges for modeling genetic architectures of complex traits.","11763406; ","LIU, DAJIANG ;","BROOKS, LISA ","05/16/2016","04/30/2020","Address; Age; Age related macular degeneration; Alcohol dependence; Architecture; base; Cardiovascular Diseases; Categories; Chromosome Mapping; cohort; Complex; Complex Genetic Trait; Computer software; Coronary Arteriosclerosis; cost; Data; Data Quality; Data Set; design; Development; Disclosure; Disease; empowered; Etiology; experimental study; Frequencies; Functional disorder; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Models; Genetic study; genome sequencing; Genomics; Genotype; Goals; Haplotypes; Heart Diseases; Heterogeneity; Human; human disease; improved; Individual; insight; interest; Investigation; Joints; Knowledge; Lead; Linkage Disequilibrium; Lipids; Macular degeneration; Meta-Analysis; Methodology; Methods; Modeling; next generation; next generation sequencing; Nicotine Dependence; Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; novel; open source; Participant; Phenotype; Privacy; Public Health; public health relevance; Quality Control; rare variant; Recruitment Activity; Research; Research Personnel; Role; Sample Size; Sampling; Sampling Studies; Signal Transduction; simulation; social media; Software Tools; statistics; Study Subject; success; Technology; Testing; therapeutic target; Time; Tissues; tool; trait; user friendly software; Variant; whole genome; ","Method to Enhance the Rare Variant Genetic Architecture Analysis in Meta-Analyses","008983","BDMA","Biodata Management and Analysis Study Section ","","","02","256224","91446","347670",""

This work addresses the high priority of next generation HIV therapies with better safety and ease of use, developing and testing HIV treatments that are less toxic, longer acting, have fewer side effects and complications, and easier to take and adhere to than current regimens. In this way, the proposed technology meets NIH?s mission to treat immune-mediated diseases, to develop new and more-effective treatments for HIV-infected people, and to find a cure. Specifically, the technology supports the Trans-NIH Plan for HIV Research to: ? Accelerate the discovery and validation of strategies, targeting new and existing viral and cellular  targets that provide safe, tolerable, maximally long-term suppressive antiviral activity. ? ? Advance the discovery and validation of therapeutic strategies to prevent progression of HIV and its  associated comorbidities, including inflammation, coinfections, and other clinical complications across  the lifespan of HIV-infected individuals. ? Support research on the mechanisms of HIV persistence and develop strategies to prevent the  establishment of, decrease, or eliminate viral reservoirs that persist despite optimal antiretroviral (ARV) treatment. ? Develop and evaluate methods, tools, and intervention strategies that improve entry into, and retention  in, HIV care. ? Develop and test strategies to improve adherence to ARV drug regimens and regimens to prevent and  treat HIV-associated comorbidities used for treatment and prevention in domestic and international settings. Additionally, the proposed technology meets both NIDA?s and NIMH?s Division of AIDS Research priorities to minimize neurotoxicities induced by long-term use of antiretroviral therapy by potentially reducing daily adherence requirements of cART, toward eradication of the virus from HIV-infected individuals to achieve a functional cure.","12336574; 9044000 (contact); 1873230; ","BOLTON, DIANE L.; KAY, HEIDI A (contact); RAPPAPORT, JAY ;","STOFF, DAVID M.","08/17/2012","04/30/2019","abstracting; Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Address; Adherence; Adverse effects; Adverse event; Affect; Aftercare; Analysis of Variance; Animal Model; Anti-Retroviral Agents; antiretroviral therapy; Antiviral Agents; Award; Blood; Blood Cells; Bone Marrow; Businesses; Cardiovascular Diseases; Caring; cellular targeting; Cerebrospinal Fluid; Chronic; Clinical; clinical biomarkers; Clinical Chemistry; clinical practice; Clinical Trials; co-infection; Comorbidity; Complete Blood Count; Complex; Data; design; Development; Disease; Dose; drug development; Economics; effective therapy; efficacy testing; experience; Family Felidae; Feline Immunodeficiency Virus; Felis catus; Flow Cytometry; Funding; gene therapy; Genetic Transcription; Head; Health; Healthcare Systems; Heart; Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy; HIV-1; Human; Immune; Immune response; Immune System and Related Disorders; Immunologics; Immunology; immunotoxicity; improved; In Vitro; in vitro Model; in vivo; Individual; Infection; Inflammation; International; Interruption; Intervention; Killings; Latent Virus; Legal patent; Lentivirus Infections; Longevity; Macaca mulatta; man; Measures; Mediating; medication compliance; meetings; Methods; micronucleus; Military Personnel; Mission; Modeling; Monitor; National Institute of Drug Abuse; National Institute of Mental Health; Neuraxis; neurocognitive disorder; Neurology; neurotoxicity; neutralizing antibody; next generation; nonhuman primate; novel therapeutic intervention; Nucleocapsid; Nucleocapsid Proteins; Outcome; Pathogenesis; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase; Physiological; pill; Plasma; preclinical safety; Preclinical Testing; prevent; Prevention; Production; programs; Proviruses; purge; Quality of life; Regimen; Research; Research Priority; Research Support; Risk; Rodent; Safety; safety testing; Science; Shock; simian human immunodeficiency virus; SIV; skills; Small Business Innovation Research Grant; small molecule; social; Source; Study models; Subfamily lentivirinae; Technology; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Intervention; therapeutic target; therapy adherence; Tissues; tool; Toxic effect; Translating; Treatment Efficacy; United States National Institutes of Health; Universities; Urinalysis; Validation; Viral; Viral Genome; Viral load measurement; viral rebound; Viral reservoir; Viremia; virology; Virus; Virus Diseases; Virus Replication; Whole Blood; Withdrawal; Withholding Treatment; Work; Zinc Fingers; ","Safety and Efficacy Testing of FX101 in an SIV/NHP Model","096663","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","03","","","1154643",""

Reactivation of a fetal form of hemoglobin (HbF) greatly ameliorates the consequences of the hemoglobin diseases. The work proposed in this application directly addresses how HbF is normally silenced in development by a specific protein known as BCL11A.

Our goal here is to determine the regenerative potential of these cells in a mouse of LGMD2I (FKRPP448L), apply this technology to iPS cells obtained from patients with FKRP mutations, to establish methods to correct the FKRP mutation, and to determine the therapeutic potential of these cells following their transplantation into recipient FKRPP448L mice.

We aim to use these tools so that we can generate models that inform us of how CLL first develops and how it becomes more aggressive; availability of these new mouse models is expected to teach us about the critical steps in cancer development and progression and to provide a path towards the rational testing and use of novel therapeutics.","9880427; 6089518 (contact); ","WANG, LILI ; WU, CATHERINE JU-YING (contact);","JHAPPAN, CHAMELLI ","05/11/2017","04/30/2022","Acceleration; actionable mutation; Adoption; Affect; Age-Months; aged; Aging; Animal Model; ATM Gene Mutation; B lymphoid malignancy; B-Lymphocytes; base; Blood; cancer cell; cancer gene expression; CD19 gene; Cell Line; Cells; Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia; Clinical; clinical practice; Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats; cohort; combinatorial; Data; del(11q); Development; Disease; Disease model; Disease Progression; DNA Damage; Educational process of instructing; Engraftment; Evaluation; Event; exome; Experimental Models; Foundations; gain of function; gain of function mutation; Gene Mutation; Gene-Modified; Genetic; Genetic Heterogeneity; genetic makeup; genome editing; genome sequencing; genomic data; Goals; Hereditary Disease; Histology; Human; human disease; Human Genetics; In Vitro; in vivo; Individual; individual patient; Indolent; insight; Investigation; knock-down; Knock-in Mouse; Knowledge; Lead; lentiviral-mediated; Lesion; leukemia; Lymphoma; Malignant Neoplasms; Marrow; Mature B-Lymphocyte; Medicine; Methylation; Modeling; Molecular; Monitor; mouse development; mouse model; Mus; Mutate; Mutation; network models; novel; novel therapeutics; Oncogenic; Onset of illness; overexpression; Patients; Penetrance; personalized therapeutic; Phase; Positron-Emission Tomography; precision medicine; Preclinical Testing; pressure; programs; Progressive Disease; Reporting; Resources; response; RNA Splicing; Role; Sampling; Spleen; Stem cells; Subgroup; Techniques; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Agents; therapeutic evaluation; Time; tool; transcriptome sequencing; Vision; whole genome; Work; ","(PQ8) Genetically faithful murine models for studying disease progression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia","216273","ZCA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","446376","245719","692095",""

Together, this proposal will provide insight into molecular bases of FHC and a dual cardioskeletal myopathy caused by mutated MLC2ventr/slow.","7689388; ","SZCZESNA-CORDARY, DANUTA ;","SCHRAMM, CHARLENE A.","07/06/2015","04/30/2019","3' Splice Site; Address; Affect; Age of Onset; Age-Months; Applications Grants; Arginine; Aspartic Acid; base; Benign; Binding Sites; Birth; Cardiac; Cardiac Death; Cardiomyopathies; Cessation of life; Complement; Death, Sudden, Cardiac; design; Disease; disease phenotype; DNA; Electron Microscopy; Event; experience; experimental study; Familial Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy; Family; Fiber; Foundations; Functional disorder; Genes; Genetic study; Glutamic Acid; Glutamine; Goals; Head; Heart; Heart Abnormalities; Heart failure; Heart Ventricle; Histopathology; Human; Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy; in vivo; Induced Mutation; infancy; Infant; insight; Kinetics; Label; Link; Liquid Chromatography; Lysine; Malignant - descriptor; Measurement; Measures; Molecular; mouse model; Mus; Muscle; Muscle Contraction; Muscle Fibers; mutant; Mutate; Mutation; Myocardial dysfunction; Myocardium; Myopathy; Myosin ATPase; Myosin Heavy Chains; Myosin Light Chain Kinase; Myosin Regulatory Light Chains; N-terminal; Nonsense Codon; novel; Papillary; papillary muscle; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pattern; Phenotype; Phosphorylation; Point Mutation; premature; Preparation; Proteomics; public health relevance; Recombinant Proteins; reconstitution; Regulation; Reporting; retinal rods; Risk; RNA Splicing; Sarcomeres; Severities; Signal Pathway; Site; skeletal; Skeletal Muscle; Skeletal Muscle Myosins; Skin; Soleus Muscle; Splice-Site Mutation; Symptoms; tandem mass spectrometry; Time; tool; Transgenic Mice; Transgenic Organisms; Troponin; Valine; Variant; X ray diffraction analysis; X-Ray Diffraction; ","Novel cardioskeletal myopathy associated with MYL2","123255","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","03","350144","148700","498844",""

Factors that contribute to difficult T2DM management in CKD may include low patient adherence, and conservative provider prescription decision-making, resulting from lack of long-term data on potential benefits and harms of certain medications over others in CKD as well as from little clinical experience with newer drugs.

Recently, in animal models of pain, we have shown that relief of pain depends on opioid neurotransmission in these brain areas. The changes in endogenous opioid mechanisms in chronic pain may therefore reduce the efficacy of opioid analgesics and may lead to the progressive development of affective and depressive symptoms characteristic for chronic pain. This project will evaluate changes in cortical opioid expression and function over a six months period following induction of neuropathic pain, to preclinically mimic chronic pain states in patients. We will investigate whether brain opioid changes are causally linked to pain, whether there is a time relationship to pain chronicity and development of comorbid symptoms and whether brain changes, once established, are reversible with treatment of pain.","1864475 (contact); 1875261; ","PORRECA, FRANK  (contact); WANG, ZAIJIE JIM;","PUROHIT, VISHNUDUTT ","04/15/2016","01/31/2021","Ablation; Acute; Acute Pain; Address; Adsorption; Affective; Affective Symptoms; Analgesics; Animal Model; animal pain; Animals; Anxiety; Area; associated symptom; awake; Behavior; Behavioral; Binding; Binding Proteins; Biological Markers; Biological Preservation; Brain; Brain region; Characteristics; chronic neuropathic pain; chronic pain; cingulate cortex; Clinical; Clinical Trials; Comorbidity; Coupled; Cytotoxin; Decision Making; depressive behavior; depressive symptoms; desensitization; Detection; Development; Disease; Dopamine; Drug usage; Effectiveness; Emotional; emotional symptom; Endogenous Opiates; Etiology; experience; Functional disorder; gabapentin; GTP-Binding Proteins; Health; hedonic; Human; Impairment; in vivo; Injury; Investigation; Knowledge; Laboratories; Lead; Learning; Link; Longitudinal Studies; Measurement; Measures; Mental Depression; Messenger RNA; Methods; Microdialysis; Modeling; Modification; Morphine; Motivation; Negative Reinforcements; neurochemistry; neuroimaging; Neurons; Neuropeptides; neurotransmission; Neurotransmitters; Nociception; novel; Nucleus Accumbens; Opioid; Opioid Analgesics; Opioid Peptide; Opioid Receptor; Outcome; Output; Pain; Pain management; painful neuropathy; Patient Self-Report; Patients; Positron-Emission Tomography; Predisposition; preference; protein expression; radioligand; radiotracer; Rattus; receptor binding; receptor function; Recovery; Reporting; Resiniferatoxin; Resolution; response; Rewards; Role; Scanning; Signal Transduction; Speed; Substance P; Substance P Receptor; success; Symptoms; System; Techniques; Therapeutic; Time; Translations; treatment response; Ventral Striatum; ","Cortical opioid dysfunction in chronic pain","041809","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","S1","02","7755","620","8375",""

Addressing this disparity is of critical importance and motivates NIDA to enhance its science education resources for minority early career scientists to increase their success with NIH applications. This program provides training to early-stage research scientists from underrepresented groups or disadvantaged backgrounds, aiming to increase the number of racial/ethnic minorities who lead culturally relevant behavioral or pharmacological treatment research; the goal is to produce multidisciplinary research leaders and strengthen the network of research and training for NIDA and its partnering organizations.","1892921 (contact); 1888427; ","MASSON, CARMEN L.

CHI in particular is often caused by folding defects in the KATP channel, causing excess insulin secretion.

To achieve this, we are studying host interactions with Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague. Plague is a rapidly progressing lethal infection that is facilitated by the mammalian innate immune response. Our research has discovered a novel pathway for activating expression of type I IFN that contributes to the progression of plague. We hypothesize that inhibition of this pathway could be a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of pneumonic plague as well as other bacterial diseases.","1875273; ","ANDERSON, DEBORAH M;","MUKHOPADHYAY, SUMAN ","05/08/2017","04/30/2022","Acute; Adaptor Signaling Protein; Aerosols; Antibiotic Therapy; Antiviral Response; Bacteria; Bacterial Infections; Breathing; Bubonic Plague; Cells; Clinical; Communicable Diseases; cytokine; Data; Development; Disease; Disease Progression; Dose; Effector Cell; Eukaryotic Cell; Event; Family; Generations; Genes; Goals; Gram-Negative Bacteria; Growth; Human; human disease; Immune; Immune response; Immunity; Infection; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Inflammatory Response; Innate Immune Response; Interferon Type I; Interferons; Investigation; IRF3 gene; Laboratories; Lead; Life Cycle Stages; Lung; macrophage; Mediating; member; microbial; Modeling; Molecular; mortality; mouse model; Mus; neutrophil; novel; novel therapeutics; Onset of illness; pandemic disease; pathogen; Pathogenesis; Pathologic; Pathway interactions; Patients; Phagocytes; Plague; Pneumonia; Pneumonic Plague; Population; programs; Receptor Signaling; Recruitment Activity; Refractory; Regulation; Reporting; Research; respiratory; response; Role; Route; Sepsis; Septicemic plague; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Southwestern United States; Specificity; symptom treatment; Symptoms; Systemic disease; Systemic infection; targeted treatment; Testing; therapeutic target; Tissues; TLR7 gene; Toll-like receptors; transcription factor; treatment effect; treatment strategy; vector; Vector-transmitted infectious disease; Virulence; Virulence Factors; Work; Yersinia pestis; ","Host Response and Immunity to Yersenia pestis Infection","129996","HIBP","Host Interactions with Bacterial Pathogens Study Section ","","A1","01","250000","123364","373364",""

We have evidence of a role for Meth-induced ROS in regulating CCR5 expression in a dopamine-independent fashion, and we have identified an ability of HIV Tat to upregulate TATA-box binding elements, which are regulatory components that can interfere with the expression of 10% of genes with expression high variability, such as chemokines, chemokine receptors, and several early response inflammatory genes. We will investigate whether ROS-induced transcription factors in the presence of Meth are modulated by a TATA-box based mechanism triggered by HIV Tat, altering the phenotype of glial cells towards a higher expression of CCR5 and RANTES, exacerbating the inflammatory milieu and promoting viral replication: these are potentially novel modes of regulation of molecules such as CCR5 in the context of drugs of abuse and HIV, relevant for immune function in the brain, and open an original translational perspective for understanding the susceptibility to inflammatory neuropathology in amphetamine users.","9436441; ","MARCONDES, MARIA CECILIA GARIBALDI;","POLLOCK, JONATHAN D","04/01/2017","03/31/2018","Address; Affect; Amphetamine Users; Astrocytes; base; Behavior; Binding; Binding Sites; Blood - brain barrier anatomy; Brain; brain cell; CCR5 gene; Cell Line; Cells; Characteristics; chemokine; chemokine receptor; Coculture Techniques; CREB1 gene; Data; Disease Progression; Dopamine; Dose; drug of abuse; Elements; Equilibrium; Generations; Genes; Genetic Transcription; glial activation; Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein; Health; high risk behavior; HIV; HIV Infections; HIV-1; Immune; immune function; immunocytochemistry; In Vitro; in vivo; Infection; Infiltration; Inflammatory; inflammatory marker; inflammatory milieu; inflammatory modulation; Inflammatory Response; Investigation; Macaca; macrophage; Mediating; Methamphetamine; methamphetamine abuse; methamphetamine use; Microglia; Mus; Neuraxis; neuroAIDS; Neuroglia; Neurons; neuropathology; novel; Nuclear Translocation; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Peptides; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phenotype; Phosphorylation; Play; Population; Predisposition; Process; promoter; RANTES; Reactive Oxygen Species; Regulation; Regulatory Element; Role; Signal Induction; Signal Transduction; SIV; Small Interfering RNA; Symptoms; System; TATA Box; transcription factor; Transcription Factor AP-1; Transgenic Mice; Up-Regulation; Ursidae Family; Viral Load result; Virus; Virus Replication; Western Blotting; ","Methamphetamine and HIV interactions in the regulation of glial activation","036164","ZDA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","S1","05","7840","627","8467",""

Treatment options for advanced PCa, including androgen-ablation therapy, radiation and surgery, do not offer a cure but delay the inevitable recurrence of the lethal advanced hormone-refractory disease. Chemotherapy using the cytotoxic drug docetaxel, and the FDA-approved novel taxane drug Cabazitaxel, and a Cyp17 inhibitor drug against androgen synthesis Zytiga (abiraterone acetate) for recurrent CRPCa in patients who fail docetaxel regimen only adds an expected prolongation of survival of 2-4 months. All these treatments have significant side effects that negatively affect the quality of life of the patients and the new drugs are prohibitive expensive. Chemoprevention is key to winning the war on cancer by blocking, inhibiting, and reversing genetic and epigenetic oncogenic events in early stages of carcinogenesis. Selenium (Se) has been thought to hold great promise as a chemopreventive agent. However, the negative efficacy outcomes of recently concluded human trials with seleno-methionine (inactive form compared to Se forms to be evaluated in this proposal) have caused many to conclude that there is no hope for using other or any Se forms to prevent PCa. Our proposal, if successfully accomplished, will fundamentally redefine and even change the mechanism paradigms and provide solid rationale for choice of active and safe Se form for human translations, and resurrect and advance the field of Se-(prostate) cancer chemoprevention research.","1866783; ","LU, JUNXUAN ;","PERLOFF, MARJORIE ","04/01/2013","03/31/2019","abiraterone; Ablation; abstracting; Acetates; Adverse effects; Affect; American; American Association of Cancer Research; American Cancer Society; Androgens; Apoptosis; base; cancer chemoprevention; cancer diagnosis; Cancer Etiology; cancer prevention; cancer risk; carcinogenesis; Cell Aging; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell Cycle Arrest; Cell physiology; Cells; cellular targeting; Cessation of life; Chemicals; Chemoprevention; Chemopreventive Agent; chemotherapy; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials; Cytotoxic agent; Data; Dietary intake; docetaxel; Double-Blind Method; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group; Epigenetic Process; Epithelial; Equilibrium; Etiology; Event; FDA approved; Goals; Growth; Health; Hormonal; Hormones; Human; in vivo; inhibitor/antagonist; Institution; Intake; Knock-out; Knockout Mice; Knowledge; Lesion; Mainstreaming; male; Malignant neoplasm of lung; Malignant neoplasm of prostate; Malignant Neoplasms; Marshal; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; meetings; men; Methionine; methylselenic acid; Mind; Modeling; Molecular Target; mouse model; Mus; Mutation; neoplastic; next generation; North America; novel; novel therapeutics; Nutritional; Oncogenic; Oncoproteins; Oral; Organ; Outcome; Paper; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Placebo Control; pre-clinical; Pre-Clinical Model; preclinical efficacy; preclinical study; prevent; Prevention; Preventive; Prostate; prostate cancer model; prostate cancer prevention; prostate carcinogenesis; Prostate carcinoma; Prostatic; Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasias; Proteins; proteomic signature; Proteomics; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Quality of life; Radiosurgery; Randomized; Rattus; Recurrence; Refractory Disease; Regimen; Research; Research Personnel; Resectable; reverse genetics; Rodent Model; Selenium; selenomethylselenocysteine; senescence; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Site; Solid; Southwest Oncology Group; Staging; statistics; taxane; Testing; Time; TP53 gene; transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate; Transgenic Organisms; Translations; Uncertainty; Validation; Vitamin E; War; Work; Yeasts; ","PREVENTION OF PROSTATE CARCINOGENESIS BY NEXT-GENERATION SELENIUM","172169","CDP","Chemo/Dietary Prevention Study Section ","","","05","58805","32166","90971",""

To further complicate the injury, combat personnel have likely been exposed to repeated blast concussions which could lead to the long- term sequelae. Data on chronic outcomes are lacking and are required to most effectively provide rehabilitation strategies catering to the individual stage of injury and neurodegeneration progression. There is a critical need for understanding the chronic and debilitating impairments in cognition, psychological health, and sensorimotor abilities. With the large number of Veterans reported to have TBI, it is vital to study of the long-term effects of TBI and identify neurodegeneration biomarkers of chronic injury following single or multiple exposures to trauma.","7943501; ","VANDEVORD, PAMELA J.;","","05/01/2015","04/30/2019","2',3'-Cyclic-Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases; Acute; Animals; Anxiety; base; Behavior assessment; Behavioral; Behavioral Mechanisms; Biological; Biological Markers; Biomedical Engineering; Blast Cell; Blast Injuries; Brain; Brain Concussion; Brain Injuries; Chronic; Clinical; Cognition; Cognitive deficits; combat; companion diagnostics; Conflict (Psychology); Data; Diagnosis; Diagnostic; Etiology; Event; Experimental Models; Exposure to; Functional disorder; Goals; Human Resources; Impaired cognition; Impairment; improved; improved functioning; Individual; Injury; interdisciplinary approach; Laboratories; Lead; Long-Term Effects; Measures; Memory Loss; Mental Health; Methods; mild traumatic brain injury; Military Personnel; Mission; Modeling; Molecular; Motivation; Multiple Trauma; Nerve Degeneration; Nervous System Trauma; Neurocognitive; Neurodegenerative Disorders; Neurologic; Neurological outcome; neuropathology; Neurosciences; Outcome; Pathology; Patients; Pattern; public health relevance; Qualifying; Recording of previous events; Recovery; rehabilitation strategy; Rehabilitation therapy; Reporting; Research; Research Design; response; Risk; Rodent; Rodent Model; Serum; Staging; Stress; symptomatology; Symptoms; Techniques; Testing; Time; Trauma; Traumatic Brain Injury; Veterans; War; ","Evaluating Causative Effects of Single/Multiple Neurotrauma on Neurodegeneration","001499","RRDB","Brain Injury ","","","03","","","",""

(a manifestation of big data in biomedical imaging): Modern imaging systems generate enormous data, far exceeding human abilities for interpretation, but what is paramount are not the images themselves, rather the clinically relevant information contained within the images; therefore, our long-term goal is to develop and validate comprehensive, high-performance computational tools that automatically and quantitatively extract clinically relevant information from images to support clinical decision making and facilitate precision medicine. To demonstrate the immediate, measurable impact of our research, we have chosen pulmonary embolism as our initial research platform because the Surgeon General has declared pulmonary embolism a major national health problem, causing more deaths than breast cancer, AIDS, and motor vehicle accidents combined; with laudable efforts to diagnose pulmonary embolism, the number of CT studies for suspected pulmonary embolism has been increasing dramatically, while incorrect CT interpretations are frequent in general practice (10-14% over/under-diagnosis); therefore, there is a clinical need to (1) mitigate radiologists? workloads and (2) improve the efficiency and accuracy for pulmonary embolism diagnosis using CT. Our objective is to address this clinical need by exploiting radiologist-computer synergy, delivering two important outcomes: (a) a new methodology that transcends the current paradigm from mere detection of emboli to simultaneous patient-level diagnosis, embolus-level detection, and over-diagnosis prevention; and (b) a next-generation, high- performance system that will be able to assist radiologists in quickly excluding negative patients without overlooking positive patients, accurately localizing individual emboli to support personalized treatments through risk stratification, and actively preventing PE over-diagnosis, exerting an important positive impact on clinical practice associated with pulmonary embolism?a life-threatening condition.","9887399; ","LIANG, JIANMING ;","XIAO, LEI ","07/01/2016","04/30/2020","abstracting; Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Address; Algorithms; Anatomy; Angiography; Area; Arteries; base; Big Data; bioimaging; Cessation of life; Clinical; clinical decision-making; clinical practice; Clinical Research; clinically relevant; Colon Carcinoma; Computer-Assisted Diagnosis; computerized tools; Computers; Data; Decision Support Systems; design; Detection; Development; Diagnosis; Diagnostic; Disease; Effectiveness; Embolism; Employee Strikes; Ensure; Equilibrium; experience; Explosion; Foundations; General Practices; Goals; Grant; Health; Health Care Costs; Human; Image; imaging study; imaging system; improved; Individual; innovation; Learning; Legal patent; Life; Literature; Lung; malignant breast neoplasm; Malignant neoplasm of lung; Measurable; Medical; Medical Education; Methodology; Methods; Modeling; next generation; novel; Organism; Outcome; Patient-Focused Outcomes; Patients; Peer Review; Performance; personalized medicine; Pilot Projects; precision medicine; prevent; Prevention; prototype; Publications; Pulmonary Embolism; radiologist; Research; research clinical testing; Research Personnel; Risk stratification; Sensitivity and Specificity; Social Impacts; Solid; success; Surgeon; System; Technology; Testing; tool; Traffic accidents; Training; Transcend; United States National Institutes of Health; Validation; vehicular accident; Veins; Visualization software; Workload; ","Computer-Aided Diagnosis of Pulmonary Embolism","128785","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","443442","231327","674769",""

It is well established that the normal form of p53 serves many functions to protect cells, animals and humans from acquiring tumors, thereby defining p53 as an important suppressor of tumor formation. Some of the mutated forms of p53 found in tumors serve the opposite function in that they actually promote cancerous behavior of cells. The basis for many of the experiments in this project are to determine how cancer related mutant forms of p53 stimulate expression of the mevalonate pathway by which cells make cholesterol and key byproducts, and how the normal wild-type form of p53 actually dampens this same pathway. Results from the planned experiments could refine treatment options for breast cancer patients and might also contribute to novel therapies for liver cancer patients for whom there are currently no effective treatments.","8019205; ","PRIVES, CAROL ;","","","","Ablation; Amino Acids; angiogenesis; Animals; ATP binding cassette transporter 1; base; Breast Cancer Cell; Breast Cancer cell line; Breast Cancer Patient; C-terminal; cancer cell; Cancer Patient; cancer therapy; Cancerous; cell behavior; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell Cycle; Cell Cycle Progression; Cell Death; cell motility; cell transformation; Cells; Cellular biology; Characteristics; Cholesterol; cholesterol transporters; chromatin modification; chromatin remodeling; Chromatin Remodeling Factor; coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1; Collaborations; Cytostatics; cytotoxic; Data; Dependency; deprivation; Development; effective therapy; Epidemiology; experimental study; Feedback; gain of function; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Regulation; gene product; Gene Targeting; Genes; Genetic Transcription; geranylgeranylation; Goals; Growth; Hot Spot; Human; inhibitor/antagonist; insight; isoprenoid; KDR gene; Laboratories; Lead; Learning; Ligands; Link; Liver neoplasms; Liver X Receptor; Malignant - descriptor; Malignant neoplasm of liver; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; member; Metabolic; mevalonate; Mevalonic Acid; Modification; Morphology; mouse model; Mus; mutant; Mutate; Mutation; novel; novel therapeutics; Nuclear; Oncogenic; Outcome; overexpression; Pathway interactions; Play; prevent; Primary carcinoma of the liver cells; programs; promoter; Property; Protein Geranylgeranylation; Protein p53; Protein Region; Proteins; receptor; Regulation; Regulatory Pathway; Repression; Role; senescence; Signal Transduction; Site; small hairpin RNA; SRE-2 binding protein; Sterols; Stress; Surface; Testing; three dimensional cell culture; TP53 gene; transcription factor; transcriptome sequencing; tumor; Tumor Suppressor Proteins; tumorigenesis; Variant; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors; Work; ","Project 1: Roles of wild-type and mutant forms of p53 in cancer cell biology","087497","ZCA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","5239","A1","16","211774","127064","","338838"

Chemicals to which GW veterans were exposed puts them at a higher risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases later in life. Brain imaging studies conducted on veterans with GWI compared to controls point to changes in the brain structures and networks that are involved in cognitive function. These studies provide compelling evidence that targeting the brain pathology in GWI will be bene?cial in treating GWI. Studies described in this proposal will identify therapies that target lipids associated with immune/in?ammation and mitochondrial and peroxisomal disruptions observed in GWI. Therapeutic targeting of these lipids may have the potential for improving the underlying brain pathology of GWI which can help improve the health of ill GW veterans so that they can integrate into community and perform normal activities of daily living.","10891956; ","ABDULLAH, LAILA ;","","04/01/2017","03/31/2020","abstracting; Activities of Daily Living; acylcarnitine; Affect; age related; age related neurodegeneration; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease; Arachidonic Acids; associated symptom; Astrocytes; Biochemical; Blood; Blood specimen; Brain; Brain imaging; Brain Pathology; brain pathway; branched chain fatty acid; Bromides; Cardiolipins; Chemical Exposure; Chemicals; Chronic; chronic pain; Clinic; Clinical; clinical practice; cognitive function; common symptom; Communities; Coupled; Data; Defect; Development; Docosahexaenoic Acids; effective therapy; Electron Transport; Ethers; Exhibits; Exposure to; Fatigue; Generations; Gulf War; Health; high risk; Hippocampus (Brain); imaging study; Immune; Impaired cognition; improved; in vivo; innovation; Institute of Medicine (U.S.); Institutes; Intervention; Investigation; Life; lipid metabolism; Lipids; long chain fatty acid; Mediator of activation protein; Memory; Memory impairment; Metabolic; Metabolism; Microglia; Mitochondria; mouse model; Mus; nerve agent; Nerve Degeneration; Neuraxis; neurobehavioral; Neurodegenerative Disorders; novel; Nuclear Receptors; oleoylethanolamide; Omega-3 Fatty Acids; oxidation; Oxidative Stress; Pain; Pain management; Parkinson Disease; Pathogenesis; Pathology; peroxisome; Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors; Persian Gulf; persistent symptom; Pesticides; Phospholipids; Poisons; Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids; pre-clinical; prevent; Process; programs; Proteomics; pyridostigmine; Quality of life; Regimen; Rehabilitation therapy; Reporting; Research; research study; Risk; Scientist; Series; Stable Isotope Labeling; Structure; Supplementation; Symptoms; targeted treatment; Testing; Therapeutic Intervention; therapeutic target; therapy development; Time; Translating; Translations; United States Food and Drug Administration; Very Long Chain Fatty Acid; Veterans; Work; ","Treating GWI immune and metabolic disturbances by targeting lipid metabolism","002260","RRD6","Blank ","","A1","01","","","",""

The Center for Systems Neurogenetics of Addiction (CSNA) takes on the pervasive challenge of identifying the biological relationships between the stages and patterns of cocaine addiction and behaviors that predict drug abuse, including impulsivity, reward seeking, adolescent nicotine exposure, acute drug response and circadian dysregulation. To uncover these relationships, we will make use of advanced mouse genetic tools that allow us to sample unprecedented genetic and behavioral diversity. These populations enable us to precisely and efficiently identify the genes related to addiction, and with more biological depth and less cost than human genetic studies. We will also make use of advances in a strategy called systems genetics that enables holistic study of genes, biological molecules and behaviors with advanced computational methods. We are working as a complementary team of investigators from several laboratories and institutions, each bringing deep experience and knowledge in the genetic studies of specific aspects of addiction in the laboratory mouse. Together we will test the hypothesis that each addiction risk factor involves a biological mechanism that is shared with drug taking and drug response, and that genetic variation in these biological pathways influences addiction. We will discover addiction-related genes and generate novel mouse models of addiction, data resources, educational offerings and research services that will enable other researchers to readily adopt our advanced tools, techniques and results. By doing this, our team and future investigators will be able to discover and develop new approaches for addiction prevention, early intervention and treatment that take into account the complexity of addiction risk and individual differences in genes, environment and behavior.","6675436; ","CHESLER, ELISSA J;","POLLOCK, JONATHAN D","08/15/2016","04/30/2021","Acute; addiction; Adolescent; Adopted; Affect; Awareness; base; Behavior; Behavioral; Behavioral Genetics; behavioral study; biobank; biobehavior; Bioinformatics; Biological; Biological Factors; Chromosome Mapping; Circadian Dysregulation; Circadian Rhythms; Cocaine; Cocaine Dependences; Collaborations; Communities; Complex; Computing Methodologies; Core Facility; cost; Data; Data Analyses; data resource; Data Set; Dependence; Deposition; Development; Diagnostic; Disease; Drug abuse; Drug Addiction; Drug Exposure; Drug usage; Early Intervention; Early treatment; Education; Environment; Exhibits; experience; Family; Fostering; functional genomics; Funding; Future; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Targeting; Genes; Genetic; genetic analysis; Genetic Crosses; Genetic study; genetic variant; Genetic Variation; genome editing; Genomics; Genotype; Goals; holistic approach; Human; Human Genetics; illicit drug use; Impulsivity; In Vitro; in vivo; in vivo Model; Individual; Individual Differences; Informatics; innovative technologies; insight; Institution; Intervention; Knowledge; Laboratories; Laboratory mice; Lead; Link; Maps; Methodology; Mission; model development; Modeling; Molecular Genetics; Molecular Profiling; mouse model; Mus; Mutant Strains Mice; Mutation; neurobehavioral; neurobiological mechanism; neurogenetics; Neurosciences Research; Nicotine; novel; novel strategies; Pathway interactions; Pattern; Pharmaceutical Preparations; phenomics; Phenotype; Population; Population Genetics; Population Heterogeneity; Predisposition; prevent; Prevention; Preventive measure; programs; psychostimulant; Public Health; Quantitative Trait Loci; relating to nervous system; Research; Research Activity; Research Personnel; Research Support; Resource Informatics; Resources; response; Rewards; Risk; Risk Factors; Sampling; Self Administration; Self-Administered; Services; sex; Source; Staging; stimulant abuse; Structure; Substance Use Disorder; symposium; System; Techniques; Testing; The Jackson Laboratory; Therapeutic; tool; Training; trait; Validation; Variant; Work; ","Center for Systems Neurogenetics of Addiction","039841","ZDA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","S1","02","18500","1480","19980",""
