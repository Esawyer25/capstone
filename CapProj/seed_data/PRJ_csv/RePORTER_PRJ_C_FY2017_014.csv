To gain insight into how vaccines induce protection of the most vulnerable, our project employs two novel approaches studying newborn responses to hepatitis B vaccine (HBV): (a) systems biology that uses technologies which comprehensively measure global changes in molecules such as transcriptomics (RNA) and proteomics (proteins), as well as cell composition of the blood and (b) use of human newborn blood components, collected prior to immunization, to model vaccine responses in vitro (outside the body). Characterizing vaccine-induced molecular patterns (?signatures?) that correspond to vaccine-mediated protection will accelerate development and optimization of vaccines against early life infections of major global health importance.","1928111; ","LEVY, OFER ;","PRABHUDAS, MERCY R.","12/27/2016","11/30/2021","Adult; Age; anti-hepatitis B; Antibodies; Antibody Response; Bioinformatics; Biological Assay; Biological Markers; biological systems; Birth; Blood; Blood Volume; Calmette-Guerin Bacillus; Cause of Death; Cells; Characteristics; Child; Clinical Research; cohort; Complement 3; Complex; Computer Simulation; Data; Detection; Developing Countries; Development; Dose; Enrollment; experience; functional status; Gambia; Gene Expression; Gene Proteins; Global Change; global health; Health Benefit; Hepatitis; Hepatitis B Surface Antigens; Hepatitis B Vaccination; Hepatitis B Vaccines; Human; Immune; Immune response; Immunization; Immunization Programs; immunogenicity; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; Infant; Infection; insight; Knowledge; Leukocytes; Life; Measures; Mediating; Modeling; Molecular; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Neonatal; neonatal hepatitis; Newborn Infant; novel; novel strategies; Output; Papua New Guinea; Pathway interactions; Pattern; peripheral blood; Phenotype; Plasma; Procedures; Process; protective efficacy; Proteins; Proteome; Proteomics; Public Health; response; RNA; sample collection; Sampling; Signal Transduction; Site; Surface Antigens; System; Systems Biology; Technology; Testing; Time; tool; Training; transcriptomics; Translating; Vaccination; vaccine development; vaccine response; vaccine-induced immunity; Vaccines; vaccinology; Validation; Variant; Whole Blood; Work; ","Systems Biology to Identify Biomarkers of Neonatal Vaccine Immunogenicity","118608","ZAI1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","01","1581169","447151","2028320",""

Because the Midwest is a national hotspot for disease emergence and endemic transmission of VBD, we will establish The Upper Midwestern Center of Excellence in Vector-borne Disease, a truly regional center covering Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, Michigan and Iowa. Center activities will focus the efforts of a formidable group of nationally-recognized public health entomologists, epidemiologists, virologists, public health experts, and vector control staff to improve outbreak and emergent disease management as well as current surveillance and control practices. The goals include development of systems and processes for sharing information between federal, state and local public health, vector control operations and academic partners, developing and increasing access to training opportunities for current vector control professionals, testing and improving the evidence base for current methods of vector management, and bringing innovative research in health information systems, optimization science, and diagnostic development to bear on these issues.

However, most patients with high IOP do not develop glaucoma, and up to half of patients with glaucoma have IOP in the normal range. The biomechanical properties of the eye may help explain this apparent discrepancy.

The goal of this research is to better define the cellular spectrum of fatty acid amides (the fatty acid amidome) found in vivo, to develop a platform strategy to characterize novel N-acyltransferases in vitro, to elaborate the contribution of the characterized N-acyltransferases to fatty acid amidome, and to dissect the divergent pathways of fatty acid amide metabolism.

If there is a benefit to doing an angiogram and treating with stents or surgery, then clinicians and patients must be made aware of these benefits and put them into practice to prevent bad outcomes like heart attacks and death; if the results show there is no benefit from routine invasive testing, then treatment would begin with only intensive lifestyle change and medication to control symptoms and reduce risk. Either finding could provide much-needed information to guide practice and improve quality of medical care.
