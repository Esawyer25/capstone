Pol II is responsible for transcribing the vast majority of genes t generate messenger RNA that will be translated in the ribosomes to produce all cellular proteins. The initiation stage of transcription requires timely interactions between Pol II and the general transcription factors (TFIIB, TBP, TFIIF, TFIIH and TFIIE). The process of initiation is highly dynamic; biochemical experiments hint at possible discrete stages where the GTFs recognize, melt and load a nucleic acid scaffold (NAS). This mechanism is universal, for all eukaryotic species, and is at the core of gene regulation; understanding its molecular details will provide essential clues that could potentially lead to pharmacological manipulation of gene expression.

Other disorders affecting these same areas outside V1 are associated with specific forms of visual loss such as akinetopsia (motion blindness) and agnosia (form blindness). Our research seeks to understand the organization and function of V2, the first and largest cortical visual area beyond area V1, both because of its potential as a substrate for visual loss and recovery after brain damage, and because it is a key part of the processing by which sensory signals are transformed to form decisions, guide actions, and create enduring memories of evanescent events.","1965976 (contact); 8928942; ","MOVSHON, J ANTHONY (contact); SIMONCELLI, EERO PETER;","FLANDERS, MARTHA C","03/01/2013","02/28/2018","Accounting; Affect; Agnosia; Ally; Animals; Architecture; Area; area MT; area striata; area V1; area V2; awake; Behavior; Behavioral; Biology; Blindness; blood oxygenation level dependent response; Brain Injuries; Cells; Data; design; disability; Disease; Dorsal; Electrophysiology (science); Elements; Event; experience; extrastriate visual cortex; Frequencies; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Goals; Health; Human; Image; Judgment; Link; Macaca; Measurement; Measures; Memory; Methods; Modeling; Motion; Motivation; Nervous system structure; neural circuit; neuronal circuitry; Neurons; Noise; novel; operation; orientation selectivity; Outcome; Output; Pattern; Perception; Performance; Population; predicting response; Primates; Probability; Process; Property; Psychometrics; Recovery; relating to nervous system; Research; research study; response; Role; Sensory; Signal Transduction; Space Perception; spatial integration; Staging; Stimulus; Stream; Structure; success; Techniques; Texture; tool; V1 neuron; V2 neuron; Vision; Vision Disorders; Visual; Visual Cortex; Visual Fields; Work; ","Visual pattern representation in extrastriate cortex","022428","SPC","Mechanisms of Sensory, Perceptual, and Cognitive Processes Study Section ","","","05","225000","124875","349875",""

These studies will identify new molecular targets that mediate chromatin looping and explore the effects of knock down of these cell looping components on EBV transformed lymphoblastoid cell gene expression.","1898934; ","KIEFF, ELLIOTT D;","DASCHNER, PHILLIP J.","03/15/2013","02/28/2018","Affect; Africa; African Burkitt's lymphoma; Antral; Asia; B Cell Proliferation; B-Cell Lymphomas; B-Lymphocytes; base; Binding; Binding Sites; Biochemical; burden of illness; Burkitt Lymphoma; c-myc Genes; C-terminal; CCND2 gene; cell growth; Cell Survival; Cells; chemotherapy; ChIP-seq; Chromatin; Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing; Chromatin Loop; cohesin; Complex; CSPG6 gene; Data; deep sequencing; Dependence; Disease; Distant; DNA; Dominant-Negative Mutation; EBNA2 protein; EBV-associated malignancy; Enhancers; Epithelial Cells; Epstein-Barr Virus Infections; Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Targeting; Genes; Genetic Transcription; Genome; genome-wide; Genomic approach; Genomics; Growth; Health; Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy; Histones; HIV; Hodgkin Disease; Human; Human Herpesvirus 4; Immune; Individual; Infection; Informatics; innovation; insight; knock-down; Laboratories; Lesion; lymphoblast; Lymphoma; Lymphoproliferative Disorders; Malignant - descriptor; Malignant Neoplasms; malignant stomach neoplasm; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; Membrane Proteins; Modeling; Molecular; Molecular Conformation; Molecular Target; mutant; notch protein; novel; Nuclear Proteins; Oral; Pathway interactions; programs; Proliferating; promoter; protein complex; Proteins; Reagent; recombinant virus; Recombinants; Research; research study; Rest; Role; Signal Transduction; Site; small hairpin RNA; Techniques; Time; Transcription Initiation Site; transcriptome sequencing; Virus; ","Roles of Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigens 2 and LP in B cell proliferation","170023","VIRA","Virology - A Study Section ","","","05","199350","154496","353846",""

Enteric infections have a significant impact on the health of populations in poorer settings, even in the absence of overt diarrhea. Although some infections of major importance can be prevented by vaccination, oral vaccines are insufficiently effective in resource-limited settings--exactly where they are most needed. This collaborative training program originally between Tufts University and Christian Medical College in Vellore, India is being expanded to include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta for additional training in epidemiology and vaccine impact monitoring and to the Baylor College of Medicine, Houston for training in virology and additional expertise in microbiome studies. In addition to expand the reach of the training program beyond a single Indian institution, the Indian program faculty will partner with the Department of Biotechnology's Clinica Development Service Agency in the development and implementation of the Indian Clinical Researcher Development (InCReD) program which plans to reach 15-20 young faculty at Indian medical schools in the first phase through a combination of credit based distance learning and in-person courses. The expected deliverables are therefore in two main categories, i) three levels of trainees who can contribute to the development of research programs and grow into independent investigators capable of leading research programs in India and ii) a course that supports the development of research skills among young faculty in medical schools across India.","7920320; ","KANG, GAGANDEEP ;","SINA, BARBARA J","08/15/2005","02/28/2021","Applications Grants; base; Bioinformatics; Biotechnology; career development; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.); Child; Clinical; Clinical Research; Clinical Services; cognitive development; college; Communicable Diseases; Developing Countries; Development; Discipline; disorder prevention; Distance Learning; Doctor's Degree; Enteral; Epidemiology; experience; Faculty; gastrointestinal infection; Goals; Government; Growth; gut microbiome; Immune response; Immunization; Immunology; India; Infection; Infectious Diseases Research; Intervention; Knowledge; Medical center; medical schools; Medicine; meetings; Mentors; Metagenomics; Morbidity - disease rate; Neonatal Mortality; oral vaccine; Paper; Performance; Postdoctoral Fellow; pre-doctoral; Program Development; programs; Public Health; Public Health Practice; Publications; Research; Research Personnel; Research Project Grants; Research Training; Resources; response; Risk Assessment; Role; skills; Training; training aid; Training Programs; translational approach; Translational Research; Universities; vaccinology; Work; ","Building enteric infectious disease research capacity in India","007392","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","12","215334","17227","232561",""

Using the Nurses' Health Study and the Black Women's Health Study cohorts, with rich data on dietary, lifestyle, psychosocial factors, and banked blood samples, we will examine whether and how these exposures at different time periods of life may alter SLE risk among white and black women of a range of socioeconomic backgrounds, shedding light on the biologic mechanisms of this complex disease and its disparities, and informing lifestyle interventions for SLE prevention.","2052802; ","COSTENBADER, KAREN H;","SERRATE-SZTEIN, SUSANA ","03/23/2017","02/28/2019","Accounting; Adolescence; Adult; Age; Alcohol consumption; American; Anti-inflammatory; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Antinuclear Antibodies; Anxiety; Area; Attention; Autoantibodies; Autoimmunity; Behavioral; Biological Markers; Biometry; Blood specimen; Body fat; Clinical; Cohort Studies; Collection; Complex; Consumption; cytokine; Data; depressive symptoms; Development; Diet; Dietary Factors; Dietary Practices; Disadvantaged; Disease; disparity reduction; End stage renal failure; Enrollment; Environmental Exposure; Epidemiology; experience; Exposure to; fast food; Fishes; Genetic; Grant; Health; health care quality; High Prevalence; Hormone use; Incidence; Inflammation; Inflammatory; innovation; Insurance; Intake; Life; Life Experience; Life Style; lifestyle factors; lifestyle intervention; Light; Link; Low income; low socioeconomic status; Lupus Nephritis; Mediating; Medicaid; Menarche; multidisciplinary; Nurses' Health Study; nutritional epidemiology; Obesity; Omega-3 Fatty Acids; Oral Contraceptives; Outcome; Patients; Pattern; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Play; Population; Population Attributable Risks; Postmenopause; Potato; Prevalence; prevent; Prevention; Processed Meats; Production; prospective; Prospective cohort; psychologic; Psychosocial Factor; Public Health; Race; Rheumatology; Risk; Role; saturated fat; Self Tolerance; Silicon Dioxide; Smoking; social; Socioeconomic Status; socioeconomics; soft drink; Staging; Stress; stressor; sugar; Systemic Lupus Erythematosus; Time; Tissues; Up-Regulation; Weight Gain; western diet; Woman; Women's Health; Work; ","Sociodemographic Disparities in SLE Incidence: Behavioral and Psychosocial Factors","057327","","","","S1","07","145734","112944","258678",""

This proposal uncovers a novel mechanism of auto- regulation of AR transcription wherein AR protein coordinates functionally with ACK1 tyrosine kinase to modify chromatin within the AR gene. Significantly, these data have exposed an Achilles' heel for targeting new treatment strategies in CRPCs. Our preliminary data indicates that reversal of these epigenetic marks by a novel ACK1 inhibitor (R)-9bMS, that we have developed, opens up a new therapeutic option for this essentially incurable malignancy. This proposal will perform detailed mechanistic & in vivo studies to test efficacy of (R)-9b as novel epigenetic inhibitors that suppress both AR and AR-V7 transcription overcoming CRPC tumor growth.","8554632; ","MAHAJAN, NUPAM P;","SATHYAMOORTHY, NEERAJA ","03/20/2017","02/28/2022","abiraterone; Ablation; absorption; abstracting; ACK1 Gene; Address; Androgen Antagonists; androgen deprivation therapy; Androgen Receptor; Androgens; anticancer research; ASH2L gene; Automobile Driving; base; C-terminal; Cancer Patient; candidate selection; castration resistant prostate cancer; Cells; ChIP-seq; Chromatin; Chromatin Remodeling Factor; Clinical; combat; Complex; Data; Dependence; Deposition; Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging; Disease; Disease Progression; DNA Polymerase II; Drug Kinetics; drug metabolism; Drug resistance; efficacy testing; Epigenetic Process; epigenetic regulation; Excretory function; Exhibits; Feedback; Gap Junctions; Gene Amplification; Gene Expression; Gene Targeting; Generations; Genetic; Genetic Transcription; genome-wide; Histone H4; histone methyltransferase; histone modification; Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase; Human; in vivo; inhibitor/antagonist; Investigational Drugs; Lead; Length; Ligand Binding Domain; LNCaP; male; Malignant - descriptor; Malignant neoplasm of prostate; Malignant Neoplasms; Messenger RNA; Metabolism; Metastatic Prostate Cancer; Methylation; Methyltransferase; MLL2 gene; Mono-S; mRNA Expression; Mus; mutant; Neoplasm Metastasis; neoplastic; novel; novel therapeutics; Nucleosomes; Oncogenes; overexpression; Pathogenesis; Phosphorylation; Play; Process; Production; programs; prostate cancer cell; prostate cancer model; Prostate Cancer therapy; Protein Tyrosine Kinase; Reader; receptor; Receptor Gene; Recruitment Activity; Recurrent disease; Regulation; Research Personnel; Resistance; response; RNA; RNA Splicing; Role; Signal Transduction; Site; small molecule inhibitor; Staging; Transcription Coactivator; Transcriptional Regulation; Translations; treatment strategy; tumor; tumor growth; tumor progression; tumor xenograft; Tyrosine; Variant; ","Targeting a Novel Epigenetic Signaling Nexus ACK1-pY88H4-AR/AR-V7 in Drug Resistant Metastatic Prostate Cancer","208258","BMCT","Basic Mechanisms  of Cancer Therapeutics Study Section ","","A1","01","215025","154818","369843",""

ESCoNS was founded and held its first highly successful meeting on September 19-20, 2011 at the UCSF Mission Bay Conference Center in San Francisco, CA. It attracted 221 attendees: cognitive and clinical scientists, clinicians, officials from the National Institute of Health and the Department of Defense, leaders of the videogame industry and the scientific media. In 21 talks given by world-leading scientists, two panel discussions, and over 50 scientific poster presentations, the consensus emerged that we now have the knowledge base to combine the neuroscience of brain plasticity and cognitive training with entertainment and interactive software technology to target brain dysfunction in a number of human illnesses, creating an innovative field of 'cognitive neurotherapeutics.' The purpose of ESCoNS 2 (and of ongoing ESCoNS meetings) is to leverage the expertise of scientific and software specialists for the design of these new approaches to cognitive training, as well as to surmount barriers in collaborative efforts and intervention implementation. Specific Aim 1: Speakers from the scientific community will address emerging knowledge on mechanisms of experience-dependent neuroplasticity and its alterations in neuropsychiatric disease, neurodegenerative disease, and normal aging; specialists in interactive and entertainment software from both academia and industry will share their knowledge of their craft and its potential applications to address impaired neural system functioning.

The long term survival rate for esophageal cancer is very poor. Therefore, biomarkers for early detection and prognosis as well as novel therapeutic options for treatment are urgently needed. Our research team has identified a protein, named Orai1 (after 'the Keeper of Heaven's gate in Greek mythology) that is strongly associated with esophageal tumor progression in both animal study and patients. We will study how it contributes to tumor initiation and progression. We will evaluate it as a potential biomarker for esophageal cancer detection and prognosis.

This has, in part, shifted the demographics of SCD to include a growing proportion of young adults with chronic health impairments. While hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has curative potential, very few individuals with SCD are treated by HCT, due in part to the toxicity of this treatment. Recently, advances in Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) typing techniques and supportive care have improved outcomes of HCT, particularly after unrelated donor HCT. We have organized an interdisciplinary group of transplant investigators and adult sickle cell providers as well as a data coordinating center very experienced in the conduct of clinical trials for the BMT clinical trials network to test whether HCT from an HLA-identical sibling or unrelated marrow donor is safe and effective in young adults with severe SCD with an at least 80% chance of being alive and free of sickle cell disease at two years after transplant. We have tested the feasibility of enrolling patients in the study and the safety of the conditioning regime in a pilot study of BMT in adults with SCD. We propose a clinical trial that it will compare outcomes after HCT to outcomes observed in those who receive standard supportive care, the first comparison of this kind in hemoglobin disorders. We will assign 60 patients age 15-40 years who have an available suitably matched donor to the BMT arm and will enroll 120-140 SCD patients who do not an available suitable donor to a parallel comparison cohort. We will compare outcomes the functional outcomes and sickle cell specific organ function in both groups at two years to learn the impact of HCT on SCD. We will also establish a long term follow up cohort of all eligible patients for the purpose of future studies of long term impact of HCT on outcome sin SCD. If successful, the proposed comparative clinical trial would be the first to compare HCT and supportive care for SCD, and could broaden the therapeutic opportunities for adults with severe SCD.","7745392 (contact); 1887557; ","KRISHNAMURTI, LAKSHMANAN  (contact); WALTERS, MARK C;","DI FRONZO, NANCY L.","03/03/2017","07/31/2020","Address; Adolescent and Young Adult; Adult; Age; Age-Years; Anemia; arm; base; Blood; Bone Marrow Transplantation; Cardiac; Cardiopulmonary; Caring; Child; Childhood; Chimerism; Chronic; chronic pain; Clinical; Clinical Trials; Clinical Trials Network; cohort; comparative; Comprehensive Health Care; conditioning; Conduct Clinical Trials; Consent; Data; Data Coordinating Center; demographics; Disease; Disease Progression; Disease-Free Survival; Donor Selection; electronic data; Eligibility Determination; Engraftment; Enrollment; Erythrocyte Transfusion; Event; experience; Feasibility Studies; follow-up; functional outcomes; Funding; Future; Grant; Health; health related quality of life; Healthcare; Hematopoiesis; hematopoietic cell transplantation; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Hemoglobin; Hemoglobinopathies; HLA Antigens; human leukocyte antigen testing; hydroxyurea; Image; Impairment; improved; improved outcome; Individual; Infection; Informed Consent; Inherited; innovation; Institutes; Kidney Failure; Learning; Life; Longitudinal Studies; Lung; Manuals; Marrow; Measures; Medical; Monitor; Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; Nature; Neonatal Screening; Neuraxis; operation; Organ; Outcome; Outcome Measure; Pain; Pain intensity; Patients; Pilot Projects; premature; Premature Mortality; prevent; primary outcome; Prophylactic treatment; Provider; pulmonary function; Pulmonary Hypertension; Quality of life; Recruitment Activity; reduce symptoms; Regimen; Renal function; Research Infrastructure; Research Personnel; Role; Safety; safety study; safety testing; secondary outcome; Selection Bias; Siblings; Sickle Cell; Sickle Cell Anemia; sickling; stroke; Supportive care; System; Techniques; Testing; Therapeutic; Toxic effect; Transplantation; trial comparing; young adult; ","Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation for Young Adults with Sickle Cell Disease - Clinical Coordinating Center","128566","","","","S1","02","59573","33361","92934",""

Furthermore, conservative estimates indicate that another 15,000 Americans suffer life-changing facial disfigurement annually. The combination of clinical need for vascularized complex allotransplants for these patients and increased surgical capabilities in hand, face and limb transplantation results in an ever-growing need for vascularized composite tissues. At the same time, the short current preservation times severely limit the number of these transplants that can be salvaged, constrain donor- recipient matching, and contribute to graft rejection in important ways. Our technology promises to overcome these issues by providing banks of vascularized complex allotransplants that can be provided to patients as needed with improved donor-recipient matching and graft outcomes.","1897660; ","TAYLOR, MICHAEL JOHN;","MINNICOZZI, MICHAEL ","04/15/2016","09/30/2017","Affect; Allografting; allotransplant; American; Amputation; Animals; animation; Antioxidants; Apoptosis Inhibitor; Autologous; base; Biological Preservation; Biomedical Engineering; Blood Circulation; body system; Body Temperature; cell bank; Cell Volumes; Cells; cellular engineering; Climacteric; Clinical; Collaborations; combinatorial; commercialization; Complex; conditioning; coping; cryogenics; Cryopreservation; design; Development; Device Designs; Devices; Digit structure; Engineering; Equilibrium; Evaluation; Exhibits; Face; facial transplantation; Freezing; Glucose; glucose analog; Goals; Graft Rejection; Growth; Hand; Health; holistic approach; Human; Hydrogen Sulfide; Ice; improved; in vitro Model; inhibitor/antagonist; Injection of therapeutic agent; Injury; Innovation Corps; Lead; Limb structure; limb transplantation; Medicine; Metabolic; metabolic depression; Metabolism; Methodology; Modeling; Molecular Weight; Muscle; Nature; next generation; Operative Surgical Procedures; Organ; Organ Preservation; Organ Survival; Outcome; Oxygen; Pathway interactions; Patients; Perfusion; Phase; Phospholipids; preconditioning; programs; Protocols documentation; Quality Control; Rana; repaired; Reperfusion Injury; Research; Resistance; response; Resuscitation; Rewarming; Skeletal Muscle; Stress; stress tolerance; stressor; success; Surgical Flaps; Technology; Temperature; Testing; Time; Tissue Banking; Tissue Banks; Tissue Engineering; Tissue Preservation; Tissues; tool; Translations; Transplantation; Trauma; Trehalose; Vascular Endothelial Cell; Wood material; ","Sylvatica I-Corps Commercialization Jan2017 - High Subzero, Equilibrium VCA Cryopreservation","124835","","","","S1","01","","","50000",""
