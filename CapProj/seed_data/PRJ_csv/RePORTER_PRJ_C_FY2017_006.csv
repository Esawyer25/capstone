The genetic causes of ALS have been linked to mutations in several genes, but the origins of sporadic ALS remains elusive. One clue to a potential environmental link to ALS came from our studies of the genes of the enzymes known as paraoxonases that detoxify insecticides and other agents and also protect certain fat particles in blood called HDL ('good' cholesterol containing particles) and LDL (bad cholesterol containing particles) from deleterious oxidation events. Specific genetic variants in the genes of these enzymes in SALS patients are associated with disease. We began studies of these proteins in blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Paraoxonase levels are higher in the plasma of SALS patients compared to controls suggesting there are links to protein function and disease. Moreover, another HDL particle protein, ApoL1 is also elevated in the plasma of SALS patients. Thus, we will further study levels of these proteins in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid, investigate genetic variants that may confer risk of ALS, and carry out studies in cell culture and genetically modified animals to study how these proteins may contribute to ALS.","1889160; ","SIDDIQUE, TEEPU ;","MCALLISTER, KIMBERLY A","02/01/2013","10/31/2017","Affect; Age; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Anabolism; Animals; Apolipoproteins; Archives; aryldialkylphosphatase; base; Blood; C9orf72; Cardiovascular Diseases; case control; Cell Culture Techniques; Cells; Cerebrospinal Fluid; Cholesterol; cohort; Collection; Data; Disease; DNA Resequencing; Elderly; Environment; Enzymes; Etiology; Event; Familial disease; Fatty acid glycerol esters; Functional disorder; Gender; Gene Cluster; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Targeting; Genes; Genetic; genetic association; Genetic Polymorphism; genetic variant; Genetically Engineered Mouse; Genetically Modified Animals; Genome; Genotype; Health; High Density Lipoproteins; high throughput technology; Homeostasis; Human; Inflammation; Insecticides; Laboratories; Lead; Link; Lipids; Lipoproteins; Low-Density Lipoproteins; Mass Spectrum Analysis; Measures; Mediating; Metabolic Diseases; Methodology; Methods; middle age; Mus; Mutation; Nerve Degeneration; Neuraxis; Neurodegenerative Disorders; Neurons; oxidation; oxidative damage; oxidized lipid; Pancreas; particle; Patients; Pesticides; Physiology; Plasma; Process; prospective; protein function; protein TDP-43; Proteins; Proteome; Race; response; Risk; rodent genome; Sampling; Serum; Single Nucleotide Polymorphism; Site; stressor; Superoxide Dismutase; Techniques; Testing; Time; Tissues; Training; Transgenic Model; ubiquilin; Variant; vector; Work; ","Association of ALS to gene-environment mediated changes in HDL proteins","022310","CNN","Clinical Neuroscience and Neurodegeneration Study Section ","","","05","381908","208140","590048",""

This study will allow for the examination of potential mediating factors and exploration of the mechanisms underlying the association between BPA exposure and GDM risk and to address an important public health concern: the potentially harmful effects of BPA on pregnancy glucose metabolism and diabetes.

The goal of this project is to understand the underlying genetic differences among African American  and white prostate cancer and the importance of these differences to prostate cancer aggressiveness and  response to treatment. This research will be done together by a laboratory at North Carolina Central University  (NCCU), an Institution Serving Underserved health disparity Populations and underrepresented Students, and a  laboratory at the Duke Cancer Institute (DCI), a National Cancer Institute-designated Cancer Center. Therefore,  the focused research on differences in cancer among racial groups will enhance the capacity of such research  being performed at both NCCU and the DCI. In addition, this research project will provide training in this field to  two junior researchers and a minority fellow. The outcome of this project could have profound implications for  the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of this disease for African Americans, reducing the number of African  American men who are diagnosed with prostate cancer and who die from prostate cancer.","12108531; ","ONYENWOKE, ROB U;","","","","5'-AMP-activated protein kinase; abiraterone; Acetates; Address; Affect; African American; Aftercare; Age; Alternative Splicing; Androgen Antagonists; Androgen Receptor; Androgens; Antiandrogen Therapy; anticancer research; Automobile Driving; Biological; Biological Factors; Biological Markers; Biomanufacturing; Biopsy Specimen; Cancer Biology; Cancer Burden; Cancer Center; cancer health disparity; cancer risk; Cellular biology; Characteristics; Clinical; Clinical Trials; Collaborations; Data; Data Set; Development; Diagnosis; Disease; Elements; Enrollment; Event; Exhibits; Faculty; Gene Targeting; Genes; Genetic; genomic data; Genotype; Goals; health disparity; Hormonal; Incidence; Institutes; Institution; Joints; Laboratories; Malignant neoplasm of prostate; Malignant Neoplasms; member; men; Minority; Molecular; mortality; National Cancer Institute; North Carolina; novel; Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences; Oligonucleotides; Outcome; Patients; Phenotype; Pilot Projects; Plasma; Play; Population; population based; Postdoctoral Fellow; pre-clinical; Precision therapeutics; Prevention; prostate cancer cell; prostate cancer model; Prostate-Specific Antigen; Race; Receptor Inhibition; Receptor Signaling; Research; Research Institute; Research Personnel; Research Project Grants; response; RNA; RNA Splicing; Role; Signal Transduction; Single Nucleotide Polymorphism; small molecule; small molecule therapeutics; social health determinants; Spliced Genes; Steroids; survival prediction; Technology; Therapeutic; Training; Translational Research; treatment response; tumor; Tumor Cell Biology; tumor progression; Underrepresented Students; Universities; Variant; Whole Blood; Work; ","Project 1: Interrogation of novel race-related alternatively spliced androgen receptor target genes in prostate cancer.","202924","ZCA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","7155","A1","01","20940","9214","","30154"

Given that poor sleep is one of the most common concerns in this newly retuning cohort of Veterans, a behavioral treatment that directly addresses insomnia in this group is of utmost importance to the VA. We also know that Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans report serious barriers to seeking care in mental health clinics, where behavioral insomnia treatment is most commonly provided, and that those most in need are least likely to seek services.

Hearing loss and tinnitus are the two most common service-related disabilities and can have a profound effect on communication ability and quality of life. Recent animal studies suggest loud noise exposure can lead to a loss of auditory neurons that is not detectable by standard hearing tests. This neuronal loss may be associated with tinnitus, hypersensitivity to loud sounds, and difficulty understanding speech. We propose to identify physiological measures that can detect auditory neuronal loss in individuals who have experienced high levels of noise exposure. These measures will provide the basis for a clinical test battery to diagnose auditory neuronal loss, potentially also providing an objective method of diagnosing tinnitus in Veterans.","9249358; ","BRAMHALL, NAOMI ;","","11/01/2016","10/31/2021","Acoustic Nerve; age effect; Animal Model; Animals; Audiometry; Auditory; Auditory area; Auditory Brainstem Responses; Auditory Evoked Potentials; Auditory Physiology; Auditory Threshold; base; Belief; Brain Stem; Caring; Clinical; clinical Diagnosis; Communication; Contralateral; Data; Development; Diagnosis; disability; Elements; experience; Exposure to; Feedback; Future; Goals; Hair Cells; hearing impairment; Hearing Tests; Human; Hyperactive behavior; Hyperacusis; Hypersensitivity; improved; Individual; innovation; Lead; Literature; man; Measures; Medial; method development; Methods; Military Personnel; Monitor; neuron loss; Neurons; Noise; Outer Hair Cells; Pathway interactions; Perception; Phase; Physiological; Population; Prevalence; prevent; Prevention; Prevention strategy; Process; Quality of life; Recording of previous events; Research; research clinical testing; response; Response Latencies; Risk; Services; sound; Speech; Spontaneous Otoacoustic Emissions; Stimulus; Synapses; Testing; Tinnitus; Veterans; ","Uncovering Physiological Markers of Hidden Hearing Loss","002104","RRD9","Career Development Program - Panel II ","","A1","01","","","",""

Around 50% of the injuries are to the cervical spine resulting in tetraplegia. An important rehabilitation goal in this population is recovery of upper limb function which could decrease medical costs and improve their quality of life. Re-establishing active grasp and pinch strength to the hand can be accomplished by surgeries that transfer the tendon of a strong muscle to restore strength to a paralyzed muscle, but the outcomes of the surgeries are variable. We have demonstrated in an ongoing study, the functional gains after surgery can be improved with a focused therapy program to retrain the transferred muscle. The proposed study examines the cortical mechanisms that drive successful muscle re-education after surgery. Understanding the neural activity associated with functional performance can help to predict who will respond to therapy and will guide evidence-based rehabilitation programs to improve upper limb function in tetraplegia.","10178393; ","JOHANSON, MARY ELISE;","","07/01/2015","06/30/2017","Acute; Address; Area; base; Base of the Brain; Biofeedback; blood oxygen level dependent; Brain; Caring; Cervical; Cervical spine; Chronic; conventional therapy; cost; Data; design; Distal; Education; Effectiveness; Elbow; Evaluation; evidence base; Feedback; Flexor; functional gain; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; functional outcomes; functional status; Future; Goals; grasp; Hand; Home environment; Image; improved; Individual; Injury; Intervention; Investigation; Isometric Exercise; Lateral; Lead; Learning; Length of Stay; Location; Measurement; Measures; Medical; meetings; Motor; motor control; Motor Cortex; motor learning; Muscle; nerve injury; Neural Pathways; neural patterning; neuroadaptation; neuroimaging; neuromuscular system; novel; Operative Surgical Procedures; Outcome; Outcome Measure; Paralysed; Participant; Patient Self-Report; Patients; Pattern; Performance; Persons; Pilot Projects; Population; Postoperative Period; Posture; Procedures; Production; programs; prospective; Protocols documentation; Psychological Transfer; public health relevance; Quadriplegia; Quality of life; Recovery; Recovery of Function; Rehabilitation therapy; relating to nervous system; Research Design; response; sensory cortex; Specificity; Spinal cord injury; Spinal cord injury patients; successful intervention; Techniques; Tendon structure; Tendon Transfer; Thumb structure; tool; Training; Training Programs; Translating; United States; Upper Extremity; Wit; Work; ","Evaluating Neural Adaptation after Tendon Transfer and Task-based Training in SCI","001772","RRDS","Rehabilitation Research and Development SPiRE Program ","","","02","","","",""

It affects a large sector of the population, with two million cases in the United States. Veterans are especially susceptible to neuropathic pain because it can arise from causes related to combat, like wounds and surgery, or from diseases that impact aging Veterans, like diabetes. Indeed, Veterans present a higher incidence of chronic pain than the general population: 50% of Veteran patients suffer from at least one type of chronic pain. Neuropathic pain is notoriously difficult to treat because it responds poorly to opiates. Indeed, there are alarming new findings that show that opiates can increase the long-term pain produced by surgical incision and inflammatory agents. This project will investigate the changes in pain neural pathways that underlie the persistent, episodic nature of neuropathic pain, with the long-term goal of finding ways of restoring the normal pain-free state.","1953518; ","MARVIZON, JUAN CARLOS GARCIA;","","11/01/2015","10/31/2019","Adenylate Cyclase; Adrenergic Receptor; Affect; Afferent Neurons; Aging; Animals; Attention; Calcium; Calcium Channel; Characteristics; chronic pain; combat; Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone; Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases; Diabetes Mellitus; Disease; Disease remission; dorsal horn; Dynorphins; Esthesia; Feedback; General Population; Genes; Goals; Human; Hyperalgesia; Hypersensitivity; Image; Incidence; Inflammation; Inflammatory; inhibitor/antagonist; Injury; interdisciplinary approach; Knockout Mice; Lead; Lesion; Measures; Mediating; Modeling; Molecular; Molecular Target; Mus; N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors; Narcotic Antagonists; Nature; Nerve; nerve injury; Neural Pathways; Neuraxis; Neurons; Neuropathy; NMDA receptor antagonist; Nociception; Normalcy; Operative Surgical Procedures; Opiates; Opioid; Opioid Peptide; Opioid Receptor; Outcome; Pain; Pain Disorder; Pain-Free; painful neuropathy; palliative; patch clamp; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase; Phosphorylation; Population; Posterior Horn Cells; Pro-Opiomelanocortin; proenkephalin; Rattus; receptor; receptor internalization; Research; response; Rodent Model; Role; Services; Signal Pathway; Skin; spared nerve; Spinal Cord; spontaneous pain; Stimulus; Stress; Surgical incisions; Testing; Transgenic Mice; United States; Veterans; voltage; Western Blotting; Work; ","Latent Sensitization and Neuropathic Pain","001646","RRDA","Spinal Cord Injury ","","","02","","","",""

This work will fill the current gap in our knowledge in structures and interaction of the several important replication initiators. Yeast and human are two model systems for learning how DNA replication may occur in a cell. It has been well known that DNA and its associated chromatin structures must be duplicated in a tightly controlled and accurate manner, in order to maintain the integrity of the cellular genome from generation to generation. Interruption of these controls can destabilize genome and lead to tumorigenesis. Understanding the structure and interaction of essential DNA replication proteins will enable small molecule based therapeutic intervention of cancers and many other proliferative disorders.","7850879; ","LI, HUILIN ;","FLICKER, PAULA F.","08/01/2015","03/31/2019","Architecture; base; Binding; Biological Models; Biology; Cell Cycle; Cell Proliferation; Cells; Chromatin Structure; chromosome replication; Collaborations; Complex; Computer software; Crystallography; detector; Disease; DNA; DNA Binding; DNA biosynthesis; DNA replication fork; DNA replication origin; ds-DNA; Electrons; Ensure; Eukaryota; Event; Failure; flexibility; Generations; Genome; Goals; Health; helicase; Human; improved; Interruption; Knowledge; Laboratories; Lead; Learning; Licensing Factor; Malignant Neoplasms; man; Maps; MCM2 gene; Medical Research; melting; Molecular; Molecular Biology; Molecular Conformation; mutant; origin recognition complex; Peptides; Pre-Replication Complex; Process; protein complex; Proteins; Publishing; Recruitment Activity; Replication Initiation; Replication Licensing; Replication Origin; Reporting; Resolution; Roentgen Rays; S Phase; Series; skills; small molecule; Structure; System; Testing; Therapeutic Intervention; Titan; tumor; tumorigenesis; Universities; Work; X-Ray Crystallography; Yeasts; ","Structural Basis of Eukaryotic Replication Initiation by Cryo-EM","111742","MSFC","Macromolecular Structure and Function C Study Section ","","","03","197500","114550","312050",""

Among survivors, 73-88% present with sensorimotor impairments affecting UE function and 55-75% experience difficulty using the UE for daily living activities. To date, rehabilitation for UE hemiparesis post-stroke has produced highly variable outcomes revealing minimal genuine change in motor impairment or functional use of the affected UE. This lack of therapeutic efficacy results from limited understanding of motor recovery following stroke. The prevalence and persistence of stroke-related motor dysfunction points to an urgent, unmet need to develop therapies that restore UE motor function.

We have developed a model of human Type I Autoimmune Polyendocrine Syndrome (APS1): A human disease of extreme immunological significance. Our focus will be on autoimmune disease of the gonads. These diseases are cause of idiopathic human infertility affecting 1 of 7 married couples desiring children. Infertility is not fatal but t prevents life. Autoimmune orchitis and epididymitis occur in vasectomized animals and humans. Over half a million men per year are vasectomized in the US.

We hypothesize that chronic cogntiive and neurobehavioral changes following repetitive TBI result from CTE-linked Tau and TDP-43 proteinopathy development. We propose to use established mouse model for rCHI with wildtype and two transgenic mice, novel protein biochemical, immunoassay and biomarker tools, and a battery of chronic neurobehavioral tests to mimic the post TBI neurological conditions experienced by Veterans with chronic TBI. Thus, the proposed study will validate our ultrasensitive CTE biomarker tests and examine a novel CTE-linked proteinopathy-based immunotherapy towards improvement of neurobehavioral deficits. Importantly, learning from this immunotherapy approach can rapidly translate into clinical studies.

Third, the yoga intervention studied in this trial may fill a gap by providing an intervention that relieves PTSD symptoms but does not require the often avoided direct verbal trauma processing central to current evidence-based interventions for PTSD.

There remains substantial uncertainty, however, regarding the short term benefits and the long term consequences of arthroscopic meniscectomy in patients with degenerative meniscus tears. Of major concern is the fact that degenerative meniscus tears are associated with osteoarthritis, and it is known that within two years of surgery, arthroscopic debridement for osteoarthritis is no better than placebo in relieving pain and restoring function (Moseley et al., 2002). Longer term, meniscectomy has been shown to be associated with elevated risk of osteoarthritis development, raising the concern that meniscectomy can actually be harmful (Englund et al., 2003). We aim to determine whether meniscectomy in the setting of a degenerative meniscus tear is of any clinical value. Determining this would either justify the expenses associated with arthroscopic meniscectomy on a large number of patients, or would identify an area of significant potential cost savings.","9822003; ","GIORI, NICHOLAS ;","","10/01/2013","09/30/2017","Address; Age; age group; Area; Arthritis; Arthroscopic Surgical Procedures; Arthroscopy; articular cartilage; base; Biological; Blinded; Cartilage; cartilage degradation; Cartilage Matrix; Clinical; Clinical Trials; Complement; complement system; Control Groups; Controlled Study; cost; Cost Savings; Data; Debridement; Degenerative polyarthritis; Development; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; functional outcomes; functional restoration; Future; gait examination; Gene Expression Alteration; Goals; Health; Healthcare Systems; improved; Inferior; insight; Irrigation; Joints; Knee; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Maps; Measures; Medial; Meniscus structure of joint; Motion; Muscle; Operative Surgical Procedures; Orthopedic Surgical Procedures; Pain; Patient Care; Patient Self-Report; Patients; Placebos; Positioning Attribute; Procedures; prospective; Published Comment; Randomized; response; Risk; Rotation; Sodium; soft tissue; Surgical Flaps; System; Testing; Thick; Time; treatment planning; Uncertainty; Walking; Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index; ","Prospective Trial of Arthroscopic Meniscectomy for Degenerative Meniscus Tears","000924","RRD2","Musculoskeletal/Orthopedic Rehabilitation  ","","","04","","","",""

Hearing loss is one of the most common service-related disabilities and can have a profound effect on communication ability. Although hearing aids (HA) can ameliorate the condition, many individuals fit with HA still experience difficulty understanding speech.

Recent epidemiological evidence now links elevated Mn in drinking water to behavioral and learning deficits in children and additional scientific data suggest that the developing brain may be more sensitive to Mn and other heavy metals than the adult brain. Persistent inflammation within the non- neuronal cells of the brain, collectively termed glial cells, is linked with the progression of neurological injur due to Mn toxicity but the mechanisms by which this inflammatory state initiates and progresses are poorly understood, particularly during juvenile development. The proposed studies will therefore longitudinally examine neuroinflammatory responses to Mn in developing and aging mice using novel transgenic models in order to determine the basis for the sensitivity of children to the neurogical effects of Mn and to improve our understanding of how excessive exposure to Mn early in life may increase susceptibility to neurotoxic injury and neurodegenerative diseases during aging.","1902084; ","TJALKENS, RONALD B;","HOLLANDER, JONATHAN ","12/14/2012","10/31/2017","1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine; Address; Adolescent; Adult; Aging; Air; Animals; Astrocytes; Basal Ganglia; Basal Ganglia Diseases; basal ganglia injury; base; Behavioral; behavioral impairment; biological adaptation to stress; Brain; Cell Communication; Cells; Child; Child health care; chromatin protein; chromatin remodeling; Coculture Techniques; Data; Development; Diet; DNA; drinking water; Elements; Epidemiology; Event; expectation; Exposure to; Genes; Genetic; glial activation; Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein; Health; Heavy Metals; Human; Impaired cognition; improved; in vitro testing; in vivo; Individual; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Injury; Intoxication; Knockout Mice; Laboratories; Lead; Learning; Life; Link; loss of function; Manganese; Mediating; Medical; Microglia; Modeling; Molecular; Mouse Strains; Mus; nervous system disorder; neurochemistry; Neurodegenerative Disorders; Neuroglia; neuroinflammation; Neurologic; Neurologic Dysfunctions; Neuronal Dysfunction; Neuronal Injury; Neurons; neurotoxic; neurotoxicity; Neurotoxins; NF-kappa B; NOS2A gene; novel; Nuclear; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Pattern; Phenotype; Phosphotransferases; Predisposition; Puberty; Public Health; Regulation; Reporter; response; Risk; Role; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Structure; Testing; TNF gene; Toxic effect; Transgenic Model; Transgenic Organisms; Weaning; Work; ","Neuroinflammation and developmental vulnerability to manganese toxicity","021656","NAL","Neurotoxicology and Alcohol Study Section ","","","05","479648","185806","665454",""

Alarmingly, incidence of ASD is increasing - a trend which cannot completely be explained by increased awareness and broader diagnostic criteria. Environmental factors are implicated in the pathogenesis of these disorders and postulated to interact with genetic susceptibilities. However, the mechanisms by which environmental chemicals interact with genetic factors to confer individual risk remain a current knowledge gap in our understanding of ASD etiology. DNA methylation is a critical gene expression regulatory mechanism in normal brain development and ASD, which can be influenced by environmental chemicals as well as dietary supplementation with folic acid. Thus, DNA methylation may act at the interface of genetic and environmental ASD risk and protective factors. These studies will combine environmental exposure in genetically susceptible mouse models to identify DNA methylation as a convergent target of gene and environment exposures, and provide a rational approach for effective intervention strategies to reduce the incidence or severity of neurodevelopmental disorders.","12420986; ","KEIL, KIMBERLY PRESTON;","KROTOSKI, DANUTA ","07/06/2016","06/30/2019","Address; Adverse effects; Affect; Animals; autism spectrum disorder; Awareness; Behavior; Brain; Calcium Signaling; career; CGG repeat expansion; Characteristics; Child; Consultations; Data; Development; developmental neurotoxicity; Diagnosis; Diagnostic; Diet; Dietary Factors; Dietary Supplementation; Disease; disorder risk; DNA; DNA Methylation; DNMT3B gene; effective intervention; Environment; environmental chemical; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Risk Factor; Epigenetic Process; epigenome; Etiology; Exhibits; experience; Exposure to; Faculty; FMR1; Folic Acid; folic acid supplementation; Fragile X Syndrome; gain of function mutation; gene environment interaction; Gene Expression; Gene Targeting; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Goals; Growth; Hippocampus (Brain); Human; In Vitro; in vivo; Incidence; Individual; Intervention; knock-down; Knock-in; Knock-in Mouse; knockin animal; Knowledge; Lactation; Link; Literature; loss of function; member; Mental Retardation; Methylation; Modeling; Morphology; mouse model; Mus; Mutation; Neurodevelopmental Disorder; Neurodevelopmental Impairment; Neurons; Neurotoxins; new therapeutic target; novel; Nuclear; Outcome; overexpression; Pathogenesis; Phenocopy; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Population; pre-doctoral; preference; Pregnancy; prevent; prophylactic; Publishing; pup; Research; Research Personnel; Risk; Role; Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel; Ryanodine Receptors; RyR1; Severities; Sex Characteristics; Signal Transduction; skills; Small Interfering RNA; social; Social Behavior; Susceptibility Gene; tenure track; Testing; Therapeutic; Time; tool; Training; trend; United States; ","PCBs and heritable mutations in calcium signaling act via DNA methylation to disrupt dendritic growth andplasticity","088016","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","01","56118","","56118",""

Indeed, returning OEF/OIF Veterans have extraordinarily high rates of alcohol misuse and co-morbid psychiatric symptoms, indicating that future Veteran clinical populations will be particularly affected by AUDs. While FDA-approved medications are available to treat AUDs, their efficacy is low compared to available psychosocial treatments. Despite the lack of evidence for efficacy from controlled trials, antidepressants are frequently prescribed to clinical populations (including Veterans) with active AUDs.

The system will achieve application-critical performance attributes (including rapid and reliable sensor response, long operational lifetime, and low cost, all within a miniaturized platform suitable for individuals to carry or wear) via systematic design across all layers of the system and innovations in 1) miniaturizable ionic liquid electrochemical sensors, 2) multi-mode (voltammetric and impedance) electrochemical techniques with enhanced analytical information content, enabling sensitivity improvement, automated drift calibration, and sensing of diverse pollutants with a small number of physical sensor elements, and 3) computationally efficient sensor array processing algorithms for real-time classification and quantification of target analytes.

Our main scientific goal is to perform experiments that explain how environmental variables - such as temperature, humidity, and airflow - affect the ability of influenza viruses to spread among experimental guinea pigs; these results can then be analyzed mathematically so that we can better appreciate the cumulative effect of each individual variable on influenza transmission as a whole. Improved understanding of these variables will aid in designing public health interventions designed to interrupt the spread of influenza viruses among people, which has an enormous economic and health impact on populations worldwide.","10244533; ","BOUVIER, NICOLE M.;","HAUGUEL, TERESA M.","11/05/2014","10/31/2019","Address; Aerosols; Affect; Air; Animal Model; Animals; authority; base; Blood Circulation; California; Cavia; Climate; Complex; Data; Data Set; Dependence; Deposition; design; Disease Outbreaks; Dryness; Engineering; Environment; Epidemiology; Exhalation; experience; flu transmission; Goals; Health; health economics; Housing; Human; Humidity; Image; Imaging technology; improved; in vivo; Individual; Influenza; influenzavirus; innovation; Investigation; Laboratories; laboratory experiment; Laboratory Study; Liquid substance; Mechanics; medical schools; Modeling; novel; pandemic influenza; particle; physical science; Physicians; Physiology; Population; Positioning Attribute; Precipitation; Probability; Production; Public Health; public health intervention; Research; Research Design; Research Personnel; research study; Resolution; respiratory; Respiratory System; Respiratory tract structure; respiratory virus; Risk; Rodent; Science; Scientist; seasonal influenza; Site; skills; Social Behavior; Source; Speed; System; Techniques; Temperature; Theoretical model; therapy design; Time; transmission process; Universities; Viral; Viral Load result; viral transmission; virology; Virus; Work; ","Quantifying Environmental Variables Affecting Airborne Influenza Transmission","110703","VIRB","Virology - B Study Section ","","","03","307406","86875","394281",""
