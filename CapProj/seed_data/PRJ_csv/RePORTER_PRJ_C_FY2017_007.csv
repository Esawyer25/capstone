The underlying disease process, atherosclerosis, is driven by fat deposits and inflammation in the wall of blood vessels (arteries) We found five short peptide sequences derived from the main protein in low density lipoprotein (the 'bad' cholesterol) that protects mice from atherosclerosis when given as a vaccine. The proposed research is designed to find out how this protection works: we think the vaccination induces a type of white blood cells called regulatory T cells to make interleukin-10, an anti-inflammatory mediator of the immune system. We also propose to optimize the vaccination. We found that peptides that protect mice from atherosclerosis, but not others, bind very well to a key molecule of the immune system called MHC-II. Using this knowledge, we discovered 30 human peptides that can potentially be developed as a vaccine to protect people from atherosclerosis. At least one of these peptides will be thoroughly tested in mice for safety and efficacy. When this work is completed, we will know how our atherosclerosis vaccine protects mice and whether a candidate peptide for a vaccine to protect humans from atherosclerosis is effective in mice.","1881151; ","LEY, KLAUS F.;","HASAN, AHMED A.K.","11/15/2014","10/31/2018","Accounting; adaptive immunity; Adjuvant; Adverse effects; Affect; Affinity; Alleles; Animal Model; Anti-inflammatory; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Antibodies; Antigen-Presenting Cells; Antigens; Aorta; Apolipoprotein E; Apolipoproteins; Apolipoproteins B; Arterial Fatty Streak; Arteries; atheroprotective; Atherosclerosis; base; Binding; Biological Assay; Biological Markers; Blood Vessels; Bovine Serum Albumin; C57BL/6 Mouse; Cardiovascular system; CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes; Cell surface; cell type; Cells; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.); Cessation of life; chemokine; Cholesterol; Chronic; Core Protein; cytokine; Data; Dendritic Cells; Deposition; design; Disease; Dose; Epitopes; Evaluation; Event; experience; Face; Fatty acid glycerol esters; Foundations; Frequencies; Government; Health; Health Benefit; Heart; HLA-DR Antigens; HLA-DRB1; Homing; Host Defense; Human; hypercholesterolemia; Hypersensitivity; Image; Immune; Immune system; Immunization; Immunology; In Vitro; in vivo; Inflammation; Inflammation Mediators; Inflammatory; Institutes; Interleukin-10; Knockout Mice; Knowledge; LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins; Lesion; Leukocytes; Life; Low-Density Lipoproteins; macrophage; Maintenance; Major Histocompatibility Complex; mouse model; Mus; nanomolar; Oils; oxidized low density lipoprotein; Peptides; Peripheral arterial disease; Persons; Phenotype; prevent; Process; Production; Proliferating; protein aminoacid sequence; Proteins; Public Health; Publishing; receptor; Regimen; Regulatory T-Lymphocyte; Reporter; Reporting; Research; research study; Role; Safety; screening; Staining method; Stains; stroke; T-Lymphocyte; Testing; Th1 Cells; Thinking; Transgenic Mice; Translating; Vaccinated; Vaccination; vaccination strategy; Vaccines; Work; ","Vaccination with MHC-II restricted ApoB100 peptides to prevent atherosclerosis","121697","AICS","Atherosclerosis and Inflammation of the Cardiovascular System Study Section ","","","03","263000","173250","436250",""

These viruses all share common mechanisms of blocking the antiviral consequences of premature cell death affecting dissemination, immune control and latency. In the past funding period, this model organism has unveiled novel functions of monocytes during viral infection as well as previously unsuspected role of necroptosis in host defense. These transformative discoveries included the fact that the cell death pathways unleashed during virus infection may be dysregulated during development or tissue homeostasis to cause death or inflammatory disease in the animal. Going forward, we have designed experiments to use our existing knowledge and resources to dissect interlinked mitochondrial and cytosolic cell death pathways in host defense, to unveil additional novel caspase-independent pathways that complement apoptosis and are targeted by CMV-encoded cell death suppressors.","1894294; ","MOCARSKI, EDWARD S.;","BEISEL, CHRISTOPHER E.","03/01/1984","10/31/2021","Acute; adaptive immunity; Address; Affect; Animal Model; Animals; Antibodies; Antiviral Agents; Apoptosis; Apoptosis Inhibitor; Apoptotic; arm; Automobile Driving; Biology; BIRC3 gene; CASP8 gene; Caspase; Cause of Death; Cell Death; Cell Survival; Cells; cellular targeting; Cessation of life; complement pathway; cytokine; Cytomegalovirus; cytotoxic; Deposition; design; Development; Disease; DNA biosynthesis; Endothelial Cells; Epithelial Cells; Equilibrium; Family; fascinate; Funding; Genes; Germ Lines; Herpesviridae; Herpesvirus 1; Homeostasis; Host Defense; Host Defense Mechanism; Hour; Human; Human Herpesvirus 2; Immune; immune clearance; Immune response; Immunomodulators; Infection; Infection prevention; Inflammatory; Information Dissemination; Information Resources; insight; Interferon Receptor; Interferons; IRF3 gene; killer T cell; Life; macrophage; Mammals; Mediating; Mitochondria; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Modeling; monocyte; Murid herpesvirus 1; Mus; Mutant Strains Mice; N-terminal; Natural Immunity; Natural immunosuppression; Necrosis; novel; Nucleic Acids; pathogen; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Phase; Phosphotransferases; Play; premature; prevent; Primates; Production; Protein Kinase; Race; Rage; reactivation from latency; receptor; research study; RIPK1 gene; RIPK3 gene; Rodent; Role; RRM1 gene; sensor; Serine Protease; Signal Transduction; Simplexvirus; Site; Staging; System; T cell response; tissue tropism; Tissues; TNF gene; Tropism; Viral; Viral Pathogenesis; Virus; Virus Diseases; Virus Inhibitors; War; ","Cytomegalovirus DNA Replication and Inversion","020211","VIRA","Virology - A Study Section ","","A1","30","250000","137205","387205",""

These presentations include sexual and in utero transmission, birth defects, and neurologic complications. All of these involve aspects of ZIKV invasion into tissues that are ordinarily protected by specialized barriers.

There is a strong correlation between chronic drug use and increase susceptibility to HIV infection. Chronic drug users accounts for approximately a third of all cases of AIDS in the USA and the progression to AIDS dementia is markedly accelerated in opiate drug abusers. This proposal postulates that modulation of TLRs on gut epithelial cells by opioid drug abuse and HIV1- TAT may be a plausible mechanism for the persistent immune activation in these patients. Until now there are no published studies implicating TLRs in the dysregulated immune activation observed in HIV infected drug abusing population. These studies will allow for the delineation of the mechanisms and allow for the development of new therapeutic strategies to attenuate immune activation and reverse HIV disease progression both in HIV infected patients and in HIV infected drug abusing population.","1938024; ","ROY, SABITA ;","PUROHIT, VISHNUDUTT ","01/01/2013","12/31/2017","Accounting; Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Acute; AIDS Dementia Complex; Animals; antimicrobial peptide; Apical; Attenuated; attenuation; Bacterial Translocation; base; CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes; Chloroquine; Chronic; Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases; cytokine; Data; Defect; Development; Disease Progression; Drug abuse; Drug abuser; Drug usage; Drug user; Epidemic; Epithelial Cells; Functional disorder; gastrointestinal epithelium; Health; Heroin; HIV; HIV Infections; HIV-1; HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder; Homeostasis; immune activation; Immune System Diseases; Infection; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Intestines; Intravenous; Knockout Mice; Knowledge; MAP Kinase Gene; Messenger RNA; Microbe; microbial; Morphine; mouse model; mRNA Expression; Mus; MYLK gene; Naltrexone; non-drug; novel; novel therapeutic intervention; occludin; Opiates; Opioid; pathogen; Pathology; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phosphotransferases; Placebos; Play; Population; Predisposition; prevent; promoter; protein distribution; protein expression; Proteins; Publishing; receptor; Receptor Activation; receptor expression; Receptor Signaling; Reporting; rho; Role; Serum; statistics; T-Cell Depletion; Testing; Therapeutic; Tight Junctions; TLR2 gene; TLR4 gene; Toll-like receptors; Transgenic Organisms; ","Mechanism underlying Morphine modulation of gut barrier function in the Context o","034582","NAED","NeuroAIDS and other End-Organ Diseases Study Section ","","","05","127542","68234","195776",""

There is no specific therapy available for this disease. Premature activation of the digestive protease trypsin within pancreas, either because of pathological events or due to genetic defects in the gene is considered to be the key event in initiation of pancreatitis. However, the evidence supporting the role of trypsin is circumstantial at best. Our preliminary data using mice in which trypsin activation is not observed either due to lack of precursor (cationic trypsinogen) or due to lack of cathepsin B, the enzyme responsible for the activation show that trypsin activation is only partially responsible for the tissue damage observed in acute pancreatitis and does not affect the tissue injury in chronic pancreatitis. In this grant, we propose to investigate the role of trypsin activation in acute and chronic pancreatitis with a focus on its role in acinar cell injury and its relationship to activation of inflammatory pathways as well as its overall contribution to pancreatic injury. We will use multiple animal models of both acute and chronic pancreatitis to achieve these aims. With the successful completion of the proposed studies, we hope to achieve better insights into the mechanism of disease, which will help in design of targeted therapeutics for this important disease.","6485137; ","SALUJA, ASHOK K;","SERRANO, JOSE ","08/01/2011","05/31/2017","","Relative Contribution of Trypsin & Inflammation in Acute & Chronic Pancreatitis","093047","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","06","69780","37332","107112",""

The parieto-frontal circuitry has been demonstrated to be critical for decision-making and inhibitory control of action, both in human imaging studies and animal physiological experiments. However, we still do not understand core computations and their underlying mechanisms. Brain circuit modeling proposed in this application, with a focus on the parieto-frontal system, will elucidate gating mechanisms that underlie flexible visuo-motor behavior. It will be capable of accounting for single-neuron data and performance data from behaving animals, and provide a platform to elucidate the brain circuit mechanisms of different types of behavioral errors observed in humans. By uncovering the required biological mechanisms for flexible behavior, our work has a high potential for understanding molecular and circuit abnormalities that cause these cognitive deficits associated with mental illness like Schizophrenia and ADHD.","1891037; ","WANG, XIAO-JING ;","FERRANTE, MICHELE ","12/01/2000","10/31/2017","Accounting; Animals; Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; base; Base of the Brain; Behavior; Behavioral; behavioral response; Biological; Brain; brain circuitry; Characteristics; Code; Cognition; Cognitive deficits; Collaborations; Color; Complex; cortex mapping; Cues; Data; Decision Making; Discrimination; Equilibrium; executive function; flexibility; Functional disorder; Future; gaze; Goals; Health; Human; Image; information processing; insight; Laboratories; Maps; Mental disorders; Modeling; Molecular; Monkeys; Motion; Motor; Nature; network models; Network-based; neural circuit; Neurons; operation; Output; Pathway interactions; Patients; Performance; Physiological; Process; programs; Property; Recurrence; regenerative; relating to nervous system; Research; research study; response; Rewards; Role; Saccades; Schizophrenia; Sensory; sensory stimulus; Signal Transduction; Staging; Stimulus; Synaptic plasticity; System; Testing; Time; Weather; Work; ","Gated sensori-motor mapping and cortical circuit reconfiguration in flexible deci","062349","SMI","Sensorimotor Integration Study Section ","","","15","225000","119570","344570",""
