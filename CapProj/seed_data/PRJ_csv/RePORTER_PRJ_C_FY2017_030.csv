We propose to use an adult rat model of incomplete cervical spinal cord injury to investigate novel approaches, and their underlying mechanism, to maximize the functional effects of this plasticity and to translate the new knowledge into humans with spinal cord injury. Optimization of plasticity protocols in animal models will allow faster and efficient transition to clinical environments as well as better investigation of neuronal and structural mechanisms. Because deficits in voluntary control of upper-limb muscles and corticospinal transmission are a major problem after stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and other motor disorders,  our work may also be relevant for patients with other lesions of the CNS.","7692991 (contact); 9092913; ","OUDEGA, MARTIN  (contact); PEREZ, MONICA A;","","04/01/2016","03/31/2020","abstracting; Activities of Daily Living; Adult; Agonist; AMPA Receptors; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Animal Model; Animals; arm function; Axon; base; Behavioral; behavioral plasticity; Brain; Cervical spinal cord injury; Chemosensitization; Clinical; clinically relevant; Corticospinal Tracts; Cycloserine; Data; density; Development; Dextromethorphan; Electrophysiology (science); Environment; experience; experimental study; Forelimb; Frequencies; Generations; Glutamate Receptor; Glutamates; Goals; grasp; Hand; Hand functions; hand rehabilitation; Human; Impairment; improved; indexing; Intervention; Investigation; Knowledge; Lesion; Measures; Mediating; Methodology; Modeling; Modification; Molecular; Motor; motor disorder; Motor Evoked Potentials; motor function recovery; Motor Neurons; Motor Skills; Movement; Multiple Sclerosis; Muscle; N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors; N-Methylaspartate; Neuronal Plasticity; Neurons; NMDA receptor antagonist; novel; novel strategies; Outcome; Patients; Physiologic pulse; postsynaptic; Postsynaptic Membrane; Protocols documentation; public health relevance; Rattus; Recovery; Recovery of Function; Reporting; Research; Residual state; Spinal; Spinal Cord; Spinal cord injury; stroke; Synapses; Synaptic Transmission; Testing; Time; Training; Translating; transmission process; Upper Extremity; Work; ","Maximizing Spike - Timing Dependent Plasticity after Spinal Cord Injury","001807","RRDA","Spinal Cord Injury ","","","03","","","",""

Of these a quarter of men and a third of women will experience fracture of the hip, forearm or spine by age 60 due to effete bone. In 2005, the mortality in the year following fracture in the US was 20 to 25% and is expected to quadruple by 2025. Therapies such as hormone replacement and bisphophonates are problematic, such that osteoporosis remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly. Bone formation by osteoblasts and bone resorption by osteoclasts are normally coupled. Thus, old or weakened bone can be removed and replaced with strong new bone. Loss of estrogen at menopause leads to increased osteoclast numbers, and activation of pro-inflammatory T-cells in the bone marrow. The proposed studies will examine the role and mechanism used to counterbalance the activity of regulatory T-cells in inhibiting osteoporosis.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We have shown that regulatory T-cells of the CD8 lineage, called TcREG, can ameliorate osteoporosis in a mouse where menopause is initiated by ovariectomy. Here we propose experiments to understand how these cells are induced in vivo and how they limit bone loss. Insights from these experiments are likely to lead to new treatment modalities representing an entirely new and mechanistically distinct avenue than those currently in use or development for osteoporosis and other bone erosion diseases.","6607803; ","AURORA, RAJEEV ;","CHEN, FAYE H","04/01/2014","03/31/2019","Actins; activating transcription factor; Age; Antigen Presentation; Antigen-Presenting Cells; Antigens; Arthritis; Autoimmunity; base; bisphosphonate; bone; bone erosion; bone loss; Bone Marrow; Bone Resorption; bone turnover; Buffers; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; CD8B1 gene; Cells; Chronic; Coupled; cytokine; Data; Development; Disease; Elderly; Equilibrium; Estrogen Replacements; Estrogens; experience; experimental study; Exposure to; Feedback; Forearm; Foundations; Fracture; Healed; healing; Hip Fractures; Histocompatibility; Homeostasis; Hormones; IL2RA gene; Immune; Immune response; Immune system; Immunosuppressive Agents; in vivo; Inflammation; Inflammatory; insight; Interferons; Interleukin-10; Interleukin-6; International; Knowledge; Lead; Lymphocyte; men; Menopause; Modality; Modeling; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; mouse model; Mus; novel; Osteitis; Osteoblasts; Osteoclasts; Osteogenesis; osteoimmunology; Osteoporosis; Ovariectomy; pathogen; Postmenopausal Osteoporosis; prevent; Process; Production; Proteins; public health relevance; Regulation; Regulatory T-Lymphocyte; response; Rheumatoid Arthritis; Role; Serum; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; skeletal; Skeletal system; T-Cell Receptor; T-Lymphocyte; TNFSF11 gene; transcription factor; Vertebral column; Woman; ","A Negative Feedback Loop Between Osteoclasts and CD8 T-Cells","064821","SBDD","Skeletal Biology Development and Disease Study Section ","","","04","205968","106074","312042",""

It is currently known that the neurobehavioral symptoms (i.e., cognitive, emotional, and somatic) of pmTBI are more pronounced in the first few weeks of injury, but it is not known how long these symptoms should typically last. Standard neuroimaging techniques are not very sensitive to the diffuse injuries that occur following pmTBI. Therefore, we do not understand why these symptoms occur or why certain children recover whereas others do not. Children who remain symptomatic are faced with impairment in academic, interpersonal and social functioning, ultimately resulting in a reduced quality of life. A growing literature also suggests that repetitive traumatic events may result in long-term neuropsychiatric disturbances. Thus, developing biomarkers that are capable of tracking neurological change from the semi-acute to more chronic injury phases is a major public health objective. The current application will utilize state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques to quantify how diffuse injuries (e.g., gray matter, white matter and vascular) change during the dynamic course of pmTBI, and how they relate to neurobehavioral symptoms. This information is of vital significance for clinical decisions about injury severity and return to normal physical activity, as well as for ultimately developing treatments that target injury mechanisms rather than symptomatology.","8698443; ","MAYER, ANDREW ROBERT;","LAVAUTE, TIMOTHY M","07/01/2016","03/31/2021","18 year old; Academic achievement; Accident and Emergency department; Acute; Address; Adolescence; Affect; Animal Model; Animals; Attention; Biological Markers; Blood Vessels; Brain; Brain Injuries; cerebral atrophy; cerebrovascular; Cerebrovascular Circulation; Child; Childhood; Chronic; cingulate gyrus; Clinical; Clinical Data; clinical imaging; Clinical Trials; clinically significant; Cognitive; cognitive function; cognitive testing; cohort; computerized; Confidence Intervals; Consensus; Corpus striatum structure; Data; Development; Diagnosis; diagnosis standard; Diffuse; Diffuse Brain Injury; Diffusion; Edema; Emotional; evidence base; Exhibits; experience; follow-up; Foundations; Future; Goals; Gold; gray matter; Gray unit of radiation dose; Growth; hemodynamics; Image; imaging modality; Impaired cognition; Impairment; Individual; Injury; Intelligence; Interpersonal Relations; Intervention; Knowledge; Lateral; Learning; Lesion; Literature; Measurement; Measures; mild traumatic brain injury; Modeling; nerve injury; Neurobehavioral Manifestations; Neurobiology; neuroimaging; Neurologic; Neuronal Dysfunction; neuropathology; neurophysiology; neuropsychiatry; new therapeutic target; Outcome; Parents; Parietal; Pathology; Patient Self-Report; Patients; Phase; Physical activity; Play; Post-Concussion Syndrome; Problem behavior; processing speed; Prognostic Marker; Public Health; Quality of life; Recovery; Recruitment Activity; Research Design; Resolution; Rest; Risk; Role; Sample Size; Sampling; Severities; Social Functioning; Staging; Structure; symptomatology; Symptoms; Techniques; Thalamic structure; therapeutic target; Therapeutic Trials; therapy development; Time; tool; Trauma; traumatic event; Unconscious State; Water; white matter; white matter injury; Work; X-Ray Computed Tomography; Youth; ","The Impact of Diffuse Mild Brain Injury on Clinical Outcomes in Children","098494","ANIE","Acute Neural Injury and Epilepsy Study Section ","","","02","359201","238845","598046",""

Despite considerable research, effective treatments remain elusive. The symptom profile of GWI is similar to that of fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), another chronic multi-symptom condition, but where progress has been made in identifying effective medications. The lack of progress in finding effective treatments for GWI, and the symptom similarities between GWI and FMS, provides a rationale for determining if Duloxetine and Pregabalin, two FDA approved FMS medications, can provide some relief to Veterans who suffer from GWI. As Central Texas is home to the highest number of Gulf War Veterans in the nation, our research team is ideally situated to conduct the randomized clinical trial proposed for this RFA. Our team will determine if Duloxetine and Pregabalin given as monotherapies or in combination can reduce some of the symptoms experienced in Veterans who suffer from GWI.","1954743; ","DAVIDSON, DENA ;","","04/01/2014","09/30/2018","active method; Adrenal Glands; Adverse effects; arm; associated symptom; Biogenic Amines; Brain; Calcium Channel; central pain; Cerebrospinal Fluid; Chronic; chronic widespread pain; Classification Scheme; clinical practice; clinically relevant; Combined Modality Therapy; Complex; control trial; Data; Development; dosage; Dose; Double-Blind Method; duloxetine; effective therapy; experience; Fatigue; FDA approved; Fibromyalgia; gastrointestinal; Genes; Genetic; Gulf War; Headache; Health; Home environment; Hypothalamic structure; Immune response; impression; improved; inhibitor/antagonist; Kansas; Ligands; Measures; Mediator of activation protein; meetings; Memory; Mono-S; Moods; Nerve Growth Factors; Neurotransmitters; Norepinephrine; open label; Outcome; Pain; Pain Attribute; Pain management; Participant; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase; Physical Function; Pituitary Gland; Placebos; pregabalin; Process; Randomized; Randomized Clinical Trials; Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials; Randomized Controlled Trials; Regulation; Research; response; reuptake; Safety; Serotonin; Sleep; Sleep disturbances; Statistical Data Interpretation; Structure; Substance P; symptomatic improvement; Symptoms; Testing; Texas; Therapeutic; treatment group; Veterans; ","RCT of Duloxetine & Pregabalin for the treatment of Gulf War Illness in Veterans","000795","SPLD","Special Emphasis - Research on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses ","","","04","","","",""

Wounds heal in about 21 days in healthy patients. Aging increases this time. This research is compromised, however, by the lack of clinical grade exosomes. We propose to improve the packaging of essential factors into exosomes, and develop methods to increase their secretion so that they can be applied to hard to heal wounds in elderly and diabetic patients, to soldiers in field hospitals, emergency rooms, and supplied for home wound care.

Like the heart, spontaneous pumping of lymphatic vessels returns lymph centrally and this pumping is driven by an intrinsic pacemaker system, which appears to fail in lymphedema. This project will uses several knock-out mouse models to 1) study the ionic mechanisms controlling the lymphatic pacemaker; and 2) to simulate the human disease lymphedema distichiasis, a form of primary lymphedema in which valves in the lymphatic system are missing or improperly formed, resulting in an inefficient lymph pump and severe edema in the extremities during standing.

If there is a benefit to invasive testing and treatment, then clinicians and patients must be made aware of these benefits and put them into practice to prevent bad outcomes like heart attacks and death; if the results show there is no benefit from routine invasive testing, then treatment would begin with only intensive lifestyle change and medication to control symptoms and reduce risk.

Failure to fold correctly leads to accumulation of misfolded proteins and loss of protein function, which has been associated with many pathological states. The long term goal of this Research Program is to understand how newly translated proteins fold in eukaryotic cells. Our general strategy to elucidate how chaperones mediate the folding of newly synthesized proteins relies on the close integration of in vitro and in vivo approaches. Our proposed experiments are aimed at obtaining functional, mechanistic and structural insights into the role of chaperones in de novo folding.","1899521; ","FRYDMAN, JUDITH ;","FAUPEL-BADGER, JESSICA ","09/01/1997","02/28/2018","Address; base; Binding; Biogenesis; Cell-Free System; Cells; Characteristics; Complex; crosslink; Cryoelectron Microscopy; Cytosol; defined contribution; design; Elements; Eukaryotic Cell; Event; Exhibits; Experimental Designs; experimental study; Failure; Funding; genetic information; Goals; Health; Immunoprecipitation; In Vitro; in vivo; Individual; innovation; insight; Knowledge; Link; Maps; Mediating; misfolded protein; Modeling; Molecular Chaperones; Molecular Conformation; mutant; Mutation; Names; novel; Pathway interactions; polypeptide; prefoldin; Process; programs; Protein Biosynthesis; protein folding; protein function; Proteins; Proteome; reconstitution; Research; Resolution; Ribosomes; Role; Staging; System; Testing; Translating; Translations; Work; Yeasts; ","Protein Folding in the Eukaryotic Cytosol","056433","MBPP","Membrane Biology and Protein Processing Study Section ","","","18","68096","38806","106902",""

This application incorporates two longitudinal studies that examine the relation between development of spoken word recognition skills and pre-school language outcomes. One explores receptive language development in healthy full-term infants, examining how such development may be determined by both endogenous factors, including cognitive abilities, speech perception skills, and fluctuations in infants' functional hearing, and exogenous factors, such as input quantity. A second, concurrent study explores language development in preterm infants, a population known to be at risk for language delays. The overarching goals of these studies is to elucidate the pathways from early cognitive development, basic speech perception skills, and language experience to development of spoken word recognition and early language knowledge, and hence to pre-school language outcomes, and to examine how these pathways may differ for the two populations to be studied.","1955129; ","MORGAN, JAMES L;","ALVAREZ, RUBEN P","04/01/2012","03/31/2018","Acoustics; Address; Adult; Affect; Age; Birth; Characteristics; Chinese People; Cognitive; cognitive ability; cognitive development; cognitive testing; Cohort Studies; combinatorial; Complex; Development; Endogenous Factors; Enrollment; Environment; Exogenous Factors; experience; Goals; Growth; Hearing; Individual; infancy; Infant; infant monitoring; Knowledge; Language; language comprehension; Language Delays; Language Development; Language Disorders; Learning; Life; Linguistics; Literature; Longitudinal Studies; Low Birth Weight Infant; Measures; Mediating; Nursery Schools; Outcome; Pathway interactions; Performance; Phonetics; Plant Roots; Play; Population; Pregnancy; Premature Infant; Research; Retrieval; Risk; Role; Sampling; Schools; Semantics; skills; Speech; Speech Perception; speech processing; Structure; syntax; Testing; theories; Variant; Vocabulary; word learning; ","Longitudinal Studies of Spoken Word Recognition and Language Development","068501","LCOM","Language and Communication Study Section ","","","05","282511","166194","448705",""

The biology modules will be taught by near-peer mentors, well-trained college students, to comprehensive general biology students, those deemed unprepared in terms of college preparation in math and science, from mostly under-represented groups in scientific professions. The proposed program outlined in this application seeks to perform efficacy evaluations through attitude surveys and specific task-based assessments, of this in-classroom intervention. These activities have been pilot-tested in an informal environment or have similarities to already tested activities used in the classroom. The hands-on activities and near- peer mentor training materials will be available on a Wiki further developed through this project. Moreover, many of these inquiry-based activities will utilize available apps on smart phones for their classroom implementation. The hypothesis is that near-peer mentors - well-trained, often minority college students in biology and biomedical programs at area colleges and universities or recently graduated from them - can improve the attitudes and concept learning of students in a 10th grade general biology course in Maryland. This study will also evaluate high school assessments from this cohort of students from this high school with a paired, demographically matched high school in Prince George's County, School Board District 3. Cohort grades and parental opinion will also be acquired as available based on course work and parental availability, respectively. Dissemination of the materials and program will be accomplished in the paired school where intervention did not occur, but in a subsequent year of 10th grade General Biology students. Additional schools will be involved in dissemination in Prince George's County Public Schools.","9094320; ","YOURICK, DEBRA LYNN;","BECK, LAWRENCE A.","05/15/2014","02/28/2019","Animal Model; Antibiotics; Area; Attitude; Award; Bacteriophages; base; Biological Models; Biology; Biomedical Engineering; Biomedical Research; Cell physiology; Cellular Phone; cohort; collaborative environment; college; College Preparation; Communication; Complex; County; Data; Disadvantaged; Disease; education research; Educational Curriculum; Educational process of instructing; efficacy evaluation; Electrophysiology (science); Entomology; Equipment; Eubacterium; Eukaryota; expectation; Fungi Model; fungus; Future Teacher; Health; high school; High School Student; improved; innovation; Internships; Intervention; Invertebrates; Investigation; Joints; Laboratories; Learning; Libraries; Life; Maryland; mathematical sciences; Mentors; Methodology; Minority; Molecular; neuroprotection; Normalcy; novel; Operon; Oral; peer coaching; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phylogeny; Plasmids; practical application; Process; programs; Prokaryotic Cells; Prosthesis; Protozoa; Research; Research Design; Research Institute; Resources; Robotics; Schools; Science; science education; Site; skills; Students; Surveys; Tablets; teacher; Technical Expertise; tenth grade; Testing; Tetrahymena; Tetrapoda; Training; Underserved Students; Universities; university student; Ursidae Family; Virus; wiki; Work; Writing; ","In-school Internships for Students and Teachers in Under-Served Schools","016515","ZTR1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","04","242501","0","242501",""

The mechanisms that underlie HIV invasion of the brain and neurologic injury are not clearly understood. Specifically, there is an underappreciation for the potential role of CD4+ T cells in HIV neuroinvasion. We identified a unique subset of cells known as CD4dimCD8bright T cells or double positive (DP) T cells for brevity here. DP T cells are found in the brain and seem to exert potent anti-HIV responses. The consequence of this response is controlling HIV on one hand but perhaps at the cost of inducing inflammation and injury in the brain. This application will address the role of CD4+ T cells and DP T cells in HIV invasion into the brain. We will also define the mechanism that drives DP T cells persistence in the brain as a potential novel reservoir for HIV, and define the role of DP in HAND. Collectively, our studies will provide a paradigm shift into contribution of unique cells into HIV neuroinvasion and highlight potential approaches for therapeutic intervention ","6664326; ","AL-HARTHI, LENA ;","JOSEPH, JEYMOHAN ","04/20/2017","01/31/2022","abstracting; Address; Age; Animal Model; Animals; Anti-Retroviral Agents; antimicrobial; Antiviral Response; Astrocytes; Automobile Driving; base; beta catenin; Blood; Brain; CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; CD8B1 gene; Cells; Chronic; Clinical; Clinical Research; Collaborations; cost; Data; Environment; Equilibrium; Exhibits; Frequencies; Gene Targeting; Genetic Transcription; Hawaii; HIV; HIV Infections; HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder; Human; humanized mouse; Immune; In Vitro; in vivo; Individual; Infection; Inflammation; Inflammatory Response; Injury; insight; Invaded; Ligands; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; migration; Military Personnel; Modeling; motor impairment; Mus; nervous system disorder; Neurocognitive; Neurocognitive Deficit; neuroinflammation; Neurologic; Neurologic Deficit; Neuronal Injury; Neuropathogenesis; novel; novel strategies; novel therapeutic intervention; Outcome; Participant; Pathway interactions; Patients; Performance; Peripheral; Ploidies; Population; programs; Publishing; reconstitution; Research; Research Personnel; response; Role; Sampling; Signal Transduction; Site; SIV; Source; Southeastern Asia; Staging; Surface; Surveys; T cell response; T-Lymphocyte; T-Lymphocyte Subsets; Testing; Therapeutic Intervention; Universities; Viral; ","Neuroimmune axis in HAND and HIV persistence in the brain","113425","NAED","NeuroAIDS and other End-Organ Diseases Study Section ","","","01","323365","177851","501216",""

Acquired autoimmune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is an uncommon disorder characterized by acute episodes of systemic microvascular thrombosis. TTP is more common in women, occurs during the child-bearing years, and rarely occurs in children <18 years of age. Recovery from acute episodes was thought to be complete; however, these patients suffer from residual problems long after they recover.

There is currently no cure. It is estimated that 1 in every 10,000 people in Western countries are affected or at risk for inheriting  the disease from an affected parent. The mechanism of neurodegeneration is not fully understood, but recent studies suggest that transient knockdown of Htt messenger RNA in neurons can reverse disease progression without compromising normal cellular function in vivo. RNA interference using siRNA is the most promising therapeutic approach for transient Htt mRNA silencing, but there are several limitations to its use in the clinic. The proposed research seeks to develop new methods for the safe and effective delivery of siRNA therapeutics to the brain.","10188393; ","OSBORN, MAIRE F;","MILLER, DANIEL L","04/01/2016","03/31/2019","Acids; Adverse effects; Affect; Behavior; Blood - brain barrier anatomy; Brain; CAG repeat; Cell physiology; Cell Survival; Cephalic; Cerebrospinal Fluid; Chemicals; Cholesterol; Clinic; clinically relevant; Corpus striatum structure; Country; design; Development; Diffuse; Diffusion; Disease; Disease Progression; Dopamine Uptake Inhibitors; Dose; Drug Kinetics; Engineering; Exhibits; Exons; Formulation; Gangliosides; Genes; Genetic; Goals; Huntington Disease; Huntington gene; Hydrophobicity; Immune system; Immunization; immunogenicity; Impaired cognition; improved; in vivo; Inherited; Injection of therapeutic agent; insight; interest; Intracarotid; Intraventricular; Kinetics; knock-down; Label; lipid biosynthesis; lipid metabolism; Lipids; Liquid substance; Mediating; Membrane; Messenger RNA; Metabolic Pathway; Metabolism; Methods; Modality; Motor; Mus; nanoparticle; Nerve Degeneration; nervous system disorder; Neuraxis; Neurodegenerative Disorders; neuroinflammation; neuron loss; Neurons; neuropsychiatry; neurotoxicity; Oligonucleotides; Organ; Parents; Pharmacodynamics; Phospholipids; Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids; Process; Property; public health relevance; receptor; Research; response; Risk; RNA Interference; Safety; Signal Transduction; Small Interfering RNA; Spinal Cord; Steroids; Therapeutic; Time; Tissues; Toxic effect; trafficking; Transgenic Organisms; Trinucleotide Repeat Expansion; uptake; Wild Type Mouse; Work; ","Enhancing siRNA delivery and efficacy in the brain through conjugation of bioactive, polyunsaturated fatty acids","095508","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","59166","","59166",""

It has not been previously possible to obtain whole genome patterns of modified cytosines at single nucleotide resolution with acceptable levels of accuracy, sensitivity, and economy; we propose to develop a radically new method that will map all modified cytosines with much greater efficiency than any existing method.

We have shown that adipose stem / stromal cells (ASC), which are readily available and cultured, markedly ameliorate ischemia and inflammation in multiple organs, including the heart; that these effects are mediated by paracrine factors and lead to major changes in circadian and mitochondrial gene transcription.

We will investigate whether ROS-induced transcription factors in the presence of Meth are modulated by a TATA-box based mechanism triggered by HIV Tat, altering the phenotype of glial cells towards a higher expression of CCR5 and RANTES, exacerbating the inflammatory milieu and promoting viral replication: these are potentially novel modes of regulation of molecules such as CCR5 in the context of drugs of abuse and HIV, relevant for immune function in the brain, and open an original translational perspective for understanding the susceptibility to inflammatory neuropathology in amphetamine users.","9436441; ","MARCONDES, MARIA CECILIA GARIBALDI;","POLLOCK, JONATHAN D","04/01/2017","03/31/2018","Address; Affect; Amphetamine Users; Astrocytes; base; Behavior; Binding; Binding Sites; Blood - brain barrier anatomy; Brain; brain cell; CCR5 gene; Cell Line; Cells; Characteristics; chemokine; chemokine receptor; Coculture Techniques; CREB1 gene; Data; Disease Progression; Dopamine; Dose; drug of abuse; Elements; Equilibrium; Generations; Genes; Genetic Transcription; glial activation; Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein; Health; high risk behavior; HIV; HIV Infections; HIV-1; Immune; immune function; immunocytochemistry; In Vitro; in vivo; Infection; Infiltration; Inflammatory; inflammatory marker; inflammatory milieu; inflammatory modulation; Inflammatory Response; Investigation; Macaca; macrophage; Mediating; Methamphetamine; methamphetamine abuse; methamphetamine use; Microglia; Mus; Neuraxis; neuroAIDS; Neuroglia; Neurons; neuropathology; novel; Nuclear Translocation; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Peptides; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phenotype; Phosphorylation; Play; Population; Predisposition; Process; promoter; RANTES; Reactive Oxygen Species; Regulation; Regulatory Element; Role; Signal Induction; Signal Transduction; SIV; Small Interfering RNA; Symptoms; System; TATA Box; transcription factor; Transcription Factor AP-1; Transgenic Mice; Up-Regulation; Ursidae Family; Viral Load result; Virus; Virus Replication; Western Blotting; ","Methamphetamine and HIV interactions in the regulation of glial activation","036164","ZDA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","05","254700","157320","412020",""

One major complication is widespread leakage of fluid from blood vessels into the surrounding tissues, which can cause shock and organ failure. This study addresses the hypothesis that leakage occurs in blood vessels called venules and that blood cells (leukocytes and platelets) can augment and/or limit leakage by specific mechanisms. The study may reveal new strategies to treat blood-vessel leakage in patients with sepsis.","1882289; 6877014 (contact); ","MCEVER, RODGER PAUL; XIA, LIJUN  (contact);","SARKAR, RITA ","04/01/2016","03/31/2020","Address; Adherens Junction; Adhesions; Agonist; ANGPT1 gene; Antibiotics; Autoimmunity; Bacteria; Blood Cells; Blood Circulation; Blood Platelets; Blood Vessels; C-Type Lectins; Complication; Data; Disease; Edema; Endothelial Cells; Endotoxemia; Exhibits; Extravasation; Health; Hemorrhage; Hemostatic function; High Endothelial Venule; Hypotension; Image; Impaired wound healing; Infection; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Inflammatory Response; Injection of therapeutic agent; Injury; insight; intravital microscopy; Leukocytes; Ligands; Ligation; Lipopolysaccharides; Liquid substance; lymph nodes; macrophage; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; Modeling; Mus; novel; Organ; Organ failure; pathogen; Patients; Peritoneum; Pharmaceutical Preparations; podoplanin; prevent; Puncture procedure; receptor; Regulation; response; Role; Sepsis; Shock; Side; Signal Transduction; sphingosine 1-phosphate; Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptor; Staining method; Stains; Testing; Tissues; two-photon; Vascular Permeabilities; venule; ","Platelet CLEC-2 regulation of vascular integrity during inflammation","128390","HT","Hemostasis and Thrombosis Study Section ","","","02","250000","178750","428750",""

Project Narrative Next-generation short-read sequencing (e.g. Illumina) has advantages of price, speed, accuracy, and broad adoption. With short-read sequencing, however, a key principle in genomics is severely limited: contiguity, a measure of fully-linked DNA sequence. Contiguity in the context of haplotype phasing and de novo assembly is critical for genomic medicine. Several companies have attempted to improve contiguity with long-read or synthetic long-read technologies by increasing read-length, or bar-coding, or reconstituting artificial chromatin. These methods are limited to 1-5% of the actual contiguity of a human chromosome, require specialized and expensive equipment, and are technically demanding. Arima has overcome these deficiencies with our easy- to-use and inexpensive Contigo DNA preparation kit that applies an improved HiC technology to achieve chromosome-span contiguity at a fraction of price of competing technologies and as a result the Contigo kit maximizes contiguity, convenience, and economy with compatibility to Illumina workflows.","12207486; ","SELVARAJ, SIDDARTH ;","SMITH, MICHAEL ","04/17/2017","03/31/2019","3-Dimensional; abstracting; Address; Adoption; Age related macular degeneration; Alleles; Bar Codes; base; Basic Science; Benchmarking; Biological Sciences; Cells; Chromatin; Chromosomes; Clinical; commercialization; cost; cost effectiveness; crosslink; design; Development; Digestion; Diploidy; Disease; DNA; DNA Sequence; Ensure; Epigenetic Process; Equipment; experience; experimental study; Forensic Medicine; functional genomics; Funding; Gene Expression; Genetic; genetic information; Genetic Research; Genome; Genomic DNA; Genomic medicine; Genomics; Genotype; Growth; Haplotypes; Health; Human; Human Chromosomes; Human Genetics; Human Genome; improved; Industry; innovation; Length; Ligation; Link; Liquid substance; Marketing; Measures; Medical Genetics; Metagenomics; Methodology; Methods; Microbial Genetics; Molecular Conformation; next generation; next generation sequencing; Performance; personalized medicine; Pharmacogenomics; Phase; precision medicine; Preparation; Price; programs; Protocols documentation; prototype; Reaction; Reading; Reagent; reconstitution; Research; research and development; restriction enzyme; Robot; Sales; Scientist; Shipping; Ships; skills; Speed; success; Technology; Testing; Time; United States National Institutes of Health; Untranslated RNA; user-friendly; Variant; ","Commercialization of a low-cost user-friendly DNA preparation kit that produces chromosome-span contiguity from conventional short-read sequencing?? for a wide range of applications","009584","ZHG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","","","848530",""

Gene expression involves an initiation event, followed by a pause ? the pause must then be released, like the brake on a car. This release process is disrupted in many blood diseases. We propose to study the pause release mechanism with a method that uses zebrafish genetics. Specific drugs added to the water also that release the brake: we will evaluate how these drugs work. Other factors open (or unravel) the DNA: we will evaluate zebrafish with mutations in these factors to understand such interactions. Our studies should lead to new strategies for treating patients with a variety of blood diseases. A surprising result of our current work is that transcriptional pausing can be regulated by drug treatments, and manipulation of pausing by compounds could open a new avenue for therapies. This proposal will define new mechanisms of gene expression in blood cells, and this information will be used to define drugs that activate specific blood genes. A mission of NHLBI is to treat diseases such as sickle cell anemia and thalassemia. The drugs could be active in the treatment of these diseases. To date, little is known about transcription pausing in the heart and lung. This platform and technology could form the basis for an understanding of transcription in these organs.","1882868; ","ZON, LEONARD IRA;","QASBA, PANKAJ ","","","abstracting; activating transcription factor; Address; Affect; Affinity; Anemia; B-Lymphocytes; base; Biochemical Genetics; Biochemistry; Blood; Blood Cells; chemical genetics; Chemicals; Chromatin; chromatin immunoprecipitation; Clinical; Clofibrate; Complex; Defect; Development; Developmental Biology; Diamond-Blackfan anemia; Disease; DNA; DNA Polymerase II; Elongation Factor; Erythrocytes; Erythroid; erythroid differentiation; Erythropoiesis; Erythropoietin; Evaluation; Event; Gene Expression; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Models; Genetic Programming; Genetic Screening; Genetic Transcription; Goals; Growth Factor; Heart; Hematological Disease; Hematopoiesis; Hormones; Human; insight; knock-down; Knockout Mice; Lead; Leflunomide; Lung; Marrow; Mass Spectrum Analysis; Mediating; meetings; Methods; Mission; mutant; Mutate; Mutation; Myelopoiesis; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; novel therapeutics; Nuclear; Nuclear Hormone Receptors; Nuclear Receptors; Organ; Partner in relationship; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacotherapy; Phosphotransferases; PPAR alpha; Process; programs; RNA Polymerase II; Role; Sickle Cell Anemia; Signal Pathway; SXR receptor; Technology; Testing; Thalassemia; Time; Transcript; Transcription Elongation; transcription factor; Transcriptional Regulation; transcriptome sequencing; Water; Work; Zebrafish; zebrafish development; ","Project 3 Control of Erythroid Differentiation by Transcription Elongation, Leonard I.

The goal of this project is to characterize the regulation of this reward learning mechanism, define its contribution to cocaine self-administration, and validate it as a potential target to enhance extinction of drug seeking and taking behavior, so that new treatments for addiction may be developed.","1870467; ","BIBB, JAMES A;","SORENSEN, ROGER ","05/15/2012","04/30/2017","","NMDA Receptor Regulation in Addiction","033485","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","06","119479","57947","177426",""

More than any other breast cancer, lobular breast cancers occur in both breasts and at multiple locations. Currently, breast MRI is considered the best imaging modality for evaluating if lobular breast cancer is present in both breasts and its location(s), and determining the size or extent of the cancer. However for 26% of the tumors, the size estimated by MRI differs from pathology after surgery by more than 1 cm. Improving the accuracy of tumor size estimate is important to determine if the patient is eligible for treatment that conserves the non-cancerous breast tissue. Dedicated breast computed tomography (CT) provides much higher spatial resolution than MRI. It does not require breast compression and each scan takes 10 seconds. Hence in this research, the ability of contrast-enhanced breast CT to provide more accurate estimate of tumor size than contrast-enhanced breast MRI will be investigated.","7928407; ","VEDANTHAM, SRINIVASAN ;","HENDERSON, LORI A.","04/01/2017","03/31/2018","Address; Algorithms; Bilateral; Breast; breast imaging; Breast-Conserving Surgery; Clinic; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials; clinically relevant; Contralateral Breast; contrast enhanced; design; Diagnosis; Disease; Evaluation; Excision; Health; Histopathology; Image; Image Analysis; image guided intervention; imaging modality; improved; Inferior; infiltrating duct carcinoma; interest; Ipsilateral; Lesion; Lobular; Lobular Carcinoma; Location; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; malignant breast neoplasm; Malignant Neoplasms; Mammary Gland Parenchyma; Mammary Ultrasonography; Mammography; Manuals; Mastectomy; Measurement; Medical Oncology; Meta-Analysis; Methods; Modality; Motion; Operative Surgical Procedures; Organ; Outcome; Pathology; Patients; Performance; Phase; prospective; radiologist; Radiology Specialty; Reference Standards; Research; Research Personnel; Resolution; Scanning; Surgical Oncology; Surgical Pathology; Techniques; Three-Dimensional Imaging; tumor; Tumor Volume; Ultrasonography; Woman; X-Ray Computed Tomography; ","Reducing mastectomy rates in invasive lobular carcinoma by high-resolution 3D breast CT","195512","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","03","126225","67530","193755",""
