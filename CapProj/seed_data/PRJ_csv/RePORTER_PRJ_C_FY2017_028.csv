Hemolysis-induced platelet activation is associated with PH, but the mechanism(s) by which 1) hemolysis causes platelet activation and 2) platelets contribute to PH is unknown. This project will test a putative pathway by which hemolytic components activate platelets through the production of oxidants to release a platelet factor (thrombospondin-1) which directly causes injury to the vasculature to promote PH in SCD. We will also test specific pharmacologic agents to block this putative pathway in a murine model of SCD-PH to determine whether these agents could be used clinically to attenuate PH pathogenesis in SCD patients.","9621121; ","SHIVA, SRUTI ;","KLAUZINSKA, MALGORZATA ","04/05/2017","01/31/2021","Acute; Adult; Antibodies; Antioxidants; Attenuated; base; Bioenergetics; Blocking Antibodies; Blood; Blood Platelet Antagonists; Blood Platelets; Blood Vessels; Bone Marrow; Cause of Death; CD47 gene; Cell model; Chimera organism; Clinical Trials; Coculture Techniques; Complement; Data; Development; Disease; effective therapy; endothelial dysfunction; Endothelium; Enzymes; Event; experimental study; Future; Glycoproteins; Heme; Hemoglobin; Hemolysis; Hereditary Disease; Human; Hypoxia; In Vitro; in vivo; in vivo Model; Infusion procedures; Injury; Link; Lung; Measures; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; Membrane Potentials; Microfluidic Analytical Techniques; Microfluidics; Mitochondria; mitochondrial membrane; Molecular; mortality; mouse model; Mus; mutant; Myography; Nitric Oxide; novel; oligomycin sensitivity-conferring protein; Oxidants; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidative Phosphorylation; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Patients; Phase II Clinical Trials; Phenotype; Plasma; Platelet Activation; pressure; prevent; Process; Production; Pulmonary artery structure; Pulmonary Hypertension; Reactive Oxygen Species; receptor; receptor-mediated signaling; research clinical testing; Sampling; Scheme; Sickle Cell Anemia; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Smooth Muscle Myocytes; targeted treatment; Testing; therapeutic target; Thrombosis; Thrombospondin 1; TLR4 gene; Transgenic Mice; Transgenic Organisms; Vascular Diseases; vascular endothelial dysfunction; vasoconstriction; ","Heme-induced platelet mtROS drives TSP1 release to accelerate PH pathogenesis","133003","RIBT","Respiratory Integrative Biology and Translational Research Study Section ","","A1","01","250000","136710","386710",""

The factors that hinder the protection of young children against infections are not known. Furthermore, HIV-uninfected children born to HIV-infected mothers have an even higher vulnerability to infections than children born to uninfected mothers. In this study, we will investigate a mechanism called immune regulation that controls immune responses to infections and vaccines to determine its effect on the immune responses of HIV-exposed and unexposed children in their first year of life. Immune regulation is heavily influenced by the gut flora, which differs in HIV-infected and uninfected individuals. In turn, infant gut flora is influenced by maternal flora. Therefore, we will study the gut flora of the infants in this study to determine if it is related to their immune regulation and responses to vaccines. Gut flora is modulated by the type of food that each individual ingests, so it can be potentially altered by adjusting the eating habits of the infants and their mothers.","8911467; 2134021 (contact); ","MADHI, SHABIR A; WEINBERG, ADRIANA  (contact);","MILLER, JUDITH A.","04/04/2017","03/31/2022","Accounting; Address; Adult; Antibody Response; Antigens; Attenuated Live Virus Vaccine; Attenuated Vaccines; BCG Vaccine; Biodiversity; Birth; Cessation of life; Child; Childhood; Chronic; Data; Defect; Development; Diet Habits; Environment; enzyme linked immunospot assay; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Epigenetic Process; Exposure to; Flow Cytometry; Food; Frequencies; gut microbiome; gut microbiota; high risk; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; HIV; HIV Infections; HIV-1; HIV-exposed uninfected infant; Hospitalization; Human; Immune; Immune response; Immune system; Immune System Diseases; immunogenicity; Immunology; in utero; Incidence; Individual; Infant; Infection; Infectious Disease Epidemiology; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Inherited; insight; Interleukin-10; Life; Measles Vaccine; Measures; Metapneumovirus; Methylation; microbial; Microbiology; microbiome; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Mothers; neonatal immune system; neonate; Parainfluenza; Perinatal Exposure; Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell; Postpartum Period; Pregnant Women; prognostic; Regulation; Regulatory T-Lymphocyte; Resistance; Respiratory syncytial virus; response; Ribosomal RNA; rRNA Genes; Scientist; Site; South Africa; Taxon; Time; Umbilical Cord Blood; Vaccine Design; Vaccines; Viral Vaccines; Virus Diseases; young adult; ","Tregs, Gut Microbiome and Immune Responses in HIV-Exposed and Unexposed Infants","131360","ZAI1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","310104","108784","418888",""

The pediatric enteral feeding world market is expected to grow to $108 million in 2020 from $73 million in 2013. PG tube placement however, often is associated with complications such as infection, tube clogging and poor stoma formation. Sharklet Technologies Inc., with outstanding preliminary results from Phase I SBIR efforts, proposes a continuing Phase II project to validate the efficacy and scale up development of the Sharklet pediatric PG device that will significantly reduce risks of PG-associated infection and tube clogging, as well as will improve stoma formation. The potential commercialization potential is high as this novel PG device prevents complications described above without any additional chemical, providing an efficacious while safe option for children.","10938362; ","MANN, ETHAN E.;","TAMBURRO, ROBERT F.","04/15/2016","03/31/2019","Abdomen; Address; Adherence; adult nutrition; Anti-Infective Agents; Area; Bacterial Attachment Site; base; Biocompatible Materials; Biomedical Engineering; Businesses; Caring; cell motility; Chemicals; Chemistry; Child; Childhood; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials; Collaborations; commercialization; cooking; cost; design; Development; Device Designs; Devices; Dimensions; disability; Disease; economic cost; Ensure; Enteral; Enteral Feeding; Enteral Nutrition; Epithelial Cells; Equipment Malfunction; expectation; experience; Extravasation; Family suidae; feeding; Funding; Gastrostomy; Generations; Goals; Healed; healing; high risk infant; Hospitals; Human; implantation; improved; In Vitro; in vitro testing; industry partner; Infection; innovation; instrument; interest; Investments; Lead; Legal patent; Letters; Liquid substance; lot production; Manufacturer Name; Marketing; Medical; Medical Device; meetings; Methods; microbial; Microbial Biofilms; Mission; Modeling; Morbidity - disease rate; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development; Neonatal; novel; nutrition; Nutritional status; Oral; Pathway interactions; Patients; pediatric patients; Performance; performance tests; Phase; phase 1 study; Phase II Clinical Trials; Poisons; Population; post-market; pre-clinical; prevent; Prevention; Process; product development; Public Health; Regulation; Research; Research Methodology; response; Risk; Safety; safety testing; scale up; Shark; Silicones; skills; Skin; Small Business Innovation Research Grant; Staging; Stomach; Stomas; success; Surface; System; Technology; Testing; Thick; Trauma; Traumatic injury; Tube; Validation; verification and validation; Work; Wound Healing; ","Micropatterned surfaces for minimizing pediatric gastrostomy tube complications","085616","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","","","786765",""

The most common form of urinary incontinence is stress urinary incontinence (SUI), which greatly reduces quality of life and, among female veterans is significantly correlated with a history of depression and sexual assault. Improvement of incontinence symptoms may help lead to recovery from depression. Women are the fastest growing segment of the veteran population, representing 14% of active duty forces and 20% of new military recruits, and are a priority of the VA research program. This research also directly relates to the Rehabilitation R&D Priority Area of Aging since SUI is a problem of the aging female veteran population. In addition, this work has application to other traumatic muscle and nerve injuries and could provide a method of improving rehabilitation from these combinatorial injuries for which recovery is difficult.

Many meniscal injuries are treated by meniscectomies, and this procedure is almost invariably followed by osteoarthritis-degenerative arthritis in that joint, with resultant severe disability. Current methods of meniscal repair are clearly inadequate, and we need better approaches to this. Our studies of combined gene therapy and tissue engineering will lead to improve- ments in meniscal injury repair.

Finally, the proposed study will provide clear direction to clinicians and patients as to which changes in muscle properties are most devastating for implementation of activities of daily living with the paretic upper extremity. Thisis expected to lead to changes in the type of future clinical interventions that will be implemented to reduce or eliminate maladaptive changes in upper extremity skeletal muscles following stroke.","1974015 (contact); 11506971; ","DEWALD, JULIUS P (contact); MURRAY, WENDY M;","CRUZ, THERESA ","06/01/2015","03/31/2019","Activities of Daily Living; Address; Affect; Age; Architecture; Area; arm; arm function; arm movement; arm paresis; base; biomechanical model; Brachial Paresis; Brain; Chronic; chronic stroke; Clinical; cohort; Contracture; Contralateral; Coupled; Coupling; Data; design; Development; disability; Eating; Elbow; Elbow joint structure; experience; Fascicle; Fatty acid glycerol esters; Finger joint structure; Fingers; Flexor; functional disability; Future; Generations; grasp; Hand; Hand functions; Health; hemiparetic stroke; Hygiene; Impairment; in vivo; Individual; Infiltration; Intervention; Isometric Exercise; joint stiffness; Joints; Lead; Length; Lifting; Limb structure; Link; Literature; Long-Term Effects; Lower Extremity; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Measurement; Measures; Mechanics; Methods; Microscopy; Mission; Modeling; Motion; motor impairment; Movement; Muscle; Muscle function; Musculoskeletal; Musculoskeletal System; neuroregulation; novel; Outcome; Paresis; Patients; Pattern; Physiological; Posture; prevent; Property; Public Health; Publishing; Recovery; Rehabilitation therapy; relating to nervous system; Research; Rest; Role; Sarcomeres; Signal Transduction; simulation; Skeletal Muscle; spasticity; standard measure; Sterile coverings; stroke; stroke survivor; Techniques; Testing; Time; tool; two-photon; Ultrasonography; Upper Extremity; Work; Wrist; Wrist joint; ","Motor impairment related changes in muscles properties in chronic stroke","084009","MABS","Modeling and Analysis of Biological Systems Study Section ","","","03","295387","90931","386318",""

The expansion of biotechnology frontiers require contributions by veterinary scientists capable of evaluating whole animal health issues while being expert, or at least conversant, with the rapidly evolving technologies. We believe our proposed training grant (second competitive renewal) ?Georgia Veterinary Scholars Summer Research Program? will make veterinary students more aware of and likely to pursue careers in research. Such veterinary research scientists will then be particularly well equipped to identify unique features of various animal models of human disease, to advance studies in translational medicine and animal health, to navigate the interface of animal and ecological health, and to be leaders in public health.","7113699; ","SANCHEZ, SUSAN ;","WATSON, HAROLD L.","04/01/2006","03/31/2022","abstracting; animal cloning; Animal Model; Animal Welfare; Animals; Area; Biology; Biomedical Research; biomedical scientist; career; college; Communication; Communities; comparative; design; Development; Discipline; Emerging Communicable Diseases; Environment; Ethics; Exercise; experience; Exposure to; Food Safety; Fostering; frontier; Future; Grant; Health; human disease; Imagination; Journals; Medical; Medical Device; Mentors; Oral; pre-doctoral; programs; Public Health; Recruitment Activity; Research; Research Personnel; responsible research conduct; Role; Schools; Site Visit; skills; student mentoring; Student recruitment; Students; summer program; summer research; Thinking; Time; Training; Transgenic Organisms; translational medicine; Universities; Veterinarians; Veterinary Medicine; Writing; ","Georgia Veterinary Scholars Summer Research Program","010433","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","11","70298","5624","75922",""

Knee OA is common among Veterans and is a leading cause of disability. The earliest stages of OA development, where the joint cartilage wears away, is usually painless. By the time Veterans experience symptoms, the OA is typically advanced and there is nothing that can be done except palliation until the joint is replaced with metal and plastic. If there was a blood test to provide early warning of cartilage wear and joint deterioration, Veterans could potentially be treated early enough to slow down or even prevent OA. So far, development of such a blood test has proved elusive. We propose a new method to amplify the signs of cartilage wear in the blood by challenging the affected joint with a walking task. Similar to a cardiac stress test, this  walking challenge may help to separate joints at risk from healthy joints. We will also see if this  `OA stress test' can show if a simple and inexpensive load-modifying shoe can improve joint health in Veterans with early knee OA.","1943257; ","CHU, CONSTANCE R;","","12/01/2015","11/30/2017","Affect; Age; Arthroscopy; articular cartilage; base; Biological; Biological Adaptation; Biological Markers; biomarker development; Blood; Blood Tests; bone; bone loss; bone turnover; Cardiology; Caregivers; Cartilage; Cartilage Matrix; Clinical; Clinical Data; clinical practice; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials Design; cohort; cost effective; Data; Degenerative polyarthritis; Deterioration; Development; Diagnosis; Diagnosis Clinical Trials; disability; Disease; Distress; Early Diagnosis; Early identification; Early treatment; Evaluation; experience; General Population; Goals; Health; high risk; human subject; Image Analysis; improved; Incidence; Individual; Intervention; joint destruction; Joints; Knee; Knee joint; Knee Osteoarthritis; knee pain; Knee Prosthesis; knee replacement arthroplasty; Lead; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; mammalian COMP; Maps; Measurable; Measures; Mechanics; Medial; Medicine; meetings; Metabolic; Metals; Methods; Military Personnel; Mission; Modeling; Modification; Nerve; Noise; novel; novel strategies; novel therapeutics; Organ; Outcome; Outcome Measure; Pain; Painless; palliation; Pathology; Patients; Persons; Population; premature; prevent; Preventive treatment; Process; Prospective Studies; Protocols documentation; public health relevance; Recruitment Activity; Rehabilitation therapy; Research Design; response; response biomarker; Response to stimulus physiology; Rest; Risk; Serum; Serum Markers; service member; Shoes; Signal Transduction; Staging; Stimulus; Stress Tests; Structure; success; successful intervention; Symptoms; Techniques; Testing; Thallium Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Stress Test; Time; Treatment outcome; treatment response; Validation; Variant; Veterans; Walking; Work; ","A Novel Serum Biomarker Stress Test  for Detection of Early Osteoarthritis","002045","RRDS","Rehabilitation Research and Development SPiRE Program ","","","02","","","",""

However, conducting research on and developing quality improvement initiatives around asthma management at the population level is difficult, primarily due to the inconsistent identification of who has asthma and who doesn't. Identification of asthma status from review of medical records is very time consuming and expensive. Thus, researchers and clinicians often use more easily available but potentially inconsistent ways to determine asthma status, such as review of diagnostic billing codes. This results in varied cohorts of people defined as having asthma that are associated with inconsistent study outcomes in asthma such as risk of asthma or asthma control. We will use natural language processing, a computer based search of electronic medical records (clinical notes), to efficiently determine who has asthma, what kind of asthma, and the onset of recognizable asthma symptoms that identify asthma efficiently, accurately, and consistently. An algorithm that robustly ascertains the status of asthma, and by extension possibly other chronic diseases, will accelerate scientific discoveries on asthma, enhance translation of research findings into clinical practice, and ultimately improve patient care.","6978650 (contact); 8644647; ","JUHN, YOUNG J (contact); LIU, HONGFANG ;","FREEMER, MICHELLE M","04/01/2015","03/31/2018","Address; Adult; Algorithms; Asthma; Attention; base; Biological Markers; Birth; Caring; Child; Childhood; Childhood Asthma; Chronic; Chronic Disease; Clinic; Clinical; clinical care; Clinical Data; Clinical Decision Support Systems; clinical practice; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials; Code; cohort; Cohort Studies; Computerized Medical Record; Computers; Confusion; cost; Data; Databases; Development; Diagnosis; Diagnostic; Disease; Electronic Health Record; Epidemiology; epidemiology study; Evaluation; evidence based guidelines; Future; Genetic study; genome wide association study; Goals; Gold; Health; Heterogeneity; ICD-9; improved; indexing; Information Retrieval; International Classification of Disease Codes; Investigation; Laboratories; longitudinal dataset; Manuals; Medical Records; meetings; Methods; Morbidity - disease rate; Natural Language Processing; Outcome; outcome forecast; Outcome Study; Patient Care; Patients; Play; Population; population based; Population Study; Process; Records; Reproducibility; Research; Research Personnel; Respiratory physiology; Risk; Role; Sampling; Sensitivity and Specificity; Site; Societies; Software Tools; Specific qualifier value; Specificity; Structure; Subgroup; Symptoms; System; Techniques; Testing; Text; Time; tool; Translational Research; Translations; United States; Variant; Work; ","Asthma ascertainment and characterization through electronic health records","126667","IRAP","Infectious Diseases, Reproductive Health, Asthma and Pulmonary Conditions Study Section ","","","03","250000","127370","377370",""

Breast cancer remains the second-leading cause of cancer deaths in women, and over 200,000 new cases of invasive breast cancer are expected in the USA this year alone. As suggested by The American Cancer Society, breast self-examination and clinical breast examination (palpation) are the most frequently used diagnostic tools for detecting breast abnormalities. It is known that cancerous masses are harder than the benign ones. Therefore, scientists have been trying to develop imaging tools that are sensitive to tissue stiffness. This research project is about evaluating breast masses by a new method called 'Sub-Hertz Analysis of Visco-Elasticity (SAVE)', which is sensitive to breast stiffness and viscosity. This noninvasive method is based on ultrasound and is easy to use. The goal of this project is to test the new method on breast patients and determine if it can improve differentiation of cancerous and noncancerous breast masses.

That this effect occurred independent of weight loss raises the exciting possibility that exercise combined with weight loss could reduce OSA by at least 50% and have unique health benefits for OSA patients. Following screening and baseline assessments, 90 overweight veterans ages 18-60 years with OSA will be randomized to one of three 16- week treatments: (1) exercise training; (2) 10 % weight loss; and 3) exercise + weight loss.

Using mice that express a fluorescent marker in medium spiny neurons to allow bridging collaterals to be identified, we will examine whether bridging collaterals are also altered by changes in dopamine signaling caused by Parkinson's disease or by the development of levodopa-induced dyskinesia, the confirmation of which may have profound implications for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.","1882529; ","KANG, UN JUNG;","SIEBER, BETH-ANNE ","05/15/2016","03/31/2018","Address; Adverse effects; Agonist; Axon; Back; Basal Ganglia; base; Behavior; Behavioral; Cell Nucleus; Chronic; Corpus striatum structure; Denervation; density; Dependovirus; Development; Dopamine; Dopamine D1 Receptor; Dopamine D2 Receptor; dopaminergic neuron; Dose; DRD2 gene; Dyskinetic syndrome; Effectiveness; experimental study; Feasibility Studies; Future; Gait abnormality; Globus Pallidus; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Health; Hydroxydopamines; Immunohistochemistry; improved; Individual; interest; Involuntary Movements; L-DOPA induced dyskinesia; Label; Lesion; Levodopa; Limb structure; Measures; Mediator of activation protein; Modeling; Motor; motor deficit; Motor output; motor symptom; Movement; Mus; Nerve Degeneration; Neurons; optogenetics; Output; overexpression; Parkinson Disease; Parkinsonian Disorders; Pathway interactions; Pilot Projects; Play; promoter; response; Role; Severities; Signal Transduction; Staining method; Stains; Substantia nigra structure; Symptoms; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Uses; therapy development; Time; Transgenes; Transgenic Mice; Tremor; ","Plasticity of bridge collaterals in Parkinonian state and treatment","096494","CNNT","Clinical Neuroplasticity and Neurotransmitters Study Section ","","","02","45000","27000","72000",""

Ultimately, the goal of this research program is to develop more efficient and effective Transfusion Medicine related strategies for the benefit of the blood transfusion recipient.","1877656; ","SILBERSTEIN, LESLIE ERIC;","MONDORO, TRACI ","04/01/2009","03/31/2021","abstracting; Animal Husbandry; Animals; Antibodies; Bacterial Infections; base; Blood Cells; Blood Platelets; blood product; Blood Transfusion; Bone Marrow; Bone Marrow Transplantation; Breeding; CD34 gene; Cell Therapy; Cells; Chromatin; Clinical; clinical practice; Clinical Sciences; Collaborations; combat; Complex; cost effective; CXCL12 gene; Cytometry; design; Disease; empowered; Engraftment; Ensure; Enzymes; Epigenetic Process; Erythrocytes; Event; experience; Faculty; Flow Cytometry; Frequencies; Functional disorder; Glues; Goals; granulocyte; Hematopoiesis; Hematopoietic; hematopoietic cell transplantation; improved; Infection; Inflammation; Inflammatory; inflammatory modulation; innovation; inositol heptakisphosphate; insight; Investigation; Joints; Knockout Mice; Laser Scanning Cytometry; Lead; Link; Marrow; Medical; medical schools; Medicine; Molecular; multidisciplinary; Mycoses; Natural regeneration; novel therapeutic intervention; operation; Outcome; Pancytopenia; Pathway interactions; Patients; Performance; phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate; Platelet Transfusion; Principal Investigator; Process; Production; Productivity; programs; Property; Public Health; quantitative imaging; Reagent; Recording of previous events; Recovery; Repression; Research; Research Project Grants; Resources; Role; Signal Transduction; Specialist; Specific qualifier value; stem; Stem cell transplant; Stem cells; Stress; Stromal Cells; Sum; Technology; Testing; therapeutic target; Therapeutic Uses; Tissues; trait; transcription factor; Transcriptional Regulation; Transfusion; Transgenic Mice; Translating; Transplantation; United States National Institutes of Health; Yeasts; Zinc Fingers; ","Molecular Mechanisms of Blood Cell Transfusion","095489","HLBP","Heart, Lung, and Blood Initial Review Group ","","","07","1347764","647149","1994913",""

The factors contributing to the emergence of tics may involve maladaptive sensory processing and inhibitory control of motor output, both of which depend on intact GABAergic function in sensorimotor cortex. To date, most studies focus primarily on the motor system in older teens and adults and thus fail to capture factors key to the emergence of severe symptoms. This has hindered the development of highly effective treatments. In this multi-PI proposal, the investigators bring complementary expertise to recruit a scientifically relevant, substantial population of children during a period where TS symptoms are developing in order to evaluate clinical symptoms, sensory discrimination and adaptation, motor cortex inhibitory physiology using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, and GABA in sensory motor cortex and supplementary motor areas using Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy. The purpose of this study is to quantify GABAergic sensorimotor dysfunction in TS and correlate this with sensory function, motor physiology, and clinical symptoms in ways that will direct us to more effective childhood TS treatments that prevent adult complications.","6709049; 1865949 (contact); ","GILBERT, DONALD L; MOSTOFSKY, STEWART H.

If the cell loses the ability to selectively send essential cargo to the proper dendrites and axons, the neurons will not be able to properly communicate and eventually die, a characteristic on many neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, understanding the fundamental mechanisms that contribute to segregation of cargo within neuronal processes and these mechanisms role in the maintenance of neural processes in the brain is critical for finding a successful treatment for many neurological disorders. In this study, we look at a novel protein complex, composed of the CRMP2, KLC4, and CLN6 proteins, which we hypothesize allows for shipment of cellular cargo to the distal sites in axons and/or dendrites that is essential for the maintenance of these processes and without which the processes become unstable, synapses disappear, and the processes degenerate.","7864776; ","WEIMER, JILL M;","MORRIS, JILL A","04/01/2014","03/31/2019","Axon; base; Behavior; Binding; Binding Proteins; Biological; Biological Models; Brain; Cell physiology; Cells; Cerebral cortex; Characteristics; CLN6 protein; collapsin response mediator protein-2; Complex; Data; Dendrites; design; Development; Disease; Distal; Docking; drug development; Dyes; Electroporation; Enzymes; Esters; Event; Family; Figs - dietary; Future; Genes; Genetic; glial activation; Glutamates; Growth; Health; Human; Imagery; imaging modality; improved; in utero; in vivo; infancy; Interneurons; Intracellular Transport; Jansky-Bielschowsky Disease; Kinesin; Kinetics; Knowledge; lanthionine; Lead; Light; Link; live cell imaging; Longevity; Maintenance; member; Membrane; Membrane Proteins; Messenger RNA; Microscopy; Microtubules; Molecular; Motor; mouse model; Movement; Mutant Strains Mice; Mutation; Natural regeneration; Nerve Degeneration; nerve stem cell; nervous system disorder; Neurites; Neurodegenerative Disorders; neurodevelopment; Neurologic; neuron development; neuronal cell body; Neuronal Ceroid-Lipofuscinosis; Neuronal Differentiation; neuronal survival; Neurons; novel; novel therapeutics; Organelles; Pathogenesis; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Patients; pre-clinical; Process; programs; protein complex; Proteins; Proteomics; relating to nervous system; Research Personnel; response; Role; segregation; Signal Transduction; Site; small hairpin RNA; Specificity; Speed; Structure; Synapses; Testing; Therapeutic; Time; To specify; Toxic effect; trafficking; Transport Vesicles; Variant; Vesicle; Vesicle Transport Pathway; ","Novel mechanisms for distal transport in developing and mature neurons","082283","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","04","231727","78788","310515",""

We have found that diabetes appears to impair regulation of this gene in humans and in rodents such that its expression is blunted in muscles with poor blood flow.

This problem might be even worse among veterans given that the frequency of depressive symptoms is 2 to 5 times higher than among the general US population. This situation put a high burden on patients with depression due to worsening quality of life and increasing health care costs. A breakthrough discovery happened in recent years when investigators found that a single infusion from an old anesthetic named ketamine showed high efficacy and rapid antidepressant effect (within hours) but lasted only up to a week. We propose to study if multiple infusions of ketamine have greater antidepressant effects than one infusion. If that is the case, multiple infusions could help depressed veterans that do not response to common antidepressant drugs.","12032687; ","SHIROMA, PAULO R.;","","04/01/2015","03/31/2019","accomplished suicide; Acute; Adverse effects; Adverse event; Affinity; Agonist; Alcohols; Anesthesia procedures; Anesthetics; antidepressant effect; Antidepressive Agents; Anxiety; Barbiturates; base; Behavioral; Bipolar Depression; Bipolar Disorder; Cessation of life; Characteristics; Clinic; Clinical Trials; Cognitive; Data; Depressed mood; depressed patient; depressive symptoms; Discipline of Nursing; Disease; Disease remission; Dose; Drug Kinetics; effective therapy; Eligibility Determination; Evaluation; Event; Exclusion Criteria; Failure; Female; follow-up; Frequencies; functional disability; Glutamate Receptor; Goals; Health; health administration; Health Care Costs; hemodynamics; Hour; hypomania; improved; indexing; Infusion procedures; Intervention; Interview; Intravenous; Intravenous Anesthetics; Intravenous infusion procedures; Ketamine; Life; Major Depressive Disorder; male; Manic; Measures; Medical; Mental Depression; Mental Health; Midazolam; Military Personnel; Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors; N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors; N-Methylaspartate; Names; novel; Outcome; Pain intensity; Parkinson's Dementia; Participant; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase; Pilot Projects; placebo controlled study; Placebos; Population; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders; Pregnancy; Prevalence; Procedures; Process; Psychotic Disorders; Quality of life; Randomized; Randomized Controlled Trials; Recruitment Activity; Registries; Relapse; Reporting; Research; Research Design; Research Personnel; response; Risk; Sampling; Schedule; screening; secondary outcome; Seizures; Severities; Staging; Substance Use Disorder; suicidal; suicidal risk; Symptoms; Telephone; Testing; Time; Traumatic Brain Injury; treatment duration; treatment responders; treatment-resistant depression; trial comparing; Unipolar Depression; Veterans; Visit; ","Intravenous Sub-anesthetic Ketamine Treatment in Treatment-Resistant Depression","001191","CLNA","Clinical Trials - A ","","","03","","","",""

We have developed a strategy to identify biomarkers that are present in the blood of patients with pancreatic cancer but not benign pancreatic diseases. A non-invasive biomarker assay could be applied as a screening test to patients at high risk for pancreatic cancer (e.g., patients with chronic pancreatitis, diabetes mellitus, or a strong family history of pancreatic cancer) or as a diagnostic test in patients with non-specific symptoms.

By understanding the energetics of a tissue, we can understand how that tissue is altered in disease states, and how it is improved with therapy. Gaining metabolic insights into how tissue functions allows us to appreciate how a disease is affecting a specific Veteran, and we can tailor therapy based on these individual differences. Inherent to this line of research is the consideration that not all diseases affect all Veterans similarly, and not all treatments work equally well in all Veterans.

These efforts require an interdisciplinary approach, with involvement of biomedical scientists, engineers, and clinical researchers. The central goal of this Training Program in tissue engineering and regeneration is to provide an interdisciplinary research-intensive environment for individuals who wish to pursue careers in the Oral Sciences, with a focus in the area of restoration of oral-craniofacial tissues.

These disorders cause considerable disability in vulnerable groups (adolescents, college students, and women) and there are no fully effective treatments. The development of such treatments would be of enormous benefit across multiple psychiatric disorders, especially in younger people for whom bingeing has not yet progressed to the level of an actual eating disorder or addiction. Our laboratory has discovered that mu-opioid peptides (small proteins that act at the same receptors as morphine) act within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of rats to produce behavioral effects that strikingly resemble bingeing. The PFC is a brain region important for impulse control and decision-making. We found that µ- opioids disrupt PFC function, causing abnormally high motivation to seek and consume food, and also engendering strong impulsivity in responding for food rewards. Importantly, a wide range of other PFC manipulations did not produce these features, suggesting that µ-opioids modulate the PFC in unique ways. Hence, studying µ-opioid actions in the PFC may reveal new ways to treat the psychiatric disorders listed above. In this proposal, we will thoroughly explore the neural circuit and mechanisms by which µ-opioids in the PFC cause binge-like behaviors. In the process, we will test an entirely new network model describing the way in which PFC-µ-opioids abnormally activate lower brain levels to cause bingeing. Finally, we will investigate whether there are sex differences in the function of this PFC-µ-opioid system. These studies may help to identify new ways to normalize PFC function and, at the same time, quell abnormal activity at lower brain levels, which could provide an unprecedented new treatment strategy for binge-type behaviors.","6146944; ","BALDO, BRIAN A;","ROSSI, ANDREW ","04/05/2005","03/31/2020","addiction; Adolescent; Affect; Agonist; Alcohol consumption; Amino Acids; AMPA Receptors; Amygdaloid structure; Appetitive Behavior; Area; Arousal; base; Behavior; Behavioral; Binge Eating; Binge eating disorder; binge type behavior; Biological Assay; Brain; Brain imaging; Brain region; Bulimia; Code; Decision Making; designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs; Development; disability; Disease; drug standard; Eating Disorders; effective therapy; Engineering; Estrogens; executive function; Exhibits; experimental study; Failure; Fatty acid glycerol esters; feeding; Feeding behaviors; Female; Food; Food Processing; frontal lobe; Funding; GABA Receptor; Gambling; gamma-Aminobutyric Acid; gender difference; Glutamates; GTP-Binding Proteins; Health; heuristics; Hyperactive behavior; hypocretin; Hypothalamic structure; Impairment; improved; Impulsivity; Individual; Investigation; Laboratories; Lateral; Ligands; Literature; Mediating; Mental disorders; monoamine; Morphine; motivated behavior; Motivation; motivational processes; Naltrexone; Narcotic Antagonists; network dysfunction; network models; neural circuit; neuroadaptation; neuromechanism; Neuronal Plasticity; Neurons; novel; Nucleus Accumbens; Opioid; Opioid Peptide; Opioid Receptor; orexin 1 receptor; Output; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacology; Pharmacotherapy; Phenotype; Population; Prefrontal Cortex; Prevalence; Process; Proteins; psychologic; Psychological reinforcement; Rattus; receptor; Receptor Signaling; response; Rewards; RNA Interference; Role; SB-334867; Sex Behavior; Sex Characteristics; Signal Transduction; Site; System; Testing; Time; transmission process; treatment strategy; university student; Virus; Vulnerable Populations; Woman; Work; ","Frontal cortical opioid modulation of striato-hypothalamic networks: roles in food-reward and impulsivity","074723","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","08","225000","115434","340434",""

Recent budget setbacks mean that EI-CO practitioners are pressed to ensure high quality care with limited resources. Hence, there is critical need for robust research evidence about the adequacy of EI services relative to functional outcomes to improve EI service delivery. However, limitations of current approaches to EI outcomes reporting have contributed to challenges in understanding how disparities in EI service use impact functional outcomes. Recent advances in technology have made it possible to more feasibly obtain valid and reliable patient-reported outcomes (PROs) data with which to fill this knowledge gap. This project leverages these advances in electronic patient-reported outcomes (PROs) to improve EI outcomes reporting, with an eye toward evaluating and improving quality care for young Coloradoan children with developmental disabilities and delays. For this project, we will 1) examine disparities in EI-CO service use based on programmatic data from a primary EI program serving families in the Denver-Metro catchment area (Aim 1) and 2) estimate the impact of EI-CO service use on relevant patient-reported functional outcomes (PROs) (Aim 2).","11699311 (contact); 9154969; ","KHETANI, MARY ALUNKAL (contact); MCMANUS, BETH MARIE;","QUATRANO, LOUIS A","04/01/2016","03/31/2018","Address; Affect; base; billing data; Budgets; Caring; Catchment Area; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Chronic; clinical decision-making; Colorado; Communities; community partnership; Complex; Data; Data Collection; data portal; Developmental Delay Disorders; Developmental Disabilities; disability; dosage; Dose; Down Syndrome; Early Intervention; Econometric Models; Electronics; Enrollment; Ensure; Eye; Family; Family Characteristics; Frequencies; functional outcomes; functional status; Funding; Future; Goals; Health; Home environment; Human; Impairment; improved; Infant; innovation; Intervention; Knowledge; Language Therapy; Link; Measures; Mediating; meetings; Methods; novel; Occupational Therapy; Outcome; Outcome Measure; Outcome Study; Outcomes Research; Patient Outcomes Assessments; Patients; Performance; Physical therapy; Policies; Population; programs; Protocols documentation; Provider; Quality of Care; Questionnaires; Rehabilitation therapy; Reporting; Research; Resources; response; scale up; Secure; Self Care; service utilization; Services; Site; skill acquisition; Source; Special Education; Speech Therapy; Task Performances; Technology; Testing; Time; Toddler; Translating; United States National Institutes of Health; ","Early Intervention Outcomes Research using Innovative Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) Measures","084909","CHHD","Biobehavioral and Behavioral Sciences Subcommittee ","","","02","56499","14544","71043",""

Patients remain with severe facial soft tissue disability that includes impairments in movements, particularly facial expressive behaviors. We have demonstrated the utility of novel 3D dynamic and static quantitative (objective) measures that were validated for use in the cleft lip/palate patient population, and which provide a more precise diagnosis of the facial disability and evaluation of surgical outcomes. Thus, the main goal of this prospective, observational study is to determine the applicability of these novel 3D dynamic and static measures for quantification and measurement of impairment and disfigurement, as well as change over time, in patients with facial paralysis. Ultimately, we will generate novel, objective measures to characterize the condition and temporal changes, and generate future hypotheses to optimize interventions and assess the outcomes of the different treatments.","6390688; ","TROTMAN, CARROLL ANN;","GANNOT, GALLYA ","04/04/2016","03/31/2018","Acute; Affect; Age; age group; Antiviral Agents; Appearance; Area; Articulation; Autoimmune Diseases; base; Behavior; Bell Palsy; Benign; Chronic; cleft lip and palate; Clinical; Clinical assessments; Commissure; Contracture; Devices; Diagnosis; Dimensions; disability; Disability Evaluation; Ear Diseases; Ectropion; Elements; Emergency department visit; Emotional; Esthetics; Evaluation; Eye; Face; Facial asymmetry; Facial nerve structure; Facial paralysis; Fees; Frequencies; Future; Future Generations; Goals; Health; Health Care Costs; Housing; Image; Impairment; Intervention; Left; Legal patent; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Malignant Neoplasms; Matched Group; Measurement; Measures; Methods; Movement; Muscle; Nerve; novel; Observational Study; Operative Surgical Procedures; Oral; Outcome; Paralysed; Participant; patient population; Patients; Perception; Peripheral; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Physical therapy; Process; prospective; Ptosis; Qualitative Methods; Quality of life; reconstruction; Recovery; Rehabilitation therapy; Research; Severities; sex; Side; Smiling; social; soft tissue; Steroids; Surgeon; Syndrome; System; Testing; Time; Trauma; treatment planning; United States; United States National Institutes of Health; ","Function and Form Outcomes in Patients with Facial Paralysis","025295","ZDE1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","130269","58566","188835",""

The major pathology of VALI is caused by extensive deformation of the lung tissue beyond the normal tidal volume. VALI may develop in patients with or without pre-existing lung diseases, and the incidence and mortality rate of VALI are high. The only preventive and treatment measure for VALI is ventilation strategies to reduce tidal volume without substantial decrease in the gas exchange efficiency. Although it is known that injury to lung resident cells is important for the development of VALI symptoms, the mechanisms that help the repair process of lung cells are poorly understood. Here we show that MG53 may be an essential molecule that mediates membrane repair in lung tissue and supplementation of recombinant MG53 improves the ability of lung cells to repair membrane damage. In this project, we will further examine the mechanism of MG53-mediated membrane repair in lung epithelial cells and aim to test the potential of our recombinant protein-based therapy in the treatment of VALI. This project will help to understand the mechanism of VALI and to develop a targeted therapy in treating such lung injuries in clinic.","10629291; ","ZHAO, XIAOLI ;","REINECK, LORA A","07/08/2013","03/31/2018","Ablation; Acute; Acute Lung Injury; Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome; Alveolar Cell; Alveolar Cell Type I; Animal Model; base; Binding; Biological Assay; Breathing; cell injury; Cell membrane; Cell Survival; Cells; Clinic; Clinical; Complex; Cultured Cells; Defect; Development; Dose; Environmental air flow; Epithelial Cells; extracellular; Fluorescence; Functional disorder; Gases; Genetic; Goals; Health; Human body; Hypoxemia; improved; in vitro Model; in vivo; Incidence; injured; Injury; injury and repair; knock-down; Laboratories; large scale production; Lipids; live cell imaging; Lung; Lung diseases; lung injury; lung repair; Measures; Mechanical ventilation; Mechanics; Mediating; Membrane; Membrane Proteins; Methodology; Molecular; Molecular Weight; mortality; mouse model; Mus; Muscle Cells; Muscle Fibers; Organ Preservation; outcome forecast; overexpression; Pathology; Patients; Phosphatidylserines; Physicians; Pilot Projects; Plasma; Play; Predisposition; Preventive treatment; Process; Proteins; Recombinant Proteins; Recombinants; repaired; Research; response; Role; Route; Scientist; Signal Transduction; Site; Skeletal Muscle; small hairpin RNA; Staging; Stretching; Striated Muscles; Structure of parenchyma of lung; Supplementation; Symptoms; System; targeted treatment; Testing; Tidal Volume; Time; tissue repair; Transgenic Mice; uptake; Venous; Ventilator; Vesicle; Water; Western Blotting; Wild Type Mouse; Wound Healing; ","Targeting Membrane Repair in Deformation-Induced Lung Injury","116826","LIRR","Lung Injury, Repair, and Remodeling Study Section ","","","05","284312","132205","416517",""

The full complement of these genes constitutes the organism's genome. Furthermore the genome of each individual within a species varies slightly, thus providing the genetic basis of the many differences we see between individuals. The technology of DNA sequencing has allowed scientists to construct the shared genome sequence of humans and many species of plant and animal, providing powerful evidence for the evolutionary connections between species. Effort is now going into decoding the genetic differences between individuals within a species, particularly for individual humans and their susceptibility to disease. Many of these advances rely upon interactions between a diverse set of experts, ranging from engineers developing ever faster sequencing technologies, bioinformatics experts who handle the very large datasets generated by these machines, biologists who interpret the results in the context of known biology to shed new light on fundamental mechanisms, and medical experts who seek to apply this information to improved medical treatment and the development of novel therapeutic strategies. This annual conference is one of the major points of exchange for many scientists, editors and associated genome experts to share their latest findings, and provides rapid peer-to-peer communication and networking that is essential to drive the field forward.

A roadmap for achieving therapeutic myocardial regeneration exists in the remarkable capacity of the adult zebrafish heart to achieve near-complete regeneration following several forms of injury. In early 2014, our laboratory reported that partial resection of the zebrafish ventricle stimulates expression of Notch receptors in the endocardium and epicardium but not the myocardium. We also reported that ubiquitous inhibition of Notch signaling impairs regeneration by compromising cardiomyocyte proliferation. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that Notch signaling, induced by injury in the endocardium and epicardium, activates the production of an unidentified paracrine signal that stimulates cardiomyocyte proliferation. Despite preliminary support for this model, our hypothesis remains unproven. Our Specific Aims are designed to: 1) delineate the necessity and sufficiency of endocardial/epicardial Notch signaling for stimulating cardiomyocyte proliferation during heart regeneration, 2) dissect the role of chromatic remodeling in transcriptional activation of injury-induced loci, including notch1b, during zebrafish heart regeneration, and 3) identify Notch-targeted paracrine factors that stimulate cardiomyocyte proliferation during heart regeneration. Studies from other laboratories have documented active Notch signaling in the endocardium and epicardium of injured mammalian hearts where this pathway contributes to fibrosis/repair. Therefore, despite differential regenerative capacities, Notch signaling is a shared feature of the cardiac injury response across vertebrates. In the long run, deciphering the role of Notch signaling in zebrafish heart regeneration will inform therapeutic strategies for redirecting or repurposing activated Notch for clinical benefit.","1870790 (contact); 7870048; ","BURNS, C.

The second approach entails transfection of the CMSCs with the human sodium/iodide symporter (hNIS) gene, and in vivo tracking of the cells by PET imaging in conjunction with the iodide analog PET probe, 18F-tetrafluoroborate.

Once the vocal folds are scarred, there is little that ca be done to restore their vibration.

This project uses genetic and genomic approaches to uncover other genes that significantly alter the timing with which diagnosable symptoms become manifest in Huntington's disease patients. We have discovered definitive chromosomal locations of several such modifier genes and have suggestive evidence for the locations of many more. Using a combination of human HD disease patient sample collections, induced pluripotent stem cell lines and neuronal cells derived from them, and lines of mice that precisely replicate the human mutation, we will home in on the precise genes and DNA variants and, therefore, the biological pathways that influence the HTT CAG-initiated disease process that leads to onset of motor symptoms, cognitive impairment and psychiatric symptoms and will evaluate their effects in accurate model systems. We will thereby generate the knowledge and experimental resources to support therapeutic development for the first time based upon targets already validated to alter the rate of HD in humans.","1887138; ","GUSELLA, JAMES F;","MILLER, DANIEL L","04/01/2015","03/31/2020","Affect; Age; Age of Onset; Alleles; Appearance; base; Belief; Biological; Biological Assay; Biological Models; Biological Process; CAG repeat; Candidate Disease Gene; Cell Line; Cell model; Cells; Cessation of life; Characteristics; Chorea; chromosomal location; Chromosome Mapping; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4; Clinical; clinical Diagnosis; Code; Cognitive; Communities; cost; Data; Data Set; deep sequencing; Development; Diagnosis; Diagnostic; Disease; DNA; DNA Markers; drug development; drug discovery; effective therapy; European; Family; Foundations; Gene Expression; Gene Structure; Gene-Modified; Generations; Genes; Genetic; genetic approach; Genetic Models; genetic technology; Genetic Variation; Genome; genome wide association study; genome-wide; Genomic approach; Genotype; Goals; Grant; Haplotypes; Health; Home environment; Human; human disease; Human Genome; Huntington Disease; Huntington gene; Impaired cognition; in vivo; Individual; induced pluripotent stem cell; Inherited; Intervention; Investigation; Knock-in Mouse; Knowledge; Length; Location; lymphoblast; Maps; mind control; Modification; Molecular; Motor; motor symptom; mouse model; Mus; mutant; Mutation; Neurodegenerative Disorders; Neurons; new technology; novel; Onset of illness; Other Genetics; Palliative Care; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Patients; Persons; Pharmacologic Substance; Phenotype; Population; positional cloning; Positioning Attribute; premature; prevent; Process; Proteins; psychiatric symptom; Reagent; Regulation; Regulatory Element; Resources; Route; sample collection; screening; Series; Societies; Structure; Symptoms; Testing; Therapeutic; therapeutic development; Time; Tissues; tool; Translations; Ulysses Contracts; Variant; Vertebral column; Work; ","Disease-Modifying Genes in Huntington's Diseae","091161","MNG","Molecular Neurogenetics Study Section ","","","03","318421","230725","549146",""

Our proposal has the potential to decrease this barrier by demonstrating a novel mechanism based on the capacity of cPTH and iPTH to induce the differentiation of naïve CD4+ cells into two specific subsets of T cells known as Th17 cells and Tregs.

The expansion of the team-based design program will provide the opportunity for our clinical collaborators to sponsor the design-based problems and will afford the students exposure to clinical settings, identification of unmet clinical needs, and practical understanding of design constraints, ultimately preparing biomedical engineers for today's workforce.","7342621; ","HIGGINSON, JILL S;","ERIM, ZEYNEP ","04/15/2015","03/31/2020","Academy; Address; Awareness; base; bench to bedside; Biomedical Engineering; Biomedical Research; Biomedical Technology; career; Clinic; Clinical; clinical practice; clinical research site; collaborative environment; Communication; comparative; Complex; cost; Data; Degree program; Delaware; design; Development; Devices; Discipline; Education; educational atmosphere; Effectiveness; Electrical Engineering; Employment Opportunities; Engineering; Ensure; Environment; Ethical Issues; experience; Exposure to; Facility Designs; falls; Feedback; Foundations; Generations; Goals; Growth; Health; Health Sciences; Healthcare; human subject; Immersion Investigative Technique; improved; Income; Industry; Intellectual Property; Knowledge; Learning; mathematical sciences; Mechanics; Medicine; meetings; Nature; news; next generation; Occupations; Phase; posters; Problem Solving; Process; programs; prototype; rapid growth; Reporting; Research; satisfaction; skills; Solid; statistics; Students; success; Surveys; Technical Expertise; Technology; technology development; Time; Training; Translating; undergraduate student; Universities; Validation; Work; ","The value of practical design experience in biomedical engineering education","014790","ZEB1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","03","18000","1440","19440",""

Due to combat exposures, an even greater proportion (52.6%) of OEF/OIF/OND Veterans with epilepsy also had TBI, at 3 times the rate in civilian populations, underscoring the present and continuing importance of PTE to the VA. A period of years is often present between the TBI and the first seizure of PTE, during which a slowly evolving process induces permanent changes in the brain (epileptogenesis). Currently we are unavailable to detect epileptogenesis during this critical but clinically silent period, and no treatments are available. The goal of this project is to utilize a novel animal model of PTE to identify electrographic biomarkers of epileptogenesis, leading to improved diagnosis, and to survey molecular mechanisms underlying post-traumatic epileptogenesis, which will guide the development of therapeutics for this currently untreatable condition.","12309701; ","KOTLOSKI, ROBERT JOSEPH;","","04/01/2016","03/31/2021","Acute Brain Injuries; Amyloid beta-Protein; Animal Model; Animals; Appearance; Award; Biological Markers; biomarker development; Brain; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Breeding; career; career development; Caring; Clinic; Clinical; combat; Comorbidity; controlled cortical impact; Development; Diagnosis; Diagnostic; Disease; Doctor of Philosophy; educational atmosphere; Entropy; Environment; Epilepsy; Epileptogenesis; Equipment; Evaluation; Fellowship; forest; Frequencies; Funding; Genetic; Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein; Goals; Grant; Health; Health Expenditures; High Frequency Oscillation; Hour; Human; Immunoblotting; Immunohistochemistry; Impairment; improved; Individual; injured; Injury; innovation; instructor; Joints; Knowledge; Laboratories; Laboratory Research; Manuscripts; medical schools; Mentors; Molecular; mossy fiber; Neurologist; Neurology; neurophysiology; novel; Pattern; Population; Post-Traumatic Epilepsy; prevent; Preventive treatment; Process; protein expression; Quality of life; Rat Strains; Rattus; Research; Research Personnel; Research Project Grants; Research Training; Residencies; Residual state; Resistance; response; Seizures; skills; Sprague-Dawley Rats; Stimulus; Structure; Surveys; tau Proteins; Testing; Therapeutic; therapeutic development; therapeutic target; Time; Training Support; Traumatic Brain Injury; Universities; Variant; Veterans; Veterans Hospitals; Wisconsin; Work; Writing; ","TBI and posttraumatic epilepsy in plasticity susceptible and resistant rats","002986","NURB","Neurobiology B ","","","02","","","",""

This project would have clear relevance and impact to affect this significant mental health problem by determining whether reducing prenatal maternal depressive symptoms affects the development of infant mechanisms that contribute to risk for psychopathology later in life; this knowledge would provide clear translational impact on when, where, and how to intervene, as well as identify infant risk mechanisms that could become the targets for later intervention development among at-risk offspring.","8149725 (contact); 7031716; ","DAVIS, ELYSIA POGGI (contact); HANKIN, BENJAMIN L;","GARVEY, MARJORIE A","04/07/2017","03/31/2022","abstracting; Affect; Age; American; Amygdaloid structure; Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; Area; Attention; base; Behavior; behavior observation; Birth; Brain; brain circuitry; Brain region; Child; Child Development; Child Mental Health; Childhood; Cognitive; cognitive control; cognitive system; Communities; connectome; Data; Depressed mood; depressive symptoms; design; Development; Disease; Emotional; ethnic diversity; experience; Exposure to; Eye; fetal; Fetus; Fiber; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Hippocampus (Brain); Hydrocortisone; Impairment; improved; infancy; Infant; Infant Development; infant outcome; innovation; interpersonal therapy; Intervention; Knowledge; Lead; Life; Lifetime Risk; Link; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Maternal Behavior; maternal depression; Measures; Medical center; meetings; Mental Depression; Mental Health; Meta-Analysis; Mood Disorders; National Institute of Mental Health; Negative Valence; Neurologic; Observational Study; Occupational; offspring; Outcome; Perinatal Exposure; Physiology; Postpartum Period; Prefrontal Cortex; Pregnancy; pregnant; Pregnant Women; prenatal; Process; Psychopathology; Public Health; Randomized; Randomized Clinical Trials; Recording of previous events; Recovery; Recruitment Activity; Regulation; Reporting; Research; Research Domain Criteria; Rest; Risk; Risk Factors; social; socioeconomics; Structure; System; Testing; therapy development; Thick; treatment as usual; white matter; Woman; ","Reducing Fetal Exposure to Maternal Depression to Improve Infant Risk Mechanisms","109662","MESH","Biobehavioral Mechanisms of Emotion, Stress and Health Study Section ","","A1","01","541321","223883","765204",""

For example, rates of TB in Iraq and Afghanistan are 16- and 45-fold higher than in the U.S., respectively, and management of TB risk is a major challenge for military public health. The global emergence of drug-resistant forms of TB makes this risk even greater. Military occupational exposures are a CSR&D priority research area. This proposal aims to develop new biomarkers for TB which would enhance veteran health for several reasons. New TB drugs are urgently needed to shorten treatment and treat drug resistance but clinical trials are held back by lack of an early marker for treatment failure. A new marker would change the clinical trial landscape and could also be used to monitor individual patients. An additional aim is validating a new form of host-pathogen interaction through RNA interference. If confirmed, this mechanism could provide new targets for therapy.","10806822; ","WALTER, NICHOLAS D;","","04/01/2014","03/31/2019","3' Untranslated Regions; active method; Afghanistan; Antitubercular Agents; Area; Back; base; Binding; Biological Markers; Biological Process; biomarker evaluation; Blood; Bronchoalveolar Lavage; Cell Line; cell type; Cells; Clinical; clinical care; Clinical Trials; clinically relevant; cohort; Communities; comparison group; Conflict (Psychology); Country; Data; Disease; Drug resistance; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profile; Genes; Genetic Transcription; Granulomatous; Health; high throughput screening; Human; Immune response; Immunity; improved; Incidence; individual patient; Infection; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Intention; Iraq; Lung; macrophage; Messenger RNA; Microarray Analysis; Military Personnel; Molecular; Molecular Profiling; Monitor; Monitoring Clinical Trials; mRNA Expression; mycobacterial; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; new therapeutic target; novel; novel marker; Occupational Exposure; pathogen; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pattern; Pneumonia; Public Health; Pulmonary Tuberculosis; Reporting; Research Priority; response; response biomarker; Risk; RNA; RNA Interference; service member; Services; Site; Small RNA; Specificity; Specimen; Surrogate Endpoint; targeted treatment; Testing; Time; TNF receptor-associated factor 3; Transcript; transcriptome sequencing; Treatment Failure; treatment response; Tuberculosis; tuberculosis drugs; tuberculosis immunity; tuberculosis treatment; Uganda; Untranslated RNA; Veterans; Whole Blood; ","Blood Expression Profiles as a Biomarker for Responses to Tuberculosis Treatment","000914","INFB","Infectious Diseases B ","","","04","","","",""

This project seeks to determine the role of resident monocytes, a type of inflammatory cells that can potentially regulate vascular remodeling and repair, in the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension, potentially allowing for the design of curative monocyte-directed therapy.","10100503; ","YU, YEN-REI ANDREA;","COLOMBINI-HATCH, SANDRA ","09/15/2015","03/31/2020","Ablation; arteriole; base; Basic Science; biobank; Biology; Blood Vessels; bone morphogenetic protein receptors; career development; Cell physiology; cell type; Cells; Cessation of life; Chronic; Data; Dendritic Cells; design; Development; Development Plans; Diagnosis; Disease; Disease Progression; Educational Curriculum; Endothelial Cells; Ensure; Etiology; experimental study; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Goals; Health; Heart failure; Hypoxia; Hypoxia Inducible Factor; hypoxia inducible factor 1; Immune; Immunobiology; Immunology; Immunotherapy; improved; in vivo; Infiltration; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Inflammatory Response; insight; interest; knockout gene; Knowledge; Label; laboratory experience; Lung; macrophage; Mentors; Mining; Modeling; monocyte; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Mus; Mutation; Myeloid Cells; novel; Oxygen; Pathogenesis; Patients; Physicians; Play; Population; pressure; prevent; pulmonary arterial hypertension; Pulmonary artery structure; Pulmonary vessels; Quality of life; Rattus; recombinase; Regulation; repaired; Reporter; Reporting; Research; Research Project Grants; response; Role; Scientist; sensor; Sensory; Severities; Signaling Molecule; skills; Smooth Muscle Myocytes; Stimulus; Stress; Technical Expertise; Techniques; Testing; therapeutic target; Time; Training; Transgenic Mice; translation to humans; Vascular remodeling; Vascular Smooth Muscle; Writing; ","Role of Resident Monocytes in the Pathogenesis of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension","121185","ZHL1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","03","124845","9988","134833",""

The testosterone therapy will be combined with finasteride which prevents prostate enlargement. The objective of my Sub-Study will be to determine if this novel intervention improves walking function. Secondly, I will evaluate whether these improvements are due to increased thigh muscle mass, knee extension strength, and/or better muscle recruitment from the knee extensors.

The funds will be used to support conference participation by young United States investigators, post-doctoral fellows and students, selected on the basis of outstanding abstracts. 'Young investigators? will be defined as scientists under 40 who have not acted as principal investigators on an RO1 grant or its financial equivalent. The BioIron conference has taken place every two years, rotating between countries on different continents, and hosted by local institutions with an active research program in iron biology. BioIron has served as the major forum for comprehensive presentation and discussion of advances in iron biology as relevant to iron-related diseases (heritable iron overload and deficiency disorders, secondary iron-loading erythropoietic disorders, inflammatory and infectious conditions), as well as novel biomarkers or therapeutic targets related to these diseases. The clinically translatable aspects of iron biology will be a major emphasis at the 2017 conference. NIH and NIDDK priorities have been specifically taken into account in its planning. In addition to a broad overview of the current state-of-the-art in iron pathobiology, the program will highlight novel advances relevant to diagnostics and therapeutics, as well as the pathogenesis of diseases in which iron plays an important (even if indirect) exacerbating role. To particularly address the needs of young investigators, we will have sessions to broaden the participants' knowledge base (clinical aspects for basic scientists and vice versa). We have organized 'Meet the Experts' sessions to foster and promote interactions between young and established investigators. We have included smaller more intimate satellite meetings on specialized topics to be held on the final day. We are confident BioIron 2017 will provide a forum of great value to those newly entering our field. We hope it will serve as a catalyst for success of particular value to individuals in groups historically disadvantaged in developing their investigative careers. IBIS is grateful for the support provided by the National Institutes of Health for previous BioIron meetings, and hopes to again facilitate the opportunity for young promising investigators to join in our vibrant exchanges.","1986122; ","FLEMING, ROBERT E;","GOSSETT, DANIEL ROBERT","04/01/2017","07/31/2017","abstracting; Address; Applications Grants; Area; Attention; Australia; Award; base; Basic Science; Biology; Biomedical Research; Canada; career; catalyst; Chemistry; Child Care; China; Clinical; Clinical Research; Clinical Sciences; clinically translatable; Collaborations; Communicable Diseases; Communities; Country; Critiques; Diagnostic; directed attention; Disadvantaged; Discipline; Disease; Ecology; Endocrinologist; Europe; Feedback; Fostering; Free Radicals; Functional disorder; Funding; Future; Gastroenterologist; Grant; Hearing; Hematologist; Individual; Inflammatory; Institution; interest; International; Iron; iron deficiency; Iron Overload; Japan; knowledge base; Los Angeles; Medical; medical specialist; meetings; Metabolism; Microbiology; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases; Neurologist; new therapeutic target; novel; novel marker; nutrition; Participant; Pathogenesis; Play; Postdoctoral Fellow; posters; Principal Investigator; Prize; programs; Research; Research Personnel; Role; Scientist; Senior Scientist; Societies; South America; structural biology; Students; success; symposium; System; Therapeutic; Training; United States; United States National Institutes of Health; Wheelchair fitting; Work; ","2017 BioIron Conference","113771","ZDK1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","19600","0","19600",""

This system will allow our researchers, including those studying musculoskeletal, ophthalmologic, and dermatologic diseases, access to unmatched resolution for structural and functional investigations to ultimately improve Veteran care. 1","10778011; ","CHANG, ERIC Y;","","01/01/2017","09/30/2017","Anatomy; Animals; Anterior; base; Blood flow; Caring; Cartilage; Cereals; Characteristics; Clinical; clinical application; clinical investigation; Communities; Dermatologic; Devices; Diabetes Mellitus; digital; Disease; experience; Eye; Frequencies; Functional disorder; Head; Head and neck structure; Human; Image; imaging modality; imaging system; implantable device; improved; in vivo; Injury; Investigation; Ionizing radiation; Location; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; medical specialties; Modality; Mus; Muscle; Musculoskeletal; musculoskeletal imaging/visualization/scanning; Musculoskeletal System; Nerve; non-invasive imaging; Obesity; Organ; Oryctolagus cuniculus; Pain; Patients; Pelvic Floor Muscle; Peripheral Nerves; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases; Population; pre-clinical; Quality of Care; Rattus; Research; Research Personnel; Research Project Grants; research study; Resolution; Rotator Cuff; Scanning; Silicon Dioxide; Skin; Speed; Sphincter; Spinal; Spinal Cord Diseases; Structure; Surface; System; Systemic disease; Tendon structure; Time; Tissues; Transducers; Trauma; ultra high resolution; Ultrasonography; United States Food and Drug Administration; Veterans; volunteer; Work; X-Ray Computed Tomography; ","ShEEP-IC: Request for Vevo MD Ultrasound System","004013","SPLJ","Special Initiatives - Shared Equipment (ShEEP/LAMb) ","","","01","","","",""

Clinical and preclinical experimental studies suggest that acute inflammation following ischemic stroke contributes to brain cell death. However, the immune cells and mechanisms involved in this inflammation are not fully understood, and consequently there is no available treatment that targets the acute immune response following ischemic stroke. Our lab has recently published that the immune cell-derived cytokine IL-21 contributes to brain damage in an animal model of stroke. We also detected IL-21?producing cells in perivascular regions and infarcted brain areas in human stroke tissues, but not in the healthy brain, which indicates that IL-21?producing cells from the blood infiltrate the CNS following ischemic stroke. Altogether, these data suggest that inhibiting IL-21 might be beneficial in stroke management. This proposal addresses novel mechanisms of IL-21 production and effects in ischemic stroke. The application of IL-21 antagonist as a novel treatment following stroke may directly impact patients with ischemic brain injuries.","1859631; ","FABRY, ZSUZSANNA ;","BOSETTI, FRANCESCA ","04/01/2017","03/31/2018","Acute; Acute Brain Injuries; acute stroke; Address; Adult; Alteplase; Animal Model; Antibodies; Area; Blood Cells; Brain; brain cell; Brain Hypoxia; Brain Injuries; brain tissue; Cause of Death; CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes; Cell Death; Cells; Cerebral Ischemia; Chronic; Clinical; Clinical Research; cytokine; Data; disability; experimental study; Flow Cytometry; Functional disorder; Goals; Helper-Inducer T-Lymphocyte; Human; Immune; Immune response; Immunohistochemistry; In Vitro; in vivo; Infarction; Inflammation; injured; Injury; interleukin-21; Ischemic Brain Injury; Ischemic Stroke; Lead; Lesion; Lymphocyte; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; Mouse Strains; Mus; Nerve Degeneration; Nervous system structure; neuroinflammation; neuron loss; Neuronal Dysfunction; Neurons; neurovascular unit; new therapeutic target; novel; Patients; Phase; pre-clinical; preclinical study; Process; Production; protective effect; Publishing; Purinoceptor; Recruitment Activity; regenerative; Regulatory Pathway; Reperfusion Injury; Reporter; Role; Signal Transduction; Source; spatiotemporal; stroke; stroke therapy; T-Lymphocyte; targeted treatment; Testing; Tissues; TNF gene; United States; Work; ","The role of T cells in ischemic brain damage","092400","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","01","218750","110373","329123",""

PROJECT NARRATIVE Hyperarousal and other abnormalities in cortical excitability have been well documented in animal and slice models of Fragile X syndrome (FXS). However, the degree that these abnormalities are present, including any clinical correlates, in humans with FXS in the sensorimotor cortex remains an open question in the literature. The proposed studies will use human electrophysiology including transcranial magnetic stimulation and high density EEG to measure sensorimotor and sensory circuits in humans with FXS. These studies will shed light on the proposed magnitude and mechanism of cortical abnormalities in FXS. The quantification and correlation of these deficits can aid in the development of physiological biomarkers, which may differentiate endotypes of disease or speed drug discovery.","12290974; ","PEDAPATI, ERNEST VIJAY;","SARAMPOTE, CHRISTOPHER S.","04/07/2017","03/31/2022","Address; Agonist; Animal Model; Animals; Anxiety; Auditory; Autistic Disorder; base; Biological Markers; Brain; case control; Clinical; clinical phenotype; Contralateral; Data; Defect; density; Development; Disease; drug discovery; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology (science); Epilepsy; Event-Related Potentials; Fragile X Syndrome; Functional disorder; gamma-Aminobutyric Acid; Glutamates; Goals; habituation; Human; Hypersensitivity; Impairment; Incidence; Individual; individualized medicine; Intellectual functioning disability; Light; Literature; Measurement; Measures; mental age; Modeling; Motor; Motor Activity; Motor Cortex; Motor Evoked Potentials; motor impairment; Muscle; neocortical; neural circuit; neural correlate; Neurodevelopmental Disorder; neurophysiology; neurotransmission; novel; phenomenological models; Phenotype; Physiologic pulse; Physiological; Physiology; Population; predicting response; programs; Research; Research Training; Rest; sensorimotor system; Sensory; sensory cortex; sensory stimulus; Severities; skills; Slice; somatosensory; Speed; System; Techniques; Testing; theories; Time; training project; Transcranial magnetic stimulation; Translational Research; treatment response; treatment strategy; Visual; ","Anomalous Sensorimotor Physiology in Fragile X Syndrome","112936","NPAS","Neural Basis of Psychopathology, Addictions and Sleep Disorders Study Section ","","","01","169531","13402","182933",""

Coordination of muscles in each leg and appropriate limb stiffness are critical for weight support and walking. Even though not directly damaged, the basic system responsible, lying partially in the muscle, becomes dysfunctional post-SCI. This study will increase understanding of, and test a new rehabilitation strategy designed to reverse, these changes and improve weight support and walking. The long term goal is enhanced recovery for those with SCIs.

The work outlined in this proposal will help bridge the disconnect between microbial community interactions and gene function, and build a framework for understanding how microbes function in complex communities.","12547732; ","HENTCHEL, KRISTY LYNN;","MAAS, STEFAN ","04/01/2017","03/31/2019","abstracting; Address; Affinity; Alleles; Alphaproteobacteria; Architecture; Area; Bacteria; Bacterial Genome; Binding; Biochemical; Biological; biological adaptation to stress; Biological Models; career; Caulobacter crescentus; cell growth; Cells; Cellular Stress; Chemicals; Clinical; Communities; Complex; Cues; Data; Discipline; DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase; Ecology; Ecosystem; Ensure; Environment; environmental change; experimental study; Feedback; fitness; Fresh Water; frontier; gain of function; Gene Expression; gene function; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Transcription; Goals; Growth; Human; innovation; insight; interdisciplinary approach; Laboratories; Left; Measures; metagenome; Methods; Michigan; Microbe; microbial; microbial community; Microbial Physiology; Microbiology; microbiome; Molecular; Molecular Biology; Molecular Genetics; mutant; novel; novel strategies; Output; Phosphorylation; Phosphotransferases; physical conditioning; Physiology; Positioning Attribute; post-doctoral training; Process; Protein Analysis; protein-histidine kinase; Proteins; Regulon; Research; Research Training; response; Scientist; sensor; sensor histidine kinase; Sensory; sensory integration; Sigma Factor; Signal Transduction; stem; Sterility; Stress; Stress Response Signaling; Structure; System; Techniques; Transduction Gene; Water; Work; ","Understanding Activation of the General Stress Response in a Natural Environment","122242","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","01","56694","","56694",""

If medicine is to move beyond conventional drug targets that represent symptomatic treatment only, then validation of these epigenetic enzymes and factors as drug targets remains a top priority for drug discovery. Chemical epigenetic inhibitors represent a powerful opportunity here. However, histone methylation is a relatively new discovery space, and the likely structures of HMT inhibitors are not well defined. Few small molecule inhibitors are available, either for laboratory research or fo lead development. Therefore, there is a significant and urgent need to develop assays and to identify new chemical probes for these targets. Small molecule probes would serve a valuable role in scientific investigations and serve as medicinal chemistry scaffolds for lead development and drug discovery. With the completion of this application we will be able to provide high quality probes that can be used 1) to validate epigenetic targets' biological activities, 2) as a standard reference to customers' drug development activities, and 3) as leads for potential therapeutic agents. In addition, we will be able to launch one of the largest publicly available chemical-epigenetic data bases built on the screening activities from the compound collections that include most of the FDA approved drugs, clinical trial agents, diversified libraries, and natural products.","1873794; ","MA, HAICHING ;","PORTILLA, LILLIANNE M","06/20/2014","03/31/2018","Acetylation; analog; Animal Cancer Model; Area; base; Binding; Binding Proteins; Biochemical; Biological; Biological Assay; Biological Process; Biology; Blood; Bromodomain; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cardiovascular system; Cells; Chemicals; Clinical Pharmacology; Clinical Trials; Collaborations; Collection; commercialization; Data; Databases; Development; Disease; DNA Sequence Alteration; drug development; drug discovery; Drug Targeting; Effectiveness; Enzymes; Epigenetic Process; epigenomics; FDA approved; Funding; Genomics; Goals; Health; histone methylation; histone methyltransferase; Histones; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; Individual; inhibitor/antagonist; Investigation; Kinetics; Laboratory Research; Lead; Libraries; Malignant Neoplasms; Marketing; Medicine; meetings; Metabolic Diseases; Methods; Methylation; nanomolar; Natural Products; Neurodegenerative Disorders; new technology; new therapeutic target; Peptide Hydrolases; Pharmaceutical Chemistry; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase; phase 1 study; Phosphotransferases; Preclinical Drug Evaluation; Property; Protein Family; Proteins; Publishing; Radioisotopes; Reaction; Reference Standards; Research; Role; scaffold; screening; Small Business Innovation Research Grant; small molecule; small molecule inhibitor; Staging; Structure; Structure-Activity Relationship; symptom treatment; Testing; Therapeutic Agents; therapeutic effectiveness; tool; Toxic effect; Universities; Validation; Work; ","Epigenetic Probes for HMTs","000940","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","03","","","764740",""

With no prevention or treatment, individuals with AD could reach 11-16 million by 2050; healthcare costs for AD alone were estimated at $200 billion in 2012. With this growing Veteran population is an increase in chronic health conditions, and social and financial burdens. Interventions that enhance endogenous pro-growth signaling may evoke neuroplasticity in the AD brain and improve motor and cognitive function in the Veteran population. The proposed research will attempt to use a novel approach to enhance neuronal growth by overexpressing caveolin levels in neurons in combination with already existing pharmacological interventions.

However, none of the current online data collection systems offer developmentally appropriate tools specifically designed to address literacy, motivation, and attention issues that can lower quality of data collected with children younger than 12 years. An integral component of clinical, social, and behavioral sciences is the collection of survey data. When that research involves children, it is often beneficial, if not essential, to collect data directly from the child. Howeve, the quality of the data collected will drive the degree to which scientific discoveries can be translated into improvements in public healthcare. This Phase II SBIR will yield Quest, a highly innovative, child-friendly online data collection system that can be broadly applied in the service of clinical, behavioral, and social research and supporting NCATS's Strategic Priorities to build research capacity by addressing the developmental challenges of data collection with children, which in turn, would support efforts to translate research findings into clinical practice so that health outcomes for children can be enhanced.","11577878; 8194555 (contact); ","CRAIG, ASHLEY ; DEROSIER, MELISSA E.

We recently discovered that suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS1), which is a negative regulator of the master inflammatory nuclear factor NF?B, is inhibited by NO produced in the nucleus of macrophages by neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS1). This discovery suggests that there is a previously unreported mechanism that determines macrophage function, that impacts inflammation propagation and resolution and that can be potentially targeted to promote pathogen clearance or suppress tissue injury caused by exacerbated inflammation. This application will (1) Determine how the NOS1/SOCS1 axis switches NF?B activity from pro- to anti-inflammatory; (2) How hypoxia and reactive oxygen species, which occur in inflamed tissues, impact this switch; (3) How the NOS1/SOCS1 axis coordinate the mounting of an effective pathogen killing response in the lung that evolves to inflammation resolution and tissue healing. We expect that information generated by these studies will help to develop strategies to inhibit inflammatory lung injury or accelerate inflammatory resolution.","9830818; ","BONINI, MARCELO G;","JIANG, CHAO ","04/07/2017","03/31/2022","Acute; Acute Lung Injury; Address; Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome; Affect; Alveolar; Anti-inflammatory; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Bacterial Pneumonia; base; Biochemical Process; Cell Nucleus; cell type; CISH gene; Complex; Critical Illness; Cysteine; Development; Diffuse; Enzymes; Gene Expression; Genes; Genetic Transcription; Genetically Engineered Mouse; Healed; healing; Hypoxia; Immune; Immune response; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Injury; intravital microscopy; Killings; Lead; Life; Lung; Lung Inflammation; lung injury; macrophage; Mediating; Modeling; Modification; Molecular; mortality; mouse model; Mus; Myeloid Cells; Natural Immunity; neutrophil; Nitric Oxide; Nitric Oxide Synthase Type I; novel; novel therapeutic intervention; Nuclear; Outcome; Output; oxidation; Oxidation-Reduction; p65; pathogen; Phenotype; Play; Population; Prevalence; prevent; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Publishing; Pulmonary Inflammation; Reactive Oxygen Species; Resolution; Respiratory Failure; response; Role; Signal Transduction; Sterility; Structure of parenchyma of lung; surfactant production; SWI1; Testing; Tissues; TNFRSF5 gene; transcription factor; Transcription Factor 3; two-photon; ","Macrophage Redox State in Sterilizing and Injurious Inflammation","131267","LIRR","Lung Injury, Repair, and Remodeling Study Section ","","A1","01","275949","165293","441242",""

Approximately 80% of alcohol-dependent individuals are also regular tobacco smokers. This suggests that common underlying mechanisms may regulate the motivational properties of alcohol and nicotine, the major addictive component of tobacco smoke. Human genome-wide association studies have revealed that allelic variation in CHRNA5, the gene encoding the ?5 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit located in chromosome region 15q25, increases the risk of developing tobacco and alcohol dependence. Expression of ?5 nAChR subunits is enriched in the medial habenula (MHb)-interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) pathway. Recently, our laboratory established that nAChRs containing ?5 in the MHb-IPN system regulate nicotine intake. Here, we will test the hypothesis that nAChRs containing ?5-containing nAChRs in the MHb-IPN pathway regulate the motivational properties of alcohol. This program of research promises to identify new targets for the development of therapeutic agents for alcohol and tobacco dependence and may therefore have a significant positive impact on human health.","8033639; ","KENNY, PAUL J;","CUI, CHANGHAI ","07/15/2016","03/31/2021","15q25; addiction; Agonist; Alcohol consumption; Alcohol dependence; alcohol effect; alcohol reinforcement; Alcohol withdrawal syndrome; Alcoholism; Alcohols; Attenuated; Back; Behavioral; Biological Assay; Cell Nucleus; Cells; Cessation of life; Chantix; Chromosomes; Consumption; Control Animal; Coupled; designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs; Development; Disease; dopamine system; Electrophysiology (science); Gene Transfer; Genes; genome wide association study; Goals; Habenula; Habits; Health; Human; Human Genome; Individual; innovation; insight; Intake; interdisciplinary approach; interpeduncular nucleus; knock-down; Knock-in Mouse; Knockout Mice; Laboratories; Marketing; Medial; Mediating; Midbrain structure; Molecular Genetics; Mus; Mutant Strains Mice; Neurons; Nicotine; Nicotinic Receptors; Non-smoker; novel; optogenetics; Pathway interactions; Play; premature; Prevalence; Procedures; programs; promoter; Property; Rattus; receptor; receptor function; Receptor Signaling; recombinase; Research; response; Rewards; Risk; risk variant; Rodent; Role; Rubidium; Self Stimulation; Signal Transduction; Slice; Smoker; smoking cessation; Synapses; System; Techniques; Technology; Testing; Therapeutic Agents; Time; Tobacco; Tobacco Dependence; Tobacco smoke; Tobacco smoking; transmission process; United States; varenicline; Variant; vector; Virus; Whole-Cell Recordings; ","Nicotinic receptors and alcohol reinforcement","024292","NAL","Neurotoxicology and Alcohol Study Section ","","","02","202500","140737","343237",""
