HIV prevention remains critical to turn the tide of HIV infections and an effective vaccine against HIV-1 is desperately needed. The ability of HIV-1 to escape immune responses represents a sophisticated hurdle that has to be resolved to develop a protective vaccine regimen. Similarly, continuous effort is required to develop vaccines that will impact HIV-1 co-morbidities represented by TB and malaria These initiatives will be based on the effort provided by young African scientists. The proposed IDA symposia will fill a gap in the ongoing effort of building scientific literacy on the continent and enhancing the acumen of performing immunology research by providing focused scientific training to the young African scientists. We believe that the proposed symposia will lead to increased scientific knowledge and will help build future scientific leaders on the Continent that will support the NIH effort (among many agencies) to perform clinical vaccine trials in Africa. In this grant, we now propose a further set of symposia, where the overarching aims of the IDA symposia are: 1) to continue to provide cutting-edge knowledge in the fields of HIV vaccine development and related aspects of malaria and TB; and 2) to foster scientific leadership on the African Continent. ! !","6779612; ","FERRARI, GUIDO ;","GUTIERREZ, MARTIN ","07/15/2009","01/31/2020","abstracting; Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Affect; Africa; Africa South of the Sahara; African; Age; age group; AIDS prevention; AIDS/HIV problem; Animal Model; Anti-Retroviral Agents; Area; Back; base; Basic Science; Cause of Death; Cellular Immunity; Cessation of life; Child; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials; co-infection; Collaborations; Communicable Diseases; Comorbidity; Complex; cost; Country; Data; design; Development; Disease; Economics; Educational Curriculum; Educational process of instructing; Epidemic; European Economic Community; Event; experience; Face; Faculty; Fostering; Foundations; Funding; Future; Future Teacher; Grant; Guidelines; HIV; HIV Infections; HIV vaccine; HIV-1; HIV-1 vaccine; HIV/TB; Iatrogenesis; Immune; Immune response; Immune system; Immunity; Immunology; Incidence; Incubators; Infection; Infusion procedures; International Agencies; Investigation; Knowledge; knowledge base; Lead; Leadership; Learning; Life; Malaria; meetings; Mentorship; Monitoring Clinical Trials; neutralizing antibody; novel vaccines; Outcome; Passive Immunization; pathogen; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase I Clinical Trials; Play; Population; pre-clinical; Prevalence; Prevention strategy; Progress Reports; Regimen; Reporting; Research; Research Personnel; Research Priority; Research Project Grants; Research Training; Role; Running; Science; scientific literacy; Scientist; Series; South Africa; success; symposium; teacher mentor; Thinking; Time; tool; Training; Tuberculosis; United States National Institutes of Health; Vaccine Clinical Trial; Vaccine Design; vaccine development; Vaccine Research; vaccine trial; Vaccines; World Health Organization; ","Infectious Diseases in Africa: Immune Escape and HIV Vaccines","084562","ZAI1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","07","25000","0","25000",""

Although it is possible to induce allergic responses to any dietary protein, the majority of allergic food reactions are a result of the following eight sources: cow?s milk, eggs, wheat, soy, shellfish, fish, tree nuts and peanuts. Peanuts and tree nuts account for 80% of severe allergic food reactions and it is projected that over 3 million Americans have an allergy to peanuts and will maintain this allergy throughout their lifetime. It is estimated that 1-2% of children in the Westernized world are allergic to peanuts. Unlike milk or egg allergies, peanut hypersensitivity is rarely outgrown and the majority of fatal and near-fatal reactions to foods are caused by peanuts and tree nuts. In addition, peanut allergens have been shown to cross-react with other nut allergens and present additional hypersensitivities. Trace amounts of peanut can be found in many dietary products and can trigger severe reactions.

But there are few experimental systems in which to study the details of the natural competitive interactions between invading pathogens and resident microbiota that can determine the outcome of exposure to infectious disease. We have recently shown that Bordetella pertussis, which causes whooping cough in humans, poorly colonizes the respiratory tracts of mice because of competition with resident microbiota, while the closely related B. bronchiseptica is able to efficiently colonize mice, displacing the resident microbiota in the process. This proposal seeks to understand the ecological mechanisms behind how resident microorganisms can inhibit B. pertussis colonization and the molecular mechanisms by which B. bronchiseptica eliminates chronic colonizers of the respiratory tract.","1942525; ","HARVILL, ERIC T.;","REDDY, MICHAEL K.","02/01/2015","01/31/2019","Address; Affect; Animals; Antibiotics; Area; Bacteria; Books; Bordetella; Bordetella pertussis Bacterium; Candidate Disease Gene; Chronic; Communicable Diseases; Comparative Biology; comparative genomics; Complex; Data; Ecosystem; experience; Exposure to; Failure; forward genetics; Future; Genes; Genetic; genetic approach; Genome; Genomics; Goals; Health; Host Defense; Human; Human Microbiome; Immune; In Vitro; in vivo; Individual; Infection; Infectious Disease Immunology; innovation; interdisciplinary approach; Invaded; Knowledge; Libraries; Location; Lung diseases; Mediating; Microbe; microbiome; microbiota; microorganism; Molecular; Mus; Mutation; Nasal cavity; Nature; Nose; novel strategies; Organism; Outcome; pathogen; Pattern; Pertussis; Predisposition; prevent; Prevention strategy; Process; research study; Resistance; respiratory; Respiratory System; Respiratory tract structure; reverse genetics; Role; System; Text; Therapeutic; Tissues; tool; Translating; Virulence Factors; weapons; Work; ","The Microbiota Pathogen Competition","113681","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","S1","03","43122","21561","64683",""

More than 1.3 million people die annually and the 5-year survival rates have improved only marginally in the last three decades. While population-based screening programs based on low-dose computed tomography (CT) are likely to reduce the number of deaths due to lung cancer, a significant challenge that remains is how to safely and accurately diagnose small spots (nodules) found on a screening CT. Our project is to develop small biopsy probes with integrated real-time image guidance. The biopsy probes will be inserted into the biopsy channel of a standard bronchoscope and navigated to the lung spot using virtual bronchoscopy similar to a GPS guidance system. The probe will use optical coherence tomography (OCT) to confirm the exact location of the spot to be sampled. The principle of OCT is similar to ultrasound. Instead of sound waves, near-infrared light is used to produce a high definition image similar to looking down a microscope. Our OCT probe will be much smaller than an ultrasound probe. It can detect blood vessels using the Doppler effect and analyze the chemical contents of the nodule using tissue autofluorescence imaging. The procedure will be done under local anesthesia to the throat and conscious sedation. These innovative imaging-biopsy probes will be the first of its kind to allow the accurate biopsy of small lung nodules while minimizing complications such as bleeding and lung collapse. It will advance the bronchoscopic diagnosis of small lung lesions.","11021462; ","VERTIKOV, ANDREI ;","EVANS, GREGORY ","02/05/2017","04/30/2017","3-Dimensional; Address; Animal Model; animation; base; Behavior; Biological; Biopsy; Blood Vessels; British Columbia; Bronchi; Bronchoscopes; Bronchoscopy; Caliber; Cancer Etiology; Catheters; Cessation of life; Chemicals; Clinical; Collection; Color; Conscious Sedation; Custom; Data Set; Detection; Devices; Diagnosis; Diagnostic; diagnostic accuracy; Doppler Effect; Dose; Electromagnetics; Family suidae; Fluorescence Bronchoscopy; follow-up; Forcep; Future; Goals; Health; Hemorrhage; high risk; Human; Image; image guided; Image Guided Biopsy; imaging modality; imaging probe; improved; in vivo; innovation; instrument; Knowledge; Lesion; Light; Local anesthesia; Location; Lung; Lung nodule; Malignant - descriptor; Malignant neoplasm of lung; Malignant Neoplasms; Medical; Medical Device; medical specialties; Microscope; Miniaturization; miniaturize; Modality; Modeling; molecular pathology; Needle biopsy procedure; Needles; Nodule; Optical Coherence Tomography; Patients; Performance; Peripheral; Pharyngeal structure; Phase; Pneumothorax; population based; Positioning Attribute; Preparation; pressure; primary outcome; Procedures; programs; Property; Radial; Research; Resolution; Risk; Safety; sample collection; Sampling; screening; Screening for Lung Cancer; Side; Site; Small Business Innovation Research Grant; sound; Specificity; Spiral Computed Tomography; Spottings; Structure of parenchyma of lung; Survival Rate; System; Techniques; Testing; Three-Dimensional Image; Time; Tissue Sample; Tissues; tool; Translating; Ultrasonography; virtual; Work; X-Ray Computed Tomography; ","Biopsy Probes with Real-time Multi-modality Image Guidance for Peripheral Lung Nodules","203033","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","S1","01","","","50000",""

Fortunately, many patients with advanced disease who no longer respond adequately to medications can be treated successfully with an FDA- approved implantable device that provides electrical stimulation deep within the brain, a therapy known as deep brain stimulation (DBS). DBS is being used for the treatment of a variety of movement as well as psychiatric disorders, with new applications arising at a rapid pace despite all that remains unknown about how it works. While DBS therapy generally is effective for patients with PD, results still vary widely among individual patients. In this study, we will use non-human primates with Parkinson-like motor symptoms to  investigate further the therapeutic effect of DBS delivered to two specific areas of the brain (the 'STN' and  'GPi') that are known to improve symptoms in both affected non-human primates and patients. Stimulation at these sites causes changes in neuron activity, not only at the site of stimulation, but also in and between other regions of the brain involved in planning and executing movement. We will examine and characterize changes in physiological interactions that occur between structures within the 'motor circuit' of the brain before and during the development of parkinsonian motor symptoms in animal subjects and subsequently in the absence and presence of DBS therapy. Results from this study will provide significant insights into how communication between key structures within the motor circuit network is altered in the parkinsonian state and how DBS modifies these interactions to produce a therapeutic effect. We will use our findings to develop and assess a DBS strategy that may provide a more continuous and beneficial therapeutic effect than current approaches.","1869779; ","VITEK, JERROLD L;","SIEBER, BETH-ANNE ","07/01/1999","01/31/2019","advanced disease; Affect; Animals; Area; Basal Ganglia; Biological Markers; biomarker selection; Brain; Brain region; Communication; Coupling; Data; Deep Brain Stimulation; Development; Diagnosis; Disease; Dyskinetic syndrome; Electric Stimulation; FDA approved; Frequencies; Functional disorder; Globus Pallidus; Goals; Health; implantable device; improved; individual patient; insight; kinematics; Mental disorders; Modeling; Motor; Motor Cortex; motor function improvement; motor symptom; Movement; Neurons; Nodal; nonhuman primate; Parkinson Disease; Parkinsonian Disorders; Patients; Pattern; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase; Physiological; Population; relating to nervous system; Rest; Role; Signal Transduction; Site; Source; Structure; Structure of subthalamic nucleus; success; symptomatic improvement; System; Techniques; Testing; Thalamic structure; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Effect; Time; Work; ","Basal Ganglia Cortical Coupling and Connectivity Changes in PD and DBS","037019","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","17","341769","177719","519488",""

We observed neurological disease phenotypes in mice expressing dominant-negative PPAR?, thereby identifying neurons as a cell type where PPAR? function is essential for homeostasis, validated a selective and potent PPAR? agonist, KD3010, as capable of rescuing htt neurotoxicity, and documented significant improvements in motor function, neurodegeneration, and survival in HD mice treated with KD3010 agonist. In this renewal proposal, we will determine how PPAR? promotes neuroprotection by examining the effects of PPAR? on bioenergetics function, autophagy, and mitochondrial quality control, by defining the cistrome and active regulome of PPAR? in normal neurons and HD neurons, by performing transcriptome analysis of HD mice treated with PPAR? agonist, and by validating identified PPAR? target genes and pathways in directed experiments in HD primary neurons cultured from BAC transgenic mice or derived from HD patient stem cells.","1926731; ","LA SPADA, ALBERT R;","MILLER, DANIEL L","02/01/2010","01/31/2021","3-nitropropionic acid; Agonist; Autophagocytosis; base; Behavioral; Bexarotene; Bioenergetics; Biological Models; CAG repeat; Cell Nucleus; cell type; ChIP-seq; Code; Corpus striatum structure; Data; Defect; Disease; disease phenotype; Dominant-Negative Mutation; Energy Metabolism; Funding; Gene Targeting; Genes; Genetic Transcription; global run on sequencing; Goals; Health; Homeostasis; Huntington Disease; Huntington gene; Impaired cognition; improved; induced pluripotent stem cell; insight; Involuntary Movements; Mental disorders; Metabolic; Mitochondria; mitochondrial autophagy; mitochondrial dysfunction; Modeling; Molecular; Motor; motor function improvement; Mus; mutant; Nerve Degeneration; nervous system disorder; Neurodegenerative Disorders; neurodegenerative phenotype; Neurons; neuropathology; Neurophysiology - biologic function; neuroprotection; neurotoxicity; Nuclear Receptors; Organelles; overexpression; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Patients; Peptide Fragments; Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors; Phenotype; polyglutamine; PPAR delta; PPAR gamma; preclinical trial; prevent; Production; Proteins; Quality Control; receptor function; Regulation; relating to nervous system; research study; Rodent; Role; RXR; stem; Stem cells; Testing; Toxin; Transactivation; transcriptome; transcriptome sequencing; Transgenic Mice; Trinucleotide Repeat Expansion; ","The PPAR-delta pathway in neural function and Huntington's disease neuropathology","065874","CMND","Cellular and Molecular Biology of Neurodegeneration Study Section ","","","07","280099","131535","411634",""

People with HD gradually lose their normal motor function, cognitive abilities, and emotional health. The course of the disease typically lasts from 15-20 years. There is currently no effective treatment or cure for HD. An early event in HD is the breakdown of energy metabolism resulting from defective mitochondria. We identified hyperactivity of dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) as one of the main culprits in this mitochondrial dysfunction. Therefore, the goal of this project is to unravel the detailed mechanisms by which DRP1 becomes overactive in HD. Insights gained here might lead to new therapies that can slow neuronal loss in HD, thereby improving patient's lives and lowering care-giving costs.","6136957; ","BOSSY-WETZEL, ELLA R;","MILLER, DANIEL L","04/01/2006","01/31/2018","Address; Affect; American; Apoptosis; ATP Synthesis Pathway; Axonal Transport; base; Binding; Binding Sites; Bioenergetics; Buffers; caregiving; Cell Death; cell injury; Cell Survival; Cells; Cellular biology; Chorea; cognitive ability; Complex; Corpus striatum structure; cost; cytochrome c; Data; Defect; Dementia; Development; Disease; Dynamin; effective therapy; Emotional; Energy Metabolism; Event; Exhibits; experience; Family; Functional disorder; Funding; Glutamine; Goals; Guanosine Triphosphate; Guanosine Triphosphate Phosphohydrolases; Health; Homeostasis; Human; Huntington Disease; Huntington gene; Hydrolysis; Hyperactive behavior; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; Inherited; Injury; insight; knock-down; Knockout Mice; Lead; Mediating; meetings; Mitochondria; mitochondrial dysfunction; Mitosis; Molecular Conformation; Morphology; Motor; Mus; mutant; Mutation; Nerve Degeneration; Neurodegenerative Disorders; neuron loss; Neuronal Injury; Neurons; neurotoxicity; novel therapeutics; particle; Patients; Phosphorylation; Phosphotransferases; Physiological; Play; polyglutamine; Post-Translational Protein Processing; Process; progressive chorea; Proteins; research study; respiratory; Role; self assembly; Site; Structure; Substrate Specificity; Synapses; synaptic function; Synaptic Transmission; System; targeted treatment; Testing; Therapeutic; three dimensional structure; ","Mitochondrial fission in Huntington's Disease","055193","NOMD","Neural Oxidative Metabolism and Death Study Section ","","","09","196875","85292","282167",""

Previous investigations into the role of EBV genes in the establishment and maintenance of infection and in oncogenesis have focused primarily on protein coding genes. Recent studies, however, have revealed that EBV encodes dozens of viral long non-coding RNAs (vlncRNAs). Here we begin investigations into this newly appreciated group of viral transcripts through studying a set of structurally diverse vlncRNAs expressed from the latency LMP2 locus during reactivation and new infection. Preliminary studies suggest that they play roles in virus reactivation through multiple mechanisms.","1895517; ","FLEMINGTON, ERIK K;","","","","Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Address; AIDS-Related Lymphoma; AIDS/HIV problem; Animal Model; Anti-Retroviral Agents; B-Cell Activation; B-Lymphocytes; base; BCR Signaling Pathway; Biological Process; Biology; Cancer Etiology; Cells; Chromatin; chromatin remodeling; Clinical; clinical sequencing; Code; Collaborations; Complement; Complex; Cytoplasm; Data; Disease; DNA Sequencing Facility; EBV-associated malignancy; Enhancers; epidemiologic data; Epstein-Barr Virus Infections; Exons; Frequencies; gammaherpesvirus; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Silencing; Genes; Growth; HIV; Human; Human Herpesvirus 4; Human Herpesvirus 8; imprint; Individual; Infection; Investigation; Laboratories; Lymphoma; Lytic; lytic gene expression; Maintenance; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; Membrane Proteins; MicroRNAs; Modeling; mouse model; novel; Nuclear; Oncogenic; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Patients; Play; Porifera; Process; programs; Property; Protein Isoforms; Proteins; reactivation from latency; Receptor Signaling; Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell; Regulation; research study; Resolution; Resources; RNA; RNA Splicing; Role; Series; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Specimen; Staging; Structure; Testing; therapeutic development; Transcript; Transcriptional Activation; transcriptomics; tumor; tumorigenesis; Untranslated RNA; Viral; Viral Genes; Viral Pathogenesis; Virion; Virus; Work; ","'Project 2' Epstein-Barr virus LMP2 IncRNAs","214091","ZCA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","6350","","01","151617","69931","","221548"

Current technologies (ultrasound, CT, MRI, PET, CA125 and physical exam) provide insufficient data to determine whether an ovary must be removed or is likely cancerous; therefore, a better method is needed to determine if ovarian tissue is malignant or benign. The successful completion of the project will provide a means to improve the current clinical practice; it will provide necessary technology to improve early ovarian cancer detection; and it will be an effective means to avoid surgery in most patients with a normal ovary.

Although truly extraordinary advances have been made in the treatment of other autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and ANCA- associated vasculitis, the treatment for lupus remains chemotherapy-based, for the most part effective, but also very toxic.

However, the properties of auditory electrical synapses remain poorly understood. As their chemical counterparts, electrical synapses are ?plastic?, that is, they modify their strength with activity. Changes in the strength of electrical synapses dynamically reconfigure neuronal circuits in various neural structures. Thus, the presence and plastic properties of electrical synapses could fundamentally change the way we understand the organization of auditory circuits and, ultimately, the processing of auditory information. This proposal aims to contribute to our understanding of electrical transmission in the auditory system by investigating the molecular mechanisms causing plastic changes in gap junction communication at mixed, electrical and chemical, contacts that couple primary auditory afferents to the Mauthner cells in fish, which are considered a valuable model for investigating plasticity of vertebrate electrical transmission. Our progress in goldfish shows that electrical (and chemical) transmission at these mixed synapses undergoes activity-dependent potentiation. We propose to investigate the contribution of trafficking of gap junction channels as a possible mechanism for regulating the strength of electrical transmission. To directly examine this possibility, we will take these unique model mixed synapses to a new level of analysis by investigating their properties in larval zebrafish. The amenability of zebrafish larvae for experimentation will provide an unprecedented window for the analysis of electrical transmission at which detailed molecular mechanisms will be investigated by combining in-vivo imaging, electrophysiology and time-resolved ultrastructural analysis with powerful genetic manipulations. The proposed research will expose novel mechanisms of regulation of auditory electrical synapses that will contribute to a deeper understanding of circuits relevant to auditory dysfunction and the potential identification of novel therapeutic targets.","1972924; ","PEREDA, ALBERTO E;","CYR, JANET ","07/01/2010","01/31/2022","abstracting; Adult; Auditory; auditory pathway; Auditory system; base; Behavior; Cells; Chemical Synapse; Chemicals; Chemosensitization; Communication; Complement; Complex; Connexins; Data; DNA Sequence Alteration; Dopamine; Electrical Synapse; Electron Microscopy; Electrophysiology (science); Excision; Fishes; Freezing; Functional disorder; gap junction channel; Gap Junctions; genetic manipulation; genetic regulatory protein; Goldfish; Image; in vivo; in vivo imaging; Larva; Life; M cell; Mediating; membrane flux; Methods; Microscopy; Modeling; Modification; Molecular; Monitor; Movement; neural circuit; Neuromodulator; neuronal circuitry; Neurotransmitter Receptor; new therapeutic target; novel; Optics; optogenetics; Pharmacology; Process; Property; Proteins; Protocols documentation; Regulation; relating to nervous system; Reporting; Research; Scaffolding Protein; Structure; Structure of dorsal cochlear nucleus; Synapses; Synaptic Transmission; Testing; Time; trafficking; Transgenic Organisms; transmission process; Work; Zebrafish; ","Plasticity of auditory electrical synapses","011099","AUD","Auditory System Study Section ","","A1","07","394618","208337","602955",""

Further, breast cancer incidence is projected to increase by ~45% over the next two decades. Although tamoxifen is considered the standard chemopreventive strategy for women at high-risk of breast cancer, it is medically contradicted in up to ~30% of high-risk women, associated with several adverse toxicities, and only effective for prevention of estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer. Thus, there is an urgent need for new, non-toxic strategies to prevent both ER+ and ER negative (ER-) breast cancer. The objective of this grant is to elucidate the 'dose-response' effect of exercise on inhibition of breast cancer initiation and the role of growth facto withdrawal to regulate this effect in preclinical and clinical studies. Our central hypothesis is tat exercise, in a dose-dependent manner, will reduce proinflammatory growth factor availability in the host (peripheral circulation) and mammary tissue that, in turn, will effectively inhibit 'core'cell signaling pathways that induce the transition to the malignant phenotype. If successful, the findings of this study could benefit thousands of women at high-risk of breast cancer and have significant public health impact.","8070359; ","JONES, LEE W;","HECKMAN-STODDARD, BRANDY ","09/23/2013","01/31/2020","Address; Adipocytes; Adverse effects; Aerobic; American; Animals; Antibodies; Apoptosis; Atypia; Atypical hyperplasia; Back; Biological; Biology; Blood Circulation; Breast; Breast Cancer Prevention; cancer initiation; cancer risk; Cell Adhesion; Cell Line; Cells; Cessation of life; Chemopreventive Agent; Clinical; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials; Contralateral; cytokine; Data; density; Diagnosis; Disease; Dose; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Epithelial; Epithelial Cell Proliferation; Epithelial Cells; Estrogen receptor negative; Estrogen receptor positive; Exercise; exercise capacity; exercise intensity; exercise training; Fine needle aspiration biopsy; follow-up; Formalin; Genetic; Grant; Growth; Growth Factor; Growth Factor Inhibition; Growth Factor Receptors; Health; Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method; High Risk Woman; Histology; Human; In Vitro; Incidence; Inhibition of Apoptosis; Knock-in; Laboratories; Lesion; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Malignant - descriptor; malignant breast neoplasm; Malignant Neoplasms; malignant phenotype; Mammary gland; Mammary Gland Parenchyma; Mammary Neoplasms; Mesenchymal; migration; Modeling; Molecular; Molecular Target; Mus; Natural History; Observational Study; Patients; Peripheral; Phase; Phenotype; Plasma; Postmenopause; pre-clinical; preclinical study; Premalignant; Premalignant Cell; prevent; Prevention; Protein Microchips; Public Health; Randomized; randomized trial; Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases; Recombinant Growth Factor; research study; response; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Role; Running; Sampling; sedentary; Serum; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Tamoxifen; Testing; Tissue Sample; Tissues; Toxic effect; Training; Transgenic Model; treadmill; tumor; Validation; Walking; Withdrawal; Woman; Work; ","(PQA5) 'Dose and Mechanisms of Exercise in Breast Cancer Prevention'","179992","ZCA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","04","465186","353076","818262",""

Many cancers spread to other organs and breast cancers often spread to the skeletal system, comprised of 206 bones, the largest organ and reservoir for metastatic cancers in the human body. The skeletal environment enables breast cancers to proliferate and destroy bones, cause fractures, and shorten life expectancy. Therefore, killing breast cancers in bone and preventing pathological fractures are important strategies for treating advanced breast cancers. Inflammation is a process of disease that promotes cancer growth and bone destruction. Therefore, shutting down inflammation may be an effective way of controlling advanced breast cancers in bone. We have found a promising way of reducing breast cancer burden and preventing bone destruction by adding anti-inflammatory drugs in addition to current standard of care anti-cancer drug therapies.

Not only is human sensory system dysfunction associated with disease, temperature sensing is important for the survival and host-seeking behavior of insect vectors of human disease 1. Mosquito-borne diseases alone are estimated to affect hundreds of millions of people and to be responsible for several million deaths annually 2. At present, the molecular identity of insect cold receptors is unknown. Knowledge of temperature sensing may be applied to control disease-carrying insects. The basic mechanisms of insect thermo-sensation could be used to identify a way for disrupting the life cycle or host-seeking behavior of disease-carrying insects. Studying thermal detection in the experimentally favorable Drosophila system is thus important for both basic science and human health. This work will study the role of members of the ionotropic Glutamate Receptor (iGluR) family. Within the iGluR family, NMDA and AMPA/Kainate receptors regulate neurotransmission from insects to humans. These receptors are targets for anesthetics/antidepressants (e.g., ketamine, an NMDA antagonist7) and anti- convulsants (e.g., perampanel, an AMPA antagonist8), and insect IRs are important in chemoreception6. Demonstrating a role for IRs in thermal detection would identify a new function for iGluR family receptors and give new insight into how such receptors can be regulated.","9260837; ","BUDELLI, GONZALO ;","HOODBHOY, TANYA ","01/16/2015","01/15/2017","Acids; Affect; Amines; Anesthetics; Animals; Antidepressive Agents; Basic Science; Behavior; Body Temperature; Calcium; Cells; Cessation of life; Chemoreceptors; Convulsants; Culicidae; Data; Detection; Disease; disorder control; Drosophila genus; Drosophila melanogaster; Ectopic Expression; Electrophysiology (science); Esthesia; Family; Family member; fly; Functional disorder; Genes; Glutamate Receptor; Glutamates; Health; Human; human disease; Image; Insect Vectors; Insecta; insight; Invertebrates; Kainic Acid Receptors; Ketamine; Knowledge; Life Cycle Stages; Mammalian Cell; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; member; Modeling; Molecular; Mosquito-borne infectious disease; mutant; Mutation; N-Methylaspartate; Neurons; neurotransmission; novel; Oocytes; Play; Protein Isoforms; Proteins; public health relevance; Rana; receptor; Reporting; research study; response; Role; sensor; sensory system; Synaptic Transmission; System; Temperature; Temperature Sense; Testing; Thermoreceptors; Tissues; Tsetse Flies; Work; ","New roles for chemoreceptor paralogues in Drosophila","113318","","","","S1","02","119","","119",""

Experiments described in the proposed study will examine the role of virulence factors (toxins) from these bacteria in host cell signalin and IL-1ß production in the cornea with the goal of identifying novel, targeted anti-inflammatory therapy that can be used for treatment during corneal infection.","2092680; ","PEARLMAN, ERIC ;","MCKIE, GEORGE ANN","04/01/2003","12/31/2018","Anti-inflammatory; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; ATP Receptors; Bacteria; Bacterial Infections; Binding; CASP1 gene; Cell Wall; Cells; Clinical; Collaborations; Cornea; Corneal Diseases; Corneal Ulcer; cytokine; Data; Developing Countries; Disease; experience; Genetic Transcription; Goals; Growth; Health; Hemolysin; Human; Immune response; Infection; Inflammatory; inhibitor/antagonist; Interleukin-1 beta; Keratitis; Leucocytic infiltrate; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; Methicillin; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; Muramidase; Mus; neutrophil; Neutrophil Infiltration; novel; P2X-receptor; Pain; pathogen; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pneumonia; Process; Production; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Purinoceptor; receptor; receptor binding; research study; RIPK2 gene; Role; Signal Transduction; Source; Staphylococcus aureus; Streptococcus pneumoniae; Streptococcus pneumoniae plY protein; Stress; Testing; Toll-like receptors; Toxin; Ulcer; Virulence Factors; Virulent; Vision; ","Toll Like Receptors in Bacterial Keratitis","014362","DPVS","Diseases and Pathophysiology of the Visual System Study Section ","","","14","225000","122625","347625",""

The World Health Organization has declared it a ?Public Health Emergency of International Concern? due to the association of Zika virus infection with microcephaly in babies and with Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults. An estimated four million Zika virus infections have occurred in the Americas in 2016 and over two billion people live in areas conducive to mosquito-borne transmission of Zika virus worldwide. Indigenous Zika virus infection has been reported in over 40 countries in the western hemisphere including the US protectorate of Puerto Rico and state of Florida. There is a clear need for accurate and practical methods of detecting Zika virus infection as well as for the development of therapeutic agents and vaccines to combat the associated disease. Detection of Zika virus infection is hampered, however, by the cross-reactivity of anti-Zika virus antibodies with other viruses present in the same areas including dengue virus and chikungunya virus.

Recent identification of rare mutations in the STAT5B gene in children exhibiting severe growth failure who were profoundly IGF-1 deficient, GH insensitive, and immune deficient, provides an unique opportunity to expand on these in vivo observations and study how STAT5b mediates GH signals for IGF-1 production.

Because the progress of the disease is variable, it is impossible to reason from how patients 'might have been' to determine if treatments worked or did not. Instead, a placebo-controlled trial is needed. We propose a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of tapering off the two most common medications for treating Alzheimer's dementia. The results will help establish guidelines about how and when medications should be continued or stopped.

Poor health literacy is estimated to cost the US economy from $106 billion to $238 billion annually. The Developing Skills in Health Literacy project provides students and teachers an engaging, online environment in which to learn how to evaluate the accuracy and usefulness of science and health information as well as the importance of biomedical research to health literacy.
