The major barrier or clinical challenge is that despite the recent advances in the understanding of the  biological basis of RCC, the management of the disease, especially in the advanced metastatic phase, remains a significant challenge. The rationale is that the c-Myc/HIF pathway is important in kidney cancer progression and metastasis. To address this problem, we will investigate the role of a set of miRNAs that directly target the c-Myc/HIF pathway and thereby inhibit kidney cancer progression and metastasis. Accomplishment of this study will be a significant step forward in understanding miRNA-mediated regulation of the c-Myc/HIF pathway and designing novel miRNA-based therapeutic strategies for metastatic kidney cancer among our Veterans.

The impacts of hearing loss on quality of life, psychological status and employability are of profound importance to veterans, since military service carries a high risk of SNHL. This risk is increasing rapidly, since the degree and nature of military noise exposure has worsened. In addition, SNHL and tinnitus are a high-probability consequence of blast injury. An unfortunately high percentage of military personnel returning from duty in the Middle East have significant SNHL, with threshold shift and/or tinnitus.

For reasons that are not clear, the prevalence of T2DM among people receiving care in the VA, ~20%, is at least twice that of the US population in general, 10%. Thus, diabetes is one of the major disease burdens for the VA health care system and a condition that has an enormous impact on morbidity, mortality and economic costs. Despite significant advances in diabetes care the incidence of diabetes continues to rise. Better interventions are needed to prevent and arrest the progression of the disease. The project described here will focus on the endogenous peptide GLP-1, a potent regulator of blood glucose that has been adapted to diabetes therapy.

This proposal seeks to improve suicide risk assessment for one of the most vulnerable, highest-risk populations known: patients recently discharged from psychiatric hospitalization. Our group has identified a novel predictor of suicidal ideation, a key component of suicide and suicidal behavior risk that patients sometimes fail to recognize or report. This predictor involves sophisticated analysis of patient movement data, and thus does not depend on patient self-report. We will expand and elaborate on our study in non-Veterans that showed a 'Resiliency Index' based on patient movement data correlated more strongly with suicidal ideation than any other characteristic. We will also examine the index's prediction of post-discharge suicidal behavior. Supported by VHA's Suicide Prevention Program, this study is a key step towards an integrated, multi-dimensional suicide risk assessment to protect our Veterans, especially those recently discharged from hospitalization.","10459959; ","SMITH, ERIC G.;","","10/01/2016","03/31/2020","actigraphy; Acute; Admission activity; Alcohols; Alzheimer's Disease; analog; Anxiety; base; Characteristics; Cohort Studies; Complement; Consent; Data; Devices; Diagnosis; Diagnostic; Distress; Drug Metabolic Detoxication; dysphoria; Enrollment; Equipment and supply inventories; Evaluation; Exclusion Criteria; Feeling suicidal; Health system; Healthcare; high risk; Hospitalization; Hour; ideation; improved; inclusion criteria; indexing; Inpatients; Intention; Investigation; K-Series Research Career Programs; Letters; Machine Learning; Massachusetts; Measurement; Measures; Mental Depression; Mental Health; Methods; Military Hospitals; monitoring device; Movement; movement analysis; neuropsychiatry; Nonlinear Dynamics; novel; Parkinson Disease; Participant; Patient Discharge; Patient risk; Patient Self-Report; Patients; Perception; Performance; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Population; Predictive Value; Prevention program; Principal Investigator; Procedures; prospective; Provider; Psyche structure; psychiatric symptom; Psychiatry; Psychotic Disorders; public health relevance; Recording of previous events; reducing suicide; Reporting; Research; Research Personnel; Risk; Risk Assessment; Role; Safety; Sampling; Schizoaffective Disorders; Schizophrenia; Sensitivity and Specificity; Severities; Signal Transduction; Specificity; Structure; Subgroup; suicidal; suicidal behavior; suicidal morbidity; suicidal risk; Suicide; Suicide prevention; Symptoms; Testing; Time; tool; Trees; Variant; Veterans; Visual; Wrist; ","Assessing Actigraphy-Determined Movement Variability as a Novel Objective Marker of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Risk in Veterans and Its Role in Integrated Suicide Risk Assessment","001424","MHBA","Mental Health and Behavioral Science A ","","","01","","","",""

There are currently no effective treatments for tauopathies; medications that prevent disease progression would have a significant and positive impact on Veterans' health. To address this challenge, we have developed a series of unique experimental models. The zebrafish shares numerous similarities in genetics and brain structure with humans. We have made zebrafish whose brains contain human Tau and proteins that glow different colors to indicate biochemical changes, allowing us to measure the abnormalities caused by Tau accumulation in the living brain cells of an intact animal for the first time. Coupled with a rapid testing platform for anti-Tau drugs, we will use these models to elucidate the biochemical events linking Tau accumulation to brain cell damage, and to discover novel treatments for tauopathy.","8125638; ","BURTON, EDWARD ALAN;","","10/01/2016","09/30/2020","Address; Alzheimer's Disease; Animals; Autopsy; base; Biochemical; Biochemistry; Bioenergetics; Biological Assay; Biological Models; Brain; brain cell; Cell Death; cell injury; Chronic; chronic traumatic encephalopathy; CNS degeneration; Color; Complex; Confocal Microscopy; Consensus; Coupled; Craniocerebral Trauma; Cultured Cells; Cytoplasmic Protein; Data; Dementia; Development; disability; Disease; Disease Progression; drug discovery; effective therapy; Employee Strikes; Event; Experimental Models; Frontotemporal Dementia; Genetic; genome wide association study; Glutathione; Haplotypes; Health; Human; Image; imaging modality; In Vitro; in vivo; insight; Intervention; Investigation; Lead; Life; Link; Literature; MAPT gene; Measures; Mediator of activation protein; Membrane; Methods; Mitochondria; mitochondrial dysfunction; Mitochondrial Proteins; Modeling; Molecular; Molecular Target; Motor; Mutation; Nerve Degeneration; nervous system disorder; neurobehavioral; Neurodegenerative Disorders; Neurologic; neuron loss; Neuronal Dysfunction; Neurons; neuropathology; neurotoxic; novel; novel strategies; Nuclear; oculomotor; Outer Mitochondrial Membrane; overexpression; oxidation; Oxidation-Reduction; oxidative damage; Oxidative Stress; Pathogenesis; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phenocopy; Phenotype; Pigments; prevent; Production; Progressive Supranuclear Palsy; protein complex; protein function; Protein Import; protein oligomer; Proteins; public health relevance; Publishing; ratiometric; Reactive Oxygen Species; Reagent; Reporter; Reporting; Research; research study; Respiratory physiology; risk variant; Series; small molecule; small molecule libraries; Specimen; Structure; Symptoms; tau aggregation; tau mutation; tau Proteins; Tauopathies; Testing; Therapeutic; therapeutic development; therapeutic target; Time; Tissues; Transgenic Organisms; translocase; Variant; Veterans; Zebrafish; ","Pathogenesis and drug discovery for tauopathy","003168","NURD","Neurobiology D ","","A1","01","","","",""

Obesity and the metabolic syndrome are all significantly increased in the veteran population and are a major health problem. An important manifestation of this is non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is now the most common liver disease in the veteran population and can progress to cirrhosis and liver cancer. NASH results in a very high degree of morbidity due to fatigue, jaundice, ankle swelling and itching. In addition NASH also results in increased mortality due to cirrhosis, hepatocellular cancer as well as liver failure.  Currently there are no  effective treatments for NASH. During this Merit Review Award we have identified many of the cellular pathways responsible for the sterile liver inflammation that causes NASH. We now propose to identify how these pathways are activated, and to test inhibitors of these pathways to allow for the development of specific therapy for NASH.","6490737; ","MEHAL, WAJAHAT ZAFAR;","","10/01/2016","09/30/2020","Acute; Ankle; Anti-inflammatory; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Award; Biochemical; cell free DNA; Cell Line; Cells; Cessation of life; Characteristics; Cirrhosis; Clinical Trials; cytokine; Data; Development; DNA; DNA receptor; effective therapy; Etiology; Fatigue; Fatty Liver; feeding; Grant; Health; Healthcare; Hepatocyte; Human; Icterus; immune activation; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Inflammatory Response; inhibitor/antagonist; Interleukin-1 beta; Investigation; Kupffer Cells; Ligands; Liver; Liver diseases; Liver Failure; liver inflammation; liver injury; macrophage; Malignant neoplasm of liver; Malignant Neoplasms; Metabolic syndrome; Mitochondria; Mitochondrial DNA; Modeling; Molecular; monocyte; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; mouse model; Mus; nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; Obesity; oxidation; Pancreas; Pathway interactions; Patients; Phase; Phase I/II Trial; Plasma; Plasma Cells; Population; Primary carcinoma of the liver cells; Production; Pruritus; Publications; receptor; Reporter; Role; Safety; Source; Sterility; Swelling; Testing; Tissues; Up-Regulation; Veterans; Work; ","Cell-free DNA is a driver of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis via TLR9 activation","003259","GAST","Gastroenterology ","","A1","01","","","",""

Since SP-C is made and secreted by alveolar type 2 epithelial cells, SP-C mutations can be used as model substrates to probe the role of epithelial cell dysfunction in ILD pathogenesis. Using novel cell systems and mouse models expressing these mutations we will characterize molecular mechanisms regulating cellular quality control responses (e.g. the unfolded protein response, proteasomal degradation, autophagy) used by epithelial cells for maintenance of homeostasis in health and how their failure contributes to ILD development.

One area of unmet need is to develop new `anabolic' therapies for severe osteoporosis. The goal of this project is to test whether the unique pharmacodynamic properties of a `biased' agonist of the type 1 parathyroid hormone receptor (PTH1R) enables it to circumvent the limitations of current therapeutics. Each of three specific aims compares conventional and biased PTH1R agonists in a different pre-clinical rodent model of metabolic bone disease to test whether biased agonism affords specific advantages in terms of reduced side effects and retained effectiveness in settings where a conventional PTH1R agonist is ineffective or contraindicated.

As these military personnel retire from their active duty, the consequences of TBI will become major problems for the Veterans health system.

Therefore, prevention of HF is essential. HF prevention is a critical issue for the veteran population, in whom HF risk factors that include common medical conditions such as hypertension and diabetes are highly prevalent. However, not everyone with these risk factors develops HF. Using novel blood tests, we propose to identify and treat veterans at higher HF risk to see if we can stabilize or improve ultrasound measures known to be associated with HF risk.

In this proposal we study the genetic determinants of the response to treatments for diabetes ((pharmacogenomics metformin) and kidney transplant (tacrolimus) and the genetic determinants of hypertension.

We developed an acupuncture (ACU) treatment for PTSD in order to broaden treatment options. Our first study showed that it helped most people. However, we need better scientific evidence that it works by comparing ACU to a placebo, such as 'sham' acupuncture (fewer needles in non-important sites) and determining if ACU alters abnormal physiology in PTSD. In this study 90 Veterans will be randomly assigned (like a coin flip) to receive either ACU or sham.

In addition, the population of obese older veterans is rapidly increasing as more baby boomers become senior citizens. In older veterans, obesity exacerbates the age- related decline in physical function and causes frailty which predisposes to admission to a VA chronic care facility. However, the optimal clinical approach to obesity in older adults is controversial because of the concern that weight loss therapy could be harmful by aggravating the age-related loss of muscle mass and bone mass. In fact, the MOVE (Managing Overweight/Obese Veterans) program does not have any guidelines for eligible veterans if they are 70 or older. It is possible that the addition of testosterone replacement to lifestyle therapy will preserve muscle mass and bone mass and reverse frailty in obese older veterans and thus prevent their loss of independence and decrease demand for VA health care services.","6487786; ","VILLAREAL, DENNIS T.;","","04/01/2014","12/31/2017","Admission activity; Adult; Affect; Age; age related; Aging; American; Anabolism; base; Biological Preservation; Body Weight decreased; bone; Bone Density; bone mass; bone quality; Bone Resorption; Chronic; Chronic Care; Clinical; comparative efficacy; cytokine; Data; Diet; Double-Blind Method; Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry; efficacy trial; Elderly; Equilibrium; Exercise; exercise training; Failure; Fatty acid glycerol esters; Frail Elderly; frailty; functional outcomes; functional status; Future; Gene Expression; General Population; Geometry; Goals; Growth; Guidelines; Health; health care service; Healthcare; Healthcare Systems; Hip region structure; hormone deficiency; Hormones; Hyperphagia; improved; Inflammation; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I; Interleukin-6; Intervention; Intramuscular; lean body mass; Life Style; lifestyle intervention; Lifestyle Therapy; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; male; Mediating; Medical; Methods; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; multi-component intervention; Muscle; muscle form; muscle strength; neglect; novel; Nursing Homes; Obesity; obesity treatment; older men; older patient; Osteogenesis; Osteopenia; Outcome; Overweight; Patients; Performance; performance tests; Physical Function; Physical Performance; Placebo Control; Placebos; Population; Prevalence; prevent; programs; protein expression; Protein Isoforms; Public Health; Quality of life; Randomized; reduced muscle mass; restoration; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; sarcopenia; sarcopenic obesity; sedentary lifestyle; Serum; Skeletal Muscle; standard care; standard of care; success; Testing; Testosterone; testosterone replacement therapy; Thigh structure; Tissue Sample; TNF gene; treatment group; Veterans; Weight; Western Blotting; X-Ray Computed Tomography; ","Testosterone Replacement to Augment Lifestyle Therapy in Obese Older Veterans","000906","ENDA","Endocriniology A ","","","03","","","",""

Mood disorders are among the most common of these diagnoses, and leading causes of death and disability. Furthermore, the V.A. spends billions of dollars per year on healthcare for veterans with these disorders. The biological basis of mood disorders is poorly understood, however, and novel approaches are needed. Dysfunction of circadian (ca. 24 hr) biological rhythms has been suspected for many years to play a role in mood disorders. With recent developments in circadian biology, it is now possible to test the function of the circadian clock a the molecular level in cells cultured from human patient skin samples, or in brain cells from mouse models of mood disorders, where the clocks can also be manipulated. The studies proposed here, by delineating the role of circadian clocks in depression, could lead to improved treatments for this common disorder afflicting our nation's veterans.","1864336; ","WELSH, DAVID K;","","01/01/2012","09/30/2020","Afghanistan; base; Behavior; Biological; Biological Clocks; Biological Rhythm; Biology; Bioluminescence; Body Temperature; Brain; brain cell; Brain region; Cause of Death; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell Nucleus; Cell physiology; Cells; cellular imaging; circadian pacemaker; Circadian Rhythms; Clinical; Clinical Research; Clock protein; common treatment; CREB1 gene; cryptochrome; Data; Defect; depressed patient; Development; Diagnosis; Diagnostic; disability; Disease; Dominant-Negative Mutation; Exhibits; Failure; Fibroblasts; Firefly Luciferases; Functional disorder; Gene Expression; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Polymorphism; Goals; Healthcare; Human; Hypothalamic structure; Image; Image Analysis; improved; Injection of therapeutic agent; Internships; Iraq; knock-down; Knock-in; Lead; Learned Helplessness; Lentivirus Vector; Major Depressive Disorder; Measures; Melatonin; Mental Depression; Mental Health; Molecular; Monitor; Mood Disorders; mood regulation; Moods; Motor Activity; mouse model; Mus; mutant; Neurons; novel strategies; Nucleus Accumbens; Patients; Periodicity; Phase; Phenotype; Play; public health relevance; Reporter; Reporter Genes; Repression; Research Design; Research Methodology; Resistance; response; Rewards; Rodent; Rodent Model; Role; Sampling; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Skin; Sleep Disorders; Slice; Source; suprachiasmatic nucleus; Testing; Therapeutic; Time; tool; Veterans; Viral Vector; ","Cellular Circadian Clocks in Mood Disorders","001146","NURR","Neurobiology R ","","A1","05","","","",""

The Kern laboratory has focused on learning how diabetic retinopathy develops and can be inhibited.

Persistent microbial lung infections in immunocompetent or mildly immunocompromised veterans results in chronic lung disease. Antibiotic therapies are often inadequate; thus enhanced knowledge of pulmonary host defense is essential for the development of new therapies or vaccine strategies to treat these patient populations. Strategies designed to diminish or enhance immunomodulatory pathways hold the greatest promise for enhancing therapies of persistent infections, malignancy, allergies, autoimmune disease, or organ transplants.

Although metformin is first line treatment for patients with DM, many patients with moderate CKD do not receive metformin due to concerns for lactic acidosis, a rare but serious outcome. Our group and others have demonstrated that among patients without CKD, metformin use is associated with cardiovascular, kidney, and survival advantages compared with sulfonylureas. The rapidly increasing number of patients with DM and moderate CKD may also derive cardiovascular and renal benefits from metformin. Evidence on the advantages and risks of metformin versus sulfonylureas in those with moderate CKD is urgently needed but currently lacking. We will conduct a national retrospective cohort study of approximately 40,000 new users of metformin and 75,000 new users of sulfonylureas with Stage 3 CKD to answer these clinical questions.

More than 21% of US veterans have some form of chronic renal failure due to hypertension or diabetes, and despite medical intervention many progress to dialysis. Total Medicare expenditures for ESRD in 2010 grew by 8% to $33 billion, and the Veterans Health Administration bears a disproportional financial burden for dialysis services. Although transplantation leads to improved survival, renal disease will continue to be a major public health problem due to shortage of organs for transplantation. New advances in genomic and personalized medicine have opened the door to now understand the interaction between stem cells and the 3D extracellular matrix, to delineate the requirements for cellular maturation. By providing a template to develop tissues for transplantation from a patient's own cells, the implication of this technology is to eliminate long waitlist times and waitlist mortality, reduce the reliance on organs from living donors, and potentially obviate the need for immunosuppression.","1873462; ","WERTHEIM, JASON A;","","10/01/2016","09/30/2020","Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis; Address; Adult; Affect; American; base; Binding; Biological Markers; Biomedical Engineering; Bioreactors; Bladder; Bladder Dysfunction; Cardiovascular system; Cell Differentiation process; Cell Maturation; cell type; Cells; Chronic Kidney Failure; Clinical; Coculture Techniques; Collagen; Communities; Complex; Controlled Environment; Cues; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetic ulcer; Dialysis procedure; Differentiation and Growth; E-Cadherin; Elderly; Elements; embryonic stem cell; End stage renal failure; Environment; Evaluation; Excision; Expenditure; Extracellular Matrix; FGF2 gene; Fibroblasts; Future; General Population; Goals; Growth; Growth Factor Gene; Health; health administration; Hemodialysis; High Prevalence; high throughput screening; Human; Hypertension; improved; In Vitro; Individual; induced pluripotent stem cell; injured; Injury; innovation; Intercellular Junctions; Intervention; Investigation; Kidney; Kidney Diseases; Kidney Failure; Kidney Transplantation; Laboratories; Laminin; Ligands; Living Donors; Mediating; Medical; Medicare; Mesenchyme; Methods; Modeling; Modification; Monitor; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Natural immunosuppression; Nephrons; Organ; Organ Culture Techniques; Organ Size; Organ Transplantation; Organogenesis; Paracrine Communication; Pathway interactions; Patients; Peptides; Perfusion; Peripheral Vascular Diseases; personalized genomic medicine; Pluripotent Stem Cells; Population; prevent; Process; progenitor; Public Health; public health relevance; reconstitution; Renal function; Renal Tissue; Renal tubule structure; repaired; response; Rodent; Role; scaffold; Services; Signal Transduction; Skin; Staging; stem; stem cell biology; Stem Cell Development; stem cell differentiation; stem cell technology; Stem cells; Structural Genes; System; Technology; Testing; Therapeutic Uses; three dimensional cell culture; Time; Tissue Engineering; tissue regeneration; tissue support frame; Tissue Transplantation; Tissues; tool; Transplantation; two-dimensional; Ursidae Family; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors; Veterans; ","Extracellular Matrix Induction of Renal Stem and Progenitor Cell Development","002660","NEPH","Nephrology ","","A2","01","","","",""

Mild TBI is a clinical diagnosis, and currently no criteria exist to predict who will continue to experience debilitating neurological symptoms. There is a pressing need for more effective, mechanistic-based therapies for the treatment of TBI and associated post-concussive symptoms. Our research aims to 1) quantify electroencephalographic (EEG)-based markers of sleep and wakefulness in TBI that can aid in the prediction of functional recovery, 2) evaluate brain glutamate changes during wakefulness in TBI, and 3) evaluate the mechanisms by which a promising dietary therapy composed of branched chain amino acids restores glutamate and wakefulness in TBI.","6841556; ","LIM, MIRANDA M;","","10/01/2015","09/30/2020","Attention; base; Behavior; behavioral impairment; Brain; Brain Injuries; Brain region; Branched-Chain Amino Acids; Chronic; clinical Diagnosis; Cognitive; cognitive recovery; common symptom; Communities; community reintegration; Comorbidity; Data; Development; Diet; disability; effective therapy; Electroencephalography; Electron Microscopy; Electrophysiology (science); Employment; Event; Excessive Daytime Sleepiness; experience; extracellular; Functional disorder; gamma-Aminobutyric Acid; Glutamates; Goals; hypocretin; Hypothalamic structure; Impaired cognition; Impairment; improved; in vivo; Individual; Link; Measures; Memory; Microdialysis; mild traumatic brain injury; mouse model; Mus; Nerve; neurobehavioral; Neurologic; Neurons; neuropsychiatry; new therapeutic target; novel strategies; Outcome; Pattern; persistent symptom; Physiological; Play; Population; Post-Concussion Syndrome; prevent; public health relevance; Recovery; Recovery of Function; Rehabilitation therapy; Research; Role; Sleep; Sleep Wake Cycle; Symptoms; Synapses; Techniques; temporal measurement; Testing; Therapeutic Intervention; therapeutic target; Traumatic Brain Injury; Traumatic Brain Injury recovery; Veterans; Wakefulness; Work; ","Sleep-wake disturbances in traumatic brain injury","002712","NURR","Neurobiology R ","","","02","","","",""

A pharmacological treatment for the social deficits of schizophrenia would have considerable benefit for patients, their families, society, and the VA healthcare system. The pro-social neuropeptide oxytocin is a promising treatment for social deficits in schizophrenia.

Also, diabetes acts as a risk factor for renal cancer, the incidence of which increases from age 30 and peaks at 6th decade.

Complications from diabetic wounds cost over $1.5 billion annually. The progression to major amputation is extremely high in diabetics with ~84% of all amputations being preceded by a nonhealing diabetic ulcer. In the VA population, the incidence of diabetes is 3 fold higher and, with a combination of poor social support and self-care, the incidence of major limb amputation is excessive. Despite decades of research, very little impact has been made on improving healing in these patients. The goal of our proposal is to investigate the role of an enzyme called xanthine oxidoreductase that is abundant in wounds and can produce nitric oxide from a stable compound called nitrite. We will determine if XOR can be harnessed to deliver nitric oxide to improve diabetic wound healing. We will characterize XOR expression in human wound tissues from different wound etiologies that may also be amenable to nitrite therapy. Such a therapy would be very inexpensive and safe.","1890322; ","TZENG, EDITH ;","","10/01/2016","09/30/2020","Address; Affect; Amputation; Attention; Back; Biological Availability; Blood Vessels; Caring; cell injury; Cell Proliferation; chronic wound; Complex; cost; Data; Diabetes Mellitus; diabetic; Diabetic mouse; diabetic patient; Diabetic ulcer; Diabetic wound; diabetic wound healing; Dietary Nitrite; direct application; disability; Disease; Disease model; Dose; Endothelial Cells; Enzymes; Etiology; Event; Foot Ulcer; Foundations; Functional disorder; Generations; genetic manipulation; Goals; Half-Life; Healed; healing; Healthcare; Healthcare Systems; Human; human tissue; Hypoxia; Impaired wound healing; Impairment; improved; Incidence; Infection; Inflammation; inhibitor/antagonist; Injury; Intervention; Ischemia; Knockout Mice; Lead; Leg Ulcer; limb amputation; Lower Extremity; Mediating; Microvascular Dysfunction; Minor; Modality; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; mouse model; Mus; NADPH Oxidase; neovascularization; Neuropathy; Nitric Oxide; Nitric Oxide Synthase; Nitrite Reductase; Nitrites; Obesity; Organism; Oxidants; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidative Stress; Oxidoreductase; oxidoreductase inhibitor; Pathogenesis; Patient Care; Patients; Phase I Clinical Trials; Play; Population; Predisposition; Process; Production; productivity loss; Property; public health relevance; Pulmonary Hypertension; Reactive Oxygen Species; Reporting; Research; restenosis; Risk; Role; safety testing; Self Care; Sickle Cell; Skin; Social support; Sodium Nitrite; Source; stem; Supplementation; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Agents; Time; Tissues; Translating; Translations; Ulcer; United States; vasoconstriction; Venous; Work; wound; Wound Healing; XDH gene; ","Xanthine oxidoreductase in impaired diabetic wound healing.","001466","SURG","Surgery ","","A1","01","","","",""

Lifelong effects of this disease include expensive medical treatments, hospitalization, surgery, disability and increased risk of colon cancer. For many patients, oral steroids are the first-line treatment for UC. Although steroids are effective in reducing overt symptoms, studies have shown that approximately half of all patients are refractory to steroid treatment, with limited ulcer healing. We have identified a new type of intestinal stem cell that i involved in healing ulcers. The goal of this project is to identify which types of cells are involvd in ulcer healing, and to understand how the activity of those cells is regulated. Additionally, we propose to investigate how steroids influence stem cell activity and limit ulcer healing.

Studies from the Veterans Administration showed that patients with cirrhosis and superimposed alcoholic hepatitis had > 60% mortality over a four-year period of time, with most of those deaths occurring in the first few months. Thus, the prognosis for this stage of ALD is worse than many common types of cancer, such as breast, prostate and colon. Unfortunately, there is no FDA-approved therapy for any stage of ALD, and this makes the need for this proposed research even more compelling.

This proposal aims to use vectored immunoprophylaxis (VIP) encoding bNAbs as an immunotherapeutic for both suppressed and active HIV-1 replication in a humanized mouse model infection and to determine its impact on the functionality of the immune system in order to establish VIP as an alternative therapeutic modality for HIV-1 infected individuals.","12221744; ","DEAL, CAILIN ;","CONLEY, TONY J.","09/01/2016","08/31/2019","active control; Acute; adaptive immunity; adeno-associated viral vector; Adherence; Alternative Therapies; Animal Model; Animals; Anti-Retroviral Agents; Antibodies; Antigens; Antiviral Therapy; base; Biology; Bone Marrow; Bypass; CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes; Cell Count; Cells; Cessation of life; Characteristics; Clinical; clinical efficacy; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials; clinically relevant; cost; Dependovirus; Engraftment; Epitopes; exhaustion; Exhibits; Functional disorder; Future; Genes; Half-Life; Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy; HIV; HIV Infections; HIV-1; Human; humanized mouse; Hybrids; Immune; immune function; Immune response; Immune system; immunogenicity; immunoprophylaxis; Immunotherapeutic agent; Immunotherapy; In Vitro; in vivo; Individual; Infection; Infection Control; Investigation; Laboratories; Lead; Liver; Macaca mulatta; Mediating; Modality; Modeling; Monkeys; Monoclonal Antibodies; Monoclonal Antibody Therapy; mouse model; Mus; neutralizing antibody; neutralizing monoclonal antibodies; nonhuman primate; novel; novel therapeutics; Passive Immunotherapy; Patients; Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase; pill; Plasma; prevent; Regimen; research study; Resistance; Resources; response; Serum; SIV; success; System; T-Lymphocyte; Testing; Therapeutic; Thymus Gland; Time; transmission process; Vaccine Antigen; vector; Viral; Viral Load result; viral resistance; Viral Vector; Virus; Virus Replication; ","The Use of Monoclonal Antibodies Delivered by Viral Vector as an HIV-1 Therapeutic","125096","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","A1","01","56118","","56118",""

A newly developed treatment using cognitive rehabilitation and exposure therapy (Cognitive Rehabilitation and Exposure/Sorting Therapy; CREST) could result in symptom severity reduction. Although this line of work is promising, further investigation of efficacy, moderators, mediators, and mechanisms of change during treatment is needed. We propose to examine CREST compared to exposure therapy alone in a sample of 136 Veterans with HD. This randomized controlled trial will explore hoarding severity reduction (primary) as well as quality o life and functional capacity changes (secondary). Treatment predictors, moderators, and maximum time to treatment effect will also be investigated.

Our research found that the aged heart is intrinsically more susceptible to injury during a heart attack. This increased risk is due to dysfunctional mitochondria, the ?powerhouses? of the heart cell. During a heart attack, these deranged mitochondria lead to heart cell death, in part by injuring other cell organelles, serving to amplify cell injury.

It increases the risk of kidney disease, stroke, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure and mortality. Reducing blood pressure to normal levels decreases the morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension, but does not reduce it to background levels. The etiology underlying the development of hypertension is unknown, but investigators have demonstrated that suppressed renal prostaglandin metabolism induces sodium retention, a critical first step to become hypertensive. In this research application, we identify a novel mechano-sensor in kidney that is dysregulated by cholesterol, leads to suppressed prostaglandin synthesis, renal Na retention and hypertension. By elucidating the mechanisms by which cholesterol represses the flow activation of this mechano-sensor in the kidney, we can causally link hypercholesterolemia to the epidemic of hypertension and develop novel targets to treat hypertension.","1953360; ","ROHATGI, RAJEEV ;","","10/01/2016","09/30/2020","absorption; Acute; Adult; Affect; Apical; Arterioloscleroses; autocrine; Avidity; base; BIK gene; Blood; Blood Pressure; blood pressure reduction; Blood Vessels; Calcium; Cations; caveolin 1; Cell membrane; Cells; chelation; Cholesterol; Chronic; Congestive Heart Failure; Consumption; Coronary Arteriosclerosis; Cyclodextrins; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; diabetic; Diabetic Nephropathy; Diet; Dietary Cholesterol; Dinoprostone; Disease; Distal; Diuretics; Duct (organ) structure; Endothelium; environmental change; Epidemic; Epithelial; Epithelium; Erythrocytes; Essential Hypertension; Etiology; Excretory function; feeding; flotillin; fluid flow; Functional disorder; Homeostasis; Human; Hyperaldosteronism; hypercholesterolemia; Hypertension; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; Ingestion; insulin secretion; Ion Transport; Kidney; Kidney Diseases; Kidney Failure; Link; Liquid substance; Mechanics; Mediating; Membrane Microdomains; Metabolism; mitogen-activated protein kinase p38; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Mus; Natriuresis; Nephrons; Nitric Oxide; novel; Organ; paracrine; Phenotype; Phosphorylation; PKD2 protein; Play; Population; Prostaglandins; PTGS2 gene; public health relevance; Rattus; receptor; Receptor Signaling; Regulation; renal epithelium; Research; Research Personnel; response; Rest; Risk; Rodent; Role; Saline; salt sensitive; sensor; Sensory; shear stress; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Sodium; stroke; Testing; Tissues; Tubular formation; Vascular Diseases; Vasodilation; Viscosity; ","Lipid Rafts:  Mechanosensors of the distal nephron","003015","NEPH","Nephrology ","","A2","01","","","",""

It is seen more commonly in individuals who have served in the military, and thus is of particular interest to the Department of Veterans Affairs. The prevalence of OA is increasing rapidly; it is projected that by 2030, over 60 million Americans will be affected. Current treatments for OA are only marginally effective in treating pain, and none have been shown to alter the progression of OA. Degenerative joint cartilage is a central feature of OA, yet joint cartilage has a limited capacity for repair. Results from animal research demonstrate that pulsed low intensity ultrasound (PLIUS) mechanically stimulates, and may promote, cartilage repair. This exploratory trial will investigate whether PLIUS is potentially effective as a disease and symptom modifying intervention in 160 patients with early knee OA. If sufficient evidence of efficacy is observed, it would strongly support further clinic research in humans. If efficacy is subsequently confirmed after more definitive clinical trials, the standard of care for this highly prevalent and debilitating disease could radically change.","1999244 (contact); 1895478; 6084963; ","CLEGG, DANIEL O (contact); KWOH, C KENT; LEE, SUSAN JUNG-AH;","","10/01/2014","09/30/2019","Address; Affect; Age; American; Animal Experimentation; arm; Arthritis; articular cartilage; attenuation; base; Basic Science; bench to bedside; Biological Markers; Bone Marrow; Cartilage; cartilage degradation; cartilage regeneration; cartilage repair; Cavia; Chondrocytes; Cities; Clinic; Clinical; Clinical Data; Clinical Trials; Controlled Clinical Trials; cost; Data; Degenerative polyarthritis; Development; Devices; disability; Disease; Disease Marker; Double-blind trial; effective therapy; Engineering; Enrollment; experience; FDA approved; Fracture; Fracture Healing; Gold; Health; Human; Image; improved; indexing; Individual; innovation; interest; Intervention; Joints; Knee; Knee Osteoarthritis; knee pain; knee replacement arthroplasty; Lesion; Light; Literature; Lower Extremity; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Measures; Mechanical Stimulation; Medial; Medical; Medical center; meetings; member; Metabolism; Military Personnel; Modality; Modeling; Modification; Nature; novel; Orthopedics; Outcome; Pain; Pain management; Pathogenesis; Patients; Phase; Physiologic pulse; pilot trial; Placebos; pre-clinical; preclinical study; Prevalence; primary outcome; Procedures; Production; Publishing; Quality of life; Randomized; Recruitment Activity; reduce symptoms; repaired; Research; response; Running; Scientist; screening; Serum; Services; Severities; Sodium Chloride; Staging; standard of care; Structure; symptomatic improvement; Symptoms; System; Therapeutic; Thick; Time; treatment duration; treatment group; Ultrasonography; Urine; Veterans; Weight-Bearing state; Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index; Work; ","A Pilot Trial to Assess Low-Intensity Ultrasound in Osteoarthritis","000954","CLIN","Clinical Trials ","","","03","","","",""

Therefore, there is an urgent need for translational research identifying prevention strategies, through understanding molecular mechanisms associated with the progression from adenoma to invasive cancer.
