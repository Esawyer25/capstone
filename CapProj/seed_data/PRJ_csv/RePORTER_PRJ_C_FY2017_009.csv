It is largely controversial whether the observed inverse association is due to the biological 'genuine' effects of BMI or systematic biases. By developing a novel and efficient statistical approach for Mendelian Randomization and taking advantage of existing individual GWAS and detailed epidemiologic data from about 20,000 lung cancer cases and 20,000 controls in TRICL (Transdisciplinary Research in Cancer of the Lung), this project will evaluate the causal role of obesity traits in lung cancer without the biases that  usually plague observational epidemiological studies. This study will therefore potentially have a significant public health impact by addressing an important and controversial question about the etiology of lung cancer that, so far, has not been addressed adequately, opening new avenue for further studies in understanding the etiology of lung cancer, and providing important statistical tools for facilitating investigation of the causal relationship between risk factors an complex diseases in general.","1955350; 9233539 (contact); ","HO, GLORIA YUEN FUN; WANG, TAO  (contact);","VERMA, MUKESH ","12/11/2015","11/30/2017","Accounting; Address; Affect; base; Biological; Body mass index; Body Weight decreased; cancer risk; cancer type; Colon Carcinoma; Complex; cost efficient; Data; Development; Disease; Endometrial Carcinoma; epidemiologic data; Epidemiologic Studies; Etiology; Future; Genes; Genetic; genetic variant; genome wide association study; genome-wide; Heritability; improved; Individual; Inherited; instrument; interest; Investigation; Knowledge; Lead; Link; malignant breast neoplasm; Malignant neoplasm of lung; Malignant Neoplasms; Methods; Modeling; novel; Obesity; Plague; prospective; protective effect; Public Health; public health relevance; Randomized; Research; Residual state; Resources; Risk; Risk Factors; Role; Sample Size; simulation; Smoking; Smoking Status; Statistical Methods; Subgroup; Systematic Bias; Time; tool; trait; waist circumference; Waist-Hip Ratio; Weight; Weight Gain; ","Develop and Apply a Novel Genome-wide Mendelian Randomization Method to Examine Relationship between Obesity and Lung Cancer","202529","ZCA1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","122313","77654","199967",""

More people die from cholera than die waiting for an organ transplant in the USA. Transplant research is funded in the hundreds of millions of dollars ? not so for cholera vaccine development. It is time to normalize the research efforts to the number of people that are dying and or acutely ill rather than those who can pay for the biomedical research derived services. A glaring unmet need for cholera vaccines is a one dose vaccine that effectively immunize the young. Dr. R. Hall, NIH, Program Officer, laments the lack of new idea being studied or proposed in cholera vaccine research. This critique does not include my group. We are investigating pediatric cholera vaccines based on a novel LPS epitope that is part of a conjugate vaccine formulation. Our current proposal aims to take advantage of the adjuvant properties of Vc flagellar proteins that bind toll like receptor 5 (TLR5) and induce pro-inflammatory cytokines that enhance antigen presentation. This is often a difficult first step of the immune response non-invasive pathogens like Vc ? how to get the right antigen in, in immunogenic form. Vc flagellins are immunogenic in people and induce protective antibodies in animal.

Approximately 50% of adult burn trauma patients consumed alcohol prior to sustaining their injuries. Both burn and alcohol exposure independently alter the ability of macrophages to function appropriately in their pivotal role to initiate and resolve inflammation, and combining th two insults results in a more dramatic skewing of macrophage function leaving the host susceptible to bacterial pathogens, which is the focus of this proposal. Findings from these studies may also be helpful in treating other disease conditions involving aberrant pulmonary inflammatory responses ranging from asthma to fibrotic disorders as well as inflammatory disorders outside the lung.","1862316; ","KOVACS, ELIZABETH J;","SOMERS, SCOTT D.","08/01/1999","03/31/2019","Accounting; Acute Lung Injury; Adoptive Transfer; Adult; Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome; Agonist; Alcohol consumption; alcohol effect; alcohol exposure; alcohol-related injury; Alcoholic Intoxication; Alcohols; Alveolar Macrophages; Animals; Anti-inflammatory; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; arginase; Asthma; Bacteria; Binding; Breathing; Bronchoalveolar Lavage; Burn injury; Burn Trauma; Cause of Death; Cell physiology; Cells; chemokine; chromatin immunoprecipitation; Clinical; clinically relevant; combat; cost; Country; Cues; cytokine; Data; Dichloromethylene Diphosphonate; Disease; drinking; Economic Burden; Ethanol; Exhibits; Goals; Hamman-Rich syndrome; Health; health economics; Heart Diseases; Homeostasis; Hospitalization; Hospitals; Host Defense; Immune; immune function; Impairment; improved; Infection; Inflammation; Inflammation Mediators; Inflammatory; Inflammatory Response; injured; Injury; insight; Interleukin-10; Interleukin-6; Intoxication; Knock-out; knockout animal; Knockout Mice; Left; Life; Liposomes; Lung; Lung Inflammation; macrophage; Malignant Neoplasms; Methodology; Modeling; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Mus; neutrophil; pathogen; Pathway interactions; Patient Care; patient population; Patients; Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors; Phagocytosis; Phenotype; Play; PPAR gamma; Production; promoter; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; pulmonary function; Pulmonary Inflammation; Recovery; Reporting; Resolution; respiratory; Respiratory physiology; response; Role; rosiglitazone; Serum; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; STAT3 gene; Testing; therapy development; Time; Tissues; Trauma patient; Traumatic injury; United States; Wild Type Mouse; Work; ","Ethanol Effects on Recovery after Injury","115257","SAT","Surgery, Anesthesiology and Trauma Study Section ","","","16","265000","147075","412075",""
