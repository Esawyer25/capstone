The major goal of the CRP funding is to manufacture sufficient clinical material for Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials.

We propose to harness the exquisite specificity of bispecific antibodies in order to generate bispecific antibody drug conjugates that selectively deliver LRAs to the fraction of cells harboring latent HIV while minimizing LRA exposure to the majority of cells in the body that do not harbor latent HIV. Our approach has the potential for highly specific and potent activation of HIV reservoir cells that could also markedly increase the therapeutic index of LRAs by several orders of magnitude, and it is our belief that one or several of our engineered bispecific antibody drug conjugates could become a key component in a multi-pronged approach to eliminating the latent reservoir and curing HIV-1 infection.","1858789; ","HO, DAVID D;","LACOURCIERE, GERARD ","07/25/2017","06/30/2022","Affinity; Agonist; antibody engineering; Antibody-drug conjugates; antiretroviral therapy; Avidity; Belief; Binding; Biological Assay; Bispecific Antibodies; Blood; Bromodomain; Cathartics; Cell Count; Cell Fraction; Cell Line; cell type; Cells; cellular targeting; Clinical; Clinical Trials; clinically relevant; Dose; Engineering; experience; Exposure to; falls; Fluorescein; Histone Deacetylase; Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor; HIV; HIV Infections; HIV-1; humanized mouse; IL2RB gene; In Vitro; in vitro activity; in vivo; Individual; Infection; inhibitor/antagonist; interest; Laboratories; Measures; Memory; Monoclonal Antibodies; mouse model; novel strategies; Outcome; Pathway interactions; Patients; Population; Property; Protein Kinase C; Proviruses; PTEN gene; purge; Reporting; Rest; Sleep; Specificity; Stem cells; Surface; systemic toxicity; T memory cell; Therapeutic Index; Tissues; TNFRSF6 gene; Toxic effect; Variant; Viral; viral rebound; Viremia; Virus; ","Bispecific-Antibody-Drug Conjugates for Selective Targeting and Activation of the HIV Latent Reservoir","134328","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","300734","294419","595153",""

The safety of a TDF/3TC/EFV based regimen used during pregnancy has not been systematically evaluated. The drug combination of TDF/3TC/EFV may develop HIV resistance easily if the women do not adhere to the medication and second line treatment may be required for subsequent pregnancies. Like the first line regimen, the safety of the second line treatment using Atazanavir/ritonavir during pregnancy has not be critically evaluated. The proposed study will take place at four high volume antenatal sites within Lilongwe, Malawi where UNC project and the Baylor Tingathe Program have established infrastructure. We will enroll newly identified HIV infected women at the first antenatal visit and follow maternal and infant outcomes through year 3 post-delivery. Additionally, we will measure the prevalence of treatment failure among women on ART presenting with subsequent pregnancies to assess the need for second line therapy.

Large animal models that recapitulate the complex motor and cognitive disease phenotypes, and associated neuropathology, observed in human HD patients are severely lacking. The proposed research in the current application will use state-of- the-art neuroscience technologies (resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging, touchscreen behavioral analyses and electrophysiological techniques) in a novel non-human primate model of HD recently created in our laboratory to 1) study alterations in functional brain connectivity in these animals and 2) correlate changes in brain connectivity to the progressive development of behavioral phenotypes and related neuropathology germane to this monkey model of HD.","6576099; ","MCBRIDE, JODI L.;","MILLER, DANIEL L","09/15/2016","06/30/2021","adeno-associated viral vector; Affect; Animal Model; Animals; Area; astrogliosis; Atrophic; Autopsy; Basal Ganglia; Behavior; Behavior assessment; Behavioral; Biological Neural Networks; Brain; Brain region; CAG repeat; Characteristics; Chorea; Clinical; Cognition Disorders; Cognitive; cognitive development; Complex; Corpus striatum structure; DARPP; Data; Data Set; Dendritic Spines; Dependovirus; Deterioration; Development; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Disease; Disease model; disease phenotype; Disease Progression; Dopamine; Dopamine Receptor; Dystonia; Electrophysiology (science); executive function; Exhibits; experience; Fright; frontal lobe; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Funding; Future; gain of function; Ganglia; Gene Transfer; Genes; Genetic Transcription; Gliosis; Globus Pallidus; Glutamate Receptor; Glutamates; Glutamine; Goals; Histological Techniques; Human; Huntington Disease; Huntington gene; Image; image guided; imaging study; Impaired cognition; in vivo; Inclusion Bodies; Injectable; Injection of therapeutic agent; Intervention; K-Series Research Career Programs; Laboratories; Lead; Length; Macaca; Macaca mulatta; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Manuscripts; Mediating; Modeling; Molecular; Molecular Analysis; Monkey Diseases; Monkeys; Morphology; Motor; motor control; Motor Cortex; motor disorder; Motor Skills; Movement Disorders; mutant; Mutation; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke; Nerve Degeneration; Neurobiology; Neurodegenerative Disorders; neuroimaging; neuron loss; Neuronal Dysfunction; Neurons; neuropathology; Neurosciences; neurosurgery; neurotransmission; nonhuman primate; novel; Pathologic; Pathology; Patients; Phenotype; Preparation; Proteins; putamen; Research; Rest; Scientist; Short-Term Memory; Slice; Statistical Data Interpretation; Stretching; Structure; Substantia nigra structure; Techniques; Technology; Testing; Therapeutic Use Study; touchscreen; Transcript; transmission process; vector genome; white matter; ","Cortico-basal ganglia connectivity in a non-human primate model of Huntington's disease","099136","CNN","Clinical Neuroscience and Neurodegeneration Study Section ","","","02","368231","278648","646879",""

Previously, NK cells were considered non-specific in their recognition of pathogens; however, mouse models have shown that some NK cells exhibit adaptive antigen-specific properties. We now show that primate NK cells can also demonstrate antigen-specific memory against HIV and SIV antigens.

Our proposal is highly novel and innovative and, if successfully done, will potentially lead to a paradigm shift of our understanding of Nurr1's functional roles on mDA neurobiology and future therapeutic development of DA- related brain disorders.","8114735; ","KIM, KWANG-SOO ;","SIEBER, BETH-ANNE ","09/01/2014","06/30/2019","Acetone; Address; Adopted; Affect; Agonist; Alpha Cell; Amodiaquine; Astrocytes; base; Behavior; Binding; Bioinformatics; Biological; Brain; Brain Diseases; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell Death; cell type; Cells; Cessation of life; Chloroquine; Crystallization; Data; Development; Disease; Dopamine; dopaminergic neuron; Drug Addiction; embryonic stem cell; Emotions; experimental study; Functional disorder; Funding; Future; Gene Expression; Genes; Genetic Transcription; Health; Human; In Vitro; in vivo; Inflammation; Inflammatory; innovation; insight; Lead; Ligand Binding Domain; Ligands; macrophage; Maintenance; Microglia; Midbrain structure; Modeling; Molecular; Moods; Movement; Multiprotein Complexes; Mus; Neurobiology; neuroinflammation; neuron development; neuronal survival; Neurons; neurotoxic; novel; novel therapeutics; Nuclear Orphan Receptor; Nuclear Receptors; Organ; Orphan; Parkinson Disease; Pathway interactions; Play; Precipitation; protein protein interaction; public health relevance; Rattus; receptor; Regulation; Rewards; Role; Schizophrenia; Signal Transduction; small molecule; Structure-Activity Relationship; System; therapeutic development; therapeutic target; Tissue Extracts; Transactivation; transcription factor; Ultrafiltration; ","Functional Roles of Nurr1 for Midbrain Dopamine Neurons in Health and Disease","084869","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","25","218750","126875","345625",""

This offers both a challenge and a great opportunity. The future development and dissemination of radiological science depends on the availability of scientists who are not only well grounded in their basic science discipline, but also trained in th application of their knowledge to medical and molecular imaging research. However, scientists with thorough interdisciplinary training are not yet common in today's radiological sciences environment. In fact, the need for such individuals forms one of the central motivations of the NIH's Roadmap Initiative.

Genetic factors and abnormal brain systems are commonly theorized to be involved, but little is known about how genes influence the brain?s response to trauma, and how that leads to clinical symptoms. The proposed project aims to better understand this process by exploring the connections between genetic risk, environmental stress (such as combat trauma), neural abnormalities, and trauma-related symptoms.

By comparing the blood levels of hundreds of compounds between the blood of individuals who developed Parkinson disease and the blood of individuals of the same age and sex who remained healthy, we expect to make novel discoveries on the etiology of Parkinson disease and to be able to develop a method for the early identification of Parkinson disease in other populations.","1899271; ","ASCHERIO, ALBERTO ;","SUTHERLAND, MARGARET L","09/01/2015","06/30/2020","acylcarnitine; Affect; Age; aging population; Alanine; American; Archives; base; Biological Markers; Blood; Blood specimen; brain cell; Branched-Chain Amino Acids; Caffeine; cancer prevention; Cancer Prevention Study II; case control; Choline; Chronic; Chronic Disease; cigarette smoking; Clinical; clinical Diagnosis; Coffee; cohort; Cohort Studies; Confounding Factors (Epidemiology); Consumption; Controlled Study; Creatine; Cross-Sectional Studies; Data; Data Collection; design; Diabetes Mellitus; diabetes risk; Diagnosis; Diagnostic; Diet; disability; Disease; Disease Progression; disorder risk; Early Diagnosis; Early identification; Etiology; Event; Failure; follow-up; Follow-Up Studies; Functional disorder; Funding; gender difference; Glutamates; Goals; Health Professional; Incidence; Individual; insight; Institutes; Insulin Resistance; interest; Investigation; Life Style; Machine Learning; Measures; Mediating; Medical; Medical History; men; Metabolic; Metabolic Pathway; metabolic profile; metabolome; metabolomics; Methods; mitochondrial dysfunction; Motor; motor symptom; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke; Nature; Nerve Degeneration; Neurodegenerative Disorders; neuron loss; novel; novel strategies; Nurses' Health Study; nutrition; Parkinson Disease; Participant; Patients; Periodicals; peripheral blood; Persons; Phase; Physical activity; Plasma; Population; pre-clinical; Progressive Disease; prospective; public health relevance; Research; Resources; Risk; Risk Factors; Sampling; sex; Smoking; specific biomarkers; Specificity; Techniques; Therapeutic; Time; tool; United States; United States National Institutes of Health; Update; Urate; Validation; Women's Health Nursing; Work; ","Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease","089619","NAME","Neurological, Aging and Musculoskeletal Epidemiology ","","","03","453332","109747","563079",""

Low-income African American and Latino children are particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of this transition, and the stark race/ethnic disparities in high school graduation rates and educational attainment likely reflect its long- term consequences. Children with better self-regulation in early childhood display better academic and behavioral adjustment in middle school. In this study, we will follow a cohort of 365 low-income African American and Latino children originally enrolled at age 2 and reassessed at age 3, kindergarten, and first grade to conduct additional assessments in 4th through 7th grade to examine the role of self-regulation skills, family-level processes and neighborhood conditions in explaining academic and behavioral adjustment in middle school.","6623885; ","CAUGHY, MARGARET O;","GRIFFIN, JAMES ","07/01/2013","06/30/2022","Academic achievement; Address; Adolescent; African American; Age; analytical method; Assimilations; Behavioral; behavioral outcome; Buffers; Characteristics; Child; Child Rearing; Cognitive; cohort; Color; Communities; Complex; critical period; Data; Data Collection; design; Development; Developmental Process; Discrimination; early adolescence; early childhood; Ecology; educational atmosphere; Elderly; Enrollment; Environment; Equation; ethnic disparity; ethnic identity; ethnic minority population; Ethnic Origin; experience; Exposure to; Face; Failure; Family; Family Process; Family Relationship; first grade; Follow-Up Studies; Graduation Rates; Growth; high school; Home visitation; Individual; Individual Differences; Informal Social Control; innovation; Interview; junior high school; kindergarten; Latino; Life Cycle Stages; Life Stress; Low income; low socioeconomic status; Measures; Mediating; Methods; Middle School Student; Minority; Modeling; Neighborhoods; Nursery Schools; Participant; Pathway interactions; Performance; Phonation; Population; Poverty; Problem behavior; Process; Race; racial and ethnic; Readiness; Risk; Risk Behaviors; Risk Factors; Role; Sampling; Schools; seventh grade; sexual risk taking; skills; social; Social Class; Social Environment; social skills; Socialization; Stress; stressor; Structure; Student Dropouts; Substance abuse problem; success; Surveys; teacher; Telephone; theories; Time; Transact; Youth; ","Self-regulation development and the transition to middle school","075311","PDRP","Psychosocial Development, Risk and Prevention Study Section ","","A1","04","523458","114662","638120",""

While the current thinking considers Kiss1 neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) as GnRH pulse generators through the action of neurokinin B (NKB) and dynorphin, we have recently documented that other tachykinins (neurokinin A, NKA; and substance P, SP) can activate ARC Kiss1 neurons and that NKB and SP can induce LH release in a kisspeptin- independent manner. Therefore, this proposal aims to decipher the role of each tachykinin in the generation of GnRH pulses at the level of the Kiss1 neuron and GnRH neuron. Understanding the mechanisms that govern GnRH pulsatility will increase the number of potential targets to treat reproductive disorders.","10924831; ","NAVARRO, VICTOR MANUEL;","RAVINDRANATH, NEELAKANTA ","07/28/2017","04/30/2022","Achievement; Affect; Agonist; Amenorrhea; Brain; Cells; Complex; Delayed Puberty; Dependovirus; Disease; Dynorphins; Enterobacteria phage P1 Cre recombinase; Estradiol; Etiology; Exhibits; experimental study; Fertility; Financial compensation; Frequencies; Generations; Genes; Genetic; Genetic study; Goals; Gonadal Steroid Hormones; Gonadal structure; Gonadotropin Hormone Releasing Hormone; Hormonal; Hypothalamic structure; Infertility; KISS1 gene; knock-down; Knock-out; Maintenance; Messenger RNA; Methods; Modeling; Molecular; Monkeys; mouse model; Mus; Nature; Neurokinin A; Neurokinin B; Neurons; Ovarian; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pattern; Pharmacology Study; Phenotype; Physiologic pulse; Pituitary Gland; Proteins; Puberty; receptor; Reproduction; reproductive; reproductive function; Rodent; Role; Series; Signal Transduction; small hairpin RNA; Structure of nucleus infundibularis hypothalami; Substance P; TAC1 gene; Tachykinin; Tachykinin Receptor; TACR1 gene; TACR3 gene; Testing; Thinking; Translating; ","Dissecting the Role of Tachykinins in the Generation of GnRH Pulses","090151","ICER","Integrative and Clinical Endocrinology and Reproduction Study Section ","","A1","01","207500","140227","347727",""

Most PEComas are benign and treated with surgery, but an extremely rare subset are malignant with an aggressive clinical course including distant metastases and ultimate death. This subset, Advanced Malignant PEComa, for which there are no approved treatments, has a poor prognosis with median survival estimated at 12-17 months and has a prevalence of less than 200 patients in the US. Recent case studies have shown mTOR pathway activation often through TSC2 mutations or deletion, making advanced malignant PEComas a promising target for mTOR inhibitors. This prospective phase 2 study (IND 125,669, July 13, 2015) will assess the safety and efficacy of the novel mTOR inhibitor ABI-009, a nanoparticle albumin-bound rapamycin (nab-rapamycin), in patients with advanced malignant PEComa.

A component of this complex, ING4, negatively regulates inflammatory signaling pathways, suggesting a role for this complex in HSC response to these signals.

Overall Nearly 2 million children live with HIV infection world-wide and face life-long antiretroviral treatment (ART) to keep the virus suppressed. Interruptions in treatment, perhaps due to poor financial resources, poor access to medical care, or poor adherence, carry a high risk of medical complications due to what is known as ?viral rebound?. Here we will use an animal model of HIV infection to define the origin, kinetics, and predictors of viral rebound in infants and to establish the impact on viral rebound of enhancing anti-viral humoral and T cell response via vaccination in order to guide development of new strategies to achieve pediatric HIV cure.

The common goal of these clinical trials is to cure rare and difficult to treat cancers such as leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma and some non-malignant diseases such as sickle cell anemia and aplastic anemia. The Division of BMT at Stanford has been an outstanding contributor to past CTN clinical trials with 320 patients enrolled on 16 clinical trials and has been an active participant in CTN committees and related activities. The trial proposed in the current application aims to improve upon the risk of chronic GVHD development which is a main complication that limits safe allogeneic transplantation and is a major source of morbidity and mortality following allogeneic HCT. The proposed trial has the potential to significantly improve outcomes for transplant patients across multiple tumor types, and across all transplant conditioning intensities.","8718040; ","LOWSKY, ROBERT ;","DI FRONZO, NANCY L.","09/30/2001","06/30/2024","active comparator; Adult; Advisory Committees; Agammaglobulinaemia tyrosine kinase; Allogenic; Aplastic Anemia; Area; arm; Autologous; B cell repertoire; B-Cell Activation; base; Basic Science; bench to bedside; Blood; Bone Marrow Transplantation; Cell Count; Cells; Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease; Cities; CLIA certified; Clinical; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials; Clinical Trials Network; Collaborations; Comorbidity; Complication; conditioning; Cyclic GMP; Data Aggregation; data management; design; Development; Disease; disorder risk; emt protein-tyrosine kinase; Enrollment; experience; Funding; Future; genetically modified cells; Goals; Graft-Versus-Tumor Induction; Graft-vs-Host Disease; Grant; Hematological Disease; Hematopoietic; hematopoietic cell transplantation; Homologous Transplantation; Immune; Immunoglobulins; Immunotherapy; improved; improved outcome; Incidence; innovation; Institution; Interleukin-2; International; Intervention; Investigation; Isoantibodies; Laboratories; leukemia/lymphoma; Lymphoma; Maintenance; Maintenance Therapy; Malignant Neoplasms; Marrow; Mediating; Medical; member; Mission; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Multicenter Trials; Multiple Myeloma; Nature; NCI Center for Cancer Research; Non-Malignant; novel; novel strategies; older patient; Outcome Measure; Participant; Patient-Focused Outcomes; Patients; Phase; Phase III Clinical Trials; pre-clinical; Pre-Clinical Model; prevent; Prevention; Prevention strategy; primary outcome; Procedures; Program Research Project Grants; programs; prophylactic; Protocols documentation; Randomized; Reaction; reconstitution; Regimen; relapse risk; Research; Research Activity; Research Personnel; Research Support; Residual Neoplasm; Risk; Serum; Sickle Cell Anemia; Source; stem; Steroids; symposium; Testing; Toxic effect; translational clinical trial; Translational Research; Translations; Transplant Recipients; Transplantation; trial comparing; tumor; Umbilical Cord Blood; United States National Institutes of Health; Universities; Work; ","BMT Clinical Trial Network at Stanford","069291","ZHL1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","17","114001","34200","141316",""

Current treatments are based on immunosuppressive medications, which are unspecific and often toxic. As a result, patients can develop recurrent infections due to the generalized state of immunosuppression, which increases the risk of complications and mortality. Our studies will not only provide new insights into lupus etiopathogenesis but also identify new biomarkers for developing more specific therapies with fewer side effects than those of current therapies. Our results may also apply to other autoimmune diseases such as diabetes, in which O-glycosylation also plays an important role.

We propose to develop a therapeutic strategy based on inhibition of CRL4DCAF1 with MLN4924 in these highly malignant tumors.","1880478 (contact); 10552523; ","GIANCOTTI, FILIPPO G (contact); ZAUDERER, MARJORIE G.;","TIMMER, WILLIAM C","01/01/2016","06/30/2021","Agar; base; Binding; Cancer stem cell; CDKN2A gene; Cell Nucleus; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Cells; chemotherapy; Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure; chromatin remodeling; Cisplatin; Clinic; Clinical; clinical efficacy; Clinical Trials; cohort; conformer; Contact Inhibition; Cullin Proteins; Development; DNA Repair; Drug effect disorder; efficacy testing; Enzymes; Exhibits; Extracellular Matrix; flexibility; Gene Expression; Genetically Engineered Mouse; Growth; Image; Immunoblotting; improved; improved outcome; In Vitro; in vivo; inhibitor/antagonist; Injectable; Institution; Ligase; Maintenance; Malignant mesothelioma; Malignant Mesothelioma of Peritoneum; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; Mesothelioma; Messenger RNA; Modeling; Molecular; Monitor; mouse model; Mus; mutant; Mutation; neoplastic cell; Neurofibromatosis 2; Neurofibromin 2; NF2 gene; novel; novel therapeutics; Nuclear; Oncogenic; Organoids; Output; p19ARF; Pathway interactions; Patient-Focused Outcomes; Patients; Pemetrexed; Pharmaceutical Preparations; phase I trial; Phase I/II Trial; phase II trial; Phosphotransferases; Pleural; Pleural cavity; pre-clinical; preclinical efficacy; preclinical study; Preclinical Testing; Proliferating; prospective; Proteins; public health relevance; Regimen; Repression; Safety; Sampling; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Site; small hairpin RNA; small molecule; Subfamily lentivirinae; Tertiary Protein Structure; Testing; Therapeutic; TP53 gene; Transcription Coactivator; Transcriptional Activation; Treatment Efficacy; tumor; tumor growth; Tumor Suppressor Genes; Tumor Suppressor Proteins; Tumor Volume; tumorigenesis; Ubiquitin; Ubiquitin Like Proteins; ubiquitin-protein ligase; Ubiquitination; Xenograft Model; Xenograft procedure; ","Therapeutic efficacy of the CRL inhibitor MLN4924 in NF2 mutant mesothelioma","191222","DT","Developmental Therapeutics Study Section ","","","02","337928","173068","510996",""

In addition, WHO supports the development of research capacity in low income countries and the set-up of research networks between countries and regions. WHO has described its roles and responsibilities in health research in a strategy document, based on a comprehensive consultation process, and endorsed at the 63rd World Health Assembly (WHA) in 2010. It covers the full spectrum of research, which spans five generic areas of activity: measuring the problem; understanding its cause(s); elaborating solutions; translating the solutions or evidence into policy, practice and products; and evaluating the effectiveness of solutions. In addition WHO's position as a focus for global health R&D has recently been reaffirmed in the draft Resolution arising from a Member State meeting held in November 2012. The draft Resolution, which will be debated at the WHA in May 2013, requests the WHO to establish a global health R&D observatory within WHO's Secretariat in order to monitor and analyze relevant information on health R&D with a view to contributing to the identification of gaps and opportunities for health R&D and defining priorities in consultation with Member States. The strategy builds on WHO's core functions, which add value in support of global efforts in health research. WHO's strengths stem from its neutral status and independence, a broadest membership with currently 194 Member States an undisputed experience in international public health, a central role in health-related normative matters, a strong tradition and commitment to evidence based decision-making, its ability to convene and to establish and maintain networks of collaboration, both formal and informal, and an organizational set-up allowing to bridge between a central organization, regions and countries. Against this background and building on the principles of quality, impact and inclusiveness, WHO has defined in its roles and responsibilities in health research five interrelated goals:    * Priorities - this concerns the reinforcement of research (at national, regional and global levels, and within WHO) in response to priority health needs;  * Capacity - this relates to the provision of support to the strengthening of national systems for  * health research;  * Standards - this concerns the promotion of good practice in research, drawing on WHO's core function of setting norms and standards;  * Translation - this involves the strengthening of links between the policy, practice and products of research;  * A fifth objective relates to the research competency within WHO.    Since the 1970s WHO has established and run a number of technical programs with research as their primary focus including the special program on Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction (HRP), and the special program on Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) sponsored jointly with UNESCO, UNDP and the World Bank. Building on this experience, another dedicated research program, the 'Initiative for Vaccine Research' (IVR) was established in 2001 to create a unified entity in support of vaccine and vaccination research. In addition to these dedicated efforts many research activities are embedded into the disease control programs, underlining the policy-relevance and application-orientation of WHO's research work. Significant research activities are conducted in relation to child and adolescent health, HIV, TB, malaria and neglected tropical diseases and increasingly in the areas of health systems and services research, as well as non-communicable diseases (including cancer) and mental health. Based on a 2006/2007 survey (a more recent survey is in preparation), WHO spends 84% of its research expenditure on DALY type I diseases (communicable, maternal, perinatal and nutritional diseases), which represents 40% of the global DALY. 4% is allocated to DALY type II diseases (non-communicable diseases) which represent 48% of global DALY. This apparent imbalance is changing, but also reflects the emphasis of WHO's work on diseases that primarily affect the poor.","12258052; ","TROEDSSON, HANS ;","MEEGAN, JAMES M.","06/15/2013","05/31/2018","Address; adolescent health; Affect; Area; authority; base; Basic Science; Biomedical Research; Child health care; Clinical; Collaborations; Competence; Constitution; Consultations; Country; Decentralization; Decision Making; Development; disability-adjusted life years; Disease; disorder control; Education; Effectiveness; Environment; Epidemic; evidence base; Expenditure; experience; Fostering; Funding; Generations; Generic Drugs; global health; Goals; Government; Health; Health Policy; Health Priorities; Health Services Research; Health system; HIV/TB; Human; innovation; Institutes; Institution; institutional capacity; International; Intervention; Joints; Knowledge; Lead; Link; low and middle-income countries; low income country; Malaria; Malignant Neoplasms; Measures; meetings; member; Mental Health; Monitor; neglected tropical diseases; novel; Nutritional; Perinatal; Policies; Positioning Attribute; Preparation; Process; programs; Psychological reinforcement; Public Health; Public Health Applications Research; public health priorities; Reproduction; Research; Research Activity; research and development; research in practice; Research Infrastructure; Research Training; Resolution; Resources; response; Role; Running; Shapes; stem; Stimulus; Structure; Surveys; systems research; Technology Assessment; Training; Translating; Translations; Tropical Disease; UNESCO; United States National Institutes of Health; Vaccination; Vaccine Research; Vaccines; Work; World Bank; World Health; World Health Organization; ","Enhanced collaboration between US NIH and WHO on biomedical research","108543","ZAI1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","05","569454","74029","318624",""

The Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation has recently estimated that 1,275,000 people are living with paralysis from SCI in the United States alone. This country could save an estimated $400 billion on direct and indirect lifetime costs if we can find ways to treat and prevent SCI. Bladder and sexual dysfunction affects daily life, reduces quality of life and results in numerous life-long health complications. Improvements in bladder and sexual function have been reported in some people with incomplete SCI while they are undergoing a new rehabilitation intervention, Locomotor Training. In addition, four individuals with motor complete SCI who have received epidural stimulation in combination with Locomotor Training have also reported significant improvements in bladder and sexual function. We propose unique experimental human studies to understand whether spinal cord circuits responsible for walking are also important for bladder and sexual functions and reorganize in response to Locomotor Training and/or epidural stimulation after SCI to improve these functions and alter important chemicals in the body. The knowledge gained from our innovative multi-disciplinary study may lead to the translation of non-invasive approaches that will improve bladder and sexual function in people with SCI. Because we study humans with SCI directly, what we learn will be immediately applicable to patients and provide immense improvements in quality of life.","1884506; 6490947 (contact); ","HARKEMA, SUSAN J; HUBSCHER, CHARLES H.

Studies have shown the blood-testis barrier (BTB) to be the primary target of these toxicants, such as cadmium, phthalates and bisphenol A. This project seeks to understand the molecular mechanism(s) of BTB regulation by biologically active peptides released at the apical ectoplasmic specialization (apical ES) and the basement membrane (BM) that regulate BTB dynamics in the apical ES-BTB-BM axis during the epithelial cycle of spermatogenesis. It also investigates the endogenous production of these regulatory peptides in staged tubules under the influence of cytokines, steroids and metalloproteases. These findings will provide a thorough understanding of the biology of the BTB and will provide new insight on the development of therapeutic approaches that protect the testis from harmful toxicants. Furthermore, this project will identify new targets for male contraceptive development. For instance, biologically active peptides can be developed to disrupt BTB function and impair spermatogenesis reversibly.","1886120; ","CHENG, C.

The proposed basic science research is to better understand the underlying mechanisms of mTBI. During the chronic phase of mTBI, decreased brain glucose utilization is consistently observed in preclinical and clinical studies. Glucose and  its intermediate metabolites are essential fuels to maintain neuronal cell function. The decreased supply of glucose in the brain will also lead to memory loss, a common findings in patients with mTBI.

Here we propose to build an innovative framework for genetic architecture inference that    can integrate all available genomic and clinical data, for both discovery genetics and risk prediction.        In Specific Aim 1, we will develop and analyze a model for rare functional DNA sequence variants    in a hierarchical Bayesian framework that will allow formal integration as probabilistic determinants of    causality for disease risk. The model will be developed in concert with application to schizophrenia    discovery genetics, by analyzing whole exome sequence data from case/control and simplex trio    samples and integrating functional genomic data on brain and neuronal specific protein complexes and    interaction, expression quantitative traits and chromatin regulation. These analyses will deliver posterior    probabilities of causality for individual genes and variants, and posterior distributions of effect sizes of    rare risk variants across genes, annotations and exposures.        In Specific Aim 2, we will extend the model to incorporate individual level data including common    GWAS variants and epidemiological variables in the same samples. These analyses will refine rare    variant effect size estimates and promises to provide insights into rare variant mechanisms of action    across implicated genes.        In Specific Aim 3, we will apply the method in two contexts that strongly depend on an accurate rare variant genetic architecture for schizophrenia. First, power analyses of next generation sequencing    studies will be conducted to prioritize future study designs and to determine the sample sizes needed.    Second, genomic risk prediction models will be assessed, with possible implications for risk    stratification in clinical and research contexts.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Schizophrenia is a common, complex psychiatric disorder that affects 1% of the population, over two million people in the United States, and there is no cure.

Recognizing this, recent initiatives in traumatic brain injury (TBI) care have highlighted the complexity of its medical management and recommend that it include an assessment of any co-existing (comorbid) medical disorders. However, there remains a need for an advanced understanding of when the condition(s) occurred (i.e., pre- or post-injury), how the conditions affect the patient with TBI, and which comorbid conditions cause the greatest burden with respect to excessive use of resources in TBI, functional outcomes, and all-cause mortality. The study team, with experience in traumatic brain injury research, rehabilitation science, neuroscience, biostatistics, and large database analysis, proposes a retrospective cohort study of comorbidity in TBI that is population-based, scalable and feasible.

This research seeks to explore the presence of cardiovascular disease in a region where HIV/AIDS is most prevalent, i.e. sub-Saharan Africa, and develop culturally-acceptable and effective programs to reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease on the lives of these patients.","10603335 (contact); 12226673; ","OVBIAGELE, BRUCE  (contact); SARFO, FRED STEPHEN;","MICHELS, KATHLEEN M","09/01/2016","06/30/2018","Adherence; Adoption; Adverse effects; Africa South of the Sahara; Age; AIDS-Related Opportunistic Infections; AIDS/HIV problem; American; Anti-Retroviral Agents; antiretroviral therapy; Atherosclerosis; base; Blood Vessels; burden of illness; Cardiovascular Diseases; cardiovascular disorder risk; Caregivers; Caucasians; CD4 Lymphocyte Count; Cessation of life; Chronic Disease; cohort; Combined Modality Therapy; Communities; Comorbidity; Country; Data; Demographic Factors; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; Diagnosis; Disease Management; Disease Outcome; Dyslipidemias; Effectiveness; Employee Strikes; Epidemic; Evaluation; Event; Exposure to; Focus Groups; Frequencies; Functional disorder; Future; General Population; Ghana; Goals; high risk; HIV; HIV antiretroviral; HIV Infections; Hospital Administrators; Hypertension; immune activation; improved; improved outcome; indexing; Individual; informant; Intervention; Intervention Studies; Interview; intimal medial thickening; intrinsic motivation; Life Style; Longevity; Malignant Neoplasms; Medical; men; Metabolic; Modeling; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Nature; Neoplasms; Opportunistic Infections; Patient Care; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase; Population; Predisposition; Prevalence; Prognostic Factor; programs; Protocols documentation; Provider; Regimen; Research; Research Methodology; Resources; response; Risk; Risk Factors; Risk Management; Risk Reduction; Rural; sedentary lifestyle; Self Efficacy; Self Management; Serological; sex; Smoking; social; Socioeconomic Status; socioeconomics; Surveys; Survival Rate; Testing; United States National Institutes of Health; Urban Hospitals; Vascular Diseases; Viral Load result; Virus; western diet; ","Evaluation of Vascular Event Risk while on Long-term Antiretroviral Suppressive Treatment (EVERLAST)","010479","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","132185","17417","149602",""

We have now formed a consortia with Indiana University (Indianapolis, IN) and the Karmanos Cancer Institute (Detroit, MI). In the current RFA, the BMT CTN Network requests that centers focus on clinical trials for patients with non-malignant diseases (including sickle cell anemia), children, and novel trials that use the immune system to target cancer cells. Our consortia is well positioned to support BMT CTN trials that focus on non-malignant diseases, with a large population of patients (1500+) with sickle cell disease currently being cared for at member sites. Our consortia will be strong in BMT CTN trials that focus on children, with each consortia site affiliated with a large pediatric hospital and pediatric transplant program, including Mott Children's Hospital (University of Michigan), Riley Children's Hospital (Indiana University), and the Children's Hospital of Michigan (Karmanos Cancer Institute). The strength of our consortia is our physician scientists, with Dr. Pavan Reddy (Transplant Immunology/ GVHD), Hal Broxmeyer (Hematopoiesis, Cord Blood Biology), Sophie Paczesny (Biomarkers) all internationally recognized for their bench research. We have an incredibly strong group of clinical / translational scientists with a history of running multicenter and national trials, including Dr. Greg Yanik (Transplant Lung Injury), Sherif Farag (Cord Blood Transplantation) and Joseph Uberti (GVHD). In our Research Proposal, we propose looking at a relatively new concept in bone marrow transplantation, specifically looking at the importance of the ?damage pathway.? The laboratory of Dr. Pavan Reddy has found that chemotherapy can damage tissues, leading to the release of ?damage proteins?. These damage proteins are able to activate the immune system, subsequently leading to graft versus host disease (GVHD) and ultimately more inflammation in the body. Working with an industry partner, Dr. Reddy found a protein called CD24Fc that was able to block the damage proteins and thus decrease the amount of inflammation in subjects. Just as important, he was able to show that the use of CD24Fc did NOT lead to more infections or relapse. We are now proposing a clinical trial that uses CD24Fc in patients undergoing bone marrow transplant. The drug will only be given once, by intravenous infusion one day prior to the transplant. We will examine the ability of CD24Fc to decrease the toxicity of transplant, and specifically the amount of GVHD that patients can develop. If successful, this study would be a novel step forward in understanding the biology of transplant, and limiting its complications.","6564538; 8451458 (contact); ","REDDY, PAVAN ; YANIK, GREGORY A (contact);","DI FRONZO, NANCY L.","09/30/2001","06/30/2024","Acute Graft Versus Host Disease; Address; Allogenic; Antigen-Presenting Cells; antimicrobial; Attenuated; base; Binding; biobank; Biological Markers; Biology; Blood; Bone Marrow Transplantation; cancer cell; Caring; CCR5 gene; Cessation of life; chemotherapy; Child; Childhood; Clinical; Clinical Trials; conditioning; Correlative Study; cytokine; Disease; Donor person; Event; Foundations; Geography; Graft-Versus-Tumor Induction; Graft-vs-Host Disease; Half-Life; Hematopoiesis; Immune; Immune system; Immunoglobulins; Immunologics; Immunology; improved; Incidence; Indiana; industry partner; Infection; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Inflammatory Response; Injury; insight; Institutes; International; Intravenous infusion procedures; Laboratories; Lead; Lectin; lung injury; Lung Transplantation; Malignant Neoplasms; Marrow; MCAM gene; Measures; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; member; Michigan; Molecular; mortality; Multicenter Studies; Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1; Non-Malignant; novel; Organ; pathogen; Pathway interactions; patient population; patient stratification; Patients; Pattern; Pediatric Hospitals; Persons; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase; Physicians; Pilot Projects; placebo controlled study; Plasma; Play; Positioning Attribute; pre-clinical; prevent; Prevention; programs; Prophylactic treatment; Proteins; Proteomics; Randomized; randomized placebo controlled trial; Recording of previous events; Regimen; Relapse; Research; Research Proposals; Resistance development; response; Risk; Running; Scientific Advances and Accomplishments; Scientist; Severities; Severity of illness; sialic acid binding Ig-like lectin; Sialic Acids; Sickle Cell; Sickle Cell Anemia; Signal Transduction; Site; stem; success; T-Lymphocyte; Testing; therapy development; Tissues; Toxic effect; Translating; translational scientist; Transplant Recipients; Transplantation; Transplanted tissue; Umbilical Cord Blood; Umbilical Cord Blood Transplantation; Universities; Work; ","University of Michigan Core Clinical Center for the BMT Research Network","069330","ZHL1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","17","114001","57475","170133",""

I propose to investigate the mechanism by which this region promotes infection in neurons, and determine if this function in conserved in the human neuroinvasive alphaherpesvirus, herpes simplex virus (HSV-1).","11990262; ","RICHARDS, ALEXSIA L;","NATARAJAN, RAMYA ","12/01/2016","05/31/2017","Address; Advanced Development; Afferent Neurons; Affinity; Antiviral Agents; Attenuated; Attenuated Live Virus Vaccine; Axon; Axonal Transport; base; Blindness; Brain; Capsid; Cell Line; Cell Nucleus; Cells; Codon Nucleotides; Complex; Cornea; Data; Defect; Dependence; Developed Countries; Development; dynactin; Dynein ATPase; Encephalitis; Epithelial Cells; Exhibits; experience; experimental study; Eye; follow-up; Generations; Herpesviridae; Herpesvirus 1; High Prevalence; Human; Immune response; Immunocompetent; in vivo; Infection; Infection prevention; Invaded; Kinetics; Knowledge; latent infection; Life; mad itch virus; member; Microtubules; Modeling; Molecular; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Mothers; Motion; Motor; Mus; Mutagenesis; mutant; Mutate; Mutation; Nature; Nervous system structure; Neuraxis; neuronal cell body; Neurons; Newborn Infant; pathogen; Peripheral; Peripheral Nervous System; Phenotype; Plant Resins; Play; Population; post-doctoral training; prevent; Property; Protein Isoforms; Proteins; public health relevance; Rattus; relating to nervous system; Research; Resources; retrograde transport; Rodent; Role; Sensory; Sepharose; Simplexvirus; Surface; Testing; trait; transmission process; Trigeminal Nuclei; Tropism; Universities; Varicellovirus; Viral; Viral Genome; Virion; Virulence; Virulence Factors; Virulent; Virus; ","A surface-exposed region of the UL37 protein that is essential for alphaherpesvirus neuroinvasion","116044","","","","S1","02","1200","","1200",""
