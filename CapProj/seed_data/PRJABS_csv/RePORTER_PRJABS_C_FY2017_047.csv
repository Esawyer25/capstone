"9344606","Project Summary The mission of the Washington University Center for Diabetes Translation Research (WU-CDTR) is to eliminate disparities in diabetes by translating, disseminating, implementing, and sustaining evidence-based research findings into real-world settings. The WU-CDTR is located at an outstanding institution that continues as the intellectual home to an exceptional group of investigators conducting rigorous translational research focused around two interacting scientific themes: (1) the root causes of diabetes disparities, and (2) the prevention of obesity as a major contributing cause of Type 2 diabetes. The WU-CDTR has evolved to become a ?network of networks?, with investigators affiliated through a regional resource core with the University of Missouri at Columbia, and two health disparity population cores with the National Congress of American Indians, and the African American Collaborative Obesity Research Network. The WU-CDTR fosters transdisciplinary collaborations, catalyzes new ideas, and supports investigators through six research cores led by national experts in their respective fields that provide distinctive but complementary scientific expertise to inform research with populations at risk for disparities, including: (1) the Dissemination and Implementation in Diabetes Research Core, which advances the study of dissemination and implementation science in diabetes research; (2) the Policy and Systems Science Analysis in Diabetes Research Core, which advances the study of policy- and system-level interventions in diabetes research; (3) the Health Communication and Health Literacy Core, which advances the study of health communication science to test strategies for addressing health disparities in diabetes research; (4) the Health Informatics in Diabetes Research Core, which advances the development and application of healthcare informatics in translational diabetes research; (5) the Research Partnerships with American Indian/Alaska Native Communities Core, which increases the capacity of researchers to engage in translational research with American Indian and Alaska Native communities; and (6) the Solutions to Diabetes in Black Americans Core, which provides methodological and content expertise to support research with the Black population. The WU-CDTR supports a vibrant Pilot and Feasibility Program designed to attract and retain new investigators as well as established investigators new to the field; and it also supports an Enrichment Program that promotes transdisciplinary research, learning opportunities, and mentorship for young investigators. Evidence that the WU-CDTR has been successful in pursuing the mission includes a record of outstanding productivity reflected by publications and funding in diabetes and related research. Success is also measured by the growth of our research base of established and new diabetes investigators, and underrepresented racial minority investigators. The WU-CDTR is positioned as the nexus for transdisciplinary team science and transformative diabetes research addressing multiple dimensions of diabetes disparities."
"9315615","The UC Davis MIND Institute IDDRC Rodent Behavior Core (RBC) is fundamental to Center projects seeking  to understand the biological mechanisms underlying IDD and to pursue translational discovery of therapeutics.  This is a completely new core that builds on existing and newly available resources and expertise at the MIND  Institute and UC Davis. Its goal is to meet the high demand for behavioral testing of rodent models of IDD at  UC Davis. The RBC will assist investigators with IDDRC projects in generating high-quality behavioral data for  publication, preclinical discoveries to inform human clinical trials, and pilot data for new studies. Further, the  availability of the services of the RBC is likely to encourage additional UC Davis researchers to become  interested in entering the IDD research field and becoming members of the IDDRC, and we will support this  interest through active outreach efforts.  Comprehensive behavioral assays relevant to IDD, including those developed by Drs. Crawley and  Berman, are employed worldwide to understand causal mechanisms and develop effective therapeutics. The  proposed RBC will employ standardized and innovative behavioral assays relevant to the behavioral symptoms  of IDD. Services will include (a) access to modern, efficient, start-of-the-art behavioral testing facilities; (b)  training for investigators and their staff in behavioral assay procedures and the use of behavioral testing  equipment; (c) hands-on supervision in all aspects of behavioral testing and equipment use; (d) consultation on  experimental design and interpretation of results; (e) assistance in developing new assays required by users;  (f) training and supervision in drug administration for behavioral pharmacology studies; (g) access to facilities  for harvesting tissue from behaviorally tested mice and rats; (h) access to mutant mouse and rat models; (i)  guidance to access related resources at UC Davis, including core facilities for genetics and for generating new  lines of mutant mice; and (j) facilitation of collaborations between IDDRC investigators. Services will further  include (k) consultation for preparing lACUC protocols, grant applications, and manuscripts. In addition, the  core will offer (I) direct behavioral testing services conducted by core staff.  Expertise of the core director, co-director, and managers includes extensive knowledge and experience in  animal models of IDD conditions, behavioral phenotyping of mice with targeted gene mutations, behavioral  phenotyping of inbred strains of mice and rats, and behavioral responses to drug treatments, immune  challenges, and environmental toxins in mice and rats. Mouse facilities are located at the UC Davis School of  Medicine campus in Sacramento. Rat facilities are located at the nearby main campus in Davis. A high level of  scientific and practical interactions is already in place between the two sites. Five tiers of service usage will be  offered: (1) consultation; (2) unsupervised use of equipment available in the core facilities; (3) training and  supervision in conducting behavioral tests using core equipment; (4) battery of assays conducted by core staff;  and (5) tailored sets of assays conducted by core staff. Combinations of services will be designed to match the  needs of each user."
"9358310","SUMMARY The overall goal of Project 1 is to induce tolerance of porcine kidneys in baboons by co-transplantation (Tx) of vascularized thymus. To date, we have induced donor-specific T cell unresponsiveness and prevented anti- donor elicited antibodies, but have not yet achieved long-term, immunosuppression-free survival of xenograft kidneys. During the previous project period, we identified two major obstacles to this goal and developed strategies to overcome them. These are: (i) early loss of xeno-thymokidneys (TKs) due to activation of latent porcine CMV (pCMV); long-term graft survival was restored by elimination of pCMV through cesarean section of donors; and (ii) development of severe proteinuria; this problem could be delayed (but not prevented) by preventing SMPDL- 3b-dependent disruption of pig podocytes through treatment with Rituximab in the peri-Tx period. We also demonstrated upregulation of porcine CD80 on podocytes to be associated with xenograft nephropathy. Our preliminary data demonstrated that a combination therapy of Rituximab, which binds to porcine podocyte SMPDL- 3b and Belatacept, which inhibits CD80 activation, greatly minimized development of proteinuria and markedly prolonged survival (90, 93 and >155 days), with in vitro donor-specific unresponsiveness. The latest animal (now >155 days) developed new emigrant T cells from the porcine thymic graft. Based upon the data developed by this team (Projects 2, 3, and 4), we have designed innovative strategies that aim to completely eliminate proteinuria and permit total discontinuation of immunosuppression. In Aim 1, we will first study the mechanism responsible for persistent proteinuria in order to develop an appropriate strategy to eliminate it. On the basis of our preliminary data, we hypothesize that in addition to a SMPDL-3b pathway, CD47 and SIRP-alpha incompatibility between species may promote innate immune activation that culminates in podocyte activation, which causes upregulation of CD80 on podocytes in TKs. We will study mechanisms of podocyte destruction in vitro and optimize the current therapy in vivo, using hCD47 transgenic GalT-KO pig TK donors. In Aim 2, we will continue our efforts to achieve xenograft tolerance, attempting to improve the immune status of recipients by reconstitution of host- and donor-restricted protective T cell immunity. Studies in Project 3 demonstrated limitations in human T cell function and homeostasis following development in a pig thymus. We will address the hypothesis that these abnormalities will be corrected by adding recipient thymic epithelial cells (TECs) to the porcine thymus graft. We have recently succeeded in preparing hybrid thymic porcine grafts in which NHP TECs engrafted. We will assess the impact of using these hybrid thymi on immune function in baboons. In Aim 3, we will combine this strategy with durable mixed chimerism developed in Project 2. The combination of hybrid thymic grafting and durable mixed chimerism should induce tolerance of both innate and adaptive immune responses, including NK and B cells. The combined approach will also optimize functions of T cells, providing protective immunity against infections of both the recipient and the donor graft and of Tregs that protect both against residual donor-reactive T cells and against autoimmunity."
"9296174","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by social impairments, including impaired social cognition,  social percepfion, and social attention. Recently, there has been increased interest in examining the impact of  motivational systems on social functioning in ASD. The frarinework of the so-called social motivation  hypothesis of ASD is that functional disruption in brain circuits that support social motivational may constitute  a primary deficit in ASD that may have downstream effects on the development of social cognition. The  mesolimbic dopamine system arising in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and projecfing to the nucleus  accumbens (NAc) is an essential substrate for the expression of many forms of motivated behaviors. Human  neuroimaging studies have demonstrated reduced mesolimbic activation in ASD to social rewards, suggesting  that reduced function of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system may underlie decreased sociial motivation in  ASD. Whereas social deficits in ASD may be related to pathological mesolimbic dopamine system activity, it is  unknown if precise neural circuit manipulations that can directly control dopamine output in the NAc to promote  pro-social behaviors in animal models of ASD. In addition, the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) is a promising  therapeufic to promote social engagement in ASD and is known to regulate VTA activity in response to social  rewards specifically. However the functional neural circuitry by which OT neurons regulate VTA  dopaminergic activity has not been identified. These are critical gaps in our understanding of the neural  cii-cuitry that controls motivated social engagement. We propose a translational project integrating optogenetic  circuit manipulafions in a mouse model of ASD with a clinical functional neuroimaging evaluation of the effects  of OT on reward circuits in individuals with ASD."
"9490509","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation has become a standard of care for the treatment of otherwise incurable blood cancers and genetic diseases. The cure of HIV by transplanting CCR5-mutant (CCR5-delta32) HSCs demonstrated the feasibility and power of stem cell-based therapies for eliminating latent virus and controlling AIDS. However, it will be critical to define the spectrum of anti-viral protection, the engraftment threshold of CCR5-mutant HSCs required for protection, and the potential for depletion of the virus reservoir through allo-effect following allogeneic HSC transplantation, to facilitate translation to human patients. We propose to develop an MHC-defined CCR5-mutant nonhuman primate (NHP) bone marrow transplantation model at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center (WNPRC) to address the critical questions of HSC-based therapies for HIV. This model will employ Mauritian Cynomolgus monkeys (MCMs) with well-defined MHC to control genetic factors in the setting of allogeneic bone marrow transplant. In aim 1, we will use CRISPR/Cas9 methods in MCM induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines to optimize efficient targeting of the MCM CCR5-locus with minimal off-target effects. In aim 2, we will confirm the feasibility and accuracy of CCR5 genomic editing in IVF-derived MCM embryos and generate CCR5-mutant MCMs. In aim 3, we will evaluate the engraftment of WT and CCR5-mutant HSCs in SHIV-infected, MHC and blood group identical MCM recipients using a myeloablative BMT regimen and assess the effect of these transplants on persistence of SHIV infection. The proposed studies will establish a CCR5-mutant MHC- defined NHP model and will demonstrate utility for evaluation of HSC-based therapies for AIDS. Development of these resources will benefit AIDS researchers at multiple NIH institutions, including ORIP, NHLBI, NIAID, NIDKK, NICHD, and NINDS. Although CCR5-mutant mutation protects from HIV infection, the lack of CCR5 is also associated with increased susceptibility to West Nile virus infection, and other infections including Toxoplasma gondii, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Chlamydia trachomatis, Listeria, and Plasmodium. Thus, for example, access to CCR5-mutant NHPs will open unique opportunities to establish NHP models for West Nile infection for evaluation of vaccine efficacy and advance the use of NHPs for studies of other infections which may require CCR5-mutant hosts to reproduce a disease course observed in susceptible humans. In addition, advances in gene editing technologies in NHP models will facilitate their clinical translation for treatment of genetic disorders in humans."
"9358705","The effects of drinking alcohol within recommended limits on risks of CVD, diabetes, and related diseases are perhaps the most important questions yet to be answered in the fields of alcohol, nutrition, or prevention. Approximately half of all adults worldwide report current or former alcohol consumption, and the benefits or risks that alcohol poses to their health urgently need clarification. Epidemiological studies have consistently found that alcohol intake within recommended limits is associated with lower risk of coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and diabetes, yet no long-term randomized trial of alcohol consumption on risk of any chronic disease has yet been performed. In direct response to PAR-16-363 (Multi-Site Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial Research Center on Alcohol's Health Effects), we propose together with several other research groups to perform a worldwide, six-year, balanced-design randomized trial, comparing the effects of one standard serving (~14 grams) of alcohol intake daily to abstention on risk of CVD, diabetes, mortality, and related outcomes among 7,800 adults at above-average cardiovascular risk worldwide. To maximize feasibility and reflect actual use most closely, we propose to test alcohol consumption per se to abstention and thus to offer participants flexibility in their choice of beverage, while employing novel and intensive yet efficient methods to monitor safety. The Primary Specific Aim of this trial is to determine the effects of 14 gm of alcohol intake daily compared with abstention on risk of major cardiovascular events or death (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hospitalized angina, need for revascularization, or death) over an average of 6 years of follow-up among 7,800 adults aged ?50 years with estimated 10-year CVD risk ?15% or prevalent CVD >6 months prior to enrollment. Secondary Aims will test the effects of alcohol on risks of incident diabetes and major cardiovascular events. Tertiary Aims will test risks of hard cardiovascular events and progression to impaired fasting glucose. Similar to other large randomized trials, we will establish ~16 centers worldwide using a stepped approach, with a 9-month vanguard phase among 7 centers in the US, Europe, Africa, and South America (in this application), followed by a second wave of additional sites to complete enrollment. Participants will be monitored for safety in multiple complementary ways, including brief electronic real-time reporting and validated yearly instruments and laboratory measures. These centers bring together highly successful groups in the US and Europe to establish clinical, data, and biospecimen coordinating centers, our field centers include many of the most experienced clinical trialists anywhere, and our group has strong working relationships with NIAAA and other NIH staff necessary to ensure seamless collaboration during a U10-funded cooperative research endeavor. In this application, we propose the first randomized clinical trial of alcohol consumption, aiming to determine whether it increases or decreases the risk of CVD and diabetes among adults at above-average cardiovascular risk worldwide."

"9406406","The goal of this proposal is to establish a Cre/loxP rat resource for conditional and physiologically predictive rat models of human diseases. The laboratory rat (R. norvegicus) is a central experimental animal in several fields of biomedical research, such as cardiovascular diseases, aging, infectious diseases, autoimmunity, cancer models, transplantation biology, inflammation, cancer risk assessment, industrial toxicology, pharmacology, behavioral and addiction studies, and neurobiology.  Up till recently, the ability of creating genetically modified rats has been limited compared to that in the mouse mainly due to lack of genetic manipulation tools and technologies in the rat. Recent advances in nucleases, such as CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly-interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR associated protein 9), have been successfully used to construct ?knockout? rat models by injecting gene targeting molecular complexes directly into an embryo for offspring production, avoiding the need to use any type of stem cells. However, CRISPR of its current state works inefficiently for gene knockin in mice or rats, limiting its application in generating site-specific transgenic rat models. Zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) has been successfully used to generate Cre knockin rat models; but it requires expertise in ZFN design and validation, and is also costly.  With a phase I SBIR award (grant # 1R43GM108071-01A1), we successfully developed the rat TARGATTTM system that enables fast, efficient and site-specific introduction of exogenous genetic elements into the rat genome. We generated rat models with a ?docking site?, attP, inserted specifically at a transcriptionally active, safe genomic locus named rH11. Using the bacteriophage integrase technology (trademarked as ?TARGATTTM?), these attP-containing rats can be used as embryo donors for pronuclear microinjection to insert any gene of interest at the attP site. Integrases such as phiC31 or Bxb1 carries out efficient, unidirectional recombination between two non-identical sites, attP and attB. Upon microinjection of an attB-transgene plasmid, together with integrase, recombination between attP and attB results in an insertion of the transgene precisely at the attP site in the rat genome. This TARGATTTM technology allows a fast, efficient generation of knockin rat models containing any gene of interest with consistent, stable, and guaranteed gene expression.  The current Phase II proposal builds logically on the result of our Phase I study and aims to use the TARGATTTM technology to build a collection of site-specific transgenic rats as tool models. More specifically, we aim to generate Cre driver rat models that will allow controlled gene expression or knockout (conditional models) both temporally and spatially through the Cre/loxP system. Hundreds of Cre driver mouse models and over 100 Cre mice distributed by the Jackson Laboratory alone have proven to be crucial in building physiologically predicative mouse models of human diseases. In comparison, there are less than a dozen of Cre rat models reported, indicating an urgent need in establishing multiple Cre rat lines to ensure desired rat models can be generated. We propose to generate, as a starting point, a total of 20 Cre rat lines and one Cre reporter/test line in this study, including eighteen Cre lines on neural specific and two lines on cardiovascular specific Cre expression. Advantages of using our TARGATTTM integrase technology are: (1) Transgene integration happens at a pre-selected and transcriptionally active locus to ensure that Cre is expressed; (2) Site-specific knockin rat models are made by direct injection of DNA, mRNA, or protein into the rat zygotes, bypassing rat ES cells; (3) Gene integration efficiency is higher than CRISPR and cost is lower than ZFN. Successful execution of this project will create a novel and much needed resource for the bio-medical community who employ rat models for their studies of human diseases. Our long-term goal is to further expand the resource to include more Cre rats and rats with loxP-flanked (floxed) alleles for conditional rat model generation. ! !"
"9302437","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Nineteen neuroscientists within Harvard's Neuroscience Program request continued funding for four pre-doctoral positions in our Training Program in Visual Neuroscience. Training focuses on the study of visual pathways from retina to brain, and of the cellular, molecular and developmental neurobiology of the visual system. These faculty members are distributed throughout the university. Ten faculty members are in basic science departments at the Medical School, six are in hospital-based laboratories, and three are in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Over the past two decades, Harvard University has greatly expanded the number faculty members who study the molecular, developmental, and neural-systems approaches to visual science. Students can choose laboratories among a large community of vision researchers, most of who are affiliated with Harvard's NEI Core Grant in Vision research. The goal of the Visual Neuroscience Training Program is to build a large, coherent group of students based in this Harvard-wide vision community, who are trained by its faculty and who have a strong sense of community. The grant will support two students in their second year and two in their third, but students remain actively involved with the program as they advance to later years, creating a large cohort of affiliated students. We train and supervise these students with courses, thesis committees, seminars, symposia, and our Systems-Vision journal club. Thus, trainees interact with the faculty and with each other throughout their graduate careers. Many vision scientists visit Harvard every year to give seminars; trainees at all levels interact with them over lunch and in lab visits. Through these activities, we will help train a new generation of vision scientists whose scientific careers will help us understand all aspects of the visual system: development, information processing, and disease."
"9326023","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a fundamental gap in understanding how patients with chronic disease use social media to seek, find, appraise, and interact with health information to make health decisions. No instrument currently exists to measure interactive eHealth literacy (i.e., patient ability to use social media for health-related decision-making) in patients living with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), the 3rd leading cause of death in the United States (U.S.) that affects over 1.2 million Floridians. Continued existence of this gap represents an important public health problem for patients living with COPD, because, until it is filled, pulmonary rehabilitation specialists, primary care providers, and public health  researchers will be unable to identify the degree to which patients have the ability to use social media for patient education and self-management support. My long-term career goal is to become a leading public health scientist specializing in the study of translational health communication research that explores the effectiveness of interactive eHealth technologies in chronic disease self-management support interventions. The objective of this particular NRSA F31 application is to gain training and mentored research experience that will help me develop and field test an instrument with sufficient measurement properties to measure both self-efficacy and task performance related to interactive eHealth literacy in COPD. The objective of this research will be accomplished by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Develop a novel web-based instrument to measure interactive eHealth literacy among adults living with COPD; and 2) Administer one pilot (n=50) and one field test (n=555) of the novel instrument to measure interactive eHealth literacy in a random sample of Floridians living with COPD. This approach is innovative, because, for the first time, interactive eHealth literacy will be assessed among patients with COPD. To develop this new web-based instrument, I will complete a comprehensive series of sponsor-directed tutorials, doctoral-level courses, workshops, and research seminars that will provide me with training in: (a) consumer health informatics and human-technology interaction, (b) community-engaged research (CEnR) methods for patient recruitment in medically underserved communities; and (c) advanced measurement and psychometric testing. The rationale for this multidisciplinary training plan is to collect preliminry data for an NRSA F32 application that will examine associations between interactive eHealth literacy, functional, and clinical health outcomes among adults living with COPD. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to be the first step in a continuum of research tha will lead to identifying adults with COPD who are prepared to use interactive web-based patient education and self-management support tools to improve their health-related quality of life. Ultimately, the skills gained during this NRSA F31 fellowship will allow me to develop an independent line of research exploring the effects of interactive eHealth literacy on a variety of patient-centered health outcomes in COPD."
"9368740","Project Summary Tyrosine phosphorylation can regulate protein function, and this is a cornerstone of cell signaling networks. Ty- rosine phosphorylation often becomes dysregulated in cancer and therefore, understanding the effect of phos- phorylation on protein function will be paramount to identifying therapeutic interventions in cancer. Unfortunately, an important tool in the basic research of phosphorylation ? testing the effect of protein phosphorylation by com- paring the function of the phosphorylated form with an unphosphorylated form of the protein in in vitro assays ? is signi?cantly hindered by our limited knowledge in how to make a phosphorylated protein. This project seeks to build a molecular technology, inspired by previous observations of biochemistry in cell networks, to overcome this requirement and improve the pace of basic research. The goal of this research is to build a fast, accessible and inexpensive method for producing phosphorylated and soluble proteins in a bacterial system. The goals will be achieved by: development of a molecular toolkit for the enhancement and control of precise phosphorylation on protein substrates using secondary kinase-substrate targeting approaches, testing the toolkit on a set of sub- strates, and comparing the outcome with current technologies. It is anticipated that this technology will be less expensive, more physiologically-relevant, and capable of producing a larger variety of phosphorylated forms of proteins than current molecular approaches to studying the effect of protein phosphorylation."
"9401815","Ionizing radiation (IR) causes damage to living organisms. The health effects of IR for different total doses and dose rates at which IR was delivered have to be defined by statistical analyses based on whole organism endpoints such as an increase in the risk for development of cancer or an increased risk of life shortening. The factor by which a total dose could be increased, if protracted, for the same final biological effect, is known as dose and dose-rate effectiveness factor (DDREF). The cumulative protracted radiation received by the entire population of USA is very large and falls under regulatory policies that are government defined. These policies rely on the work of national and international agencies evaluating potential dangers of IR using the DDREF value as one of the key input factors for consideration of protracted IR exposures. Ultimately, government regulated limits for occupational and public IR exposures (mostly protracted) and recommendations for X-ray based medical diagnostic procedures (mostly low total doses) all depend on currently accepted DDREF value. Using computational tools and animal data on acute and protracted exposures we found that the DDREF estimate used at this time is inappropriate (Haley et al. 2015) but that dose-rate effectiveness factor (DREF) can be evaluated using extensive animal data. In this project we propose to use interspecies comparisons to refine (1) external beam DREF values and (2) radionuclide dose/quality/route of administration dose rate effectiveness factors (DREF) for specific types of radiation induced cancers (and life shortening from internal emitters). This is especially important in light of the fact that several international bodies are looking to change values for DDREF? a letter from ICRP sent specifically to our group supporting the importance of this work is attached to the application."
"9537919","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Staphylococcus aureus is the leading cause of a wide variety of deadly infections. The success of this pathogen is due to a number of factors, including its ability to grow as a biofilm, genetic resistance to multiple antibiotics, its diverseand highly-adaptable metabolism, and its impressive array of resistance mechanisms towards oxidative and nitrosative stress. Bacterial nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enzymes produce nitric oxide (NO) and have been implicated in resistance to exogenous oxidative stress and antibiotics in several bacteria, including S. aureus. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are also produced naturally when bacteria undergo aerobic respiration, and we have observed increased endogenous ROS in a S. aureus nos mutant grown under aerobic respiration-promoting conditions. S. aureus NOS (saNOS) has previously been shown to protect against oxidative stress, antibiotics, and leukocyte-killing, and promotes survival in both murine abscess and sepsis models of infection. However, there still remain many central unanswered questions about this enzyme, including the potential function of NOS in bacterial physiology and endogenous stress resistance, as well as the mechanisms that govern nos gene expression and NOS enzyme activity. Our nos mutant also displays increased membrane potential, suggesting that saNOS regulates S. aureus metabolism by an as-yet unknown mechanism. Corresponding transcriptomic profiling from this growth condition also suggests that the nos mutant switches its gene expression from aerobic respiration to anaerobic respiration/fermentation pathways. These results collectively suggest that saNOS functions in S. aureus physiology to modulate respiration and endogenous oxidative stress. This hypothesis will be tested by dissecting the contribution of saNOS to metabolism (Aim 1) through the use of EPR to measure NO-cytochrome interactions, as well as assessing environmental (ROS, NO) and genetic (SrrAB) signals for their role in promoting the gene expression changes observed in the nos mutant. The response of nos gene expression to environmental cues that result in perturbations of the cell membrane, as well as to the two-component systems (TCS) LytSR, GraRS, and SrrAB will be assessed using a variety of genetic approaches (Aim 2). Finally, saNOS cellular reductase partner(s) will be identified by in vivo pull-down assays as well as screening of a transposon mutant library, followed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis of purified saNOS and potential interacting proteins to verify specific binding and association/dissociation kinetics (Ai 3). It is expected that this research will enlighten our understanding of the role of saNOS in regulating metabolism and endogenous oxidative stress resistance, mechanisms that contribute to the ability of S. aureus to adapt to different growth environments in vivo. In turn, this will ad in the development of novel treatment strategies against this formidable pathogen."
"9331048","Anti-HIV or HIV-HCV/HBV co-infection drugs help people with HIV/AIDS live longer and healthier lives. However, the HIV medicines often cause side effects. Although most side effects from the HIV medicines are manageable, a few such as damages to the liver can be very serious and life threatening. To be worse, nearly half of the HIV infected patients abuse/consume alcohol or having a multiple drug-abuse problem, which not only impairs patients? adherence to the anti-HIV therapy but also deteriorates antiviral-induced hepatotoxicity leading to greater morbidity and mortality. Hence molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets underlying the hepatotoxicity are under intense investigations. Previous studies by us and others suggest that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress contributes to HIV protease inhibitors and/or alcohol abuse-induced hepatic cell death, steatohepatitis and cirrhosis in animal models and patients. However, therapies to ensure proper ER homeostasis such as applications of chemical chaperones, antioxidants, autophagy inducers, or selective enhancement of protective ER signaling pathways only yield partial effects in a variety of in vitro and in vivo model systems, which suggest that other more precise cellular targets are involved in the anti-HIV drugs and/or alcohol-induced hepatotoxicity. Our most recent studies reveal a strong effect of certain HIV protease inhibitors on the ER-Golgi trafficking and integrity of the Golgi apparatus, which occurs earlier than the ER stress response and results in increased cell death compared to the cell death induced by pharmaceutical ER stress inducing agents. Herein we hypothesize that the anti-HIV drugs target primarily at the Golgi apparatus and dysfunction of Golgi triggers other organelle stress response leading to liver disease development, which is deteriorated by alcohol-induced ER stress response. We propose to: (1) identify specific molecular components of the ER-Golgi traffic machineries that are affected by the anti-HIV drugs and/or alcohol; (2) investigate mechanisms that regulate the drug-induced Golgi stress response; (3) study how the Golgi stress mediates downstream hepatic injury; (4) evaluate cytoprotective effects of therapies targeting the Golgi stress. This project will provide a scientific basis for a better care for HIV/AIDS patients suffering from liver damages resulted from anti-HIV drugs and alcohol abuse."
"9326977","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research contributes to Tobacco Regulatory Science by connecting (1) tobacco marketing features with (2) consumer affective, cognitive and physiological response to marketing images and (3) tobacco product perceptions and use outcomes in ethnically diverse populations (African American, Asian American, Latino and non-Hispanic white). By identifying key features of tobacco marketing (e.g. colors, descriptors, branding, marketing claims) that optimize consumer response to the marketing and ultimately connecting that to tobacco use outcomes over time, this project adds to the evidence base used to regulate tobacco marketing. This project will provide a comprehensive description of the tobacco marketing landscape and an inventory of 'high impact' tobacco marketing features that produce inequitable outcomes in tobacco use. Additionally, by examining consumers' affective, cognitive and physiologic response to ads, this project will illuminate the underlying mechanisms through which these marketing features operate. The aims of this project are to: (1) describe key features of tobacco marketing targeted towards (a) African Americans, (b) Asian Americans, (c) Latinos (including Mexican Americans, Cubans and Puerto Ricans) and (d) non-Hispanic whites; (2) identify how marketing features impact response to ads for Latinos and Latino subgroups; and (3) for each ethnic group, demonstrate how tobacco product use is initiated and changes as a result of awareness of advertising and having a favorite ad and identify marketing features associated with tobacco product use. To accomplish these aims, the proposed research leverages the infrastructures of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) study and the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL), linking ad-level data from a PATH ad-hoc study that content codes tobacco marketing images with longitudinal PATH data and conducting an ancillary study to the HCHS/SOL assessing self-report and physiological response to tobacco ads.

"9519508","PROJECT SUMMARY Critical knowledge gaps in our understanding of stem cells and their epigenetic control mechanisms are roadblocks to clinical translation of stem cell-related technologies. Advances in our understanding of these processes will have substantial impact on human health by catalyzing innovative disease treatments and development of regenerative medicine therapies. Our long-term goal is to accelerate the development of innovative stem cell-related treatments by determining the epigenetic mechanisms of stem cell functions, including cellular plasticity. The focused objective here, which is the next step towards that goal, is to elucidate the roles of histone variant H3.3 in regulating plasticity in stem cells and to modulate its functions. Our central hypothesis is that H3.3 acts as a novel, targetable epigenetic switch: in a naïve stem cell state H3.3 confers plasticity, but it can toggle to promote differentiation in response to specific signals. The rationale for the proposed studies is that once H3.3 epigenetic switch functions are defined and models of switch modulation are created, our work will have high translational impact by catalyzing new approaches to treat infertility, birth defects, and cancer. Our multidisciplinary team of stem cell researchers will test our hypothesis via three Specific Aims. The first aim focuses on mechanisms of H3.3 regulation of induced plasticity during cellular reprogramming to make induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSC). The second aim will determine mechanisms of maintained plasticity by H3.3 in ESCs. The third aim interrogates and modulates H3.3 function in differentiation and differentiated cells. In each aim H3.3 and switch components will be modulated genetically via coordinated, synergistic interventions including novel H3.3 knockout mice and next generation CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in human cells. The proposed research is significant because the knowledge gained here and the creation of model systems of H3.3 switch modulation will be a vertical advance, laying the foundation for transformative therapies for human diseases. Our proposal is innovative in key ways: 1) the hypothesis that H3.3 can function as a controllable epigenetic switch brings fresh ways of thinking to the cell and developmental biology and epigenetic fields, opening the door to therapeutically directing cellular plasticity and differentiation; 2) a focus on novel specific H3.3 functions including specific target genes, cofactors such as PRC2 and MYC, and 3D chromatin mechanisms; and 3) the new combination of powerful tools (e.g. H3.3 KO mice and cellular reprogramming) and innovative approaches such as single cell transcriptomics and gene editing of human cells. Overall, important advances in the knowledge and future treatment of stem cell-related diseases are expected. In addition, a deeper fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of epigenetic switches and cellular plasticity are anticipated."
"9304366","Our main goal is to identify the transcript expression changes induced by mutations in microtubule-related genes associated with schizophrenia (SZ) and stress exposure in human cell and mouse models, which are enriched among genes specifically regulated in adolescent human brains and differentially expressed in psychiatric disease conditions, such as SZ. Aim 1 will examine the transcript expression changes in iPS cells- derived human neuronal cells resulting from CRISPR/Cas9 mediated mutagenesis of KCTD13, DPYSL2, SDCCAG8 and CKAP5 by conducting a RNA-seq analysis. We will also use these genetic cell models to determine changes in transcript expression with and without treatment with dexamethasone as a model of stress exposure in vitro. Aim 2 will examine the transcript expression changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of Pcm1 knockout mice, 16p11(dup) mice model, 16p11(dup)/Kctd13+/- mice, and other mouse models such as Dpysl2 conditional knockout mice by conducting a RNA-seq analysis. We will also examine if observed changes are exacerbated by adolescent social isolation. Aim 3 will compare genomic regions and transcripts identified in Aims 1 and 2 as differentially expressed due to genetic mutations and stress exposure in cell and mouse models to transcripts and genes identified in large-scale postmortem human brain tissue RNA-seq collections. Using unique human post-mortem RNA-seq datasets, we will address whether our findings can be translated in two contexts relevant to human adolescent brain maturation and psychiatric disease conditions. We will also cross-validate differentially expressed stress-associated molecules in serum of prospective human subjects developed SZ and mouse models resulting from genetic mutations and social isolation as well as adolescent human brains and PFC region of the mouse models."
"9387180","Until recently, no animal model of Parkinson's disease (PD) has adequately incorporated both widespread alpha-synuclein (?-syn) pathology and protracted significant nigrostriatal degeneration. In 2012, Luk and colleagues described how intrastriatal injection of synthetic ?-syn preformed fibrils (PFFs) into wildtype (WT) mice seeded endogenous accumulation of Lewy Body (LB)-like intracellular ?-syn inclusions and ultimate nigrostriatal degeneration. In light of the fact that the rat model system offers distinct advantages over mice (fine motor behaviors, greater synaptic complexity, genetics and pharmacokinetics more similar to humans, larger brain and body size more amenable to neurosurgical interventions and sample collection), we recently characterized the results of unilateral injection of mouse ?-syn PFFs into the striatum of rats. Similar to the mouse, we observed phosphorylated ?-syn intraneuronal accumulations in several areas that innervate the striatum, most prominently the frontal and insular cortices, the amygdala, and the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). ?-Syn accumulations co-localized with ubiquitin, p62, and were thioflavin-S-positive and proteinase-k resistant. Although ?-syn inclusions within the SNpc remained ipsilateral to striatal injection, we observed bilateral reductions in nigral dopamine neurons 6 months following ?-syn PFF injection. Further, PFF injected rats exhibited reductions in striatal dopaminergic innervation as well as deficits in striatal dopamine and metabolites. This initial study demonstrates that ?-syn PFFs are sufficient to seed the pathological conversion and propagation of endogenous ?-syn to induce a progressive, neurodegenerative model of ?-synucleinopathy in rats. In the present IGNITE application we seek to identify which ?-syn species (human, mouse, rat) results in consistent loss of 60% nigral dopamine neurons over the course of 4 months after intrastriatal injection into rats (Aim 1). Once identified, we will conduct internal validation studies to systematically characterize the time course and magnitude of ?-syn pathology, striatal dopamine and metabolite loss, levels of striatal dopaminergic innervation (tyrosine hydroxylase, vesicular monoamine transporter, and dopamine transporter) and deficits in motor behaviors (Aim 2). Lastly, we will conduct PD-relevant external validation studies including: 1) investigating whether PFF-induced motor deficits are reversible with levodopa and 2) conduct non-invasive longitudinal in vivo imaging of nigrostriatal DA synthesis, storage and turnover using positron emission tomography (PET) (Aim 3). We propose that optimization, internal validation and external validation studies in the progressive rat ?-syn PFF PD model will allow for direct comparison to clinical metrics in PD patients and facilitate the development of novel disease modifying therapies."

Dr. Terry Watnick, the  Baltimore PKD Center Director, will manage the Pilot and Feasibility Program. She will be responsible for  recruiting proposals and for assigning each application to two qualified reviewers, one who will be external to  the B-PKD Center. We anticipate that two meritorious proposals will be funded each year with additional  proposals funded at the University of Maryland through the Dean's office in Years 2-4. Pilot studies chosen for  year 1 are tightly focused around Core Resources and recruit two new investigators with unique areas of  expertise to the study of polycystic kidney disease. Pilot 1 will focus on ciliary signaling in cardiac myocytes  and will also investigate the role of polycystin-2 in this cell type. Pilot 2 stems from the observation that  ADPKD is associated with the occurrence of supernumerary centrioles. This proposal will use unique animal  models to test the hypothesis that that centriole amplification may promote renal cyst formation. In summary,  the Pilot and Feasibility Program will continue to be instrumental in encouraging new investigators to join the  PKD field, in developing new research directions and in attracting diverse talent to the study of polycystic  kidney disease."
"9318521","The primary goal ofthe proposed BUILD initiative is to strengthen the ability of California State University, Long Beach (CSULB) to develop a pipeline for advanced doctoral degrees for those population groups most underrepresented in biomedical research. First generation-educated racial and ethnic minorities, people with disabilities, and those from disadvantaged backgrounds are gravely underrepresented in the biomedical disciplines. Data collected as part of our NIH BUILD Planning Grant reinforce the need to address the institutional and contextual barriers that underrepresented students (URS) often face when pursuing biomedical research careers. Through our CSULB BUILD initiative, we will develop and sustain an innovative and transformative infrastructure to engage and retain URS and provide them with exceptional research training and skills that will make them highly competitive for doctoral programs and entry into the biomedical workforce. The specific aims of this initiative are to: 1) Develop student outreach efforts, as well as student and faculty training opportunities, during an initial ramp-up period with our pipeline and research partners; 2) Establish a student research development program that engages URS earlier in their academic development, is larger in scope, and is culturally-responsive to our diverse student population; and 3) Work with our pipeline and research partners to provide cross-campus research opportunities and a sustainable research infrastructure for strengthening the URS doctoral pipeline. Furthermore, institutionalization of these efforts will be accomplished by strengthening the collaboration between our diverse biomedical programs and departments, our community college partners, and NIH-funded mentors at our research partner institutions. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Increased representation of underrepresented students (URS) in biomedical research is imperative to best serve the nation's diverse population and its complex health challenges. The proposed CSULB BUILD initiative aims to develop a sustainable and transformative infrastructure that will engage and retain URS in the biomedical doctoral pipeline through exceptional and innovative research training."
"9314341","BIOSTATISTICS AND BIOINFORMATICS CORE E ABSTRACT  Project Summary  Traditionally, much IDD research has focused on a single domain, e.g., either neuroimaging or behavior; either  animal research or human research; either genetics or neuroimaging. Today, the state of the science is  evolving into far more complex combinations of data from multiple viewpoints (e.g., genetic, neuroimaging, and  behavioral data), which together can propel the next generation of IDD research aimed at discovering how to  better identify, prevent, and intervene for those with IDDs. Thus, there is a great need to determine the most  effective ways to combine and to analyze these multiple types and sources of data. Furthermore, for data types  that are inherently multidimensional (e.g., genetics or neuroimaging), a second challenge becomes apparent:  many of these approaches require big sample sizes. Therefore, an additional focus of Core E is to explore  ways of effectively utilizing large repositories of data (BioVU/Synthetic Derivative). While these data sources  are advantageous in size, navigating them is a daunting process for most investigators. Within this context, the  overarching objective of Core E is to leverage the considerable statistical and bioinformatics expertise at VU  and VUMC in order to push the current boundaries of design and analyses in the service of innovative  discoveries in IDD. Against this backdrop, Core E has three aims: Aim 1 is to provide statistical consultation to  IDDRC investigators in implementing state-of-the art approaches to experimental design, statistical analysis,  and interpretation of findings. Core E provides behavioral and biobehavioral statistical consultations to IDDRC  investigators and their trainees who need guidance on basic or innovative research study design; efficient data  collection and storage; proper method evaluation and implementation; and data analyses and interpretation.  Aim 2 is to develop new bioinformatics platforms for automation of data processing from multiple sources and  to implement less widely used or novel data analysis approaches in IDD research. Aim 3 is to create IDD-  specific databases from large-scale electronic medical record and genomic resources at VUMC and to provide  corresponding training and support services. These Aims meet the needs of IDDRC investigators, including the  U54 Research Project, while also generating new platforms, processes, and analytic methods that advance  translational IDD science."
"9269203","This Technology Research and Development (TR&D) project aims to provide advanced, quantitative body MRI methods that can quickly be integrated into clinical testing or research studies. The development of MRI methods that have clinical impact demands substantial iteration based on feedback from human studies. An integral part of this project is to work closely with numerous collaborations to speed development of highimpact imaging solutions to clinical problems. This proposal is primarily focused on techniques to image cancer, renal function and osteoarthritis-related conditions, though numerous other applications will likely emerge from the broad array of collaborations and service projects. The overall goals of this project are divided into 3 specific aims: (1) to offer a complete quantitative volumetric dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) acquisition, reconstruction and post-processing suite that is robust to motion, static and radiofrequency magnetic field variations and the presence of fat, (2) to develop highresolution quantitative diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) methods that are robust to the challenges of motion in the body, and (3) to disseminate advanced musculoskeletal methods including a 5-minute 3D morphologic (fat and water) and quantitative (T2, T2* and diffusion) imaging method as well as a novel, rapid approach to distortion-corrected imaging near metallic implants. Collaborations will include numerous investigators who lead research projects and clinical services that utilize all methods in the aims. The project will leverage technology development within the Biomedical Technology Resource Center as well as other funded projects, including advanced sampling, compressed sensing, novel motion correction, multiband imaging, rapid steady-state imaging, quantitative signal model fits, and new approaches to imaging near metal. The main focus will be to combine technologies into robust implementations that can be used routinely in research studies and clinical settings."
"9407463","PROJECT SUMMARY In the US, roughly 1 in 5 children experience a mental health problem severe enough to warrant intervention; 70-80% of them receive treatment in the education sector. However, schools are often unable to deliver high- quality evidence-based treatments. The goal of this project is to improve the quality of school-based mental health (SMH) services by leveraging health information technology to facilitate measurement-based care (MBC)?an evidence based practice that utilizes client or caregiver reported data to monitor treatment progress and inform clinical decision-making. MBC has consistently been shown to improve mental health treatment outcomes for youth and adults, leading to faster recovery. Although MBC is not routinely used in schools, our prior work has found that digital measurement feedback systems, which gather client-generated treatment outcome data and deliver results to clinicians, can facilitate MBC. Despite increasingly widespread use in specialty mental health settings, no commercially available measurement feedback systems have been developed or adapted for use in the school context. Given the compelling evidence for the effectiveness of MBC, the broad influence of SMH, and the current lack of measurement feedback systems designed for schools, we propose to adapt and market a measurement feedback system known as OwlOutcomes? (or Owl) for SMH. Using the Contextualized Technology Adaption Process, which details a sequence of phases for adapting existing health information technology to novel settings, and incorporating user-centered design methodology, which emphasizes iterative development of parsimonious and compelling products, the current proposal will maximize the usability, compatibility, and utility of an innovative product?Owl for Schools (Owl-S)?to optimally support the implementation of MBC in schools. In Aim 1, (a) an evaluation of the implementation context (i.e., SMH) and (b) an assessment of the un-adapted Owl via lab-based usability testing with SMH clinicians will inform the adaption of Owl for SMH; (c) an evaluation of the usability, compatibility, and utility of the modified Owl (Owl-S) via in vivo field testing will identify additional adaptations needed. In Aim 2, a pilot randomized trial of the fully adapted Owl-S will assess (a) the impact of access to Owl-S on SMH clinicians? use of measurement-based care, as well as (b) Owl-S? ease of implementation in SMH as indicated by school clinicians? rating of its usability, compatibility and utility. The completion of these Aims will result in a measurement feedback system adapted for SMH use, that is easily implementable (Aim 2b) and effective in increasing MBC use (Aim 2a) and thus improving SMH care quality. The ~14,000 school districts in the US represent a total addressable market of $17.5M per annum, based on a SaaS model and an annual subscription fee of $250/clinician (~5 per district). This STTR will support the product adaptation and validation of Owl-S and in so doing create an innovative product that will fill a need in a very large and currently untapped market, with the ultimate goal of improving the public health impact of school-based mental health."
"9355659","Waisman Center investigators study Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD) through elucidation of molecular pathways that are altered in genetic and epigenetic conditions affecting nervous system function. Compared with other genetically tractable model organisms, rodents afford the highest similarity to humans in anatomy, physiology, and genetics. Thus, study of IDD has relied on development of rodent models of various disorders. In recent years, complementary development of human stem cell-based models to study similar processes has greatly expanded the scope and relevance of studies of IDD. Investigators of the Waisman Center have spearheaded research in a number of IDD conditions, and many investigators rely on complementary mouse and human stem cell models to study different facets of these disorders. Use of these models provides the means to evaluate candidate therapeutics, as well as develop novel screens to identify promising compounds. The resources of the IDD Models Core, almost all housed within the Waisman Center itself, provide the tools for development of mouse and human stem-cell derived models of IDD. Therefore, we propose two specific aims for the next project period. Aim 1 is to create and analyze rodent models of IDD. The objectives of this aim are to: 1) provide advanced technical services in the generation, cryopreservation, and maintenance of mutant or genetically engineered strains of mice and rats; 2) provide advanced behavioral testing services and facilities for the phenotypic characterization of novel strains of rodents; 3) provide training and consultation to investigators and laboratory personnel; and 4) facilitate maintenance and exchange of unique rodent models between institutions. Aim 2 is to to develop human stem cell models of IDD and facilitate phenotyping of neurodevelopmental defects. The objectives of this aim are to: (1) support the generation of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines directly from individuals diagnosed with IDD; (2) support development of IDD-specific PSC lines through genome editing; (3) provide high quality, cost effective, cellular and molecular neuroscience technology and expertise to IDDRC investigators to facilitate phenotyping of neurodevelopmental defects in human PSC derived cells and (4) provide training and technical support in human stem cell culture, phenotyping and gene editing to promote usage of new approaches by our investigators. These initiatives are further served by state-of-the-art imaging and molecular biology analysis tools housed within the Waisman Center. With support from the Administrative Core, linkages are provided to complementary capabilities elsewhere on campus, such as those offered by the UW Biotechnology Center, UW Comprehensive Cancer Center, and other partnerships. These resources and partnerships are leveraged to facilitate usage of a large repertoire of techniques to enhance multidimensional analysis of IDD models, and to promote the development and testing of potential therapeutics."
"9208467","Project Summary Anemia is one of the most widespread clinical conditions, affecting over 1.6 billion individuals globally, with the greatest burden among pregnant women and young children. Anemia has been associated with increased risk of adverse health outcomes, including maternal and infant mortality, and impaired cognitive function in children and work capacity in adults. The burden of anemia in India is among the highest in the world, where it exacts a heavy toll in terms of maternal and infant mortality, disability, and lost productivity. Anemia affects an estimated 56% of women of reproductive age, 59% of pregnant women, 63% of lactating women, and 70% of young children in India. Iron deficiency is the leading cause of anemia worldwide, and iron supplementation is the standard of care for prevention and treatment of anemia. However, it is estimated that only approximately 50% of anemia is due to iron deficiency. Other nutritional factors, particularly vitamins B12 and folate, and non-nutritional factors such as inflammation, also contribute to the etiology of anemia and impact human health. Treating anemia with the incorrect micronutrient may exacerbate the condition or mask the true deficiency. Accurate determination of the multifactorial causes of anemia is critical to implement successful interventions; however, existing diagnostic methods for anemia are typically time consuming, expensive, require cold chain, and are not easily accessible in resource-limited settings. In this application, we propose to develop and validate AnemiaPhone, a point-of-care, low-cost, smartphone-based platform for a multiplexed, quantitative assessment of B-vitamin status (vitamin B12 and folate), in addition to iron status, and inflammation, the leading causes of anemia. The technology consists of a disposable test-strip containing reagents required for a multiplex sandwich ELISA, a reusable low-cost smartphone accessory, which accepts the test strip after the finger stick blood sample has been introduced and attaches it to the smartphone, and a smartphone application that extracts images of the test strip captured by the smartphone camera, interprets image data to provide quantitative test results, and communicates and catalogues data. This application directly responds to the call in the funding opportunity announcement for re-engineering of existing medical devices to significantly improve conditions of the poorest populations by providing affordable and accessible healthcare in resource-limited settings. It brings together a team of experts from St. John's Research Institute in India and Cornell University in the United States in diverse areas including nutrition, medicine, perinatal health, infectious disease, nanotechnology, microfluidic technologies, and engineering to target anemia, an urgent public health problem in India and other resource-limited settings. Availability of AnemiaPhone within the next two years will make it possible to reliably and accurately diagnose anemia in even the most remote parts of India with little training required. Furthermore, given the widespread prevalence of anemia, this technology will benefit low-resource settings globally. The impact of this translational research and the development of a point-of-care, low-cost, smartphone-based platform to reduce the adverse health and development consequences associated with anemia in resource-limited settings cannot be overemphasized."
"9352858","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite recent advances in treatment, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) remains the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the elderly population. A shift in the current therapy paradigm will require more sensitive methods of identifying patients at greatest risk for disease development, progression, and poor treatment response. Previously-investigated genetic polymorphisms account for only a portion of AMD risk. Other factors include not only health risks, such as smoking and exposure to other toxins, but also individual metabolism of toxins, drugs, dietary supplements, and perhaps even food. Indeed, comprehensive measurement of metabolites in fluid or tissue has successfully identified risk factors for other chronic diseases, including heart failure, diabetes, and Parkinson's disease. Nevertheless, metabolism is influenced largely by genetic factors. Thus, our long-term goal is to develop profiles combining genetic and metabolic factors to predict disease risk and treatment response in order to improve clinical outcomes for AMD patients. The objective of this proposal is more focused: to discern metabolic profiles related to AMD pathogenesis and determine their relationship to AMD-related genetic variants. Our central hypothesis posits that metabolic profiles combined with genetic variation drive an individual's risk for AMD development, progression, and response to treatment. Using high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and Sequenom-based genotyping, we will test this hypothesis in two established independent cohorts, along with a new prospective patient cohort recruited from the Vanderbilt Eye Institute. In Aim 1, measuring plasma metabolites in AMD patients and controls will tell us the metabolic differences between these groups and between different stages of AMD. These metabolic variances will point to molecules and pathways that are associated with AMD and could serve as targets for therapeutic intervention. In Aim 2, we will combine these metabolic profiles with genotypes for known AMD-risk genes to determine how metabolites and gene variants interact to influence AMD development and progression. This approach will give us molecular insight into the variability in disease progression among patients. Finally, Aim 3 will prospectively evaluate the impact of metabolic and genetic profiles on intermediate AMD progression and NVAMD treatment response. Successful completion of these aims will provide critical knowledge of metabolic changes associated with AMD and will help identify patients at greatest risk for disease progression and poor treatment response."
"9514405","Epidemiological data show a dramatic increase in opioid and heroin use, largely due to nonmedical use of opioid prescription medications. Nationwide efforts to reduce diversion of prescription opioids appeared to show a leveling of opioid overdose mortality rates but accompanied by a sharp increase in heroin overdose mortality rates from 2012 to 2013. Unfortunately, despite increased focus on stopping the spread of the opioid epidemic, the most recent data show both opioid and heroin use and overdose mortality rates are again increasing. Opioid abuse has traversed social, economic, and geographic boundaries. The current opioid and heroin crisis is like no other experienced in recent history. Most current heroin users started with physical addiction to prescription opioids. Unlike previous cohorts of heroin users, the majority of new heroin users are White, middle class, and live in nonurban areas. There is a lack of research on drug user populations in suburban communities. The broad goal of this revised R15 application is to fill the gap in our understanding of opioid and heroin use patterns in suburban communities where opioid use is epidemic. The study includes two specific aims: (Aim 1) To examine opioid and heroin use initiation, trajectories, settings, situations, and risk practices; (Aim 2) To compare opioid and heroin use patterns by race, ethnicity, and gender. Our qualitative study triangulates ethnographic field research and in-depth interviews conducted in three suburban field sites that differ by size, location, and demographics. The sample will consist of 180 opioid and/or heroin users living in suburban communities around Boston, Massachusetts (N=60), New Haven, Connecticut (N=60), and Atlanta, Georgia (N=60). We will use targeted, snowball, and theoretical sampling methods. Our novel use of qualitative methods with Bayesian analysis and data visualizations to illustrate transition patterns in opioid and heroin use among suburban populations is an innovation of this study design. Our collaborative and skilled research team is led by multiple PIs and includes experienced investigators who have worked together successfully on drug research projects. Our aims build on our previous suburban studies examining new trends in suburban drug use and are a logical extension of our earlier research. This study responds to an urgent need to know why opioid and heroin abuse continue to increase and what prevention and intervention programs are needed to address the opioid epidemic. Our findings will inform health care efforts targeted to suburban populations of opioid and heroin users. A more comprehensive understanding of suburban drug use, risk environments, and social context can also inform larger epidemiological studies on opioid transitions, route of administration practices, and other risk behaviors in diverse suburban areas where opioid and heroin use are increasing."
"9350249","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Schizophrenia is a disorder that affects both higher-level neurocognitive operations (e.g., verbal memory, executive functioning) and lower-level perceptual processes (e.g., auditory processing). These deficits contribute to the poor community outcome and severe functional disability seen in patients. Effectively treating the cognitive dysfunction associated with this illness is important to achieve improvements in daily functioning. Recent meta-analytic studies report that cognitive training in schizophrenia has a moderate effect-size impact on cognitive functioning and a lower impact on daily functioning. However, most training interventions for schizophrenia have only targeted higher- order cognitive processes. A few recent interventions have targeted basic perceptual processing and shown that auditory and visual perceptual abilities can be trained and improved in patients with schizophrenia. These findings suggest that basic perceptual processing may be an ideal target for intervention. At this point, it is still unclear whether a neuroplasticity-based, bottom-up intervention is more effective than an intervention that targets top-down functions like attention, working memory, and executive functioning. The current CDA proposal will contrast a bottom-up intervention targeting basic auditory processes and a top-down intervention targeting higher-order cognitive functions, compared with a control condition, in Veterans with schizophrenia. These interventions will be assessed by their effects on representative measures from three outcome domains: 1) neurocognition, 2) electroencephalography (EEG), and 3) functional capacity. Participants will be randomly assigned to the bottom-up auditory training, top-down cognitive training, or control treatment (commercial computer games). All treatments will be administered three times a week (1 hour each) for 12 weeks. A comprehensive battery of cognitive, electrophysiological, and functional measures will be administered at baseline and at completion of treatment. We will enroll 120 Veterans with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder across the 4 years of the study. This proposal will determine which training approach leads to the largest magnitude of improvement in neurocognition, functional capacity, and neural functioning measured with EEG. Moreover, it will shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying the response to training. By determining whether it is more beneficial to treat lower-level perceptual processes or higher-level cognitive functions, the results of the proposed research will inform future recovery-based cognitive remediation interventions for Veterans with schizophrenia."
"9227238","Summary The severe acute and chronic developmental and neurological impacts of PKU seen in infants and adults are due to the presence of high concentrations of phenylalanine (Phe) in the blood. In pregnant mothers with PKU, high Phe levels significantly increase the risk of miscarriage or severe developmental disorders in the growing fetus. The adverse effects of PKU can be alleviated by lowering systemic levels of Phe, and various interventions (pharmacological, enzymatic, and diet-related) have been attempted with some success. This work is based on that hypothesis that highly active enzymes delivered by probiotic bacteria that utilize Phe as substrate can re- direct its flux away from the apical amino acid transporters in the gut and thus minimize Phe absorption in the gut. The long-term goal of this work is to develop this Altered Probiotic Therapy (APT) approach for the treatment of PKU. The objective of this proposal is to engineer the activity of a probiotic organism to deliver therapeutic Phenylalanine Ammonia Lyase (PAL) enzyme to the gut and to enhance residence time for efficient Phe depletion. The APT approach can provide a novel and holistic approach to treating the various Phe-related metabolic disorders including PKU, maternal PKU, and hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA)."
"9394447","ABSTRACT In comparison to the general population, prelingually deaf people experience poorer educational attainment, employment/income attainment, and mental and physical health. Yet, recent research indicates the presence of both positive and negative adaptations to being deaf in a predominantly hearing society. Deaf individuals? ability to develop effective hearing loss management skills undoubtedly contributes to better or poorer lifespan outcomes. However, research to date has not undertaken a sufficiently broad approach to understanding how key biological, psychological, and social resources, beyond hearing and speech alone, interact to influence the development and effective use of hearing loss management skills. Nor has prior research explored how deaf persons utilize such management skills differently across different social contexts (e.g., in the general society vs. in the deaf community). This exploratory R21 project seeks to identify, and examine the interaction among, a range of biopsychosocial factors predicted to be relevant to effective management of deafness across different social contexts (i.e., at individual, group, and societal levels, à la Thompson, 2016). The proposed research employs a linked mixed-methods study design and community-based participatory research elements. In Phase I (Aim 1) of the study, qualitative data is gathered from fifteen key informant interviews and three focus groups (N=5 in each), involving a diverse sample of deaf adults with differing resources, experiences, and varied degrees of success, regarding the management of hearing loss. Three focus groups of hearing persons (N=5 in each), varied in their perceptions of and experiences with deaf people, will provide innovative societal-level input regarding successful management of hearing loss. After standard coding and thematic analysis yields initial Phase I results, two deaf community forum feedback sessions will help refine those results prior to dissemination, and also help fine-tune our plan for the Phase II (Aim 2) study methods. In Phase II, an array of quantitative methods (audiometry, self-report data, psychological testing, and various standardized measures) will be employed with 100 prelingually deaf subjects to identify key biopsychosocial precursors that influence the development of effective psychosocial management skills, as well as measure the effectiveness and outcomes of those management skills themselves. Another round of deaf community feedback follows the Phase II data collection, to inform our final conclusions. The results of this exploratory research project will identify and describe how key biopsychosocial resources interact with each other across different social contexts to influence the development of prelingually deaf persons? psychosocial management skills. A deeper understanding of how individual, group, and societal contextual factors influence the development and expression of deaf persons? hearing loss management skills will help guide future research and direct interventions toward optimizing prelingually deaf persons? various lifespan outcomes."
"9382502","PROJECT ABSTRACT Elevated blood pressure (BP), including hypertension (HTN) and preHTN, affects 2 in 3 American adults and is a major contributor to cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Despite widespread use of pharmacotherapy, only about half of HTN is controlled, highlighting a need for innovative strategies to decrease the burden of elevated BP. Though regular exercise in the form of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) occurring in bouts of at least 10 minutes is recommended to decrease BP, we propose that reducing time spent sitting or `sedentary behavior' (SED) is a distinct, novel strategy that could lower BP in individuals with preHTN and HTN. Recent occupational and leisure changes (e.g., computers, video streaming) have resulted in more than half of the American day being spent in SED. At the same time, many observational studies have linked excessive SED with adverse outcomes, including HTN and CVD. Moreover, same day laboratory studies suggest that reducing or interrupting SED decreases BP acutely and our preliminary data suggest that systolic BP (SBP) is reduced by 4-6 mmHg after a 12-week SED intervention. Yet, there have been no robust, randomized trials of sufficient size and duration to demonstrate that reducing SED has sustained benefits on BP. Before clinical or public health SED recommendations can be made, such experimental evidence is imperative. Thus, the goal of this application is to demonstrate the efficacy of SED reduction to decrease BP in a 3-month randomized, clinical trial (intervention vs. control) in 300 adults (150 per group) with pre-to-Stage I HTN who have structured, prolonged SED as desk workers. We will use our proven approach that intervenes on multiple levels (individual, environmental modification with a sit-stand desk attachment) and utilizes behavioral strategies (individual counseling, self-monitoring, external prompting with a wrist-worn monitor light-intensity physical activity (LPA) (standing, light movement) and short spurts (<10 min) of activity (sporadic MVPA) as replacement behaviors. We will comprehensively study the effects of our intervention on vascular health by assessing resting BP, ambulatory BP, and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) (Aim 1) and key potential mechanisms (plasma renin activity, aldosterone) (Aim 2). We will use objective activity monitoring to evaluate dose-response relationships between amount of achieved SED reduction (and resulting increases in LPA and sporadic MVPA) with changes in outcomes (Aim 3). We will also study adiposity, fitness, and insulin sensitivity as exploratory outcomes that could change with our intervention, and if so, might relate to BP. Results from this study will determine whether decreasing SED can improve BP and vascular health and inform the necessary dose of SED reduction for clinically meaningful benefits. Also, evaluation of our novel intervention approach will inform future interventions for SED research and for designing translatable, population-level programs. If SED reduction improves BP, it could provide an important additional tool in the fight against elevated BP and CVD. and text messaging). These strategies will facilitate a targeted 2-4 hr/day SED reduction by increasing"

"9371281","Project Summary The aging population in the United States is becoming more racially and ethnically diverse than ever before. Health disparities have been well documented across diverse older adult populations, including evidence to suggest that there may be increased rates of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related disorders among some groups. Researched aimed at understanding, preventing and ameliorating health disparities in AD is a major public health priority. However, to study and address these health disparities requires psychometrically sound and culturally appropriate assessment tools to sensitively measure early clinical signs associated with AD and to provide good outcome measures to track disease progression and response to treatment. The measurement properties of such assessment tools must be conceptually and psychometrically equivalent across diverse populations. With previous NIA funding (Farias, AG 0215111, AG 031252) we developed a novel questionnaire-based assessment tool (the Everyday Cognition scales (ECog) to measure very early limitations in everyday functions. Our work has shown that subtle changes in everyday functions, as measured by the ECog, can be used to identify older adults at increased risk for developing Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and dementia. However, our most recent work has shown that the current version of the ECog is less sensitive to predicting disease progression in ethnic/racial minority subgroups (Latinos and African Americans) than it is in non-Latino Caucasians. Such findings provide clear rationale for the need to adapt and further refine this instrument to improve its utility as an early indicator of disease and as an outcome measure among diverse populations. The proposed study will utilize a multi-method (quantitative and qualitative) approach to evaluate and improve the measurement equivalence of the ECog among diverse older adult populations. The aims of this study are twofold. In Aim 1 we will utilize existing data from the University of California, Davis Alzheimer Disease Center's multiethnic longitudinal cohort to quantitatively evaluate which items of the ECog display evidence of poor measurement equivalence across three racial/ethnic groups (African Americans, Latinos, and non-Latino Caucasians) using sophisticated analytic methods. Informed by results of Aim 1, Aim 2 will employ well-established cognitive interviewing methods to further evaluate and identify the reasons why particular ECog items are problematic for specific racial/ethnic groups. For example, some items may not be readily understood as intended and/or some items may not be appropriate the cultural context and lifestyle of some groups. These items will be modified accordingly and a second wave of cognitive interviews will further evaluate item revisions. Completion of this study will provide the critical formative work to improve our ability to measure early changes in everyday function with comparable accuracy and precision across diverse older adult populations."
"9503223","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a critical national need for educational innovations that recruit undergraduate students to pursue STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) disciplines that fill the pipeline with scientists who conduct research in areas relevant to the NIH mission, and, in particular, that of NIDDK. Moreover, there is a dearth of STEM-oriented undergraduate students from whom to recruit into STEM careers, particularly those students from geographically- and economically-disadvantaged backgrounds and underrepresented racial and ethnic minority groups and Native Americans. Also, shortfalls in STEM achievement in K-12 students threaten the pipeline for entry of STEM undergraduates into advanced studies and the STEM workforce. These factors are major educational challenges that require innovations to overcome. The proposal seeks to help recruit, prepare and increase the numbers of undergraduate students that pursue STEM disciplines relevant to the NIDDK mission. We hypothesize that: 1) an intense research experience for undergraduate students involving crafting of questions, designing and conducting experiments, and presenting and arguing results will help develop their STEM acumen and recruit them into STEM careers; and 2) the research experience in diabetic nephropathy will help recruit them into STEM disciplines that serve as a foundation for investigation of renal biology and disease, and particularly diabetic renal disease. The proposal capitalizes on a 3-year pilot educational initiative, funded by a NIDDK ARRA supplemental grant, that established a novel AspirnautTM K-20 STEM pipeline (www.aspirnaut.org) for recruiting and developing diverse undergraduate and high school students for STEM careers. The research theme is the Pathobiology of Diabetic Nephropathy. This theme is a primary research focus of the Division of Nephrology and the Center for Matrix Biology at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. The Specific Aims are: Aim 1. To provide research experience for 15 undergraduate students on the topic of Pathobiology of Diabetic Nephropathy. Aim 2. To target 40% of participants to be underrepresented racial and ethnic groups and Native Americans and 70% from geographically- and economically-disadvantaged backgrounds. Aim 3. To teach 15 undergraduate students how to be mentors and inspirational role models for elementary and middle school students at rural schools. The outcomes are anticipated to help recruit increased numbers of undergraduates from disadvantaged and underrepresented groups into STEM disciplines of relevance to the NIDDK mission."

Funded by NIA in 2009, the Wisconsin ADRC will support seven well-integrated Cores, including a new Neuroimaging Core, that will support a full-spectrum of timely, innovative research including studies that will: 1) target antecedent biomarkers of preclinical stages of AD, 2) investigate the neurobiology of AD, 3) identify novel vascular and genetic risk factors and linking them to the disease pathology and clinical phenotype, 4) incorporate contemporary biochemical and molecular techniques into clinical-pathologic cohort studies, including genomics, epigenomics, proteomics and next generation genetic sequencing and 5) participate and facilitate the missions of other federal, state and local agency supported aging and dementia research programs and studies.    The overall goals of the Wisconsin ADRC will be accomplished through coordinated activities of its seven Cores. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership to the ADRC as a whole. The Clinical Core will perform standardized evaluations and collect UDS and additional data on all research participants. It will work closely with the Outreach, Recruitment and Education (ORE) and the Minority Recruitment Satellite Program (MRSP) Cores to enhance enrollment of underrepresented minorities into the ADRC. The Data Management and Statistical Core will continue to meet all the data management, informatics and statistical needs of the cores. It will continue to support all the PC- and web-based services and processes. The Neuropathology Core will continue to process, evaluate, store and distribute antemortem biospecimens and postmortem tissue to support novel research in AD. The ORE Core will provide a wide-range of educational and outreach programs about AD and the missions of Wisconsin ADRC to recruit research volunteers, especially those of color into the Clinical Core and other NIA-funded initiatives, such as ADCS, ADNI, NCRAD and GWAS studies. The MRSP Core will work closely with the ORE and Clinical Cores to enhance recruitment and retention of minority participants into the ADRC. The new Neuroimaging Core will bring together all the resources and expertise of the UW in neuroimaging to develop a well-coordinated program that will significantly enhance collaborative interdisciplinary research in neuroimaging of AD and related diseases.    Successful renewal of the Wisconsin ADRC will allow the Center to continue to conduct novel studies targeting antecedent biomarkers of preclinical stages of AD. Findings from these studies will result in an early diagnosis and discovery of new treatment and prevention strategies for AD that will significantly reduce the human suffering and socio-economic devastations of the disease."
"9387500","Project Summary and Relevance  Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of serious lower respiratory tract infections and hospitalization in infants, the elderly and immunocompromised individuals. Natural infection does not induce durable protective immunity to the virus and multiple reinfections can occur even within the same year. To date, there is as yet no effective vaccine or treatment. We have developed novel RSV-virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine candidates composed of Newcastle Disease Virus nucleoprotein and membrane proteins that express RSV F and G glycoproteins ectodomains fused with NDV glycoprotein cytoplasmic domains. This VLP induces long-lived protective neutralizing antibody responses and memory B cells in mice when given once in the absence of adjuvant. Mice challenged with RSV post immunization clear the virus and do not display enhanced pulmonary disease. Because adjuvant is not required for this protective immune response, we propose that the VLP directly stimulates the innate immune system, such as TLRs or MAV. We will investigate this possibility by using mutant mouse models deficient in single components of the innate immune system and the impact on development of durable protective immunity. These studies will provide essential information for the future development of our vaccine candidate and define the most efficacious TLR agonists for clinical testing"
"9348166","Nearly half of all biomedical publications ever written have been published in the last 15 years? the era since the completion of the human genome project. The rate of increase is exponential, shows no signs of slowing down, and can be seen in all of the information sources relevant to precision medicine development. This constitutes a nearly insurmountable burden for the drug-development and diagnostics professionals who develop precision medicines. Next-generation automated evaluation of this data that will enable rapid, supportable, and innovative product-development decisions would lead to the development and approval of many more precision medicines, resulting in improved public health, decreased precision medicine time-to-market, and increased efficiency and profitability for drug-development and diagnostics companies. Developing precision medicines is exceedingly difficult due to an underlying chicken-and-egg problem: patient populations for whom a drug will be effective cannot be identified without a test, but test development is notworth justifying without a drug that is demonstrated to be effective in that population. No system for the identification of actionable precision medicine opportunities exists. The ideal approach would 1) examine multiple systems of record that impact marketplace decisions; 2) be aware of the identify of individual molecular biomarkers mentioned therein, as well as bring in technical details such as measurability and measurement method; and 3) be accessible to drug-development companies looking to define a patient population and diagnostics companies looking to develop a test to provide that definition. Therefore, the overall goal of this multi-phase SBIR project is to capitalize on our preliminary success in building a biomarker database (BiomarkerBase?) that supports this critical interface of precision medicine development decisions. Amplion's highly qualified data science R&D team will collaborate with Dr. Parag Mallick of Stanford University to pursue three Aims: 1) train a Deep Learning Model for biomarker identification in clinical trials, 2) extend Model application and prove performance for classification of biomarker usage intent, and 3) prove that Model-identified and classified biomarkers match and expand expert opinions. Showing that we can identify biomarkers and their usage classifications in clinical trials and publications will establish the predictive potential of our unique algorithms within the limited scope of this Phase I feasibility project and will set the stage for a larger Phase II demonstration. Phase I will provide data that can be incorporated directly into Amplion's BiomarkerBase? product and will allow us to assess how well our Model meets user requirements for this data. Phase II work will allow us to expand/extend this Model to cover additional sources. Phase III work (with Industry partners) will allow us to integrate this commercial service directly into customer work flows. Our next-generation capabilities will provide a critical linkage at the challenging interface between the diagnostics and drug-development efforts and will accelerate the development of novel precision medicines."
"9296173","Massively parallel sequencing (MPS) technologies generate billions of sequence reads that must be mapped  to complex genomes and interpreted. These technologies provide an unprecedented opportunity to develop  diagnostic tools and treatments for individuals with developmental disorders. However, scientists cannot make  full use of these technologies without a significant investment in computational capacity and bioinformatics  expertise. Individual scientists typically do not have the resources to justify full-time support of personnel with  bioinformatics expertise. Similarly, IDD research often involves small samples, with intensive assessment in  multiple domains such as behavior, genetics and neuroimaging, along with longitudinal analysis taking account  of developmental phenomena. These complex studies invariably require complex biostatistics methods for data  analysis and careful attention to study design to ensure optimal statistical power. By utilizing overlapping  computational resources and personnel to process complex biomedical data, this core is able to offer cost-effective  services in biostatistics and bioinformatics. The Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Core has the following  specific objectives:  1. To provide broad biostatistics support to IDDRC Investigators studying behavior, genetics, arid  basic and clinical neuroscience. The BBC offers IDDRC investigators access to biostatistics experts that can  help analyze data from preclinical, imaging and other clinical neuroscience data (e.g., EEG), genetics, and  behavioral studies. The BBC will provide biostatistics support for pilot studies, consultation on study design and  analysis, integrated analysis of multidisciplinary data, and assistance with accessing and coordinating  additional statistical resources from other UNC services.  2. To provide comprehensive bioinformatics support to IDDRC Investigators. The research questions  posed by IDDRC projects increasingly rely on 'omics' (e.g., including genomic, proteomics, epigenomics) or  other data sources, requiring substantial biostatistics and bioinformatics expertise. The BBC offers state-of-the-  art bioinformatics services and computational resources that are critically important to a large and growing  number of IDDRC investigators.  3. To provide informal and formal training in biostatistics and bioinformatics. The Core will regularly  provide informal teaching and training through consultation around design and analysis. BBC staff also  contributes to the rich educational and training environment through the provision of a variety of existing  seminars, classes, and demonstrations for trainees and investigators within the IDDRC."
"9306112","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In sprouting angiogenesis, endothelial cells from a pre-existing tube are led by actively migrating tip cells to form new vessels. In the Drosophila respiratory organ (tracheal system), primary branching is also led by tip cells. Work from us and others showed that tip cells in both systems are selected through a competition-based mechanism. In both models of branch sprouting, the tip cells are morphologically distinct, extending filopodia to sense the local environment and to lead migration up a concentration gradient of a branch-inducing signal. Subsequent to initiating and guiding the outgrowth of a new branch, tip cells execute a second essential function: they must form a tube (lumenize) in order to make the new branch functional. Tip cells hollow out to form seamless tubes that lack junctional seams (adherens junctions and tight/septate junctions). In the Drosophila tracheal system, all tip cells reside in stereotyped positions and form seamless tubes; furthermore, tracheal terminal cells form new seamless tube side branches throughout the course of larval life. These qualities, combined with the power of genetic analysis in Drosophila, have made tracheal terminal cells an exceptionally useful model for dissecting seamless tube morphogenesis.  Tip cell tube formation is critical, as it permits transport of blood or gas throug the cell; however, despite or recent progress (4 major publications in the last grant cycle), important questions remain: how does FGFR- signaling trigger distinct outputs at each stage? how does FGFR induce seamless tubes? how does FGFR regulate seamless tube branching? what are the effectors regulated downstream of FGFR?  We propose to exploit or published and preliminary data to address these questions using innovative approaches. With the twin goals of understanding how signaling is coupled to changes in the mechanism of tubulogenesis, and how the seamless tubulogenesis machinery operates downstream of FGFR, we propose the following specific aims:  Aim 1: Determine how FGFR activation induces seamless tubulogenesis. We will focus our studies of seamless tubulogenesis on the novel zinc finger transcription factor that we identify, in our preliminary data, as essential for seamless tube morphogenesis.  Aim 2: Determine how FGFR activation regulates local branching of the seamless tube. We will focus on characterization of seamless tube branching using innovative optogenetic and live imaging tools. We will follow up on our preliminary data to establish the roles of three proteins - PALS2/MPP6/2 (Drosophila Varicose), Spectroplakin (Drosophila Short stop) and Moesin - in seamless tube branching in Drosophila and in the zebrafish vascular system.  Completion of these specific aims will represent a dramatic advance in the field, connecting signal transduction to the cellular machinery of tube morphogenesis at an unprecedented level of resolution."

"9336051","The goal of this SBIR proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of an interactive, tailored, e-learning parent- based intervention (PBI-m) for parents of high school seniors that aims to reduce alcohol use and related harm among teens during the post high-school transition, an established high-risk period. The proposed PBI-m is adapted from an evidence-based curriculum in four important ways: (1) the reach of the intervention is increased by targeting parents of all high school seniors, regardless of their post-high school transitional path, (2) the intervention changes from a handbook to an interactive, e-learning format that capitalizes on increasingly tech savvy parents and facilitates rapid and widespread dissemination and sustainability, (3) content is customized based on reported parent-child communication styles to produce a more effective, individualized experience and (4) rapid dissemination to a large market is ensured through collaboration with D.A.R.E. America, a community organization with a wide presence in U.S. school districts. The curriculum motivates parents to talk with their sons and daughters about alcohol use and then teaches them communication and relationships skills for handling these difficult conversations. Research demonstrates that the hard copy version motivates them to have these conversations and, as a result, reduces youth alcohol consumption. We anticipate that technology will allow us to make the curriculum more engaging through interactivity, tailored content, and optional ?coaching? in additional content areas. During this Phase 1 project, interviews will be conducted with parents of high seniors who are transitioning to work and the military, as well as teens who have recently transitioned to work and military, rather than college to capture their experiences and perceptions. Findings will be incorporated by the project team (Hecht, Turrisi, Ray, Miller- Day) with advice from an Expert Panel to create a 4-lesson, e-learning intervention that is brief, highly interactive, engaging, and customized to individual parents and accessible through computers and tablets. An independent usability study will be conducted with parents to establish feasibility. A commitment is in place from D.A.R.E. America, the largest provider of school-based curriculum in the world, to disseminate the curriculum as part of its expanded high school program. REAL Prevention LLC has successfully developed effective substance use prevention curricula and partnered with D.A.R.E. on its dissemination in 70% of school districts in the U.S. as well as in 52 other countries. LeanForward LLC, an innovative training and e-learning design firm, will collaborate on this adaptation. The project team also includes Dr. Turrisi, curriculum developer, and an Expert Panel.

"9383474","Summary/Abstract This application describes chemical approaches for determining the role of protein cysteine glutathionylation in the sarcomere. Sarcomere is a basic unit of myofibrils in muscle. Sarcomere contains numerous sarcomeric proteins, including titin, actin and myosin, that form a highly organized structure for continuous contraction of muscle. In muscle cell, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) are emerging as critical signaling molecules that strongly contribute to physiology and pathology associated with heart function. However, the precise molecular target proteins of ROS and their redox-based regulatory mechanisms that affect sarcomere stability and integrity remain unknown. Glutathionylation is one of the major protein cysteine oxidative modifications that mediate the role of ROS in redox signaling and oxidative stress. This application is based on our recently developed chemical approach, i.e. clickable glutathione for identification and characterization of glutathionylation. SET and MYND domain-containing protein 2 (SMYD2) is an abundant protein in heart and skeletal muscle. With clickable glutathione, we found that SMYD2 is selectively glutathionylated at C13, and SMYD2 C13 glutathionylation is a crucial mechanism by which ROS induce sarcomere destabilization in cardiomyocytes. The main goal of application is to identify sarcomeric proteins, including SMYD2, that are susceptible to glutathionylation in response to ROS and to characterize functional roles of protein glutathionylation in regulating sarcomere stability. There are three specific aims. First, we plan to couple clickable glutathione with mass analysis to identify glutathionylation of SMYD2 and other sarcomeric proteins in response to ischemic conditions. Clickable glutathione approach will be used in H9c2 cell line with isotopic-labelled azido-Ala and cleavable biotin-alkyne for quantitative mass analysis of glutathionylated proteins under oxygen-glucose-deprivation. Second, we will determine sarcomere stability and integrity resulting from SMYD2 C13 glutathionylation. We will determine sarcomere stability in myocytes in response to ROS by fluorescence imaging of sarcomeric proteins, including myosin and actin. Also, we will couple clickable glutathione with proximity ligation for visualizing localization of glutathionylated SMYD2. Third, we plan to determine the molecular mechanism by which SMYD2 glutathionylation leads to sarcomere destabilization. We will synthesize site-specifically glutathionylated SMYD2, which will be used for characterizing structural and functional changes of SMYD2 C13 glutathionylation with subsequent cellular studies. Taken together, these studies will uncover the key molecular target protein and molecular mechanisms by which ROS contribute to muscle dysfunction."
"9260377","PROJECT 3 ? BIOMEDICAL PROJECT 1 (BP1) - SUMMARY With partnering Native American communities, the UNM Metals Exposure and Toxicity Assessment on Tribal Lands in the Southwest (UNM METALS) team has obtained evidence for community level exposures and health risks associated with more than 1100 abandoned uranium mine (AUM) waste sites on their tribal lands. This project will address underlying mechanisms to account for immune dysregulation, including early molecular markers of autoimmunity, associated with proximity to AUM and uranium and mixed metal exposure. Biomonitoring results confirm that community members are exposed to uranium and other metals beyond national norms. Our published and preliminary work shows that certain metals interact with key cellular targets to disrupt zinc-dependent protein function. We will test the hypothesis that metals disrupt multiple classes of zinc binding proteins known to regulate immune responses, and that supplemental zinc will mitigate immunotoxicity resulting from metal exposures. In Aim 1 aim we will investigate whether serum zinc sufficiency modifies immune dysregulation in individuals exposed to environmental metals by performing a cross-sectional analysis of archived population samples for associations between markers of immune function with metal and zinc levels present in blood and urine samples. Aim 2 will test the immunotoxic effects and underlying mechanisms of U, As and environmentally relevant metal mixtures defined by the Environmental Projects, and whether the immunotoxic effects are reduced by supplemental zinc in cell and mouse models. Aim 3 will test whether dietary zinc supplementation will decrease biomarkers of immune dysregulation in exposed populations in partnership with exposed communities. The work is innovative by combining exposure information and biomonitoring data from exposed populations with mechanistic studies in experimental models. To date, there are no significant, community-based health studies describing both exposure and immunologic outcome measures in these impacted Tribal communities. We propose a novel hypothesis that metals exposures disrupt multiple classes of Zn binding proteins critical for immune function leading to immune dysregulation and that supplemental Zn will mitigate metal toxicity. This study represents the first human intervention based on zinc supplementation to ameliorate the adverse effects of mixed metal exposures. To achieve the research goals, BP1 is well integrated with the Environmental Projects to inform distinct metals exposures, BP2 to share mechanistic data and model systems, the Community Engagement and Research Translation Cores for community input and reporting results back to the communities, and the Biostatistics and Data Management Core for research support. The outcomes from these studies will be significant by testing metals and metals mixtures of concern to communities to elucidate impact on and mechanisms of immune dysregulation as detected in exposed populations, and test the feasibility of a mechanism-based intervention to alleviate the adverse effects of metals exposures."

"9352329","The prognosis of patients with malignant gliomas remains dismal. In addition, limitations in neuroimaging complicate the clinical management of these patients and impede efficient testing of new therapeutics. While extension of MRI to the cellular and molecular level has introduced new possibilities for imaging malignant gliomas, most molecular MRI studies have been limited to the pre-clinical setting. Recently, a new type of molecular MRI contrast has become available that detects the body's own building blocks: amino acids, proteins and carbohydrates. The magnetic contrast produced by these natural species is due to the presence of groups of protons (NH, NH2, OH) that can exchange with the protons on water and, as such, affect the signal in MRI images. The nomenclature for these compounds is based on their first mechanism of detection with MRI, namely ?Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer? or ?CEST?. Amide proton transfer weighted (APTw) MRI is an endogenous CEST method with potential for improving cancer diagnosis (identifying and determining the extent of malignant disease), therapeutic monitoring (objective assessment of change in tumor burden), and distinguishing recurrent tumor from treatment effects. However, the current saturation-based approach has low specificity for amide protons due to interference of large confounding background signals from direct water saturation (DS) and conventional magnetization transfer contrast (MTC) from semisolid tissue components, as well as from signals from other endogenous CEST metabolites. We propose to address this by developing pulsed exchange transfer approaches, i.e. not based on RF saturation labeling but on proton excitation and proton frequency evolution labeling, that can remove such confounding effects.  In AIM 1, we will develop pulse sequences that can achieve magnetic labeling of exchangeable protons using trains of RF excitation pulses with variable delays. We use these to encode the exchangeable protons based on their specific chemical shift evolution (frequency encoding) and their exchange transfer properties, which allows removal of the confounding effects mentioned above. In AIM 2, the goal is quantification of the exchange transfer contrast. Using the editing methods developed in AIM 1, we will design approaches to measure absolute concentrations and validate them using known concentrations in phantoms. In vivo, the water signal used for the detection of exchange transfer will be used as an internal standard. Finally, in AIM 3, we will translate the methodology to fast 3D whole-brain scanning on animal and human systems.  These aims are expected to result in the availability of quantifiable APT contrast MRI in patients with gliomas. While we focus demonstration of the usefulness of the new methods on glioma animal models and patients, the technical developments in this proposal are expected to be important for tumor imaging in general, several other pathologies (e.g. stroke, neurodegeneration), and for the imaging of CEST contrast agents for which the interference of MTC, DS and endogeneous CEST background signals is a major problem."
"9316634","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Injuries of mature central nervous system (CNS) axons result in loss of vital functions due to the failure of CNS axons regeneration. Neutralizing extracellular inhibitory molecules yields only limited regeneration or functional recovery in vivo, suggesting a critical role for neuron-intrinsic factors. As it has become apparent that the PTEN/mTOR pathway is critical for CNS axon regeneration, understanding the regrowth control of this pathway represents the first step toward developing novel therapeutic approaches to neural injury. Unfortunately, mTOR over-activity can result in tumor formation, metabolic diseases, and neurological disorders. It is therefore critically important to identify the specific downstream effectors by which PTEN/mTOR promotes axon regeneration, and to isolate them from other targets that mediate mTOR's deleterious effects. Using the anatomical and technical advantages of retinal ganglion cell and optic nerve as a CNS injury model, we have identified crucial regulators of axon growth, and are now ideally positioned to elucidate the downstream mechanisms by which PTEN/mTOR stimulates regeneration in mature CNS axons and identify translational targets of PTEN/mTOR govern adult CNS axon regeneration. These effectors are ideal therapeutic targets to promote regeneration in CNS injury and diseases, which can be selectively activated without activating other, potentially harmful pathways, thus to assist in safely translating our findings into novel neural repair treatments to preserve vital functions in patients with CNS injuries."

"9381928","Abstract  Adolescents who receive treatment for substance use disorders (SUD) have high rates of resuming substance use after they leave treatment. Although relapse prevention is widely incorporated within SUD treatment for adolescents, tools for sustaining recovery are frequently lacking or inadequate. Smartphones have the potential to address this need by delivering Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA); EMA is a self-monitoring intervention that can be used to help people identify and better understand the antecedents, patterns, and consequences of substance use. In addition, smartphones can provide immediate access to a range of recovery supports delivered via Ecological Momentary Interventions (EMI).  As part of the P.I.?s MERIT award (R37 DA011323-14), the research team developed the Smartphone Addiction Recovery Coach for Adolescents (SARC-A) mobile application, which is based on a dynamic model of relapse prevention and utilizes smartphones to deliver recovery-oriented interventions. The applicant team completed two pilot studies in which EMAs and EMIs were delivered to adolescents via smartphones, both separately and combined. Results indicated that EMAs were reliably completed (5 to 6 per day) and accurately predicted the risk of use in the next 7 days. In addition, participants completed an average of 20 or more EMIs per day and EMI utilization was associated with reduced substance use in the next 7 days.  Building on these findings, the applicants propose the following experimental study. Adolescents (N=400) will be recruited upon their discharge from 1 of 4 outpatient treatment programs and randomly assigned to 1 of 4 conditions: (1) recovery support as usual control, (2) EMA-only, (3) EMI-only, or (4) EMA+EMI experimental conditions. Interventions will be delivered for 6 months post-discharge with quarterly assessments through 9 months. Data include standardized assessments, urine tests, mobile phone meta data, EMA responses, and EMI utilization. Study hypotheses will be tested using survival analysis, multi-level modeling and structural equation modeling of longitudinal data. The study has the following aims: Aim 1: Test the effects of EMA, EMI, and EMA+EMI (v control) on the frequency of substance use; Aim 2: Evaluate the extent to which the above effects are moderated by baseline substance use frequency; Aim 3: Test the extent to which the frequency of substance use mediates the effects of EMA, EMI, and EMA+EMI on other aspects of recovery including SUD symptoms, HIV risk behavior, quality of life, mental wellness, days of school; and Aim 4: Determine the degree to which EMA responses and EMI utilization predict the duration of abstinence."

"9527920","Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a hyperandrogenic disorder that occurs in 5-10% of premenopausal  women, often producing both infertiliy and increased risk of metabolic and cardiovascular disease. The  combined evidence obtained by our core investigators strongly supports our central hypothesis that PCOS  has a genetic basis linked to excess androgen production, and that the androgen excess programs the  pathogenesis ofthe disorder. Common metabolic features of PCOS include obesity, insulin resistance, and  hyperinsulinemia, and our studies in rodents and monkeys have revealed that prenatal androgen excess can  program development of these metabolic PCOS symptoms. Since many of these same PCOS features  develop in estrogen- or estrogen receptor alpha (ERa)-deficient rodents, and following ERa targeting in the  hypothalamus, and since prenatal androgen exposure induces resistance to many hypothalamic acfions of  estradiol (E2), we have proposed the novel hypothesis that androgenic programming of metabolic features of  PCOS is mediated by induction of hypothalamic resistance to E2. However, the mechanisms by which E2  may act in the hypothalamus to regulate energy homeostasis, metabolism, adiposity, and body weight in  women and non-human primates remains largely unknown, and the ability of androgens to program altered  hypothalamic E2 responsiveness remains untested. We will therefore determine the effects of E2 on energy  homeostasis, metabolism, and adiposity in ovariectomized marmosets. We will utilize ER-specific agonist  treatments to determine which ER isoform mediates E2 effects on metabolism in this primate. In a second  experiment we will use adeno-associated viral vectors to knock-down ERa in hypothalamic target nuclei to  ascertain the importance of discrete neuronal ER populations in the regulation of body weight and  metabolism by E2. Finally, we will determine whether prenatal and postnatal androgen excess induces  metabolic features of PCOS in marmosets, and whether any such effects are mediated by induction of  resistance to E2 actions."
"9547038","This revised Program Project Grant (PPG) application seeks an increased understanding of the relationships between dog or cat exposure during infancy and a lower risk of allergic asthma. We believe that this protective association is related to different patterns of microbial stimulation during immune development.   Four synergistic Projects will examine our hypothesis that the presence of pets in a home results in a more diverse bacterial community composition (BCC) of the dust in the home which in turn influences the development of the gut BCC of a newborn infant living in the home. A more diverse gut BCC shifts the maturation of the infant's immune system such that later immune responses are less likely to produce IgE antibody responses and allergic asthma. Project 1 examines the relationships between the presence of a dog or cat in a home, the BCC of dust in the home, the BCC of stools of infants living in homes and allergic  sensitization at 2 years of age. An innovative, culture-independent microarray (G3 PhyloChip) will be used to characterize the BCCs utilizing previously collected samples from the ongoing WHEALS birth cohort study.   Changes in home BCC following introduction of a dog are also examined. To further examine relationships between dog exposure and immune development. Project 2 will recruit a new birth cohort of children either living with or without a dog, measure infant stool BCC, and follow the cohort with detailed studies of immune function until 18 months of age to determine the impact of dog exposure on immune maturation. Project 3 uses mouse models of allergic asthma to further examine the influence of house dust from homes with and without dogs on immune responses that result in lung inflammation. The use of mouse models allows more detailed studies of immune functions from multiple compartments of the body than are possible with human children. Project 4 again utilizes the existing WHEALS birth cohort to examine the relationships between dog or cat exposure during the first year of age, 6-month infant stool BCC, and the presence of allergic asthma at  9 years of age. The Projects are supported by five Cores which each provide essential services to all four Projects."
"9316516","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal details a five-year plan to provide the candidate, William Sheehan, MD, with the knowledge and expertise to become an independent investigator in the field of Allergy and Immunology. The proposed research project is centered on a novel strategy of evaluating the amount of detectable environmental peanut protein exposure in childhood environments, such as homes, schools, and preschools. It has recently been theorized that avoidance of foods at a young age has contributed to the rise in food allergies, because children were instead becoming sensitized by cutaneous exposure to small amounts of food proteins in the environment. Dr. Sheehan presents preliminary data demonstrating detectable amounts of peanut protein (Ara h 2) in schools and homes. The candidate will use the established infrastructure of his mentor, Dr. Wanda Phipatanakul (current NIAID-funded study entitled School and Inner City Asthma Study); to further explore the study of peanut protein in the environment by analyzing vacuumed dust and table wipe samples. In addition to evaluating homes and schools, peanut-free preschools serving very young children will also be evaluated. Additionally, Dr. Sheehan will evaluate the effect of this environmental peanut exposure on health outcomes. Specifically, he will investigate the effect of exposure to environmental peanut protein on asthma morbidity with a particular focus on children considered to be at the highest risk of being affected by this cutaneous exposure. The at risk group will be defined by an enrolled subject with any one of the following conditions: (1) peanut allergy, (2) eczema, or (3) filaggrin gene mutation. Dr. Sheehan will work under the mentorship of Dr. Phipatanakul, an expert in environmental exposures and the relationship with allergic diseases. Dr. Sheehan has also assembled a team of extraordinary researchers, including Drs. Diane Gold, Raif Geha, and Brent Coull, who have committed their time, resources, and expertise to facilitate his career development and research goals. During the period of support for the candidate, he will engage in formal education on clinical research by obtaining a Master of Medical Sciences (MMSc) degree from the Scholars in Clinical Science Program at Harvard Medical School. This program will provide him with further skills in advanced biostatistics, epidemiology, clinical study design, clinical genetics, and scientific writing. Under the guidance of his primary mentor and collaborative team, in an ideal scientific and clinical environment at Boston Children's Hospital, the research project and career development plan will position the candidate to secure independent NIH funding and to establish himself as an independent clinical researcher in the field of environmental food exposures and allergic diseases, a relatively neglected area of investigation."
"9522938","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major challenge for treating cocaine addiction is the propensity for abstinent users to relapse. Two important triggers for relapse are cues associated with prior drug use and stressful life events. During my postdoctoral training, I studied mechanisms in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) underlying the withdrawal-dependent intensification (incubation) of cue-induced cocaine craving. As a PI, I will incorporate the effect of chronic stress into my studies. To date, the majority of studies investigating stress-induced relapse vulnerability have examined the effects of acute stressors on the reinstatement of previously extinguished drug seeking behavior, a model which may not accurately depict the situation of addicts, who typically do not undergo extinction training and who may relapse after a long drug-free period. Thus, there is an urgent need for animal models that explore interactions between the effects of chronic stress and drug withdrawal on cue-induced cocaine craving. To address this need, I will study the effect of chronic stress during abstinence on relapse vulnerability using the 'incubation of cocaine craving' model mentioned above, in which cue-induced drug seeking in rats progressively intensifies during the first months of withdrawal from extended-access drug self-administration. By combining my long-standing interest in addiction with my emerging interest in the neurobiology of stress, I have developed a research program that will be independent of my Mentor's research and will allow me to pursue three long-term goals: developing animal models with better face validity for addiction, using in vivo models which preserve neuronal circuits and enable correlation of cellular and behavioral results, and ultimately contributing to development of pharmacotherapies to help recovering addicts maintain abstinence. This Research Plan, along with the Training Plan I have developed with my Mentor (Dr. Marina Wolf) and co- Mentors (Dr. J. Amiel Rosenkranz and Dr. Janice Urban), will enable me to achieve my career goal of becoming an independent researcher in an academic setting.  My project draws on previous work from my co-Mentors on the basolateral amygdala (BLA), a critical region for behavioral responses to stress. Dr. Rosenkranz's lab has shown that chronic stress enhances excitatory drive in the BLA, while Dr. Urban's lab has found that repeated activation of NPY receptors in the BLA produces long-lasting stress resilience. Furthermore, recent work from the Dong lab (2013) has shown that glutamate projections from the BLA to the NAc are critical for the expression of incubated cue-induced cocaine seeking. Combining these lines of work, my central hypothesis is that cocaine withdrawal and chronic stress exposure produce a synergistic increase in BLA neuronal activity which facilitates incubation of craving, whereas treatments promoting stress resilience will prevent this facilitation by producing opposing neuroadaptations in the BLA. My preliminary data show that chronic food restriction stress during withdrawal does in fact accelerate the incubation of cocaine craving. In Aim 1 (K99), I will determine the persistence of this effect and whether it generalizes to repeated restraint stress, the form of stress used in many prior studies of the BLA. In Aim 2 (K99/R00), I will test my hypothesis that cocaine withdrawal and stress exert synergistic effects in the BLA by comparing intrinsic excitability, synaptic transmission, and morphological features of BLA neurons of rats that self-administer saline or cocaine and then either undergo repeated stress or control conditions during withdrawal. In Aim 3 (K99/R00), I will determine if NPY receptor activation in the BLA opposes the chronic stress-induced facilitation of incubation of cocaine seeking and employ biochemical methods to identify mechanisms in the BLA through which NPY signaling mediates these protective effects.  During my prior training, I secured individual pre- and postdoctoral NRSA funding, published in high impact journals, and gained expertise in behavioral and biochemical approaches. However, to undertake my proposed experiments, I need training in electrophysiology and stress models, as well as more experience with non-bench skills required for independence. To accomplish these goals, I have put together an exceptional team of advisors. My Primary Mentor Dr. Wolf is an expert in cocaine-induced neuronal plasticity who will oversee my training. Dr. Rosenkranz (co-Mentor) uses electrophysiological approaches to study the effects of stress on affective behavior and physiology of the amygdala. He will train me to conduct in vivo intracellular recordings in BLA neurons and then assess their morphology. Dr. Urban (co-Mentor) is a neuroendocrinologist who studies adaptations in the amygdala contributing to stress resilience. She will provide training on models of stress resilience and NPY signaling. I will also be guided by a Research Committee composed of my Mentor, co-Mentors, and two other electrophysiologists at my University, Drs. Kuei-Yuan Tseng and Anthony West. All of these individuals have a strong history of collaborative interactions. Together, we have developed a Training Plan that utilizes regular individual meetings with Mentors, bi-annual meetings of the Research Committee, coursework (including seminars and journal clubs), and an institutional postdoctoral development program to develop the non-bench skills needed for my transition from a postdoctoral fellow to an independent investigator in an academic setting. This training plan is strengthened by an outstanding institutional environment offering excellent facilities and a concentration of addiction researchers in a collaborative and supportive setting."

"9514441","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How epigenetic states are inherited during S phase of the cell cycle is one of the most challenging questions in the chromatin and epigenetic fields. DNA replication-coupled nucleosome assembly plays an important role in epigenetic inheritance following DNA replication and DNA repair. Mutations of most, if not all, genes involved in replication-coupled nucleosome assembly result in defects in transcriptional silencing at heterochromatin and genome instability in both yeast and mammalian cells. We have been studying how nucleosomes are formed following DNA replication in yeast and human cells and have made multiple significant contributions to this process. However, how parental histone (H3-H4)2 tetramers are transferred to replicating DNA is still poorly understood, which hinders our understanding of transmission of epigenetic information into daughter cells. The major challenge to understanding parental histone (H3-H4)2 assembly is a lack of methods to track this process. Despite this challenge, we have developed the eSPAN (enrichment and Sequencing Protein- Associated Nascent DNA) method that can discern whether a protein binds to leading or lagging strands of DNA replication forks. This method enables us for the first time to monitor nucleosome assembly of both newly synthesized and parental histone (H3-H4)2 onto leading and lagging strands of DNA replication forks. In this proposal, we will elucidate molecular mechanisms whereby parental (H3-H4)2 are assembled into nucleosomes following DNA replication and how epigenetic marks are inherited during mitotic cell division in both yeast and human cells using a combination of genetic, biochemical and genomic approaches. Together, our studies should have a profound impact on the understanding of nucleosome assembly and epigenetic inheritance."
"9390214","Project Summary The overall goal of this application is to develop hypoxia-derived prognostic biomarkers to predict breast cancer progression and patient outcome from human breast cancer tissue samples. In a previous NIH-funded project, have identified hypoxia-driven signaling networks in the breast tumor microenvironment (TME) through multimodal imaging combined with omics approaches in preclinical models. The breast TME contains several spatially heterogeneous hypoxic regions, which induce metastasis and drive angiogenesis, invasion, altered metabolism, and resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. Hypoxic tumor regions are also known to select for aggressive cancer phenotypes with the highest capacity for metastatic spread. We have identified significantly changed molecular signatures in hypoxic tumor regions in human breast tumor xenograft models, with confirmed lists and networks of metabolites, lipids, and proteins that are significantly altered. We propose to now build on these studies by developing fast reproducible clinical sample preparation and mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) protocols that allow for high throughput use in clinical pathology laboratories and seamlessly integrate with histology and immunohistochemistry. We will test in large cohorts of human breast cancer tissue samples if hypoxic metabolome, lipidome, and proteome signatures have prognostic clinical value. To this end, we will employ innovative multi-enzyme on-tissue digestion for proteins and glycans, reactive desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) for enhanced metabolic marker discovery, and MSI-based Ozonolysis (OzID) for on-the-fly lipid isomer imaging. In Aim 2, we will use these MSI approaches for analyzing tissue microarrays with biopsies from the primary tumors of over 1,000 breast cancer patients to test if hypoxic molecular signatures can predict patient outcome, recurrence, and 5-year-survival. In Aim 3, we will address the most life-threatening aspect of breast cancer, the formation of metastases, and investigate if hypoxic regions in primary human breast tumors are driving the development of metastases. The proposed research will identify key molecular networks through which hypoxia drives breast cancers towards worse outcome and metastasis. Recent developments in MSI have significantly improved its imaging speed, making it now possible to perform MSI-based molecular pathology in clinically relevant times. This enables us to translate the results of our earlier studies on the effect of hypoxia in the breast TME directly to large patient cohorts. We will clinically evaluate matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) MSI as diagnostic tool in conjunction with the routine clinical pathology workup for accurate molecular prognosis of breast cancers. The large-scale metabolite and lipid signatures obtained in our application will support the emerging use of ambient ionization MSI applications for accurate intraoperative margin detection during breast-conserving surgery and intraoperative diagnostics using the iKnife."
"9357374","Project Summary Kidney stones are common and costly. They are associated with severe pain, and increased rates of chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and coronary heart disease. Despite this importance, there is much that is not known about stone risk factors and preventative options are limited. We propose to study two novel factors, circadian rhythm disruption and bisphosphonate medications, and the association with kidney stone formation within the Nurses? Health Study II cohort. Disruptions in circadian rhythm, as in night shift work, may be a modifiable risk factor for kidney stones because of the known diurnal variation in kidney function and kidney stone risk, association between a melatonin receptor and recurrent kidney stones, and the possible lowering effect of melatonin on urinary calcium. Higher urinary calcium levels are associated with increased risk of kidney stones. Bisphosphonate medications may also reduce urinary calcium; if they also reduce kidney stone risk, this could be a new preventative option for patients with calcium-containing kidney stones. In Aim 1, we will examine the association between shift work and kidney stone formation. We hypothesize that night shift work will be associated with higher risk of kidney stone formation. In Aim 2, we will study bisphosphonate use and risk of kidney stones. We will also do a cross-sectional analysis using urine samples to compare mean urinary calcium levels between participants using and not using bisphosphonates. We hypothesize that bisphosphonate use will be associated with lower risk of kidney stone formation and lower mean urinary calcium excretion. Characterizing additional risk factors and identifying novel treatments will contribute to understanding of kidney stone formation and provide additional preventative strategies for patients and providers."
"9385900","K23 Abstract A Patient-Centered Asthma Management Communication Intervention  for Rural Latino Children DESCRIPTION: Rural Latino children with asthma suffer high rates of uncontrolled asthma symptoms, emergency department visits, and repeat hospitalizations. This vulnerable population must negotiate micro and macro level challenges that impact asthma management, including language barriers, primary care access, parental time off from work, insurance coverage, distance from specialty sites, and documentation status. There are few proven interventions that address asthma management embedded within this unique context. Using a bio-ecological approach, we will determine the feasibility of a patient-centered collaborative program between rural Latino children with asthma and their families, school based nursing, and primary care providers, facilitated by the use of a smart phone based mobile application (mobile app) with a Spanish-language interface. We hypothesize that improving communication through a collaborative, patient-centered intervention will improve asthma management, empower the patient and family, decrease outcome disparities, and decrease direct and indirect costs. The specific aims of this study include: 1) Produce and validate a Spanish translation of an existing asthma management app and evaluate its usability with Latino parents of children with asthma; 2) Develop and evaluate a triadic, patient-centered asthma intervention preliminary protocol, facilitated by the bilingual mobile app validated in aim 1; and 3) Investigate the feasibility of the patient-centered asthma intervention from aim 2 using a wait list randomized control trial (RCT) to investigate the effects of the intervention on school days missed and medication adherence. The results of this study will be used to support a full scale randomized control trial R01 grant application in Year 4 of this award. The career development award will provide Dr. Estrada the mentoring and training needed to develop knowledge and skills in rural asthma disparities research, intervention development and program evaluation, and integration of technology- based interventions. At the close of the award, she will be positioned to design, implement, and evaluate research that will significantly impact rural asthma disparities."
"9395840","Background: Although dysregulation of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is oncogenic in several ectodermal tumors, its contributions to breast cancer have not been thoroughly explored. Our unpublished data show a significant correlation between a Hh pathway-active signature of gene expression and poor prognosis across all breast cancer subtypes. Preliminary data in a mouse model of metastatic breast cancer (MMTV-PyMT) suggest that Hh pathway activity mediated by the Gli2 transcriptional effector has opposite effects on disease progression when active in tumor epithelium as compared to tumor-associated stroma. In CK14+ tumor epithelial cells, Gli2 may enhance late-stage growth and metastasis, whereas Gli2 in the stroma may restrain initial tumor growth by promoting expression of BMP ligands. The timing, regulation, and mechanistic basis of these effects thus must be rigorously examined prior to use of Gli2-targeted therapies. These studies will illuminate the correlation between Hh pathway activity and poor prognosis, and the reduced risk of breast cancer mortality in a Chilean population subjected to high intake of arsenic, a Gli2 antagonist. Objective/Hypothesis: This proposal hypothesizes that Gli2 activity in the tumor epithelium promotes breast cancer progression while Gli2 activity in the stroma restrains tumor growth and is lost during disease progression. Simultaneously modulating these opposing Gli2 contributions using FDA-approved compounds will have therapeutic benefit. Specific Aims: 1) To determine if epithelial Gli2 is required for MMTV-PyMT tumor progression. 2) To determine whether Gli2 in the mammary stroma restrains MMTV-PyMT tumor progression. 3) To determine whether simultaneous inhibition of Gli2 in the tumor epithelium and restoration of BMP signaling provides therapeutic benefit. Study Design: Using conditional genetics to enable temporal and cell type-specific manipulation of Gli2, this study will establish the role of Gli2 in breast cancer epithelial and stromal cells using the MMTV-PyMT mouse model of metastatic breast cancer. This will enable careful characterization of the role of Gli2 at each stage of progression. Tumor growth, metastatic load, and histology will be analyzed in each experiment. The regulatory and mechanistic basis for the effects of Gli2 in the epithelium and stroma will be characterized using organoid culture and pharmacology. To circumvent the difficulty of therapeutic modulation of opposing Gli2 contributions to tumor progression in epithelium and stroma, mice will be treated with arsenic trioxide (ATO) to block Gli2 activity in epithelium, and the BMP agonist FK506 to mimic the effect of Hh pathway activity in stroma."
"9283077","Project 3 Summary This project will develop a combinatorial therapy that enhances high-frequency irreversible electroporation (H- FIRE) focal ablation with targeting agents to selectively target tumor cells which infiltrate beyond the tumor margin, a current challenge to successfully treating glioblastoma (GBM). H-FIRE is a new, minimally invasive ablation technique that involves delivering a series of low energy (intense, but short) bursts of electric pulses to targeted tissue for approximately 5 minutes. These pulses destabilize the cell membranes of the targeted tissue, inducing cell death without causing thermal damage. H-FIRE creates complete and predictable cell ablation with sharp transition between normal and necrotic tissue. Furthermore, H-FIRE only affects a single component of the treated volume, the cell membrane, and preserves important tissue components such as scaffolds, myelin sheaths, blood vessels, connective tissue, and nerves. We hypothesize that infiltrative cells (beyond the H-FIRE ablated zone) can be selectively killed using a low dose of a targeted anti-GBM agent in combination with H-FIRE, resulting in complete regression of tumors while preventing further infiltration beyond the treatment margins. For tumor cells outside the zone of direct tissue ablation, there is a non-destructive increase in blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, making these cells more susceptible to the administered agents and thus, making the combination of IRE and adjuvant agents synergistic. By focusing on brain cancer, we will be directly addressing the need to develop alternative approaches to radiation and chemotherapy, both of which have adverse side effects and limited efficacy. This Project 3 of our P01 proposal has three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will characterize the electrical properties of brain tumor tissues in response to H-FIRE pulses at both the cellular and tissue scales, using a combination of engineered 3D tumor models, as well as excised healthy (canine) and malignant (human, canine) brain tissue. We will also characterize cellular responses to H-FIRE in combination with QUAD-CTX/Pep-1-L-CTX from Project 1 of this P01. The data collected from this study will help accurately predict treatment volume for future H-FIRE treatments. In Aim 2, we will quantify the effects of H-FIRE treatment in rats to assess BBB breakdown in vivo. In Aim 3, we will assess QUAD-CTX/Pep-1-L-CTX coupled with H-FIRE to treat spontaneous brain tumors in canine patients. If successful, this study will provide the foundation for a new form of cancer therapy capable of improving conventional treatments for both tumors and the infiltrative GBM cells beyond the tumor margin to eliminate the likelihood of tumor recurrence, while preserving the vital healthy surrounding tissue."
"9358706","The effects of drinking alcohol within recommended limits on risks of CVD, diabetes, and related diseases are perhaps the most important questions yet to be answered in the fields of alcohol, nutrition, or prevention. Approximately half of all adults worldwide report current or former alcohol consumption, and the benefits or risks that alcohol poses to their health urgently need clarification. Epidemiological studies have consistently found that alcohol intake within recommended limits is associated with lower risk of coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and diabetes, yet no long-term randomized trial of alcohol consumption on risk of any chronic disease has yet been performed. In direct response to PAR-16-363 (Multi-Site Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial Research Center on Alcohol's Health Effects), we propose a worldwide, six-year, balanced-design randomized trial, comparing the effects of one standard serving (~14 grams) of alcohol intake daily to abstention on risk of CVD, diabetes, mortality, and related outcomes among 7,800 adults at above-average cardiovascular risk worldwide. To maximize feasibility and reflect actual use most closely, we propose to test alcohol consumption per se to abstention and thus to offer participants flexibility in their choice of beverage, while employing novel and intensive yet efficient methods to monitor safety. The Primary Specific Aim of this trial is to determine the effects of 14 gm of alcohol intake daily compared with abstention on risk of major cardiovascular events or death (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hospitalized angina, need for revascularization, or death) over an average of 6 years of follow-up among 7,800 adults aged ?50 years with estimated 10-year CVD risk ?15% or prevalent CVD >6 months prior to enrollment. Secondary Aims will test the effects of alcohol on risks of incident diabetes and major cardiovascular events. Tertiary Aims will test risks of hard cardiovascular events and progression to impaired fasting glucose. Similar to other large randomized trials, we will establish ~16 centers worldwide using a stepped approach, with a 9-month vanguard phase among 7 centers in the US, Europe, Africa, and South America (in this application), followed by a second wave of additional sites to complete enrollment. Participants will be monitored for safety in multiple complementary ways, including brief electronic real-time reporting and validated yearly instruments and laboratory measures. We have brought together highly successful groups in the US and Europe to establish clinical, data, and biospecimen coordinating centers, our field centers include many of the most experienced clinical trialists anywhere, and our group has strong working relationships with NIAAA and other NIH staff necessary to ensure seamless collaboration during a U10-funded cooperative research endeavor. In this application, we propose the first randomized clinical trial of alcohol consumption, aiming to determine whether it increases or decreases the risk of CVD and diabetes among adults at above-average cardiovascular risk worldwide."
"9429528","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A gradual decline in renal function occurs in healthy aging individuals. Aging may exacerbate Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) and Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). About more than half of the CKD cases and majority of the end stage renal disease (ESRD) occur in the older population. These findings highlight the importance of kidney aging and its potential contribution to AKI, CKD and ESRD in the elderly. Since the population older than 65 years in the United States is expected to double during the next 20 years, focus on potential early intervention strategies for age-associated renal injury and disease becomes critical. We will test the hypothesis that the age-related decreases in nuclear hormone receptor FXR and G protein coupled membrane receptor TGR5 expression play an important role in age-related kidney disease by impairing mitochondrial function, which results in a) increased generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased generation of mitochondrial antioxidants, causing increased oxidative stress and inflammation, and b) decreased mitochondrial fatty acid ß-oxidation, causing increased renal lipid accumulation. We propose that FXR and/or TGR5 agonists or overexpression will prevent or markedly reduce age-related decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), increase in albuminuria, podocyte loss, and accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins (fibrosis) by improving mitochondrial function, which results in a) decreased generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased generation of mitochondrial antioxidants, causing decreased oxidative stress and inflammation, and b) increased mitochondrial fatty acid ß-oxidation, causing decreased renal lipid accumulation. In SPECIFIC AIM 1, we will determine the role of FXR and TGR5 in progression of age-related renal disease. We will also perform mechanistic studies to determine how alterations in kidney bile acid composition regulate podocyte function. In SPECIFIC AIM 2, we will perform mechanistic studies to determine if FXR and TGR5 protect against age-related renal disease by Sirtuin 3 dependent mechanisms. Impact and Innovation: 1) The hitherto unrecognized roles of: i) nuclear receptor FXR, ii) G protein coupled receptor TGR5 and iii) the potential of dual FXR/TGR5 agonists as therapeutic agents for treating age- associated renal disease and complications. 2) The novel and distinct role of FXR and TGR5 agonists in regulation of mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, inflammation, and lipid metabolism, as they relate to age- associated renal conditions. 3) TGR5/FXR signaling mimics that of caloric restriction (CR), potentially leading to new intervention strategies for age-related kidney injury and complications. 4) Mechanistic studies to determine the roles of the bile acids and mitochondrial Sirtuin 3 in modulation of age-related renal disease."
"9355463","Project Summary The overall objective of this project is to evaluate the potential of novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and localized 31phosphorus-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS) measures of bioenergetics and microvascular function to monitor disease progression and treatment in dystrophic muscle. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is characterized by progressive muscle weakness, deteriorating functional capabilities, loss of independence, and early death. Muscles in children with DMD are deficient in dystrophin, which is accompanied by a lack of sarcolemma-localized neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). Although there is no cure for DMD, a number of promising therapies are being developed and evaluated, and young boys are predominantly being targeted as subjects. However, reliable markers of disease progression are lacking, particularly in young boys. Recent studies have shown considerable promise in muscle energetic status measured with 31P-MRS as an early marker of pathology in dystrophic muscle. The cause of these energetic disturbances (e.g., reduced phosphocreatine) is poorly understood, as well as the response to disease progression and treatment. The lack of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in dystrophic muscle has been attributed to cause reduced blood flow during and following skeletal muscle contractions in DMD, and may also contribute to the reported energetic perturbations and increased susceptibility to damage in dystrophic muscle. In aim 1 we will use a murine model (mdx) to provide insight into the relationship between energetic status and microvascular function in dystrophy using high resolution MR. In aim 2, we will establish the effects of treatment with an established AAV-microdystrophin vector with and without the nNOS binding domain. Finally, in aim 3, we will apply these methods to the lower extremity of boys with DMD and unaffected controls in a range of ages using a cross sectional design. MR measures will evaluate 1) heterogeneity of energetic status among muscles using 31P 2D chemical shift imaging and 2) microvascular function using MRI blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) contrast and arterial spin labeling (ASL). Furthermore, we will test the day-to-day variability of these measures in DMD and controls. The overall hypothesis of this project is that localized MR measures of bioenergetics and microvascular function will enable early detection of disease pathology at a young age, will be responsive to disease progression, and will be effective in monitoring improvements with treatment in dystrophic muscle. We anticipate that the results will lead to reproducible methods that can be implemented to evaluate potential treatments targeted at DMD and other neuromuscular diseases."
"9328114","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco smoke has a devastating impact on health. Despite evidence that tobacco harms lungs and other organs, >20% of the U.S. population continue to smoke regularly. Tobacco smoke causes COPD and lung cancer. Long term tobacco exposure triggers an inflammatory response in the lung that contributes to the pathogenesis of COPD. Moreover, COPD is a common and important independent risk factor for lung cancer and thus, COPD may be thought of as a pre-cancerous state. More specifically, tobacco smoke causes airway surface liquid/mucus dehydration and increased incidence of viral infections, suggesting that the Lung's Innate Defense System has been impaired. These changes are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of COPD. In response to new legislation aimed at curbing the sale of cigarettes, the tobacco industry has developed tobacco alternatives that seek to evade this legislation. Usage of little cigars which are often flavored and are thus  attractive to younger smokers, has risen 240%, while in NC, up to 50% of college students claim to have tried Hookah, with >10% being regular Hookah smokers. Whilst many of these tobacco alternatives are perceived to be safer, their impact on lung health is unknown. Thus, we propose to measure the potential adverse impact of tobacco alternatives on the lung's innate defense system. Projects I and II (Tarran and Kesimer) are focused on determining the impact of tobacco alternatives on specific aspects of this system, namely, airway surface liquid homeostasis and mucin/mucus and will use an innovative in vitro smoke exposure system to measure specific biomarkers of innate lung defense as well as obtain airway samples from smokers of alternate tobacco. In Project III (Doerschuk), we propose to develop a novel animal model of smoke exposure that more closely mimics the chronic bronchitis phenotype seen in humans with COPD. This model will be used to validate tobacco exposure biomarkers seen in Projects I and II as well as to determine epigenetic changes following in vivo exposure to alternative tobacco. Project IV (Jaspers) will determine genomic biomarkers associated with tobacco alternatives from samples obtained from human volunteers. Focusing on changes in antiviral host defense in these subjects, this model will be used to integrate observations made in the other projects with findings obtained from humans infected with live attenuated influenza virus. Thus, using human and mouse in vivo and in vitro models, this project will identify novel biomarkers associated with tobacco-induced changes in lung innate defense, which can be applied to understand potential toxicity of any new and emerging tobacco products.           RELEVANCE: Tobacco exposure impairs multiple arms of the lung's innate defense system including mucus clearance (i.e., the lung's ability to clean itself) and resistance to inhaled pathogens such as viruses. These changes are contributory to the development of COPD. The potential impact of new and emerging tobacco products on the lung's innate defense system is totally unknown. We propose to describe the effects of such tobacco alternatives on lung health using in vitro and in vivo model systems as well as obtaining biomarker samples from smokers of tobacco alternatives such as Hookah and Little Cigars. Such knowledge may help dispel the myth that new tobacco products represent a safer alternative to cigarettes."
"9360118","Abstract The overarching goal of this proposal is to learn how large groups of neurons interact in a network to perform computations that go beyond the individual ability of each cell. Our working hypothesis is that emergent behavior in neural networks results from their organization into a hierarchy of modular sub-networks or motifs, each performing simpler computations than the network as a whole. This theoretical framework suggests that our understanding of neural networks will advance if we can reliably measure network connectivity, detect recurring motifs, elucidate the computations they perform, and reveal how these smaller modules are combined into larger networks capable of performing increasingly complex computations. To advance the field forward we will: (a) develop novel system identification methods for cortical networks based on dynamical, two- photon imaging data. Our methods will use a Bayesian formulation that incorporates prior constraints on network topology, sparsity of synaptic connections, and cell type, derived from published, experimental data; (b) advance graph theoretic methods to identify patterns of connectivity among subsets of neurons which appear at rates higher than chance; (c) will use extensive in-vivo and in-vitro methods to validate our techniques. The work will deliver transformative software tools for Bayesian inference of network connectivity from functional data; it will yield a catalog of elementary cortical motifs of excitatory and inhibitory cells that will shed light on the wiring of the cortical circuitry; and it will generate the first database combining functional calcium imaging data with ?ground truth? estimates of direct synaptic connectivity. Altogether, the proposed work will make available much needed analytical tools and databases to support a wide range of studies under the BRAIN initiative."
"9319178","The Robert H. Lurie Cancer Center (Lurie Cancer Center) has developed a comprehensive system of protocol review and oversight called the Clinical Protocol Scientific Review and Monitoring System (CPSRMS). This system is comprised of three distinct committees that work collaboratively to provide oversight of all aspects of clinical research conducted at the Lurie Cancer Center. These committees include: the Scientific Review Committee (SRC), the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), and the Clinical Trial Audit Committee (CTAC). Each committee includes a Chair and/or Co-chair, but the CPSRMS overall is directed by the Associate Director for Clinical Investigations ofthe Lurie Cancer Center, Dr. Al B. Benson. This position is appointed by and reports to Dr. Steven Rosen, the Director ofthe Lurie Cancer Center. The three committees work in conjunction to form a robust system designed to ensure that research conducted at our center has scientific merit and meets the goals and priorities of the center, that clinical trial progress is maintained, and that patient safety and data integrity are maintained for our Northwestern University investigator-initiated trials (NU IITs).        The CPSRMS committee responsible for Protocol Review and Monitoring (PRMS) is the SRC. The SRC is charged with the responsibility of evaluating all new and ongoing clinical research protocols for scientific merit, institutional priority and ongoing progress. The committee is a multidisciplinary committee that meets bimonthly to evaluate protocols. All cancer-relevant research studies conducted within the Lurie Cancer Center fall under the purview of this committee and require a level of review. Any faculty member within NU and all Lurie Cancer Center members are required to submit cancer-relevant clinical research protocols to the SRC for review. Protocols are classified into four types: institutional, external peer-reviewed, national/cooperative group, and industrial trials. The different types of protocols undergo different levels of review by the SRC. Any study that is reviewed and approved by an NCI approved peer-review committee (national trials and external peer-reviewed) is exempt from initial and ongoing SRC review for scientific merit. These studies are reviewed administratively for prioritization, and are reviewed annually for progress. All other studies (institutional and industrial) require initial and ongoing SRC review for scientific merit, and also are reviewed for prioritization and progress. Importantly, the NU Institutional Review Board (IRB) requires Lurie Cancer Center endorsement for all cancer-relevant protocols prior to IRB review, therefore ensuring the SRC review requirements have been appropriately met. The administrative support for SRC is coordinated through the Clinical Research Office (CRO)."
"9321916","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Muscle stem cells, also called Satellite Cells (SC) function to maintain tissue homeostasis and regenerate skeletal muscle. In the adult, the SCs are maintained in a quiescent state both by intrinsic mechanisms and extrinsic signals from the niche. The quiescent nature of stem cells preserves the stem cell pool from premature exhaustion. One fundamental question is: how is the identity of the quiescent stem cells established and maintained during the life of an organism? And how the niche contributes to maintaining this identity? The notch signaling pathway is a major regulator of stem cell quiescence. In this proposal we aim to 1) identify the cell source and the specific Notch ligands that maintain SC quiescence and 2) how Notch signaling changes in the activated SCs. We will delete Mindbomb1, an enzyme that activates Notch ligands, specifically in the muscle fiber to determine the role of Notch ligands under homeostatic conditions and their impact on the ability of SCs to function under a regenerative response in vivo. We will also delete Dll4, a Notch ligand in the muscle fiber as preliminary data suggests that Dll4 expression increases in the muscle fiber during postnatal maturation which correlates with the appearance of quiescent SCs. Preliminary data also shows that activated SCs on an intact muscle fiber accumulate Dll4 in their cytoplasm; which is lost in the absence of muscle fibers. This suggests that muscle fiber is required for the increase in Dll4 protein in activated SC. We will assay the activated SC's on muscle fibers for Notch targets to see if there is a decrease in Notch signaling and will perform loss and gain-of-function for Dll4 in the activated SCs to see if Notch signaling is affected. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1) To determine the role of Notch ligands in the muscle fiber to maintain SC quiescence, 2) To determine if Dll4 is the critical mediator of Notch signaling that maintains SC quiescence and 3) To determine the functional role of Dll4 in activated satellite cell daughters. Successful completion of this project will provide molecular insights into the regulation of SC quiescence by the Notch ligands in the niche acting in a non-cell autonomous manner and how this transitions to cell-autonomous signaling in activated SCs."
"9329497","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recurrent concussions are a major concern at every competitive level of contact sports. The long-term effects of concussion are poorly understood and need further investigation. The results of recent studies indicate that retired athletes with history of multiple concussions are at increased risk for depression, cognitive impairment, early onset Alzheimer's disease, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The proposed study aims will elucidate the relationship between repetitive head trauma and early cognitive decline, a possible prodrome of CTE. In Aim 1, we propose to identify cases of mild cognitive impairment in a cohort of retired professional football players with history of multiple concussions and compare the severity and nature of clinical impairment to a cohort of mild cognitively impaired, matched controls without concussion history. Based on many previous studies and our own preliminary data, we predict that the retired athletes will have similar cognitive impairments, but worse neuropsychiatric symptomatology. We hypothesize that these symptoms are mediated by fronto-limbic dysfunction. Accordingly, Aim 2 entails functional neuroimaging to assess connectivity within the fronto-limbic emotional processing network. We will utilize a task paradigm that places a high cognitive load on this network to compare functional connectivity between the retired athletes and controls. We predict athletes will have altered fronto-limbic functional connectivity relative to controls. Overall, this project will provide critical insight ito the role of repetitive head trauma on cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disease. Furthermore, it will advance clinical practice by characterizing the presentation of early cognitiv decline secondary to head trauma and probing underlying neural network dysfunctions related to this unique decline. This information could be used to improve screening, prognosis, and patient counseling and may even provide a surrogate marker (fronto-limbic connectivity) for treatment efficacy in clinical trials in this population."
"9537160","Overall - Project Summary/Abstract: The contamination of water and aquifer sediments with arsenic (As) is associated with major public health and environmental mitigation issues in the United States. At present, 823 of 1739 U.S. Superfund sites list As as a major contaminant; in addition millions of U.S. residents are unduly exposed due to naturally occurring As in their household well water. This proposal includes two biomedical and two geoscience projects that seek to address critically important issues that collectively aim to reduce As exposure and toxicity in exposed human populations in the U.S. and in Bangladesh, where much information can be learned that will benefit residents of the U.S. and elsewhere. The proposal builds on the strengths of our existing longitudinal cohort study of 35,000 adults in Bangladesh by examining dose-response relationships between As exposure (in the low-mid range) from contaminated food and water with incident cases (and sub-types) of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and non-malignant lung disease, as well as diabetes mellitus (DM). In addition, we will combine and meta-analyze data from Bangladesh, Taiwan, China (Inner Mongolia) and the U.S. (AZ, CO, ND, OK, SD) to refine the dose-response relationships between As exposure and CVD. We build off our previous observations that: a) As exposure is associated with deficits in child intelligence; and b) that folate, a B vitamin, facilitates As metabolism and elimination in adults. We propose to conduct a randomized clinical trial in 8-10 year old children in Bangladesh to test the hypothesis that folate+B12 supplementation can: a) lower blood As; and b) improve cognitive abilities in children.  Building on our previous geoscience research which indicates that in situ magnetite formation forms a diffuse barrier capable of long-term As retention, we propose to conduct laboratory and field research to optimize and implement this new approach at a U.S. Geological Survey research site on Cape Cod, MA and a Superfund site in Raleigh, NC. In Bangladesh, we will quantify the geographic and socio-political barriers to reducing As exposure by analyzing the vast data sets accumulated in our main study area and we will conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing ways to overcome some of them. In parallel, we will continue to examine the potential vulnerability to human perturbations of shallow and deep aquifers that are low in As. These low As aquifers are crucial for reducing exposure to our study population and the country at large.  In the U.S., we will build on our proven success of partnering with state and local governments to reduce As exposure in communities that rely on As-contaminated household wells in ME, NJ and MN. We will also continue to facilitate effective communication among our SRP scientists, stakeholders and government partners via five specific strategies. Finally, we will continue to train the next generation of scientists with disciplinary and inter-disciplinary skills that will enable them to improve the health of those who reside in environments that might expose them to As and other contaminants in soil, water and food. "
"9383412","Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in exon 1 of the Huntingtin (HTT) gene. There are no effective treatments for this fatal disease. Thus, identification of new target pathways to mitigate Huntington's disease is critical. We discovered two targets that lower mutant HTT protein (mHTT) and thus hold potential for disease-modifying therapy. In an unbiased, high-throughput screen, we discovered PIP4K?-INH, an allosteric inhibitor of PIP4K?. Treatment of HdhQ111 knock-in mouse striatal neurons with PIP4K?-INH, reduced the levels of HTTQ111. Moreover, exposure of Huntington patient fibroblasts to inhibition or knock-down of PIP4K?, reduced mutant huntingtin protein. PIP4K? converts PI5P to PI(4,5)P2. We determined which phosphoinositide lipids are impacted by PIP4K?-INH, and identified an orthogonal approach to induce similar changes in these lipids. Notably this new approach might also lower mutant HTT aggregates. Indeed, co-expression of huntingtin exon1-polyQ74-GFP (httQ74-GFP) combined with activation of a lipid kinase reduced httQ74 aggregates by >35%. Thus, orthogonal approaches that change phosphoinositide lipids have the potential to lower HD levels. The overall goal of this proposal is to determine whether inhibition of PIP4K? and/or activation of a lipid kinase should be test for the potential to ameliorate phenotypes associated with HD. This goal will be pursued with the following aims: 1) Determine the effects of activation of a specific lipid kinase on cellular levels of mutant HTT. 2) Determine mechanisms whereby inhibition of PIP4K? or activation of a specific lipid kinase lowers mutant HTT. 3) Determine whether inhibition of PIP4K? and/or activation of a specific lipid kinase mitigates disease pathogenesis in animal models of HD. We predict that the outcomes of these studies will reveal that one or both lipid kinase targets are attractive options for further testing as possible disease-modifying agents in preclinical studies."
"9478470","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent research focused on the genetics of aging suggests that biological aging is partially under epigenetic control and that deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation profiles may be an index of the epigenetic clock that is important for regulating cellular aging (e.g., Horvath, 2013). Methylation influences developmental processes and is critical for cell differentiation and adaptation to the environment; it regulates the expression of the gene by suppressing or activating gene transcription (Szyf, 2013). Several investigators have developed algorithms to use methylation profiling to index cellular age (Hannum et al., 2013; Horvath, 2013; Weidner et al., 2014). This discovery paves the way for research into the factors that may alter the rate of biological aging. This project will use multivariate data analyses to evaluate if trauma exposure and traumatic stress, as defined by posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity, are associated with accelerated cellular aging using DNA methylation age as the index of cellular age. Analyses will also test if DNA methylation age mediates the association between traumatic stress and metabolic syndrome, an age-related physical health problem that has been shown to co-occur with PTSD (Bartoli et al., 2013). Additional analyses would further explore the hypothesized association between traumatic stress and DNA methylation age to evaluate if this is driven by specific biological pathways and genetic variants implicated in cellular aging. This will be accomplished using existing data drawn from two U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs samples that can be combined as a result of their shared methodologies, yielding a total sample size of 685 white, non-Hispanic participants. The first sample comprises U.S. military veterans who served in Operation Enduring or Iraqi Freedom and the second sample consists of trauma- exposed U.S. military veterans and a subset of their trauma-exposed spouses. Both samples completed structured psychiatric diagnostic interviews and provided blood samples for DNA extraction. Information on genome-wide and epigenome-wide variation was assessed on the Illumina OMNI 2.5 million and Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays, respectively. This project may help to characterize the adverse environmental factors that are associated with the rate of cellular aging in the methylome and to discover new molecular pathways of traumatic-stress related disease. This will help to identify those individuals at greatest risk for accelerated agin and its negative health consequences. This is a necessary first step before risk factors can be modified with the ultimate aim of improving health."
"9385561","ABSTRACT _____ ________________________ ______________ _____ _  Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder with several neurological and developmental complications. While there has been progress in terms of screening and treatment of neurological complications, particularly in terms of overt ischemic stroke and silent cerebral infarct, children with SCD still have worsening cognition over time in the absence of obvious brain injury. Children with SCD and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and no prior history of stroke or silent cerebral infarct, defined as cryptogenic ADHD, represent an understudied yet important subset of this vulnerable population. We hypothesize that cryptogenic ADHD is associated with white matter injury and plasma biomarkers associated with brain injury. We will explore this hypothesis through the following Specific Aims. Aim 1: Identify clinical risk factors of cryptogenic ADHD in SCD. Through a retrospective chart review of patients from pediatric SCD neurodevelopmental and hematology clinics, we will compare the clinical characteristics of children with SCD and cryptogenic ADHD to children with SCD and no prior history of stroke, silent cerebral infarct, or ADHD and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Aim 2: Establish associations between cryptogenic ADHD and white matter brain injury. We will recruit 20 children 8 to 12 years of age with SCD and cryptogenic ADHD and 20 children with SCD without a prior history of stroke, silent cerebral infarct, or ADHD and other neurodevelopmental disorders to participate in a case control study. Subjects will undergo neurodevelopmental and neuropsychological evaluations, neuroimaging protocols including DTI, arterial spin labeling, oxygen extraction fraction, and volumetric imaging, and blood sample draw. Aim 3: Establish associations between cryptogenic ADHD and plasma biomarkers. Using the blood samples from the group of research subjects in Aim 2, we will measure the levels of various neuronal and glial protein markers to identify potential plasma biomarker proteins of neurological injury. We will compare the protein levels to DTI findings as well as neuropsychological measures.  The proposed work will define a clinical and neuroimaging phenotype of children with SCD and cryptogenic ADHD, establishing this population as part of the spectrum of brain injury seen in pediatric SCD. The Principal Investigator will require additional training in the hematological management of SCD and neuroimaging acquisition and analysis techniques to complete the proposed projects. Future research will involve use of DTI as a measure of disease severity, predict cognitive outcomes, and monitor response to treatment in clinical trials research and longitudinal assessment of the research group established in Aim 2 to establish their risk of future neurological complications."

"9382800","PROJECT SUMMARY We propose to refine and exploit powerful new markers and labeling systems to visualize multiple proteins or other biomolecules by electron microscopy (EM), correlated with light microscopy (LM). EM is one of the most powerful techniques to see cell structures below optical resolution, but has suffered from lack of generally applicable genetically encoded labels until our recent development of new EM-compatible markers such as miniSOG, a small flavoprotein that will do for EM what Green Fluorescent Protein did for LM, and APEX, an engineered ascorbate peroxidase. We have developed split-miniSOG, two fragments that do nothing separately, but when brought back together reversibly regenerate miniSOG and its fluorescence and photooxidative capability. Our newly developed split-miniSOG complementation system allows us to visualize intermolecular interactions at high resolution by EM.  We have developed new strategies and techniques to improve the acquisition of element-specific analytical maps in transmission EM to achieve what we refer to as multicolor EM. This technology allows distinct EM- level labeling of multiple species with a different lanthanide element that is separately imaged by electron energy-loss spectrometry (EELS) and displayed in a distinct pseudocolor. Just as multicolor fluorescence has been vital to understanding many cellular functions at optical resolution, we anticipate multicolor EM will be valuable at finer resolution.  Our overall goals are to expand and improve EM-compatible reporters, `molecular painting' chemistry, and new instrumentation to improve the resolution, sensitivity, and specificity with which multiple proteins or other biomolecules can be imaged by EM. We aim to obtain a genetically encoded far-red or near-infrared diaminobenzidine (DAB) photooxidizer analogous to miniSOG but excited at significantly longer wavelengths to facilitate multispecies labeling at high resolution. We will develop controlled living polymerization as an alternative to photooxidative amplification using modern methods such as ATRP, ROMP, or RAFT applied to fixed cells and tissue, to generate lanthanide-containing polymers of defined length and morphology at desired cellular targets. As test cases, these techniques will be applied to fundamental biological problems such as the spatial organization of the genome in the nucleus and aggregation of specified proteins involved in neurodegenerative diseases. We have chosen these biological processes because they are diverse, engage outstanding collaborators, and have great biomedical importance.  Ultimately, the combination of photooxidizing, peroxidase-based, and nonphotochemical amplifying systems will give cell and molecular biologists a rich palette for EM, comparable to small-molecule fluorophores plus fluorescent proteins for optical microscopy."

"9232682","Abstract Summary Over the last 50 years esophageal cancer diagnosis in the United States has switched from squamous cell to predominantly adenocarcinomas affecting the upper esophagus. Early treatment is key to better outcomes and recent advances in minimally invasive endoscopic techniques have enabled removal of larger lesions. However, the diameter of the upper esophagus is smaller and these large lesions ? typically >30 mm in length or >75 % of circumference ? are prone to scarring that leads to stricture. Patients who develop stricture are typically treated with endoscopic dilation similar to angioplasty and may require multiple dilations. Our long-term goal is to prevent stricture by combing antiproliferative drug delivery with an esophageal stent already used clinically after procedures for the removal of cancerous or precancerous tissue. The central hypothesis is that slow, steady delivery of antiproliferative drug sirolimus will inhibit fibroblast proliferation and scarring, the main culprit behind stricture, but without the cytotoxicity we observed from similar delivery of mitomycin C in our pig model, and over a therapeutic timeframe relevant to cellular remodeling (4-6 weeks). This Proof-of- Principle for this next work will be accomplished in two aims: 1.) Formulation and characterization of sirolimus-loaded stent coatings using our affinity-based delivery platform; and 2.) In vitro validation of the anti-proliferative effect of delivered sirolimus using porcine smooth muscle and esophageal epithelial cells. Our proposed work is innovative; it represents the first therapy capable of sustained, local drug delivery for preventing esophageal stricture. We use a novel approach to achieve high loading and long-term, sustained release of therapeutics well beyond that capable of other, diffusion- only systems studied. The expected outcomes include development of coated stent capable of releasing drug for 4-6 weeks that inhibits cell proliferation and migration without overt cytotoxicity. These results will positively impact the field of endoscopic surgery by decreasing painful and expensive complications resulting from removal of large cancerous or precancerous esophageal lesions. Future work will translate these R03 proof-of-principle studies to our porcine in vivo model to validate long-term prevention of esophageal stricture. In addition, we continue to work with our endoscopic surgical collaborators to bring this stricture-preventing therapy closer to a clinical reality."
"9490942","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed study will address a novel function of Copper (Cu)-transporting ATPase (ATP7A), a Cu transporter for extracellular SOD (ecSOD), in preventing endothelial dysfunction and eNOS uncoupling in diabetes. Oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction contribute to pathogenesis of diabetes melitus (DM), characterized by impaired insulin-Akt signaling. Although role of oxidative stress in vascular dysfunction in DM has been extensively studied, little is known about the function of antioxidant enzymes in these pathological diseases. ecSOD is a Cu-containing enzyme synthesized and secreted by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), and anchored to endothelial surfaces and extracellular matrix. Because of its extracellular location, ecSOD can increase nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability released from the endothelium by preventing O2?-- mediated inactivation of NO and formation of peroxynitrite (ONOO-). Our laboratory previously demonstrated that full activation of vascular ecSOD requires Cu transporter ATP7A. However, the role of ecSOD and ATP7A in vascular dysfunction in DM is entirely unknown. Based on our preliminary studies, we will test the novel hypothesis that Akt-mediated phosphorylation of ATP7A is required for increasing ATP7A stability and translocation to the caveolae/lipid rafts where ecSOD obtains Cu to increase its activity. Thus, impaired insulin-Akt signaling in DM decreases ATP7A function and ecSOD activity in VSMCs, thereby promoting overproduction of O2- and ONOO- in the extracellular space. This may facilitate the out- side in signaling leading to eNOS uncoupling and endothelial dysfunction in ECs. Aim1 will determine the molecular mechanism by which function of ATP7A, a Cu-transporting ATPase for ecSOD, is impaired in cultured diabetic VSMC. We will test the hypothesis that insulin-Akt-mediated phosphorylation of ATP7A is required for ATP7A stabilization by inhibiting its ubiquitination/degradation as well as ATP7A translocation to caveolae/lipid rafts where ecSOD obtains Cu to promote ecSOD activity in VSMCs. Aim 2 will determine the protective role of ATP7A, a Cu-transporting ATPase for ecSOD, in eNOS uncoupling and vascular dysfunction in murine and human diabetic vessels. We will examine if vessels from DM mice or those from biopsies obtained from patients with DM show decrease in ecSOD activity and ATP7A expression, thereby increasing O2- level, ONOO- level, eNOS uncoupling, and endothelial dysfunction. We will use type1 and type2 DM mice models crossed with or without ecSOD KO, ATP7A mutant, or ATP7A overexpressing transgenic mice. We will also perform rescue experiments using adenoviral gene transfer of Akt phosphorylation sites mimetic ATP7A mutant in DM vessels ex vivo. X-ray fluorescence microscopy will be used to analyze Cu distribution in DM vessels and VSMCs. These studies should provide new insight into Cu transport system for ecSOD as a novel therapeutic strategy for treatment of oxidative stress-dependent cardiovascular diseases such as diabetes."
"9377287","PROJECT SUMMARY Millions of individuals worldwide are afflicted with inflammatory diseases of the airways such as asthma that result in difficulty breathing, increased morbidity and mortality, making them significant health concerns. Currently, no cure exists for asthma, and it is one of the most expensive diseases to treat in developed countries. A hallmark of asthma is increased airway hyperreactivity and airway inflammation facilitated by specific innate and adaptive immune cells and their soluble mediators. While therapeutics targeting inflammatory soluble mediators in asthma are currently being used clinically, a more effective treatment may exist in the manipulation of immune cells to modulate their cytokine secretion during lung inflammation. Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) have recently been identified as important cellular contributors in asthma. In non-allergic asthma, which affects approximately 40% of all asthmatics, type 3 ILCs (ILC3s) rapidly expand and secrete cytokines that contribute to both the initiation (interleukin (IL)-17) and potentiation (IL-22) of airway hyperreactivity and inflammation. We postulate that select aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligands can be exploited to manipulate ILC3 cytokine secretion in airway inflammation, ultimately reducing it. Therefore, this application will test the hypothesis that different classes of AhR ligands differentially regulate receptor function to control ILC3 cytokine secretion, thereby modulating airway inflammation. Our specific Aims will specifically address this hypothesis by: 1) determining the molecular mechanisms underlying the ability of AhR ligands to manipulate ILC3 cytokine secretion, and 2) investigating the therapeutic potential of AhR ligands and AhR-activated ILC3s to modulate airway inflammation. This research is highly innovative based on the potential for different classes of AhR ligands to differentially regulate AhR function and thus manipulate cytokine secretion by ILC3s during airway inflammation. Also, we propose novel approaches to study the mechanisms by which these selective AhR ligands alter the functionality of ILC3. Furthermore, we have assembled a highly experienced and collaborative team, with expertise in mucosal immunology, airway inflammation, and AhR biology. Therefore, the proposed studies are expected to lead to new therapeutic approaches to treat chronic airway inflammatory diseases, and significantly advance our understanding of how AhR signaling regulates respiratory immunity.  "
"9428243","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a common chronic painful disorder that is the most frequent cause of mobility disability in older people. The MOST study has been a major source of new knowledge about the course of this disease and factors that affect its course. Since the study began in 2003, it is increasingly recognized that by the time people develop chronic symptoms of knee OA, they usually have advanced structural findings of disease on MRI. Findings such as meniscal tears, mal-alignment and cartilage loss drive further structural deterioration and almost certainly limit prevention opportunities. We believe that prevention opportunities are likely to be greater if started in those who do not yet have severe continuous knee pain or advanced structural findings of disease. The functional impacts of knee OA occur in older people who experience multiple musculoskeletal comorbidities, and preventing disablement from OA requires a broader perspective than a focus on a single knee. For example, those with pain in one knee are at high risk of pain in other lower extremity musculoskeletal regions and, even if the knee is replaced, they may ultimately need treatment for pain in other joints developing as a consequence of the first joint affected. Also, in additionto functional loss, persons with OA experience buckling, falls and constraints in their involvement with the outside environment. We suggest there are opportunities to develop treatments and disease prevention strategies that have been unexplored and that by using new technologies and focusing on persons at a milder or earlier disease stage than previous studies, we can identify such opportunities. We propose to recruit a new mild disease cohort and continue to study the existing MOST cohort to identify new risk factors for disease and to study consequences of disease. Our goal is to find new strategies to prevent disease at an early stage and to limit the impact of disease once it has occurred."
"9381758","Abstract. Drug resistance can be a major problem in cancer therapy. The effective treatment of resistant cancer cells can be further complicated by deficiencies that inhibit the body?s own anticancer immune response. Naturally occurring chromanones can inspire the development of drugs to better target cancer resistant cancers as they can directly destroy cancer cells while simultaneously boosting the body?s own immune response. Despite their promising activity, there is a critical barrier obstructing biological studies of chromanone-based bioactive molecules. Specifically, there are limited synthetic strategies available to access these desirable targets for biological testing. As a means to overcome this barrier, the long-term goal of our research programs is to develop chemical technologies to synthesize chromanone-based therapeutic agents for biological studies. Themes directing our investigations include: (i) developing catalytic tools to enable unique, enantioselective heterocycle synthesis; (ii) streamlining access to heterocyclic bioactive targets; and (iii) exploring the biological activities of naturally-occurring chromanones and their synthetic derivatives in the context of drug discovery. This research plan is based on the central hypothesis that silanediol-catalysis is a unique chemical technology enabling access to chromanones, and related structures, that are otherwise difficult to access. The rationale for the proposed research is that the successful development of modular and efficient routes toward chromanone-based natural products, and their derivatives, will enable biological studies of these promising medicinal agents. This approach is innovative because it uses silanediol anion-binding technology to affect pharmaceutically-attractive methodologies that are inaccessible with conventional catalysts. This contribution will be significant as it will support the development of new therapeutic agents able to fight resistant cell cancer lines through unique, dual, synergistic modes of action."

"9446017","Cognitive deficits associated with neuronal dysfunction and aging constitute a serious health problem. Dopaminergic systems contribute to a number of cognitive disorders, such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer's dementia, and Parkinson's disease, which cost > $200 billion a year in the USA alone. Successful therapeutic approaches to alleviate cognitive problems should target appropriate neural circuits in the brain. Basic neuroscience research provides that information necessary to identify the networks, neurotransmitters, and mechanisms that underlie proper brain function and are the targets for potential therapies. Proper dopaminergic signaling is essential for cognitive processes such as attention, executive function, learning, and memory. The complex nature of these processes and the paucity of synaptic and cellular data linked to the systems-level behaviors have spurred the proposed studies. Our earlier work showed that induction of in vivo synaptic plasticity associated with a learning task requires local disinhibition of excitatory circuits coupled with an afferent dopamine signal. Recent results from our lab support the view that dopamine signaling in the hippocampus lowers the threshold for synaptic plasticity that underlies learning. Our preliminary results show that local dopaminergic activity is required for in vivo hippocampal long-term synaptic potentiation associated with diverse learning paradigms, such as aversive memory retention and novel object recognition. Presently however, there is a controversy regarding the source, density, and significance of hippocampal dopaminergic innervation and about dopaminergic regulation of synaptic plasticity and memory. In the proposed studies, we will identify the sources of dopaminergic neurotransmission in the hippocampus using multiple independent viral labeling methods. Then, we will examine dopaminergic influences over distinct hippocampal circuits during specific memory tasks. Our working hypothesis is that dopamine acts within critical time windows and controls the magnitude of synaptic plasticity within specific circuits that regulate different types of learning. Dopamine normally contributes to the efficient learning of appropriate behavioral responses motivated by environmental cues. The working hypothesis, however, also helps to explain the cognitive dysfunctions that arise during dopamine signaling imbalances found in diseases where inappropriate sensory gating, attention, and learning produce maladaptive behavior. A multidisciplinary approach that crosses neural levels of integration will be applied to understand the synaptic mechanisms underlying aversive memory retention and novelty detection. We will use an array of anatomical tracing and analytical techniques to determine the origin of dopamine signals that act upon hippocampal circuits. During the performance of behavioral tasks, these endogenous dopaminergic signals will be temporally controlled using optogenetic approaches, and in vivo synaptic plasticity will be measured in real-time. The delineated mechanisms within these critical neural circuits will provide targets for developing future therapeutic strategies that diminish cognitive impairments."
"9322319","PROJECT SUMMARY  Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) and other hepato-renal fibrocystic diseases (HRFD) are relatively rare recessive disorders, but constitute an important set of childhood nephropathies. Rare disease research requires greater collaboration than the efforts in common diseases where patient resources are routinely available and large repositories can be built locally. For the HRFD, experimental studies would be well served by case accrual that coordinates collection of clinical data, bio-specimens (DNA and tissues) and mutational information. The centralization and sharing of clinical and genetic information, as well as bio-materials, can provide a critical impetus for more rapid progress by the research community.  In this competitive renewal, we will continue to compile baseline and longitudinal clinical information in our HRFD Clinical Database; expand our bio-materials (DNA and tissue) repositories; and deploy new strategies to identify genetic mutations in ARPKD and other HFRD patients, including new tools to interpret PKHD1 missense variants. Clinical and genetic data, as well as patient bio-specimens, will be drawn from tertiary care centers throughout the Americas (North, Central, and South). Finally, we will utilize the learning management system established in our CTSA-funded program to establish a multi-modality resource for our expanding portfolio of HRFD-related educational information and tools.  Our goal for this renewal application is to acquire a sufficient volume of clinical data, biological specimens, and genomic information in a centralized resource to accelerate discovery research in human HRFD and integrate the resulting data in an enabling platform for developing new, targeted interventional strategies, assessing genotype-phenotype correlations, and identifying new disease genes by our Investigator User Base, as well as other members of the research community.  "

"9304776","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Amyloid Light-chain (AL) amyloidosis is a rare disease characterized by the formation and deposition of insoluble fibrillary proteins (amyloid) in extracellular spaces of tissues and organs resulting in severe structural and functional organ damage. Currently, treatment of patients with AL amyloidosis is limited to anti-plasma cell chemotherapy to reduce or eliminate the amyloidogenic light chain producing cells. Although the development of new agents has improved survival, the prognosis is still poor due to accumulation of pathologic fibrillar deposits and the resultant loss of vital organ function. In an effort to induce rapid removal of amyloid fro the body, Dr. Solomon developed a murine monoclonal anti-light chain antibody (designated 11-1F4) that is specific for light-chain amyloid fibrils. Moreover, administration of this agent into mice with induced subcutaneous tumors composed of human AL amyloid led to elimination, i.e., amyloidolysis, of the pathologic material with no apparent untoward side effects. To facilitate its use in humans, the murine mAb 11-1F4 has been chimerized under the auspices of the National Cancer Institute's Biological Resource Branch Developmental Therapeutic Program and amounts of GMP-grade chimeric (Ch) mAb 11-1F4 have been produced that are sufficient for a Phase 1a/1b therapeutic clinical trial.         The clinical trial proposes to (1) define the MTD and safety of (Ch) Ab 11-1F4 in a Phase 1a study; (2) determine the safety, tolerance and possible clinical benefit of the MTD of (Ch) Ab 11-1F4 in a Phase 1b study; and (3) determine the serum levels of (Ch) mAb 11-1F4 in treated patients by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) when given as a single intravenous infusion (Phase 1a) or as a series of four weekly intravenous infusions (Phase 1b). Proof of the efficacy of AL-fibril-specific mAb treatment would be an adjunct (in combination with anti-plasma cell drugs) in the treatment of patients with AL amyloidosis and may lead to improved medical management of this incurable and fatal disease."
"9366019","Role of RBC Reactive Oxygen Species and Their Vicious Cycle in Sickle Vasculopathy Abstract: In sickle cell disease (SCD), red blood cells (RBCs) play an active role in vasoocclusion, largely through adhesion to endothelium and activation of leukocytes. While it is established that excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in sickle RBCs leads to oxidative damage and accelerated hemolysis, the contribution of RBC ROS to RBC adhesion and leukocyte activation remains unclear. Here, we provide evidence for a novel pathogenic mechanism of sickle RBC ROS that promotes adhesion and vasoocclusion in SCD. We show that NADPH oxidase (Nox)-dependent ROS production in sickle RBCs mediates adhesion to the vascular endothelium. This ROS production is regulated by MEK/ERK and G-protein coupled-receptor kinase 2 (GRK2), a mechanism that can itself be stimulated by inflammatory cytokines and external ROS. Consequently, sickle RBC ROS form a positive feedback loop with MEK/ERK and GRK2. These findings suggest that ROS, MEK/ERK and GRK2 create an intracellular cycle regulating sickle RBC-induced vasoocclusion. We also have implicated small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) as regulators of RBC ROS. Specifically, these unusual regulators of cellular ROS are present in sickle RBCs at high levels that correspond to elevated ROS levels and RBC adhesion. We hypothesize that this deleterious cycle in sickle RBCs acts to promote vasoocclusion and drive SCD pathophysiology. We further hypothesize that disrupting components of this cycle can prevent vasoocclusion. Accordingly, we have recently shown that blocking MEK/ERK with MEK inhibitors reduces vasoocclusion in SCD mouse models. We also now demonstrate that scavenging ROS in sickle RBCs ex vivo suppresses ERK activation and sickle RBC-induced vasoocclusion in vivo. Additionally, we show that non-coding snoRNAs regulate pathologic RBC ROS production, since silencing these snoRNAs in mice reduces ROS levels in normal and sickle RBCs. We propose to further validate dynamic contributions of the RBC ROS cycle to vasoocclusive events and SCD pathophysiology, with the following Specific Aims. In SA1, we will show that the RBC ROS cycle is critical in controlling the cellular processes of vasoocclusion, and that disrupting this loop in vivo by scavenging ROS prevents vasoocclusion; in SA2, we will test the hypothesis that sickle RBC GRK2 is a druggable target to suppress this vicious cycle leading to cell activation; and in SA3, we will determine the role of the non-coding snoRNAs in ROS-stimulated sickle RBC pathology. Our long-term goal is to identify remediable sickle RBC abnormalities to reduce oxidative damage and vasoocclusion. We strongly believe that our studies will not only provide novel insights into the exact mechanisms of vasoocclusion and SCD pathophysiology, but will also lay the foundation for more rational approaches to therapies that better prevent oxidative damage and vasoocclusion in SCD."

"9429416","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exercise participation is an important determinant of cognitive health, particularly in aging. In fact, sedentary behavior has been singled out as the greatest modifiable risk factor causing cognitive decline and Alzheimer's Disease in the US, and ranks third worldwide. Despite the importance of physical activity and exercise, the exercise parameters that provide optimal cognitive health are not well defined, particularly with respect to the frequency and duration of exercise needed. Our data and others suggest that the exercise conditions that activate the underlying neurobiological mechanisms that enhance cognitive function can be flexible, and allow for intermittent and spaced exercise bouts. We propose the novel hypothesis that exercise establishes a type of molecular memory for the exercise stimulus, which regulates the frequency and duration of subsequent intermittent exercise that is needed to maintain cognitive benefits. The molecular memory remains during a defined temporal window, such that subsequent exercise (even low-level exercise normally sub-threshold to enhance long-term memory formation) can capitalize on the neurobiological events established by the initial experience of exercise, thus maintaining the benefits of exercise on cognitive function. We hypothesize that epigenetic mechanisms are fundamental for the molecular memory phenomenon, and serve to alter transcriptional processes through histone modifications to create stable changes in neuronal plasticity and giving rise to stable changes in behavior. Our goal in this proposal is to define the exercise parameters that establish a molecular memory, investigate the underlying mechanisms that enable exercise to more efficiently promote enhanced cognition, and explore if pharmaceutical manipulation can extend the molecular window established by exercise. Because benefits of exercise for improving cognition, particularly hippocampal function, rely in large part from induction of the key plasticiy molecule `brain-derived neurotrophic factor' (BDNF), we focus on BDNF induction and epigenetic modifications that control BDNF regulation. We propose three Aims. Aim 1 - Determine the effective exercise patterns and molecular memory temporal windows that result in long-term memory formation. Aim 2 - Determine the histone modification patterns resulting from exercise that establish a molecular memory for BDNF expression. Aim 3 - Determine if cognitive benefits of exercise can be prolonged by pharmacological manipulation of the epigenetic molecular memory established by exercise, using a novel selective histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) inhibitor. Overall, our research in this proposal will serve as a foundation for ultimately translating to humans the exercise parameters needed to maintain enhanced cognitive function."
"9375438","Project Summary/Abstract Adolescence is a period of heightened susceptibility to cocaine addiction. Certain aspects of addiction are also more severe in females than in males. Several factors have been proposed to mediate such heightened susceptibility in adolescents and females. What is unknown is if adolescents and females are less sensitive to conditions of external adversity associated with the process of obtaining cocaine. Perseveration of drug seeking and taking despite adversity and hazardous conditions is a hallmark of addiction, and has been hypothesized to be a key factor underlying susceptibility to develop addiction. The hypothesis of this proposal is that adolescents and females are less sensitive to adverse events required to obtain cocaine. Surprisingly, this hypothesis has not been tested extensively. Testing this hypothesis is important because it would underline that adolescents and females are a vulnerable population and provide an important reason as to why that is. This hypothesis will be tested by modifying an existing test, whereby rats need to surmount an ?aversive obstacle? in order to obtain cocaine. The aversive obstacle is in the form of an electric barrier (a portion of electrified floor) that rats need to traverse to obtain the drug. The intensity of the electricity is increased incrementally, until the rats reach abstinence. Ages (adolescents and adults) and sexes (males and females) will be compared for their ability to suppress cocaine intake in conditions of increased adversity to obtain the drug. The project is innovative in what it studies (age- and sex-differences in taking cocaine in conditions of adversity to obtain the drug). It is also innovative in the manner in which it implements and modifies an existing behavioral model to test the pursuit of drug taking despite adversity associated with the process of obtaining the drug. The project is significant, as it will provide important insight into understanding the nature of adolescent and female susceptibility to addiction."
"9209610","Abstract: The Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated Herpesvirus (KSHV) is the etiologic agent of several human cancers, including Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS) and Primary Effusion Lymphoma (PEL), which preferentially arise in immunocompromised patients and lack any effective therapeutic options. Human Endogenous Retrovirus Sequences (HERVs) constitute up to 8% of the human genome, yet not all HERVs remain silent passengers within our genomes. Some HERVs, especially the HERV type K (HERV-K), have been found to be frequently reactivated in patients with immunodeficiency, and in a variety of inflammatory diseases and human cancers. However, the role of HERV-K transactivation in viral oncogenesis, such as KSHV-related malignancies, remains unknown. Our preliminary data indicate that either KSHV de novo infection or ectopic expression of KSHV-encoded latent protein can transactivate the HERV-K from both host primary and tumor cells. We also found higher levels of HERV-K transactivation in the Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) from HIV+/KSHV+ patients than those from HIV+/KSHV- patients. There is a strong expression of HERV-K-encoded oncoprotein, NP9, within KS tissues isolated from our cohort of untreated AIDS patients. Further data indicate that HERV-K transactivation or the induction of HERV-K-NP9 protein expression is responsible for cell invasiveness and anchorage-independent growth of KSHV-infected endothelial cells. Based on these data, we hypothesize that transactivation of HERV-K may act as an important co-factor for KSHV pathogenesis and the development of virus-related malignant transformation. Therefore, targeting the transactivation of HERV-K could serve as a new interventional strategy against these malignances. To address this hypothesis, we propose the following Specific Aims: 1) To identify mechanism/s through which KSHV-encoded latent protein, LANA, transactivates HERV-K in the host cells. 2) To determine the role of HERV-K transactivation (particularly HERV-K-encoded oncogenic NP9 protein) in the pathogenesis of KSHV-infected cells in vitro and in vivo. 3) To assess the therapeutic value of targeting HERV-K NP9 protein against KSHV- induced tumorigenesis in vivo. Through these efforts, we aim to understand the role of HERV-K in the development of KSHV-related malignancies. This could also help elucidate the role of HERV-K transactivation in the pathogenesis of other herpesviruses or the progression of other human cancers. Additionally, these studies will provide the framework for the development of interventional strategies targeting HERV-K transactivation and its associated mechanisms for the treatment and/or prevention of KSHV-related malignancies in high-risk immunocompromised patients. !"
"9385255","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and alcohol addiction are significant public health concerns with serious effects on society and individuals. Adolescent binge drinking is common and contributes to anxiety and other psychiatric disorders in adulthood. Recent research shows that epigenetic mechanisms are responsible for the development of brain structures and are modified by alcohol exposure. The amygdala, known as a regulator of emotion, fear, and anxiety, undergoes epigenetic changes in response to adolescent alcohol use that leads to increased anxiety-related behaviors and abnormal synaptic plasticity in adulthood. However, the crosstalk between epigenetic enzymes and chromatin is enormously complex, and many of the mechanisms of adolescent alcohol exposure have yet to be elucidated. The discovery of novel epigenetic effectors of alcohol in the adolescent brain may lead to new treatment targets for adolescent alcohol exposure-induced adult psychopathology.  Our previous studies suggest that adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure in rats increases anxiety-like behaviors and decreases synaptic plasticity associated events in the amygdala in adulthood. Lysine demethylase 1 (LSD1; also known as Kdm1a) and its neuron- specific splice variant Lsd1+8a are histone demethylases that may be responsible for altering chromatin around important synaptic plasticity-associated genes in the adult amygdala following AIE. Additionally, microRNA-137 (miR-137) may be responsible for regulating Lsd1+8a and thereby affecting downstream histone methylation mechanisms and spinogenesis. This proposal is based on the hypotheses that AIE produces a persistent increase in miR-137 expression in the amygdala, decreasing LSD1+8a expression and increasing H3K9me2 at crucial synaptic plasticity-related genes leading to anxiety-like behaviors in adulthood. We will perform a series of experiments to test these hypotheses. We will dose AIE adult rats with acute ethanol to determine if this challenge will rescue the alterations in anxiety-like behaviors, gene expression,  histone methylation, and dendritic spines in the amygdala of AIE adult rats. We will inhibit Lsd1+8a in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) using shRNA in control rats to determine if Lsd1+8a inhibition alone can recapitulate the behavioral and epigenetic deficits of AIE in adulthood. Finally, we will determine if miR-137 inhibition in the CeA can rescue the alterations in anxiety-like behaviors, gene expression, histone methylation, and dendritic spines in AIE adult rats. Taken together, this proposal will increase the understanding of chromatin remodeling by adolescent alcohol and may identify novel pharmacological targets for the treatment of adult psychopathology-related adolescent drinking."
"9456155","Project Summary This proposal is focused on developing new technological approaches to study how local circuits in cortical brain regions function. The central goal of this project is to develop a new recording method, we term ?random aperture photometry?, that can monitor network state optically in combination with fluorescent Ca indicator probes that reflect activity in individual neurons. Unlike conventional photometry approaches where the entire microscope field-of-view is monitored using a sensitive light detector, in the method we propose to split the microscope output into multiple parallel image paths, each passing through a different mask that only allows light transmission through small apertures. By monitoring the total light transmission through the mask, this method generates an optical signal that sparsely samples the field of neurons labeled with fluorescent activity indicators. By employing multiple, independent image paths?each containing a mask with a different random arrangement of apertures?we can generate multiple signals that each reflect the ongoing network activity but are only weakly correlated. Our preliminary experiments and computer simulations suggest that signals from four independent masked pathways will likely be sufficient to decode network states evoked by different stimuli applied to the input layer of the dentate gyrus. The proposed work will use computer simulations, whole-cell patch clamp recording and optical methods to optimize and refine this method. We then will validate the ability of this new optical method to decode network states using bulk-loaded fluorescent Ca imaging while simultaneously assaying neuronal behavior using multiple intracellular recordings. We have used the intracellular recording-based method of assaying network states through a series of four recent publications. As with these previous studies, the proposed experimental work will be conducted using standard acute rodent brain slices. We believe this method is unique in providing non-invasive ?whole-circuit? views of circuit function and will be especially useful in identifying specific network states and the dynamics of network state transitions. This method is also complementary with standard multi-electrode array recordings and 2-photon Ca imaging techniques. While these methods also can sample over a wide area of brain tissue, the primary goal of both techniques (and conventional extracellular unit recordings) is to estimate activity in individual neurons. By contrast, our method intentionally sacrifices spatial resolution to generate network state-specific optical signals with high signal-to-noise ratios. Since our method uses standard Ca indicator dyes and single photon excitation, it can easily be applied in vivo once the methodological details are refined and validated through the proposed brain slice experiments."
"9335354","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation (AF) are the most common manifestations of cardiovascular disease in chronic kidney disease (CKD Over 40 million patients have CKD in the U.S. of which 30% develop HF and 15- 25% develop AF. Among CKD patients with HF, the incidence of preserved ejection fraction (PEF)-HF exceeds that of reduced ejection fraction (REF)-HF. Even the absence of clinical HF or AF, 75% of patients with CKD have left ventricular disease, 30% have abnormal electrocardiograms and ~50% have HF symptoms, all of which are associated with development of HF and AF. HF and AF often occur simultaneously, thus it is plausible that they may be interrelated through shared mechanistic pathways. Better understanding of the pathogenesis of HF and AF may identify possible therapeutic targets to improve current treatment for these diseases in CKD. The pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease is unique in CKD in part due to novel CKD-specific risk factors and metabolic effects of decreased clearance. Several promising biological pathways have been implicated in the pathogenesis of HF and AF in the general population and may be applicable to CKD including: myocardial ischemia, myocardial stretch, myocardial fibrosis and inflammation. Circulating cardiac biomarkers present an opportunity to understand these mechanistic pathways in humans. NT-proBNP is secreted from myocytes in response to myocardial stretch from pressure or volume overload. Troponin T rises in response to myocardial injury or remodeling. Galectin-3 is a beta-galactoside-binding lectin expressed by macrophages that induces cardiac fibroblasts, promoting myocardial fibrosis and adverse remodeling. Soluble ST2 (sST2) is a member of the IL-1 receptor family that promotes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis. Growth differentiation factor (GDF)-15 is a TGF-beta cytokine that increases in response to myocyte ischemia, mechanical stretch and proinflammatory cytokines. CKD-specific risk factors may lead to differences in these promising biological pathways in CKD, thus warranting specific evaluation in this population. The overall goal of this proposal is to test the association of these biomarkers with clinical HF and AF and with intermediate measures of subclinical disease to understand the biological underpinnings and pathogenesis of HF and AF in CKD. In the proposed study, we aim to test the hypothesis that biomarkers of myocardial ischemia, myocardial stretch, myocardial fibrosis and inflammation are associated with incident HF (particularly PEF-HF), HF symptoms and intermediate subclinical measures of HF (Aim 1) among participants with CKD in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort study. We will also test the hypothesis that these biomarkers are associated with incident AF and intermediate subclinical measures of AF among CRIC participants (Aim 2)."
"9330440","Abstract. Sequencing of transcribed RNA molecules (RNA-seq) is an invaluable tool for studying cell transcriptomes at high resolution and depth. STAR is a popular RNA-seq analysis suite that combines high accuracy and ultra- fast speed of mapping with a reach collection of built-in features and tools. STAR is used by hundreds of researchers, including several major consortia and institutions. We propose to significantly enhance and expand STAR capabilities in the following important areas.  1. Develop novel algorithms and tools integrated directly into STAR. RNA-seq analyses require combining multiple tools into ?processing pipelines? which is demanding task owing to bottlenecks and compatibility issues. We aim to overcome these impediments by integrating novel tools directly into STAR software: (i) mapping of RNA-seq reads to personal genomes utilizing genotype information to produce more accurate allele aware alignments, thus increasing precision of personal genomics analyses; (ii) mapping of long RNA reads from emerging sequencing technologies such as PacBio and Oxford Nanopore.  2. Increase accuracy and speed and of the core mapping algorithm. New applications, such as personal genomics, require significant improvements in mapping accuracy. We will enhance STAR mapping algorithm with (i) spliced seed extension through mismatches/indels; and (ii) limited local alignment so of the read ends. Tremendous increase of sequencing throughput has put a significant emphasis on the efficiency of the computational algorithms. To keep up with the increasing sequencing throughput, we will boost STAR algorithm with (i) vectorization of query-text comparisons using SIMD/SSE instructions; (ii) dynamical programming for seed stitching. The improvements in accuracy and speed will be validated in both simulated and real RNA-seq data. Mapping accuracy depends strongly on choosing the best mapping parameters for a particular dataset. We will devise automated parameter optimization procedures to eliminate guesswork in parameter selection.  3. Enhance user-friendliness, user support/education, and software maintenance. User-friendliness is crucial for bioinformatics software usefulness to the broadest audience. We aim to significantly enhance users' experience by developing STAR web user interfaces for both pre-run data input, and post-run exploring of results. To enable STAR analysis in the cloud, we will create STAR virtual machines on popular Amazon and Google cloud computing services, and develop Hadoop-based tools for distribute processing of the big datasets. We will also expand user support and education, continue to implement user- requested features and debug user-reported issues."
"9318312","Model Systems Core Project Summary Animal models are revolutionizing our understanding of IDDs, and such models provide fundamental insights into biological pathways and often display phenotypes that are similar to clinical indicators of the human disease, providing an opportunity to deduce mechanisms of disease pathology, and also to develop therapies. The Model Systems Core (MSC) is organized into three units ? the Animal Behavior Unit, the Neuropathology Unit, and the Functional Assessments Unit. The goal of the MSC is to provide expertise, resources, and assessment to Center investigators involved in the creation and evaluation of animal and cellular models relevant to IDD, drawing on strengths in genetics, brain imaging, bioinformatics, and neuroscience to provide advice, assistance, and services to investigators at all career stages. The specific aims are: 1) Provide consultation to investigators needing assessments in animal behavior, pathology and CNS function. A priority for the Core Directors and Unit leaders is to make certain that first-time users are guided to appropriate services and understand the complement of available resources; 2) Characterize neurological deficits in rodent and cellular models of IDD submitted by investigators. The MSC is configured to provide access to a range of experimental approaches including: i) functional phenotyping of mice and rats (learning and memory, motor/sensorimotor functions, alterations in emotionality/motivation, social interactions, sensory behavioral functions, depression-like behaviors, and behaviors related to models of Autism Spectrum Disorder; ii) histological services to evaluate IDD-related changes at the cellular level; and, iii) sophisticated, non- invasive imaging (MRI, functional connectivity optical imaging) as well as in vitro (including advanced microscopy of cellular models) and in vivo neurophysiological assessments, such as electroencephalography (EEG), polysomnography, and somatosensory evoked potentials in animal models of IDD; 3) Assess novel therapies and/or biomarkers in models of IDD in animal behavior, pathology and CNS function. Each Unit within the MSC is already configured to allow rapid, sensitive testing of novel therapies and/or biomarkers for IDD models; 4) Integrate information across units, cores and other existing facilities within the University. Together with the Unit leaders, MSC Directors will provide guidance for institutional resources both within and outside of the MSC. Together with the Scientific Advisory Panel, MSC Directors will also help investigators identify the best model system for a specific gene locus, clinical phenotype and/or screening for compounds to reverse disrupted function.

"9378509","Project Summary The ultimate goal of this proposal is to improve outcomes after an emergency department (ED) evaluation for suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS). ACS includes acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and unstable angina, and is the leading cause of worldwide mortality and morbidity. Suspected ACS is the second most frequent reason for U.S. ED visits and accounts for over 7 million annual encounters. The minority (13%) of ED chest pain visits are related to ACS, and diagnosis is challenging with high clinical and medico-legal stakes. To minimize missed ACS, the American Heart Association suggests non-invasive cardiac testing (e.g. stress electrocardiogram [ECG], stress echocardiogram [echo], stress myocardial perfusion [MP], or coronary computed tomography angiogram [CCTA]) within 72 hours, after serial biomarkers have excluded AMI. Furthermore, patients with suspected ACS are often admitted to an inpatient bed or observation unit to facilitate early non-invasive testing and to mitigate the risk of dangerous complications of ischemic heart disease. Evaluation of suspected ACS is the top reason for U.S. short-stay (<48 hrs) inpatient and observation admissions, and accounts for $3-10 billion in hospital costs per year. However, there is no evidence that early non-invasive testing or hospital based evaluation benefits patients. Current use of early non-invasive tests increases rates of invasive coronary angiography and revascularization without reducing AMI risk. The potential benefits of hospital admission in low-risk patients appear to be marginal (<0.2% cardiac event rate during admission). The widely varying rates of non-invasive testing (6x difference between top and bottom quartile hospitals) and hospitalization (7x difference between top and bottom quartile hospitals) for suspected ACS suggest pervasive uncertainty about the optimal approach. Using prospective observational data on ~170,000 patient encounters within an integrated health system, we will assess five early diagnostic (stress ECG, stress echo, stress MP, CCTA, or NO non-invasive testing) and three disposition (inpatient, observation, discharge) strategies: Aim 1. Compare 30-day outcomes of early diagnostic testing strategies for suspected ACS Aim 2. Compare 30-day outcomes of disposition strategies for suspected ACS Aim 3. Assess whether pre-test risk affects the comparative effectiveness of early diagnostic and  disposition strategies for suspected ACS Aim 4. Compare cost-effectiveness of early diagnostic and disposition strategies for suspected ACS The Aims address questions fundamental to any evaluation for suspected ACS: 1. What test if any is needed? 2. Is admission beneficial? 3. How does patient pre-test risk modify management? Aim 4 will inform policy makers and payers about the comparative value of different strategies."
"9234679","Project Summary Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) is a facultative gram-positive intracellular bacterium that causes infection in humans via ingestion of contaminated food. Severe infection can occur in elderly and immunocompromised patients well as in pregnant women and neonates. Infection can lead to meningitis, meningoencephalitis, brain abscess, and, for pregnant women, abortion, still-birth, and disseminated fetal infection. The high mortality rate of invasive Lm disease despite antibiotic treatment highlights the need for new effective therapeutic strategies for managing Lm infections. Previous studies have shown that distinct isolates of Lm can exhibit different tissue tropisms, resulting in the acquisition of novel target organ replication niches. A clinical Lm isolate, 07PF0776, was found to have an enhanced ability to target cardiac tissue based on amino acid variations present within InlB, a bacterial surface protein associated with host cell invasion. These amino acid variations appear to increase stability and promote binding to host surface heparin sulfate moieties, which results in recruitment of InlB to the host cell surface and stimulation of Met, the receptor bound by InlB. The Met receptor is abundantly expressed by placental tissue and is required for embryonic and placental development. Preliminary data has shown at least two Lm cardiotropic strains expressing the InlB variant exhibit significantly enhanced vertical transmission. We hypothesize that modification of InlB can expand the tissue repertoire of Lm and enhance invasion through the manipulation of Met signaling pathways, leading to increased rates of fetal transmission. The specific aims of this proposal will undertake a functional assessment of Lm InlB variant strains to examine their efficacy of vertical transmission as well as determine the mechanisms by which overexpression and/or increased stability of InlB increases vertical transmission. Aim 1 will undertake a functional assessment of cardiotropic strains for efficiency of vertical transmission to define and identify strains of Lm that pose an enhanced risk for fetal disease. Aim 2 will determine the mechanisms by which overexpression of InlB increases Lm vertical transmission. These studies will thus clarify how select Lm isolates gain access with high efficiency to placental/fetal tissues to cause devastating forms of neonatal disease and death."

"9470039","Exosome-mediated signaling in neuropathic pain Chronic neuropathic pain resulting from injury or malfunction of the nervous system is extremely difficult to treat. Unlike physiological or acute pain, where pain ceases after the damaged nerves or tissue heal, neuropathic pain can result in allodynia (pain from a non-painful stimulus) and hyperalgesia (heightened sensitivity to pain). The profound differences between acute and chronic pain indicate that pain results from the engagement of highly plastic molecules and circuits. Exosomes are 30-100 nm vesicles that carry mRNAs, miRNAs, proteins, and lipid mediators to recipient cells via circulation. Cells use these vesicles to communicate with both adjacent and distant cells. The molecules present on the surface of these vesicles enable them to target recipient cells. The exosomal contents vary depending on the source and the physiological conditions of cells releasing them, as well as on disease states that are known to alter exosome composition. However, not everything that is present in the parent cell is incorporated into the exosomes, suggesting that this well-regulated process is dynamically altered by signaling cues. Exosome uptake results in modulation of gene expression in recipient cells and represents a novel mechanism of cellular communication. There are no studies to date investigating alterations in exosome composition, function, and signaling mechanisms in a neuropathic pain state. Our preliminary data characterizing exosomes in serum from a mouse model of neuropathic pain four weeks after surgery showed a distinct exosomal miRNA and protein signature compared to sham control. We hypothesize that alterations in exosomal composition following nerve injury render them pronociceptive and contribute to the maintenance of chronic neuropathic pain. Using in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo approaches, we will investigate gene expression changes induced by uptake of exosomes from the serum of nerve injury model compared to sham control mice. Differences in exosomal uptake by recipient cells, preference for neurons, astrocytes or glia, alterations in proinflammatory mediators, thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity induced by exosomes and reversal of hypersensitivity by inhibition of exosome release will be investigated. These studies will provide insights on novel signaling mechanisms resulting from exosome release under chronic neuropathic pain and their role in the maintenance of pain. Elucidation of functional properties of exosomes can be beneficial in developing novel therapeutic intervention strategies to treat chronic pain."
"9533756","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The formation of neuromuscular synapses requires a mutual exchange of signals between motor neurons and muscle fibers leading to the formation of a highly specialized postsynaptic membrane and a highly differentiated nerve terminal, which insure that synaptic transmission is fast, robust and reliable. We found that Lrp4 has a key role in this exchange, as it acts bi- directionally to coordinate neuromuscular synapse formation. Lrp4 not only binds neuronal Agrin, activating MuSK and stimulating postsynaptic differentiation, but also functions as a direct muscle-derived retrograde signal that is necessary and sufficient for presynaptic differentiation. How Lrp4 stimulates presynaptic differentiation is not understood. Here, we propose to identify the motor neuron receptor for Lrp4 as a first step to understand how Lrp4 induces the differentiation of motor nerve terminals. Our previous studies showed that Lrp4 induces the clustering of synaptic vesicle and active zone proteins, thereby organizing the machinery for release of neurotransmitter. Retrograde signals, however, also cause motor axons to terminate and form synapses: in the absence of Lrp4 or MuSK, motor axons fail to stop and instead grow throughout the muscle without forming synapses. Here, we propose to determine whether Lrp4 is itself a 'stop' signal that arrests motor axon growth or whether Lrp4-mediated activation of MuSK leads to the production of a novel signal that control motor axon growth. The experiments described here should provide new insights into the mechanisms that control presynaptic differentiation during development and maintain neuromuscular synapses in adults. As such, these studies are likely to shed new light into neuromuscular diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, congenital myasthenia, myasthenia gravis and age-related muscle wasting, sacropenia."
"9308983","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite significant advances in neonatal intensive care, including directed antibiotic therapy, mortality from neonatal sepsis remains significant with more than three million deaths worldwide. The highest risk of mortality occurs in preterm, low birth weight (LBW) and very low birth weight (VLBW) neonates. During the initial funding period of this award, we made three novel observations: 1) the neonate relies predominantly on its innate immune system to recognize infections and to provide early protective immunity, 2) host innate immunity is also defective due in part to a failure of innate immune cells to recognize and respond to chemokines essential for recruitment and activation, and 3) adjuvant treatment of mice with TLR and NLR agonists can stimulate PMN function, improve protective immunity, and increase survival to sepsis through MyD88- and inflammasome-independent pathways. Based on these findings, our ultimate goal is to develop adjuvant- therapies based on TLR signaling that can reduce the incidence and severity of both early and late sepsis in LBW/VLBW infants. To accomplish this, there are three specific aims: 1) To delineate the mechanism by which pretreatment of neonates with TRIF-specific pattern recognition receptor (PRRs) agonists improves survival in neonatal sepsis; 2) To determine the mechanisms by which immune adjuvants improve protective immunity and outcomes to neonatal sepsis; and, 3) To determine whether LBW and VLBW infants express comparable defects in PMN chemotaxis, ROS production and bacterial killing seen in PMNs from murine models of neonatal sepsis, and whether treatment of these human cells with TLR4 agonists restores innate immune function. The first two specific aims will determine the mechanisms by which pretreatment of neonatal mice with TRIF-specific TLR4 agonists with and without alum adjuvants improves outcome from E.coli and polymicrobial sepsis. The final specific aim will validate whether the protective effect of TLR agonists and alum seen in neonatal mice are recapitulated in cord and peripheral blood from full-term and LBW/VLBW infants. The ultimate goal of these studies is the reduction of early and late sepsis with improved survival in the highly vulnerable LBW/VLBW infant population by augmenting their immature innate immune system. Ultimately, it is our goal (at the end of this proposed funding period) to move novel or FDA-approved adjuvants and unique TRIF agonists into preliminary clinical trials in LBW/VLBW infants at risk of developing sepsis."

"9330475","Project Summary: Project 1 aims to use polyclonal recipient Tregs in a compressed conditioning protocol to achieve mixed chimerism and tolerance to deceased-donor kidneys and/or islets. Islet transplantation for the cure of Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is currently limited by low 5-year survival rates. Poor islet survival is likely the result of islet loss due to alloimmune responses, recurrent autoimmunity, and toxicity from immunosuppressive drugs. Thus, this therapy can only ethically be offered to patients with life-threatening complications of T1D. Inducing tolerance to islets through the development of mixed chimerism has the potential to eliminate both alloimmune and autoimmune islet loss, as well as the need for immunosuppressive medications. There are several barriers to inducing mixed chimerism and tolerance to kidneys and/or islets using deceased donors that we aim to overcome. Our current tolerance induction regimen, developed in cynomolgus monkeys and translated to humans, involves a 6-day conditioning of the immune system prior to organ transplant and is therefore only applicable to living donation. Previous attempts to compress immune conditioning to 24 hours, to allow the use of deceased donors, failed to induce chimerism or tolerance. Additionally, durable chimerism may be required for reversal of autoimmunity in T1D patients and might then be necessary for optimal islet survival post- transplant. Since the kidney has been shown to contribute to tolerance in the case of transient chimerism, it is even more important to achieve durable chimerism in recipients of islet transplants without co-transplantation of a donor kidney if tolerance is to develop. We now have data showing that expanded polyclonal recipient Tregs can achieve markedly prolonged chimerism and more robust tolerance than has previously been possible in the cynomolgus model. We hypothesize that the addition of polyclonal recipient Tregs, that can be prepared in advance, to a compressed conditioning regimen, will permit the development of mixed chimerism and tolerance to kidneys and/or islets. Our approach targets patients with end-stage renal disease alone (Aim 1), patients with T1D and renal failure (Aim 2A), and finally T1D without renal failure (Aim 2B). Therefore, additional measures will be added in Aim 2 if durable chimerism is not achieved in Aim 1. Finally, accurate characterization of the mechanism(s) of tolerance following transient or durable chimerism in nonhuman primates is lacking, in large part due to the absence of precise tools to characterize deletional and regulatory mechanisms. In Aim 3, we will use standard immunologic assays combined with the high-throughput TCR CDR3 tracking system developed in Core B (based on the human TCR platform developed in this laboratory and modified for cynomolgus monkeys) to accurately quantify deletion/expansion of donor-reactive effector T cells and donor-specific Tregs. Islets will be provided by Core A and collaboration with Project 2 and the cores will be coordinated through Core C."
"9330476","Project Summary: Project 2 is specifically designed toward the development of a tolerance induction strategy for curative treatment of end-stage diabetic nephropathy, using living donor composite Islet-Kidney (IK) transplantation (Tx). Many diabetic patients in renal failure, especially children, have potential donors willing to provide both a kidney and islets for transplantation. Unfortunately, the quantity of islets obtained through partial pancreatectomy from living donors is often insufficient to achieve insulin independence following isolated islet Tx. We have previously demonstrated that the strategy of transplanting pre-vascularized islets as part of composite IKs in large animal models requires far fewer islets to achieve insulin independence than Tx of free, non-vascularized islets. Both renal and islet function were restored by IK tx across fully allogeneic barriers in nephrectomized diabetic baboons using a clinically relevant immunosuppression protocol. More recently, we reported the successful induction of tolerance of IKs in rhesus monkeys using a novel, reduced intensity, hematopoietic cell Tx protocol in a ?parent-to-offspring? combination. These data demonstrated ?proof of principle? for the approach of induction of tolerance of allogeneic islet-kidneys. However, although allograft tolerance was achieved, chimerism was transient and insulin supplementation was required early post transplantation. We hypothesize that components of the conditioning regimen and/or donor cell source may have had an early negative impact on islet function. We also hypothesize that induction of tolerance through durable mixed chimerism may be more effective than transient chimerism in reversing autoimmunity associated with T1D, as has been demonstrated recently in an NOD mouse model. We therefore propose here to: 1) optimize the conditioning protocol and mobilized cell product in ways that are expected to improve preservation of islet function during the tolerance induction phase (Aim 1), including replacement of CyA with Rapamycin and anti-CD40 mAb and. If needed, use of purifed HSC; 2) add ex-vivo expanded donor-specific Tregs to the induction regimen, in order to facilitate the establishment of durable mixed chimerism (Aim 2). This approach is possible with the use of living-related donors, from whom one can generate donor-specific Tregs in advance of the transplant; and 3) study the fate of both effector and regulatory T cells in recipients of IKs (Aim 3), in order to determine the mechanism of tolerance and identify potential biomarkers predicting tolerance vs rejection. These studies will involve assessment of the deletion or expansion of effector and regulatory T cells using a high-throughput TCR sequencing approach developed in Core B. Islets will be provided by Core A and collaboration with Project 1 and both cores will be coordinated through Core C."
"9381169","Mitochondrial dysfunction is a primary consequence of nearly all age-onset neurodegenerative diseases. Across eukaryotic species, however, mild mitochondrial stress can have beneficial effects on the lifespan of organisms. Studies on the roles of mitochondria in the aging process have suggested that reduced mitochondrial function during a critical window of development in the nematode C. elegans is sufficient to extend the lifespan of the organism. Mitochondrial stress during this time results in a massive and persistent restructuring in gene expression patterns, as evidenced by analyses of long-lived mitochondrial mutant animals. This sustained response to an early metabolic stress may allow the organism to adapt its adult metabolism to match predicted states of nutrient availability. Previously, we reported that reduced mitochondrial function specifically in the neurons was sufficient to extend the lifespan of the nematode C. elegans. Mild neuronal mitochondrial stress also caused an upregulation in mitochondrial stress signaling across distal tissues of the organism. We now report evidence for the requirement of a class of metabolic neurotransmitters in the dissemination of perceived mitochondrial stress. We also observe a neuron-specific epigenetic remodeling in response to mitochondrial dysfunction. We hypothesize that, after sensing metabolic stress, neurons transcriptionally remodel their gene expression patterns by activating a class of neuron-specific chromatin modifying enzymes. Transcriptional changes in the neurons then initiate a downstream neuroendocrine signaling event that is capable of activating mitochondrial stress responsive pathways across tissues and organs. This cascade of responses collectively serves to increase the metabolic fitness and lifespan of the organism."

He is now embarking on a research and career development program that will build on his rigorous Ph.D. training in developmental biology at the Harvard Medical School. Dr. Nissim will train under the co-mentorship of: Wolfram Goessling, M.D., Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School who is an internationally-recognized leader in the study of endoderm development and liver disease using zebrafish; and, David Cohen, M.D., Ph.D, Director of Hepatology at the Brigham and Women's Hospital and Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School who is a world-renown expert in liver lipid metabolism with a long track record of successful mentorship. To further guide completion of his research and career goals, Dr. Nissim will meet regularly with a Scientific Advisory Committee comprised of Dr. Peter Banks, Professor Cliff Tabin, and Dr. Len Zon, who will provide expertise in pancreas disease, developmental biology, and zebrafish methodology, respectively. Dr. Nissim's career development plan incorporates coursework and collaboration at the Harvard Digestive Diseases Center and the Harvard Stem Cell Institute. He has detailed a clear timeline for publication of his work in peer-reviewed journals, presentations at national meetings, and development of independent research projects and funding. Dr. Nissim is focused on developing novel diagnostic and treatment strategies for pancreas diseases that he sees in the clinic, including pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. Pancreatitis is the single most common gastrointestinal cause of hospital admission in the U.S., and pancreatic cancer remains one of the most lethal cancers. The objective of Dr. Nissim's research proposal is to investigate the function and therapeutic potential of Nuclear Receptor 5A2 (NR5A2), a gene recently implicated by a Genome-Wide Association Study but whose mechanism and impact on pancreas disease is not known. In preliminary work, Dr. Nissim has uncovered that NR5A2 plays a critical role in development of the pancreas and is required for normal differentiation of exocrine pancreas cells. Further, he has found that this developmental role may have relevance to adult disease, as NR5A2 expression is aberrantly lost in the context of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer when exocrine cell differentiation is disrupted. To explore these findings further, the Specific Aims of this proposal are (1) to delineate the role and pathway interactions of NR5A2 in pancreas development, and (2) to test the functional impact of modulating NR5A2 in zebrafish models of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. As a nuclear receptor, NR5A2 would make an ideal pharmacologic target, and thus findings of this work have direct translational potential for management of patients with pancreas disease."

In aim 2, we will examine neurodegeneration in the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum using oscillating gradient diffusion MRI and histology. In aim3, we will integrate the longitudinal multi-contrast MRI data with histological data in the central framework to characterize the spatiotemporal progression of neonatal HI injury and its regional specificity. We will then use the tools developed here to characterize HI injury in mice lacking functional Fas death receptor. We will also examine the neuroprotective effects of necrostatin in this model. We expect the project to provide detailed maps of temporal course of injury and regional susceptibility, extend our knowledge on the relationships between pathology and diagnostic markers in the mouse model, and shed light on the mechanisms of HI injury and potential treatments. This information and techniques developed in this project will be useful to design effective strategies for intervention and to monitor treatment response in studies using this or similar models."
"9319733","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): PROJECT 4 - Spinal cord injury (SCI) at a supralumbar level induces severe lower urinary tract (LUT) dysfunctions including detrusor-sphincter-dyssynergia (DSD) which results in inefficient bladder emptying, high voiding pressure and large residual urine volumes. This project will study the spinal pathways that regulate reflex activity of the external urethral sphincter (EUS) of the rat and analyze the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the development of DSD after chronic SCI. Based on our recent electrophysiological studies in SCI rats we hypothesize that the EUS exhibits two types of activity that are controlled by circuitry at two levels of the spinal cord. Tonic EUS activity that maintains continence during bladder filling is controlled by pathways at the L6-S1 segmental level and bursting activity which consists of intermittent contractions and relaxations of the EUS that facilitate voiding is controlled by neural circuits in the lumbar spinal coordinating center (LSCC) located in the L3-L4 spinal cord. Increased tonic EUS activity and reduced bursting activity after SCI increases urethral outlet resistance and reduces voiding efficiency leading to urinary retention. We propose that the LSCC is normally regulated by the brain to induce EUS bursting during voiding and this regulation is initially lost after SCI but recovers in chronic SCl animals due to remodeling of spinal synapses. However the recovery of LSCC function is negated by remodeling in the Le- Si cord that enhances tonic EUS activity leading to DSD. The role of spinal remodeling and its consequences on EUS function will be examined as follows. Aim 1 will use axonal and transneuronal viral tracing methods to characterize the components of the LSCC in intact, acute and chronic SCI rats. Aim 2 will examine the electrophysiological properties of the LSCC as well as its afferent input and output circuits using optical imaging and electrical recording in in vivo and in vitro spinal cord slice preparations. Aim 3 will use patch clamp methods and optical mapping of spinal cord slice preparations in combination with transneuronal virus tracing methods to identify the plasticity in L6-S1 spinal circuits controlling the tonic activity in EUS motoneurons that underlies DSD in chronic SCI animals."
"9388109","PROJECT SUMMARY Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disorder that classically involves joints. Pulmonary complications are common and major contributors to RA mortality. The etiopathogenesis of RA remain unclear. The low concordance rate of RA in monozygotic twins ( 15%) suggests the importance of environmental factors in RA. Secondhand smoke, or environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is an important environmental hazard to both children and adults, but children are especially susceptible. Gut microbiota is another potential environmental trigger for disease. We have reported that segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), a type of gut commensal, drives autoimmune arthritis by inducing Th17-mediated B cell differentiation. Excitingly, our most recent data show that a human commensal Escherichia coli isolate 2A (termed E.coli 2A) from spondyloarthritis patients also cause autoimmune augmentation. Immune cells activated at the environmental frontline, the mucosa, share similar homing receptors and thus lymphocytes activated from one mucosal site can home to other mucosal tissues. Based on this ?common mucosal immune system? principle, we hypothesize that ETS and gut microbiota crosstalk at the mucosal interface of the lung-gut axis to prime the Th17-mediated autoantibody (auto-Ab) response in the lung, triggering the RA-related lung disease that sets off systemic joint disease. We will test our hypothesis in both juvenile and adult K/BxN mice by determining: 1) the age-based window and mechanism for the ETS-mediated lung-gut axis of Th17 response with and without SFB or E.coli 2A; and 2) the role of the ETS- and SFB- (or E.coli 2A-) mediated Th17 of lung-gut axis in causing auto-Abs and disease. Remarkably, our new data support our hypothesis by showing that a robust SFB-induced Th17 response is accompanied by much higher auto-Ab level in the lung than spleen, the organ traditionally considered as the primary auto-Ab producing site in K/BxN mice. Next, we will determine the mechanism underlying ETS- and microbiota-mediated Th17 response by regulating survival, proliferation, differentiation, and/or recruitment of Th17 cells; or by affecting regulatory T cells, altering Th17 response. Because Th17 can exist as long-lived memory cells and the detrimental effect from childhood-exposure to ETS can last a lifetime, we will also examine the Th17 response after ETS cessation. As Th17 cells help B cell differentiation in K/BxN mice, we hypothesize that ETS- and microbiota-mediated lung Th17 cells can cause lung disease by inducing auto-Abs. We will perform a temporal comparison, and expect that ETS and microbiota will induce an earlier Th17 response, accompanied by B cell differentiation in the lung prior to the spleen. We will use Th17 ablation and molecular signatures of pathogenic and non-pathogenic Th17 cells to study the role of Th17 cells in ETS/microbiota-induced autoimmunity. Mucosal immunoregulation remains poorly understood but is of profound importance, as the mucosa harbors the frontline immune response to environmental stimuli, and their interactions can subsequently shape both mucosal and systemic diseases."
"9330470","This U19 proposal aims to achieve islet and kidney allograft tolerance through mixed chimerism in two complementary cynomolgus monkey projects that are supported by three cores. Both projects have relevance for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and curative therapy for Type 1 diabetes (T1D). They employ related approaches to achieve tolerance for deceased and living donor grafts, respectively. Project 1 aims to use expanded polyclonal recipient Tregs to develop a compressed conditioning regimen that induces tolerance of simultaneous bone marrow, kidney and islet allografts from deceased donors. We have previously used a 6- day conditioning protocol that is relevant only for living donors, to achieve transient chimerism and kidney allograft tolerance in monkeys and humans. We now aim to develop a conditioning protocol that could be initiated after identification of a deceased donor, allowing transplantation (Tx) within 24 hours. Our approach builds on our demonstration that expanded polyclonal recipient Tregs can achieve far more prolonged chimerism and more robust tolerance than has previously been possible in the cynomolgus model. Tolerance obviates the need for long-term immunosuppressive therapy with its destructive effects on islet grafts. Moreover, our studies in NOD mice have shown that non-myeloablative induction of durable mixed chimerism reverses advanced anti-islet autoimmunity, simultaneously avoiding the alloimmunity, autoimmunity and drug toxicity that currently limit the efficacy of islet Tx in T1D. Project 2 aims to develop a tolerance induction strategy for curative treatment of end-stage diabetic nephropathy using living related donor (LRD) composite Islet-Kidney (IK) Tx. The project builds on our observation that transplanting pre-vascularized islets as part of composite IKs in large animal models requires far fewer islets to achieve insulin independence than Tx of free, non-vascularized islets. We recently achieved tolerance of IKs in rhesus monkeys using a novel, low intensity, hematopoietic cell transplant protocol in a ?parent-to-offspring? combination. Project 2 aims to adjust components of the conditioning regimen and/or donor cell source that may have an early negative impact on islet function. Taking advantage of the ability to generate potent donor-specific Tregs prior to LRD Tx, we will test the ability of these cells to promote durable mixed allogeneic chimerism, with its potential to reverse T1D. Both projects will include extensive mechanistic analyses that build on a high-throughput TCR sequencing-based approach for tracking the alloreactive T cell repertoire that we have developed in humans and will apply to cynomolgus monkeys in Core B. Thus, we aim to achieve durable mixed chimerism in both projects to cure autoimmunity while simultaneously preventing alloimmune attack by inducing tolerance. Core A will provide monkey islets for both projects and Core B will develop a high throughput T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing platform that will be used to identify and track the fate of donor-specific alloreactive T cell clones, providing a unique mechanistic tool to be applied in both projects. Core C will provide administrative, biorepository and data management support for all of the projects and cores."

"9535605","ABSTRACT Cilia are essential organelles, with functions ranging from cell-cell signaling to the generation of homeostatic fluid flow in tubular organs. Consequently, an array of human congenital diseases has been characterized as ?ciliopathies,? because they share an etiology of defective cilia structure or function. Despite manifest roles in the disruption of the central nervous system, limbs, axial skeleton, kidneys, airway, brain, and reproductive tracts, our understanding of the mechanisms that govern ciliogenesis and cilia-mediated developmental patterning remain incomplete. We propose here to study the roles of a novel multi-protein complex that controls three crucial mechanisms: basal body docking, IntraFlagellar Transport (IFT) recruitment, and Planar Cell Polarity (PCP). We will do so using a combination of proteomics, in vivo cell biology, mouse genetics and human disease modeling. By focusing on proteins with demonstrated importance in development and disease, but for which no mechanism of action is yet known, experiments proposed here will provide important new breadth and depth to our understanding cilia-mediated developmental patterning, basal body docking, and novel cell biological processes in ciliary biology. In turn, these findings should provide greater insight to a range of congenital diseases including both the relatively mild Oral-Facial-Digital syndrome and the wholly lethal Short Rib Polydactyly."

Previously, NIDCD negotiated an IAA with NCHS for collaboration and funding of the 2008 Adult Balance/Dizziness Supplement and the 2012 Child Balance/Dizziness Supplement to the NHIS. The current fiscal year funds will provide partial support for the renewal of this collaborative effort between NCHS and NIDCD to fund the 2016 Adult and Child Balance/Dizziness Supplements to the NHIS. The new NHIS Supplements will include many of the same questions on Balance/Dizziness included in the earlier 2008 and 2012 studies, although revisions have been made to eliminate some questions in order to include new ones that higher on the current priority list. These questions on the new Balance/Dizziness Supplements will assist NIDCD to make program planning decisions on priorities with respect to the funding of research on the prevention of falls related to dizziness and balance. The results will also be analyzed for use in tracking the Department of Health and Human Services? (DHHS) objectives in Healthy People 2020. Results from this nationally-representative survey of the U.S. non-institutionalized, civilian population will help NIDCD make budget allocations to subject areas where needs are found to be most critical."
"9401451","Project Summary Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a decline in speech and language abilities, with relative sparing of other cognitive abilities. In recent years, significant advances have been made regarding the nature and treatment of PPA in monolingual speakers, however; the nature and treatment of bilingual speakers with this diagnosis has been relatively unexplored. Through the use of a historical dataset, this proposal will investigate differences in the trajectory of behavioral and neural decline in untreated bilingual speakers relative to monolingual speakers with PPA (within each variant), so that the long- term benefits of treatment can be discerned in future cases. In addition, this proposal will compare the trajectory of decline between monolinguals and bilinguals with PPA (within each variant), to observe whether bilingualism provides a behavioral or neural advantage in this focal dementia. Performance on selected speech-language and cognitive assessments will also be compared between groups. Structural neuroimaging will be used to examine longitudinal change in gray matter volumes. In this study, we will also prospectively implement two behavioral speech-language interventions (lexical retrieval training and a script training approach), and will systematically manipulate treatment targets in order to facilitate cross-linguistic generalization. We use a cognitive-neuroanatomical framework to predict differential responsiveness to cognate loading and to each treatment approach on the basis of each PPA variant?s distinctive cognitive-linguistic and neural profile. Ten Spanish-English bilingual individuals with PPA will receive speech language intervention. In rehabilitative studies of stroke-induced aphasia, cross-linguistic cognates have been observed to both facilitate and impede generalization, with no cost to within language gains. Therefore, this study will manipulate the density of cognate inclusion in stimulus sets, to determine the proportion of cognates that maximizes cross-linguistic generalization and minimizes competition. The relevance of this project to public health lies in its attempts to understand the nature and treatment of behavioral and neural changes in bilingual speakers with PPA. One goal of the Healthy People 2020 program is to reduce the morbidity and costs associated with, and maintain or enhance the quality of life for persons with dementia. PPA is a form of dementia that has been understudied, and bilinguals with PPA have been historically underserved. The findings from this proposal will provide clinically relevant evidence regarding the rate of decline and potential benefit of treatment in bilinguals with PPA. This project will provide the applicant with a unique training experience, which will include learning new methodologies and data analysis techniques. The applicant?s sponsors and consultants will provide expertise and mentorship in the areas of intervention, neuroimaging, bilingualism, experimental design and statistics; thus, preparing her to become an independent researcher in the fields of bilingual aphasia and dementia."
"9337481","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 25% of low-income families in the United States have a child with special health care needs (CSHCN), defined by the presence of a chronic physical, emotional, or behavioral health condition. Among this population, the risk of child maltreatment is disproportionally high. Neglect, a specific form of maltreatment defined as the failure to provide for a child's basic needs, accounts for the majority of maltreatment cases. This application describes a four-year mentored research and education plan that focuses on identifying high-risk periods for maltreatment experienced by CSHCN and pilot testing an intervention to prevent child neglect by promoting parental problem solving skills, distress tolerance, and emotional regulation. Based on the principles of dialectical behavioral therapy, this selective prevention intervention will be delivered to families who have had an initial unsubstantiated referral to child protective services for neglect. Such families represent a high- risk, readily identifiable population particularly amenable to a selective prevention strategy. My K23 research plan focuses on low-income CSHCN with an initial unsubstantiated report of neglect. The specific research aims are to 1) conduct a retrospective cohort study using the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System to examine the time period between initial referral for unsubstantiated neglect and re- referral to child protective services; and 2) conduct  pilot randomized controlled trial (n = 60) of a selective prevention intervention to field test stuy mechanics, use established quality improvement methods to optimize intervention delivery, and obtain empiric estimates of study parameters that will inform the planning of a subsequent fully-powered trial of the intervention model. My educational objectives are to gain further training and experience in 1) the principles of intervention adaptation science, including intervention development, implementation, and evaluation; 2) the use of established interview techniques to evaluate parental reflective capacity (parents' understanding of their own and their child's behavior, thoughts, and emotions) as a potential theory-based mediator of the intervention; 3) the design and conduct of behavioral intervention research; and 4) the ethics of conducting clinical research with vulnerable populations. My long-term goal is to develop a replicable intervention that can be reliably delivered to high-risk families to decrease the risk of child neglect. The research in this proposal builds directly on my prior work, which has focused on the development of a theory-based intervention to prevent child neglect in high-risk families. I have identified an experienced mentoring team and a supportive research environment, which will ensure that I will attain my immediate and long-term goals. The results from this work will position me to submit a competitive R01 grant to conduct a fully-powered efficacy trial of the intervention and establish myself as an independent investigator."
"9382019","7. PROJECT SUMMARY Five-Dimensional Single-Molecule Nanoscopy for Sensing and Imaging the Dynamic Functions of Biomolecules This project will implement five-dimensional (5D) single-molecule (SM) nanoscopy to detect and visualize the dynamics of biological structures within living cells with nanoscale resolution. This project will be the first demonstration of super-resolution (SR) fluorescence imaging capable of resolving the 3D position and 2D orientation (i.e., x, y, z, pitch, and yaw) of single molecules in living biological systems. Five-dimensional measurements are needed to elucidate biomolecular interactions because molecules are not simple isotropic spheres; their orientation and/or conformation critically determine how they interact with each other. Super-resolved fluorescence microscopy, awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2014 and also termed optical nanoscopy, produces images of structures within living cells with resolution beyond the optical diffraction limit (~250 nm for visible light). One fundamental drawback of SR microscopy is its inability to measure the activity and function of molecules (e.g., binding, conformation, structural disorder, etc.) since its images only depict the 2D or 3D spatial positions of fluorescent tags. This limitation is a consequence of traditional microscope designs, which cannot measure the phase or polarization of light. Here, 5D SM nanoscopy will be developed to measure the dynamic activities of biomolecules by innovating and combining two synergistic approaches: 1) use binding- activated fluorogenic probes for imaging biological structures and 2) design and utilize integrated optical hardware and image analysis software for visualizing the 3D position (x, y, z) and 2D orientation (? and ? in spherical coordinates) of fluorescent probes. Optical nanoscopes will no longer simply focus light onto a camera to create 2D images; rather, the fluorescent light within the imaging system will be ?bent? specifically so that molecular position and orientation can be directly measured from the images captured by the camera. Lipid nanodomains are thought to control the trafficking of biomolecules across the cell membrane. A critical barrier to understanding these activities is our inability to directly visualize these domains. Five-dimensional SM nanoscopy will visualize nano-polarity and nano-fluidity of cell membranes by using fluorescent molecular sensors to diffuse, collide, and temporarily bind to biomolecules of interest within a cell, lighting up in the process. The rotational mobility of these probes will directly measure the polarity and/or fluidity of their environment. The aggregation of A?1-42 on the membranes of cultured human neuroblastoma cells (SH-EP cells) will be studied with a two-color variant of 5D SM nanoscopy to obtain nanoscale resolution. Simultaneously, lipid rafts will be visualized using lipid-specific fluorescent molecular sensors. This approach will reveal the dynamic nanoscale interactions between lipid nanodomains and A?1-42, especially how lipid phase affects the binding of A?1-42 and how the accumulation of A?1-42 remodels membrane morphology. By visualizing the nanoscale dynamics of both biomolecules simultaneously with SM sensitivity, the formation mechanism of toxic A? species and the impact of membrane physiology on the progression of Alzheimer?s Disease will be elucidated."
"9279624","Project Summary Abstract: Our capability to apply high-throughput molecular profiling technologies to increasingly large cohorts and sample sets is significantly expanding our understanding of human biology and complex disease. The Genotype Tissue-Expression (GTEx) project is creating a unique resource of genetic variation and gene expression across a wide range of human tissues. Upon completion this will include RNA sequence data from over 25,000 samples spanning 53 human tissues/organs and whole genome and exome sequence data from 960 donors. Additional data types not yet generated will include miRNA-seq, protein levels, DNA methylation, ChIP-seq, and DNase I hypersensitive site data among others. The ability to easily access, interpret and integrate these large data sets by a wide range of users with varying needs and skills is becoming of critical importance to leverage the full utility of the data. The GTEx Portal (http://gtexportal.org/) is the most widely accessed resource for the GTEx project, hosting all unprotected data, analysis results and numerous visual exploration tools, and has been enthusiastically received by the scientific community. To maximize the impact of this resource, we plan to expand the portal to: host data currently in production and new data types still to be generated; present novel and integrative analyses of existing data, and data from external sources; and to develop and share flexible tools for data analysis, visualization and access. Aim 1. We will host and support all open-access GTEx data and analysis results, performing systematic re-analyses of the data with new methods to reflect the state-of-the-art in RNA-seq analysis. We will add all new data sets to the portal to include novel assays (e.g. mi-RNA-seq, protein, methylation assays, etc/), derived analysis results (e.g. trans-eQTLs, splice- QTLs, GWAS enrichment analyses, protein-QTLs, etc.), and RNA-seq data sets from external investigators. Aim 2. We will work closely with both small focus groups of tool developers and engage our large user-base to identify and prioritize new features for development to display and integrate between multiple data types, and collaborate with other large genomic resources (e.g. ENCODE, UCSC and ENSEMBL browsers) to enable better integration of data sources and to enhance the utility and accessibility of the GTEx resource. Aim 3. We will automate and share all analysis pipeline tools with the scientific community. To support a wide range of user access needs, we will develop an open-source API to provide comprehensive data access, and also improve visualization tools and user-driven data analyses on the portal. To maximize use of the resource, we will design and offer training videos and outreach workshops.  "

"9382797","Project Summary/Abstract Chronic pain is the most common complaint of patients, affecting over 100 million Americans, and costing the nation more than $650 billion/year in medical treatment and lost productivity. Most chronic pain patients are resistant to pharmaceutical or surgical therapies, in large part because the underlying pathophysiology of their chronic pain condition is unknown. The ultimate goal of this research program is to rectify this deficiency. Most spinal cord pain-related afferents target the parabrachial nuclear complex (PB), which then projects to multiple pain-related cortical and subcortical targets. New preliminary data indicate that inhibitory inputs from the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) to PB are reduced in a rodent neuropathic pain model: chronic constriction of the infraorbital nerve (CCI). This reduced inhibition dramatically `amplifies' both spontaneous and evoked PB neural activity. As a consequence, there is increased PB excitation of several pain-related nuclei, including the rostral ventral medulla (RVM), a key node of the descending pain modulation system. Based on this exciting new evidence we hypothesize that chronic pain results from the development of a pathologic positive feedback network: Reduced inhibition from CeA to PB ?> amplified PB activity ?> increased activation of RVM neurons ?> increased activation of nociceptive neurons in the spinal cord. With the use of electrophysiological recordings from intact rodents and from brain slices, and taking advantage of behavioral approaches, optogenetics and pharmacogenetics, we will directly test this overarching hypothesis. Specifically, we will (1) Test the hypothesis CCI causes a progressive and significant reduction of inhibitory inputs to nociceptive PB neurons that project to RVM, and dramatically increases their firing; (2) Test the hypothesis that amplified PB activity is due to reduced inhibition from CeA.; (3) Test the hypothesis that reduced CeAI inhibition to PB is causally related to the development of CCI-Pain. The anticipated findings are expected to reveal novel mechanisms for the development of chronic pain, and may lead to development of novel therapies to ameliorate, and perhaps even prevent, this devastating condition."
"9358693","The effects of drinking alcohol within recommended limits on risks of CVD, diabetes, and related diseases are perhaps the most important questions yet to be answered in the fields of alcohol, nutrition, or prevention. Approximately half of all adults worldwide report current or former alcohol consumption, and the benefits or risks that alcohol poses to their health urgently need clarification. Epidemiological studies have consistently found that alcohol intake within recommended limits is associated with lower risk of coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and diabetes, yet no long-term randomized trial of alcohol consumption on risk of any chronic disease has yet been performed. In direct response to PAR-16-363 (Multi-Site Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial Research Center on Alcohol's Health Effects), we propose a worldwide, six-year, balanced-design randomized trial, comparing the effects of one standard serving (~14 grams) of alcohol intake daily to abstention on risk of CVD, diabetes, mortality, and related outcomes among 7,800 adults at above-average cardiovascular risk worldwide. To maximize feasibility and reflect actual use most closely, we propose to test alcohol consumption per se to abstention and thus to offer participants flexibility in their choice of beverage, while employing novel and intensive yet efficient methods to monitor safety. The Primary Specific Aim of this trial is to determine the effects of 14 gm of alcohol intake daily compared with abstention on risk of major cardiovascular events or death (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hospitalized angina, need for revascularization, or death) over an average of 6 years of follow-up among 7,800 adults aged ?50 years with estimated 10-year CVD risk ?15% or prevalent CVD >6 months prior to enrollment. Secondary Aims will test the effects of alcohol on risks of incident diabetes and major cardiovascular events. Tertiary Aims will test risks of hard cardiovascular events and progression to impaired fasting glucose. Similar to other large randomized trials, we will establish ~16 centers worldwide using a stepped approach, with a 9-month vanguard phase among 7 centers in the US, Europe, Africa, and South America (in this application), followed by a second wave of additional sites to complete enrollment. Participants will be monitored for safety in multiple complementary ways, including brief electronic real-time reporting and validated yearly instruments and laboratory measures. We have brought together highly successful groups in the US and Europe to establish clinical, data, and biospecimen coordinating centers, our field centers include many of the most experienced clinical trialists anywhere, and our group has strong working relationships with NIAAA and other NIH staff necessary to ensure seamless collaboration during a U10-funded cooperative research endeavor. In this application, we propose the first randomized clinical trial of alcohol consumption, aiming to determine whether it increases or decreases the risk of CVD and diabetes among adults at above-average cardiovascular risk worldwide."

"9366764","Project Summary/Abstract Despite the tremendous amount of data that has been generated over the last decade regarding the human intestinal microbiota, we still know little about energy generation processes of most of the abundant members of this ecosystem. This gap in our fundamental knowledge of the gut microbiota hinders our understanding of how the Bacteroides interact with other community members, the conditions in the gut environment that contribute to microbial compositional changes, and how we may appropriately alter the composition of the ecosystem to improve human health. Bacteroides is the most abundant and stable genus of the human intestinal microbiota with strains colonizing their hosts for decades. Currently, Bacteroides are predicted to have a primitive anaerobic respiration pathway that would produce little energy to power cellular processes. In this application, based on strong supporting data, we will test our premise that Bacteroides have a more complex respiration pathway that creates a much larger amount of energy including the direct generation of both H+ and Na+ gradients to power cellular processes. Central to this new paradigm is our prediction that Bacteroides have a complete aerobic respiration pathway that allows them to utilize oxygen at the mucus layer of the colonic epithelium, which we predict significantly contributes to their fitness in the gut. In addition, we will test our hypothesis that aerobic respiration by the Bacteroides has community-wide effects, significantly contributing to the low oxygen environment of the colon, allowing oxygen intolerant members to colonize the gut, especially near the mucus layer. The objectives of this application will be addressed in three aims, taking advantage of the diverse strengths of three co-PIs. In Aim 1, we will use genetics, functional assays and biochemistry to completely elucidate both the aerobic and anaerobic pathways of Bacteroides. In Aim 2, we will focus on the ion gradients that the respiration pathway creates and the cellular processes that they energize. In Aim 3, we will use gnotobiotic mouse models to test which enzymes of the respiration pathway are critical for in vivo fitness, the role of aerobic respiration in conferring a fitness advantage to the Bacteroides, and the community wide effects of aerobic respiration on the gut microbiota and colonization of enteric pathogens. We predict this project will reveal new paradigms that will alter our thinking about Bacteroides, their ecological effects in the gut microbiota, and the conventional wisdom that these bacteria are strict anaerobes."
"9362936","Summary Significant progress has been made in using neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein measurements as Alzheimer disease (AD) biomarkers. However, there is still a critical need to identify more reliable and reproducible biomarkers with further improved diagnostic accuracy, especially to differentiate AD from other dementias, to track or monitor the disease progression and to objectively evaluate drug effects. There is also a growing interest in developing novel biomarkers that could reflect different aspects of AD pathology and accurately detect pathogenic components of AD before appearance of significant cognitive decline, thereby assisting with AD diagnosis at early symptomatic and even preclinical stages. This proposal is designed to meet several major challenges of current biomarker research, specifically: 1) difficulties in development of antibody-based, quantitative protein assays for most novel candidates identified by proteomic profiling and significant variations associated with most existing immunoassays, 2) low sensitivity and specificity of blood-based markers, and 3) detection of AD at early or even preclinical stages. To address the problems of antibody-based assays, our strategy is development of targeted mass spectrometry-based techniques, such as selected reaction monitoring (SRM), to identify unique peptide markers derived from proteins either showing promise in previous proteomics profiling, or known to be critical to AD pathogenesis in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). To facilitate discovery and validation of blood based biomarkers, a specific population of central nervous system derived plasma exosomes, the cargo-carrying microvesicles recognized recently to transport biomolecules among different cells or organ systems, will be isolated before SRM analysis. The unique peptide markers will be tested in several large, well-established cohorts, e.g., Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers (ADRCs) affiliated with the University of Washington, Oregon Health and Science University, University of California at San Diego, and University of Pennsylvania, and ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative), with cross-sectional and longitudinal samples collected, along with extensive clinical characterization. Finally, to improve early diagnosis, we will make use of a very early MCI cohort consisting of subjects at elevated risk for AD, with the goal of discovering biomarkers capable of identifying subjects with early or preclinical AD. The studies designed for this project, if successful, have the potential to result in a panel(s) of biomarkers that are robust, with less variation than can currently be achieved, and in a body fluid that is readily accessible in a regular clinical setting. Markers for early diagnosis and progression of AD are critical in understanding how to arrest or slow AD progression."
"9358702","PROJECT ABSTRACT The effects of drinking alcohol within recommended limits on risks of CVD, diabetes, and related diseases are perhaps the most important questions yet to be answered in the fields of alcohol, nutrition, or prevention. Approximately half of all adults worldwide report current or former alcohol consumption, and the benefits or risks that alcohol poses to their health urgently need clarification. Epidemiological studies have consistently found that alcohol intake within recommended limits is associated with lower risk of coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and diabetes, yet no long-term randomized trial of alcohol consumption on risk of any chronic disease has yet been performed. In direct response to PAR-16-363 (Multi-Site Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial Research Center on Alcohol's Health Effects), we propose a worldwide, six-year, balanced-design randomized trial, comparing the effects of one standard serving (~14 grams) of alcohol intake daily to abstention on risk of CVD, diabetes, mortality, and related outcomes among 7,800 adults at above-average cardiovascular risk worldwide. To maximize feasibility and reflect actual use most closely, we propose to test alcohol consumption per se to abstention and thus to offer participants flexibility in their choice of beverage, while employing novel and intensive yet efficient methods to monitor safety. The Primary Specific Aim of this trial is to determine the effects of 14 gm of alcohol intake daily compared with abstention on risk of major cardiovascular events or death (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hospitalized angina, need for revascularization, or death) over an average of 6 years of follow-up among 7,800 adults aged ?50 years with estimated 10-year CVD risk ?15% or prevalent CVD >6 months prior to enrollment. Secondary Aims will test the effects of alcohol on risks of incident diabetes and major cardiovascular events. Tertiary Aims will test risks of hard cardiovascular events and progression to impaired fasting glucose. Similar to other large randomized trials, we will establish ~16 centers worldwide using a stepped approach, with a 9-month vanguard phase among 7 centers in the US, Europe, Africa, and South America (in this application), followed by a second wave of additional sites to complete enrollment. Participants will be monitored for safety in multiple complementary ways, including brief electronic real-time reporting and validated yearly instruments and laboratory measures. We have brought together highly successful groups in the US and Europe to establish clinical, data, and biospecimen coordinating centers, our field centers include many of the most experienced clinical trialists anywhere, and our group has strong working relationships with NIAAA and other NIH staff necessary to ensure seamless collaboration during a U10-funded cooperative research endeavor. In this application, we propose the first randomized clinical trial of alcohol consumption, aiming to determine whether it increases or decreases the risk of CVD and diabetes among adults at above-average cardiovascular risk worldwide."
"9316900","Adolescents are notorious for risky behavior, such as drug and alcohol use initiation. A popular theory posits that adolescent risk-taking is partly attributable to robust functioning of earlier-developing mesolimbic motivational neurocircuitry that is poorly controlled by immature frontocortical executive-control neurocircuitry. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) findings of increased mesolimbic recruitment (including ventral striatum (VS)) by rewards in adolescents compared to adults support this theory, in that activation of VS reflects covert emotional responses to incentives. Other studies, however, have shown blunted VS recruitment by reward-predictive cues in adolescents compared to adults. Task features may explain this discrepancy, but have never been systematically explored within-subject in age-group comparison. For example, tasks that elicited relatively increased VS activation in adolescents have featured colorful imagery, payoffs of uncertain magnitude, making choices, and cue-contingency learning. Conversely, studies have shown reduced VS activation by reward prospects in adolescents in tasks with explicit payoffs for vigilance-intensive motor performance. Adolescent motivational neurocircuitry may be especially activated by the affective components of rewards, whereas the fully-developed adult brain may more robustly recruit VS as part of a fully-developed executive-control feedback loop (that includes VS to incorporate incentive information) to sustain attention. Notably, the VS is also recruited by vigilance in adults even in non-incentivized contexts. During instrumental behavior, VS recruitment in adolescents may be primarily driven by the affective components of reward, whereas VS recruitment in adults may primarily reflect optimal attention allocation. This R21 project will launch a research program aimed at providing critical contextual nuance to the development of human reward processing. Neurotypical adolescents and adults will perform a novel fMRI reward task that holds constant the expected value of all rewards, but varies whether rewards are 1): explicit, 2) dependent on vigilance-intensive responding, and 3) dependent on a successful choice versus a single response option. Finally, dynamic causal modeling will be employed to measure corticostriatal connectivity as a function of age and reward demands. If adolescents show greater VS activation by choosing responses for rewards or for uncertain payoffs, and adults show greater VS responses to reward in executive control-demanding trials, it will help resolve controversial literature, and clarify reward contexts that best engage motivational circuitry in adolescents. Discovering the incentive contexts that most strongly engage adolescent motivational neurocircuitry can inform each of: a) policies to prevent risky behavior in teens, b) contingency management and other incentive-based therapies for behavior change in adolescence, and c) components of longitudinal developmental projects, by identifying reward task features that yield the most robust mesolimbic signal, and are most germane to drug abuse risk."
"9410579","Abstract  Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading causes of global mortality. Nearly one-third of the world's population is infected with M. tuberculosis, an estimated 10.4 million new cases of TB develop annually, and 1.4 million persons die from the disease. The HIV pandemic and TB/HIV co-infection have fueled escalating TB incidence, and complicated TB management and control. The emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug resistant (XDR) TB has exacerbated the threat to public health and created a renewed sense of urgency to control the disease. Treatment of MDR-TB leads to emergence of additional drug resistance in 6-20% of patients on treatment. We propose to investigate the causes of emergence of mycobacterial drug resistance in an observational cohort study, the Predictors of Resistance Emergence Evaluation in MDR-TB Patients on Treatment (PREEMPT) Study. This proposal takes advantage of two existing TB cohort studies in India and Brazil (Regional Prospective Observational Research for Tuberculosis: RePORT India and RePORT Brazil), co-funded by NIAID and the Indian and Brazilian governments, respectively.  In the PREEMPT study, we will enroll 400 patients with MDR-TB in India and Brazil over a 24-month period and follow them prospectively for 3 years. The proposal has the following Specific Aims:  Aim 1: To determine whether low serum antimycobacterial drug concentrations contribute to the emergence of drug resistance in MDR TB patients, and whether HIV seropositivity is a risk factor for low serum drug concentrations and/or the emergence of resistance.  Aim 2: To determine the contribution of increased DNA mutation (caused either by an intrinsic property of the M. tuberculosis strain or by FQ treatment) to clinical emergence of drug resistance in patient isolates.  Aim 3: To determine whether mutations responsible for drug resistance can be detected early during treatment, when an intervention to prevent XDR-TB might be possible.  This proposal builds on an existing TB research framework to study mechanisms of emergence of TB drug resistance during MDR-TB treatment. It is very likely that similar mechanisms will explain emergence of TB drug resistance during treatment for drug-susceptible TB. Each of the proposed mechanisms of emergence of resistance that we will investigate has direct implications for new regimen designs, new drug administration algorithms and new drug susceptibility monitoring strategies that could prevent emergence of resistance in patients with TB with and without HIV."

"9445655","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Absence seizures occur most commonly in children as staring spells lasting 5-10 seconds, with rhythmic ?spike-wave? discharge (SWD) on electroencephalography (EEG). They can occur up to hundreds of times per day and are not benign, with deficits in attention and psychosocial function in some cases persisting into adulthood or even after seizure suppression. The mechanisms by which absence seizures impair cognition are not known. One intriguing but little-studied aspect of absence seizures is the fact that some episodes impair and others spare behavioral responses even within the same individual. The relationship between variable absence behavioral severity and neuronal activity may provide fundamental insights into the pathophysiology of seizures. Prior human studies and animal models have shown widespread EEG and fMRI increases as well as decreases during absence seizures. We recently found in a large patient sample that absence seizures with more severely impaired behavior had larger fMRI and EEG amplitude in widespread brain networks. We also found that abnormally enhanced fMRI synchrony persists between bilateral cortical regions even when seizures are not present in patients and in animal absence models. The neuronal basis for these changes both at rest and during SWD is not known, but our recent work in rodent absence models and normal conditions suggests that the amplitude of fMRI signals is related to changes in the total population activity of neurons. Therefore our central hypothesis is that the severity of absence seizures is determined by a combination of the number of neurons involved and their firing pattern in widespread brain networks before and during seizures. An important limitation of previous work has been anesthetic agents, which markedly alter fMRI responses and the excitability of neurons. This may explain why most animal models show cortical fMRI increases during SWD whereas human studies show a predominance of sustained cortical fMRI decreases. Because of this discrepancy the neuronal basis of physiology changes in absence seizures remains uncertain. We recently habituated genetic absence epilepsy rats of Strasbourg (GAERS) to allow awake-head fixed experiments. Initial measurements in this new model show sustained cortical fMRI and CBF decreases during SWD much more closely resembling humans. We now plan complementary high spatiotemporal resolution experiments in this awake model including fMRI, electrophysiology and behavior to fully understand the neuronal basis of variable severity in absence seizures. Our aims are to first image the networks involved at baseline and during severe versus mild SWD, and to relate the neuroimaging changes to spike and wave amplitude on EEG. Second, we will use multiunit and neuronal ensemble recordings to determine the neuronal basis of severe versus mild SWD. Third, we will relate the physiological severity of SWD to behavior through auditory detection and response tasks. The integration of information across these levels will increase our understanding of neuronal changes in absence epilepsy potentially leading to new treatment options."
"9330166","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The mission of the Host-Pathogen Interaction Core (HPIC) is to advance basic science, as well as translational and discovery studies relevant to lung disease. A central service of this Core is to provide expertise using a co-culture platform of bacterial biofilms on human airway cells developed at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth. This Core also provides a range of airway cell lines, as well as primary human airway epithelial cells from CF and non-CF donors, to support studies assessing host-pathogen interactions of relevance to the lung. This Core facilitates ongoing studies of COBRE Lung Biology Center (LBC) investigators and the pilot studies supported via this COBRE 111 application. The notable accomplishments of the HPIC include: 1) Development of a novel co-culture model system; 2) Assistance with a wide range of host-pathogen interaction studies by providing expertise in cell culture, siRNA and other molecular techniques, and electrophysiology studies; and 3) Coordinating with industry to develop new therapeutics aimed at chronic infections of the lung. The HPIC was launched in 2010 in response to a growing need by COBRE LBC investigators for support in crosscutting studies at the interface of bacterial pathogenesis and the host airway. We leveraged a set of earlier findings from the Stanton and O'Toole labs, in particular the study of bacterial biofilms on airway epithelial cells and host-pathogen interactions, to build a critical set of novel capabilities that have been used extensively by LBC investigators since the inception of this core. The HPIC was developed to meet the unique research needs of LBC investigators and received approval and strong backing from the External Advisory Committee, who deemed it critical to meet the needs of the evolving LBC. This Core is directed by George OToole, Ph.D., Professor of Microbiology and Immunology. Dr. OToole has over 20 years of experience in bacterial systems, and since 2000 has worked closely with Dr. Bruce Stanton, COBRE Director and PI, on a variety of projects that directly resulted in the development of the central capabilities of this Core."
"9409910","Hearing aids are the principal tool today for ameliorating age-related hearing loss and its significant social, cognitive and functional costs to patients and society at large. However, many individuals who are prescribed hearing aids do not use them at all, or use them only occasionally. Most reasons behind the ?hearing aid in the drawer? phenomenon relate to the characteristics of the sound produced, and could, in theory, be addressed with the correct signal processing strategy. The problem persists despite the increased complexity and power of new devices, for three reasons: (a) The hearing aid parameters, as set in the clinic, introduce distortion or render audible many sounds that the hearing impaired user had become accustomed to not hearing. The novelty is often so uncomfortable for the user as to discard the device. (b) The optimum parameters vary depending on the listening task and environment. Under some conditions, a device with parameters designed for a different condition will perform worse than no device at all. (c) The clinical fitting is derived from a non-ideal way to assess auditory function (the pure- tone audiogram). The optimum parameters for the actual impairment may be different from those of the prescribed fitting. Although it is true that the physiological mechanisms make it impossible to process sound so as to completely reverse the effect of sensorineural hearing loss, a device that delivers some benefit at all times is likely to be used all the time. The goal is to develop a hearing aid that can adaptively change its parameters to address the problems above, and will be accomplished with a novel fitting approach that rapidly presents a number of parameter settings to the user and lets the user guide the system toward the optimal settings for each listening situation. This requires the development of machine-learning algorithms to effectively search the parameter space and user interface devices and instructions that are easy for the patient to use. The focus of this Phase I proposal is the development of the algorithms and the adaptive user-driven fitting program, and to compare the proposed fitting with the traditional audiogram-based fitting across measures of functional hearing (ability to recognize speech in noise) and subjective preference."
"9171724","Project Summary/Abstract  We have recently discovered that rat, mouse, and human dopamine transporters (DATs) are modified by palmitoylation, the covalent attachment of palmitic acid. This is the first demonstration of lipid modification for DAT or related neurotransmitter transporters, and significantly impacts our view of transport regulatory mechanisms. Palmitoylation is reversible and dynamic, conferring the ability of proteins to respond to physiologic signals and participate in regulatory processes in a manner analogous to phosphorylation. Our preliminary studies indicate that palmitoylation strongly regulates dopamine (DA) transport capacity and opposes DAT degradation. These novel findings suggest that palmitoylation has high potential to impact dopaminergic signaling in both short- and long-term manners that may be relevant to dopaminergic dysregulation in drug abuse and neurologic disease states. Preliminary studies indicate that methamphetamine can modulate DAT palmitoylation in rats, which may impact acute and chronic regulation of the transporter. In addition, we have identified two palmitoylation sites in rat DAT, with early results consistent with different functions attributable to modification of the different sites. Many major questions related to DAT palmitoylation remain to be addressed. At the most basic level these include characterizing psychostimulant drug effects on DAT palmitoylation in vivo and determining functions associated with each of the palmitoylation sites identified, for both rat and human transporters. Our long-term goal is to understand the regulatory processes involved in modulating DAT activity and to establish causative links in dysfunction of these processes to human neurological disorders and drug abuse. The objective of this proposal is to perform fundamental analyses of the role of palmitoylation in modulation of rat DAT function that will lay the groundwork for future studies relevant to understanding DAT activity in normal and pathophysiologic conditions. Our central working hypothesis is that palmitoylation of DAT increases DA transport kinetics and decreases DAT degradation, thereby functioning as a mechanism that would lead to increased DAT transport capacity. To test this hypothesis we propose two specific aims: 1) Assessment of transporter function associated with individual palmitoylation sites; and 2) Assessment of acute psychostimulant drug treatments on the DAT palmitoylation state. For the first aim we will employ site-directed mutagenesis to generate single or double palmitoylation site mutants and analyze each for DAT function and regulation. For the second aim we will treat rats with psychostimulant drugs and measure the time-course and duration of changes in DAT palmitoylation and DA uptake capacity. This significant research will be performed by undergraduate and graduate students and is expected to substantially advance our understanding of the role of this previously unknown lipid modification on DAT function, and may provide insights into dysregulation of DAT activities leading to dopaminergic disease or drug abuse."
"9337241","Osteoarthritis (OA), the most common form of arthritis, is a joint disease characterized by the degradation of articular cartilage. This disease is complex and dynamic, evolving over years or even decades to ultimately cause joint pain and dysfunction. OA affects over 27 million adults in the US, making it a leading cause of disability. Despite being the most common cause of disability in western nations, OA has no cure and few options for diagnosis or treatment. In the search for a treatment, the most critical knowledge gap involves understanding the pathogenesis of OA prior to converging on the late-stage disease state, which is characterized by pain, deformity, and dysfunction. Indeed, the current standard of diagnosis by late-stage radiographic changes and eventual treatment via arthroplasty has proven to be a ?solution? that is far from ideal. Cracks in cartilage (i.e. breaks in the matrix) have strong potential to be one such early marker of pre-OA and increased OA risk. Cracks are often observed after joint trauma as well as in late-stage disease. Indeed, cracks are often considered when grading and classifying cartilage damage and OA progression. Recent basic-science studies have defined crack prevalence and morphology, mechanical thresholds for crack initiation, and bio-physiological changes after cracking. However, to be developed as a marker for pre-OA or to guide clinical decision-making, key questions about cracks must be answered. These questions range from basic-science research to clinical application. This proposal outlines two basic-science questions that enhance the fundamental understanding of the mechanical and biological consequences of cracks in cartilage and, in so doing, begin to test cracks as an important orthopedic biomarker. Specifically, it is unknown if existing cracks destabilize cartilage or predispose it to further biological degradation. Broadly, the applicants hypothesize that crack morphology can be used to distinguish between cracks that are benign verses cracks that indicate irrevocably damage cartilage. In this study, the applicants more specifically hypothesize that, when loaded above a threshold, cracks in cartilage will grow and induce peracute cellular deterioration. To address these knowledge gaps, this proposal has two specific aims: (1) Investigate the mechanical stability of cracks in cartilage and (2) Characterize the acute biological consequences of cracks in cartilage."
"9408382","PROJECT SUMMARY  With 37 million people living with HIV/AIDS (including 1.2 million in the US), and 1.1 million AIDS-related deaths in 2015, HIV/AIDS remains a formidable global epidemic (UNAIDS, CDC). Modern HIV therapy combines drugs from different classes to form ?cocktail? therapies that have transformed HIV into a manageable chronic infection for many individuals. Despite the effectiveness of these drugs, side effects and drug resistance remain serious concerns for these life-long therapies. Thus, there is an enduring need for novel HIV inhibitors with new mechanisms of action and stronger barriers to resistance. Furthermore, it is recognized that lack of patient compliance is a major factor leading to treatment failure. For this reason, HIV specialists are excited by the prospect of long-acting therapies, and a cocktail of such therapies would provide a revolutionary new treatment option for many HIV patients.  Navigen is a small pharmaceutical company targeting infectious diseases through an innovative discovery and design process. We have identified a novel HIV entry inhibitor, cholesterol-PIE12-trimer (CPT31), that is a protease-resistant D-peptide (peptide made from D-amino acids) that targets HIV's conserved entry machinery. With highly potent activity against all major HIV subtypes and designed barriers to resistance, our anti-HIV D- peptide overcomes the current limitations of the entry inhibitor treatment class. In addition, CPT31 is ideal for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) since it blocks the first stage of the viral lifecycle prior to infection of target cells. CPT31 is currently in late preclinical development at Navigen.  CPT31's uniquely conserved target, superior resistance profile, high potency, protease resistance, and favorable pharmacokinetic (PK) and physicochemical properties make it an ideal candidate for extended- release depot formulation. Via a one-year R56 bridge grant, we have worked with an industry-leading formulation group at Oakwood Labs to demonstrate the feasibility of developing a long-acting formulation of CPT31 (CPT31-LA) suitable for once-monthly injection. Optimization of CPT31-LA is currently underway. In this three-year grant application, using optimized CPT31-LA, we will perform 1) required activities for scale-up and manufacturing in preparation for clinical trials, 2) rat and non-human primate (NHP) PK studies, 3) rat toxicology studies, and 4) NHP prevention (PrEP) and therapeutic efficacy studies. These studies will greatly facilitate development partnerships to advance CPT31-LA through IND filing and clinical trials. Once-monthly CPT31-LA will provide a potentially transformative new option for the prevention and treatment of HIV."
"9319152","The link between intestinal inflammation and spondyloarthritis (SpA) has long been recognized. Likewise, the  role for intestinal microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is well appreciated, and a similar role in  SpA is emerging. It is unknown, however, whether the contents of the flora are abnormal in SpA patients  (dysbiosis), or whether the immunologic response to an otherwise normal flora mediates intestinal  inflammation. Data in both IBD and SpA suggest a role for dysregulated adaptive immunity in the  pathogenesis of both diseases, and there is also evidence supporting dysbiosis in the pathogenesis of IBD.  Therefore, we predict that SpA patients will have an abnormal adaptive (B and T cell) immune response to a  limited set of bacterial antigens and will additionally demonstrate abnormal fecal flora contents. Both of these  hypotheses will be tested in this proposal. In Aim 1, we will identify humoral immunologic targets to enteric  antigens using a novel antigen microarray followed by targeted screening of select bacteria. In Aim 2, we will  evaluate for abnormal floral content through 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing followed by metagenome  sequencing of the enteric microflora of children and adults with SpA. In Aim 3, we will perform T cell  functional studies and analysis of T cell receptor (TCR) oligoclonality before and after exposure to potential  target antigens. All of these aims are inter-connected, as bacterial antigens identified in Aim 2 will be studied  in Aims 1 and 3, and B cell targets identified in Aim 1 will also be studied in Aim 3. These studies will help to  establish a role for an altered adaptive lymphocyte response to intestinal bacteria in SpA patients (compared  to control subjects), as well as explore a potential role for an altered gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of  SpA. The outcome of these studies will be the identification of a limited set of bacterial antigens associated  with and potentially causative of the disease, as well as identifying a role for the adaptive immune response  in SpA. Thus, this research will provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of SpA as well as suggest  potential new biomarkers useful for diagnosis and monitoring of the disease, and even targets of therapy as  we learn to manipulate the microbiota and/or the adaptive immune response to the microbiota."
"9208439","PROJECT 3 SUMMARY Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ?-herpesvirus infecting 44-100% of the population and remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in solid organ transplant (SOT) and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (SCT) recipients. Infection in SCT patients is often associated with myelosuppression and graft failure due to virus reactivation from latency, but the associated mechanisms are still largely unknown. HCMV encodes multiple latency-associated gene products including the chemokine receptor US28, which binds CC- chemokines as well as the CX3C-chmokine Fractalkine. US28 signals in both ligand-independent and ligand- dependent manners, but the downstream signaling pathways and consequences are unique for each. Importantly, herein we demonstrate that US28 is required for latency and/or reactivation in both in vitro CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) as well as in a humanized mouse model. In addition, we show that US28 is sufficient to promote CD34+ HPC differentiation into myeloid lineage cells. Therefore, based upon our exciting new findings, we hypothesize that US28 ligand-independent signaling during latency helps to maintain latency and that ligand-specific signaling promotes CD34+ HPC differentiation into a reactivation/replication competent myeloid lineage cell to ensure virus replication under appropriate conditions including inflammation. US28 signaling may also contribute to other aspects of latency by acting as a biosensor to promote migration towards inflammatory chemokines, and possibly by increasing immediate early gene expression during reactivation. Defining the role of US28 in latency and reactivation, determining how US28 signaling intersects with EGFR signaling, and understanding how US28 signaling influences other HCMV proteins (Projects 1 and 4) and miRNAs (Project 2) expressed during latency and manipulating EGFR signaling (Project 5) are the goals of this proposal. We propose the following specific aims: 1) To determine how US28 signaling in CD34+ HPCs intersects with EGFR signaling pathways using a multi-omics approach; 2) To determine what molecular characteristics of US28 mediate HCMV latency and reactivation using both in vitro CD34+ HPCs and in vivo humanized BLT mouse models; 3) To determine what US28 signaling pathways promote CD34+ HPC hematopoiesis also using both in vitro CD34+ HPC and in vivo huBLT models. Results of this study will generate new virus latency and reactivation paradigms promoting the development of novel therapies to prevent virus reactivation and to treat HCMV-mediated myelosuppression."
"9208433","OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of our program is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of HCMV regulation of host signaling in the establishment and maintenance of viral latency and reactivation, and determine how viral dysregulation of CD34+ Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells (HPCs) signaling may compromise hematopoiesis. HCMV remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality after Solid Organ Transplantation (SOT) and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT), and myelosuppression is a common clinical manifestation of HCMV infection in these patients. HPCs represent a critical reservoir of latent HCMV in the transplant recipient, thereby providing a source of virus for dissemination to visceral organs. Preliminary data from our group using an in vitro CD34+ HPC model and mice engrafted with human fetal bone marrow, liver and thymus (huBLT mice) have shown that HCMV regulation of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and downstream signaling in CD34+ HPCs is essential for viral latency and reactivation as well as hematopoiesis. Our group has shown that multiple HCMV genes expressed in latently infected CD34+ HPCs including the UL133-138 locus, US28, UL7 and HCMV miRNAs target multiple signaling pathways activated by EGFR to control viral latency/reactivation and hematopoiesis. We hypothesize that HCMV fine tunes the activity of EGFR and its downstream pathways to balance states of viral latency and reactivation. We also hypothesize that HCMV fine tunes signaling and cytokine secretion to impact hematopoiesis. Further, we propose that this regulation meets antagonistic needs to promote dissemination but limit broad hematopoietic differentiation to control reactivation. This program project will test each of these hypotheses using the in vitro CD34+ HPC model in combination with the huBLT mouse model and samples from SOT and HSCT patients. The complexity of signaling events and approaches to comprehensively address questions on viral latency and hematopoiesis can only be achieved through a collaborative effort under a PPG mechanism.

Hsp70 is considered a triage chaperone because it is important in protein folding, while it also blocks aggregation and targets misfolded proteins for degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) and the chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) pathway. How does Hsp70 decide if a protein can be folded? What molecular and structural mechanisms link Hsp70 to the various fates of its protein substrates? These questions are essential to our understanding of how cells maintain protein homeostasis (i.e. proteostasis). Based on the findings obtained in the first funding cycle (2008-present), we have developed a model in which the dwell time of a substrate in the Hsp70 complex might be one factor that contributes to whether a protein is ultimately folded or degraded. This model emerged from experiments in which we used high throughput screening (HTS) to uncover new chemical probes that tune the ATPase activity of Hsp70. Using these molecules, we showed that inhibiting ATP turnover favored degradation of multiple Hsp70 substrates, such as tau and polyglutamine (polyQ) expanded huntingtin (polyQ-Htt) and androgen receptor (polyQ-AR), while stimulating activity led to substrate accumulation and proteotoxicity. Because ATP turnover in Hsp70 is allosterically linked to substrate affinity, we now hypothesize that prolonged interactions with Hsp70 may be a molecular trigger that favors recruitment of UPS components. In the proposed work, we will explore this idea in the following specific aims: (1) develop a suite of chemical probes and point mutants that trap Hsp70 in either its tight or loose affinity forms, (2) explore the role of substrate affinity in stabilization of te unfolded model proteins, tau and polyQ-Htt, and (3) understand how Hsp70 discriminates between normal AR and misfolded, polyQ-AR. From these studies, we expect to better understand how Hsp70 makes key triage decisions. This study is significant because Hsp70 has been linked to many protein-misfolding diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders. Thus, the proposed studies will clarify the logic of Hsp70-mediated PQC and, perhaps, suggest new methods for treating these diseases. This work is innovative because we will use a comprehensive chemical biology approach, combining new chemical probes with point mutants and cell-based models of disease to explore fundamental mechanisms of PQC."
"9547191","To provide support to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), CDC for audiometry testing and related questions on hearing loss and noise exposure in  adults ages 20 to 69 years in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for data collection years 2015?2016. The study collects pure-tone, air conduction hearing thresholds at .5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 kHz in each ear separately, as well as otoscopic exams, tympanometry, and acoustic reflexes on representative samples of the non-institutionalized U.S. population in sound-treated booths meeting recommended ANSI standards. Questionnaire information about tinnitus (frequency and degree of burden), use of hearing aids and other assistive devices, as well as exposure to firearms or other sources of loud noise are collected in home interviews prior to the subjects? visit to the mobile exam centers (MECs) for audiometric exams. A similar hearing component was part of earlier NHANES, 1999?2004, and NHANES 2011?2012 conducted on a representative samples of U.S. adults, ages 20 to 69 years. One of the Healthy People 2010 goals is to assess (with the goal of reducing) noise-induced hearing loss in adults. For this purpose, audiograms are examined and ?notches? identified in the higher frequency ranges at 3, 4, or 6 kHz as a surrogate marker of noise exposure. Computer algorithms to identify the notches have been developed. The NHANES, 1999?2004, data serve as a baseline, but to assess progress on this goal in Healthy People 2020, hearing thresholds of U.S. adults must be measured again in NHANES. NCHS directs the data collection contractor (i.e., WESTAT) in establishing and revising protocols for the hearing component and in preparing training and field manuals. NCHS provides NIDCD with an opportunity to collaboratively review summary data for purposes of quality control during the data collection period and, also, provides NIDCD with a data file for quality review approximately three months before the Public Use data release."
"9384460","PROJECT SUMMARY This K01 will provide the applicant with training in support of becoming an independent, interdisciplinary researcher on the interplay among children?s biologically-informed genetic predispositions for behavioral disinhibition (impulsivity, sensation seeking, externalizing), negative family environments, and family-based prevention effects in pathways to early adolescent substance use. The applicant will accomplish this objective through (1) developing expertise in advanced genomic (e.g., genome-wide associations and meta-analysis) and bioinformatics methods (e.g., functional annotation, pathway and gene-network analyses) to create biologically-informed markers of genetic predisposition; and (2) gaining an interdisciplinary understanding of adolescent substance use across genetic, familial, and prevention domains. These goals will be accomplished through genomics and bioinformatics workshops, formal coursework in bioinformatics and substance use, and mentored instruction (including directed readings and supervised research experiences). Instruction will be complemented by professional development seminars, grant writing workshops, and training in the responsible conduct of research. Training will be accomplished at Arizona State University?s (ASU?s) School of Social and Family Dynamics and REACH Institute, with primary mentorship from Dr. Thomas Dishion (expert in family- based prevention of adolescent substance use). Co-mentorship will be provided by Dr. Laurie Chassin (expert in substance use etiology), Dr. Kathryn Lemery-Chalfant (expert in gene-environment interplay), and Dr. Valentin Dinu (expert in bioinformatics and genomics), and collaboration with Dr. Arpana Agrawal (expert in advanced genetic methods in substance use) and Dr. David MacKinnon (expert in causal mediation analyses). The first aim is to examine if biologically-informed genetic predispositions for behavioral disinhibition evoke and/or moderate negative family environments in predicting early adolescent substance use. It is hypothesized that genetic predisposition will be moderated by and evoke negative family environments, which will contribute to early adolescent substance use. The second aim is to examine if family-based prevention effects moderate genetic predispositions for behavioral disinhibition?or moderate genetically evoked negative family environments?in predicting early adolescent substance use. It is hypothesized that genetic predisposition will be moderated by prevention effects in predicting early adolescent substance use and that prevention effects will buffer the genetic evocation of negative family environments. Aims will be tested in the Early Steps (age 2? 15.5) and Project Alliance 1 (age 11?27) samples, which are large, genetically-sensitive longitudinal studies of familial and family-based prevention effects on adolescent substance use. Training in bioinformatics methods will be used to refine and create measures of biologically-informed genetic predisposition to examine gene- environment interplay. These training and research objectives address NIDA?s strategic plan to investigate gene-environment interplay in adolescent substance use and inform next generation interventions."

"9412009","PROJECT SUMMARY In response to RFA-DA-17-014, HIV, HCV and Related Comorbidities in Rural Communities Affected by Opioid Injection Drug Epidemics in the United States: Building Systems for Prevention, Treatment and Control (UG3/UH3), we propose a multi-phase, mixed-methods study that aims to implement and evaluate a novel community response model, which we have named the Community-Based, Client-Centered Prevention Home. Using the organizational infrastructure of a large, multi-site syringe service program serving a geographically disperse population of people who inject drugs in rural communities across Northern Wisconsin, we will build locally responsive systems to facilitate uptake of evidence-based prevention services for high-risk clients. The Client-Centered Prevention Home model incorporates prevention case management and mobile health information technology into traditional harm-reduction services delivered at syringe service programs, which we hypothesize will increase use prevention services. During the UG3 phase, we will perform needs assessments in 6 rural Wisconsin counties in partnership with local stakeholders, and use respondent driven sampling to conduct a cross-sectional epidemiologic evaluation to estimate the prevalence of HIV, viral hepatitis and sexually transmitted infections. Contingent upon meeting recruitment and data collection goals, in the UH3 phase of the project we will deploy and evaluate the Client-Centered Prevention Home model in the 3 counties demonstrating highest vulnerability to worsening epidemics of opioid injection. The 3 remaining counties not selected for implementation will serve as comparison sites in a quantitative evaluation of program effectiveness during year 5. The growing problem of opioid injection in rural Wisconsin is highly significant because it exemplifies trends observed nationally indicating severe vulnerability to worsening epidemics of HIV, HCV, and opioid overdose deaths in rural communities that are substantially underserved by evidence-based prevention interventions. This proposal is highly innovative because it will be the first study to use an evidence-based mHealth strategy and a formal implementation science approach to enhance coordination of prevention services in syringe service programs. It has potential for high impact because of our team's state-wide reach, broad access to at-risk individuals, and robust infrastructure for conducting a rigorous, multi-site evaluation of our proposed model."

"9367484","Redox active first row transition metals such as iron and copper have been implicated in the pathophysiology of amyliodogenic diseases; these correlations are poorly understood at the level of mechanism. We also have limited understanding of the physiologic role for which the amyloid precursor protein (APP) has been selected. However, the fact that the APP transcript contains an iron response binding protein (IRBP) stem-loop structure and like ferritin, APP protein synthesis directly correlates with cell iron content indicating that APP is part of the ?iron regulon.? This iron regulation of APP remains an unknown with respect to both iron metabolism and amyloidogenesis; here we propose to test a specific premise with respect to a physiologic function of APP and its secretase-dependent products. First, published work from our lab provides a clue as to the connection between APP and iron metabolism. We have identified a unique function exhibited by a 22-amino acid residue peptide element at the N-terminus of the BC helical bundle contained in the E2 domain in APP. Using recombinant ?B?C or a synthetic peptide (residues 327-348 within ?B?C), we show that this sequence tethers APP to and stabilizes ferroportin (Fpn) in the plasma membrane. Fpn is the sole mammalian iron exporter; by stabilizing Fpn in the PM, sAPP stimulates cell iron-efflux. We have designated this species FTP for Ferroportin Targeting Peptide. In binding to Fpn, sAPP/FTP acts as antagonist of the key regulator of Fpn function, hepcidin (Hepc) indicating that sAPP is a key regulator of iron efflux from any mammalian cell that expresses this amyliodogenic protein or shares an interstitial space that includes another cell type that does. Although the effect of sAPP on Fpn plasma membrane display is now established, the molecular basis of this activity and its physiologic function remain significant unknowns, significant because of: 1) the key role APP and its products play in Alzheimer's disease and in cerebral amyloid angiopathy, CAA; 2) the implied role that iron plays in this neurodegenerative disorder; and 3) the potential that FTP or its synthetic congeners may have as (a) pharmacologic regulator of iron metabolism. The key element of this Application is our blood-brain barrier transwell model system composed of brain capillary endothelial cells, astrocytes and neurons, i.e, the cells of the neurovascular unit. Our premise is that: 1) iron regulates the expression of APP so as to modulate the level of iron in the brain's abluminal space; 2) iron also modulates the processing of APP to Aß; and 3) Aß in turn serves as an iron scavenger and by this mechanism is cytoprotective. We will test this premise by a combination of biophysical structure-function, cell biologic and genetic approaches including the use of primary cells cultured from strategically chosen mice KO lines. This research plan will: 1) provide novel insight into the mechanism of the Fpn/APP interaction and its role in cellular trafficking of iron; 2) test our premise that mismanagement of this iron leads to increased permeability in our BBB model; and 3) test our premise that Aß is a key player in preventing this capillary leakage by suppressing iron's activity as a potent pro-oxidant."
"9291397","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term objective of this research is a prophylactic approach that can reduce the incidence of falls and the resulting injuries among older adults at risk and thus reduce its escalating medical cost. This project explores perturbation training through the use of treadmill device and a motor learning approach, in which experience with slip-like perturbation generated by that treadmill is used to prepare the motor system to develop and then put to use fall-resisting skills outside of training environment (cross-environment transfer). The computer-controlled treadmill is portable, safe and easy to operate, thus conducive for use in clinics or community centers. The study logically builds on and complements the team's previous and current research programs, and will further test that after such a single session, older adults at risk can retain such cross- environment transfer and reduce their likelihood of falls in everyday living for the next 6 to 12 months. Finally, the study will explore that such reduction of falls does not come merely from these persons' familiarity with the training or testing setup, protocol and environments."

"9334844","ABSTRACT Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder with profound consequences to families and the health care infrastructure. Notably, SCD can trigger nephropathy leading to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with poor outcomes and no effective treatment. SCD-dependent susceptibility to ESRD is influenced by genetic factors. We demonstrated previously that MYH9 and APOL1, two loci in close physical proximity on chromosome 22, are independent predictors of proteinuria in SCD. This region, particularly two major risk alleles (named G1 and G2), has been replicated widely in non-SCD nephropathy. However, conflicting studies have suggested that alleles in either APOL1 or MYH9 might contribute to the pathology through an as yet unclear mechanism. Recently, we employed in vivo studies to understand the contribution of this locus to ESRD. We discovered a role for APOL1 in the developing zebrafish kidney and uncovered a complex genetic architecture, wherein the APOL1 G1 risk allele is a functional null while the G2 risk allele exerts a dominant negative effect. Critically, we also found that APOL1 and MYH9 interact genetically, in the context of anemic stress, potentially reconciling diverse observations about the roles of each gene in ESRD. These advances afford us the opportunity to probe key questions in the field, including: the spatiotemporal context involved in the pathology; the underlying cellular mechanisms and pathways that could be targeted for therapeutic intervention; and the extent to which other genetic factors contribute the SCD nephropathy. Equipped with potent, multidisciplinary working tools, including zebrafish mutants that recapitulate an experimentally tractable, physiologically relevant in vivo pathology, we propose three Aims. First, to examine the cellular pathology of the APOL1/MYH9 locus we will investigate the altered transcriptional networks in multiple relevant cell types in our APOL1 zebrafish models. Through this method, we will be able to query both suggested pathways, such as autophagy and altered chloride channel functionality and discover new ones in an unbiased fashion. Second, the absence of mechanistic knowledge in SCD nephropathy has limited therapeutic options. Although angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) appear to reduce albuminuria and are used widely, their efficacy in the context of APOL1 and SCD nephropathies remains unproven. We will screen our relevant APOL1 in vivo models for FDA-approved lead therapeutic compounds that could be transitioned rapidly into the clinical arena. Finally, although APOL1 and MYH9 convey critical risk for SCD nephropathy, there is clear evidence for additional genetic risk factors, the identification of which will likely inform pathomechanism. We will leverage our large SCD nephropathy cohort and our in vivo tools to identify additional susceptibility loci and, thus, provide potentially orthogonal entry points into the biology of this phenotype. Taken together, our studies will inform the pathomechanism underpinned by the MYH9/APOL1 locus, identify new drivers for SCD nephropathy and offer an exciting opportunity to identify lead compounds that will have both investigative and therapeutic potential."
"9323835","PROJECT SUMMARY Converging evidence indicates that the presence of midlife vascular risk factors (e.g. hypertension and diabetes) accelerates brain aging and increases the risk of dementia in late life. Conversely, midlife physical activity is associated with the reduced risk of dementia in late life. The potential benefits of regular aerobic exercise on neurocognitive function have been demonstrated in older adults; however, no interventional study has investigated such effects in middle-aged adults. Therefore, the overarching goal of this project is to determine the effects of regular aerobic exercise on neurocognitive function (primary outcome) as well as brain neuronal plasticity and cerebrovascular function (secondary outcomes) in middle-aged adults with subclinical cardiovascular risk factors (i.e. prehypertension and prediabetes). We will address the following aims. Aim 1: Determine the effect of regular aerobic exercise on neurocognitive function. Hypothesis: Regular aerobic exercise improves fluid cognitive performance. Aim 2: Determine the effect of regular aerobic exercise on brain plasticity. Hypothesis: Regular aerobic exercise increases prefrontal and hippocampal volumes, white matter fiber integrity in the anterior corpus callosum, and functional connectivity of the default-mode-network. Aim 3: Determine the impact of regular aerobic exercise on brain perfusion and its relation to neurocognitive function and brain plasticity. Hypotheses: 1) Regular aerobic exercise increases regional brain perfusion while attenuating cerebral blood flow (CBF) pulsatility in the large cerebral arteries; 2) The exercise-related changes in brain perfusion and CBF pulsatility mediate changes in neurocognitive function and brain plasticity. To address our aims, we will conduct 1) a cross-sectional study which compares endurance-trained adults with sedentary subjects with subclinical cardiovascular risk factors and 2) an interventional study in which those sedentary subjects undergo a 1-year program of aerobic exercise training or stretching. Cognitive function will be assessed using the NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery complemented with sensitive neuropsychological testing on attention-executive function, episodic and working memory, and processing speed. Neuroimaging biomarkers of brain structure and function will be acquired by MRI. Brain perfusion and CBF pulsatility will be measured by arterial spin labeling, 2D time-resolved phase- contrast MRI, and transcranial Doppler. Successful accomplishment of this project will provide the urgently needed knowledge whether regular aerobic exercise improves neurocognitive function in middle-aged individuals who have high risks of developing cognitive decline and dementia in late life."
"9503998","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is an application for renewal of a longstanding program to provide intensive training in modern methods of nephrologic research to clinically trained individuals with the M.D. or M.D./Ph.D. degree. Continued funding of seven stipends per year is requested for this joint training program that provides support for both adult and pediatric nephrology fellows. Although the highest priority of this program is to train physician-scientists, basic scientist trainees with the Ph.D. degree who are strongly committed to careers in kidney research are also supported whenever possible. Each year 3-4 new trainees are recruited into the program after completing residency training in internal medicine or pediatrics. Only fellows with a strong commitment to multi-year research training are recruited into the program. Training is provided in both laboratory-based and patient-oriented research. The training faculty is drawn from multiple clinical and basic science departments (Internal Medicine, Pediatrics, Biomedical Engineering, Cellular and Molecular Physiology, Cell Biology, Epidemiology and Public Health, Genetics, Immunobiology, Pathology, Pharmacology) and spans diverse biomedical disciplines relevant to kidney disease research (electrolyte physiology and pathophysiology, cell biology and experimental pathology, genetics and developmental biology, immunology and transplantation, vascular biology, tissue engineering, and clinical epidemiology and biostatistics). Although the core of research training is provided through work on a selected research topic under the supervision of an individual preceptor, training is enhanced by a broad array of teaching conferences, seminars and courses. Indeed, many recent fellows have enrolled in graduate degree programs specifically designed for training clinician investigators including the Investigative Medicine Ph.D. program, and the Program in Chronic Disease Epidemiology that leads to a Master of Science in Epidemiology and Public Health. Over the past 35 years this program has trained many leaders in academic nephrology, and the recent track record continues to be outstanding. The overwhelming majority of trainees who completed training during the past 10 years currently hold either full-time academic positions or research-related positions in industry, and many have successfully competed for career development faculty grants from the NIH or American Heart Association (e.g. K08, K23, Fellow-to-Faculty Transition Award) or have already obtained NIH R01 grants. The program also has made progress in achieving ethnic diversity, as four current fellows are underrepresented minority trainees."
"9392658","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a significant health problem in the United States. Compared to European Americans (EA), the incidence of HCC is higher in African Americans (AA) and is associated with more advanced tumor stage at diagnosis and lower survival rates. It has been reported that the sensitivity of ?- fetoprotein (AFP) for the diagnosis of HCC in African Americans with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is lower than that of patients of all other racial groups combined. We previously performed preliminary investigation into racial disparities through metabolomics profiling of sera from HCC cases and patients with liver cirrhosis by using both liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Through stratified analysis of the LC/GC-MS data, we identified different candidates that distinguish HCC cases from the cirrhotic controls among AA and EA. This application builds on these promising preliminary results to find and validate race-specific metabolites as biomarkers for HCC. This will be accomplished by targeted analysis of metabolites in liver tissues and sera from HCC cases and patients with liver cirrhosis representing AA and EA. Metabolites that differentiate HCC cases from cirrhotic controls in a race-specific manner will be selected by statistical and network-based methods. Then, a systems-oriented approach that combines these metabolites with other candidate biomarkers (genes, glycans, and proteins) will be utilized for the selection of key signaling pathways perturbed in HCC. Following validation of the candidates via independent samples from HCC cases, patients with liver cirrhosis, and healthy subjects, we will elucidate their functional roles through both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Successful completion of this research will enable us to identify HCC biomarkers and perturbed pathways that are race-specific as well as those that are shared by AA and EA. These findings will contribute not only to a greater understanding of racial disparities in HCC but also to improving diagnosis of HCC through race-specific biomarkers."

"9543172","Project Summary Rejection remains a major hurdle to long-term transplant survival. In fact, from a clinical standpoint current immunosuppression protocols are fantastic in short-term transplant survival, but do little in promoting long- term graft outcomes. Thus, there is a pressing need now to unravel effector programs that may develop under broad immunosuppression conditions that can mediate graft loss. We recently discovered that unlike other Th subsets, Th9 cells are prominently induced under unusual circumstances in that they may be especially relevant to graft loss in immunosuppressed hosts. They are best induced when the default Th1/Th2 programs are inhibited (immunosuppression), and require OX40-induced formation of super enhancers at Il9 locus (not specific transcription factors), and induction of Th9 cells is often at the cost of Foxp3+ Tregs. Based on the unexpected potency of OX40 in Th9 induction, as well as the unexpected mode of actions of OX40 stimulation, we propose and test a unifying hypothesis in this proposal, namely- suppression of the default T cell programs in an immunosuppressive milieu allows OX40 the opportunity to support alternative Th9 programs in triggering rejection of otherwise tolerant grafts. We propose 3 Aims in this proposal. Aim 1 focuses on identifying novel mechanisms by which OX40 promotes massive Th9 cells, examining formation, structure, and activities of super enhancers at Il9 locus. Aim 2 investigates how OX40 redirects Foxp3+ Tregs to Th9 cells, focusing on the newly identified Foxp3 repressors in shutting down Foxp3 expression and whether Foxp3 may disrupt IL-9 super enhancer formation. Aim 3 examines the impact of Th9 cells in transplant survival, testing whether Th9 cells mediate graft loss under tolerizing therapies. We believe that the proposed studies will unravel new mechanisms of graft injury in tolerizing hosts and findings from these studies will have broad impacts on other immune-mediated diseases as well, including cancer immunotherapies and autoimmune diseases."
"9323679","Project Summary/Abstract The commensal bacteria that colonize the neonatal gastrointestinal tract may exert long lasting effects on the immune system, as alterations in the neonatal microbiota have been associated with the development of diseases later in life such as asthma, allergy, or inflammatory bowel disease. However, little is known about the antigen-specific immune response to neonatal commensal bacteria. The premise of this grant, therefore, is that determining the initial antigen-specific T and B cell response to commensal bacteria is fundamental to understanding how neonatal commensal bacteria may exert long-lasting effects on the immune system. Here, we will leverage our experience with TCR repertoires and commensal bacterial reactivity in adult mice to characterize to T cell response in neonates (Aim 1). We will also examine the role of maternal IgA and how it affects the early T and B cell response (Aim 2). Finally, we will ask whether these early adaptive responses are disrupted by ante-partum antibiotics or neonatal infections, potentially setting the stage for abnormal mucosal immune homeostasis (Aim 3). Thus, these data will generate a deeper understanding of the antigen-specific neonatal immune response and its unique role in the ontogeny of the immune system."

With regard to the latter, it is known that there are still substantial technical innovations needed to make ultrahigh- field MRI routine, stable and consistently superior to the best available clinical MRI systems, in all parts of the body. The technical challenges related to gradient, shim and RF performance, decreased B0 and B1 homogeneity, and increased RF power deposition are the most critical. These challenges are the basis for much of the present research activity in the UHF MRI world, and many creative solutions are being found. But one underlying principle is clear: solving these problems will demand innovation in the design, implementation and application of high-performance hardware sub-subsystems. It is also clear that even at field strengths lower than 7T, many improvements in image quality would be enabled through novel hardware development. From the Human Connectome Project comes a clear demand for increased gradient performance, which is needed both for more efficient diffusion encoding and for faster and higher resolution spatial encoding. Yet body-size gradients have now reached hard amplitude and slew rate limits set by human peripheral nerve stimulation thresholds, and therefore any further increases in gradient performance will require innovation in smaller size gradient coils, most obviously head-size gradients. Along with the demands for better gradients come new requirements for better B0 shimming and B1 / radio frequency performance. In this TRD project, we will pursue projects involving major hardware design, construction and analysis in all three of these principal hardware subsystems of the MR scanner."
"9324847","Abstract: Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention Program (CEPP)  The overarching goal of the Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention Program (CEPP) is to reduce cancer  incidence and mortality at a population level. The CEPP has two specific aims: 1) to identify and characterize  novel causal factors for cancer; and 2) to develop and evaluate novel methods for primary and secondary  cancer prevention. The CEPP pursues their research objectives through the efforts of two interacting groups of  investigators: the Cancer Epidemiology Group and the Cancer Prevention Group. Research themes within the  Cancer Epidemiology Group include: 1) environmental exposure and cancer risk; 2) hormonal factors and  inflammation biomarkers and cancer; and 3) genetically determined factors and cancer susceptibility. Research  themes within the Cancer Prevention Group include: 1) evaluation and validation of cancer preventive  strategies; and 2) identification and evaluation of circulating biomarkers for early cancer detection.  Collaborating with investigators from basic and clinical sciences, both groups maintain a translational focus by  working in population settings and generating new knowledge with direct and immediate relevance to human  applications. The CEPP currently has 19 members from 5 departments in 2 schools of the University of  Pittsburgh. These investigators receive $5.7 M annually in total direct funding, including $4.4 M from the NCI  and $1.1 M from other peer-reviewed sources. All CEPP members are engaged in cancer research that  focuses on the discovery and validation of novel risk factors or protective agents for cancer. Between January  2010 and April 2014, CEPP members published 430 papers including high-impact publications in NEJM,  Science, JAMA, JNCI, JCO and Lancet Oncology. Of these 23% resulted from intra-programmatic and 30%  resulted from inter-programmatic collaborations. Approximately 66% of the papers represent collaborations  with external investigators. UPCI support, including Clinical Protocol and Data Management and shared  resources, specifically the Animal Facility, Biostatistics Facility, Cancer Bioinformatics Services, Cancer  Genomics Facility, Cancer Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics Facility, Cancer Proteomics Facility, Cell  and Tissue Imaging Facility, Chemical Biology Facility, Cytometry Facility, Immunological Monitoring and  Cellular Products Laboratory, In Vivo Imaging Facility, and Tissue and Research Pathology Services facilitates  and enhances CEPP research."
"9304708","The production of shale gas, and the development of wells using horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing technology, is a major driver of the U.S. economy. The process of preparing well pads to completion of the work creates a complex mixture of airborne toxicants that includes elevated concentrations of particulate mat- ter (PM), ultrafine particles (UFPs) from diesel engine exhaust (DEE), silica, as well as volatile organic com- pounds (VOCs) and polyaromatic hydrocarbons from geological, surface and anthropogenic sources. The to- tality of materials that the individuals are exposed to is alarming to federal, state and local governmental organ- izations. Indeed, communities that are proximal to unconventional natural gas development (UNGD) well sites have greater health effects compared to communities without UNGD. However, what is not known is how ac- tive UNGD precipitates these health effects. PM, specifically fine PM (<2.5 µm in diameter, PM2.5) is a known cardiovascular toxicant. Several studies have demonstrated a significant impairment in vascular, and micro- vascular function. Combined, these studies indicate significant cardiovascular health effects even at low ambi- ent levels. Moreover, we have shown cardiac mitochondrial impairment, a significant contributor to progression of heart failure, following ambient PM exposure. However, what is not known is the relative toxicity of specific sources (source apportionment) or the mechanisms of cardiovascular injury following pulmonary PM2.5 expo- sure. The long-term goal is to establish physiologic mechanisms that explain the epidemiological health pat- terns during UNGD. The objective for this R15 application is to substantially advance the scientific understand- ing of the mechanisms that link pulmonary UNGD PM2.5 to remote tissue dysfunction. The central hypothesis is that pulmonary exposure to PM2.5 collected on-site during hydraulic fracturing will have greater microvascular and mitochondrial dysfunction, characterized by disturbances in mechanisms supporting normal arteriolar con- striction, endothelium-dependent dilation, mitochondrial function, and pro-apoptotic protein expression leading to cardiac functional declines. This hypothesis will be tested by 1) identifying the mechanistic alterations in mi- crovascular and mitochondrial function during different stages of UNGD, 2) identifying the cardiac functional declines that result from microvascular and mitochondrial dysfunction. The rationale for this work is that pro- posed research will add substantially to the mechanistic insights of PM2.5-induced microvascular and mito- chondrial dysfunction, while supporting our mission to educate and prepare students. Utilizing students to test theses aims will allow the students to gain knowledge in microscopy, necropsy, anatomy, biochemistry, and microvascular and cardiovascular physiology. The research proposed is innovative because it directly deter- mines toxicity of the complete matrix of toxicants produced during three phases of UNGD. The proposed re- search is significant as it will assess cardiovascular toxicity during different phases of drilling as well as mech- anisms of dysfunction that will bridge the gap between basic science and epidemiological UNGD health effects."
"9387058","SUMMARY Successful embryonic development is dependent on the female gamete progressing correctly through meiosis. In most mammals including human, entry into meiosis and the first meiotic division occur with oocyte maturation, initiated by intrafollicular signals triggered by luteinizing hormone. The second meiotic division completes upon fertilization. Defects in meiosis I or II compromise egg quality and egg competence to form a healthy embryo. In particular, abnormal organization, positioning, stability, and function of the meiotic spindles are associated with impaired female fertility. Oocyte spindle organization and positioning are orchestrated by actin, involving a cytoplasmic meshwork and the oocyte cortex. As these structural players are being identified, there is now the need to understand the regulation of these actin-based events and, in turn, what goes wrong with dysregulation of these processes. Our analysis of actin-regulatory proteins in oocytes has identified p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4) as a key player in organization of the oocyte cortex and spindle. Since Rac1 and Cdc42 have key roles in oocytes, and PAK4 is a kinase activated by these Rho-family GTPases and known to affect both the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons, PAK4 is an ideal candidate to be the link from these GTPases to mediate crucial events in meiosis I and II. We show that oocytes express PAK4, that PAK4 is mislocalized in in vitro matured oocytes as compared to ovulated eggs. We also show that treatment of oocytes with a PAK4 inhibitor produces abnormal chromatin and spindle organization in meiosis I, and distorted cell shape and abnormal localization of several cytoskeletal cell polarity markers at metaphase II. While there is the formal possibility that this PAK4 inhibitor could affect other PAKs, PAK4 is our focus over other PAKs. The only other PAK to be detected in mouse oocytes is PAK1, but the Pak1 knockout is fertile with only subtle phenotypes, whereas PAK4 is highly enriched in oocytes, shows the aforementioned different localization in ovulated versus in vitro matured eggs, and the Pak4 null mouse is embryonic lethal. We now propose to study an oocyte-specific Pak4 conditional knockout (cKO) model, as this will be the best approach to analyze the loss of PAK4 activity in oocytes, in vivo and in vitro. In Aim 1, we will generate an oocyte-specific Pak4 cKO line by crossing the Pak4-floxed mouse line with the Zp3-Cre line. This Pak4- floxed line has been used successfully for other cKOs. Aim 1 also will assess female fertility of these PAK4 cKO mice. In Aim 2, we will analyze the phenotypes of PAK4-deficient oocytes, testing the overall hypothesis that PAK4 mediates cytoskeletal and spindle organization. We will examine ovulation, progression through meiosis in vivo and in vitro, the localizations of key proteins in oocytes, and candidate downstream pathways involving PAK4 substrates. This research will reveal the functions of this kinase that is positioned to be a key player in oocytes, and provide the foundation for future studies, including analysis of the full pathway from GTPases to actin and spindle, and of PAK4's functions at precise points in meiosis."
"9326339","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson's disease (PD) is a devastating disorder for which to date only symptomatic treatments exist. The causes remain enigmatic and thus therapeutics that halt or prevent PD are not available. The last few years have been extremely exciting due to the discovery of a novel mitochondrial quality control (mtQC) pathway by our laboratory and others. By now, this pathway links three parkinsonism associated genes, PINK1 PARKIN, and FBXO7, as well as the two major cellular dysfunctions involved in disease pathogenesis: mt dysfunction and impairment of degradation pathways. The mtQC pathway is thought to facilitate the elimination of dysfunctional organelles that would otherwise cause further cellular damage. However, (patho-) physiological relevant triggers of this pathway, particular in disease-relevant cells and in vivo are unclear.  Upon accumulation of the kinase PINK1 specifically on damaged mitochondria, Parkin is recruited to catalyze differential ubiquitinations of mitochondrial substrates. However, Parkin's enzymatic functions, its E2 co-factors, the topologies of formed ubiquitin chains and their biological roles remain enigmatic. Given the recently resolved structure of Parkin and its 'closed' auto-inhibited conformation, we suggest that Parkin is sequentially activated to unleash its ubiquitin ligase functions. We have identified select E2 enzymes that regulate Parkin's activation and its enzymatic functions, excitingly through different and opposing mechanisms. Given that several therapeutic opportunities may exist along Parkin's activation cascade, we will perform structure-function analyses of this neuroprotective protein. Further, the accumulation of misfolded proteins in mitochondria may act as a physiological stimulus for PINK1 and Parkin activation. Strikingly, the induced mt- specific unfolded protein response (mtUPR) has very recently been described as a conserved longevity mechanism. We propose to elucidate the (in-) activation mechanisms of Parkin's functions on the structural, molecular, cellular, and organismal level. Therefore, we will use cutting-edge technologies and combine computational, functional biochemical and cell-biological with genetic methods in human iPSC-derived neurons and in vivo in C. elegans. Based on preliminary data, we hypothesize that Parkin is activated through the mtUPR, is regulated by bioenergetics and integrates with conserved aging pathways. On the molecular and structural level, Parkin is controlled by post-translational modifications, conformational rearrangements and by select E2 co-enzymes. Specifically, we will 1) unravel biological and molecular mechanism that (in)-activate Parkin in health and disease; 2) determine Parkin's physiological E2 co-enzymes, their regulatory roles and contribution to PD; 3) determine Parkin's activity(ies) and their interplay with bioenergetics and aging pathways. The proposed studies are relevant to fully appreciate the biological significance and potential of Parkin-directed mitochondrial quality control for disease intervention and to uncover important mechanistic insights that will provide the basis for rationale drug design."
"9335435","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposal outlines an integrated research and career development plan for Yi-Zhou Jiang PhD to complete postdoctoral training in molecular vascular biology in the laboratory of Dr. Peter F. Davies and transition to independent research. During the K99 mentored period, I will take advanced courses in bioinformatics and epigenetics, and receive specific training in mouse genetics and management both on campus and at the Jackson Labs. Concurrently my mentor, an internal advisory committee at the University of Pennsylvania and 2 external advisors will provide one-on-one experimental training and quarterly committee review. A professional development program and individual mentoring round out the career development plan for successful transition to an independent academician during the R00 phase in preparation for R01 research. My overall research goal is to determine the role of epigenetic mechanisms in mediating endothelial phenotypes in relation to the initiation and development of atherosclerosis. I have recently discovered flow- mediated plasticity of DNA methylation in regulating endothelial gene transcription (Circ Res 2014), a newly emerging area in arterial biology and pathology (Vascul Pharmacol 2014). My review paper in Arterioscl. Thromb Vasc Biol, Endothelial epigenetics in biomechanical stress is also in press. My research proposal tests the overall hypothesis that endothelial epigenetic mechanisms sensitive to flow characteristics and hypercholesterolemia dynamically modulate endothelial phenotypes to regulate the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. I will focus on detailed epigenetic mechanisms of the important endothelial molecules KLF4 and FOXO1 specifically linked by the SIN3A co-repressor system in a longitudinal study of hypercholesterolemia in pigs, by causality studies of SIN3A in transgenic mice, and in flow studies of human endothelial cells in vitro. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that the multi-subunit epigenetic transcriptional co- repressor SIN3A regulates KLF4 and FOXO1 as a response to hemodynamic flow characteristics. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that hyperlipidemia regulates transcription factors KLF4 and FOXO1 by spatio-temporal redistribution of SIN3A co-repressor complex from LXR-targeted genes to DMR-associated KLF4 and FOXO1. Thus this proposal probes epigenetic mechanisms as a common link for spatially-defined atherogenesis."
"9296759","PROJECT SUMMARY The increasing use of electronic health records (EHRs) by cancer centers nationwide has led to the tremendous growth of repositories containing unstructured, free text notes. These notes include clinical concepts that cannot be found anywhere else in the EHR, and these concepts are needed to characterize a patient?s specific ?phenotype?. Having so much data available in electronic format provides unprecedented opportunities for advancing clinical and translational cancer research, yet many researchers do not have access to practical tools to assist with identifying and extracting the concepts from these notes. To address this problem, the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center Informatics Core developed the information retrieval tool EMERSE?electronic medical record search engine?which has achieved widespread local success in supporting hundreds of cancer studies and has led to over 120 peer-reviewed publications. EMERSE provides innovative features that enable research including visualization of results, reusable patient lists, and shareable sets of search terms (?Bundles?) that promote more reproducible searches. This project proposes to develop innovative capabilities within EMERSE and develop the infrastructure to widely disseminate EMERSE to cancer centers nationwide. The software innovations in this proposal include (1) securely networking the EMERSE instances to enable searches across cancer centers, which is important for rare cancers and is in alignment with growing national data sharing initiatives; (2) leveraging the networked EMERSE instances to share search knowledge between institutions in the form of stored search term Bundles, promoting the reproducibility of searches across sites as well as within studies; (3) supporting search with either fully identified or de-identified clinical notes, depending on the users? credentials and intended use, which is needed for cross-institutional searching; (4) supporting the inclusion of localized custom dictionaries or ontologies to be used for query expansion. The technical and collaborative infrastructure to support the widespread dissemination of EMERSE will be developed, including formation of the EMERSE Research Informatics Network (ERIN). Five cancer centers, each with varying health information technology environments, will join ERIN for this project and locally implement EMERSE, making it available to their researchers. Implementations will be staggered so that lessons learned from implementing at one site can be used to improve the documentation and be applied to future sites. Implementation details will include how to address regulatory, institutional review board, security, and compliance issues. The collective knowledge from these initial implementers will be integrated into a ?roadmap? guide to help future cancer centers and other institutions implement EMERSE with ease. EMERSE will be promoted to other cancer centers through various mechanisms. The impact and effectiveness of this work will be evaluated across multiple dimensions including information retrieval metrics, usability, implementation, adoption, satisfaction, and utility."

"9377622","Project Summary/Abstract  It is now well-recognized that cardiovascular disease (CVD) has many features of a systemic inflammatory process, and recent studies suggest that CVD can be viewed as a state of defective resolution of inflammation. Eicosanoids are diet-derived bioactive lipid metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs, e.g. omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids), and have been implicated as upstream drivers of inflammatory conditions including CVD. Eicosanoids can both promote inflammation (pro-inflammatory eicosanoids) or reverse it (anti-inflammatory eicosanoids). The balance of these pro- and anti-inflammatory eicosanoids is critical for the clinical manifestation of inflammation, and therefore are tightly regulated via cellular signaling pathways. A major gap in our knowledge is how specific eicosanoid mediators drive the CVD-associated inflammation in humans, and conversely, how other eicosanoids promote its resolution. Recent advances in high performance mass spectrometry technology now allow the accurate identification and quantification of more than 150 distinct eicosanoids and related PUFA species circulating in human plasma. The proposed study will evaluate a comprehensive panel of pro- and anti-inflammatory eicosanoids in relation to cardiovascular risk factors and clinical events, as well as assess how diet, drugs, and genetic variants modulate the delicate balance of eicosanoids. This will be conducted within two large-scale prospective clinical trials, the Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) and the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL). We will leverage banked blood specimens and collected clinical trial data from 3,550 men and women (1,275 incident CVD events) to examine eicosanoids in relation to CVD risk factors and events. In Aim1 we will focus on the JUPITER trial of participants recruited based on the presence of chronic systemic inflammation to examine the associations (cross-sectional and change over time) of pro-and anti-inflammatory eicosanoids with CVD risk factors and events, and assess changes in eicosanoid levels with high-intensity statin therapy versus placebo. In Aim 2, we will replicate the JUPITER analyses in the VITAL trial, an independent population of older healthy individuals (20% African Americans). In VITAL, we will assess eicosanoid associations with CVD risk factors and incident events, and effects of marine omega-3 fatty acid supplementation versus placebo, then we will perform meta-analysis of the JUPITER and VITAL studies. We will also assess whether the benefits of the interventions differ based on levels of eicosanoids, and how they are modulated by genetic variants in enzymes involved in eicosanoid pathways. This comprehensive approach may elucidate specific pro- and anti-inflammatory PUFA derived eicosanoids associated with CVD, and could trigger therapeutic anti-inflammatory approaches that are in line with personalized medicine."

NHEJ often results in short deletions or insertions and thus are very efficient and effective in knocking out gene function if targeted to coding regions. The Core will work with users to pin-point the region of the gene to be targeted and the strain to be used. The Core will also supply hypomorphic Pkd1 mice if the investigator wishes to quickly assess the cyst-promoting activity of a heterozygous TALEN or CRISPR-induced null on a mildly cystic `sensitized' background. The Core will also make specific custom alterations (genome edits or knock-in mutations) in the Pkd1 or Pkd2 gene, and will provide services for mutating genes that have been implicated in physically interacting with the PC1/PC2 complex. The Core will also target cell lines (including ES cells) producing matched lines with mutations for physiological cyst forming assays and electrophysiology, and will introduce tandem affinity tags (TAP) tags into the open reading frame of candidate genes to allow the candidate and interacting proteins to be isolated from the cells under physiological conditions, without overexpression. The Gene Targeting Core will work with existing cores at the University of Kansas Medical Center, including the Transgenic and Gene-Targeting Institutional Facility and the Genome Sequencing Facility."
"9387100","Project Summary/Abstract. Despite the existence of several evidence-based asthma treatments, and increased understanding of effective community-based interventions for high-risk pediatric populations, childhood asthma disparities persist. Richmond is often cited as the ?Asthma Capital? of the U.S. by the Allergy and Asthma Foundation of America, and is consistently identified as one of the most challenging places to live with asthma. To date, however, there is no comprehensive, community-engaged asthma care program for those children at highest risk for poor asthma outcomes. To address this urgent public health concern, our investigative team conducted a year-long, mixed-methods community needs assessment (U34HL130759). Key priority areas that emerged included peer support, advocacy, treating the home as a system, increased school nurse education, and coordination with schools and providers. Our community-engaged team translated the needs assessment findings to a program, RVA Breathes, that coordinates asthma care across four sectors: the family, home, community, and medical care. RVA Breathes includes family-based asthma self-management education (delivered by Community Health Workers [CHWs] with the Institute for Public Health Innovation), home environmental remediation (with Richmond City Health District?s Healthy Homes Initiative), and a school nurse component (with elementary schools in the Richmond City Public School System). These interventions capitalize among existing resources and relationships with stakeholders in Richmond, each of which is committed to RVA Breathes. Three-hundred children with asthma and their caregivers will participate in a randomized clinical trial of RVA Breathes. After completing a baseline assessment, families will be randomized to one of three conditions: 1) asthma education + home remediation + school intervention, 2) asthma education + home remediation and 3) comparator condition (Enhanced Standard of Care, E-SOC). Families will participate in the program for 12 months and complete follow-up assessments (post-treatment and 3-, 6-, and 12-months) to measure changes in healthcare utilization and the impact of the program on child asthma outcomes. Conditions will be compared on the primary outcomes of healthcare utilization, including asthma-specific ED visits and hospital admissions, as well as school absences and medication usage; secondary outcomes include asthma control, symptoms, and quality of life. We will also evaluate the sustainability of RVA Breathes after 12 months (without active intervention), including a review of qualitative data from participants and stakeholders in the program. Findings from this trial will allow for dissemination and implementation of RVA Breathes as a sustainable program in the Richmond area. !"
"9323382","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accelerated statistical image reconstruction methods for X-ray CT X-ray CT provides valuable imaging information for numerous medical applications. Increasing use of CT scans con- tributes significantly to population radiation dose. Decreasing X-ray CT dose will require advances in data acquisition, image reconstruction, post processing, changes in acquisition protocols, and elimination of unneeded scans. Statistical image re- construction (SIR) methods have been used routinely in nuclear medicine imaging for over a decade and have begun to be applied to reduced dose clinical X-ray CT scans. The types of SIR methods that are likely to be most suitable for sub-mSv CT scans use accurate models for the physics and statistics of X-ray CT systems; these methods have required very long computation times that impede their routine clinical use. The primary goal of this project is to develop significantly faster SIR algorithms that will enable routine use of SIR methods for all types of CT scans, particularly sub-mSv scans. The methods developed will be applicable to a wide variety of image acquisition geometries and statistical cost functions, and thus will complement advances in these components by other researchers.  Achieving significant acceleration of SIR requires much more than simply waiting for advances in computer technology. Clock frequencies are no longer increasing, and advances in CT technology (e.g., dual energy, dual sources, and wider cone angles) continue to increase CT data sizes. Traditional SIR algorithms have been designed mathematically with little consideration of modern computing architectures. In this project, imaging scientists and computer scientists will collaborate to develop, implement, and evaluate SIR algorithms that are tailored to modern many-core computing systems that provide parallelism at multiple scales (instruction level, core level, and node level). The goal is to achieve SIR compute times of less than 5 minutes for routine helical chest CT scans at sub-mSv doses, to enable universal use of SIR methods.  The methods developed will benefit all anatomic imaging sites, clinical applications, and patient populations. This project's investigation will focus on a large collection of patient lung nodule C scans that were acquired at the University of Michigan at both 80% and 20% of the usual 40-80 mA (depending on patient size) tube currents for such scans. The 80% dose scans are typically in the 1-1.5 mSv range whereas the 20% dose scans are in the 0.25-0.4 mSv range. The archived sinograms in this collection provide a unique and valuable resource for investigating sub-mSv chest CT and for comparing to regular dose chest CT scans. Both numerical observer studies and radiologist observer studies will evaluate detection performance and morphological characterization of lung nodules with advanced SIR methods at sub-mSv doses. These lung studies are particularly timely in light of the recent USPSTF draft recommendation [1, 2] that is likely to lead to substantial increased use of annual CT exams for patients at risk of lung cancer."
"9314174","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Most adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) struggle with mental health problems, most commonly anxiety and depression. Despite their high prevalence and associated impairment, co-occurring psychiatric disorders often are untreated in adults with ASD. Emerging evidence suggests that specially modified cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) effectively reduces anxiety and depression in adults with ASD; however, few clinicians are trained to deliver this type of care. Little is known regarding how to best deploy such evidence-based mental health interventions for adults with ASD in community mental health (CMH) settings. The aims of the proposed study are to: 1) Identify CMH clinicians' training needs, from both therapist and consumer perspectives, to provide quality care to adults with ASD and co-occurring anxiety disorders; 2) Adapt an anxiety treatment manual for adults with ASD and a therapist training protocol to implement this intervention in CMH centers; and 3) Examine the feasibility and acceptability of the adapted treatment and associated therapist training protocol. This study will rely on an established academic-community partnership between the University of Pennsylvania's Center for Mental Health Policy and Services Research and two Philadelphia CMH centers serving adults. Qualitative and quantitative data from focus groups, semi-structured individual interviews, and online surveys, combined with expert opinion, will be integrated to inform the design of the anxiety intervention manual for adults with ASD and a CMH clinician training protocol. Findings from this study will be used to increase the currently limited treatment options available for adults with ASD and co-occurring anxiety disorders. The proposed research and training activities facilitate the applicant's long-term goal of pursuing an academic research career dedicated to improving mental health services and quality of life for adults with ASD through dissemination and implementation science. Specific training goals are to: 1) Gain expertise in academic-community partnership; 2) Develop skills related to designing and implementing new practices in the public mental health sector; 3) Acquire a strong foundation in mixed methods; and 4) Integrate research, professional development, and scholarship to prepare for success as an independent researcher."

"9305207","ABSTRACT: West Virginians have one of the highest prevalence of comorbid diabetes and hypertension in the United States, which poses an enormous disease and economic burden in this medically underserved state. Self- management of these conditions are an essential component of comprehensive disease management. The majority of self-management programs in West Virginia are clinic or hospital-based, disease specific, short- term, and provide limited participant interactions. The proposed study aims to fill this need by implementing a new and creative community-based, culturally appropriate, and cost-effective Diabetes and Hypertension Self-Management program (DHSMP) among adults with comorbid diabetes and hypertension. The DHSMP is adapted from the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) and AADE-7 self-care behaviors, and tailored for rural and socio-economically disadvantaged populations, using the community based participatory approach. The DHSMP will be administered by trained Health Coaches and will involve communication between them and the participants to provide continuous feedback and reinforcement of self-management strategies and health education messages. We will use a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the 12-week DHSMP to an enhanced usual care (EUC) control group and conduct rigorous cost-effectiveness analyses. The DHSMP builds on the PI?s successful prior community-based lifestyle intervention studies in rural Appalachia and rural India. Seventy adults with comorbid T2DM and HTN will be recruited and randomized to 12-week DHSMP intervention (n=35) or an EUC control group (n=35) in two geographically separated Appalachian communities in WV. EUC participants will be waitlisted to receive DHSMP after 3 months. Specific aims will test the hypotheses that the participants randomized to receive the 12-week DHSMP will have significantly greater improvements in self-efficacy, and reductions in HbA1c and blood pressure as well as reduction in weight, and improvements in diet, physical activity, health?related quality of life and social support at 3 and 6 months as compared to the EUC control group. We anticipate that the DHSMP will be cost- effective. Data on demographic, life-style factors, costs, anthropometric measures and clinical indicators will be collected during baseline and post intervention periods (3 and 6 months). The results will inform the development and translation of large-scale community interventions to promote self-management of co-morbid chronic conditions in this medically underserved and rural Appalachian population."

This is likely to explain observations that B cell depletion with anti-CD20 can rapidly improve autoimmune diseases, such as RA and MS, without depleting auto-Ab. Yet in other patients, autoimmunity is worsened. Moreover, peri-transplant depletion of B cells can markedly increase acute rejection in renal allograft recipients and chronic vasculopathy in heart transplantation. These contradictory results are likely due to the presence of both Bregs and Beff, and not knowing which predominates at a given time, in a given clinical setting, or in a given patient. A similar dichotomy is present in mice, where B cell depletion/deficiency can either inhibit or promote autoimmunity and allograft rejection. We contend that targeting B cells in autoimmune and transplant patients would have far better outcomes if Beff were selectively targeted and Bregs were left intact. Unfortunately, little is known about Bregs, and even less is known about Beff cells. In mice, B cells expressing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IFN? play a key role promoting autoimmune responses in EAE and proteoglycan- induced arthritis. Moreover, in response to various infections, B cells exhibit rapid and transient innate-like protective responses through expression of TNF?, IFN?, IL-2, and IL-17. However, it is unknown whether, or how, any of these responses relate to one another, because no phenotype for such Beff has been established and individual cytokines were examined in isolation. Thus, major aspects of Beff biology, including what regulates their differentiation and cytokine expression, are completely unknown. We have now discovered that TIM-4 identifies Beff that express inflammatory cytokines including IFN? and IL-17, and accelerate allograft rejection. Eliminating expression of these cytokines by B cells, reverses this proinflammatory role, but can also markedly inhibit the alloimmune response and promote tolerance. Moreover, some cytokines affect the expression of others. Notably, IL-17 is not only a potent effector cytokine, but is essential for Beff to develop an inflammatory rather than regulatory program. Finally, TIM-4 ligation inhibits expression of proinflammatory cytokines. Understanding the role of TIM-4+ Beff in priming the immune response and identifying how this response can be regulated to promote tolerance, are key and unique aspects of this proposal. These results are likely to provide a unifying framework for understanding Beff cells, and will have major impact on the field.  In Aim 1 we will determine whether TIM-4+ Beff express a ?proinflammatory module? comprised of additional effector molecules and transcriptional regulatory elements, and determine key aspects of its regulation. In Aim 2 we will define key mechanisms by which TIM-4+ Beff promote allograft rejection. In Aim 3 we will determine how TIM-4 signaling regulates expression of the Beff pro-inflammatory module. This work will greatly enhance our understanding of Beff biology and provide therapeutic insights highly relevant to immune tolerance."
"9280425","SUMMARY CORE C: CORRELATIVE SCIENCES Immuno-gene therapies have demonstrated an unparalleled anti-cancer efficacy in very poor prognosis patients. Limitations in the in vivo efficacy of the patient?s own T cells in CLL, antigen escape-related relapse in ALL, a CAR-engineered T cell pool outpaced by tumor cells in myeloma, and lack of appropriate, tumor- selective CAR in AML has given rise to the current proposal wherein innovative approaches are expected to solve the aforementioned challenges in cellular immunotherapy. Our trials will be the first to use CRISPR/Cas9-enhanced immune-gene therapy to treat some of the most challenging cases in each clinical indication; the first to use CART cells targeting two different antigens; the first to target AML with normal donor CART cells targeting CD33 while repopulating the host with CD33-edited hematopoietic stem cells. Critical to the success of cell therapies is a central correlative sciences laboratory to study the in vivo kinetics and homing of the infusion product(s) and the response of the tumor and the bioactivity of the infused cells; Core C provides this GCLP-based yet nimble infrastructure to support the clinical trials proposed herein, where SOP-specified molecular, cellular, and biochemical assays will be performed, reviewed by qualified personnel, and entered into a database for aggregate analysis to evaluate the efficacy of our proposed trials and compare with previously run CART cell trials at UPenn."
"9381695","ABSTRACT Discover and functionally characterize full-penetrance causes of nephrosis/FSGS. Chronic kidney diseases (CKD) take one of the highest tolls on human health, and their prevalence continuously rises. Steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) is the 2nd most frequent cause of CKD before 25 yrs. By focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) it inevitably leads to CKD with a 33% recurrence risk in a renal transplant. The pathogenesis of SRNS is unknown and no curative treatment is available. For SRNS, the primary causes (etiology) and disease mechanisms (pathogenesis) have been a conundrum for decades. However, identification of full-penetrance single-gene causes of NS (e.g. podocin) has implicated the renal glomerular podocyte at the center of the pathogenesis. Within the 2 previous R01 funding periods we: 1) Identified by whole exome sequencing 34 of the 50 currently known single-gene causes of NS and functionally characterized the related disease mechanisms; 2) Discovered that the encoded proteins cluster in protein complexes thereby defining novel disease pathways for SRNS (e.g., RhoA/Rac1/Cdc42 signaling); 3) Delineated genotype-phenotype correlations with actionable implications for personalized disease management; 4) Modeled the related disease mechanisms in the `podocyte migration assay', zebrafish & mouse models; 5) Revealed `personalized treatment' options for specific patients (e.g. CoQ10 in COQ6 or ADCK4 mutations); 6) Demonstrated in a world-wide cohort that ~30% of SRNS (<25 yrs) is caused by single-gene mutations, thereby permitting genetic mechanistic studies and personalized medicine for patients with SRNS ; 7) Discovered the first genetic causes of steroid-dependent NS (6 genes), converging on RhoA regulation. These genetic discoveries made the study of SRNS accessible to genetic approaches of `precision medicine', enabling genetic diagnostics, the study of `personalized' disease mechanisms, and treatment approaches. We, therefore will pursue the following Specific Aims: SA1. Discover the missing single-gene causes of SRNS by WES in ~1,000 SRNS families. SA2. Functionally characterize newly identified single-gene causes of SRNS/SSNS to delineate the  pathogenesis and study `personalized' genotype-phenotype and genotype-treatment correlations. SA3. Perform small molecule screens in CRISPR k.o. models of novel SRNS genes identified, using  established `podocyte migration assay' and zebrafish models, to discover the first drugs for SRNS. SA4. Study the 6 novel single-gene causes that we discovered in steroid-dependent NS to converge  on RhoA regulation delineate mechanisms of steroid and other direct drug effects on podocytes."
"9326818","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is a common skin inflammatory condition with rapidly rising prevalence among industrial nations in recent decades. Acute ACD is characterized by an intense skin rash and itching that develops at the site of exposure to contact allergens like nickel in about 20% of general population. Acute ACD is known to have tumor-suppressing effects in the skin, which has led to its use for the treatment of warts and skin cancers. However, the effects of chronic ACD on skin cancer have not been fully investigated. Implantable medical devices such as orthopedic, dental, and cardiac implants are a source of chronic ACD. These devices are being increasingly used in medical practice, which highlights the importance of research on chronic ACD to better treat this condition and prevent its associated adverse events. In a recent report, we found that chronic ACD to an orthopedic metal implant led to an invasive skin cancer in a patient. To demonstrate a causal relationship, we used the standard mouse model of contact hypersensitivity and showed that chronic application of a contact allergen to carcinogen-treated skin led to the development of aggressive skin cancers in the animals. The chronic ACD-associated inflammation was required for the skin cancer development. Importantly, we found a similar tumor-promoting inflammatory environment surrounding the skin cancer in our patient. These findings highlight a fundamental question: how does an anti-tumor immune response turn into a pro-tumor immune environment in its chronic phase? In order to address this question and determine the mechanism of tumor promotion by chronic ACD, I hypothesized that (a) skin-derived factors mediate the transition from anti-tumor skin inflammation in acute ACD to pro-tumor skin inflammation in chronic ACD, and (b) the tumor-promoting immune environment in chronic ACD is mediated by the interactions between several groups of immune cell types. To test these hypotheses, I propose to (1) determine the mechanism that mediates the transition from tumor-suppressing immune response in acute ACD to tumor- promoting immune environment in chronic ACD, and (2) Determine the mechanism of tumor promotion in chronic ACD. The outcome of this research will provide a mechanistic insight into the role of ACD in skin cancer development. Considering the role of chronic inflammation in promoting cancer development in several organs, the understanding of how chronic ACD promotes skin cancer will be highly applicable in blocking the tumor-promoting effects of chronic inflammation in the skin and other organs."
"9307264","ABSTRACT There are an estimated 765,000 people with a diagnosis of bladder cancer living in the United States and risk of disease recurrence and progression can be high. Frequent, invasive transurethral screening procedures to monitor for recurrence and progression burden both patients and the health care system. A better understanding of the tumor-associated immune responses in bladder cancer patients could provide for more informed clinical decisions on the necessary frequency of invasive follow up procedures and reduce patient morbidity. We propose to leverage an existing population-based study of bladder cancer that includes a range of patient age groups, has several years of follow up, includes patient treatment and outcome data, as well as matched tumor samples. Our collaborative group has developed and extensively validated epigenetic biomarkers of leukocyte subtypes allowing the use of archival DNA to study immune profiles. Here we will use our proven framework to expand our repertoire of leukocyte epigenetic biomarkers to include myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC), and test and validate the relation of MDSC and other leukocyte subtypes (including the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio: NLR), and cell type activation states with bladder cancer outcomes; recurrence, progression, and survival. We will use time-to-event analysis and aim to understand the independent contributions of immune profiles, age at diagnosis, tumor stage and grade, smoking history, and treatment (including BCG immunotherapy), with bladder cancer outcomes. In addition, we propose to measure somatic alteration profiles of bladder tumors from matched subjects and assess the relation of blood immune signatures with tumor methylation and survival to understand the crosstalk between tumor profiles and patient immune responses. Finally, in an exploratory aim we will prospectively investigate both pre-treatment and post- treatment immune signatures in bladder cancer patients. At this opportune time of emerging immunomodulatory therapeutics our existing population-based study resource provides a cost-efficient setting to advance towards improved risk projection in newly diagnosed patients by ushering in a novel and flexible immune monitoring toolkit that can inform clinical decision-making using data on tumor-associated immune responses."

"9330233","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The overall goal of this application is to identify and qualify exosomal non-coding RNA based biomarkers in the circulation to detect early stage disease in patients at risk, to predict recurrence after surgery and to monitor response to therapy in patients with hepatocellular cancer (HCC). The incidence of this cancer is increasing and survival remains poor. Early detection of HCC is essential to survival, yet current biomarkers such as AFP lack the sensitivity to sufficiently detect early stage cancer amenable to surgical cure. Our preliminary studies have identified several microRNA and long-non-coding RNA that are selectively enriched within exosomes released from HCC cells. Moreover, we have cloned a novel long non-coding RNA gene, TUC339 that is very highly enriched in exosomes released from HCC cells, and that can be detected in serum from patients with HCC. We hypothesize that tumor specific non-coding RNA that are selectively released within exosomes into the circulation can be detected to provide highly specific biomarkers for HCC. This project will test this hypothesis using a rigorous two phase biomarker development process to evaluate the utility of exosomal TUC339 and to identify other extracellular non-coding RNA (exRNA) as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of HCC. The goal of the first phase will be to identify lead candidates and to develop digital PCR based assays for their detection whereas the goals of the second phase will be to validate the clinical utility of promising exRNA candidates by prospectively validating their capability for diagnosis and as biomarkers of recurrence or treatment response. The study design includes (a) evaluation of identified exRNA candidates and further discovery studies for known or novel long non-coding RNA, (b) explicit biospecimen collection and processing, (c) a multi-stage integrated approach with a prospective case control study, comparison with independently obtained case-control reference samples, and an independent multi-center validation study either as part of a planned on-going study (HEDS) or through a new consortium-based study. Additionally, we will prospectively evaluate exRNA as predictors of recurrence or treatment response. Through these efforts, we expect to develop novel analytical assays for circulating exRNA and to identify a clinically relevant biomarker that will be useful as a diagnostic, prognostic or treatment response marker for patients with HCC."
"9333271","Project 1 Abstract  Cutaneous melanoma accounts for the majority (~75%) of skin cancer deaths. Despite the  recent improvements in prevention and early detection, approximately 20% of patients with  melanoma still die from the diseases. Patients with metastases have a poor prognosis and a  very short life expectancy. About 50% of human melanoma harbor BRafV600 mutations.  Vemurafenib (Vem), a specific inhibitor of the mutated BRaf, is very effective for treating  metastatic melanoma. Unfortunately, drug resistance emerges 3-18 months post treatment due  to alternative mechanisms that reactivate the MEK/ERK pathway. Vem resistant melanoma,  however, exhibits elevated expression of melanoma associated antigens, gp100, MART-1 and  Tyrosinase. Thus, the drug resistant disease provides opportunity for two independent, yet  complementary, therapeutic approaches, i.e. synthetic lethality and cancer vaccine. To block the  alternative Raf kinase, we have discovered that the suppressor gene Sprouty4, when delivered  by LPH (lipid-polycation-hyaluronic acid) nanoparticles (NPs) developed in this group, could  effectively down-regulate MEK/ERK pathway, leading to reduced growth rate in Vem resistant  melanoma. We will follow up this novel gene therapy strategy by using a newly discovered  lipopolyplex containing polymetformin (aim 1) to demonstrate the mechanism of the synthetic  lethality (aim 2). Polymetformin is much less toxic than the equivalent polyethyleneimine and  inhibits mTOR to further suppress the survival mechanism of the tumor cells. Since our Vem  resistant tumor is also PTEN deficient, we will also develop a siRNA therapy to silence Akt. At  the same time, we will use a BRaf mutant melanoma in a syngeneic mouse model to study  tumor growth inhibition using a new mRNA vaccine formulation (aim 3). mRNAs of several  melanoma associated antigens, including those up-regulated in Vem resistant tumor, will be  formulated in LCP (lipid-calcium-phosphate) NPs and delivered to the dendritic cells in the  lymph nodes. Preliminary data indicate that this approach was very effective in inducing an  antigen-specific CTL response in the host and significantly inhibited the growth of the primary as  well as the metastatic melanoma in the lymph nodes. We will finally combine the gene/drug  therapy with the vaccine therapy to overcome Vem resistance in melanoma."
"9387859","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Spatiotemporal regulation of cellular dynamics is fundamental to animal development. A thorough understanding of developmental mechanisms requires approaches that permit in vivo perturbation of endogenous proteins in a spatially and temporally controlled manner. Such approaches are particularly important for understanding neuronal morphogenesis and the etiology of neurological disorders, as neurons usually occupy broad spatial domains and exhibit diverse growth dynamics at different dendritic and axonal branches. However, existing techniques for manipulating endogenous gene function in animal models, such as gene knockout, RNAi, and protein degradation, affect the whole cell and require time to take effect, and therefore lack the spatial and temporal resolution needed for dissecting dynamic growth behaviors of neurons at the subcellular level. We propose to develop an optogenetic system in Drosophila to enable rapid inhibition of endogenous proteins in precisely defined regions of cells. This will be achieved by light-inducible trapping of GFP-tagged endogenous proteins in large protein clusters. Such a strategy should be effective for inhibiting proteins whose functions require specific subcellular locations. Our system will be tested in sensory neurons and epidermal epithelial cells of Drosophila larvae, two cell types that are relevant to a broad range of human diseases. Several endogenously tagged proteins of diverse size, subcellular localization, and function will be first tested in a protein trapping assay. To validate the effectiveness of light-induced protein inhibition, the roles of Rab5 and Fry in dendrite morphogenesis of Drosophila sensory neurons will be investigated using GFP- tagged endogenous proteins. Rab5 and Fry are important for dendritic patterning. However, it is unknown whether they control dendritic growth by locally regulating dendritic dynamics or by globally modulating gene expression. By locally inhibiting Rab5 and Fry in individual dendritic branches, it will be determined whether they regulate local dendritic dynamics. The primary goal of this project is to establish the first Drosophila light- inducible loss-of-function system for investigating the local and moment-to-moment function of endogenous proteins in vivo. The increasing number of endogenous proteins tagged by GFP in Drosophila and the convenience of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing make our approach applicable to the study of a wide variety of proteins, biological processes, and human diseases. Our approach should also be applicable in other model organisms."
"9412006","Abstract West Virginia (WV) has the highest drug overdose fatality and hepatitis B rates in the U.S.A., especially in the rural southern coalfield counties. While no known HIV outbreaks have yet occurred in these areas, they are a ?ticking time bomb?, especially as the current ability to detect and mitigate an outbreak is poor. WV has been devastated economically by the collapse of the coal industry. Economic devastation, coupled with the ready availability of prescription opioids, led to an explosive epidemic that has transitioned from oral pills to heroin injection. The threat of an HIV outbreak here is among the highest in the U.S.A. per CDC?s analysis of the 2014- 2015 Scott County, Indiana HIV outbreak and the high rates of poverty, overdose deaths, and hepatitis B and C. Although HIV has not yet been a significant problem, microepidemics are likely among insular injection drug use (IDU) networks in remote rural areas that remain unidentified due to a weak HIV testing system. Geographic isolation and scarce healthcare resources in WV are also significant challenges to early identification of HIV and prevention of transmission. The long-term objective of this multidisciplinary study team and our established partners statewide is to end the opioid epidemic in WV and its associated consequences of infectious diseases. The overall hypothesis of this study is that, by developing a novel, integrated prevention, harm reduction, and treatment strategy to rapidly identify and mitigate HIV microepidemics, we can limit further spread and reduce hazardous IDU in southern WV. Aim 1. Create an evidence-based road map, working with local communities and public health agencies, to coordinate and improve screening, prevention and treatment for HIV and other IDU-associated diseases. A mixed-methods approach will identify strengths and weaknesses of current testing and public health infrastructure. Aim 2. Develop and test a novel strategy to rapidly identify the emergence of HIV in isolated rural communities. A multicomponent rapid notification ?Opioid Data Repository? will be developed to identify HIV and ?sentinel opioid-related conditions? that can indicate those at risk, IDU prevalence, and the emergence of new HIV (and HCV) cases. Aim 3. Overcome service gaps by deploying an integrated service delivery model based on earlier findings, including evidence-based maps of services and IDU prevalence. Prevention efforts will include enhanced delivery of evidence-based services, implementing novel screening strategies, and integrating existing and enhanced data sources. Improved treatment will result from providing mobile and telehealth services to bridge treatment gaps in isolated areas, and from integrating screening, medical care and addiction treatment. Aim 4. Evaluate the effectiveness (including cost effectiveness), replicability and sustainability of the integrated service delivery model. Making program adjustments based on evaluation and community input is critically important if we are to prevent the devastating effects of an HIV epidemic in these hard-hit communities."
"9348049","Project Summary Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) is a major public health problem associated with the majority of the 300,000 cases of sudden cardiac death in the United States each year. The best current therapy for VT involves drugs to reduce VT episodes plus implantation of a cardiac defibrilator (ICD) that prolongs life by terminating episodes of VT. Permanent cessation of VT can be achieved by ablation of the origin site(s) and exit pathway(s) of the arrhythmia. Despite the advantages of this technique, its adoption has been limited because it is currently appropriate only for the few patients with hemodynamically stable VT. This project will create a disruptive, less expensive, more effective, and safer system for minimally invasive identification and ablation of critical VT sites. It will combine the HeartLander (HL) epicardial walker with a non-invasive mapping technology and a flexible, needle-based, radio frequency ablation technique. In prior work we have demonstrated that these technologies can be integrated into a unified system and have also eliminated major technical risks of the technologies. In this Fast Track SBIR application, we propose to complete the integration of the technologies and then verify the efficacy of the system in a Yorkshire swine pig model of VT. Upon successful completion, we will be ready to advance to the clinic a simpler, safer, more reliable and less expensive approach to effectively treating the 500,000 annual cases of ventricular tachycardia. We will also have built the hardware and computation infrastructure to support additional mapping methodologies that will enable the treatment of complex multi-focal arrhythmias."

Its overall goal is to efficiently and effectively move basic and applied research findings into human clinical studies and ultimately into clinical practice through the implementation and dissemination of therapeutic drugs, biologics, devices and software. To optimally serve IDDRC investigators, the CTC will partner with and leverage the core resources of the two Washington DC-based CTSA-funded programs that involve partnerships between 1) Children?s National Health System (CNHS) and The George Washington University (GWU) (the Clinical and Translational Science Institute at Children?s National; CTSI-CN) and 2) Georgetown University and Howard University (the Georgetown-Howard Universities Center for Clinical and Translational Science; GHUCCTS). It will also work on coordinating access to core services within the Mid-Atlantic IDDRC consortium (MAC) that includes the Children?s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), the Kennedy Krieger Institute (KKI) and CNHS. These partnerships will increase cost-efficiency in resource access, minimize wasteful duplication, and maximize the impact of the CTC for our investigators. Three Aims are proposed to fulfill the mission of the CTC: 1) Integrate the local clinical and translational research functions for investigator-initiated IDD studies. The CTC will establish a flexible and streamlined administrative structure that minimizes barriers and provides specific infrastructure supports for DC-IDDRC investigators and their teams to assure the conduct of efficient, effective and high quality CTR; 2) Integrate regional IDDR resources through the Mid-Atlantic IDDRC consortium (MAC). The CTC will broaden DC-IDDRC investigator knowledge about and access to essential services and expertise available at other institutions in the MAC to provide investigators with access to the full range of CTR methodologies and expertise available; and 3) Integrate resources from the NIH intramural program/clinical research center and industry partners to facilitate collaborative partnerships that include the availability of high throughput screening of cells, tissues, and experimental models for preclinical biomarker and therapeutic efficacy studies. The CTC will also assist DC- IDDRC investigators with issues related to technology transfer, commercialization, and intellectual property protection. Therefore, the CTC will serve as an integrator for the DC-IDDRC, interacting with investigators from project conception to completion and dissemination of results, as well as providing an effective interface for DC-IDDRC investigators with the DC-based CTSA-funded programs, our MAC collaborators, and NIH and industry partners. These functions will promote efficient, impactful and compliant CTR that facilitates the development, implementation, and dissemination of new diagnostic and therapeutic advances for the care of individuals with IDD."
"9328174","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lysosomal dysfunction has been implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases, including adult onset Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Several lines of evidence point to lysosomal dysfunction as a critical disease mechanism in frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin positive inclusions (FTLD-U)-the most prevalent early onset dementia after Alzheimer's disease. The haplo- insufficiency of the Progranulin (PGRN) gene has been identified as a major cause of FTLD-U, and patients with homozygous PGRN mutations develop neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL), a lysosomal storage disorder. This suggests that PGRN plays a central role in regulating lysosomal function. Other genes mutated in FTLD-U-VCP/p97 and CHMP2B-also regulate endolysosomal trafficking. Further, TMEM106B, a newly identified genetic risk factor for FTLD-U with PGRN mutations, is a lysosomal membrane protein, and increased TMEM106B levels result in lysosomal dysfunction and increased risk for FTLD-U. Our research will examine the physiological functions of TMEM106B in lysosomes and their role in neurodegeneration. In Aim1, we will use molecular and cell biological approaches to determine how TMEM106B regulates lysosomal activities and lysosomal dynamics. Potential TMEM106B binding partners will also be tested for their function in lysosomes. In Aim2, we will probe cellular mechanisms that regulate TMEM106B levels and function. In particular, our research will examine the role of regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) and ubiquitination. In Aim3, we will compare the in vitro and in vivo phenotypes of elevated TMEM106B levels in wild type and PGRN deficient conditions using virus mediated gene delivery to mimic FTLD-U cases. We will also explore the effect of TMEM106B on PGRN metabolism. These proposed studies will shed light on TMEM106B function in lysosomes and cellular pathways that regulate TMEM106B. We hope this research will illustrate the interaction between TMEM106B and PGRN in FTLD-U and provide the foundation for FTLD-U therapeutics. Importantly, this work will also generate broader insights into the regulation of lysosomal function that may be applied in a variety of other neurodegenerative diseases."
"9334568","Project Summary/Abstract Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are ubiquitous and persistent organic pollutants that adversely affect human health. Although industrial production of PCBs has been discontinued, they remain a pressing environmental problem due to their slow biodegradation and high lipophilicity. These properties enable PCBs to bio-accumulate in food chains leading to high tissue levels in organism important for human consumption. Once in the body, PCBs accumulates in various organs leading to inflammation and activation of the transcription factor NF-?B. NF-?B is a driver of inflammation and has been linked to a multitude of diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, cancer and diabetes. Despite dietary exposure being the main route of exposure to PCBs, the human gastrointestinal tract has been widely ignored when studying the pro-inflammatory effects of PCBs. This is a significant oversight given that the intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) are simultaneously exposed to the inflammatory effects the gut microbiota, which are also affected by the PCBs. The functional consequences of PCBs effects on the microbiome have also yet to be studied. This is vital information given the widespread influence of the microbiome. The proposed studies will interrogate interaction between PCBs, IECs, and the microbiota with particular focus on the mechanism by which PCB153 (the most prevalent PCB in the environment) exerts its effects. Exposure to PCB153 has been shown to lead to an increased intestinal permeability along with signs of gross intestinal inflammation and changes in the microbiome. I hypothesize that PCB153 causes intestinal inflammation and increases gut permeability via genotoxic activation of NF-?B and the creation of a pro-inflammatory gut microbiome. To interrogate this, specific aim 1 will look at the effects of PCB153 specifically on the IECs, both in vitro and in vivo. Intestinal cell lines along with gnotobiotic mice, mice entirely lacking a microbiome, will be used to determine the extent and mechanism of NF-?B activation by PCB153 in the absence of the microbiome. Specificity to the proposed mechanism will be established using a chemical inhibitor of NF-?B. Specific aim 2 will determine the functional consequences of PCB153's effect on the microbiome. PCB-exposed microbiomes will be transplanted into gnotobiotic mice and then challenged with a pro-inflammatory agent. Their levels of inflammation will be compared with those of mice transplanted with PCB-naïve microbiomes shedding light on the pro-inflammatory effects of the PCB-exposed microbiome on the host. These studies will establish the importance of NF-?B in the inflammatory and permeability changes caused my PCB153 in the gut. Importantly, they will be able to draw clear conclusions about the distinct roles of the microbiota and IECs. This knowledge, will depict new routes of investigation and potential therapies for humans and other organisms exposed to organic pollutants."

"9368493","PROJECT SUMMARY  Acute kidney injury (AKI) remains a critical health problem worldwide. AKI patients requiring renal replacement therapy (dialysis) still have a 50-60% mortality rate. Patients survived dialysis-requiring AKI have a 28-fold increased risk of developing progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD), leading to end stage renal disease (ESRD). It is recognized that functioning nephrons respond to nephron deficits by increases in size and mass but not in number. Such a growth response is called compensatory nephron hypertrophy (CNH), which can occur in many situations in humans (e.g. surgical renal ablation due to renal trauma, tumor, congenital unilateral renal agenesis, or donating a kidney). Although kidney donors are highly selected from healthy individuals, recent studies have renewed our knowledge by increasingly documenting that kidney donors do have an increased risk of developing CKD and ESRD. Our goal is to define a previously undefined pathogenic role of CNH in determining the susceptibility and severity of AKI and in mediating accelerated development of interstitial fibrosis, a critical area in fighting AKI and CKD. We will also investigate the molecular mechanisms by which hypertrophied nephrons are sensitized to acute and chronic injury, with the long-term goal to identify molecular targets to reduce the incidence of AKI and development and/or progression of CKD to ESRD. Our central hypothesis is that CNH sensitizes nephrons to injury and initiates a cycle of nephron loss ? nephron hypertrophy, consequently depleting functional nephrons at an accelerated rate, ultimately leading to ESRD. Our expected outcomes include: 1) a revised understanding of the traditionally so-called ?compensatory renal hypertrophy? by demonstrating that hypertrophied nephron cells are sensitized to injury; 2) identification of the vicious cycle of nephron loss ? nephron hypertrophy as a previously under-appreciated fundamental mechanism that drives progressive nephron damage; and 3) identification of additional potential new targets for desensitizing hypertrophied nephrons from ischemic AKI. The impact of our study will include: 1) establishment of the vicious cycle of nephron loss ? nephron hypertrophy as an important mechanism underlying the progressive nature of many kidney diseases and documenting a deleterious aspect of CNH in sensitizing nephrons to injury; and 2) providing necessary preclinical knowledge about the molecular mechanisms by which CNH occurs and drives progressive nephron damage. This project may lead to development of novel and improved treatment by targeting specific signaling molecules to slow or even stop the vicious cycle of nephron loss ? nephron hypertrophy to prevent kidney disease progression. Aim 1 will define the role of compensatory nephron hypertrophy in determining susceptibility and severity of AKI. Aim 2 will determine the mechanisms by which compensatory nephron hypertrophy sensitizes nephrons to AKI. Aim 3 will determine the mechanisms by which CNH accelerates development of renal fibrosis."
"9322361","Abstract Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness among older adults in the developed world. While the pathological mechanism(s) have not been definitively elucidated, we hypothesize that defects in the mitochondria are a key event in AMD progression. The goal of the current proposal is to utilize our unique resource of human donor tissue, phenotyped for the presence and severity of AMD, and genotyped for AMD risk alleles, to investigate how and why the mitochondria are damaged with AMD. Based on our preliminary results, this study will focus on donors harboring the AMD risk SNP (rs1061170; amino acid change Y402H) for complement factor H (CFH) since this group demonstrated significantly more mtDNA damage. Pre-selecting this subpopulation should increase our ability to detect significant changes in the RPE proteome, thus providing a more refined elucidation of AMD disease mechanism and potential new targets for therapeutic intervention aimed at preventing AMD development and/or slowing disease progression. The ultimate goal is to minimize vision loss in AMD patients. Aim 1 will utilize state-of-the-art technology (8-plex iTRAQ protein labeling, Orbitrap Velos Mass Spectrometer, Protein Pilot peptide analysis) to evaluate the mitochondrial and non-mito proteome in donors harboring either WT (TT) or homozygous risk (CC) alleles for CFH. Aim 2 will determine the sites of failure in processes associated with maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis by examining the content of proteins involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, fission/fusion, and autophagic removal of damaged mitochondria in human donor RPE. Immunohistochemistry and TEM of retinal sections from genotyped donors will determine if localization of key mt proteins or mt characteristics are altered in a genotype or disease-dependent manner. The proposed studies will provide novel information that is pertinent for developing ?personalized medicine? for AMD patients using state-of-the-art analytical methods and well-characterized donor tissue to reveal the molecular details responsible for AMD-associated mitochondrial dysfunction."
"9324974","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is for the Continuation of the Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network (NASH CRN) - Data Coordinating Center. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects one out of every three adults and five children in North America and is a growing public health issue in the United States. NAFLD, and especially nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), may lead to end-stage liver disease and primary liver cancer, as well as liver-, cardiovascular-, and cancer-related mortality, resulting in major increases in health burdens and costs. The NASH CRN is ideally and uniquely positioned to impact the growing public health significance of NASH that can only be addressed via a large research consortium. The primary objective of the NASH CRN is to perform clinical research on NASH and NAFLD in adults and children. A closely linked and high priority secondary objective is to conduct translational research in NASH and NAFLD focusing on the pathogenesis that will provide the basis for understanding the natural history and developing means of better diagnosis, treatment, and clinical management. In the next phase of the NASH CRN, the adult and pediatric therapeutic trials initiated during the previous funding cycle will be completed, and new therapeutic trials, including phase 2a proof of mechanism and phase 2b clinical trials will be initiated, to develop evidence-based treatment options that are safe, effective, simple, and inexpensive. The longitudinal cohort of adults and children with NAFLD will be extended, which will prospectively define the natural history of the disease, the cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors, and will aid in biomarker discovery and validation, and development and validation of non-invasive techniques to evaluate and identify those with NASH/NAFLD, who will respond, and how quickly the disease is progressing. The Data Coordinating Center will provide the NASH CRN with leadership, expertise (in biostatistical analysis, study design, data management, multicenter coordination, quality control methods) and project support, communication and organization and is eager to continue its collaboration with the clinical centers, NIDDK program staff, and private sector partners to complete these very important research objectives. The NASH CRN is poised to continue its major impact on the field and directly advance the mission of the National Institutes of Health to improve the health of the public."
"9244936","PROJECT SUMMARY Hepatic dysfunction or failure caused by ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is a major problem following liver transplantation, resection, and the hemorrhagic shock. Despite recent progress in improving surgical procedure and pharmacological therapy, the host immune response leading to liver damage remains the greatest challenge during hepatic IR. Embryonic stem (ES) cell derivatives offer a potentially important renewable source of any type of tissue for cell replacement therapies. Dendritic cells (DC) are specialized immune cells that play vital roles in initiating robust immunity against pathogens as well as maintaining immune homeostasis. The regulation of liver inflammatory response using genetically modified ES cell-derived DC (ES- DC) could potentially ameliorate liver damage. Recently, it has been shown that ?-catenin is required for the regulation of immune response induced by DC, critical for the innate and adaptive immunity in inflammatory disease. Moreover, Notch signaling is essential for the DC differentiation and function. The overall goal of this proposal is to elucidate the roles and potential mechanisms of ?-catenin in regulating immune response in ES- DC, and the acquisition of immune regulation in hepatic IRI by an inducible ?-catenin-modified ES cell system. We hypothesize that induction of ?-catenin activity in ES-DC regulates IR-triggered inflammatory response in liver via a Notch-mediated Jagged1-Hes1 signaling network. To test this hypothesis, the following specific aims are proposed: 1) Investigate the role of ?-catenin in regulating immune response in ES- DC. 2) Investigate the acquisition of immune regulation by ?-catenin-modified ES-DC in vivo. These studies will reveal the role of ?-catenin in controlling ES-DC function and increase our understanding of ?-catenin- mediated immunoregulatory networks in innate and adaptive immune system during IR-triggered liver inflammation. Using genetically modified ES-DC system provides a novel approach and establishes a potential clinical feasibility for the amelioration of ischemic tissue injury in organ transplantation, resection, and hemorrhagic shock, as well as other sterile inflammatory disease states."

"9310535","Heart Failure (HF) is the most frequent cause of hospitalization among patients aged 65 or greater and leads to an enormous personal, societal and economic burden for the US population. Loop diuretics such as torsemide and furosemide are a cornerstone of HF therapy utilized to improve congestive symptoms. Prior data suggest that torsemide compared to furosemide advantageously alters pathophysiological mechanisms associated with progression, has a favorable pharmacodynamic profile and may decrease HF morbidity and mortality. Yet, furosemide is overwhelmingly utilized in daily practice which highlights clinical equipoise and an unmet need for an adequately powered study to definitively determine whether torsemide compared to furosemide improves outcomes to guide clinical practice. The ToRsemide compArisoN with furoSemide FOR Management of HF (TRANSFORM-HF) trial is a robustly-powered, prospective, randomized, comparative-effectiveness study which will change guidelines and have immediate clinical implications for the management of millions of patients with HF. The primary hypothesis of the TRANSFORM-HF trial is that torsemide will reduce all-cause mortality by a relative 15% compared with furosemide over a period of 12 months. Important secondary hypotheses include that torsemide compared to furosemide will 1) reduce 1-year all-cause mortality and first HF re-hospitalization; 2) improve health-related quality of life; and 3) increase survival time and decrease total cardiovascular hospitalizations compared with furosemide. The specific aims of the TRANSFORM-HF Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) and Data Coordinating Center (DCC) are to (1) Develop and administrate a clinical trial organization to efficiently coordinate study conduct and analysis; (2) Implement and monitor a ?real-world?, large-scale, pragmatic, clinical-effectiveness study using streamlined data acquisition with call center follow-up, and (3) Disseminate the trial results and implications to a broad audience and serve as a prototype for future pragmatic clinical trials. Our prospective, unblinded, 2-arm, phase III clinical trial of 6,000 hospitalized HF patients targeting robust enrollment of racial and ethnic minorities and women will randomize subjects 1:1 to either oral torsemide or furosemide prior to discharge. Enrollment will occur at 50 US hospital sites with established HF clinical excellence. A systematic data acquisition approach will minimize investigator and subject burden and use a call center at 6 and 12 months to document vital status, medication adherence, and health-related quality of life, and to acquire hospitalization information. The TRANSFORM-HF trial will be led by investigators and an operations team with substantial experience and expertise in HF care, clinical trials, data integration and administration working within the highly proven environment of the Duke Clinical Research Institute. This application is submitted as two clustered R01 grant proposals which detail a CCC (PI-Dr. Velazquez) and a DCC (PIs-Drs. Anstrom and Eisenstein). This proposal presents the DCC application."
"9360120","Project Summary Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by repetitive and stereotyped be- havior and dif?culties in communication and social interaction. It is now one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders in childhood, but it is also a lifelong condition, adversely affecting an individual's social relationships, independence and employment well into adult. A major barrier to creating effective treatments for autism is the lack of understanding of the speci?c brain mechanisms involved and how these are related to speci?c behavioral symptoms.  We propose to develop novel statistical methods for combining heterogeneous imaging and behavioral data to understand how properties of complex brain networks give rise to behavioral phenotypes in autism and other neuropsychiatric disorders. The ?rst contribution of this project is to develop novel image analysis methods to extract individualized features of complex brain networks from imaging data. This includes powerful method for describing the shape of gray matter in brain networks based on diffeomorphic image registration and a rigorous method for inferring an individual's functional connectivity based on a hierarchical Bayesian model. The next contribution is a novel method to capture the topology of brain networks simultaneously across all scale levels of connection strength. Finally, we will develop Bayesian statistical methods for ?nding correlations in high- dimensional and heterogeneous data, and we will use this to analyze the relationship between brain networks and behavior. This project includes a strong collaborative and multi-disciplinary team with expertise in computer science, statistical data analysis, neuroimaging, and clinical autism care. A primary goal of this project is to create open-source software that is used by the neuroscience community to advance research in understanding the brain basis of behavior in neuropsychiatric disorders."
"9323432","Project Abstract Biomedical Research Core 3: PKD Biomarkers Core (Core Director: Darren Wallace)  The Biomarkers Core will support investigators in biomedical research involved in the discovery, validation and development of biomarkers for early PKD. The long term goal of the core is to establish a panel of blood and/or urine biomarkers that provide a minimally invasive approach to predict early PKD progression and to monitor the response to clinical treatment. N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and cystatin-C, factors elevated by renal injury, are being considered as potential biomarkers for PKD and other forms of chronic kidney disease. A biomarker panel for the detection of these proteins, in addition to novel PKD specific factors, will be needed for sufficient sensitivity to reliably detect changes in early PKD, prior to overt decline in functional renal mass. The lack of sensitive and specific biomarkers for early PKD, at a time when clinical intervention would be most effective, is a major impediment in monitoring the response to potential therapies. The PKD Biomarkers Core will establish and maintain a repository of PKD biospecimens and patient data for investigators engaged in biomarker discovery and development. Samples will be collected from ADPKD patients and normal individuals in a longitudinal cohort study. Patients with early stages of PKD and relatively normal renal function, identified by sonography or prior MRI for total kidney volume (TKV) measurement and estimated GFR, will be enrolled in the study. Patients with a family history of PKD, but have not had a previous TKV measurement will receive a sonogram to determine eligibility prior to obtaining a baseline MRI. High quality biospecimens, including plasma, serum, DNA, urine, and urinary exosomes, as well as BUN and creatinine, will be collected annually and TKV will be determined every two years. Clinical information on medical history, current medications, risk factors, family history, co-morbidities, smoking history and caffeine and alcohol intake will be collected by a nurse coordinator. The Biomarkers Core will work with existing cores at the University of Kansas Medical Center, including the KU Cancer Center Biospecimen Repository Core Facility, Heartland Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (CTSU and Biostatistics Core), PKD Clinical Research Core, and the PKD Research Biomaterials and Cellular Models Core, and will work with Myriad-RBM, Inc. to develop a new multi-analyte biomarker panel for PKD."
"9346738","Our goal is to leverage our exciting ?SBIR Phase 1 equivalent? research results into a novel nucleoside based treatment for Zika virus (ZIKV) that can be used for prevention or treatment of ZIKV infection. Our lead molecule, RBS1069, is the first potent and specific inhibitor of ZIKV replication (EC50 0.48 micromolar; CC50 > 100 micromolar) and that is suitable for the development of both oral and intravenous dosage forms. RBS1069 is a prodrug that improves delivery of the nucleoside 4AU to infected cells. 4AU has already shown safety in chronic toxicity studies in rats and monkeys and in a Phase 1 clinical study performed in healthy volunteers and HCV patients at doses up to 2000mg and up to 2 week treatment duration. We now seek to develop RBS1069 as an improved prodrug of 4AU into a clinical stage drug by: 1) optimizing the process chemistry route to synthesize larger quantities of RBS1069, and synthesizing scale up batches to support in vitro and in vivo characterization (30g and 300g); 2) completing the antiviral characterization of RBS1069 in vitro and in vivo in ZIKV mouse models and in vitro resistance characterization including the testing against available ZIKV strains in cell culture including multiple primary human cells, determining efficacy in protecting mice from systemic spread of infection, infection of pregnant mice and impact of timing of treatment start, passaging RBS1069 in Huh-7 cells at increasing drug concentrations to select resistant ZIKV variants and generating recombinant ZIKV polymerase to confirm resistance mutations; 3) determining key in vitro pharmacology and preclinical safety parameters of RBS1069, including permeability in Caco-2 cells and cytotoxicity in primary human cells and formation and half-life of 4AU triphosphate in human target cells, and in animal cells (mouse, rat, dog); 4) determining the in vivo pharmacokinetics and initial toxicity profile of RBS1069 in single dose PK studies in two species (rats and dogs), in in vitro safety, genotoxicity and ADME studies (including CYP and transporter inhibition assays, hERG inhibition, AMES, MNT, chromosomal aberration testing, metabolic stability), and safety (CV, respiratory, and CNS) profiling and 7-day non-GLP toxicity studies; 5) synthesizing a 4kg GMP grade batch of RBS1069 and perform 2 week GLP toxicity studies and safety pharmacology studies to enable IND. Our team is highly experienced in successful drug discovery and development. In addition, this team is expert in the synthesis and characterization of selective, efficacious and safe nucleoside analogs for viral diseases. This team is therefore well positioned to deliver a highly innovative potent, selective, well tolerated, easy to use inhibitor of ZIKV replication, targeting the ZIKV polymerase with high barrier to resistance capable of providing prophylactic and therapeutic protection against this serious pathogen."
"9240787","One of the goals of the Integrative Neuroscience Initiative on Alcoholism (INIA)-Neuroimmune consortium is to understand brain immune signaling systems and their role in the causes and treatments of alcohol dependence. As part of INIA, we have identified the receptor tyrosine kinase, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and its putative secreted ligand midkine (MDK), as novel signaling proteins that may be involved in alcohol use disorders. ALK and MDK are known to signal through immune response pathways in the body, but the roles of ALK and MDK in immune signaling specifically in the brain in response to ethanol have not been examined. The objective of the first Specific Aim of this project is to identify ethanol-responsive MDK- and ALK-dependent neuroimmune signaling pathways in the brain using MDK and ALK inhibitors. This will be done by treating mice either with a single dose of ethanol or allowing mice to drink alcohol. Phosphorylation of proteins involved in neuroimmune signaling pathways will be measured in the first experiment. In the second experiment, expression of genes encoding cytokines and chemokines will be tested. In the third experiment, activation of microglia, the resident immune cells in the brain, and astrocytes, which are activated by inflammatory processes, will be examined.  Small-molecule inhibitors targeting ALK are effective in reducing binge-like drinking in mice, suggesting that ALK is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of alcohol use disorders. The mechanism(s) through which ALK acts to regulate excessive drinking are not well understood. Evidence from our INIA work suggests that ALK might act in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), a key brain region involved in ethanol dependence, to regulate excessive ethanol consumption and GABA neurotransmission. The goal of the second Specific Aim of this project is to test for effects of MDK and ALK manipulation in the CeA on these two parameters. Three experiments will be performed. The first involves viral delivery of short hairpin RNAs targeting ALK or MDK directly into the CeA. In the second and third experiments, we will infuse ALK and MDK inhibitors, or recombinant MDK protein, into the CeA. Mice will be tested for binge-like ethanol consumption and for GABA-mediated inhibitory currents by electrophysiology after infusion.  Another goal of INIA-Neuroimmune is to use new technologies to study neural circuits involved in the development of excessive alcohol drinking. To this end, the objective of the third Specific Aim is to develop and produce cutting-edge viral vectors for INIA investigators for selective knockdown, knockout, or overexpression of genes. These vectors will be provided to INIA investigators for delivery to specific brain regions involved in alcohol dependence. This will allow for the identification of the neural pathways in which INIA candidate genes function to control alcohol drinking. This proposal involves numerous interactions with INIA-Neuroimmune investigators and will assist in the achievement of the goals of the consortium."

"9298396","ABSTRACT  Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability (ID). It is a significant medical and social problem because the incidence remains at one in ~700-1000 live births worldwide, and while cognitive deficits can be mild, the average IQ is 40-50. It is challenging to model DS adequately in mice because orthologs of the ~160 conserved Hsa21 protein coding genes map to three mouse chromosomes: Mmu16, 17 and 10. Here, we propose to study the Dp(10)1Yey mouse model of DS (abbreviated Dp10) that is trisomic for ~40 Hsa21 orthologs, the entirety of the Mmu10 syntenic region. Individual genes trisomic in the Dp10 affect learning and memory, astrocyte activation, cerebellar development, activity of sex hormone receptors, and/or produce sex-specific phenotypes in null mutants. Little is known however about the consequences for learning/memory (LM), and therefore, the DS cognitive phenotype, of simultaneous trisomy of the entire gene set. The single published study of Dp10 LM analyzed the performance only of 2-4 month old male mice and only in the Morris Water Maze (MWM) and context fear conditioning (CFC), and found no impairment. In contrast, in Preliminary Results, we demonstrate that, using a weaker training protocol for CFC, 3 month old male Dp10 are indeed impaired, but that females learn normally. We also show that protein expression in brains of both 3 and 8 month old Dp10 mice includes significant abnormalities in levels of components of MTOR, MAPK and apoptosis pathways, and in glutamate receptor subunits. Furthermore, the brain region-specificity of the abnormalities predominantly affects hippocampus in males and cerebellum in females. These sex differences are important because sex differences in cognitive profiles of people with DS have been reported, with males more severely impaired than females on multiple tests. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that Hsa21 orthologs of Mmu10 indeed contribute to the DS cognitive phenotype, specifically that the Dp10 mice have LM deficits, that these derive from perturbed function of brain regions in addition to or other than hippocampus, and that they differ between males and females.  To test these hypotheses, we propose the following specific aims: Aim 1. We will assay male and female trisomic Dp10 and littermate controls at ~3 months of age for performance in LM tasks that require cerebellum, striatum, prefrontal cortex, and perirhinal cortex, as well as hippocampus. Aim 2. To uncover potential age related deficits, we will repeat the LM assays from Aim 1 in Dp10 mice at ~10 months of age.  Results of these experiments will identify sex-specificities in the role in the DS cognitive phenotypes of the ~40 Hsa21 orthologs mapping to Mmu10. Such information is essential for rational design of preclinical evaluations of drugs for cognition in DS."
"9379694","Parkinson?s disease (PD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder that progresses silently (without clinical manifestations) for years prior to onset of the first symptoms of PD-associated motor dysfunction. The vast majority of PD cases (about 85%) are idiopathic (idPD), and currently, there are no specific biomarkers for early diagnosis of this devastating disease in aging humans. Recent discoveries in Dr. Bolotina?s lab (Zhou et al, Nature Communications, 2016) resulted in identification of the previously unknown defect(s) in PARK14 / PLA2g6- dependent Ca2+ signaling (PLA2g6/Ca2+), which could be detected in peripheral cells from idPD patients, and may be used for development of a brand new biomarker strategy. We also established that such defects lead to progressive demise of dopaminergic neurons and development of age-dependent PD-like motor dysfunction in a new mouse model that closely mimics idPD in humans. Importantly, we found a strong association of human idPD with significant loss of PLA2g6(L) expression/function and impairment of the store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), which we could detect in primary skin fibroblasts (PSFs) from a pilot group of idPD patients.  Here we hypothesize that signature defects in PLA2g6/Ca2+ signaling in platelets and/or PSFs could be used as a novel biomarker for detection of idPD in aging humans. We are seeking support for a pilot program that will focus on validation of the specificity of our new PLA2g6/Ca2+-based biomarker, and will test the feasibility of using these biomarkers in human platelets and/or skin fibroblasts as a novel approach for detection of idPD. Our research team is uniquely qualified for proposed studies: Dr. Bolotina (PI) has unique knowledge and established experimental platform for validation of PLA2g6/Ca2+ biomarkers in the pilot groups of human subjects, and Dr. Saint- Hilaire (clinical Co-Investigator) is currently involved in the Parkinson?s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) study, and has a well-established platform for donor recruitment and sample collection. All approaches are established and published by PI and Co-Investigator. Preliminary data fully support our hypothesis and demonstrate feasibility of our proposal. Specific Aims of our proposal are:  Aim 1: To validate specificity of the signature PLA2g6/Ca2+ defects for idPD using existing samples of primary skin fibroblasts from NINDS repository. Expression and function of PLA2g6(L), store-operated Ca2+ entry and ER Ca2+ levels will be analyzed using molecular, biochemical, and imaging techniques, and compared in fibroblasts from the patients with idPD, familial PD (mutations in LRRK2 or GBA), Alzheimer?s disease, Huntington?s disease, and control non-neurologic donors. All samples will be obtained from NINDS human cell and data repository.  Aim 2: To test if the signature defects in PLA2g6/Ca2+ signaling could be detected in platelets from idPD patients. The samples of live platelets and skin fibroblasts will be obtained from a pilot group of aged patients diagnosed with early stages of idPD, and compared with the age-matched group of control non-neurologic donors. PLA2g6/Ca2+ signaling will be analyzed using molecular, biochemical, and imaging techniques."
"9370466","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Shift work disorder (SWD) is a significant threat to public health and safety; over 6 million shift workers in the United States experience the debilitating symptoms of excessive sleepiness and insomnia, and suffer functional impairments that increases the risk of catastrophic industrial accidents. However, patients with SWD are often inadequately treated because the pathophysiology is not well-characterized, and current diagnostic assessments do not identify specific treatment targets. Consequently, clinicians are unable to deliver precise interventions that target the underlying causes of SWD. The proposed project in this career development award will address these gaps by taking the initial steps of translating two phenotypes of SWD for clinical use. Previous research has indicated that SWD can arise from two independent pathways that can be categorized as pathophysiological phenotypes. The first is the circadian misalignment phenotype, characterized by poor adjustment of the biological clock to the nocturnal work schedule. The second is the sleep reactivity phenotype, characterized by a trait vulnerability to sleep disturbance triggered by environmental stressors. Both phenotypes lead to symptoms of sleepiness and insomnia in SWD, and is not currently distinguished in the clinic; however, the requisite treatments for each pathophysiological phenotype are entirely different. As such, the appropriate intervention of SWD requires that these phenotypes be adequately characterized and identified in the clinic. The proposed aims will complete the requisite foundational research to launch the translation of these phenotypes of SWD for clinical use. The first research aim will examine the stability of each phenotype in shift workers to characterize them as either state or trait phenotypes, which will impact both assessments of interventions. The second research aim will identify the specific clinical attributes that can be used to index the phenotypes in a brief, accurate, and cost-effective assessment tool. Finally, the third research aim will identify differences in cognitive and performance deficits between the two phenotypes so that accidents and injuries can be preempted with targeted interventions.To successfully complete the research aims, and to support my long term goal of conducting translational research to improve the health and productivity of shift workers, this career development award will provide further training in the following areas: (1) development of clinical screening tools, (2) advanced methodologies in clinical and translation research, (3) feasibility of ?real-world? behavioral interventions for shift work disorder, and (4) advanced field measurement of circadian phase. In combination, the training activities outlined in this career development award will provide the necessary expertise for a sustained career in translational research and circadian medicine."
"9356948","Project Summary ? Project 2 This project has three aims addressing new aspects of transcription regulation. The first aim investigates the processes responsible for variation among cell states, such as those found in tumors, with a focus on the role of microRNAs (miRNAs). Data from single cell RNA sequencing provides new windows into these processes. In a cell population some genes vary in mRNA expression while others are uniform. Networks of co-varying genes define a range of possible transitional cell states. Elucidation of the structure of these networks will provide insights into the heterogeneity of cancers. The relationship between miRNA activity in embryonic cells and networks of pluripotent genes will be investigated in Aim 1, Definition of biological variation in gene networks due to microRNAs, with future focus on collaborations with the Jacks and Lees labs. The second aim investigates mechanisms underlying transcriptional variation. A liquid-liquid phase or, more specifically, gel-sol phase transition model is proposed as central to interactions between enhancers and promoters. This quantitative model predicts highly cooperative transitions for changes in the valences of interactions between macromolecules. The model is motivated by the high sensitivity of super-enhancers to inhibitors of general transcription factors. These inhibitors are now being tested in treatment of cancer. The relationship between super-enhancers and miRNA expression provides an experimental context to investigate the model, particularly the activity of super-enhancers in the efficient processing of primary miRNA and how human cancers with poor survival gain super-enhancers at genes for oncogenic miRNAs. Investigation in Aim 2, Regulation of transcription and RNA processing by super-enhancers and gel-sol phase transition biology, may enable identification of new cancer therapy targets. The third aim is a collaboration with Jackie Lees' lab analyzing the role of inhibition of the arginine dimethylase PRMT5. Lees' lab has found that glioblastoma cells vary dramatically in sensitivity to a small-molecule inhibitor of PRMT5. Establishing the bases of this differential sensitivity could allow identification of patients who would therapeutically benefit from PRMT5 inhibition. PRMT5 dimethylates residues in Sm proteins that comprise the snRNPs critical for spliceosome function. Analysis of RNA-seq data following inhibition of PRMT5 revealed a dramatic increase in ?detained? introns for a subset of genes and a decrease in the corresponding mRNAs. This will be investigated in Aim 3, Tumor sensitivity to PRMT5 inhibition through splicing regulation and snRNP."
"9330425","ABSTRACT ? Project 2 (Knechtle, Project Lead) While perioperative immune cell depletion with either polyclonal antibody or alemtuzumab is used in the majority of renal transplants in the U.S., our lab has shown in both humans and non-human primates (NHP) that homeostatic repopulation following depletion is associated with B cell activation, elevated BAFF levels, and de novo donor-specific alloantibody (DSA). We have also shown that Belatacept is capable of suppressing such DSA in NHP following depletion. Recently, we have shown in a presensitized NHP model that blockade of CD28 and CD154 in combination with proteasome inhibition substantially lowers alloantibody levels pre-transplant, disrupting germinal centers and lowering plasma cell numbers. However, depletion of plasma cells by proteasome inhibition alone is also associated with germinal center and Tfh cell activation. Thus, depletion of immune cells leads to both beneficial and deleterious consequences with respect to tolerance. This project seeks to define the elements of immune cell depletion in sensitized hosts that foster tolerance. We believe that lymphocyte and plasma cell depletion and subsequent homeostatic repopulation present both an opportunity to shape the alloreactive immune repertoire to favor tolerance, and a risk to disrupt regulation, ignite viral infection and induce activation of alloreactive clones. We hypothesize that the consequences of immune cell depletion in sensitized hosts create compensatory responses by the immune system that are predictable and need to be therapeutically controlled to promote tolerance. To explore this hypothesis, we propose 3 specific aims: 1) To develop safer and more effective means to lower the amount and number of allospecific antibodies, plasma cells, and memory B cells that prevent allotransplantation using proteasome inhibition together with complementary adjuvant therapies prior to renal transplantation; 2) To reshape the immune repertoire using depletion, donor-specific transfusion, and rapamycin to promote regulation, AICD, and pro-tolerant homeostatic repopulation in the sensitized recipient; and 3) To evaluate the safety and efficacy of Belatacept with and without Rapamycin as components of post-transplant immunosuppressive regimens promoting long-term survival of renal allografts following desensitization therapy as described in SA1 and 2 above."
"9252872","Summary/Abstract  The overall objective of this project is to test and prioritize aminospectinomycin (amSPC) antibacterials for use as broad-spectrum agents against bacterial sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). The amSPCs, like their parent antibiotic, spectinomycin (SPC), act by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis by binding to a ribosomal site that is unique among aminoglycosides and other protein synthesis inhibitors. Gonorrhea, caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae, is a STD that afflicts only humans. The disease can be asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease and, ultimately, infertility or may disseminate, causing joint and skin manifestations. Therapeutic options consist of ceftriaxone (250 mg intramuscular in a single dose) plus azithromycin (1 gram orally in a single dose) or doxycycline dosed orally for 7 days. N. gonorrhoeae has acquired resistance to all agents that have been used as therapy, from the 1930s when sulfonamides were used as monotherapy until current times where resistance is developing to ceftriaxone and other extended-spectrum cephalosporins. Infections caused by Chlamydia trachomatis are even more prevalent than gonorrheal infections and, although antibiotic resistance is a smaller problem, people with chlamydial infections are often co-infected with other sexually transmitted bacterial pathogens such as Treponema palladum (syphilis), Haemophilus ducreyi and Mycoplasma genitalium. New small molecule drugs, especially those with synergy with new or existing antibiotics, rendering them useful for combination therapy, are desperately needed and the drug pipeline is very limited. We have discovered a series of novel amSPCs, which are derivatives of SPC, a second-line gonorrhea agent still in use outside of the United States. The structure-activity data available to date demonstrates an excellent (8-32-fold) improvement in in vitro potency compared to SPC and low cytotoxicity against multiple cell lines. The amSPCs represent a safe potential new treatment option for drug resistant gonorrhea and bacterial co-infections. The low oral bioavailability of the amSPCs suggests that they would be administered parenterally, as is standard for aminoglycoside anti- gonorrheal drugs and the current standard-of-care, cefriaxone. The goal of this Phase I research project is to develop the amSPCs as a parenteral therapy for the treatment of bacterial STDs by 1) maintaining potency against N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis, 2) showing efficacy against other bacterial STDs and 3) demonstrating efficacy in a mouse model of gonorrhea. Our strategy is to evaluate and prioritize existing analogs (>100) to demonstrate a broad-spectrum potency against bacterial STD species, maintain low toxicity against mammalian cell lines and maintain or improve in vivo efficacy. In Phase II, we will evaluate the in vivo efficacy of the lead compounds emerging from Phase I in additional murine models of Ng infection and Ng-Ct co-infection and conduct pharmacokinetic and toxicology studies to establish an in vivo safety index and select the final broad-spectrum STD candidate suitable for IND-enabling preclinical GLP studies."
"9314128","PROJECT SUMMARY This K01 proposal, ?mHealth Intervention via Mentors: Preventing Substance Use, Sexual Risk, and Violence among Inner City Baltimore Youth through Technology-Enhanced Mentoring,? addresses two fields of study relevant to adolescent health that deserve further attention, particularly in how they can intersect to improve public health: youth mentoring and mobile health (mHealth) prevention interventions. Adolescents growing up in low-income urban areas such as Baltimore are at particularly high risk for unhealthy practices such as substance use, sexual risk, and engagement in violence. For adolescents who lack socially protective resources such as parents, attentive teachers, or community networks, mentors can play a significant role in helping to reduce stress, prevent negative health behaviors, and model positive health behaviors. However, little is known about the pathways by which mentee health behavior change occurs, especially for the prevention of substance use, how matched mentors can effectively communicate health promotion messages, or how mHealth technology might be leveraged to enhance existing mentoring models. Utilizing knowledge and training gained through this award in the areas of adolescent substance use, mHealth interventions, and analysis of dyadic and ?big? social media and smartphone data, the goal of the proposed study is to develop a prevention intervention in the form of a smartphone application (app), as well as training materials for using the app, to enhance existing mentoring models for highly vulnerable African American male adolescents in urban Baltimore. The training, professional development, and pilot data gained under this award will allow me to propose an R01 to conduct a naturalistic study or randomized controlled trial to measure effect sizes in the reduction of substance use and related health risk behaviors among mentored adolescent males. Support under a K award and the linked career development experiences will allow me to become an independent investigator focused on a new area of expertise?substance use prevention with urban American youth using mHealth?and to learn the skills required for successfully pursing NIH research funding. My long-term career goal is to answer the following research questions: 1) How can mentoring help improve health outcomes for at-risk adolescents and reduce health disparities in adulthood? and 2) How can mHealth be used in prevention intervention with this population? Fully understanding how to set up a systematic research program that intersects the fields of youth mentoring and effective mHealth intervention has great potential to lead me towards an innovative and productive independent research career in a new area. My intermediate career goals under this training grant are to focus work locally with African American adolescent males in Baltimore City, understand how technology-enhanced mentoring can serve as a universal prevention tool for urban male adolescents, build capacity to analyze dyadic data and data produced by social media and smartphone applications, and to develop collaborations with leading investigators in substance use prevention, youth mentoring, and mHealth research."
"9380678","Asthma is a common chronic illness with higher rates of hospitalization for exacerbation than many other chronic conditions. Standard treatment for acute asthma includes systemic corticosteroids to suppress inflammation. However, the benefits of systemic steroids are not effective for several hours after administration and do not target neutrophilic inflammation, a shared feature of both viral- and allergen-induced exacerbations. Currently there is an urgent need for treatments that work quickly and effectively in acute asthma exacerbations, characterized by increased airway hyper-reactivity, neutrophilic and eosinophilic inflammation, and mucous secretion with impaired clearance. We hypothesize that parenteral interventions targeted at inflammatory cytokines implicated in acute asthma may prove to be useful adjuncts to standard treatment of exacerbations. Our studies with allergic asthmatics have shown enhanced airway IL-1? responses after exposure to pollutants. Numerous studies in murine models of allergic asthma indicate that IL-1? is a central mediator of airway reactivity, granulocyte recruitment, mast cell activation, and mucus hypersecretion; however, the exact source of IL-1? has yet to be elucidated. Thus, IL-1 blockade presents a novel and targeted strategy to treat broad features of an exacerbation. Anakinra is a FDA-approved IL-1 receptor antagonist with a fast onset of action and short half-life. We have successfully and safely used anakinra in reducing neutrophilic airway inflammation after environmental endotoxin challenge in healthy volunteers. Using a model of inhaled allergen challenge frequently used to test novel asthma therapies, we will test the central hypothesis that IL-1 blockade with anakinra will reduce three features of asthma exacerbations in subjects with allergic airway disease: airway hyperreactivity, inflammation, and mucous secretion and clearance. Aim 1 will test if IL-1 blockade mitigates allergen-induced bronchial reactivity. Aim 2 will test if IL-1 blockade mitigates allergen-induced bronchial inflammation. Aim 3 will test if IL-1 blockade mitigates allergen-induced mucus secretion and slowed clearance. We will be the first to determine if anakinra alleviates these key features of asthma exacerbations using two dosing schemes that reflect potential asthma rescue regimens. These proof-of-concept studies are essential to the development of well-designed clinical trials that can test if this therapy is a useful adjunct in exacerbations of respiratory disease for use in emergency care settings."
"9378904","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Therapy & Research Center (CTRC) seeks renewal of its NCI designation originally awarded in 1991. The only academic Cancer Center in South Texas, the CTRC serves a large and predominantly Hispanic catchment area. The mission of the CTRC is to reduce the cancer burden in South Texas through the highest quality cancer care, ground-breaking research aimed at reducing the incidence and mortality of cancer, education of future cancer scientists and clinicians, and cancer prevention programs focused on our unique population. Dr. Ian M. Thompson, Jr., Director of the CTRC and the CTRC Senior Leaders have organized an interdisciplinary group of 78 cancer researchers (both basic and clinical) from two schools and 11 Departments within the UTHSCSA into three Programs: Cancer Development and Progression (CDP), Experimental and Developmental Therapeutics (EDT) and Cancer Prevention and Population Science (CPPS). These Programs are supported by 7 Shared Resources: Genomics, Next Generation Sequencing, Macromolecular Structure and Interactions, Mass Spectrometry, Flow Cytometry, Optical Imaging and Biostatistics. The CTRC also requests support for its Clinical Trials Office (CTO). Since 2008, improvements in the CTO have led to an increase in accruals, but importantly, an increase in interventional trials from 394 accruals in 2008 to 796 accruals in 2012. The CTRC has also made efforts to serve its catchment area illustrated by the fact that 46% of patients enrolled in interventional therapeutic clinical trials are Hispanic.    Today, the UTHSCSA has $30,681,682M in annual total extramural research funding; a 74% increase from 2008. Of that $8,948,865M is from the NCI. Since 2008, 31 cancer-related clinical and research faculty have been recruited to the CTRC. All but one of the CTRC Senior Leaders are new since 2008. In 2011, UTHSCSA added 25,000 sq.ft. of CTRC-designated space in the new South Texas Research Facility, increasing CTRC-designated space to 285,193 sq.ft. The CTRC also invested in administrative infrastructure to support the CCSG and the research enterprise at the CTRC, in pilot funds for transdisciplinary research, and infrastructure to support clinical trials. The growth of the CTRC over the past 5 years is evidence of the commitment of the Center and its members to cancer research. Our members continue to make significant contributions to the cancer research field and develop novel approaches to prevent, diagnose and treat cancer, all with a continual focus on the predominantly Hispanic catchment area we serve."
"9379193","Project Summary/Abstract:  Therapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (TIPN) is a very common and often dose-limiting side effect of anti-cancer therapy. Clinically, TIPN is a predominantly sensory peripheral neuropathy characterized by numbness, tingling, and often, neuropathic pain. These symptoms can persist for years after cessation of treatment, and so TIPN can significantly diminish patient's quality-of-life both during and after treatment. Moreover, the development of TIPN often necessitates reducing drug dosage or switching regimens, and therefore limits the effectiveness of anti-cancer therapy. Currently, there are no effective treatments for TIPN. Axon loss is a hallmark of this neuropathy, suggesting that mechanistically distinct chemotherapeutics may feed into a common axonal degeneration program. We have demonstrated that genetic inhibition of SARM1, the central executioner of this core axonal degeneration program, blocks the development of TIPN in a mouse model of vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy. The SARM1 pathway induces axon loss by triggering depletion of the essential metabolic co-factor NAD. Here we seek to block the development of TIPN by countering this loss of NAD in order to maintain axonal health. We also explore mechanisms to block the activation of SARM1 as novel therapeutic strategies for blocking the development of TIPN. Finally, targeting the SARM1 pathway will be a useful treatment for TIPN if manipulating this pathway does not affect tumor growth or chemotherapeutic efficacy. We will explore this using genetic tumor models. If successful, this project will identify novel treatment strategies for the prevention of TIPN."
"9542546","Abstract: Botulinum Neurotoxins (BoNTs) are a large family of protein toxins and are of great significance due to their extreme potency and the severity of the disease they cause in humans and animals. Botulism is a neuroparalytic disease of long duration, lasting up to several months. Without proper medical care, naturally occurring botulism is lethal in up to 50% of cases, and even with respiratory and other supportive care and antitoxin administration, up to 5 % of patients die. While naturally occurring botulism is rare, BoNTs are classified as a Tier 1 Category A Select Agent due to their threat as potential bioterrorist weapons. Amazingly, BoNTs are also widely used in medicine to treat more than 100 neuromuscular disorders and for aesthetic purposes, which is now an over 2 billion dollar industry and is growing. BoNTs are immunologically divided into 7 serotypes, which are further subdivided into subtypes. Today, 100s of BoNT variants have been identified by sequencing efforts, but only few have been investigated at the protein level. It is remarkable that out of all these BoNT variants only two are currently used in the medical field, and studies examining benefits of using other variants are rare. Our RO1 project `Analysis of BoNT/A subtypes' has determined for the first time that subtypes within the BoNT/A serotype have distinct biologic properties, including cell entry kinetics, duration of action, potency, and immunological variations. This renewal project proposes to extend these data to determine on a molecular and structural level the mechanisms underlying these unique properties. Specifically, this project will investigate the mechanisms underlying the shorter duration of action of BoNT/A3, the faster and more efficient cell entry by BoNT/A2, and the 1,000 fold lower potency of BoNT/A4. Our collaborative efforts are unique in this area, as we are able to combine detailed mechanistic studies on subdomains with cell-based and in vivo studies on the holotoxin level. The Barbieri laboratory will use structural modeling to guide extensive mutagenesis studies on functional domains of BoNTs and investigate mechanisms of receptor binding and cell trafficking using neuronal cell models. The Johnson/Pellett laboratory will utilize these data to create targeted holotoxin constructs in their native hosts and conduct detailed investigations in various cell models, including human cell models. Finally, based on the data from these studies, select holotoxin constructs will be investigated in mice to determine the pathologic and pharmacologic consequences of structural alterations. Using this approach, we are able to investigate a large number of amino acid substitutions and select specific alterations for the more effort- and cost-intensive construction of recombinant holotoxins. By utilizing several cell models before conducting in vivo studies, we are able to reduce the number of required animals and also use human specific models. Finally, the combination of in vitro, cell-based, and in vivo studies will provide novel insight into the mechanisms underlying the observed pathologic and pharmacologic properties of these toxins."

"9363017","PROJECT SUMMARY Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a common complication of pregnancy and is linked to the later development of type 2 diabetes (T2D). We have developed an experimental animal model of IUGR caused by uteroplacental insufficiency that affects the development of the fetus by permanently altering susceptible cells, such as ß-cells, and leads to the development of T2D in adulthood. Our preliminary data suggest that the mechanism by which IUGR leads to the development of T2D in adulthood is via a transient activation of the Th2 response in fetal islets resulting in localized inflammation. This is associated with the production of high levels of IL-4 and IL-10 in fetal islets. Although this immune response is short- lived, it results in a permanent reduction in islet vascularity and impaired insulin secretion. However, it is not known which immune cells or T cell subtypes contribute to the production of these Th2 cytokines. As each of these immune cell types have a particular role in immune regulation, it is critically important to determine the phenotypic profile of T cell subsets. Surprisingly, blocking the action of a single Th2 cytokine, IL-4, restores vascularity and ß-cell function permanently in IUGR adult animals. This suggests that IL-4 orchestrates a cascade of events leading to the abnormal ß-cell phenotype in the IUGR animal. Epigenetic mechanisms regulate Th2 cell activation both in the fetus and adult. The Th2 cytokine locus is highly conserved and demethylated in resting normal fetal and neonatal CD4+ cells. Thus, additional epigenetic mechanisms must underlie the exaggerated Th2 effector function in IUGR cells. These findings lead us to hypothesize that IUGR induced expansion of Th2-type effector cells including macrophages and eosinophils occurs via epigenetic mechanisms resulting in permanent ß-cell dysfunction. We propose the following aims: Specific Aim 1: To determine whether fetal IUGR immune cells are functionally distinct from controls resulting in an amplified Th2 response. Specific Aim 2: To define the epigenetic landscape in IUGR fetal and neonatal immune cells. Specific Aim 3: Determine the mechanisms by which IL4 production causes ß-cell dysfunction in IUGR animals. Through the comprehensive analyses in the in vivo model, the results of the proposed project will build a solid standard for extrapolation of effects and mode of action to other types of inflammatory processes that may be identified as potential inducers of obesity and related metabolic diseases later in life. "
"9322614","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Candidate: Dr. Balamuth has clinical training in pediatric emergency medicine, and research training both in immunobiology, having received a PhD through the Medical Scientist Training Program at Yale University, and epidemiology, as she is enrolled in the Masters of Science in Clinical Epidemiology program through the support of an NHLBI K12 award at the University of Pennsylvania. This proposal for a K23 Career Development Award will position the applicant to gain advanced skills in genetic epidemiology and high throughput gene expression studies through the conduct of a prospective study utilizing RNA expression profiling to improve pediatric sepsis recognition in the emergency department. Dr. Balamuth's mentors have expertise in epidemiology and immunology, and will ensure that both the career development and research plan are carried out successfully.  The applicant's current objectives are to improve sepsis recognition in ED patients using both epidemiologic and biologic tools. With 75% of her time dedicated to patient oriented research and her career development, the applicant's short term goals are 1. To complete her K12 studies. These include a study which demonstrates improved outcomes for patients with severe sepsis or septic shock who were recognized rapidly in the ED and treated according to a clinical practice guideline and a study which evaluates a vital sign based electronic alert for sepsis in the emergency department and demonstrates that although the alert is sensitive for identifying sepsis, that it has a high false positive rate and 2. To carry out the studies described in the current proposal.  The applicant's long term career goal is to become an independent academic physician-scientist with an established NIH-funded program to accurately identify pediatric patients with sepsis in the ED setting, and to risk stratify patients so that they receive appropriate and personalized interventions based on their underlying biology, with the ultimate goal of decreasing morbidity and mortality. She will achieve this through emergency medicine based research network sepsis intervention trials using risk stratification through personalized medicine techniques. Achieving these short and long term goals will develop Dr. Balamuth as a leader in the nascent field of translational research in the pediatric ED. Environment: The proposal takes advantage of the extensive resources available to Dr. Balamuth at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine (Penn) by bridging multiple disciplines, schools, and research centers to create a unique program aimed towards developing skills in advanced genetic epidemiology, and high throughput methods. Overall, CHOP and Penn provide a rich environment for research and training. The wealth and diversity of both formal didactic training and opportunities for mentored research experiences, combined with the high clinical volume of a quaternary pediatric emergency department is unique, and create an ideal environment for Dr. Balamuth's ongoing career development. Research: Severe sepsis is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children. There have been significant advances over the past decade, which have demonstrated improved patient outcomes with timely, protocol-based therapies. However, identifying which children require these intensive therapies is challenging. Finding the children at risk for severe sepsis from among the thousands who present to emergency departments each year with common febrile illness is akin to finding a needle in a haystack. Although there have been many studies in the literature investigating candidate biomarkers as both diagnostic and therapeutic targets in sepsis, it has become clear that the complex nature of the human response to sepsis makes single marker strategies unlikely to succeed in facilitating sepsis recognition. RNA expression profiling provides a unique opportunity to gain a broad, high throughput picture in the complex and likely heterogeneous pathophysiology of sepsis, and several preliminary studies have yielded promising results using this technique in predicting both sepsis severity in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) patients as well as etiology of infections in children with fever. The broad long-term objective of this line of research is to improve pediatric sepsis recognition in the emergency department using both clinical predictors and biomarker strategies. As a first step towards achieving this goal, the current proposal focuses on using RNA expression profiling to predict both illness severity and source pathogen in pediatric sepsis. The aims of this proposal are: 1. To determine association between the RNA expression profile and severity of illness during the initial 2 days of hospitalization in pediatri patients with suspected sepsis initially identified in the ED., and 2. To determine association between the RNA expression profile and sepsis source pathogen in pediatric ED patients with suspected sepsis."
"9384342","ABSTRACT Pre-mRNA splicing is an essential component of eukaryotic gene expression. Many metazoans, including humans, regulate alternative splicing patterns to generate expansions of their proteome from a limited number of genes. Importantly, a considerable fraction of human disease causing mutations manifest themselves by altering the sequences that shape the splicing patterns of genes. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which this complex pathway is regulated remain poorly understood. Understanding how disease-causing mutations impair this ability will require improved knowledge of the mechanisms by which the spliceosome correctly identifies and activates ?cognate? splice site sequences in the background of scores of ?near-cognate? aberrant splice sites, and in the context of changing developmental and environmental cues. At the simplest level, this will require understanding both: (1) the cis-regulatory elements within a transcript (or gene structure) that destine it for regulation; and (2) the mechanistic bases by which trans-regulatory factors can impart this specific regulation. To better understand the mechanisms of alternative pre-mRNA splicing, we have chosen to examine the genetically tractable fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe. In many ways, splicing in S. pombe looks similar to splicing in higher eukaryotes. Introns have been identified in nearly half of all S. pombe genes, and single genes are interrupted by multiple introns. The splice site sequences found in S. pombe introns do not conform to tight consensus sequences but rather appear much more like human introns in the nucleotide degeneracy found at these positions, a known hallmark of splicing regulation. Building upon our recent demonstrations that S. pombe can catalyze mammalian-like environmentally-regulated alternative splicing, the goals of our current work are to understand the cis-regulatory elements and trans-acting factors that are necessary for this regulation. Toward this end, we will employ high-throughput genetic tools that we have developed to identify the elements within these transcripts that are required for their regulation. Similarly, we will use a forward genetic approach to identify and characterize the splicing factors that are necessary for these regulated events. The combination of these approaches should provide important insights into the mechanisms by which this organism can regulate its gene expression via this pathway. Given the high level of conservation between splicing in S. pombe and humans, this work is likely to provide critical insights into splicing regulation in higher eukaryotes, including its mis-regulation in many human diseases."
"9321492","Project Summary / Abstract This research project uses novel technology and innovative strategies to discover molecular differences between foveal cones and extrafoveal cells and to identify alterations in photoreceptor cell gene expression in early AMD. A comprehensive interrogation of gene expression in foveal and extrafoveal cones will be important to the field for at least 4 reasons: (1) foveal cones are the most important cells for visual acuity, and hence are critical targets for gene augmentation therapy and a better understanding of their physiology will be important for the development of stem cell directed therapies; (2) foveal cones persist for years in some patients with AMD, leaving a ring scotoma but good acuity, and understanding why they survive may lead to approaches to help rescue other photoreceptor cells from degeneration; (3) rod photoreceptors are likely to yield insight into the delayed dark adaptometry phenotype in AMD; (4) a biological understanding for the morphological differences in foveal and extrafoveal cones is currently lacking. All of these important biological and translational questions will be addressed by the proposed study. The ultimate goal of this research proposal is to identify a set of molecules that can: (1) improve gene augmentation and stem cell directed therapies; (2) determine why foveal cones are alternatively spared or targeted by different retinal diseases; and (3) determine the mechanism underlying the delayed dark adaptation phenotype in AMD patients. These latter outcomes will improve the accuracy of the clinical prognosis for AMD patients, and will lead to new avenues of investigation to delay vision loss, and extend the lifetime of visual acuity in patients with AMD."
"9331694","PROJECT SUMMARY Childhood obesity is a major public health problem that impacts health across the life course. Based on published studies to date, pregnancy weight gain is modifiable and is associated with offspring size and adiposity. However, there is limited evidence regarding the role of the pattern, timing and overall magnitude of pregnancy weight gain on child adiposity development and future cardiometabolic health. The Institute of Medicine revised recommendations for pregnancy weight gain (2009) emphasized the need for research focusing on the pattern and timing of gain in addition to examining effects of total gain. This application addresses this important research area. I am seeking this Pathway to Independence Award to gain additional training in advanced trajectory modeling and human phenotyping to accomplish my career goals of becoming an independent investigator with expertise to rigorously examine the role of maternal nutrition during pregnancy and lactation on both maternal and child health. The training portion of this award includes formal courses, directed readings, apprenticeships, participation in working groups, attendance of seminars and career building activities to gain skills in: 1) longitudinal methods for trajectory analysis; 2) advanced methods for body composition assessment and analysis; 3) dissemination of research findings and grant writing. The research component of this project applies innovative trajectory modeling approaches to examine maternal weight trajectories in pregnancy. I will leverage existing data from the Columbia Children?s Center for Environmental Health Mothers and Newborns Study and the NICHD Fetal Growth Study to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Identify maternal weight trajectories reflecting timing and overall pattern of gestational weight gain using nonparametric trajectory methods and to examine determinants of these trajectories. 2) Examine how maternal weight trajectories relate to child growth, body composition and cardiometabolic health. 3) Conduct a pilot study to evaluate whether maternal fat mass changes are associated with specific maternal weight trajectories during pregnancy and neonatal adiposity. These training and research activities will lead to publications, conference presentations and will prepare me to successfully compete for R01 funding during the R00 phase."
"9299413","PROJECT SUMMARY Recent research has indicated that individuals diagnosed with a major psychiatric disorder are more likely than healthy individuals to select a mate with their own or an alternative psychiatric condition. What role this nonrandom mating may play in the transmission of psychiatric illness, however, remains unclear. Where parents are homotypic for a disorder (e.g., both parents have a diagnosis of schizophrenia), offspring will receive genetic variants from each parent that are related to that disorder ? placing them at particularly high genetic risk for that condition's development. However, this type of compounded genetic risk may also occur in heterotypic pairings (e.g., one parent having schizophrenia, the other bipolar disorder), as many psychiatric conditions share genetic risks. With prior research suggesting that such heterotypic pairings are pervasive in psychiatric populations, understanding the degree to which risks are sustained in these offspring is an important question. The primary goal of this proposal is, therefore, to leverage the unique scale of data available in the Swedish Medical Registers to determine the change in risk for major psychiatric diagnoses, among the offspring of parents who are homotypic or heterotypic for major psychiatric diagnoses, relative to the risk in offspring of single affected or healthy parents. Parents with any of eight major psychiatric diagnoses - attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, obsessive- compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, social phobia, and substance abuse ? will be considered in this work, with the incidence of these conditions in their offspring compared to the incidence in matched population controls. In addition to describing these risks, this project also proposes to examine the degree of overlap in risk variants for a particular condition ? schizophrenia ? among the parents of offspring diagnosed with this condition. If found, this type of molecular correlation would signal a clear mechanism by which a disorder may arise in offspring of homo- or heterotypic pairs, while its absence could suggest a stronger role for environment in shaping these added risks."
"9313011","ABSTRACT. Half of the U.S. adult population has one or more preventable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) including hypertension (HTN) and hyperlipidemia, but only 10% are meeting all of their clinical goals due to suboptimal adoption of guideline recommended care. This is largely because primary care practices and health care systems are struggling to identify which combination of care structures and processes they need to implement to become high performing practices. The objective of this proposal is address this translational gap by developing a reliable, valid, and pragmatic assessment tool that will identify core features of primary care practices that are related to high performance on CVD-related outcomes. Despite a large body of research on practice transformation and improvement, we lack a systematic and scalable approach to identifying which features of primary care infrastructure and processes are associated with better patient outcomes. This lack of a reliable, validated, pragmatic assessment tool to define the practice changes that drive high performance in primary care continues to impede implementation of evidence-based care for chronic disease prevention and the translation of innovations in health care into routine practice. We therefore propose a mixed-methods study combining data analytics, survey techniques in the context of a two-stage Delphi process and qualitative in-depth interviews to delineate and prioritize elements of care structure and processes (e.g., decision support) that are hypothesized to be associated with improvements in CVD-related patient outcomes. We will then develop and validate a measurement tool for identifying gaps in care structures and processes that are amenable to change, and if implemented, will improve CVD-related patient outcomes. A strength of this proposal is collaboration across four Clinical and Translational Science Institutes: (1) New York University School of Medicine (NYUSoM)-Health and Hospitals CTSI (NYU-H+H CTSI), (2) Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) Oregon Clinical Translational Research Institute (OCTRI), (3) Medical University of South Carolina's South Carolina Clinical Translational Institute (SCTR), and (4) the Institute for Clinical and Translational Research at Einstein and Montefiore (ICTR), and six geographically diverse partnering national practice networks that will form the research team for this proposal. The proposed research is significant because it will fill a methodological gap that impedes translation of innovations in health care into routine practice. Findings from use of the assessment tool will therefore provide a much-needed roadmap for building capacity and infrastructure for practice transformation, continuous quality improvement (i.e., adoption and sustainability of innovation) and improvements in population health."
"9323446","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is for the Continuation of the Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network (NASH CRN) clinical center at Saint Louis University. The NASH Clinical Research Network (NASH CRN) has been sponsored by the NIDDK since 2002 with a renewal in 2009. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects one out of three adults and one in five children in North America and is thus an emerging public health issue in the United States. NAFLD, and especially nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), may lead to cirrhosis and primary liver cancer resulting in death or liver transplant thus leading to major increases in health burdens and costs. The NASH CRN is ideally and uniquely positioned to impact the growing public health significance of NASH that can only be addressed via a large research consortium. The primary objective of the NASH CRN is to perform clinical trials of therapeutic agents for NASH and NAFLD in adults and children. A closely linked and high priority secondary objective is to conduct translational research in NASH and NAFLD focusing on the pathogenesis that will provide the basis for understanding the natural history and developing means of better diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and clinical management. In the next phase of the NASH CRN, the adult and pediatric therapeutic trials initiated during the previous funding cycle will be completed and new therapeutic trials, including phase 2a proof of mechanism and phase 2b clinical trials will be initiated to develop evidence-based treatment options that are safe, effective, simple, and inexpensive. The longitudinal cohort of adults and children with NAFLD collected over the past decade will be extended to prospectively define the natural history of the disease, the cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors, and will aid in biomarker discovery and validation. This cohort will also facilitate the development and validation of non-invasive techniques to identify those with NASH/NAFLD, predict who will respond to treatments, and identify factors affecting disease progression. The NASH CRN is poised to continue its major impact on the field and directly advance the mission of the National Institutes of Health to improve the health of the public."

"9330424","ABSTRACT ? Project 1 (Kirk, Project Lead) Kidney transplantation's considerable benefit is offset by the many complications associated with chronic immunosuppressive therapy. Calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-based regimens are used by over 95% of patients, but these indiscriminately impair immune processes, including those that facilitate graft acceptance, and produce significant side effects. Costimulation blockade (CoB), particularly CD28-CD80/86 pathway inhibition, has been shown to promote long-term allograft survival with fewer side effects than CNIs, and recent clinical trials have suggested that lymphocyte depletion fosters CoB-based regimens, not only preventing rejection, but fostering adaptive processes that reduce the needs for immunosuppression with time, and promoting allospecific tolerance. This project seeks to define the elements of lymphocyte depletion that foster CoB-based tolerance. We have shown that lymphocyte depletion, and subsequent homeostatic repopulation, present opportunities to shape the alloreactive immune repertoire to favor tolerance, but also poses risks to disrupt regulation, and ignite viral infection, autoimmunity and activation of alloreactive clones. Our experimental plan seeks to understand these two sides of depletional induction. We hypothesize that the effectiveness of therapeutic lymphocyte depletion is NOT driven by direct elimination of CoB-resistant cells, but rather by creating a stimulus for lymphocyte turnover and thymic output, fostering antigen-specific activation induced cell death (AICD). Viewed this way, the approach to depletion changes from cell elimination, to promoting and managing repopulation, the latter controlled by relative (not absolute), maturation-defined susceptibilities of the residual lymphocyte population to the effects of antigen exposure, secondary lymphoid organ function, and immunosuppression. We posit that these factors are tractable, and can be therapeutically manipulated. To explore this, we propose 3 specific aims: Specific Aim 1: We will define the effects of depletional induction regimens (broad polyclonal or targeted monoclonal antibody mediated depletion) in rhesus monkeys undergoing kidney transplantation, comparing the effects of CNIs and mTOR inhibitors on homeostatic repopulation, and relate these to the efficacy of belatacept-induced tolerance. Specific Aim 2: We will define the impact of thymic or splenic resection or irradiation on homeostatic repopulation of allospecific cells. Specific Aim 3: We will define the impact of donor and viral (CMV) antigen exposure on repopulation and tolerance, providing prolonged donor antigen in the form of bone marrow or mesenchymal stem cells, and studying these regimens in CMV naïve animals, animals with thymic irradiation. All studies will be heavily mechanistically supported to assess the phenotype, specificity and function of the repopulating repertoire. We will partner with Project 2 to define the impact of these maneuvers on alloantibody formation, and matrix the results in the Project with those of Project 2 to establish a paradigm to guide the development of an optimized depletional regimen to pair with CoB."
"9389170","For diseases without safe and long-term effective therapies, such as obesity, human genetics offers an unbiased route to biological insights that may provide valuable new therapeutic hypotheses. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated both known and novel genes for many polygenic traits, including obesity. However, moving from genetic discovery to biological insight requires overcoming some key hurdles. Because associations from GWAS typically identify clusters of correlated noncoding variants, associated loci typically do not pinpoint either specific regulatory elements or causal genes. In addition, little is known about the function of most genes, so it is often difficult to recognize the biological implications of new discoveries. Fortunately, there is a path forward ? considering associated loci in combination can reveal shared biology and causal genes not apparent from any individual association ? but powerful computational methods and large numbers of associated loci are needed for this approach to work. For height, a model polygenic trait with many known loci, this approach highlights many relevant pathways and genes, both known and novel. Similar insights have only just begun to emerge when applied to measures of obesity, where there are fewer known loci and likely less well-annotated causal biology. The main goal of these genetic studies is to achieve a clearer view of underlying biology, and progress has been more dramatic for height than for obesity. As such, the current success with height shows the promise for a greatly expanded genetic discovery effort for obesity. This proposal aims to fulfill the promise of human genetics to provide critical insights into the root biological causes of obesity. It builds on the collaborative infrastructure we successfully created within the GIANT consortium and have used to discover most of the common variants known to be associated with anthropometric traits. The work will leverage newly feasible genetic approaches and unprecedented sample sizes to study anthropometric measures of obesity (a major public health problem and unmet medical need) and height (the classical model polygenic trait). To increase the number of genetic discoveries, which is vital to recognizing underlying biology, the proposal encompasses the largest collection of genotyped samples yet assembled (up to 2 million individuals from multiple ancestries), imputed to state-of-the-art reference panels. Association analysis for anthropometric traits will also be performed in large whole genome and whole exome sequence data sets (N>100,000), to discover rare variants that may have larger effects and more precisely pinpoint causal genes/regulatory elements. Computational methods that integrate genetic, expression and epigenetic data will be benchmarked on results from height, and then applied to recognize shared biology across obesity-associated loci and across the allelic spectrum, providing insights into likely causal genes and mechanisms. Finally, Mendelian randomization will be used to infer causal relationships between obesity and circulating metabolites, to define metabolic consequences of obesity as well as new therapeutic opportunities.  "

"9342887","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic wounds are a major threat to public health and the economy and present as a comorbid complication with major diseases in humans. Although the proper healing of cutaneous wounds requires collective and coordinated behaviors of multiple cell types, the rate-determining step is the recruitment and function of dermal fibroblasts, which are directed to invade the wound by a gradient in the concentration of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). A great deal is known about the signal transduction pathways activated by PDGF receptors and other receptor tyrosine kinases; yet mechanistic insights about how those pathways are spatially organized to bias the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton and the directionality of cell migration are still emerging. A still larger fundamental gap lies inthe integration of molecular, supramolecular, cellular, and tissue-level dynamics of wound healing, which span disparate time (seconds to weeks) and spatial (nm to cm) scales. To advance this field, novel approaches are needed to fuse experimental and observational scales that are relatively data-rich (signaling, cytoskeletal dynamics) and data-poor (in vivo dynamics). To that end, we propose to develop a predictive, multiscale model of the proliferative phase of wound healing, incorporating 1) receptor-mediated signal transduction (molecular scale), 2) self-assembly of contractile actomyosin structures (supramolecular scale), 3) morphodynamics and statistics of cell migration (cellular scale), and 4) collective cell behavior in vivo (tissue scal). Our partnership combines expertise in experimental cell biology and biophysical modeling, and model development will be guided by new, quantitative measurements at every scale of biological abstraction."
"9258339","Project Summary The blossoming pharmaceutical field of protein-based ?biologic? drugs has been limited by the immunogenicity these agents can provoke from recipients, presenting an unmet medical need for methods to induce tolerance to these agents. We have recently demonstrated in mice that exposure of naïve T cells to interferon beta can favor their differentiation into either pro-inflammatory Th1 cells or tolerogenic FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), depending on the time interval between interferon exposure and T cell activation. Thus, we postulate that appropriately-timed interferon beta pretreatment can drive T cells into a tolerogenic phenotype upon subsequent exposure to a foreign antigen, such as a biologic drug. We propose to evaluate in humans the effect of in vivo exposure to interferon beta by evaluating the naïve T cells from multiple sclerosis patients who receive this cytokine as part of their regular medical care. We will evaluate the phenotype such cells differentiate into upon activation, as well as their overall transcriptome, at different time points following interferon exposure, to define the appropriate time interval for interferon pretreatment to induce Tregs in humans. We also propose to treat healthy and colitic mice with interferon beta prior to exposure to exogenous antibodies to demonstrate that interferon pretreatment can reduce the immunogenicity of the latter. This work will serve as a necessary preclinical model to support the application of interferon pretreatment as a mechanism to reduce biologic drug immunogenicity in a future clinical trial.   "
"9382062","The challenge in observing the viral infection process in its entirety rests in the difficulty of simultaneously addressing the multiple spatial and temporal scales associated with the process. An extracellular virion can move with speeds up to and exceeding 10 µm2/sec. Meanwhile, these nanoscale particles interact with cells on the 10s of microns scale. These interactions are dictated by the subtle molecular motions of single proteins within the virus and at cellular interfaces at the nanometer and microsecond time scales. Current imaging methods cannot successfully synthesize information at these disparate scales. Cellular imaging methods were developed with intention to focus on a cell or cells and image as rapidly as possible. The overhead associated with imaging such large areas diminishes temporal precision. With this proposal, we aim to develop and apply virus-targeted imaging. These new methods will lock on to single viral particles starting in the extracellular space, following them with photon-limited temporal resolution throughout the entirety of the viral infection pathway. These unprecedented measurements will uncover the transient interactions which underlie the critical infection points, such as the moment of viral landing, the association of ligands and receptors, viral envelope fusion and associated cellular membrane fluctuations responsible for viral uptake. Research Direction 1 will describe the development and implementation of a highly sensitive real-time 3D single particle tracking technique capable of locking on to a single virus particle lightly stained with a fluorescent dye or fluorescent protein fusion. The technique will utilize a rapidly moving 3D laser spot generated by a 2D electro- optic deflector and a tunable acoustic gradient (TAG) lens. The rapidly moving laser spot will tag each photon received from the viral particle with position information. These rapid position measurements will be used to drive a piezoelectric stage to lock on to the viral particle's position, holding it in the objective focal volume while exerting zero force on the particle. This will yield continuous photon-limited observation of the viral particle. Research Direction 2 will merge this continuous observation with 3D volumetric imaging to correlate the behavior of the viral particle with the larger cell environment, enabling measurement of the exact moment of viral landing, as well as the interaction of viral particles with the extracellular matrix. Research Direction 3 will extend this volumetric imaging down to the submillisecond time scale local to the viral particle. This will enable highly rapid measurement of ligand-receptor interactions at the cell surface. Research Direction 4 will probe the viral envelope fusion process to pinpoint the spatiotemporal details of the viral envelope at different stages of the viral life-cycle for pH independent viruses. Taken together, these research directions will carve a new path into the study of viral infection. By discarding the measurement overhead associated with measuring a large 3D cellular surface, these new approaches will probe into uncharted spatiotemporal resolution of the viral infection process."
"9263236","We propose to use unprecedented longitudinal data to define typical and atypical neurodevelopmental trajectories and to study the role of exposures to psychoactive substances and other environmental factors in variations in structural and functional brain development from early childhood through adolescence. Using a unique prospective cohort sample of children whose mothers were first studied during pregnancy, trajectories of brain development will be constructed using longitudinal data from 4000 adolescents participating in the Dutch Generation R (GenR) Study. The GenR cohort was ascertained during gestation and has been assessed repeatedly through 11 years of age to date, including MRI data collection. GenR is uniquely able to provide data to construct trajectories of brain development and to determine if prenatal and early exposures have lasting impacts on neurodevelopment through adolescence. In addition, we can determine if adolescent use of psychoactive substances perturbs neurodevelopment through adolescence in ways that are related to adaptive functioning. Because the inherently non-linear nature of typical and atypical brain- and behavioral development, they can only be understood using longitudinal data. The children have already been assessed through childhood and we will conduct two additional assessment waves during early and late adolescence to continue to map neurodevelopmental trajectories and to study potential variations of these trajectories linked to environmental exposures. Our emphasis will be on the association of trajectories of neurodevelopment with (a) prenatal exposures to psychoactive substance and environmental toxicants during pregnancy, and (b) the use of psychoactive substances by adolescents in the same individuals. To fully understand these exposures, we will evaluate their role in neurodevelopment in the context of a broad range of exposures to the nutritional and social environment. This will allow us to build a comprehensive model of the trajectories of brain development in the context of the child and adolescent?s past and changing environments. Individual differences in trajectories of neurodevelopment will be related to substance use disorders, psychopathology, and adaptive functioning in adolescence. Sex-by-exposure interactions will be tested to ensure that findings are not obscured by sex differences. We will examine resilience in the face of environmental exposures by determining if social and nutritional factors moderate these associations. We will test hypotheses regarding the mediation of exposure-outcome associations by variations in brain structure and function. We will use formal transportability models to validly generalize findings from the GenR cohort to the U.S. All data will be anonymized and shared with the research community in an open science format. 1 UG3 DA 045251-01"

"9353791","PROGRAM SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There are significant disparities that influence prevalence, metabolic control, complication rates, and outcomes in diabetes. Disparities in diabetes are experienced on the basis of: race/ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status, age-related vulnerabilities across the lifespan (both young and older adults), presence of co-morbidities (e.g., depressed persons with diabetes), and geography (e.g., rural vs. urban). Inequities in diabetes are especially pervasive and persistent in the Southeastern United States. Disparities occur, at least in part, due to inadequate capacity building for translating successful diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic modalities for individuals and communities at greatest risk. The Atlanta metropolitan area has a rich and diverse population of Black, Hispanic, and South Asian minorities, low socioeconomic status, and low-access communities who have the highest burdens of diabetes in the country. Therefore, the overall goal of the Georgia Diabetes Translation Research Center's Core D (Disparities) is to facilitate more combined diabetes-disparities translation research that can identify ways to improve engagement in evidence-based diabetes prevention and management interventions among vulnerable populations, and reduce the disproportionately higher risks of morbidity and mortality from diabetes in these groups. To accomplish these goals, Core D has assembled a talented and expert team of Faculty that have tremendous experience in conducting federally-funded disparities and translation research. Core D will expand the spectrum of disparities addressed by including the well-known gender and race/ethnic inequities, but also diabetes throughout the lifespan (e.g., adolescent challenges in medication adherence, gestational diabetes, and older adults that contend with multiple co- existing morbidities), and people with diabetes who have a variety of co-morbidities that dramatically increase their risk of adverse outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, depression, cognitive decline, and HIV. Core D provides methodological expertise, sociocultural competencies, access to populations in community and clinical settings, and relevant databases, tools, and technologies that help investigators explore the drivers of disparities and avenues to address them. Core D leverages Emory University, Georgia Tech, and Morehouse School of Medicine's impressive history of collaboration and longstanding work in disparities research. In particular, these institutions have successfully established large research and community platforms for health equity research with funding from the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the American Heart Association. All of these will be leveraged as platforms for new and ongoing diabetes translation research. Core D offers a comprehensive and diverse set of clinical research environments, ranging from hospitals and clinics, a Veterans Administration hospital, an inner city hospital (Grady Memorial), and community clinics in at-risk neighborhoods. Core D Faculty will be active GDTRC members, contributing to discourse on research, reducing disparities, and disseminating tools and findings."
"9513300","Over the last 15 years, our group has successfully managed the coordinating and bioinformatics unit (CBU) for two NIDDK funded consortia, the Diabetic Complications Consortium (DiaComp 2001-present, formerly the Animal Models of Diabetic Complications Consortium) and the Mouse Metabolic Phenotyping Centers (MMPC, 2006-present). DiaComp provides an environment to foster communications and collaborations between investigator communities involved in diabetic complications research. Toward this goal, DiaComp sponsors annual meetings in complications-relevant scientific areas, solicits and funds pilot projects in high impact areas of complications research, and supports a website to serve the diabetic complications community. During the current five year funding cycle, the CBU was responsible for continuing support for DiaComp through the use of opportunity pools (funding), manage/maintain the website and phenotyping data and administratively organize the meetings and workshops sponsored by the DiaComp to engage the greater diabetic complications scientific community. In contrast, the MMPCs are charged with providing the scientific community with standardized, high quality metabolic and physiologic phenotyping services for the mouse. The MMPC provides state-of-the-art technologies to investigators for a fee, with their services including characterization of mouse metabolism, blood composition (including hormones), energy balance, eating and exercise, organ function and morphology, physiology and histology. Over the last ten years the two consortia have been managed by one CBU because of the NIH decision to integrate the activities of the two consortia during their second funding cycles. Our laboratory has been the CBU for both DiaComp (last 15 years) and the MMPC (last 10 years). The CBU is responsible for creating and maintaining the administrative, scientific and informatics infrastructure necessary to organize and facilitate their operations. The goal of this proposal is to provide that infrastructure. We will build upon the success of the current DiaComp/MMPC CBU infrastructure to provide both DiaComp and MMPC with a robust and comprehensive service oriented solution that supports both the common and unique aspects of each."

"9411966","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Ohio is experiencing one of the worst opioid injection epidemics in the country. The epidemic has severely affected rural Appalachian counties in southern Ohio, leading to a surge in overdose fatalities. Ohio?s heroin- related overdose rate is five times the national rate. In addition to overdose deaths, HCV has increased 400% between 2009-2013 and neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) has increased 9-fold between 2004-2014. Many evidence-based interventions (EBI), such as syringe service programs, medication-assisted treatment for substance use, naloxone provision for overdose treatment, and testing for HCV, HIV and sexually transmitted diseases (STD) are known to be effective in combating injection drug addiction and its consequences. Unfortunately, little is known about how to apply lessons learned in urban injection drug epidemics to sparsely- populated rural areas. In rural Ohio, as in much of the U.S., the delivery of EBI is limited or fragmented. A lack of coordination between key agencies to address overlap and gaps in services, especially in the context of severely constrained resources, has dire consequences for those struggling with opioid injection drug use.  The proposed study will develop and implement a service delivery plan for EBI that can be scaled up in rural Ohio as well as other rural areas in the US experiencing opioid epidemics. In the UG3 phase, we will use a mixed methods approach to assess the socio-cultural and political context of the epidemic across multiple levels, including agencies, health care and service providers, and people who inject drugs (PWID) within three counties in rural Appalachia. We will use respondent-driven sampling (RDS) to assess injection behaviors and HCV, HIV, and STD prevalence. Building on this multi-level formative data, we will identify service gaps and work closely with key community stakeholders to build consensus around and prioritize the most relevant, feasible and acceptable implementation strategies to deliver EBI that may include coalition building, data synthesis across counties, crowdfunding models, and telemedicine. In the UH3 phase, we will implement, monitor and evaluate our service delivery plan for opioid injectors, using a regression point displacement design and repeat RDS surveys. Outcomes will include overdose deaths, NAS cases, HCV and HIV tests performed, and referral for HCV and HIV care. Implementation outcomes will include acceptability, adoption, feasibility, fidelity, penetration, sustainability, and cost. Scalability will be assessed by applying lessons learned in the UG3 phase in three additional counties during the UH3.  Upon completion of the study, we will have enhanced EBI service delivery in multiple counties in Ohio and developed an exportable model of service needs assessment, community-engaged decision-making, and implementation. This model will be suitable for use throughout rural American in settings where opioid addiction has been identified and existing service delivery is limited or fragmented."

"9352686","1: PROJECT SUMMARY Breathing is a complex behavior that is fundamental for life in all mammals. Disturbances in the function and coordination of breathing are common in many disorders of the central nervous system. Thus, the study of specific neural populations that underlie this behavior is not only of great basic science interest, but holds high clinical significance. Lesion experiments and in-vitro studies using transverse brainstem slices have defined the minimal circuitry that is necessary and sufficient for the inspiratory phase of breathing, a small ?kernel? of neurons in the ventrolateral medulla termed the preBötzinger Complex (preBötC). Excitatory neurons derived from cells expressing the transcription factor Dbx1 are thought to form the rhythmogenic ?core? of the preBötC. However, a ?refractory period? for Dbx1 stimulation following each breath limits the ability these neurons to drive a high frequency rhythm in-vitro. The role of this specific population of neurons in controlling the wide range of breathing frequencies common in-vivo is unknown. In this project we will use novel in-vivo and in-vitro approaches conducted in parallel to investigate the role of Dbx1 neurons in the generation of inspiration when embedded in the wider medullary network. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that the inspiratory neural network functions as a distributed column, and is not limited to a defined ?core? region. Inhibition of excitatory Dbx1 neurons effectively drives the inspiratory rhythm through post-inhibitory rebound. And, the refractory period for Dbx1 can be reduced in the distributed inspiratory network to allow faster breathing frequencies by modulating mechanisms of short-term synaptic depression. These hypotheses will be tested using powerful optogenetic, electrophysiological, pharmacological and imaging techniques in anesthetized and freely behaving mice (Aim1) and in a novel horizontal brainstem slice preparation that preserves the wider medullary network bilaterally (Aim2). We expect that integration of these preparations will provide a unique perspective to examine issues that remain unresolved in the field of respiratory rhythm generation."
"9333273","Project 3 Abstract  Immunotherapy has emerged as an exciting new strategy in cancer treatment. The development of antibodies  that can block negative immune regulatory pathways have resulted in clinical improvements in cancer patients  that was not seen previously. Because of this success, there has been strong research and clinical interest in  developing strategies to further improve cancer immunotherapy. One key strategy has been to utilize  radiotherapy to enhance immunotherapy effects. Radiotherapy is thought to increase the antigen exposure to  the immune system. There is also growing preclinical data demonstrating that nanoparticles (NPs) can  enhance immunotherapy by improving antigen presentation.  We hypothesize that we can engineer NPs that can capture the antigens released by radiotherapy and such  NPs can enhance the effects of immunotherapy. We have preliminary data demonstrating that NPs can indeed  capture tumor antigens released from radiotherapy. We have termed these NPs antigen-capturing NPs or AC-  NP. Using a mouse model of melanoma, we have demonstrated AC-NPs, when given in conjunction with  ?CTLA-4 antibody, can improve immunotherapy efficacy. The therapeutic efficacy of AC-NPs are dependent  on the NPs' surface properties. We have also demonstrated that AC-NPs, when injected into tumors after  radiotherapy, can generate systemic immune response against tumor cells in mice.  The central goal of this application is to develop NPs that can effectively capture tumor antigens released by  radiotherapy and evaluate these NPs in cancer immunotherapy. Our application has 3 specific aims:  Aim 1: To optimize the size and surface chemistry of AC-NPs for capturing tumor antigen released from  radiotherapy  Aim 2: To determine whether AC-NPs can enhance the abscopal effect by radiotherapy.  Aim 3: To determine whether AC-NPs' efficacy in enhancing the radiation therapy abscopal effect can be  further improved by the addition of tumor microenvironment modifiers.  To accomplish this goal, we plan to engineer biocompatible and biodegradable NPs with various size and  surface properties. Melanoma will be used as a model disease for our work since it is a disease that has  clearly benefited from immunotherapy. Furthermore, there are well-established mouse melanoma models for  immunotherapy and extensive research using these tumor models.  Our application combines concepts from several disciplines: nanotechnology, immune therapy and  radiotherapy, in developing a novel strategy to improve cancer immunotherapy. Our work can increase the  response rates of cancer immunotherapy which will directly translate into increased cure and survival in  patients. While our work is focused on melanoma as a model, our results may be broadly applied to other  cancers."
"9328189","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose the Mbarara University Training Initiative (MURTI) at the Mbarara University of Science and Technology (MUST) to build the capacity of Ugandan junior faculty to conduct medical research focusing on health care disparities in rural Uganda. Over 90% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa lives in rural settings where health disparities are greatest due to limited access to health care combined with limited education and extreme poverty. With its rural location in southwest Uganda, MUST is uniquely positioned to advance the science needed to improve health in rural SSA - in contrast to most SSA research institutions, which are located in urban centers.  MUST is a public university founded in 1989 that, with more than $3 million in annual research funding, has shown exponential growth in both its research productivity and its pool of developing junior faculty. In the last 5 years, MUST scientific productivity has grown from 30 to 80 publications yearly, generating 300 to 1200 annual citations. Based on this growth, MUST is now ranked among the top 5% of the 1,306 universities on the African continent. However, most of this scientific productivity has come from senior faculty, and there is a pressing need - as well as strong potential - to train the next generation of Ugandan junior faculty researchers.  MURTI training will address three scientific areas of great public health significance in sub- Saharan Africa: HIV/AIDS, cardiovascular diseases, and mental health disorders. This training initiative will also build expertise in researh administration and research ethics. The proposed MURTI is innovative in its focus on building research capacity in rural settings. It will have particular impact because it will leverage $1.5M/year in ongoing NIH, Gates, and philanthropically funded research in partnership with Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) to provide in-depth training to 20 Ugandan junior faculty who will conduct public sector investigation focused rural health issues.  To reach our goal, we propose the following training aims: (1) To develop junior faculty research expertise in HIV prevention and treatment, particularly in rural southwestern Uganda; (2) To build the capacity of Ugandan junior faculty to develop novel, evidence-based diagnostic and treatment strategies for cardiovascular diseases in rural populations; (3) To prepare junior faculty for research careers addressing mental health disorders in rural Uganda; and (4) To equip junior faculty with the administrative, research ethics, and research communications capacities necessary to succeed as the next generation of independent investigators in Uganda. Through these aims, the MURTI will build the capacity of MUST junior faculty to conduct cutting edge social-behavioral, biomedical, and epidemiologic research. These four aims will be supported by technical expertise from leading North American institutions (MGH and the HSPH) that have developed decade-long collaborations with MUST and locally available expertise."
"9360047","ABSTRACT Addiction to therapeutic opioid drugs and heroin has seen a marked increase in the US during the past two decades. In 2014, therapeutic opioid overdose and heroin were responsible for 18,893 and 10,574 deaths respectively. Opioid overdose is the primary driver for drug poisoning, being the leading cause of accidental death in the US, with 47,055 fatalities in 2014. The UCLA Center for Study of Opioid Receptors and Drugs of Abuse (CSORDA) has a focused multidisciplinary preclinical opioid research program with a broader educational and outreach mission in the area of addiction. Mu opioid receptors are targets for many addictive disorders since they are key components for mediating the rewarding effects of opiates, nicotine, cannabinoids, alcohol and food. CSORDA?s research program focuses on elucidating the circuitry and cell-specific adaptations underlying addiction-related behaviors mediated by mu opioid receptors. This CSORDA renewal application (years 31-36) focuses on understanding the circuitry regulating dysphoric states and investigates different opiate addiction susceptibility models, including neuropathic pain, opioid withdrawal and PTSD. The research plan will build upon progress during the past funding period by incorporating several CSORDA-developed innovative genetic mouse models, findings with regards to resting state fMRI imaging, as well as the elucidation of circuitry regulating opioid reward via neuroinflammation and perturbation of D2 enkephalinergic systems. The renewal will use a model of PTSD to examine the marked comorbidity of this disorder with addiction to drugs reliant on the endogenous opioid system for reward-related behaviors. To maintain CSORDA as a technically cutting edge and innovative Center, we have created a Technical Advancement Core (TA-Core) that will enable CSORDA?s research plan to incorporate new technologies optimized and vetted for CSORDA research. Four Research Projects are proposed that are highly interactive, both thematically and technically, and which use shared models, reagents and methods. Projects will focus on different brain circuitry associated with addiction, including the mesolimbic VTA striatal reward system (Projects I and III), the habenula (Projects II and III) and the amygdala (Project IV). Research Projects will explore the modulation of circuitry in models of chronic pain (Project III), withdrawal and depression (Projects I, II and III) and PTSD (Project IV). The research will employ mouse genetics and behavioral analysis combined with electrophysiology, optogenetics, transcript analysis and MRI imaging. In addition to the TA-Core, CSORDA will support an Animal Breeding Core (AB-Core) supplying all CSORDA Projects with mouse models and sharing reagents with the research community. The Administrative Core and CSORDA Advisory Board, consisting of Drs. Bernard Balleine, Antonello Bonci, Charles Chavkin, Pat Levitt, Eric Nestler and Peter Whybrow ex-officio, will provide programmatic oversight and coordinate training, outreach and a vigorous Pilot Program."
"9430664","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R-01 grant proposal is a response to PA-14-112 A Family-Centered Self-Management of Chronic Conditions. The project (a) evaluates four culturally adapted, family-based treatments designed to improve health status, self-management behaviors and self-efficacy among Mexican-Americans with Type 2 diabetes using a Sequential, Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial in a public health setting, and (b) tests hypotheses about the applicability of Ryan and Sawin's Individual and Family Self-Management Theory, the conceptual foundation for the intervention's key constructs, to the study of diabetes self-management in this population. This conceptual model was selected for study because its emphasis on the integration of family members as partners in care while promoting illness self-management is highly germane to the study population and to the proposed intervention. Spanish speaking, Mexican-American patients with Type 2 diabetes and their families will be recruited from a primary care clinic affiliated with a large, urban public hospital located in a predominantly Mexican American area of Los Angeles. In the first phase of the study, subjects will be randomly assigned to six 2.5 hour sessions (three months) of either: 1) Tomando Control de su Diabetes (TC), a culturally tailored, community-based, Diabetes Self-Management program delivered in a group format by community health workers (promotoras) working with individual patients and families; or 2) TC delivered by health professionals (licensed nurses). Evaluations will be made at baseline, three months, six months and 12 months. After six weeks of treatment (at the midway point of the intervention), subjects will be assessed for improvement in diabetes self-management behaviors (the primary outcome). In the second phase of the study, those subjects who have improved their diabetes self-management behaviors by 50% over baseline will be continued in their assigned treatment for the duration of three months. Those subjects who do not meet this target will be re-randomized to receive either: 1) an augmented version of TC that has a specific focus on engaging family members; or 2) a multifamily group treatment led by nurses specially trained in teaching diabetes self-management skills for an additional three months. Subjects will be assessed on setting and adhering to self-management goals related to diabetes; self-management behaviors including adhering to the ADA diet, engaging in exercise activities, monitoring glucose levels and taking prescribed hypoglycemic medications; diabetes self-efficacy; and hemoglobin A1c levels. Family members will be assessed during these same time frames to determine their knowledge of diabetes care; levels of collaborative goal setting with their ill relative and the health care provider; and levels of family support. The results will advance the understanding of the factors that affect self-management for Mexican-Americans with Type 2 diabetes, and will provide valuable information towards constructing an adaptive intervention that will help to determine which treatment strategies work to improve diabetes self-management behaviors most efficiently and for whom."

"9301226","Summary Neisseria gonorrhoeae is the etiological agent of the sexually transmitted infection (STI) gonorrhea, a high morbidity disease worldwide with ~ 106 million cases annually. Like many human pathogens this organism must adapt to environments encountered during infection, including low pH and varying oxygen and iron levels. Tight control of gene expression in the gonococcus is mediated in part by the Fur protein, which binds to specific DNA sequences leading to either activation or repression of a repertoire of genes. We recently reported that the gonococcal Fur regulon extends to additional regulatory proteins, which together contribute to gonococcal mechanisms of pathogenesis. We also established that subsets of Fur regulated genes are expressed during natural gonococcal infection in women relative to during growth in vitro. Based collectively on our results we hypothesize that the gonococcal Fur regulon extends to additional regulatory networks that are expressed and regulated in the female genital tract. The studies proposed in this application will define how Fur-mediated regulation is extended through control of additional regulators that are crucial to natural infection. Our analysis will focus on regulatory proteins and sRNAs that are 1) Controlled via Fur (directly or indirectly) and 2) Regulated during natural infection in humans. We term these ?gonococcal regulators expressed in vivo? (GREIV). The following Aims are proposed: Aim 1. To define the repertoire of Fur-controlled gonococcal regulatory proteins and sRNAs expressed during natural infection of the female genital tract. Aim 2. To characterize the role of newly identified Fur-controlled GREIV in N. gonorrhoeae interactions with epithelial cells and innate immune cells. Aim 3. To fully define gonococcal global regulatory networks expressed during natural infection of the female genital."

"9329527","Rodent studies have demonstrated critical roles of regulatory T cells (Treg) in transplant tolerance, raising expectations that adoptive Treg therapy may eliminate the dependence of transplant patients on CNI-based immunosuppression (IS),- a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Recent use of alternative therapy, in particular the costimulation blocking (CoSB) agent belatacept, while improving long-term renal graft function, has led to increased rates of rejection. While T cell depletion (ATG) at the time of transplant reduces dependence on CNI, homeostatic T cell proliferation results in preferential expansion of memory T cells (Tmem),- a major barrier to tolerance induction. Combined T cell depletion plus belatacept can prevent rejection, but tolerance is not achieved. While clinical trials are underway to evaluate Treg in organ transplantation, their functional plasticity and potential conversion to pathogenic T cells raise valid concerns, Better understanding of the mechanisms that may alter Treg function after their infusion in graft recipients is essential for safe and effective implementation of Treg therapy. We have shown recently that early polyclonal Treg infusion into lymphodepleted NHP is associated with enhanced graft injury and Tmem recovery. IL-2 and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF?1) are critical for Treg development and low dose IL-2 selectively expands endogenous Treg in NHP and humans. Also, TGF?1 signaling is essential for prevention of inflammatory responses in lymphopenic hosts. In rodents, infusion of huTGF?1/Fc in combination with rapamycin enhances graft survival. In collaboration with the NIAID NHP Reagent Resource we have generated an agonistic TGF?1/Fc protein for use in NHP. Our preliminary data show that this TGF?1/Fc reduces rhesus T cell proliferation synergistically with rapamycin and promotes Treg in the presence of IL-2. Circulating TGF?1/Fc can be detected for several days after its infusion into lymphodepleted rhesus. Based on these findings, we propose to evaluate, the influence of donor alloractive- reactive Treg (arTreg) therapy in combination with IL-2 and TGF?1/Fc on renal graft survival in the rhesus model. All three Specific Aims will be accompanied by mechanistic and biomarker studies and be highly interactive with Project 1 and Cores A and B. Aim 1: To determine the influence of ex-vivo expanded autologous arTreg on renal allograft survival in rhesus macaques given ATG, belatacept and rapamycin (ABR) IS, and underlying mechanisms Aim 2: To assess whether low-dose IL-2 can enhance the suppressive function and numbers of ex- vivo expanded arTreg in graft recipients given ABR IS and further improve graft survival Aim 3: To evaluate the influence of co-administered TGF?1/Fc and IL-2 on the stability and suppressive function of ex-vivo expanded arTreg in graft recipients given ABR IS and promote operational tolerance"

"9357707","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Technological advances in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) allow for treatments to be implemented and continued for days, weeks, or even months depending on an infant's gestation and underlying condition. During this time, the infant may experience pain and other symptoms that are difficult for healthcare providers to assess and manage, and also for parents to comprehend, which may cause them emotional distress. Currently there is a significant gap in our understanding of the symptom experience of critically ill infants at high risk of dying in the NICU compared to other pediatric and adult populations. Closing these knowledge gaps is critical to improving evidence-based care for these infants and their families. The long-term goal is to improve the symptom assessment and thereby the care that critically ill infants and families receive in the NICU. The objective of this prospective, longitudinal study is to characterize infant symptom burden among 100 infants in the NICU from multiple sources and identify associations between parents' perceptions of the infant's symptom experience and their decision-making, coping, and distress. The central hypothesis is that proper assessment and management of infant symptoms and suffering will enhance parent decision-making, as well as reduce infant suffering and parent distress. The rationale is that identifying symptoms that are most distressing for infants, parents, and clinicians will inform the design and evaluation of future interventions to improve care. The study objective will be obtained by pursuing 3 specific aims: 1) to prospectively characterize the symptom experience of critically ill infants at high risk of dying in the NICU from multiple sources (i.e. parents, nurses, medical chart review, and behavioral observation) from admission until discharge/death (or a maximum of 3 months); 2) to identify links between parents' perceptions of infant symptom burden, suffering, and quality of life and the effects on treatment decision-making and goals of care over time; and 3) to identify links between parents' perceptions of infant symptom burden, suffering, and quality of life and parent coping and distress over time. This approach is innovative because it is the first prospective study, to evaluate the symptom experience of critically ill infants in the NICU and to explore how perceptions of their experience impact parent decision- making, coping, and distress. This research is significant because it will inform the design of novel prospective investigations and intervention development aimed at improving symptom assessment and outcomes among infants and their families in the NICU."
"9364697","SUMMARY  Cancer cells typically exhibit genetic instability and accumulate thousands to hundreds of thousands of mutations in their genome. Replicative DNA polymerases are responsible for copying the vast majority of nuclear DNA. Conditions that reduce their ability to accurately and efficiently synthesize daughter DNA molecules can contribute directly to this increased mutagenesis. Recently, heterozygous missense mutations were identified in the exonuclease domain of DNA Polymerase (Pol) ? from several tumor types. These tumors contain the highest number of somatic mutations identified in tumor genomes to date. Despite these significant consequences, the mechanisms that drive this mutagenesis and how this ultimately affects tumorigenesis remain poorly understood. Here we provide evidence that different cancer-associated mutations in human DNA polymerase (Pol) ?, a major replicative DNA polymerase, impair proofreading activity to dramatically different degrees. We further provide evidence that the degree of proofreading impairment corresponds to the level of cellular mutagenesis.  The main goal of this project is to test our central hypothesis that observed tumor ultramutator phenotypes result mainly from the suppression of intrinsic proofreading caused by cancer-derived mutations in Pol ? . This hypothesis is based on our preliminary data. Specifically, this project will 1) Establish a kinetic basis for cancer-causing Pol ? mutant alleles; 2) Define the mechanisms through which Pol ? exonuclease domain mutations (EDMs) generate their unique mutational signatures using novel gene-edited cell lines; and 3) Determine the mechanisms through which Pol ? variants contribute to tumor development.  The proposed research is innovative due to the multidisciplinary approach that combines in vitro studies with studies using novel engineered human cell lines and mouse models to characterize the effects of cancer- associated Pol ? mutations on genome stability, mutagenesis and tumorigenesis. The novel insights into how defects at the replication fork can influence genomic alterations are also innovative. This contribution is significant because it will provide new and detailed insights into the biochemical mechanisms of how replicative DNA polymerases normally prevent the acquisition of the complex diversity of mutations found in cancer genomes, as well as provide insights into the fundamental mechanisms of DNA replication. This knowledge will deepen our understanding of cancer development and can ultimately serve to inform future studies designed to modulate DNA polymerase activities toward the goal of novel cancer therapeutic strategies."

Key activities proposed include mentorship, peer learning, self-directed and online courses, specialized seminars and planned workshops including scientific writing, research methodology, biostatistics, writing for publication, research dissemination, grants management and ethics capacity training. The research will be carried out at various sites across the province particularly within decentralized sites some of which have been established as MEPI Learning Centers within the current UKZN-MEPI ENTRÉE Program like Bethesda and Murchison Hospitals. There will be two cohorts of ten trainees beginning a year apart. The first cohort will include ten junior faculty, as defined by UKZN; while the second cohort will include a minimum of five trainees from decentralized areas within the provincial health service while additional junior faculty and joint UKZN-DoH appointees will complete the intake. The duration of DRILL will be three to five years with each scientific area having five trainees. DRILL intends that the trainees become future leaders of innovative research which they will share with the rest of the African continent."
"9219386","PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent senile dementia affecting 4.5 million Americans. Neuroinflammatory changes are prominent and may significantly contribute to the pathologic process. Mononuclear phagocytes (brain resident microglia and recruited peripheral monocytes) accumulate around amyloid plaque in AD brains. However, their exact cellular identity, molecular and functional phenotypes, and their protective or destructive roles in AD are not well understood. This stems in part from the lack of a specific molecular signatures for mononuclear phagocytes, cell type-specific antibodies, and analytic tools for in situ characterization. We identified that a specific microRNA, miR-155, plays a key role in pro-inflammatory activation of microglia, whereas the TREM2/apolipoprotein E (APOE) axis plays a central role to suppress homeostatic M0 microglia. This may lead to impaired amyloid-? peptide clearance and acceleration of neurodegeneration. Thus, the balance between TREM2 and MERTK expression determines the microglial inflammatory response to apoptotic cells. Restoration of the homeostatic microglia by targeting the specific MERTK pathway represents a novel immunotherapeutic approach. Our preliminary data demonstrate that these novel molecular targets (miR-155, APOE, TREM2 and MERTK) are highly connected biological molecular regulators of microglial phenotypes and thus we will investigate each of these targets to determine their roles in AD. We hypothesize that danger signals (dead neurons and amyloid-? peptides) alter functional phenotype of innate immune cells from the homeostatic (M0) to newly discovered neurodegenerative (MGnD) phenotype. We will address our hypothesis in the following aims: Aim 1: Targeting Trem2-induced Apoe/miR155 pathway to restore M0-homeostatic microglia in AD mouse models. We will specifically delete miR-155, Apoe and Trem2 in microglia of AD mouse models. Aim 2: Restoration of M0-homeostatic microglia via Mertk pathway in humanized APOE4 and AD mice. We will specifically over-express Mertk in microglia of APOE4 humanized mice and AD mouse models. We will validate our findings by investigating AD brains from prodromal to advanced stages. The goal of our investigations is to define new molecular mechanisms of immune and inflammatory processes that contribute to the development and progression of AD, which in turn will provide a basis for new approaches for immune based therapy of the disease."
"9376623","PROJECT SUMMARY Measurement of cortisol is a reliable approach to diagnosing psychological stress, as well as chronic diseases related to cortisol disorders. The hormone cortisol is released in the body during stressed and agitated status and has a high correlation with post-traumatic stress disorders and other related psychological diseases. Salivary cortisol level is an excellent index of the unbound plasma free cortisol. Cortisol level typically fluctuates throughout the day, and diagnosis of cortisol-related diseases and assessment of psychological stress level cannot rely on a single measurement; mapping cortisol levels over time through is necessary to identify trends indicative of psychological stress onset or diagnosis of disease. Current cortisol measurement techniques are lab-based and episodic, and cannot be used for continuous monitoring. We propose to create a wearable, in- mouth sensor that supports ambulatory monitoring of salivary cortisol in real time. The device leverages a new biosensor architecture consisting of a bioresponsive hydrogel and embedded conductive nanowire networks. The proposed biosensor is expected to achieve a detection limit of 0.2 nM with a response time of less than 5 minutes, as required for real-time detection applications. The proposed strategy enables sensitive, specific, and reversible detection of neutrally-charged cortisol without the addition of chemical reporters or redox reagents for signal transduction. Such capability overcomes the limits encountered in charge-based transistor/nanowire biosensors or electrochemical techniques. Integration with a custom amperometric read-out integrated circuit (IC) will provide high-resolution, quantitative sensor measurement in a mm-scale microchip and the addition of a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) wireless transceiver will provide real-time data transmission to a smartphone for processing, archiving, and upload to the cloud."
"9325047","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The unifying theme of this P01 proposal is to investigate one of the cornerstones of female fertility, ovulation. Through this P01 project, we will address key questions of the mechanisms associated with follicular rupture and the subsequent early changes in the postovulatory follicle. This will be accomplished through the scientific integration, both experimentally and technically, of 4 separate projects involving 5 investigators that will utilize ovarian tissues from women, macaques, and rodents. Project 1 (Curry/Brannstrom) will make use of an extremely novel model where human follicles are collected across the periovulatory period to examine the changes in the expression of extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN). Project #2 (Duffy) will take advantage of Dr. Duffy's extensive experience with macaques to investigate the role of PGE2 in angiogenesis of the nonhuman primate periovulatory follicle. Project #3 (Ko) will study the mechanisms by which progesterone regulates leukocyte infiltration in the preovulatory ovary. Project #4 (Jo) will elucidate the cellular action of CIPAR1 in regulating the LH mediated induction of progesterone production. Translational interactions across the projects are readily evident as tissues from women (Project #1) and macaques (Project #2) will be available to extrapolate to rodent models (Projects 1, 3, 4). An Administrative core provides support for the research teams by overseeing the overall functioning of the program as well as coordinating shared tissues from women, macaques and rodents across the different projects. A pilot project will also be supported to open additional avenues of research collaboration and expertise. The significance of this proposal lies in its truly unique translational potential to further our understanding of the pathways that are critical for ovulation and early luteal formation in the human. There can be no stronger translational potential than to use human follicles collected at defined times after hCG to truly comprehend the mechanisms of ovulation and luteinization. The proposed studies in both the human and macaque will make significant strides towards advancing our understanding and treatment of ovulatory associated infertility as well as providing therapeutic modalities to manipulate the ovulatory process in the human thereby providing an important relevance to human health."
"9470933","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop and implement a Knowledge Base and Coordination Center for the Consortium of Cross Organ Mechanism-Associated Phenotypes for Genetic Analyses of Heart, Lung, Blood, and Sleep Diseases (MAPGen). Our team possesses strong expertise in bioinformatics, statistics, computer science, as well as clinical and biological expertise in heart, lung, and blood diseases. We propose three major functions of the center: (1) Develop a knowledge base on interconnections among diseases. We will systematically identify, integrate, and analyze the vast amount of public data (e.g. NCBI GEO, SRA, dbGap, and published papers) to comprehensively describe the shared molecular mechanisms among diseases. We will establish a multi-dimensional disease connectivity map that can be interactively accessed via web- interface. Using this knowledge base, we will design computational approaches to identify biomarkers that can be used to predict more than one disease, to regroup diseases based on the underlying molecular mechanisms, to design novel approaches to predict disease progression, and to identify novel drug usages. (2) Develop a bioinformatics infrastructure for the MAPGen consortium. We will be responsible for the quality control of the data generated by Consortium; we will perform integrative analysis of data generated by different RCs as well those from public domains, in order to gain deep insights and fundamental understandings of the shared molecular mechanisms among the HLBS diseases. We will use the knowledge base developed in Aim 1 to further establish the connections between the HLBS and other diseases. We will work closely with the medical co-investigators at USC as well as all RC teams to develop and validate biological hypotheses. (3) We will establish an Administrative Center to coordinate activities across RCs, including coordination of manuscript and other document preparation; coordination of the activities of all Committees; overall study coordination and quality control; and administering the distribution of additional funds in years 3 and 4. We aim to synergize the effort across all RCs to achieve the goal of understanding the genetic mechanisms responsible for the interconnections among cross-organ diseases. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The proposed projects will facilitate the identification and characterization of common pathobiologic traits and mechanisms cross organ systems, and provide a basis for the rational, mechanism-based development of new diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic strategies for heart, lung, blood and sleep disorders.

"9376450","Project Summary. Depression has been described as a problem of impaired neuroplasticity (e.g., prefrontal synaptic depression) at the molecular level, and decreased cognitive flexibility and prefrontal cortex (PFC) control at the neurocognitive level. Intravenous ketamine, which displays rapid antidepressant properties, is posited to reverse depression by rapidly enhancing molecular neuroplasticity; but surprisingly little is known regarding its effects on depressed patients' neurocognitive processing. We posit that ketamine will rapidly increase cognitive flexibility and the PFC's influence on affective regions, allowing for rigid, negative biases in cognition to be rapidly reversed. We further expect these neurocognitive changes will provide a clinical window of opportunity in which to introduce automated cognitive training techniques, which will consolidate adaptive forms of cognitive processing (specifically, positive implicit representations of self) while neuroplasticity remains high. Instantiating adaptive forms of processing after first `priming' the brain with ketamine represents a potentially synergistic treatment approach that could extend the acute effects of a single ketamine infusion beyond its typical 3-7 day window, efficiently fostering antidepressant effects that are both rapid and enduring. In this study, 150 patients exhibiting a target profile (self-reported impairments in cognitive flexibility; negative self- representations; and clinically elevated depression symptoms) will be randomized to receive a single infusion of ketamine or a psychoactive control (midazolam) and will complete measures designed to capture a proposed neurocognitive `signature of rapid relief.' This approach will extend molecular models of ketamine's antidepressant mechanisms to novel cognitive domains, revealing the neurocognitive state that tracks with rapid relief. We hypothesize to see increases in cognitive flexibility and directed connectivity from PFC to salience network regions, and corresponding decreases in one of the rigid, negative biases posited to be a key cognitive promoter of depression: negative representations of self (?depressive self-schemas?)?a cognitive pattern that has shown preliminary sensitivity to ketamine's rapid influence in our previous studies. In a fully factorial (2x2) design, patients will then be randomized to receive a brief computer-based cognitive training protocol during the post-infusion ?window of opportunity,? designed to implicitly reverse negative self- representations, instilling positive self-representations in their place, or a sham variant of the same training. Patients will be followed over 1 month acutely (with 6-month naturalistic follow-up) to assess whether active cognitive training enhances and/or extends the durability of ketamine's effects on depression and on the neurocognitive `signature of rapid relief.' After priming brain plasticity with ketamine, we expect that training positive self-representations will provide an exceedingly efficient, low-cost, portable, non-invasive, safe, and highly dissemination-ready strategy for extending ketamine's rapid antidepressant effects. This study will provide novel, integrative information on neurocognitive intermediaries bridging ketamine's molecular and mood effects, and will represent the first attempt to synergistically combine ketamine with a cognitive training intervention in order to exploit and extend ketamine's rapid effects."
"9336885","Abstract A major obstacle to the development of protective therapies for polycystic kidney disease (PKD) has been our limited understanding of the cellular pathways that are altered when the PKD1 (polycystin-1 or PC1), PKD2 (polycystin-2 or PC2) or PKHD1 (polyductin or PD1) genes (collectively referred to as PKD genes/proteins) are mutated. In general, researchers have identified critical cellular pathways in cell culture systems and in animal models, and then sought druggable components of these pathways with the goal of developing therapeutic agents that would slow disease progression. This paradigm requires a basic tool kit of validated PKD reagents that includes antibodies, DNA constructs and cell lines. Although some tools are available at a few centers in the US, investigators frequently have limited access to them. There is an unmet need in the PKD Research Community for validated and readily available PKD reagents. In addition, many investigators who are new to the field may not have the experience to leverage these tools for in-depth analysis of PKD proteins. The main objective of Core B is to meet these needs by providing a comprehensive set of validated PKD reagents along with technical assistance. This takes advantage of expertise that we have established over the past two decades and a reagent repository that we have significantly expanded during the last funding period. Core B is comprised of two highly integrated components. The ?antibody validation? component will provide validated PC1 and PD1 antibodies coupled with expert advice on how to use the reagents. Furthermore, we will develop novel PC1 and PD1 antibodies that have the highest specificity against native protein using a novel strategy (folded domain antigens). The ?vectorology? component will allow investigators immediate access to an extensive collection of plasmid expression vectors for wild type and mutant PKD proteins and CRISPR PKD genome-editing vectors, and offer custom PKD expression vectors with newly developed tags and/or engineered mutations. We will also provide isogenic MDCK and IMCD cell lines that express these proteins in a stable and inducible fashion. The Core will also assist our research base with utilization of our reagents. The Specific Aims are: Aim 1: To provide a panel of validated PC1 antibodies that can detect endogenous proteins. Aim 2: To provide a panel of validated PD1 antibodies that can detect endogenous proteins. Aim 3: To provide PKD expression vectors and CRISPR genome-editing vectors. Aim 4: To provide renal cell models with stable and inducible expression of PKD proteins, and with PKD gene knockouts. Aim 5: To provide a training workshop in PKD protein biochemistry. In summary, the mission of Core B is to effectively remove technical barriers to PKD research in order to promote discoveries that will facilitate the development of protective therapies for PKD.  "
"9328009","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Project 1 Phenotypic plasticity can endow isogenic cell populations with multiple co-existing phenotypes. In the context of cancer, two phenotypes that can be of particular consequence to progression of aggressive cancers are `high proliferation-low migration' (?Proliferative? or P-phenotype) and `low proliferation-high migration' (Aggressive or A-phenotype). The so-called `grow or go' model suggests that cells can switch between these relatively stable phenotypic states, with the rates of transition being functions of the genetic and environmental changes. The increasing rate of switching from proliferative to migratory phenotypic states (the P-A switch) can signal progression to the more invasive (and ultimately metastatic) cancer progression. Currently, the signaling and regulatory networks underlying the P-A switch are poorly understood. In this project, we propose to investigate this switch in high quantitative detail using a novel approach allowing us to separate the two phenotypes based on competitive migration of cells in which genes can be silenced on the kinome- or genome- wide scale. This RACE assay will be performed with primary cells and cell lines of particularly invasive cancer types: glioblastoma multiforme and high grade melanoma. Our preliminary data suggest that the silencing of expression of a wide range of kinases can either enhance or suppress melanoma cell migration. Furthermore, faster, more aggressive cells were found to have differential enrichment of a variety of signaling pathways vs. the proliferative, slower cells. The combined analysis of the signaling and genetic perturbations suggested that the aggressive phenotype is a complex state that not only has different proliferation and migration characteristics, but also has different differentiation and metabolic states, in agreement with previous clinical observations. In addition to the expected molecular players, we identified novel potential regulators, and developed a novel, synthetic biology-based method to identify chemical compounds that can target these regulators. These and other findings led us to propose a program of research aimed at delineation, mathematical and computational modeling, and validation of the networks underlying cell-autonomous (i.e., assuming no cell-cell communication) P-A switching. We further hypothesized that the dynamics of the P-A switching can be influenced by the frequency of fluctuations of environmental factors that can suppress the proliferative phenotype, including drugs commonly used in the clinic. The model accounting for the population dynamics underlying this switching behavior will be trained using both cancer cells and, as a model, synthetically modified yeast cells. We anticipate that this project will lead to an increased understanding of invasive tumor spread estimated to account to more than 90% of deaths in human cancers. This project will be complemented by the second project focused on cell-non-autonomous mechanisms promoting or inhibiting cancer cell invasion."
"9346877","ABSTRACT Cigarette smoking is disproportionately prevalent among persons with HIV as compared to the general population. Currently, smoking is responsible for a greater loss of life years than is HIV itself in this population. Many HIV-positive smokers report a desire to quit but are unable to do so. Poor cessation rates in this population are likely due in part to suboptimal adherence to smoking cessation medications. Mobile technologies, like smartphones, are increasingly ubiquitous and affordable in the U.S., and can be integrated to augment medication adherence. Mobile phone-delivered interventions show promise at improving cessation outcomes relative to usual care in smokers living with HIV. However, the only existing trial to attempt to improve adherence to smoking cessation medication among smokers living with HIV has yielded null results. It is possible that smokers living with HIV may require an additional behavioral component to improve the effectiveness of mobile-phone-based interventions. Thus, we propose to evaluate mSMART, an existing smartphone application that targets medication adherence, in combination with contingency management (CM)?a behavioral intervention shown to improve outcomes for clinically relevant behaviors such as HIV medication adherence and smoking cessation?to improve adherence to varenicline among smokers with HIV. The overarching goal of the research proposed in this application is to develop and evaluate an intervention that targets adherence to varenicline, with the goal of improving adherence and cessation outcomes among smokers living with HIV. The proposed research study has the following specific aims: 1) To conduct formative interviews with smokers living with HIV; 2) To conduct a proof-of-concept trial of mSMART and mSMART+CM; and 3) To characterize determinants of varenicline adherence. The proposed research builds upon the Principal Investigator's previous experience and is closely aligned with her overarching career development goal of becoming an independent investigator with expertise in the development and evaluation of treatments for smoking cessation among smokers living with HIV. Dr. Pacek is a postdoctoral associate at the Duke University Medical Center with expertise in the epidemiology of smoking in persons living with HIV and behavioral pharmacology of smoking. The primary training goals of this proposal are to gain skills in clinical trials research methodology and mobile health intervention development, and develop content expertise in medication adherence. The results of the proposed research and training plans will facilitate Dr. Pacek's development as an independent investigator and provide preliminary data for a future large-scale efficacy study."
"9241722","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This Integrative Neuroscience Initiative on Alcoholism (INIA-Neuroimmune [INIA-N]) consortium application is for a U24 Research Resource that will act as a service core to provide electrophysiological evaluation of targets identified or developed by INIA-N investigators. The guiding hypothesis of INIA-N is that genetic differences and neuroadaptations in immune-related pathways contribute to the vulnerability to excessive alcohol consumption. In addition to validating neuroimmune signaling pathways already identified during the prior funding period, this consortium will use genomic datasets and computational approaches to predict novel compounds that may be efficacious in reducing excessive alcohol consumption. This core resource will provide essential services to INIA-N investigators by performing studies that examine the cellular electrophysiological functions of brain immune signaling systems and their causal or therapeutic role(s) in excessive alcohol consumption. These studies will be divided among three major subgroups of INIA-N target identification and investigation. In Specific Aim 1, novel INIA-N compounds that are efficacious in reducing excessive alcohol consumption will be evaluated. In Specific Aim 2, the focus will be on genetic targets, of which the majority will be long non-coding RNAs shown to influence drinking. Specific Aim 3 will focus on studies in animal models of hereditary excessive drinking. Electrophysiological experiments, designed in collaboration with the relevant INIA-N investigators, will use new technologies to study neural circuits involved in excessive drinking, and, in cases of wholly novel targets, will employ an unbiased approach of measuring basic membrane properties along with excitatory and/or inhibitory synaptic transmission to screen for mechanisms of action in mesolimbic brain structures. The results of these studies will provide basic information on the role of brain neuroimmune systems in excessive ethanol consumption and help prioritize novel targets for further development."

"9307866","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal focuses on the development and optimization of three complementary technologies that will improve our ability to efficiently characterize sequence variants uncovered in ongoing re-sequencing efforts of patients with both single gene and complex disorders. While the technologies are widely applicable to human disease studies and associated variants, our proof-of-principle analysis will focus on the analysis of putative regulatory variants located in non-coding regions of the genome. Specifically, we will analyze sequence variants that are associated with changes in expression of individual adjacent genes (cis-expression quantitative trait loci, cis-eQTL) and with lipid-related traits in families of the San Antonio Family Heart Study (SAFHS). It is clear that the identification and characterization of functional regulatory sequence variants affecting gene expression related to human diseases requires the development and application of novel analysis tools that allow the characterization of protein binding both in vitro and in vivo. We propose to use the resources of the SAFHS which include complete whole genome sequence (WGS) data, eQTL information and disease association, and cell lines available from all participants, to develop three independent complementary technologies for the functional characterization of regulatory variants influencing lipid variation: In vitro Technology: We will develop high-throughput dsDNA arrays for in vitro analysis of allele-specific protein-DNA interactions, and evaluate 1000 variants associated with plasma lipid traits and individual gene expression levels (cis-eQTL) with p<5x10-7 in the SAFHS cohort. Representative variants will be validated by EMSA, and binding proteins will be identified using mass spectrometry. In silico Technology: We will apply Bayesian analysis approaches incorporating empirically derived (i.e., cis- acting effect sizes, lipid-associated effect sizes, allele frequency, etc.) and bioinformaticaly derived (i.e., regulatory potential, nucleosome accessibility, etc.) features to develop computational prediction tools to statistically predict likely functional regulatory variants from WGS data. In vivo Technology: We will develop an analysis approach to validate allele-specific protein binding to regulatory variants directly in cells. We will use cell lines from the SAFHS cohort of known genotype for putative functional variants influencing gene expression to isolate target regions of cross linked chromatin using hybridization capture, and confirm allele-specific protein binding. In addition to the development of this novel in vitro, in silico, and in vivo technologies that can be utilized to characterize both common and rare variation in the human genome, our proposed work will identify and validate regulatory variants associated with lipid traits in humans. This will provide a unique resource for GWAS and other studies dissecting the genetic basis of human diseases."
"9316709","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), the most common cardiomyopathy form, can result from mutations in contractile proteins (e.g. myosin). However, the structural, molecular, and physiological origins leading to cardiac dilation in myosin-based DCM are not well understood. We will take advantage of the powerful genetic tools available in Drosophila to generate the first fly models of myosin-based DCM and determine the mechanistic basis of disease. Multidisciplinary approaches will be implemented to determine how single amino acid changes in myosin disrupt intramolecular interactions and cause biochemical, structural and physiological defects in striated muscles. In Aim 1, we will generate the first X-ra crystal structures for myosin harboring mutations known to cause DCM in humans and predicted to modulate actin binding. Mutant His-tagged myosin will be expressed in indirect flight muscles (IFMs), purified, and use for crystallography. We will test the hypothesis that: DCM mutations in myosin that disrupt intramolecular interactions near or within the actin- binding site re-orient key residues important for actin binding. Aim 2 will implement a variety of approaches to better understand the biochemical, cell biological, and functional defects associated with human myosin DCM mutations. We will express and purify mutant myosin from IFMs for biochemical/biophysical assays (actin co- sedimentation, ATPase, in vitro motility) to determine the molecular basis of DCM due to myosin mutations. Ultrastructural analyses of IFMs will provide insight into the defects in myofibrillar assembly and maintenance induced by the mutations. Furthermore, we will determine if expression of such mutations cause skeletal muscle dysfunction using flight and jump tests. We will test the hypothesis that: mutations in myosin can weaken actin affinity, reduce enzymatic activity of myosin, and cause structural and functional defects in indirect flight muscles. In Aim 3, we will assess remodeling events that occur in the Drosophila heart due to expression of myosin DCM mutations. Although it is known that the Drosophila heart can remodel into a dilated phenotype, it is unknown if it dilates in response to myosin mutations known to cause DCM in humans. We will perform cardiac physiological and ultrastructural analyses of micro-dissected heart preparations to test the hypothesis that: expression of DCM-associated myosin mutations causes defects in cardiac contractility and leads to pathological remodeling akin to the human condition, i.e. cardiac dilation, arrhythmias, and ultrastructural defects. Overall, our project will provide detailed and comprehensive analyses to better understand how myosin dysfunction causes DCM and to determine the feasibility of using Drosophila as an assessment tool for human DCM. These studies will offer outstanding training in structural biology, biochemistry, and cell and molecular biology aimed at studying protein dysfunction related to heart disease to prepare the applicant for a related career in academia."
"9322216","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep or poor quality sleep (insomnia) is common in people with chronic ob- structive pulmonary disease. Insomnia is related to greater mortality, with four times the risk of mortality for sleep times < 300 minutes. Insomnia is also related to greater morbidity, with 75% greater health care costs than people without insomnia. However, insomnia medications are used with caution in COPD due to potential adverse effects. Common features of COPD such as dyspnea, chronic inflammation, anxiety and depression also affect insomnia and can interfere with therapy outcomes. While cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), a therapy that provides guidance on changing unhelpful sleep-related beliefs and behavior, is effective for people with primary insomnia and people with other chronic illnesses, the efficacy and mechanisms of ac- tion of such a therapy are yet unclear in people with COPD. Lack of such knowledge is an important problem, because without it, health care providers will remain ill-equipped to manage patients with both COPD and in- somnia. The long-term goal is to help develop safe and effective non-pharmacological interventions to mini- mize insomnia and its consequences in people with COPD. The objective here is to rigorously test efficacy of two components of insomnia therapy - CBT-I and COPD education (COPD-ED) - in people with coexisting in- somnia and COPD, and to identify mechanisms responsible for therapy outcomes. The central hypothesis is that both CBT-I and COPD-ED will have positive, lasting effects on insomnia and fatigue. This hypothesis is consistent with preliminary data produced by the applicant. The rationale for the proposed study is that once the efficacy and mechanisms of CBT-I and COPD-ED are known, new and innovative approaches for insomnia can be developed to nonpharmacologically minimize insomnia and fatigue, thereby leading to longer, higher quality and more productive lives for people with COPD, and reduced societal cost due to insomnia. Guided by strong preliminary data, the central hypothesis will be tested using a randomized controlled parallel-groups comparison of CBT-I, COPD-ED and non-COPD, non-sleep health education attention control (AC) using a highly efficient 4-group design. Arm 1 comprises 6 weekly sessions of CBT-I+AC; Arm 2=6 sessions of COPD- ED+AC; Arm 3=CBT-I+COPD-ED; and Arm 4=AC. This design will allow completion of the following Specific Aims: 1. Determine the efficacy of individual treatment components, CBT-I and COPD-ED, on insomnia and fatigue. 2. Define mechanistic contributors to the outcomes after CBT-I and COPD-ED. The proposed re- search is a significant, necessary step in the development of effective non-pharmacologic therapies for insom- nia coexisting with COPD. The work proposed in Aims 1 and 2 will provide systematic evidence of efficacy and mechanisms of components of a novel approach to insomnia coexisting with COPD. Results are expected to have great public health significance and positive impact because the identified mechanisms are highly likely to provide new approaches for preventive and therapeutic interventions for insomnia and fatigue in COPD."

Our current knowledge indicates that cells from the notochord, which are of embryonic origin, initiate the differentiation of mesenchymal progenitors into disc forming cells during the development of the spine as well as in early childhood. However, notochordal cells cannot be derived from adult stem cells. Therefore, we believe that embryonic progenitors are necessary to successfully derive disc-forming cells. Specifically, we propose to derive cellular components of the inner compartment of the intervertebral disc (nucleus pulposus) from human embryonic stem cells (H9 line) by generating mesenchymal-like stem cells and notochordal cells. Multiple ratios of these progenitors will be tested to form disc tissue components in vitro (Aim 1). The optimal ratio of hESC-derived notochordal and mesenchymal progenitor cells will be tested in a pre-clinical model of disc injury. Somatic cells will also be used as controls for the healing process (Aim 2). If successful, this high-risk proposal bears a strong potential to develop new and effective cell/matrix-based therapeutic strategies for the regeneration of human intervertebral discs."
"9419526","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Defining molecular mechanisms that ensure proper patterns of cell: cell connectivity in the developing nervous system has relied in part on genetic studies in vertebrate and invertebrate models, and in part on mapping loci responsible for heritable forms of brain dysfunction in humans. These efforts have identified several RNA binding proteins, whose individual loss alters neuronal morphology and connectivity, suggesting that post- transcriptional mechanisms play an important role in neurodevelopment.  We co-discovered a form of heritable intellectual disability caused by mutations in the gene encoding a polyadenosine RNA binding protein termed ZC3H14. Our analysis of a D. melanogaster model of this disease created by deletion of the sole invertebrate ZC3H14 homolog, dNab2, has revealed cell-autonomous defects in neuronal projection in the mushroom bodies (MBs), twin neuropil structures in the brain involved in learning and memory. Axons from wildtype MB neurons project towards the midline of the adult brain, while those from dNab2-deficient MB neurons misproject through the midline and into the contralateral brain hemisphere. Given the shared molecular role of dNab2/ZC3H14 as RNA binding proteins, we hypothesize that the axon misprojection and cognitive defects resulting from loss of functional dNab2/ZC3H14 are the result of defects in post-transcriptional control of target RNAs. Our published finding that human ZC3H14 partially compensates for dNab2 loss when expressed in fly neurons indicates that at least some of these RNA targets are shared.   This proposal focuses on identification of dNab2-bound RNAs from fly brain neurons that encode factors involved in axononogenesis. In Aim 1 we propose to use a validated approach, RNA Tagging, to specifically recover dNab2-bound RNAs from Drosophila neurons in their natural context in situ. A pilot application of this technique has already yielded two RNAs encoding protein with established roles in neuronal development. Aim 2 will pursue the hypothesis that dNab2 loss alters a key aspect of the post-transcriptional regulation of these dNab2-bound mRNAs, with ultimate effects on expression of their cognate proteins. Aim 3 completes the cycle by applying genetic tools to assess the in vivo role of each of these factors to wt brain development and their roles in dNab2 null phenotypes in the developing mushroom bodies.  These Aims leverage the strength of our Drosophila dNab2 model to support our long-term goal of defining the mechanistic basis of ZC3H14-associated neuronal defects in vertebrates. Our approach does not discount roles for dNab2 in other neuronal processes or cell types, but rather allows us to focus on one novel function of dNab2 (axonogenesis) in an experimentally accessible group of neurons (MB cells). Insights into molecular roles for dNab2 in MB neurons could be relevant to molecular defects in the neurons of human patients lacking ZC3H14."

"9334925","Description (provided by applicant): Airway smooth muscle (ASM) represents an attractive therapeutic target in severe asthma. Current bronchodilator medications are remarkably ineffective in severe asthma, probably because they activate a long and complex relaxant signaling pathway, whose multiple steps are vulnerable to antagonism by inflammation- activated pathways that confound relaxant signaling. Instead, a more robust strategy to disrupt ASM contraction is to target the contractile apparatus directly. To this end, we identified small molecules that inhibit smooth muscle myosin polymerization, relax human airway myocytes, and blunt bronchoconstriction in mouse lung slices and from these selected a lead compound. We now propose a comprehensive program in which the lead compound is chemically optimized for efficacy, potency, selectivity, safety, and desirable pharmacological and pharmaceutical properties when administered by inhalation. This program will culminate in the development of a new candidate medicine whose preclinical properties demonstrate its suitability for testing in human asthmatics. An IND application will be submitted to enable such testing. If successful, this project will result in the complete preclinical development of a new class of asthma medication (smooth muscle myosin polymerization inhibitor) with an entirely novel mechanism of action (literally dissolving the contractile apparatus) directed at a novel molecular target (smooth muscle myosin filaments). Because they dissolve myosin filaments, we call the new class of medication myosolvins.        (End of Abstract)"
"9307273","SUMMARY Lysosomal dysfunction has been increasingly implicated in the development of neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease (PD). Mutations in GBA1 encoding ?-glucocerebrosidase (GCase) cause Gaucher disease (GD), the most prevalent lysosomal storage disorder and represent an important genetic risk factor for synucleinopathies including PD and dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). A significant reduction in GCase activity has been also reported in brains of sporadic PD patients, suggesting that reduced GCase activity may represent a common feature of PD pathogenesis. Genetic linkage with PD and DLB has been also demonstrated for lysosomal membrane protein LIMP-2, the lysosomal trafficking receptor for GCase and GD modifier. Mutations in SCARB2 encoding LIMP-2 itself are disease-causing for a rare form of progressive myoclonic epilepsy associated with renal failure (AMRF). Our previous data showed that loss of function of LIMP-2 results in mistrafficking and lysosomal depletion of GCase and is also associated with a PD-like pathology in mice. We have also demonstrated that by elevating the levels of LIMP-2, lysosomal GCase activity was enhanced and ?-syn levels reduced, suggesting that both proteins are functionally linked in the regulation of lysosomal function and ?-syn metabolism. Therefore, we hypothesize that it will be critically important to consider LIMP-2-GCase interaction in the development of activators of GCase as potential therapeutics for PD and related synucleinopathies. To test this hypothesis, we propose to further examine the contribution of LIMP-2 in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies by providing molecular insights into the formation and trafficking of the LIMP-2/GCase complex, and its role in normal and diseased human neurons. Aim 1 will examine the assembly and stoichiometry of the wild type LIMP-2/GCase complex in live cells by using photoactivatable amino acids, pulse chase and immunoprecipitations experiments. These studies will be extended to GCase and LIMP-2 patient-linked mutations to determine their impact on the formation of the LIMP-2/GCase complex. Aim 2 will examine time-dependent phenotypes in LIMP-2- and GCase-deficient human midbrain neurons. We will generate iPSC-derived midbrain neurons from LIMP-2 patient fibroblasts to examine subcellular localization of GCase and GCase/LIMP-2 complex, lysosomal proteolysis and morphology, accumulation of lipid substrates and ?-synuclein in a time-dependent manner. In Aim 3 we will perform neuropathological characterization of a mouse model expressing LIMP-2 that is deficient in binding to GCase. To directly examine if the neurological phenotypes we previously described in LIMP-2 knockout mice result from depletion of lysosomal GCase, we generated a mouse model expressing LIMP-2-Y163D mutant that cannot bind GCase. These mice will be analyzed for ?-syn and lipid accumulation, lysosomal dysfunction, inflammation and neurotoxicity. These experiments will also establish whether the neuropathology mediated by LIMP-2 deficiency may be at least in part independent of GCase."
"9386370","The goals of the proposed K24 renewal are to continue to devote time to dedicated mentorship of new clinical investigators, engage in career development to enhance my own mentoring skills, and facilitate transition to independence for future POR leaders. These goals will be accomplished through sustained reduction in Dr. Christie's clinical and administrative responsibilities with a resultant increase in effort spent directly on mentoring activities, expanding Dr. Christie's research program to include further investigation of the donor lungs, and acquisition of new research and mentoring skills. Dr. Christie's successful research program investigating acute lung injury following lung transplantation (termed primary graft dysfunction, PGD) will be expanded to provide trainees with an intensive research experience complemented by career development activities including didactic coursework in degree programs, research seminars, grant writing workshops, and training in responsible conduct of research. The proposed renewal of the K24 research will address the hypotheses that donor smoke exposure is associated with epithelial injury and innate immune activation that begins in the donor in situ, and that PGD can be predicted using molecular markers of innate immunity, epithelial injury, and donor smoke exposure pre-operatively in donors. PGD is severe acute lung injury occurring in the days after lung transplantation and has a major impact on early morbidity, mortality, and cost. Evidence suggests that PGD is the end result of a series of injuries occurring in the donor lung from the time of brain death to reperfusion in the recipient. Therefore, potential donor organs are routinely discarded because of concern for PGD; further limiting the number of organs available for transplant. Under Aim 1, we will determine the association of donor smoke exposure with circulating markers of epithelial injury and innate immune activation in the donor prior to procurement, and with PGD post-operatively. Under Aim 2, we will determine and validate the predictive utility of circulating protein biomarkers of epithelial injury, innate immune activation, and donor smoke exposure for PGD when measured pre-operatively in donors. Fulfillment of our aims will enable prediction of PGD based on novel pre-operative donor markers of injury and immunity, provide new knowledge on the roles of donor innate immune activation and epithelial injury in PGD risk, develop an expanded research platform including more detailed donor characterization to benefit mentees interested in lung transplantation as well as in other forms of lung injury, and enhanced training for Dr. Christie in novel methods of prediction and endotype determination, as well as expanded training in mentoring."
"9319621","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diagnosis of infection is typically based on direct detection of the pathogen and/or its products in bodily fluids and tissues. This approach has limited sensitivity and speed of detection. We propose to develop a novel, host-based diagnostic assay platform for blood-based assays combining: (1) the precision of antigen-specific immune responses, (2) the versatility and robustness of nucleic acid detection by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and (3) the diagnostic and prognostic power of single-cell analysis by flow cytometry. Our preliminary work shows that stimulation of peripheral blood T lymphocytes ex vivo induces expression of mRNA for key cytokines (IL-2, IFN-? and TNF-?) that is detected by hybridization with gene-specific FISH probes and single- and multi-parameter flow cytometry. We now propose to move this platform through preclinical product development for diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) in partnership with Oxford Immunotec, a world leader in FDA-approved, host-based TB diagnostics. TB is the selected pathology because: (i) it is a global health problem; (ii) M. tuberculosis infection is diagnosed by detecting antigen- specific T cell responses; and (iii) i has a complex clinical presentation ranging from asymptomatic, latent infection (LTBI) to active pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). Application of our FISH-Flow platform to TB diagnosis is expected to yield a test with superior diagnostic accuracy and speed than the existing tests. Moreover, the platform has the unparalleled potential to distinguish between LTBI and PTB through its multi-parameter capacity, since stages/progression of infection are associated with different cytokine profiles. We will optimize key assay parameters and verify the resulting standardized assay for protocol robustness and reproducibility, assay duration, and initial assessment of diagnostic accuracy in comparison with an existing FDA-approved test. Future kit manufacturability will also be explored. The first outcome will be a simple and accurate single- cytokine assay for LTBI diagnosis that equals or exceeds the clinical accuracy of the existing LTBI diagnostics and surpasses them in speed and ease of execution. The second outcome will be the evaluation of the three- cytokine readout for distinguishing LTBI from PTB. Established collaborations at the PI site and at Oxford Immunotec with clinical sites in regions with low and high TB prevalence will provide blood samples from donors in all TB diagnostic groups. We have also shown that the FISH-Flow protocol is amenable to adaption to microfluidics-based, automated platforms. A third outcome will be automation of all assay steps upstream of flow-cytometry detection (from sample preparation to nuclei acid staining) to obtain a semi-automated device operating with standard flow cytometry. This work, conducted by our bioengineer partner who is experienced in commercializing diagnostic devices, should eventually lead to a hand-held, fully automated device with sample-in-answer-out capability. The FISH-Flow platform in its manual and automated versions will be applicable to detection of receptor-mediated responses in many infectious and non-infectious pathologies."
"9479534","Alcohol and tobacco use disorders are serious public health problems, but only a small number of medications are approved for treatment of either disorder. There is a pressing need to identify new neurotransmitter targets for medication development. There is clear preclinical and emerging clinical evidence that the glutamate (Glu) system plays a central role in development and maintenance of regular alcohol and nicotine use, withdrawal and reinstatement after a period of abstinence. Pre- clinical studies have demonstrated a specific role for the metabotropic glutamate receptor, type 5 (mGluR5). This study will examine the mGluR5 receptor in persons with alcohol use disorder (AUD) compared with age-matched healthy controls (HC) and persons with tobacco use disorder (TUD); it also will clarify the effects of smoking and TUD in the AUD population. Positron emission tomography (PET), using the specific mGluR5 radioligand [18F]FPEB, will quantify mGluR5 binding potential (BPND), a PET-derived measure that relates to receptor availability and density. Specifically, aim 1 will compare mGluR5 BPND in non-treatment seeking AUD (N=80) versus HC participants (N=40). Additionally, among AUD subjects, smokers (AUD+TUD; N=40) will be compared with nonsmokers (AUD only; N=40) (aim 2), and TUD only participants (N=40) will be compared with AUD+TUD (N=40) and HC participants (N=40) (aim 3). All participants will complete standardized assessment procedures to characterize alcohol and tobacco use history. Eligible AUD participants will be admitted to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) and complete a three day, unmedicated alcohol detoxification; smokers will maintain their usual quantity/frequency of cigarette use; measures of alcohol withdrawal and craving as well as mood will be obtained. On day 4, AUD subjects complete PET measurement of mGluR5 BPND. On day 5, AUD subjects participate in an alcohol-motivated progressive ratio procedure to quantify extent of responding for and consumption of alcohol. In addition to the between-group comparisons, we will examine relationships between [18F]FPEB BPND and CRU measures of alcohol withdrawal and craving (aim 4), amount of alcohol-motivated responding (aim 5), as well as baseline assessment measures of amount and frequency of alcohol and tobacco use (aim 6). To date, therapeutic benefit of clinically approved or investigational AUD medications has been modest. However, there are multiple lines of evidence indicating that the mGluR5 site is highly sensitive in animal models, and shows promise as a target for treatment. This proposal will be the first to characterize mGluR5 in living humans with AUD, to clarify the modulating role of tobacco use in this population and to examine the relationship of mGluR5 to key behavioral measures of alcohol and tobacco use. Importantly, mGluR5 negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) are in development by several drug companies and are undergoing clinical trials for several psychiatric diseases. This proposed study will set the stage for future research to directly test the therapeutic effects of mGluR5 NAMs on brain mGluR5 occupancy and behavioral outcomes in AUD clinical population."
"9382863","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Arsenic is a naturally occurring toxic metalloid element to which prolonged exposure in humans is associated with keratosis, hyperpigmentation, lung and cardiovascular disease, and multiple forms of cancer. Chronically exposed individuals show high variability in symptoms, even among similarly exposed individuals. Host specific factors like genetic variability, body weight, and diet only partially account for this observed variability. In ecosystems where it occurs naturally, arsenic can exist in a variety of organic and inorganic chemical compounds of varying degrees of toxicity. In these environments, biochemical transformations of arsenic are primarily driven by microbial processes. Some microbes also have the ability to incorporate arsenic into their cellular biomass.  The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbiome of mammals confers numerous important functional benefits to the host organism, many of which are not well understood or characterized. It has also been shown that altering gut microbial communities of mice can change the profile of arsenic transformations that take place in these communities. Preliminary research suggests that the GIT microbiome functions to protect the murine host from ingested arsenic. We have demonstrated that germ-free mice and mice with antibiotic-disrupted GIT microbiomes accumulate more arsenic in host tissues when compared with similarly exposed mice with conventional microbiomes. When the primary host system for detoxifying systemic arsenic is inactivated, mortality is observed in germ-free and antibiotic treated mice, even at low levels of arsenic exposure.  The proposed research aims to investigate the function of the human microbiome in arsenic toxicity by leveraging the use of germ-free mice, which can be colonized with the GIT microbiome from a human donor. This research will investigate not only the influence of the human microbiome on host arsenic exposure, but also the mechanisms by which it influences. Arsenic transformations will be measured in germ-free and humanized mice while tracking host health to determine the health impacts of specific transformations in vivo. In order to determine if specific microbial groups increase or decrease the host's exposure to toxic arsenicals, the microbiome of humanized mice will be manipulated while monitoring arsenic transformations and host health. This research will elucidate new functions of the human microbiome relating to arsenic toxicity. There is potential for this project to have immediate impacts on human health interventions."

This two- stage, mixed-methods study will examine the epidemiology of IDU, its infectious consequences, and service accessibility among young persons who inject drugs (PWID) (UG3 phase) in 15 rural counties in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont, and then implement an integrated telemedicine approach to treat OUD and reduce HIV, HCV, STIs, major bacterial infections (e.g. infective endocarditis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, epidural abscess) and overdose (UH3 phase). The UG3 phase will employ qualitative, quantitative, social network, geospatial, and laboratory methods to characterize the risk environment and epidemiology of OUD, its infectious complications, opioid overdose, risk behaviors, service use and needs in a respondent-driven sample (n=360) of young PWID in these rural counties. An environmental assessment of policy and infrastructure will examine available services, needs and gaps. This phase will also build capacity to collect and deliver specimens for centralized HCV transmission investigation and molecular epidemiologic analysis.  In the UH3 phase, a Hybrid Type 1 implementation study will evaluate the effectiveness of a regionalized, integrated model of expanded service delivery for rural PWID. Using a stepped wedge design, the UH3 study will roll-out expanded services into primary care clinics and practices (PCCP) in these 15 rural northern New England counties using regional real-time tele-consultation, assessment and triage for HIV, hepatitis and OUD; and virtual, expert-facilitated bi-weekly case conferences around key topics (e.g., overdose prevention and HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP]). PWID recruited during the UG3 phase in intervention counties will be recontacted and referred to these PCCP sites. Primary outcomes will be the proportion of PWID: (1) with an initial assessment at a PCCP site (intake); (2) with an initial visit who initiated any treatment service within 30 days (initiation?); (3) who initiated then received 3 more services within 180 days of initiation (engagement?); and (4) discussed and followed via telemedicine (?retention?). Process evaluation will assess barriers, facilitators,implementationproblemsandnecessaryadaptations.Secondaryoutcomesincludetheproportion of PWID who receive: HAV/HBV vaccination and STI testing; naloxone rescue kits; and OUD, HIV and HCV treatment, including HIV suppression and sustained HCV response (SVR) among those who receive services.  This project is uniquely responsive to RFA-DA-17-014 in that it will provide in-depth understanding of high- risk rural PWID, inform community response strategies, and implement a comprehensive, integrated approach to treat OUD, reduce overdose and infectious complications among PWID in the rural US."
"9319734","CORE A - Optical mapping is a key methodology to be used throughout the program by all the projects. It will allow us to measure features of spinal cord injury-induced lower urinary tract pathology not obtainable by other approaches. These include functional measurement of neuropeptide release by afferent nerves, neural remodeling in the bladder and spinal cord and cell-cell interactions in bladder wall cross-sections and in-line primary cells. Therefore, the Imaging Core A, providing the support to set up and run experiments, will be central to the program. Co-directors of the core, Drs. Kanai and Salama, are experts in optical mapping using voltage- and Ca2+-sensitive dyes with a broad experience in application of this technique to study visceral organs, especially urinary bladder. They will provide three fully functional dual-imaging systems to measure voltage and Ca2+ signals from organs, tissues and cells in the bladder and spinal cord. Two of these are low resolution (256 pixels) fast acquisition (4000 frames/s) PDA systems that can record for minutes. The other is a high resolution (2.7 millon pixels) slow acquisition (540 frames/s) system that can record for seconds. The core will also offer commerically available as well as unique dyes (e.g., PGH-1 to PHG-Vl; developed by Drs. Guy Salama and Allen Waggoner) to measure membrane potential, intracellular Ca2+, K+ and nitric oxide, in vitro or in vivo. The core personnel will also offer expertise in dye delivery and acquisition using unique in-house software. This imaging apporach will utilize the genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator, GCaMP4, expressed through viral vectors, to selectively label sensory and motoneurons and their terminals. Thermoregulated ceramic chambers, custom-built by the core, will be available for recordings from the different preparations. Custom modifications to equipment and software will be provided as required. The core will coordinate the efficient use of imaging systems, assist with setting up experiments, analyzing data and troubleshooting. Imaging Core A will closely interact with Animal Core B for more efficient use of imaging systems and animals, taking into consideration the timepoints for treated animals and correlating them with the needs of individual projects."
"9369932","Project Summary  The long-term goal of my research is to comprehensively characterize the RNA structurome, here defined as the collection of all RNA structures and RNA-RNA interactions in living cells. RNA structures represent an important, yet under-appreciated, layer of genetic information that is essential for the interpretation and execution of the genomic blueprint. In this application for career development award, I have outlined research strategies that range from development of methods for RNA structure determination to functional characterization of RNA structures, which will eventually lead to applications to human diseases, the ultimate goal of genome medicine.  RNA structures and interactions are fundamental to RNA's diverse functions, such as guiding, scaffolding and catalysis. Not surprisingly, genetic alternations of RNA structures or helicases (enzymes that remodel RNA structures) underlie many human diseases, including various cancers. RNA viruses cause some of the most deadly human infections, and viral genomic RNA structures control critical steps in their lifecycle. However, only a few RNA structures have been determined due to lack of proper methods. To address this issue, I developed PARIS, a psoralen-crosslinking based method for high throughput mapping of RNA duplexes in living cells at single-molecule level with near base-pair resolution (Lu et al. 2016 Cell).  In this proposal, I will further increase the capabilities of PARIS by developing new high-efficiency photochemical crosslinkers (high solubility psoralens and bifunctional carbazoles) and resolution-refining enzymatic strategies. Based on the PARIS-determined structures, and integrating clustered interaction sites of RNA-binding proteins, I will test the hypothesis that RNA domains are structural and functional units of long non-coding RNAs. PARIS-determined structures also made it possible to conduct global screens for their functions using synthetic translation reporters. Systematic mutagenesis and screening of protein effectors will be used to dissect the mechanism of function for regulatory structural elements.  My previous training in a wide variety of topics that span computational and experimental biology set a solid foundation for my future success. To achieve my career goals goals, I have designed further training plans that will equip me with the critical skills in chemical biology, computational analysis and high throughput function screening. On one hand, I will obtain training through collaborations with Stanford faculty members, including my mentor Dr. Howard Chang an expert in chromatin and RNA biology, Dr. Eric Kool, an expert in photochemistry, Dr. Rhiju Das, an expert in computational biochemistry and RNA structure analysis, Dr. Peter Sarnow, an expert in translational control and RNA virus. The work conducted at Stanford will be well supported by the superb academic environment that includes all the intellectual interactions and necessary facilities. On the other hand, my team of collaborators includes international experts such as Dr. Edith Heard from the Curie Institute in France, who specializes in stem cell biology and X chromosome inactivation, and Dr. Eran Segal at the Weizmann Institute in Israel, who specializes in genomics and high throughput screens. Together, my support network provides me with the essential assistance for both scientific growth and career development.  In summary, the proposed studies will deliver a set of powerful tools to the broad RNA community for RNA structure determination, elaborate and validate the new concept of high-level RNA modularity, and provide new insights into RNA functions through multi-scale interrogation of RNA structures, from domains to single base pairs. Comprehensive characterization of the RNA structurome will uncover the regulatory mechanisms that translate the genome to phenotype, in both physiological and disease contexts. This training plan will not only establish a successful research program but will also facilitate my transition to an independent faculty position in a top research institute.  "
"9333275","Project 4 Abstract  The central goal of this project is to improve systemic therapies for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using  combinations of potent anticancer agents, chemosensitizers, and agents that target the tumor  microenvironment (TME). Many highly promising small-molecule cancer-targeting therapeutics fail due to poor  solubility, stability and other delivery related problems. Recent advances in nanoparticle (NP) drug delivery  vehicles provide a unique opportunity to ?rescue? these agents for clinical application. This is the focal point of  our research, which is to use NPs that can incorporate such agents and preferentially deliver them to tumors.  Our group has successfully developed a novel drug delivery platform based on poly(2-oxazoline) (POx)  polymeric micelles, that is well suited for the delivery of poorly soluble active drugs, such as paclitaxel (PTX).  Compared to conventional formulations and other NP platforms, our POx platform is unique in its high drug  loading capacity. Our preliminary data showed that such high drug loading translated into lower toxicity and  high therapeutic efficacy when we compared POx/PTX to both Taxol® and Abraxane®. The National  Characterization Laboratory has evaluated the PTX formulation using our lead POx block copolymer of poly(2-  butyl-2-oxozaline) (BuOx) and poly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline) (MeOx), and concluded that both the copolymer and  formulation lack immunological and hematological toxicities. Significantly, we have shown that multiple agents  can be co-formulated within the same POx micelles, enabling co-delivery of anticancer agents,  chemosensitizers, and TME-modifying compounds. Such combinations can increase cancer cell cytotoxicity  and modify the TME to enhance tumor control. We hypothesize that POx micelles can serve as a powerful and  versatile platform for delivery of such agents. We assembled a cross-disciplinary team of physician-scientists  and experts in nanotechnology, pharmacology, and chemoinformatics, and will focus our research efforts on  using POx micelle therapeutics in NSCLC, a disease that despite treatment advances, still has a very poor  outcome. The Specific Aims are: 1. Develop a predictive computational model for rapid selection and  incorporation of new and existing anticancer agents, chemosensitizers, and TME modifiers into POx micelles.  2. Evaluate chemosensitizers and anticancer agents incorporated in POx micelles as therapeutic modalities to  improve treatment of NSCLC. 3. Evaluate polymeric micelle formulations of agents that target the TME as a  treatment strategy. The computational model for rational design of formulations will drastically increase the  throughput and allow us to further develop new anti-cancer therapeutics through trans-Alliance collaborations  and other NCI mechanisms. Successful therapeutics will be advanced for further development. "
"9383204","Invasive brain interventions often result in complications and long recovery times. In addition, the delivery of therapeutic agents via the blood supply is often impossible because the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) protects the brain tissue from foreign molecules. Laboratory experiments and first clinical trials have shown that focused ultrasound (FUS) beams can be used for noninvasive interventions. However, the utilization of FUS in the brain has been seriously limited by the difficulty of delivering ultrasound through the skull bone. The hypothesis of this grant has been that trans-cranial therapeutic FUS exposures can be delivered noninvasively through an intact skull. This hypothesis has now been validated in multiple clinical studies that demonstrate that brain tissue can be noninvasively coagulated in the central part of the brain. During the current grant period, we furthered our initial research and developed methods to enhance FUS interaction with tissue using microbubbles, thus making whole brain sonications feasible. We have further studied the impact of ultrasound exposures on brain tissue and demonstrated chemotherapy delivery across the BBB. We have shown significant increases in animal survival with multiple treatments. We have shown similar gains by using targeted natural killer cells. We have also developed the methods for clinical BBB modulation for chemotherapy treatments using a current clinical device. Our study plan is to exploit our novel findings during this grant period and provide the methods for novel treatments. Our goals are: First, to utilize our method of super-resolution localization of individual microbubbles to explore the feasibility of micro-surgery and precision drug delivery. Second, to construct and test new array concepts that eliminate the need for a large waterbath and provide patient specific array geometry for repeated treatments. The impact of this research could be huge if even one of these new ideas could be translated to the clinic. For example, the methods proposed here could make tumor and epilepsy surgery available for a larger number of patients and the BBB modulation could increase the effectiveness of chemotherapy and potentially even provide treatments for patients with Alzheimer`s Disease."
"9328083","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mission for the NIH BioMEMS Resource Center (BMRC) is to bridge between microelectromechanicai systems (MEMS) and biomedical community to provide powerful microtechnologies to biomedical and clinical investigators. At its inception, the focus of the BMRC research was on the development of microfluidic chips for cell sorting, especially for fractionation of blood into its key components as well as the creation of living single cell arrays. In 2008, BMRC was renewed to expand its research portfolio to include rare cells with tremendous clinical potential, and more complex dynamic tissue microarrays. As we look to the next five years, BMRC is uniquely positioned to help advance the field because it maintains a core research program in the fundamentals of BioMEMS, while pushing the field forward with preclinical studies, translation activities, development of platform technologies, and disease modeling. To this end, we focused our efforts on 4 new Technology Research & Development (TR&D) Projects. In TR&D Project 1, we will develop two innovative technologies for the isolation of rare cells in blood or other bodily fluids. In TR&D Project 2, we will develop a point-of-care technology for rapid enrichment of fungi from blood for early diagnosis of fungemia. In TR&D Project 3, we will establish a multicompartment micro-device containing a 3-D skin compartment and a lymph node compartment, connected by microchannels. In TR&D Project 4, we will develop microfabricated devices with smart functionalities to examine brain injury including epilepsy and traumatic brain injury. Our TR&D Projects have spawned more than 40 well-integrated collaborative and service projects that feed into our fundamental technology research. The training activities include ad-hoc training, laboratory courses & workshops, and didactic courses. The dissemination activities are very broad encompassing outreach to lay press, scientific publications, web presence, symposia & meetings, and technology transfer. Thus, BMRC has been very successful in developing enabling technologies at the interface of MEMS & biomedicine, and disseminating them to the biomedical community."

The enclosed application is in response to RFA-DK-12-509, Limited Competition for the Continuation of the Assessment, Serial Evaluation, and Subsequent Sequelae of Acute Kidney Injury (ASSESS-AKI) Study (U01), on behalf of the Vanderbilt University Medical Center PCC. The six Specific Aims to be addressed by the participating PCC sites and Data Coordinating Center are: Aim 1) To re-enroll a high percentage of ASSESS-AKI participants into Phase 2; Aim 2) To maintain outstanding levels of retention, data quality and outcome ascertainment among ASSESS-AKI participants; Aim 3) To evaluate the association between AKI and markers of cardiac ischemia, fibrosis, and endothelial dysfunction as potential contributors to excess cardiovascular risk in patients with AKI; Aim 4) To examine the impact of AKI on the future development of metabolic disturbances among ASSESS-AKI participants; Aim 5) To employ unbiased proteomic techniques to identify novel urinary protein biomarkers at 3 months after an episode of transient AKI that identify patients at risk for progressive renal dysfunction; and Aim 6) To promote and support the conduct of ancillary studies in ASSESS-AKI, including collaboration with the broader nephrology research community. Through the ongoing participation of the PCCs, ASSESS-AKI-Phase 2 will become an unparalleled resource that will expand the science related to AKI natural history as well as the impact of AKI on the development and progression of CKD, cardiovascular disease, survival, quality of life, functional status and other important outcomes."
"9125859","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The need for mechanical ventilation (MV) secondary to sepsis is the leading cause of admission to the intensive care unit, often necessitating sedation for patient safety and comfort. Recently, we have learned that these sedative medications contribute to iatrogenic injury, such as prolonging ventilator time and ICU length of stay and exacerbating acute brain dysfunction. This acute brain dysfunction, manifested as delirium and coma, occurs in 50%-70% of MV septic patients and is a significant contributor not only to death but also to functional and cognitive decline, which can persist for years after recovery of lung and other organ function, levying significant costs to patients and society. Despite advances in the management of acute respiratory failure and sepsis, few clinical trials have examined the effects that supportive therapies, like sedation, may have on both short- and long-term outcomes in this vulnerable population. The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic benzodiazepines, in particular, have been shown to increase brain dysfunction, promote infection, and prolong MV. Therefore, the short-acting GABA-ergic sedative propofol and the alpha2 agonist dexmedetomidine are becoming widely used to sedate septic MV patients. There are only a few randomized trials, however, to guide clinicians when selecting between these and other sedatives, and none have explored the mechanisms underlying the differences in outcomes, though some data indicate that GABA-ergic and alpha2 agonist agents have very different effects on innate immunity, apoptosis, arousability, and respiratory drive. In early animal and human studies, dexmedetomidine had more anti-inflammatory effects than the GABA-ergic agents; dexmedetomidine improved bacterial clearance, whereas propofol impaired it. In addition, sedation with dexmedetomidine instead of benzodiazepines reduces delirium by 20%-30% and improves arousability, cognition, and attentiveness in ventilated patients. Alpha2 agonists induce unconsciousness at the brainstem- more akin to natural sleep-which may improve autonomic function and immunity. All these factors converge to suggest that sedation with an alpha2 agonist rather than a GABAergic agent may improve outcomes, including brain function, MV, and survival, for septic MV patients. We therefore propose the MENDS II (Maximizing the Efficacy of Sedation and Reducing Neurological Dysfunction and Mortality in Septic Patients with Acute Respiratory Failure) study, in which we will test the hypotheses that sedation of MV severely septic patients with an alpha2 agonist (dexmedetomidine) rather than a GABAergic agent (propofol) will (Aim 1A) increase days alive without delirium or coma, (Aim 1B) increase ventilator-free days, (Aim 2A) improve 90-day survival, (Aim 2B) decrease long-term cognitive impairment, and (Aim 3) reduce the pro-inflammatory cytokine cascade following sepsis. We will randomize 530 ventilated, severely septic patients requiring goal-directed sedation with dexmedetomidine or propofol, giving the study 90% power to detect a difference of 1.5 delirium/coma-free days and an absolute difference in mortality of 10% between the two groups."

"9543642","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of this Career Development Award (K99/R00) is to provide protected time for the candidate to obtain the necessary training and mentoring to establish an independent clinical research program for understanding physiological and psychological mechanisms underlying pain modulation and how these mechanisms contribute to Temporomandibular Joint Disorder (TMJD). The current proposal extends the candidate's previous background in stress and pain psychophysics with additional training to investigate physiological and psychological factors involved in the pathophysiology of TMJD. Specific training areas in the mentored phase of the K99 will help the candidate achieve several short-term goals including developing expertise in psychoneuroimmunology (PNI), psychological theory and assessment, and clinical exposure through guided mentorship, didactic coursework, and applied research experiences in healthy controls (HC) and in patients with TMJD. In addition, the training will establish the candidate as an independent clinical researcher by increasing his productivity, which will assist in obtaining a tenure-track faculty position and independent funding. Long term goals of the training include establishing an independent research laboratory to investigate physiological and psychological factors mediating clinical and experimental pain. The mentored phase of the K99 will take place at the University of Florida College of Dentistry under the direct mentorship of Dr. Roger Fillingim, Ph.D. and co-mentorship of Dr. Joseph Riley, Ph.D., both mentors are nationally and internationally respected experts in the field of pain and orofacial research. The environment is ideal for this project because the university places a strong emphasis on pain research including orofacial pain. The necessary laboratory, equipment, and supplies needed to complete the series of studies described in this proposal are available to the candidate. The research plan offers a series of studies that are designed to elucidate factors mediating the reduced efficacy of endogenous pain inhibition TMJD patients based on a model of conditioned pain modulation (CPM). In this model, pain inhibition is characterized by a reduction of heat pain sensitivity during exposure to a tonic conditioning stimulus. While the mechanisms remain unknown, the reduced pain inhibitory capacity in TMJD could be due to a maladaptive stress system, which is influenced by abnormal physiological (i.e., endogenous opioids, cholecystokinin) and psychological (i.e., catastrophizing) responses to pain. The research plan will use the skills developed during the career plan to investigate the impact of maladaptive neuroendocrine and pro-inflammatory immune responses and negative psychological reactions as important factors in reduced pain inhibition in TMJD. These observations will be accomplished by cross-sectional evaluations (Aim 1) and experimental manipulations of pain expectation (Aim 2). The candidate will use the skills and knowledge gained during the mentored training phase (K99) to transition to the independent (R00) phase. Aim 3 will investigate the interactions of endogenous opioid and cholecystokinin systems with psychological and biological responses to pain. The proposed series of studies will provide a more thorough understanding of endogenous pain modulation in patients who suffer with TMJD. Since it is the goal of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) to understand the causes of orofacial pain, the mechanisms underlying endogenous pain inhibition are a potential target that could assist in development of therapies to prevent and treat TMJD."
"9374283","Abstract The overall goal of the proposed research is to develop and validate high-resolution birefringence imaging. The intrinsic birefringence of collagen offers an attractive contrast mechanism to investigate the collagen morphology in human skin and scars. Non-invasive characterization of the collagen organization in scar tissue would facilitate clinical trials that investigate novel therapeutic approaches to reduce scarring by providing quantitative measures of treatment response. In addition, such a tool would also provide the ability to monitor, plan, and optimize therapeutic interventions based on objective metrics, and would help to combat the severe consequences that scarring can have on the quality of life of affected patients. However, current birefringence imaging methods lack the spatial resolution required to resolve individual collagen bundles. Specific Aim 1 improves the spatial resolution of a polarization sensitive optical frequency domain imaging (PS- OFDI) system. A new light source that synthetically combines two adjacent spectral regions into one broader spectrum will improve the axial resolution two-fold. And a short focal length objective lens will offer high lateral resolution. To manage the resulting reduction of the depth of field, multiple images with different focal positions will be acquired and merged into a single, high-resolution cross-sectional view. Specific Aim 2 develops and fabricates birefringence phantoms to validate the performance of PS-OFDI. Tissue-mimicking phantoms, fabricated from latex rubber and containing small zones of controllable, stress- induced birefringence, will provide a useful target to investigate the limits in spatial resolution and birefringence level of PS-OFDI. These insights will be essential for optimizing the reconstruction of tissue birefringence and for informing on the correct interpretation of birefringence features in biological tissues. Specific Aim 3 will image human skin and scar samples ex vivo. The collagen architecture imaged with PS- OFDI will be compared with matching histological sections to establish a catalog of birefringence features in normal skin and scars. With improved spatial resolution, PS-OFDI will be able to resolve individual collagen bundles, and provide comprehensive characterization of scar tissue. Image metrics that quantify the collagen architecture and that could serve in the future to assess scar severity will be developed. Combined, the successful completion of the proposed research would generate, characterize, and validate a powerful imaging method for non-invasive assessment of scarring in human skin."

"9312558","The objective of this proposal is to support the candidate's development and transition into an independent researcher. The outlined training plan will equip the applicant with the necessary skills to conduct innovative work that spans both primary research and clinical domains. The accrual of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology can begin decades before the onset of cognitive symptoms. Higher levels of pathology increase the risk of dementia, but the relationship between pathology and cognition is imperfect. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides a way to non-invasively assess the integrity of networks in the brain that support cognition. As such it may provide a better measure of the brain's health than biomarkers of pathology alone. Prior work using fMRI has almost exclusively utilized only episodic memory tasks. This approach is limited as AD leads to deficits beyond memory domains. The goal of Aim 1 is to characterize alterations in neural activity related to preclinical levels of AD pathology using three tasks that respectively target attentional control, working memory, and episodic memory. The goal of Aim 2 is to compare the sensitivity of these task-based fMRI paradigms to resting-state fMRI. The goal of Aim 3 is to relate task-based fMRI data to longitudinal cognition and the transition from cognitive normality to an impaired state. This work will improve our understanding of the relationship between AD pathology and neuronal activity, as well as the relationship between such fMRI activity and longitudinal cognition.  "
"9464303","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Novel multi-level intervention strategies are needed to combat the burgeoning pandemics of diabetes, obesity and their related comorbidities among highly impacted populations. Neighborhood environments and Latino health have only been studied in one large cohort study to date, The Multi Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. We propose a cost-effective ancillary study, submitted in response to PAR-13-302, that leverages existing data from the Hispanic Community Health Study - Study of Latinos (HCHS-SOL), while adding comprehensive neighborhood environment assessments and Visit 2 physical activity assessments to this ongoing cohort study. The proposed study is timely because the rapidly growing Latino population, particularly Mexican Americans, experience disproportionally high rates of cardiometabloic diseases such as diabetes and obesity. In this study we will investigate neighborhood environment impacts on cardiometabolic health in the HCHS/SOL San Diego cohort (N = 1750 Mexican Americans) using an innovative and comprehensive Social-Ecological Model that considers multiple pathways linking both macro- and micro-scale built and social neighborhood factors to cardiometabolic health using a longitudinal framework. Six year trajectories in cardiometabolic outcomes will be derived from comprehensive clinical assessments during 2008-2011 (Visit 1) and 2015-2018 (Visit 2). Physical activity was/will be assessed at Visits 1 and 2 using accelerometry and validated self-report. Chronic stress and social support will be assessed using validated self-reports at Visit 2, while depression was/will be assessed at both visits. Macro-scale neighborhood attributes (e.g., residential density, median household income) will be derived from GIS and public source data such as the American Community Survey using 1km street-network buffers around participants' homes. Micro-scale attributes (e.g., safety of street crossings, aesthetics/social disorder) will be assessed using systematic direct observations of participants' neighborhoods. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal structural equation models will be used to investigate direct and indirect (through physical activity, depression, chronic stress, and social support) effects of neighborhood environments on a cardiometabolic composite score comprised of the Metabolic Syndrome components (i.e., waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, HDL-cholesterol, fasting glucose and fasting triglycerides). As posited in Social-Ecological Models, we powered this study to test mediation (through the aforementioned behavioral and psychosocial pathways) and interactions among neighborhood attributes (e.g., built and social). By improving understanding of neighborhood effects on Latino health, this project will inform health-supportive neighborhood interventions in high-need areas, as well as behavioral and psychosocial interventions to minimize the negative health impacts of unsupportive neighborhood environments."
"9359713","ABSTRACT This R24 resource proposal seeks to promote broad and cost-effective usage of rat models through generation and distribution of a panel of popular Cre/lox knockin rats. Rats have long been used as models that better replicate human physiology and pathophysiology than do mice and are the preferred model for the study of many human diseases. Use of rats to model human disease, however, has been limited until recently by the inability to generate germline-competent rat embryonic stem (ES) cells, precluding the use of ES-cell based approaches to produce conditional/inducible knockout rats. In 2010, we generated the first gene knockout rats by homologous recombination-based gene targeting in ES cells. More recently, we have generated a panel of genetically modified rat lines including gene knockout, knockin of point mutation, knockin of reporters, Cre drivers, and floxed rats. A major strength of the ES cell approach is the ability, in conjunction with Cre/lox technology, to generate rats in which genes are inactivated at specific times and/or in specific tissues or organs. We have assembled a strong group of investigators with complementary expertise to develop a panel of universal Cre/lox reporter rats (Aim 1), cell-specific and inducible Cre rats (Aim 2), and floxed rats in which specific genes of interest are flanked by loxP sites (Aim 3). These Cre/lox rats will allow investigators to visualize specific cell types in situ and can also serve as the basis for the generation of conditional/inducible knockout rats. Cre/lox rats generated in this project will be distributed through the Missouri Rat Resource and Research Center (RRRC) (Aim 4). Availability of these rats would combine the significant biological advantages of the rat with the genetic tractability of the mouse, providing investigators with a highly relevant in vivo model with which to study the contributions of specific genes and pathways to pathogenesis of a number of important human diseases."
"9322318","ABSTRACT Hepatorenal Fibrocystic Diseases (HRFDs) are a group of heterogeneous disorders that together are a major cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in children and adults. Current treatments are largely directed toward managing disease symptoms.

The Administrative Core is tasked with setting priorities and the overall scientific and clinical research direction of the Center. Additionally, the Administrative Core is responsible for coordinating activities between the HRFDCC and other NIH and University-supported Centers. This includes joint educational, mentoring, and career development activities with other P30-PKD Centers, the CTSAs at each of the HRFDCC institutions, and with the UAB/UCSD O'Brien Center and the UAB Nephrology Research and Training Center (NRTC). The Administrative Core will organize an annual internal and external review of all the Center's Programs and be responsible for ensuring that changes recommended by the Advisory Committees are implemented. A final important role of the Administrative Core is to maintain effective communication and collaborative interactions between the HRFDCC and the Investigator Base to provide updated information about the Center's services and resources, as well as new funding, educational, and training opportunities. This will be accomplished through a content-rich website and video conferencing of our seminar series and workshops, as well as national meetings and direct correspondence with the Investigator Base. Taken together, the Administrative Core will oversee the day-to-day operations of the Center and ensure that we are enhancing junior scientist development, expanding the research base interested in HRFDs, and are providing cost-effective services and the infrastructure that will accelerate the pace of discovery research, improve diagnostics, and expedite the development of novel treatments for HRFDs."
"9351292","Project Summary In 2014 there were an estimated 9.6 million cases of tuberculosis (TB) disease with 1.5 million deaths due to TB, more deaths than from any other single infectious agent. Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG), a live attenuated Mycobacterium bovis (M.bovis), is the only licensed vaccine against TB. Although it is efficacious against severe forms of childhood TB when administered to newborn infants, it provides little or no protection against pulmonary TB in adolescents/adults, who are the major source of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) transmission. It is pulmonary TB in these older age groups that drives the global epidemic. There is a critical need for TB research and development of new, improved tools, especially new and more effective TB vaccines, in order to reach the World Health Organization?s (WHO) goal of ending the TB epidemic by 2035 and achieving the similar United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goal of ending TB by 2030. Live-attenuated vaccination strategies may be the best approach for conferring durable T-cell immune responses, believed to be necessary for protecting against TB. MTBVAC is a novel, live-attenuated Mtb vaccine based on deletion of two independent genes encoding major virulence factors, but retaining Mtb genes not present in BCG. Because MTBVAC is based on live, attenuated Mtb, and therefore presents a wider collection of Mtb- specific antigens to the host immune system than BCG, it may provide better protection. We aim, in a Phase 1b/2a, double-blind, randomized, BCG-controlled, dose-ranging study, to evaluate MTBVAC in adults with and without prior Mtb infection (Latent TB Infection; LTBI) to obtain critical safety and immunogenicity data to guide dose selection and to facilitate the advancement of MTBVAC into efficacy trials in TB endemic countries. Participants will have received previous BCG vaccination in infancy. The primary endpoint is comparison of the safety profile of intradermal MTBVAC injection at each of four dose levels compared to BCG revaccination. The proposed trial will be conducted in South Africa which has the second highest annual TB incidence in the world (834 per 100,000). Investment in MTBVAC is important as it has 1) shown promising results 2) is the only live attenuated Mtb vaccine currently in clinical development (first in class) and 3) contains additional antigens to M.bovis, the progenitor of the current vaccine BGC, and therefore may provide enhanced protection against TB."

"9352310","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nicotine addiction continues to be a major problem in the US with smoking accounting for the loss of 443,000 lives and an estimated $193 billion economic burden each year. These staggering statistics speak to important of identifying factors that contribute to nicotine addiction. Cognitive deficits such as disrupted learning are a major symptom of nicotine withdrawal, yet little is understood about the genetic factors that contribute to nicotine withdrawal-related changes in cognition. Identifying the neural and genetic substrates of nicotine withdrawal deficits in cognition will provide data to facilitate drug discovery and identify markers for at risk populations. Use of genetic data to identify at risk populations could also facilitate development of treatments that could increase the likelihood of maintaining abstinence. Recent data from a study examining nicotine withdrawal-related changes in hippocampus-dependent learning in mice demonstrated that genetics contributes to this cognitive withdrawal phenotype. As the specific genes involved in this withdrawal phenotype are unknown, it is the goal of this application to use next-generation sequencing to identify gene variants related to nicotine withdrawal deficits in learning. Studies in the proposal will use the recombinant inbred (RI) BXD strain to characterize phenotypic differences across BXD lines (Aim 1) and use that data for quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis to identify genes associated with the nicotine withdrawal learning deficit phenotype (Aim 2). In addition, BXD databases will be examined to identify other phenotypes that are genetically correlated with the cognitive withdrawal phenotype (Aim 2). Finally, RNA-sequencing in BXD lines that show extreme phenotypic variation will be used to identify changes in the transcriptome associated with the nicotine withdrawal deficit in learning phenotype. These studies should significantly advance understanding of and treatment of nicotine addiction. Identifying genes and gene expression changes that are associated with nicotine withdrawal deficits in learning in the mouse will facilitate identifying if homologous genes in humans that are associated with nicotine withdrawal deficits in cognition. This could help practitioners tailor treatments to patients. In addition, identifying specific changes in the transcriptome associated with nicotine withdrawal deficits in learning will provide valuable information on the changes in cell signaling that contribute to nicotine withdrawal deficits in learning and this should aid in identifying potential targets for pharmacotherapeutic development."
"9362960","Low nephron endowment causes hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage renal disease requiring renal replacement therapy in children and adults. The premise of multi-potent progenitor cell- based replacement therapy for individuals with low nephron endowment critically depends on scientific and technical advances that foster efficient propagation of native or pluripotent cell-derived nephron progenitor cells (NPC). Genetic and functional analyses in mice indicate that NPC residing in the cap mesenchyme ?age? during maturation, i.e., while Young E13 NPC stay in the niche and engage in self-renewal, Old P0- P2 NPC have a shorter life span because they exit the niche at a higher rate and differentiate into nascent nephrons. The biological basis of NPC aging is not well understood. Changes in the niche microenvironment are not sufficient to explain Old NPC's greater propensity to differentiate since P2-NPC cannot sustain their progenitor state even in optimal growth factor media. Our preliminary studies using genome-wide mapping of open (accessible) chromatin identified intrinsic age-associated chromatin state transitions in Young and Old NPC. This exciting finding prompted us to hypothesize that Old NPC are epigenetically ?primed? for differentiation, which contributes to their limited life span. Specific Aim 1 will utilize an integrative system biology approach to delineate the active enhancer landscape and transcriptional regulatory network of the Young and Old NPC. We will construct a comprehensive map of the age-dependent chromatin state transitions in freshly isolated Young (E13) and Old (P0-P2) NPC, and integrate this knowledge with enhancer histone signatures, transcriptional profiles, and transcription factor occupancy. We will also determine whether ex vivo expansion triggers remodeling of the chromatin landscape by comparing the epigenomic profiles of native and expanded Young and Old NPC. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) restrains remodeling of differentiation gene enhancers in the Young NPC. Using gene targeting and epigenome profiling, we will demonstrate the critical role of PRC2 in controlling access to enhancers of Cdkn2a/p16 and Wnt4. We will utilize CRISPR dCas9-targeted epigenome editing to re-write the histone signature of developmental enhancers and rejuvenate the PRC2-mutant NPC. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to advance the field of kidney development in general, but it will especially benefit the efforts of nephron regeneration. Knowledge of the enhancer landscape of nephron progenitors during maturation, which does not currently exist, can potentially open the way to development of targeted epigenetic therapy to maintain the stemness or rejuvenate the aging NPC, and to refine existing NPC propagation protocols."

To develop the next generation of HIV/AIDS  investigators, both SWGs will implement processes specifically designed to attract new and junior  investigators, will provide an environment that fosters effective mentorship, and will assure that each  new/junior investigator has a specific mentor. These SWGs will be highly data-driven, working with the  Administrative Core and the Biostatistics and Biomedical Informatics Core to develop REDCap databases to  collect and disseminate real-time data on SWG performance. Among the most important outcome measures  will be: 1) high impact publications with trans-institutional, trans-disciplinary authorship; and 2) new grant  submissions and awards that are trans-institutional and trans-disciplinary. Additional data collected and  evaluated will include extent of engagement from all three partner institutions and community stakeholders,  new and junior investigators, and mentors identified for junior investigators. Each SWG includes an innovative  concept project led by a mentored junior investigator to be initiated in Year 1 of the TN-CFAR."
"9326346","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) is the most common movement disorder affecting over one million people in North America alone and results in an insidious reduction in the quality of life and ability to function. A hallmark of PD is the brain accumulation of neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions comprised of the protein a-synuclein, but the presence of ?-synuclein brain aggregates is observed in a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases, including dementia with Lewy body. Several findings suggest that ?-synuclein amyloid pathology may spread during disease progression by a self-templating alteration in protein conformation mechanism, however other alternative and/or synergistic biological mechanisms, as supported by our data, could also lead to progression of ?-synuclein pathology. From a therapeutic aspect it is critical to determine the relative importance, mechanisms and physiological consequences of the spread of ?-synuclein aggregation in disease. It this proposal, two major specific aims are proposed to inform on ?-synuclein induced and spread of disease: 1) Using both wild-type and disease causing mutant forms of  ?-synuclein with unique aggregation properties, we will directly investigated that a-synuclein aggregation can spread within the central nervous system and from the periphery with specific conformational characteristics. 2) We will assess the importance of alternative biological mechanisms including perturbation of the protein network homeostasis, neuronal intermediate filament integrity, neurotoxicity and age-related changes in the induction and propagation of ?-synuclein pathology by exogenous a-synuclein challenges. These studies will provide critical insights on the mechanisms and the involvement of ?-synuclein aggregation in PD disease progression with the objective of guiding the development of novel therapeutics."
"9241777","PROJECT SUMMARY Data from our previous funding period and supporting evidence from other INIA-Neuroimmune (INIA-N) laboratories provide the foundation for the overall hypothesis of this proposal: Behavioral changes characteristic of excessive alcohol consumption and alcohol use disorder (AUD) are due, in part, to neuroimmune mechanisms that significantly reshape the transcriptome. Drug repurposing algorithms can analyze cross-species transcriptome changes to predict compounds that reduce alcohol consumption. We propose that brain dysfunction in alcoholics is the result of dysregulation in both the protein coding and non-coding transcriptome. Advances in genomic studies by our research team and INIA-N collaborators have enabled us to generate transcriptome data on an unprecedented scale. Devising methods to visualize and analyze these data to produce meaningful biological interpretation is one of the next important steps. We aim to take full advantage of the emerging technologies, allowing us to move forward in the post- genomic, ?big data? era. We previously used RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to define the transcriptome in four brain regions of 90 human cases (alcoholics and matched controls). In addition to identifying novel splice variants and co-variation with lifetime alcohol consumption, we identified novel changes in long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in human brain and propose that these play an important role in gene expression changes. Differentially expressed lncRNAs that are correlated with alcohol consumption and have syntenic conservation between humans and mice will be prioritized for genetic and behavioral testing in mice in collaboration with INIA-N investigators. Other interactions involve mining the RNA-Seq transcriptome profiles in human subjects and macaque to link expression changes with genetic differences found in the Collaborative Studies on Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA). This will allow us to define, in unprecedented detail, changes in RNA splicing and pathways constructed from detected single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Finally, we will study the convergence of transcriptome changes in human, macaque, and rodent brain to determine which rodent models reflect the gene expression changes seen in human AUD. The overlapping changes in expression and associated networks produced by excessive alcohol consumption can be used to predict drugs that will normalize the network using cutting-edge computational analyses. Thus, we and INIA-N collaborators will utilize our combined transcriptome data to predict novel therapeutics based on cross-species convergence of gene networks and then test FDA-approved drugs predicted to target the affected networks in mouse and rat models of excessive alcohol consumption. The most promising drugs will then be selected for testing in human alcoholics. These efforts integrate advanced computational, genomic, molecular, functional system, and behavioral studies to be integrated into a systematic framework designed to advance treatment strategies for AUD."

"9370186","Project Summary/Abstract  A clear relationship between amyloid precursor protein (APP), amyloid beta (A?), and mitochondria exists. APP and A? influence mitochondrial function, while mitochondrial function and bioenergetic pathways influence APP processing. Several studies indicate reductions in mitochondrial respiratory flux decrease A? production. Conversely, parameters which increase mitochondrial respiratory flux increase A? production. The overall goal of this study is to determine how bioenergetics influence APP processing pathways. Our preliminary data support a role for mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in modulating the production of A?. Based on these findings, we hypothesize mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial derived ROS influence APP processing. We will elucidate the involvement of these bioenergetic intermediates in APP processing pathways and determine how these changes occur. We hypothesize bioenergetics influence APP processing pathways by modulating the cellular localization and trafficking of APP, ?-, and ?-secretases. To this end our proposed studies will explore fundamental relationships between mitochondria, energy metabolism-related phenomena, and A? production. These studies could potentially advance our understanding of Alzheimer?s disease (AD)-associated cascades while also providing translational and relevant insight. Understanding the relationship between A? production and bioenergetics will provide additional clues to the nexus between brain aging and AD, and novel therapeutic targets.  This K99/R00 award is designed to further Dr. Wilkins? career path by complimenting her current training and developing expertise in new areas. These new areas include reprogramming induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), ?-, and ?-secretase biology. At the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC), Dr. Wilkins will work in the neurology department, where the director of the Alzheimer?s Disease Center (Dr. Russell Swerdlow) is her primary mentor.

"9372832","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Adolescent depression is a substantial public health problem which contributes to academic failure, poor social function, substance use disorders, teen pregnancy, chronic morbidity, and completed suicides. Existing treatment approaches for adolescent depression such as psychotherapy and antidepressant medications are often ineffective and do not target relevant neurobiology. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) is a Food and Drug Administration approved treatment of major depressive disorder in adults. In clinical practice 10 Hz (high frequency) rTMS is typically used to treat depression but prior studies suggest that 1 Hz (low frequency) rTMS may be as effective, more tolerable, and safer compared to 10 Hz rTMS. Initial studies of rTMS for adolescent depression are promising but the optimal dosing and brain effects of rTMS treatments may be different than adults. One theory is that treatment with rTMS impacts gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate neurotransmitters. However, there are no biomarker approaches or clinical profiles to guide rTMS treatments in adolescents. To solve these problems we propose a novel dose finding and target validation study of rTMS for adolescent depression with a biomarker stratified randomized design. Depressed adolescents will be stratified according to a baseline measure of cortical glutamatergic tone called intracortical facilitation (ICF) and then randomized to six weeks of 1 Hz or 10 Hz rTMS treatment applied to the L-DLPFC. We will determine if baseline measures of ICF predict antidepressant response to 1 Hz or 10 Hz rTMS in depressed adolescents and if ICF measures change over time with successful rTMS treatment. The research team will study and develop biomarkers of GABA and glutamate tone with ultrahigh-field, 7 tesla (7 T) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) measures of the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. We will also examine the effect of baseline anhedonia and historical adversity on treatment response to rTMS with the aim of understanding these clinical characteristics and developing clinical treatment targets with links to GABA and glutamate tone. We hypothesize that depressed adolescents with high baseline ICF measures will have a greater antidepressant response (assessed by greater decrease in Children?s Depression Rating Scale-Revised scores) to 1 Hz rTMS while depressed adolescents with low baseline ICF will have a greater antidepressant response to 10 Hz rTMS. We also hypothesize that 1 Hz rTMS will increase cortical GABA and decrease cortical glutamate, while 10 Hz rTMS will decrease cortical GABA and increase cortical glutamate (measured with bilateral 7 T MRS of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortices). The proposed research program will answer important questions regarding the neurobiology of adolescent depression, the mechanisms of rTMS treatments in adolescents, and dosing rTMS in adolescent depression. Findings will inform larger studies of rTMS and the development of novel treatments for adolescent depression."
"9409805","Abstract Antibody subclass has been critically linked to variable potency in the anti-viral activity of polyclonal antibodies: variation in IgG subclass switching has been associated with variable vaccine efficacy; and in natural infection, subclass switching has been associated with variable viral suppression. Furthermore, in a number of studies, subclass switched variants of bnAbs have strongly modulated not only their effector function via tuning of interactions with Fc receptors, but neutralization breadth and potency. These observations suggest that antibody subclass may be a key parameter of antibody activity in vivo?contributing both to enhanced viral recognition, neutralization capacity, as well as innate immune recognition via Fc receptors, suggesting that better understanding of both the signals associated with and the significance of subclass switching will contribute to the development of a protective HIV vaccine. We hypothesize that IgG subclass composition contributes significantly to antiviral protection and can be rationally modulated by vaccination. We propose a 3- pronged approach to generalize our understanding of the significance of subclass switching to protections from HIV infection. First, we will evaluate diverse monoclonal HIV-specific antibodies across a variety of in vitro anti- viral antibody activities in IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 forms. Second, we will evaluate whether the unique IgG3 hinge topology imparts a general enhancement in neutralization potency by comparing the activity of monovalent Fab and bivalent Fab'2 fragments from polyclonal donor serum. Lastly, we will compare the efficacy of subclass switched monoclonal antibodies in in vivo viral challenge experiments in a humanized mouse model. Additionally, the signals associated with subclass-specific class switch recombination in human B cells are poorly defined in comparison with mouse B cells. A greater understanding of the stimuli and their downstream molecular regulators that promote IgG3 responses would help guide the design of vaccine formulations that would bias HIV responses towards IgG subclasses that are protective and away from those that are ineffective or detrimental. To determine the mechanisms controlling IgG subclass selection, first, we will identify and characterize the cytokines and co-stimulatory signals that promote optimal class switching to IgG3 in purified B cell cultures. Second, we will specifically as well as systematically target intracellular regulators of class switch recombination to and away from IgG3."
"9511956","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Personalized medicine is predicated on having sufficient patient specific information to provide a diagnosis specific to that patient. Genomics (e.g. next generation sequencing) is now being adopted into clinical practice and is enabling improvements in patient specific care particularly in cancer. However, sequence information alone will not be sufficient to realize the full potential of personalized medicine. If we examine prostate cancer, more than half of patients do not benefit from new anti-cancer therapies such as Abiraterone and Enzalutamide and nearly all patients who initially benefit develop resistance within 1-2 years. Yet, for the clinician the treatment decisions are largely guesswork as he/she has little quantitative mechanistic data to guide treatment choices. Importantly, prostate cancer is driven in large part by the Androgen Receptor (AR) including ligand binding and translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus activating a transcriptional program critical to tumorigenesis. Multiple drugs are currently available that prevent nuclear translocation of the AR via different mechanisms, but sequencing alone will be insufficient to accurately guide therapy choice and to monitor the development of resistance (similar scenarios exist in other cancers and other diseases). Predicting and monitoring targeted therapies requires orthogonal multi-omic (i.e., protein, genomic, gene expression) endpoints. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have great potential as an accessible sample and many technologies are being developed for CTC analysis, but none have the ability to perform multi-omic analysis from a single sample. This proposal addresses these issues by leveraging and advancing Exclusion-based Sample Preparation (ESP) to enable the rapid and efficient isolation of multiple analytes (cells, proteins RNA, DNA) from a single precious sample with high recovery and purity. To efficiently move this platform into the clinic, we have signed licensing agreements with Gilson and Foundation Medicine (recently acquired by Roche) industry leaders in instrumentation/manufacturing, and advanced cancer diagnostics/clinical laboratory test development respectively. Additionally our clinical collaborator, Dr. Lang (University of Wisconsin), will enable us to directly demonstrate the clinical efficacy of our multi-omic approach during the SBIR proposal period, using advanced prostate cancer as a clinical model. As illustrated by the AR model system, assays capable of measuring multi-omic biomarkers would enable clinicians to make more informed decisions about what type of therapy to use and when to use it for patients with progressive disease, informing both choice of initial treatment as well as when to switch therapy as resistance occurs. We have chosen to submit a Fast-Track SBIR Proposal and have addressed the Fast-Track requirements of clear Phase I goals and clear evidence (e.g. letters) of additional funding & resource commitments that significantly enhance the likelihood of successful commercialization."
"9367468","Project Abstract Cerebral infarction (stroke) in sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most dramatic and life altering complications of the disease, resulting in physical limitations and potential learning disabilities. Evidence suggests that aberrant leukocyte-endothelial interactions and vascular remodeling might be important contributors to the pathobiology of cerebral vasculopathy and stroke in SCD. Our overall goal is to define the potential role of leukocyte- endothelial adhesion and vascular remodeling in the pathobiological mechanism of cerebral vasculopathy and cerebral infarct in SCD. Identifying molecules with significant role in these pathobiological mechanisms could provide a potentially novel drug target for stroke prevention. In our preliminary data we combined two photon laser scanning microscopy (TPLSM) and MRI/MRA in 12 months old Townes humanized sickle cell mice. This approach enabled us to conduct in vivo imaging documenting the occurrence of abnormal vasodynamic measures (higher RBC velocity and flux), cerebral vasculopathy (vessel tortuosity), and cerebral infarcts in sickle cell compared to control mice. Because our outcomes were spontaneously developing, we are poised to be able to determine the potential factors such as leukocyte-endothelial adhesion and/or aberrant angiogenesis that could be driving the evolution of cerebral vasculopathy and infarction. Our hypothesis is that the spontaneous onset and propagation of cerebral vasculopathy in SCD is due in part to aberrant leukocyte-endothelial interaction and vascular remodeling, mediated by increased endothelial activation and a proangiogenic milieu. Sickle cell mice with genetic or pharmacologic blockade of mediators of leukocyte-endothelial interaction and angiogenesis will be generated and used. These mice will be prospectively imaged alongside appropriate controls using the combination of TPLSM and MRI/MRA for development of cerebral vasculopathy and infarcts. Our specific aims are 1) To determine the spatio-temporal relationship between the presence and/or location of cerebral vasculopathy and incidence, size and number of cerebral infarcts in SCD. This will enable us further validate our model and potentially establish the age of onset for cerebral vasculopathy and infarct in sickle mice. 2) To determine the role of aberrant leukocyte-endothelial interaction in the onset and progression of cerebral vasculopathy and cerebral infarcts. This will allow us to determine whether adhesion molecules already well documented to be associated with known SCD vascular complications are contributors to the pathobiology of cerebral vasculopathy or infarcts and could be potential targets of stroke prevention. 3) To determine the role of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and placenta growth factor (PlGF) in cerebral vascular remodeling, vasculopathy and stroke in SCD. Here we will determine the involvement of angiogenic molecules in the pathobiology of cerebral vasculopathy or infarct in SCD. Also to show whether blocking signaling from these molecules a useful strategy for stroke prevention. Achieving these aims will significantly advance our knowledge of the mechanisms of stroke in SCD."

"9332368","ABSTRACT  The role of DNA damage response signaling in chronic kidney disease. Nephronophthisis (NPHP) is an autosomal recessive chronic kidney disease (CKD), characterized by tubulointerstitial fibrosis, tubular basement membrane disruption and kidney cysts. Renal fibrosis is the primary determinant of end-stage kidney disease, with no effective therapy available today. Recent work has identified NPHP as a ?ciliopathy?, caused by mutations in genes, whose proteins localize to the centrosome and/or primary cilium, and has generated a unifying pathogenic concept for NPHP-related ciliopathies (NPHP-RC). Despite the identification of mutations in more than 30 genes as causative of NPHP-RC, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease. Recently, by whole exome resequencing I was involved in the identification of 3 novel genes ? CEP164, FAN1 and SDCCAG8 as causing NPHP-RC with renal degeneration/fibrosis when mutated. Surprisingly, the centrosomal proteins CEP164 and SDCCAG8 were also localized at cell nuclei, and their inactivation led to impaired DNA damage response (DDR) signaling accompanied by cell cycle defects. Hence, together with FAN1, which is a known DNA damage repair protein, CEP164 and SDCCAG8 implicate defective DDR signaling as a novel pathomechanism of NPHP-RC.  I hypothesize that renal degeneration/fibrosis in NPHP-RC is caused by defects in DNA damage response pathways. To test this hypothesis, I will (1) examine the role of ?ciliopathy proteins? in regulating the DNA damage response pathway using the Cep164 and Sdccag8 mouse models of renal fibrosis; (2) perform a high-throughput screen for small molecules that influence and counteract the NPHP-RC pathogenesis; (3) characterize the functions and regulation of trafficking of CEP164 and SDCCAG8 between their dual localizations at centrosomes and in nuclei. Accomplishment of the proposed research will provide (1) new insights into the pathomechanisms of ciliopathies; (2) new chemical compounds that can lead to therapies for NPHP-RC and renal fibrosis; (3) new animal models for studying DDR-related diseases.  The objective of this K99/R00 application is to utilize the newly generated animal models for the study of molecular mechanisms of NPHP-RC. This will facilitate the transition of my research career towards an independent investigator position. The training (K99) phase of this award will be mentored by Dr. Friedhelm Hildebrandt, who is an investigator of Howard Hughes Medical Institute and internationally recognized leader in the fields of human genetics and of pediatric kidney diseases. In March 2013 I will move to the Boston Children's Hospital (BCH)/Harvard Medical School (HMS) with Dr. Hildebrandt's laboratory. My long-term career goal is to establish myself as an independent investigator in the field of kidney research, focusing on animal models of kidney diseases. The BCH/HMS has several collaborative research groups working on kidney development and diseases providing an ideal environment for my training and career development."
"9402971","7. Project summary/Abstract Leydig cells within the testis are the source of androgens that promote virility at both fetal and adult stages, but Leydig cell populations are distinct at each age. As such, adult and fetal Leydig cells function to synthesize testosterone in distinct cellular and endocrine environments. The AIMs of this proposal are focused on regulation of Star, the known gatekeeper in controlling access of cholesterol to enzymatic activity of the series of steroidogenic enzymes required for conversion to testosterone. Here we focus on novel regulatory events that exert dynamic interactions with Star chromosomal loci that will explain how fluctuating Star transcript accumulation can relate to changes in androgen synthesis. Previously, we used high-resolution fluorescent in situ hybridization (HR-FISH) to localize and quantify a unique pattern for primary, spliced, and mRNA species accumulation for Star compared to other steroidogenic genes within single Leydig cells. We will use this and other innovative techniques to compare results from studies that investigate individual adult and fetal Leydig cells in vitro, within MA10 cells and primary cultures, and in vivo, within whole testes. Pulsatile LH stimulates primarily cAMP/PKA signals to promote testosterone synthesis in adult Leydig cells. While we have substantial means to explain how Star transcription is turned ON by LH/PKA, we understand little about what happens when the pulse is removed, and even less about the interpulse interval. In AIM 1, we will test the hypothesis that the events occurring at Star loci during this interval are just as critical to controlling testosterone output as the initial stimulus. Meanwhile, the external stimuli that maintain androgen synthesis in fetal Leydig cells are less clear, but evidence points to paracrine signals, with PKA activity playing a role. Another paracrine factor, Sertoli cell-derived Desert Hedgehog (Hh) is known to initiate fetal Leydig cell differentiation, but its role in their maintenance has not been tested. Once differentiated, fetal Leydig cells produce androgens at a steadily increasing rate until late gestation. Therefore, in AIM 2, we will test the hypothesis that regulatory events on Star loci facilitate a controlled increase in androgens within the fetal Leydig cell that compare to those that occur during the interpulse interval in adult Leydig cells. Our findings have the potential to explain fundamental biology underlying steroidogenic control and will have a profound impact on our ability to explore mechanisms by which disturbances in testosterone synthesis, as in endocrine disruption, cause significant clinical ramifications in males from all stages of life."
"9375834","Project Summary Mitochondrial dysfunction in cardiac myocytes occurs early in the pathogenesis of heart failure. In the heart, the primary function of mitochondria is to meet the high energy demand of the beating myocytes by providing ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. However, mitochondria can quickly change into death?promoting organelles. In response to changes in the intracellular environment, they can become excessive producers of reactive oxygen species and release pro-death proteins. Not surprisingly, cells have developed defense mechanisms against aberrant mitochondria that can cause harm to it. The ability of a cell to repair itself and prevent unnecessary death is particularly important in a post-mitotic cell such as a myocyte that cannot be easily replaced. Studies have found that dysfunctional mitochondria can be sequestered by autophagosomes and subsequently delivered to lysosomes for degradation. However, the mechanism and regulation of mitochondrial removal are not well characterized and whether additional mechanisms of mitochondrial clearance exist is currently unclear. We have previously found that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin plays an important role in clearing dysfunctional mitochondria in the heart in response to stress and lack of Parkin leads to accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria after a myocardial infarction. Parkin is known to induce autophagy of mitochondria but our preliminary studies have uncovered evidence that Parkin can also promote clearance of mitochondria via an autophagy-independent mechanism. In this proposal, we will explore the hypothesis that the small GTPase Rab5 and the endosomal degradation pathway play an important role in clearing dysfunctional mitochondria in myocytes. This hypotheses will be tested with two aims. Aim 1 will define the functional importance of Rab5 and endosomal-mediated mitochondrial clearance in myocytes in vitro and in vivo. We will also examine the relationships between the endosomal pathway and traditional/alternative autophagy pathways in the heart. In Aim 2, we will delineate the role of Beclin1 in initiating the endosomal pathway in response to mitochondrial damage. We will examine whether Beclin1 regulates activation of the endosomal degradation pathway in response to cellular stress by forming a specific pro-endosomal complex with Rab5 and Vps34. Loss-of-function studies in vitro and in vivo using unique cardiac specific inducible Beclin1 deficient mice will be utilized to confirm the functional importance of Beclin1 initiating formation of early endosomes in response to mitochondrial damage and stress. These studies will provide important novel insight into how dysfunctional and potentially dangerous mitochondria are cleared in the heart. These studies will also provide insights into new potential therapeutic targets in this pathway."
"9283076","Convection-enhanced delivery (CED), a modality in which a stereotactic-guided small-caliber catheter is inserted through the skull and dura, has promisingly improved drug delivery permitting local infusion of therapeutic drugs directly into the brain parenchyma and effectively circumventing the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We conceived the idea of a Convection-Enhanced Thermo-chemotherapy Catheter System (CETCS), which will deliver therapies broadly to the primary tumor site, like glioblastoma (GBM) and tumor infiltrative cells (extending ~2 cm) with high coverage volume, thereby diminishing the likelihood of recurrence. We have invented a novel CETCS consisting of a catheter housing 7 arborizing fiber optic micro-needles that allows simultaneous, localized delivery of laser energy and therapy with soluble agents to targeted tissue. The micro- needles are made of optically transparent hollow glass (~300 ?m in diameter), which can be individually guided by a neurosurgeon with a remote control system into the target position in the brain and visualized with MRI. We hypothesize that the arborizing catheter with additional photothermal activation will provide more broad volumetric distribution of infusates in brain tissue compared to a currently used reflux-preventing catheter. In this Project 2 of our P01 proposal, we will address three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will optimize and evaluate an arborizing catheter using co-localized, simultaneous photothermal activation for broad distribution of infusates in brain tissue (phantoms and explanted tissue). We will demonstrate significant increase in breadth of infusate dispersion in arborizing catheters with photothermal activation (> 7- fold) compared to a commercial catheter. In Aim 2, we will Integrate and evaluate a remote control system, CETCS, to enable catheter positioning and microneedle arborization, and control of light dosage and drug perfusion based on feedback from real-time MRI. We aim to demonstrate the integrated system (CETCS) can achieve greater infusion coverage of target volume with drug (> 20% tumor + 2 cm tumor margin coverage), compared to the coverage achieved with a fixed catheter. In Aim 3, we will evaluate drug distribution and efficacy by CETCS for treating spontaneous canine GBMs. We aim to show CETCS can broadly saturate tumor and margins (> 20% coverage) with QUAD-CTX+Gd-alb (a drug conjugate generated in Project 1) in canines with spontaneous GBM. Secondly, we aim to demonstrate tumor regression (> 50% decrease in sum product diameters) and improved Karnofsky Performance Scale scores (compared to base-line) in these patients. This novel approach to loco-regional delivery of treatment to brain tumors using CETCS will be tested using two types of innovative molecularly targeted anti-cancer agents generated in Project 1 of our P01. Moreover, it will be used to deliver engineered stem cells generated in Project 4 in order to permeabilize the BBB. We envision that our CETCS will greatly improve loco-regional deliveries of drugs resulting in better outcomes in patients with GBM."

Currently, she is an Assistant Professor with joint appointments in  the  Department  of  Materials  Science  and  Engineering  and  Department  of  Surgery  (Transplant  Surgery  division)  at  Northwestern  University.    Dr.  Shah's  past  research  had  mainly  focused  on  the  development  of  biomaterial  systems  for  musculoskeletal  regeneration,  and  she  is  now  venturing  into  a  new  area  of  liver  regeneration.    Although  her  regenerative  medicine  target  has  changed,  she  has  an  excellent  foundation  in  biomaterials  and  tissue  engineering  to  apply  what  she  has  learned  and  experienced  over  the  years  in  musculoskeletal tissue engineering to this new target area.  This award will give her the opportunity to receive  the  research  training,  institutional  support,  and  mentorship  she  needs  to  be  able  to  transition  into  an  independent investigator in the liver regeneration field.  Dr. Shah's mentors in this K01 proposal consist of well-established and recognized clinicians (Dr. Janardan  Reddy-Pathology  and  Dr.  Richard  Green-Hepatology)  in  the  hepatic  biology  field,  as  well  as  a  world- renowned researcher (Dr. Samuel Stupp-Materials Science and Engineering, Chemistry and Medicine) in the  field  of  self-assembly  and  nanomedicine.    She  has  their  full  support  in  helping  hr  develop  into  a  successful  independent  investigator  by  providing  valuable  input  on  research  design  and  methods,  troubleshooting,  scientific  direction,  and  guidance  in  the  preparation  of  manuscripts,  grants,  and  presentations.    Through  interactions  with  both  her  mentors  and  collaborators  she  will  be  able  to  develop  molecular  biology  and  biochemical assay techniques, as well as in vitro and in vivo evaluation methods to characterize the behavior  of hepatocytes, assess normal function, and understand the mechanisms behind cell-matrix interactions.  With  NU's strong research and training programs she will also have opportunities to interact with other faculty in the  engineering  and  medical  schools  who  share similar  research  interests  through  seminars,  conferences,  and  journal  clubs.    NU's  state of-the-art  research  facilities  and  technical  support  staff  will  also  help  Dr.  Shah  accomplish her proposed research aims.  Furthermore, through formal coursework offered by NU's Graduate  Program,  Dr.  Shah  will  be  able  to  increase  her  knowledge  in  basic  cell  and  molecular  biology  to  help  her  interpret her research results.  In addition, she has the opportunity to participate in seminars and conferences  within the Hepatology service in the medical school to increase her knowledge of clinical hepatology.  The proposed research aims to use multifunctional 3D bioprinted scaffolds incorporating bioactive agents  such  peptide  nanostructures  and  support  cells  to  enhance  the  viability  and  function  of  hepatocytes  fr  liver  tissue  engineering.    The  lack  of  liver  donors  for  patients  with  end  stage  liver disease  (ESLD)  is  a  major  healthcare  obstacle.    Developing  organ  replacements  or  functional  liver  units  using  tissue  engineering  strategies as an alternative treatment is a promising possibility to alleviate this significant need.  The interplay  between  microenvironmental  cues  and  cell  behavior  in  liver  tissue  engineering,  however,  is  still not  well  understood.  This research hopes to establish and understand trends in 3D scaffold design and bioactive agent  delivery  to  start  to  identify  key  components  in  the  microenvironment  that  can  enhance  liver  cell  function  and  normal  liver  tissue  formation  both  in  vitro  and  in  vivo.    The  hypothesis  is  that  the  viability  and  function  of  hepatocytes can be significantly enhanced by: 1) optimizing scaffold architecture, which can alter hepatocyte  aggregation and cell-cell contact~ 2) including functional moieties for growth factor delivery via self-assembling  peptide amphiphile (PA) nanofibers~ and 3) co-culturing stromal cells and hepatocytes with 3D spatial control.   Small  liver  units  will  be  created  using  3D  bioplotted  scaffolds  of  varying  pore  size  and  geometry,  peptide- based nanostructures and growth factors for bioactive signaling, and liver cells (primary hepatocytes, induced  pluripotent  stem  cell-derived  hepatocytes,  and  stromal  cells)  that  are  spatially  patterned  in  3D  to  change  microenvironmental  cues  and  determine  what  conditions  promote  optimal  hepatocyte  viability  and  function.  Materials characterization, in vitro evaluation of viability, proliferation, and function, as well as in vivo  assessment  of  angiogenesis,  scaffold  degradation,  and  tissue  synthesis  will  be  performed  to  evaluate  the  potential  of  these  multifunctional  scaffolds  for  liver  tissue  engineering.

A major reason for this stagnation in global TB control efforts is that the current approach consists largely of broad guidelines that are difficult to implement in high-burden communities. What we need is an approach that can help prioritize between feasible, targeted TB control interventions in a way that uses limited resources to maximize impact on disease burden and transmission at the community level. We propose to address this knowledge gap by constructing a detailed snapshot of prevalent TB in a high-burden community: identifying every detectable case of active TB (including those with subclinical TB or not seeking care), using whole-genome sequencing to detect transmission networks in the community, and characterizing every prevalent case in terms of what specific targeted interventions could diagnose and treat that case sooner. These data will enable us to estimate intervenable fractions ? the proportion of prevalent TB (and of TB transmission potential) that could have been captured at an earlier time point by each of an array of feasible, targeted interventions. We will combine these data with data on cost and efficiency (ability to capture people with TB versus controls without TB) to help identify what combinations of TB interventions have greatest potential to reduce TB prevalence at the community level for a given budgetary outlay. We will also construct an agent-based mathematical model to help project how these findings might pertain to other settings with different epidemiological and economic characteristics. This research will provide a critical evidence base for policy-makers seeking to prioritize TB interventions with greatest impact on population-level disease burden, and it will also inform what interventions should be prioritized in the next generation of clinical trials. In Specific Aim 1, we will not only estimate the prevalence of TB in a well-circumscribed urban Ugandan community, but also characterize that prevalence to a degree never before achieved at the population level ? including novel markers of infectiousness (e.g., cough frequency), transmission between cases that may not even have symptoms (in a second wave of case-finding), and cases' likelihood of being engaged by targeted interventions. In Specific Aim 2, we will estimate and compare the intervenable fraction of TB associated with numerous targeted interventions, thereby helping to prioritize those interventions in terms of their likely community-level impact. In Specific Aim 3, we will link these epidemiological priorities with cost-effectiveness analysis and agent-based simulation modeling, to guide priorities using constrained economic resources and to generalize such findings to a variety of epidemiological settings. This innovative approach will allow us to take an urgently-needed step, from simply measuring the burden of TB disease and offering ?one-size-fits-all? guidelines, to understanding how we can prioritize feasible, targeted interventions to effectively reduce that disease burden, one community at a time."
"9330421","ABSTRACT ? Administrative Core The purpose of this Collaborative Program is to bring together investigators focusing on a coordinated and synergistic strategy within the overarching goals of the Nonhuman Primate Transplantation Tolerance Cooperative Study Group (NHPCSG), including: (1) development of novel tolerance induction regimens; (2) evaluation of the preclinical safety and efficacy of existing and newly developed candidate immune tolerance induction regimens; (3) development and validation of biomarkers for the induction, maintenance and/or loss of immune tolerance or for the prediction of graft rejection; and (4) elucidation of the mechanisms underlying the induction, maintenance, and/or loss of tolerance in NHP allograft models of islet, kidney, heart, and/or lung transplantation. In order to coordinate our program's efforts to achieve these goals, we propose an Administrative Core to manage fiscal and other resources, facilitate interactions and communication, ensure timely progress toward program goals, and ensure adherence to NIH regulations regarding management of the grant."
"9410748","Project Summary The HIV-1 capsid, which encloses viral and host components essential for establishing infection, influences every post-entry step, including reverse transcription, nuclear entry and integration targeting. These capsid- mediated events are governed by HIV-1 uncoating, a process in which the conical core sheds viral capsid proteins (CA) and transforms into reverse transcription complexes and then pre-integration complexes. Uncoating of the viral capsid is regulated by both core stability and capsid-binding host cofactors. Much remains to be learned about how the uncoating process is coordinated to facilitate viral propagation. Temporal deviations from the normal course of capsid disassembly (delayed or accelerated uncoating) by antiviral factors or pharmacological manipulation can severely impair viral infectivity. However, it still remains unclear precisely how intrinsic core stability affects capsid disassembly and downstream events. Our preliminary studies have identified a natural HIV-1 strain that appears to alter core stability without compromising viral fitness. In Aim 1, we will characterize a broad range of biological properties of this unique variant and also exploit core-destabilizing activity of capsid-targeting antivirals as a tool to study capsid stability. Current models posit that core disassembly impacts innate sensing of HIV-1 DNA but mechanistic details have yet to be elucidated. In Aim 2, we propose to examine how perturbation of uncoating by manipulating core stability and capsid interactions with host proteins affects innate immune responses. Capsid uncoating also plays roles in nuclear events, such as nuclear import and integration targeting. In Aim 3, we will address how these events are functionally linked and contribute to optimal viral growth by using various experimental approaches, including novel high-throughput single-cell assays."

"9324843","Abstract: Molecular and Cellular Cancer Biology Program (MCCBP)  The goal of the Molecular and Cellular Cancer Biology Program (MCCBP), a basic research program, is to gain  new insight into the molecular and cellular basis of cancer development and progression that can eventually be  translated into the development of novel biomarkers of progression and treatment regimens. MCCBP research  activities fall under three central themes: 1) genome stability; 2) signal transduction; and 3) mitochondria and  metabolism. Specific aims of the MCCBP are to: 1) elucidate mechanisms of genome instability; 2) understand  aberrant signal transduction in tumor cells; 3) investigate bioenergetic alterations and loss of apoptotic  signaling in tumor cells; and 4) provide capacity building in support of the three research themes. Through  collaboration and communication with other UPCI programs and translational disease-site groups, novel  research findings by MCCBP investigators are translated into promising clinical applications, including the  development of new targeted therapies and identification and validation of biomarkers. During the last funding  cycle, the Program has lost 15 members but has added additional investigators and has grown by about 71%  from 39 to 55 actively participating members, representing 17 departments and three schools at the University  of Pittsburgh and one at Carnegie Mellon University. New members have been strategically added each year.  Currently, MCCBP members receive over $9.8 M annually in direct funding, including $4.1 M from the NCI and  $5.1 M in other peer-reviewed support. Between January 2010 and April 2014, MCCBP members have  authored 771 cancer-related publications, of which 25% resulted from intra-programmatic and 38% from inter-  programmatic collaborations. Approximately 42% of the papers represent collaborations with external  investigators. The overall aim of the Program is to make fundamental discoveries in cancer biology in the  key thematic areas. MCCBP leadership and members continue to achieve scientific impact through  successful translation of pre-clinical research findings to clinical problems through strategic interactions  with UPCI membership of other translational and clinical programs. UPCI support, including shared  resources, specifically the Animal Facility, Biostatistics Facility, Cancer Bioinformatics Services, Cancer  Genomics Facility, Cancer Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics Facility, Cancer Proteomics Facility, Cell  and Tissue Imaging Facility, Chemical Biology Facility, Cytometry Facility, Immunological Monitoring and  Cellular Products Laboratory, In Vivo Imaging Facility, and Tissue and Research Pathology Services facilitates  and enhances MCCBP research."
"9237719","PROJECT SUMMARY This project is a continuation and further development of a previous INIA project, which was based on studies showing ethanol-induced changes in brain neuroimmune gene expression in animal models and humans. Those data suggested that ethanol dysregulates proinflammatory, Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling in the brain. During the previous period of funding, we found that pharmacological or genetic manipulation of molecules that signal through the myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) alters ethanol intake and preference. The proposed renewal has three Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1 seeks to repurpose three existing FDA-approved drugs with proven anti-inflammatory activity: apremilast (a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor recently approved for treating psoriasis), sulfasalazine (an inhibitor of IKK? used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease), and gemfibrozil (a PPAR? activator used in the treatment of hyperlipidemia). These drugs will be tested for their effectiveness in reducing ethanol intake and altering other ethanol- dependent behaviors in mice. Specific Aim 2 will explore another branch of TLR inflammatory signaling that depends on signaling via the TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-? (TRIF) protein. This aim will examine the role of brain regional and cell-specific knockdown of TRIF-dependent signaling proteins on ethanol intake using lentiviral-mediated RNA interference in collaboration with the Lasek project. Specific Aim 3 serves a collaborative function to provide behavioral testing of new drugs and candidate genes for other INIA projects. The Mayfield project will analyze gene expression networks to predict drugs that will normalize the network, and we will test these drugs for their ability to reduce ethanol consumption in mice. The Hitzemann and Mayfield projects will elect candidate long non-coding RNAs based on transcriptome analyses of high drinking-in-the-dark (HDID) mouse lines and of rhesus macaques chronically exposed to ethanol (in collaboration with INIA-Stress) and human postmortem brain samples. The Homanics project will generate mutant mice for the candidate long non-coding RNAs, and we will perform behavioral testing with these mice. We will also continue to provide mutant mice for the Roberto project and provide Crh-Cre rats for the Pfefferbaum/Zahr project. We anticipate that other INIA projects will identify additional drugs or targets that require behavioral testing, which we will carry out as part of this collaborative function."
"9335421","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The resistin-like molecule (RELM) family of proteins comprises pleiotropic cytokines critically involved in the vascular remodeling and cardiac dysfunction seen in animal and human pulmonary arterial hypertension (PH). Our rodent and human work and the work of others strongly suggests that human resistin (hResistin) and human RELMß (hRELMß) are mechanistically important to the etiology of human PH and associated right ventricular dysfunction (RVD) and serve as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for this disease. IN the CADET I we accomplished target validation and developed a series of human antibodies against hResistin and against hRELMß including some that recognized both targets. The first aim (UH2) will identify an optimal lead antibody through biophysical and antigen-antibody interaction studies, antibody inhibition of target effects in cell based assays, and clinical efficacy studies of antibodies in our humanized overexpressing resistin and RELMß mouse models of PH. It will also include antibody affinity maturation and optimization as needed and initial GLP cell line selection and optimization. This aim will further assess the selectivity, functionality and drugability of our lead candidates. The second aim (UH3) will evaluate the in vivo pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of our lead candidate(s), perform toxicology, immunogenicity and bioavailability studies in animal models, further optimize cell production efficiency of the lead antibody, and manufacture and scale-up GMP production of the lead antibody(ies). It will include pre-formulation development and clinical formulation development. It will end with creation and filing of our IND application with the FDA. The third aim (UH2, UH3) will explore and develop the biomarker potential of human resistin and RELMß to assess severity and progression of PH and to predict response to therapy, by studying the functional role of genetic polymorphisms, PBMC gene expression, and serum levels for these proteins, and integrating and correlating these findings with the demographic, hemodynamic, clinical, genetic and genomic data already obtained in our recent SCCOR grant on pulmonary arterial hypertension, with a primary focus on PH and cardiac function."
"9323677","Project Summary /Abstract Neonates are highly susceptible to infection and respond poorly to vaccination for reasons that are not well understood. Based on our published data, we believe that neonates are particularly vulnerable to repeat infections because their naïve CD8+ T cells are intrinsically defective at differentiating into memory CD8+ T cells. A major goal of this grant is to identify the key gene regulatory networks that underlie cell-intrinsic differences between neonatal and adult CD8+ T cells. Since microRNAs (miRNAs) are developmentally regulated and required for CD8+ T cell function, we hypothesized that defective CD8+ T cell memory formation in early life may be due to differences in miRNA expression patterns between neonatal and adult CD8+ T cells. To test our hypothesis, we used next generation sequencing to identify mouse miRNAs that are differentially regulated in neonatal and adult CD8+ T cells throughout the response to infection. Surprisingly, our results indicated that differences in miRNA expression profiles were most pronounced prior to immunological challenge, suggesting that developmentally-regulated miRNAs do not operate by altering the fate of effector cells at the peak of the response. Instead, these miRNAs appear to set the activation threshold prior to infection, causing neonatal CD8+ T cells to differentiate more rapidly into effector cells and biasing them away from a memory precursor fate. We are particularly interested in two miRNAs (miR-29 and miR-130), which we believe play a major role in cell-intrinsic differences that exist between neonatal and adult CD8+ T cells in mice and humans. MiR-130 is preferentially expressed in neonatal CD8+ T cells and targets a number of genes involved in negative regulation of T cell proliferation or apoptosis. MiR-29, on the other hand, is more abundant in adult CD8+ T cells and regulates the expression of transcription factors involved in effector and memory cell differentiation. We propose that the miR-29/miR-130 axis acts as a developmental rheostat for adjusting the activation threshold of CD8+ T cells, controlling the balance between rapid effector cells (neonates) and long-lived memory cells (adults). The main objectives of this proposal are to determine how age-related changes in miR-29 and miR-130 expression alter the ability of CD8+ T cells to respond to infection (Aim 1); identify the key target genes regulated by miR- 29 and miR-130 prior to activation (Aim 2); and determine whether miR-29 and miR-130 can predict vaccine- specific CD8+ T cell responses in newborns (Aim 3). Accomplishing these aims will lend support for a new model describing how miRNAs regulate the CD8+ T cell response to infection, which can lead to novel therapeutic strategies for enhancing the development of memory CD8+ T cells in early life."
"9297305","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The explosion of biomedical big data (e.g. imaging, clinical records, and omic analyzes) that captures multiple levels of complexity has the potential to dramatically accelerate the translation of knowledge from bench to bedside. However, the effective use of these data requires skills in computer science, statistics, and bioinformatics, as well as detailed knowledge of biology and medicine to aid in the interpretation of the data analysis. Unfortunately, biomedical researchers are not trained in the computational and statistical methods needed to handle high-density biomedical big data. As a result, many biomedical scientists are frustrated by their inability to: (a) analyze big data, (b) utilize the valuable public resources containing big data, and (c) effectively communicate with computer scientists, statisticians and bioinformaticians. These barriers have significantly hampered the translational application of the large body of big data that has accumulated thus far. In order to overcome these challenges, this team proposes to create a summer training course that is built upon case studies and that is specifically designed for biomedical researchers who are novices in big data analysis. The investigators identified the need for this course in a survey of administrators and researchers at Midwest and Big Ten universities. This course will raise knowledge of the potential uses of biomedical big data and will develop skills for locating, accessing, managing, visualizing, analyzing, and integrating various types of big data that are publicly available. The proposed big data training program has three goals: (1) introduce the fundamental concepts of big data in biomedical research to raise awareness of the value of this research approach, (2) provide face-to-face instruction that develops the technical competency needed for big data science, and (3) develop educational and data analysis resources using the HUBzero platform to aid our face-to-face instruction and provide post-instruction opportunities for reinforcing and expanding technical skills. The course will exploit available big data resources and tools so that biologists can productively explore big data within a short time. The educational program will target graduate students, postdoctoral trainees, physician-scientists and biomedical scientists, with strong biomedical backgrounds but who have limited advanced coursework in statistics, bioinformatics, and computer science. This course will be centered at Purdue University, a large public university with recognized strengths in statistics and computer science, with a goal to serve scientists in the Midwest area. Also, the HUBzero platform, a unique technology developed at Purdue, will be used to house computational tools and deliver the educational program, and to lower the technical barriers that challenge participants. This approach will complement the classical curricula in biomedical training programs and serve as a foundation for more advanced training. The proposed course is directly responsive to RFA-HG-14-008 because it will enable biomedical researchers to more confidently explore existing biomedical big data, implement their own data collection and analysis plans, and communicate within research teams."
"9366937","Project Summary The Zika virus (ZIKV) causes severe birth defects such as microcephaly. The WHO has declared the Zika virus disease as a global public health emergency. However, developing safe and efficient preventive and therapeutic vaccines for it may take many years and is very expensive. Here, we propose to develop a novel platform called ?chemical intravenous- immunoglobulins? (CIVIG) for rapid generation of therapeutic/prophylactic antisera against ZIKV. In the CIVIG platform, we will introduce high-affinity and high-specificity ligands against the virus to the native immunoglobulins isolated from normal donors, converting them into microbe- specific antisera. This revolutionary platform is based on our recently published method to site- specifically ligate the microbe capturing ligands to the indole binding site (IBS) at Fab region of clinical grade intravenous-immunoglobulins (IVIG). The resulting ligand-decorated polyclonal antiserum is expected to bind to and neutralize the causative microbial agent. In this project, high-affinity and high-specificity ligands against ZIKV envelope protein and intact Zika virions will be discovered and optimized via the enabling one-bead-one-compound (OBOC) combinatorial chemical library technology. The ligands identified will be evaluated for cross- reactivity with other related flaviviruses (e.g., Dengue virus). Such ligands will be site-specifically ligated to the Fab region of IVIG with IBS-affinity element, via proximity ligation, to form CIVIG. The binding affinity and specificity of the CIVIGs to Zika virion will be determined with surface plasmon resonance (SPR). In vitro neutralizing effects of CIVIGs will be tested in Vero cells and primary human skin cells (e.g. normal human fibroblasts). Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of virus infection and cytotoxicity will also be tested using cell-based established protocols prior to in vivo testing of CIVIG. The proposed platform is highly versatile, efficient, economical, and the time it takes from ligand discovery to scale up production of neutralizing antisera can be as short as three months. This general platform technology can be further applied for other emerging infectious diseases and modified for screenings using non-infectious virus-like particle and/or purified viral envelope proteins."
"9332136","Project Summary/Abstract High school graduation is among the strongest empirical predictors of healthy trajectories for adolescents, predicting education attainment1,2, career outcomes3-5, and justice system involvement6. For diverse, low-income youth, cumulative risk exposure interferes with academic success in high school, and resources are insufficient to mitigate these risks. Academic success is strongly influenced by self-concept7,8, and threats to self-concept can have a significant and lasting impact on performance. Previous research has shown that brief, theoretically precise ?wise? interventions can positively impact self-concept, and subsequent student outcomes8. For the past year we have partnered with Hialeah-Miami Lakes High School to develop a school mental health model with components at both universal (self-guided writing intervention to influence self-concept) and targeted (peer mentoring around self-concept, goal setting and problem solving) levels. We will examine the universal component that utilizes non-academic self-concept (each student?s self-selected strengths and values) as a potential lever for change. Specifically, we will refine and deliver (via within-classrooms, randomized controlled design) a brief, resource-minimal, self-concept intervention designed to improve academic outcomes for vulnerable adolescents (Research Aim 1), and we will examine impact of the intervention via intent-to-treat analyses and test a detailed model of causal risk factors via mediation and moderation (Research Aim 2). Incoming 9th grade high school students (n = 205; 72% Latino, 23% African American, 80% low-income), will complete a brief, self-guided writing intervention during class time, in ten minute increments, once per week, over the first six weeks of school. Latent growth curve analyses will examine impact on academic success, as measured by global GPA, at the end of each academic quarter (Hypothesis #1). Structural equation modeling will examine reduced mental health symptoms and improved academic self-concept as mechanisms of change (Hypothesis #2). Dr. Geoffrey Cohen will consult on wise interventions for academic success (Training Goal #1). Dr. Stefany Coxe will consult on developing advanced quantitative skills for longitudinal, clustered data analysis. Findings will inform design and examination of a multi-level school mental health model for self-concept intervention at universal, targeted and indicated levels via a post-doctoral NRSA application. The proposed training goals and research aims will prepare me for a career as an independent investigator focused on healthy trajectories through academic success for vulnerable youth, focusing on resource-minimal, wise intervention tools that are feasible, effective, and sustainable."
"9320759","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Long Life Family Study (LLFS), established in 2005 in response to an NIA RFA, enrolled families enriched for exceptional longevity (EL), to discover factors that contribute to healthy aging and survival. From 2006 to 2009, LLFS enrolled 539 sibships (G1), their offspring (G2) and spouses (total 4,953). Comparison with a referent cohort reveals that LLFS families have strong exceptional clustering of EL. The G2 offspring have a variety of Healthy Aging Phenotypes (HAPs), defined as an unusually low age-specific prevalence of one or more specific conditions or risk factors, compared to population-based cohorts suggesting enrichment of shared (possibly genetic) protective effects in LLFS families. In the second funding period (2010-2013), we conducted a 2.5 million SNP GWAS (dbGaP phs000397); developed a high-throughput technique and sequenced ~450 candidate genes and replicated many variants and found additional ones associated with Healthy Aging Phenotypes (HAP) and longevity. 54% of LLFS G1 and 92% of G2 remain alive. Participant retention has been 94%. We now propose a third funding period to conduct a second in-person examination (V2) to prospectively study rates of change in HAPs with age and identify genetic and other factors contributing to HAPs and longevity. We hypothesize that EL and HAPs entail common and rare variants that individually have modest effects, but which in combinations strongly influence longevity and specific HAPs, and may only be detectable in family studies enriched for HAPs, such as LLFS. HAPs evaluated at the initial in-person visit show strong linkage peaks which are not explained by common haplotypes interrogated by GWAS (HLODs ranging from 6.0-45.1). These are likely driven by rare, lineage-private alleles that will only be found by sequencing specific families, and may point to important new biology. Specific Aim 1 is to conduct a second in-home examination on all surviving LLFS participants. Specific Aim 2 is to analyze cross-sectional and longitudinal phenotypes. The goal is to identify pathways for EL and HAPs by characterizing the shared and distinct LLFS phenotypes and environmental factors. We will characterize individual longitudinal patterns of HAPs to identify subgroups showing similar patterns and exceptional phenotypes. We will test whether these HAPs are heritable, and test for differences with internal and external referent groups. Specific Aim 3 is to find genes/variants associated with cross-sectional and longitudinal phenotypes using a) Whole Exome Sequencing to comprehensively search for coding variants associated with HAPs and EL and b) Targeted Regulatory Sequencing of regions under linkage peaks for HAPs in selected families showing the strongest linkage evidence. Specific Aim 4 is to replicate our genetic and epidemiological findings in other aging study cohorts. This study could lead to the discovery of pathways and potential therapeutic/prevention targets affecting HAPs and EL. A Data Management and Coordinating Center and 4 Field Centers comprise the major components of the LLFS. This renewal application is submitted by the Duke Uni./Uni. of Southern Denmark Field Center."

"9283075","Patients with glioblastoma (GBM) have a dismal prognosis. We found that over 90% of patients with GBM over-express both interleukin 13 receptor alpha 2 (IL-13RA2) and EphA2 receptor that are absent in normal brain. More recently, we have demonstrated that the EphA3 receptor is also over-expressed in GBM, and its pattern of expression differs from that of EphA2. IL-13RA2, EphA2, and EphA3 are present in various compartments of GBM tumors. All three receptors are expressed in tumor cells of the core of tumor and in locally-infiltrating tumor cells, while EphA2 is also over-expressed in tumor neovasculature. Further, IL-13RA2, EphA2, and EphA3 are associated with, and play crucial roles in, the pathobiology of glioma stem-like cells (GSC). IL-13RA2 contributes to GSC properties and EphA2 and EphA3 both drive their self-renewal and tumorigenicity. Finally, the EphA3 receptor can be readily detected in GBM-infiltrating cells of monocytic origin, tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). Thus, collectively, IL-13RA2, EphA2, and EphA3 are expressed in principal GBM compartments shown to be involved in tumor progression and/or resistance to therapies. One of the Eph receptor ligands, ephrinA5 (eA5), binds EphA2 and EphA3 and also uniquely the EphB2 receptor; the latter also is expressed specifically on GBM cells. In the current project, we will pursue the novel idea of targeting all four receptors with one pharmaceutical compound. This bi-valent compound will recognize IL- 13RA2, EphA2, EphA3, and EphB2 and deliver a drug to GBM tumors, specifically killing tumor cells and cells of the tumor environment promoting its growth. We have also isolated a small peptide, Pep-1L, which specifically recognizes IL-13RA2, induces receptor's internalization and it is bound by intracranial tumors in mice. These and other properties make the peptide a desirable vehicle to augment access of drugs/labels to tumors. We will continue this exciting line of research through two Specific Aims. In the first Aim, we will produce a potent bi-valent cytotoxin, QUAD-CTX, simultaneously targeting the IL-13RA2, EphA2, EphA3, and EphB2 receptors. We will generate a chemical conjugate with a modified chemotherapeutic which can pass the blood-brain barrier (BBB) on its own, termed WP1244. The drug conjugate will be tested in in vitro models of various compartments of GBM and in vivo. In the second Aim, we will exploit a peptide binding to IL-13RA2 for effective targeted systemic or loco-regional chemotherapy, for monitoring of the disruption of the BBB and responses to treatment. We will exploit internalized peptide Pep-1L, which homes to intracranial tumors, for conjugation to WP1244 (Pep-1L-CTX) and test it in GBM models expressing IL-13RA2 to verify the conjugate's ability to penetrate the BBB and/or blood-brain tumor barrier. We will also generate imaging probes based on the peptide. We expect that this comprehensive assault on GBM will translate into clear-cut durable responses in patients."
"9383787","Project Abstract: Successful in vitro hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) expansion would be therapeutically invaluable in transplant- based therapies, but it has proven to be a formidable challenge, owing in part to our limited understanding of how HSCs expand in vivo. The complicated origins and migratory development of fetal HSCs have made this difficult task even more daunting. The fetal liver is an important developmental site of physiological HSC expansion, however the molecular mechanisms that drive the proliferation of these stem cells in the fetal liver are not understood. In recent studies, we have investigated the role of Notch signaling during fetal development using a knock-in mouse model lacking the transcriptional activation domain of Notch1 (DTAD). We have discovered a requirement for Notch1 in the viability of HSCs during fetal liver expansion and a novel role for Notch signaling in fetal HSCs following transplantation in a recipient. In this Research Project Grant, we will build on these findings by carrying out in depth investigation of Notch signaling in fetal HSCs and in the fetal microenvironment. In Aim1, we will elucidate the molecular mechanism of the Notch signaling apparatus in the fetal liver HSCs. We predict that a combination of specific protein interactions and unique transcriptional targets direct the cell fate decisions of fetal HSCs and that their interactions and targets differ from adult bone marrow HSCs. By relying on the Notch1DTAD mutant, and generating a conditional Notch1DTAD mouse model, we will identify the tissue specific Notch transcriptional machinery essential for survival in the fetal liver and for the reconstitutive potential of HSCs. In Aim 2, we will investigate the fetal liver microenvironment that provides the framework for tissue specific expansion of fetal HSCs. We will examine various population of fetal liver cells and test them for the surface expression of Notch ligands. Endothelial cells (FL ECs) express high levels of Notch ligands Jagged1 and Dll4, thus we will determine their role in the activation of Notch signaling in the fetal liver. We will use in vivo transgenic animal models and an in vitro co-culture system to test the expansion of HSCs through the use of Notch-ligand presenting FL ECs and the integration of the Notch co-culture system with other established signaling pathways. The knowledge gained from these aims will enhance our understanding of how signaling pathways drive stem cell maintenance, expansion as well function in a transplantation setting. Uncovering the signaling cues by which HSCs expand without exhausting their self- renewal capacity is of immense therapeutic importance in overcoming both blood disorders related to aging and disease."
"9448125","KCNQ2/3 channels have emerged as essential regulators of neonatal brain excitability, highlighted by the several loss- and gain-of-function KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 variants that have been identified in patients with neonatal and infantile epileptic encephalopathy. Therefore, an improved understanding of the function of neuronal KCNQ2/3 channels in the brain is paramount for developing new therapeutics for neonatal epilepsy. Over the last several years, we have made progress in determining the differential roles of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 channels in controlling pyramidal neuron excitability and in mediating multiple membrane conductances. Here we propose experiments to tackle important outstanding questions regarding the function and properties of KCNQ2/3 potassium channels in interneurons. Interneurons are critical for shaping the activity of neuronal populations and promoting the development of excitatory synaptic circuits. KCNQ2/3 channels are expressed early in development when interneurons have not yet fully developed their clade of unique potassium channels, raising the possibility that KCNQ2/3 channels might control interneuron properties at early developmental stages. One explanation is that a decrease in interneuron excitability leads to the hyperexcitability phenotype of the gain-of-function KCNQ2/3 variants in epileptic encephalopathy. Thus, elucidating the role of KCNQ2/3 channels in interneuron excitability and exploring the effects of known gain-of-function KCNQ2/3 variants will shed new insights into cortical physiology in health and disease. To this end, we will: (i) determine the function of KCNQ2/3 channels in immature parvalbumin (PV)- and somatostatin (SST)-positive interneurons using cell-type specific genetics, (ii) determine whether Kcnq2/3 ablation from interneurons leads to network excitability ex vivo and in vivo, and (iii) determine whether gain-of-function KCNQ2/3 variants lead to interneuron hypoexcitability and subsequent excitatory network hyperexcitability. The proposed research will significantly contribute to our broader understanding of how KCNQ2/3 channels control neuronal excitability, building a foundation for the prevention and treatment of neurological disorders such as pediatric epilepsy."
"9292389","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Convergent laboratory, epidemiological and clinical observations have identified urate - the end product of purine metabolism in humans - as a neuroprotectant and the first molecular predictor of both reduced risk and slower progression of typical Parkinson's disease (PD). Urate is also a potent antioxidant and confers protection in cellular and animal models of PD. Epidemiological studies of prospectively followed healthy populations have repeatedly demonstrated serum urate to be an inverse risk factor for PD. These findings led to the discovery that among people with early PD serum and CSF urate levels are predictors of slower progression, assessed clinically or by neuroimaging of dopamine transporter (DAT) loss over years. Phase 2 Progress: Based on urate's properties as a neuroprotectant and favorable prognostic biomarker in PD, urate elevation was proposed as a candidate disease-modifying strategy. Inosine, an orally bioavailable precursor of urate, was investigated in a phase 2 study, the Safety of Urate Elevation in Parkinson's Disease (SURE-PD) trial. It demonstrated that inosine can safely produce well-tolerated elevations of serum and CSF urate for months or years in early PD. Secondary analyses of long-term clinical data support advancing to a pivotal efficacy trial. Results also suggested refinements in dosing and other design features. Phase 3 Aims: The primary aim of the study is to determine whether oral inosine dosed to persistently elevate serum urate (from =5.7 mg/dL to 7.1-8.0 mg/dL) slows clinical progression over two years in early PD. Secondary aims include assessing long-term safety and effects on a) the development of disability warranting dopaminergic medication, b) short-term changes in parkinsonian symptoms, c) changes in functional disability and quality of life, and d) non-motor measures of cognition, mood and autonomic function. The operational aim of the Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) is to safely, effectively and efficiently manage all study activities and training of ~60 participating Parkinson Study Group (PSG) clinical sites and to integrate clinical management by the CCC with data and drug management by the partnered Data Coordinating Center (DCC). Methods: A placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized trial of inosine will enroll 270 subjects with early PD, lower serum urate and DAT deficiency by neuroimaging and will randomize them 1:1 to treatment with placebo or inosine dosed to elevate urate for 2 years with a 3-month wash-out. Our primary outcome of change in the Movement Disorders Society Unified PD Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) total score will be assessed quarterly to measure patient- and investigator-reported and motor and non-motor features of the disease. Significance: Slowing the progressive clinical decline of PD remains a critical unmet goal of neurotherapeutics development. If the established association between higher urate and favorable outcomes in PD patients are due to neuroprotective properties, then this study is designed to provide direct evidence that urate-elevating inosine treatment slows clinical progression of the disease."
"9329470","Project Summary This application proposes a rigorous multidisciplinary institutional training program in emergency care research (ECR) that will prepare clinician-scientists for independent research careers in emergency care. The field of emergency care will be advanced through this highly-trained scientific workforce and the collaborative relationships built during their training, ultimately improving the quality of emergency care and patient outcomes. The training program draws upon a well-established, multidisciplinary team of 47 mentors from 22 unique Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) schools, departments, divisions, institutes and centers. The program is built on a unique partnership between the OHSU Department of Emergency Medicine and OHSU's Clinical and Translational Science Award program (the Oregon Clinical and Translational Research Institute) and further enhanced by the collaborative support of the OHSU School of Medicine, School of Nursing, School of Public Health and College of Pharmacy. These unique collaborations and partnerships will provide scholars with a broad array of mentors, didactic coursework and research resources. The primary aim is to produce highly trained clinician-scientists in emergency care across a diverse range of scientific disciplines. Each scholar will have a tailored Research and Career Development Plan, including a didactic program, mentored research experience and faculty development plan. By the end of the training period, each scholar will have expertise in research methodology, conducting ECR and the skills required for success as an independent investigator and research leader. The Specific Aims of the Oregon Emergency Care Research Multidisciplinary Training Program are: 1. To train the next generation of multidisciplinary clinician-scientists in the art and science of ECR; 2.

"9320322","Project Summary The Facilitating the use of Cross-National Equivalent File (CNEF) Data will support, enhance, and expand the Cross-National Equivalent Files (CNEF). The CNEF is a compendium of panel data from eight countries. It is a cooperative effort of individuals and institutions that, as of 2016, compiles panel survey data from eight countries that include the US Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), UK British Household Panel Study (BHPS), Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey (HILDA), Korea Labor and Income Panel (KLIPS), Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Study-Higher School of Economics (RLMS-HSE), Canadian Survey of Labor and Income Dynamics (SLID), German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), and Swiss Household Panel (SHP). The CNEF harmonizes data common to two or more of the country- based surveys, allows researchers access to both the harmonized and original data, provides all harmonization algorithms, and focuses on some of the most successful nationally representative ongoing longitudinal micro-data sets in the world. Researchers around the world use CNEF data to study social science questions in a cross- country comparative framework. They study questions that are scientifically important and relevant to current policy debates. CNEF value as a rich resource for such studies is likely to grow as people, economies, and governments become ever more inter-connected. The CNEF data are resources the research community uses to produce new knowledge, deeper understanding and better evidence to guide policy-makers as they adapt policies to new social and economic realities. Interest in cross-national comparative research is deep and widespread. A simple GoogleScholar search for the phrases cross-national or cross national yields more than 1,740,000 hits, many of which consist of articles in scholarly publications on a wide range of topics that includes cross-national comparisons of academic organizations, major depression, bipolar disorder, economic growth, earnings, income inequality, political participation, prostate cancer mortality, and patent rights. This project will update CNEF with new data releases and will develop documentation and dissemination tools that will increase the use of the data and make it easier for both the scientific, policy, and general public communities to share in and find out about the results of research using CNEF data."
"9408577","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The extensive outbreak of Zika and its devastating impact on infants exposed in utero have left many vulnerable families facing the long-term implications of raising a child with potentially severe and limiting disabilities. Although there has been international focus on the Zika outbreak, an urgent need for longitudinal surveillance of affected infants and families remains. Through a partnership between researchers at RTI International and the Altino Ventura Foundation (FAV), we have an unprecedented opportunity to study the natural history of congenital Zika syndrome (CZS), long-term sequela, and factors associated with child and family outcomes. We will enroll 240 infants with CZS and their families in a comprehensive, longitudinal study of early childhood development, health, functional abilities, and family adaptation. This study has the potential to increase knowledge about the short- and long-term needs of these families; promote collaborative efforts to support families; and improve understanding of the prognosis, mediators/moderators, and treatment possibilities for individuals affected by CZS. Further, we will use the study as a platform to train investigators at FAV and build capacity for collaborative research beyond the initial funding period."
"9220271","Project Abstract Millions of individuals across the United States lack stable housing, including the more than 2 million who become homeless each year. Policy solutions generally oscillate between treatment and prevention. The goal of this study is to evaluate the impact of temporary financial assistance for those at risk of homelessness on health outcomes and healthcare utilization. This study will exploit the quasi-random variation in the allocation of temporary financial assistance at one of the nation's largest call centers?the Homelessness Prevention Call Center (HPCC) in Chicago?to determine how this assistance impacts these outcomes. Based on preliminary results, temporary financial assistance significantly decreases the incidence of homeless shelter entry. Knowing this, the PIs now will extend this analysis to examine the impact of financial assistance on health outcomes for this vulnerable population. The PIs will test the hypothesis that those receiving temporary financial assistance are less likely to visit the emergency department or be admitted to the hospital. This project is the first quasi-experimental study to examine the impact of homelessness prevention on health outcomes and healthcare utilization. While the gold standard in impact evaluation is a randomized controlled trial study, in homelessness policy this is challenging for researchers because the population being served is both extremely vulnerable and highly mobile. These factors make keeping track of recipients of programming difficult and costly. Consequently, there is only limited information about the impact of homelessness prevention programs. Thus, this study fills an important gap in the literature on the effect of homelessness prevention programs. This study is possible because of the unique way in which the HPCC connects eligible callers with financial assistance, and because of information on health outcomes available through administrative data that can be linked to call center data. This study will be informative not only to scholars who study prevention programs, but also to policymakers and program managers who struggle to decide how best to distribute limited resources among prevention and treatment services to address the issue of homelessness. These policy decisions are typically not guided by evidence, because information on the effect of these options is so limited. Currently call centers like the HPCC are accessible by more than 90% of the US Population, including parts of all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. Together these centers process more than 15 million calls each year. Thus, the findings of this study will be transformative for policymaking and programming in this area, potentially affecting millions of people. This study will allow policymakers to make more informed choices when allocating limited resources to reduce homelessness, putting resources towards the most effective programs. In addition, this study will examine how this prevention service impacts different types of recipients, so the results will importantly inform service providers who run these call centers. Providers can make more informed choices, targeting emergency funding to those most likely to benefit from them. Importantly, this study will improve research and policy understanding of the impact of homelessness prevention on the health outcomes and healthcare utilization of this at risk population."
"9370434","PROJECT SUMMARY ? Improving care after cardiac arrest by informing surrogate decision makers Survival and neurological recovery after cardiac arrest are highly variable, driven in part by inconsistent hospital care following successful resuscitation. Significant variability in delivery of evidence based, guideline concordant care has been associated with differences in overall outcome from cardiac arrest. When guidelines are followed, survival with good neurologic recovery is improved. However, adherence to guidelines regarding delayed decision to withdraw life support has been highly variable across US hospitals. Reasons attributed to early withdrawal of life sustaining therapy include poor knowledge of national and international guidelines, requests from family for early outcome predications, and incomplete family comprehension of critical care. In order to encourage utilization of guideline concordant delayed neuro-prognostication and concomitant withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy (>72 hours after resuscitation) we propose a novel approach; to educate and inform surrogate decision makers on neuro-prognostic uncertainty and guideline concordant care. The research proposed in this career development award is intended to create a novel intervention that will encourage improved guideline adherence on neuro-prognostication and delayed WLST as well as to support the continued development of Dr. Sarah Perman, an early investigator committed to improving outcomes from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Aim 1 will utilize qualitative methodology to interview key stakeholders in decision making for comatose post-cardiac arrest patients (physicians, nurses, surrogate decision makers) to identify knowledge gaps and determine barriers to guideline concordant post-cardiac arrest care. Aim 2 will allow us to develop and refine educational tools to address neuro-prognostic uncertainty and guideline concordant post-arrest care. Utilizing a panel of cardiac arrest experts and stakeholder focus groups we will perform an iterative process to refine the tools and address potential barriers to implementation. Finally, in Aim 3 we will pilot test our educational tools in an equivalent time-samples quasi-experiment where we implement the tools in the University of Colorado Hospital Emergency Department for surrogate decision makers of resuscitated out of hospital cardiac arrest patients to explore feasibility and acceptability for widespread implementation. The results of the pilot trial will further inform the design of a multi-center pragmatic clinical trial to implement the educational tool in order to encourage guideline concordant post-cardiac arrest care including delayed neuro-prognostication and delayed withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy. Overall, we hypothesize that informing surrogate decision makers on guideline concordant care, will result in delayed decisions to withdraw life-sustaining therapy and allow the post-arrest patient adequate timing for appropriate neuro-prognostication and awakening, thus improving outcomes from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. This will be the subject of a future R01 proposal by the applicant."
"9358311","Summary This Project is directed toward the induction of xenotransplantation tolerance through mixed hematopoietic chimerism, which is to date the only treatment regimen that has been successful in translating allogeneic tolerance induction from animal models to the clinic. Prior to the current project period, attempts to achieve mixed chimerism across the pig-to-primate barrier had failed due to rapid clearance of infused porcine cells from the circulation of primates. During this period, we have tested the hypothesis that this rapid clearance might be due to the absence of the primate analog of the species-specific cell-membrane protein CD47 on the surface of porcine cells leading to rapid clearance of pig cells (PBSC) by recipient macrophages. We have produced and tested mobilized peripheral blood stem cells from human CD47 (hCD47) transgenic GalT-KO miniature swine for their ability to induce chimerism in baboons. Our results demonstrated markedly increased survival of porcine cells injected into baboons that was dependent on the level of hCD47 expression on donor cells. Furthermore, recipients of hCD47-expressing swine PBSC demonstrated prolonged survival of donor swine skin xenografts in the absence of immunosuppression. In the current proposal, we will attempt to increase the level and duration of porcine mixed chimerism by: 1) Confirming the effect of high expression of the hCD47 transgene in porcine hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and the use of intra-bone HSC inoculation on the establishment of chimerism and prolonged pig skin graft survival in baboons; 2) Testing the effect of ex-vivo expanded recipient Tregs on enhancement of xenogeneic chimerism and engraftment of hCD47/GalT-KO HSC; and 3) Testing the effect of new transgenes in genetically engineered swine, produced in Project 4, that are designed to increase the level and duration of donor chimerism and induce tolerance to skin grafts. In addition to advancing our goal toward the induction of xenograft tolerance, the experiments planned will provide basic information on xenogeneic stem cell engraftment and on the immunologic pathways responsible for xenogeneic rejection and tolerance induction in primates. These studies should therefore have both theoretical and practical implications for the eventual application of xenotransplantation as a clinical modality."
"9386264","Alzheimer disease (AD) is a heterogeneous and complex disorder and both genetic and environmental factors are likely to be involved in its etiology. Hundreds of putative susceptibility genes for late-onset AD have been reported, but the majority of these claims?with the exception of the e4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene? have not been consistently replicated. Furthermore, the functional significance of the majority of the positional candidate genes in AD pathogenesis is not clear. One putative environmental (viral) factor that has been implicated is human cytomegalovirus (CMV). Recent studies have established that CMV infection is associated with an increased risk of AD, and that several immunological and virological features of CMV infection correlate with clinical and pathological measures of this disease. It is clear, however, that not all equally exposed people are equally likely to develop CMV-spurred AD, suggesting the involvement of host genetic factors that could modify immunity to this virus. CMV has evolved a large repertoire of immunoevasion strategies. One strategy involves generating proteins that have functional properties of the Fc? receptor (Fc?R), which may enable the virus to evade host immunosurveillance by evading the effector consequences of anti-CMV antibody binding, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. We have shown that alleles of a major gene complex of the immune system?GM (? marker) allotypes?modulate this viral strategy. We have also shown that particular GM genotypes contribute to the magnitude of antibody responsiveness to CMV glycoprotein B (gB), which is conserved in herpesviruses because of its important role in infectivity, viral attachment and entry. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that GM genes are effect modifiers of CMV-AD association, and the underlying mechanisms include their contribution to anti-CMV immunity and their modulating influence on the viral immunoevasion strategies. The following specific aims will test our hypothesis: 1) Determine if GM alleles modulate the AD risk associated with CMV infection: DNA from 3 large longitudinal aging cohorts?most of which have been characterized for anti-CMV antibodies?will be genotyped for several GM alleles. We will determine whether GM alleles are risk factors for AD, influence anti-CMV antibody responsiveness, and thus act as effect modifiers of CMV-AD association; 2) Determine if CMV-encoded Fc?R proteins bind differentially to genetically disparate Fc? (GM) regions of anti-CMV IgG antibodies in AD patients: DNA encoding the ectodomains of TRL11/IRL11, RL-13, and UL119-UL118 Fc?Rs will be cloned and expressed in mammalian cells by standard methods. Using IgG subclass-specific affinity chromatography and sera from AD patients, we will purify IgG antibodies directed against CMV gB. Comparative affinities of allotypically disparate IgG molecules to the CMV Fc?Rs will be monitored by surface plasmon resonance. This proposal opens a new avenue of investigation towards our understanding of the host immunogenetic factors involved in the etiopathogenesis of AD. Results from this investigation could lead to novel immunotherapies against AD."
"9383148","The proposed project aims to design and field two more waves of survey data collection in Mexico, extending and improving the Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS). This is a national, multi-purpose, community-based, longitudinal cohort study of adults aged 50 and older. The two new waves will be fielded in 2018 and 2021, completing a cycle of 20 years since the first wave was fielded in 2001. Funds are also sought to continue to archive, document, and disseminate for public use the new waves as well as the resulting integrated data base containing all six waves. Since its inception, MHAS aimed to create a longitudinal prospective study of Mexican aging, starting with a national sample (n=15,000), using study protocols and survey instruments that were highly comparable to the U.S. Health and Retirement Study. In addition, the study design sought to facilitate the examination of long term implications for health and aging of the massive Mexico-U.S. migration flows. Thus, the sample design included an over-sample in states of Mexico with historically high levels of migration to the United States. The new waves will replicate and improve these and other unique features of previous rounds. New emphasis areas will be: environmental health; life histories; health literacy; evaluation of losses and deaths in the panel. We will also continue an emphasis on the culture of multi-generational Mexico-U.S. migration and its consequences for aging; and the impact for older adults of structural changes in Mexico such as the health sector reform that started in 2003 and the economic recession of 2009. Our aims are: 1) To carry out Waves 5 and 6 retaining the original substance of MHAS and adding new content, following the survivors of Waves 1 through 4, and refreshing the sample in Wave 5 to yield again a representative cross section of the Mexican population aged 50 and over; and 2) To enhance data linkages, data distribution, dissemination, and outreach activities and to expand knowledge about and use of the data sets and products of the resulting six waves of the MHAS. We will continue the user-friendly web-based platforms and educational materials whose enhanced public access to the data and project documentation have stimulated cross-country and other studies.  The analytical significance of the new MHAS data will be exceptional, producing a national longitudinal study of aging that span over twenty years, which is unique for a developing country. The data platform will enhance research on aging and related population changes: of physical and mental health, physical and cognitive functionality, environmental risks, health behaviors and health care use, family support, aging and the life course, wealth, income, labor and retirement, migration and old age, and mortality, in a developing country aging fast with limited institutional support for individuals in old age, and with close social and economic ties to the United States. The data will enable cross-period and cross-cohort analyses of health and aging, and will continue to be highly comparable with other similar studies in developed and developing countries, enhancing the study of aging and health with a cross-national perspective."
"9302820","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Very little is known about the developmental regulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters (together called drug-processing genes [DPGs]) in liver, placing newborns and children at a much higher risk of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Using RNA-Seq, we have shown that drug metabolism is the top most differentially regulated pathway in the entire liver transcriptome of germ-free (GF) mice, suggesting that there is a novel interaction between gut microbiome and hepatic DPGs. One of the key functions of gut microbiome is to produce secondary bile acids (BAs), which can activate two most critical xenobiotic-sensing nuclear receptors in liver, namely the pregnane X receptor (PXR) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR). During development, profound changes occur in the intestinal bacteria and the secondary BA profiles, suggesting that gut microbiome may at least in part contribute to the developmental regulation of DPGs in liver. No systematic studies have been performed to characterize the regulation of all DPGs by gut microbiome during development, and little is known regarding how targeting the gut microbiome by antibiotics or probiotics re- programs the ontogeny of DPGs in liver. Therefore the goal of this research is to utilize multidisciplinary approaches, including GF and genetically-engineered mice, BA metabolomics, Next-Generation Sequencing, and human fecal samples, to unveil the role of gut microbiota in modulating PXR and CAR signaling and the subsequent ontogenic re-programming of DPGs in liver. Our central hypothesis is: the developmental changes in the gut microbiome at least in part contribute to the regulation of the ontogeny of DPGs in liver, through altering secondary BAs in the gut to modify the PXR and/or CAR signaling in liver. We will test our hypothesis in 2 Aims: Aim 1A will use RNA-Seq to quantify mRNAs of 281 critical DPGs in livers of GF and conventional (Conv) mice at 6 developmental ages, and validate the proteins and activities of differentially regulated DPGs. We will also use ChIP-Seq to quantify how gut bacteria modulate PXR/CAR DNA binding to certain DPGs, and correlate DPG ontogeny with the ontogeny of gut microbiome (metagenomics) and BA profiles (UPLC-MS/MS). Aim 1B will introduce secondary BAs to GF mice in various PXR- and CAR-knockout and humanized transgenic) at various ages to test our hypothesis that secondary BAs restore the normal ontogeny of certain DPGs. Aim 2 will use GF mice colonized with human fecal bacteria from various developmental ages, to determine the roles of antibiotics and the probiotic L. acidophilus in re-programming the ontogeny of human microbiome and the subsequent changes in the host DPGs during liver development. The proposed work will unveil a novel link between the ontogeny of gut microbiome and the developmental changes of drug- processing capacities during development, and will lead to a paradigm shift in pediatric pharmacology, by establishing a new concept in considering ADRs in children, which are the bug-drug interactions, in addition to the known drug-drug and food-drug interactions."
"9349567","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the successes of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), important challenges remain that still limit their impact on human biology and medicine, especially for non-coding variants which remain poorly understood. In this proposal, we exploit recent advances (many pioneered by our group) to overcome these challenges and gain a systematic understanding of the role of non-coding variants in human disease and complex traits. First, we develop new statistical methods that utilize high-resolution regulatory annotations to predict disease-relevant tissues, chromatin states, and regulatory motifs, and to prioritize non-coding variants more likely to have regulatory effects within regions of genetic association using epigenomic state information, comparative genomic information, and regulatory motif analysis (Aim 1). Second, we develop a new Bayesian methods for linking regulatory regions to their upstream regulators and downstream target genes by integrating genetic information across all associated regions in the context of regulatory networks that link regulators and regulatory regions using their correlated activity, regulatory motifs, and expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) information (Aim 2). Third, we validate our methods and predictions using massively-parallel enhancer assays to test the effect of large number of regulatory variants in isolation; using genome editing technologies to test the effects of regulatory variants in their endogenous context; and using cellular phenotypes and animal models to test the physiological effects of regulatory variants at the cellular and organismal levels (Aim 3), and use the results to refine our computational methods and models. Even though our experimental validations are only performed for a small number of traits and cell types that are amenable to such studies, our methods are general and will be applied to all genetic studies available through ongoing collaborations and public catalogs."
"9392966","Project Summary The overall goal of our research program is to elucidate the underlying molecular principles that govern synaptic plasticity associated with chronic pain. Chronic neuropathic pain is a significant and unmet clinical problem. Glutamate ?-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) mediate the vast majority of fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the mammalian central nervous system. AMPARs are tetrameric cation channels composed of a combinational assembly of four subunits, GluA1 through GluA4. GluA2 is particularly important for the biophysical properties of AMPARs because GluA2-containing AMPARs are impermeable to Ca2+. In contrast, GluA2-lacking AMPARs show inward-rectifying currents and have a high Ca2+ permeability and are thus referred to as Ca2+-permeable AMPARs (CP-AMPARs). The prevalence of synaptic CP-AMPARs of spinal dorsal horn neurons is markedly increased in neuropathic pain. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the switch of AMPAR subunit composition in neuropathic pain remain little known. The major objective of our proposal is to determine the key molecular mechanism responsible for regulating the assembly and trafficking of CP-AMPARs in neuropathic pain. ?2?-1, often considered a Ca2+ channel subunit, is upregulated in the spinal dorsal horn in neuropathic pain. Our preliminary studies showed that ?2?-1 interacted with AMPAR subunits in vitro and in vivo and that increased ?2?-1 expression promoted synaptic incorporation of CP-AMPARs in the spinal dorsal horn. In this proposal, we will test our overall hypothesis that ?2?-1 potentiates the synaptic CP-AMPAR prevalence in spinal dorsal horn neurons in neuropathic pain through physical interaction with AMPAR subunits to preferentially regulate their subunit composition and synaptic trafficking. We will use a multidisciplinary approach to study ?2?-1?AMPAR coupling and its distinct role in neuropathic pain at molecular, cellular, and behavioral levels. At the completion of our project, we will gain significant mechanistic insight into the poorly defined role of ?2?-1 in synaptic plasticity and neuropathic pain caused by nerve injury and diabetic neuropathy. This new information will redefine the physiological function ?2?-1 and the role of ?2?-1?bound CP-AMPARs in the therapeutic effects of gabapentinoids. Therefore, the findings from the proposed studies will have a sustained positive impact by advancing our understanding of the synaptic mechanism of neuropathic pain, leading to the development of new therapies for chronic neuropathic pain."

"9316781","PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal investigates the mechanism(s) downstream of delta that promote differentiation. The Notch-Delta signaling pathway is a conserved regulator of differentiation in animals. Improper Notch- Delta signaling leads to defects in organogenesis, cell fate specification, maintenance of stem cells, and can result in aggressive tumor growth in cancers. The majority of research investigating Notch- Delta signaling focuses on activation of Notch, and its role in promoting maintenance of a proliferative undifferentiated stem-like cell fate. However, Delta is also activated, but little is known about what events occur downstream of Delta activation. Multiple studies suggest that Delta activation leads to cellular differentiation. Release and nuclear localization of the Delta intracellular domain appear to be a key factors to promote differentiation. Preliminary data during development of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis argue that the intracellular domain of Delta (DeltaICD) localizes to the nucleus, and that DeltaICD is necessary and sufficient to promote neural differentiation. We identified ~80 putative down stream targets of Delta. This proposal takes advantage of these observations to investigate the role of Delta during differentiation. In aim1, the requirement for the nuclear localization of the intracellular domain of Delta to promote differentiation is tested. We will generate an antibody against the DeltaICD, generate mutants lacking the DeltaICD, and use misexpression of nuclear localized or nuclear excluded Deltas to determine if endogenous DeltaICD localizes to the nucleus and if nuclear localization is required to promote expression of neural differentiation markers. Aim2 focuses on determining which putative Delta targets most likely promote differentiation. To achieve this goal we first establish which targets require the DeltaICD using qPCR analysis to determine genes with opposite changes in expression in delta knockdowns compared to the change in expression observed in animals with hyperactivated Delta. Second, we use mRNA in situ expression approaches to determine which genes are expressed in a pattern consistent with an upstream regulator of differentiation. This work will confirm that Delta promotes differentiation by regulating expression of differentiation markers, and it will identify key genes for futures studies that will result in a detailed mechanistic understanding of cellular differentiation downstream of Delta. These data will not only improve our understanding of how normal development occurs, but will also inform us about the biology of aggressive cancers and perhaps offer novel therapeutic approaches to treat them."

"9379141","Project Summary/Abstract Tumor resistance to radiotherapy continues to be a significant problem in improving outcomes of patients diagnosed with locally advanced, unresectable cancers including head and neck (HNC). Cellular sensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR) is governed by intracellular and extracellular factors. To help overcome tumor radioresistance, drugs that sensitize tumor to ionizing radiation (IR) are used. In theory, more potent radiosensitizers should increase tumor kill and improve patient outcomes. In practice, the clinical utility of of such drugs is curtailed by side effects that limit doses. To address these issues, we are developing activatable cell penetrating peptide (ACPP) probes to monitor and selectively deliver conjugated radiosensitizers to tumors based on extracellular tumor protease activity. ACPP consist of a drug conjugated polycationic cell penetrating peptide and an autoinhibitory polyanionic peptide separated from each other by a flexible peptide linker. Our initial peptide linker is cleaved by matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) 2/9, abundantly expressed in tumors. Intact, drug conjugated ACPP is ?pro-drug? where the the drug linked cell penetrating peptide is neutralized by the polyanionic peptide, blocking intracellular drug uptake. Upon encountering MMP 2/9 within tumors, ACPP is cleaved (i.e. ?activated?) and releases the drug conjugated cell-penetrating peptide, which is then taken up by tumor cells. An advantage of our ACPP probes is that they can be designed to non-invasively image extracellular tumor protease activities by synthesizing ratiometric ACPP. Ratiometric ACPP are labeled with Cy5 and Cy7 on the polycationic and polyanionic peptide respectively, acting as a FRET donor/acceptor pair. By using different protease sensitive peptide linker sequences between the two charged polypeptides, ratiometric ACPP Cy5:Cy7 emission ratio non-invasively measures distinct tumor protease activities in situ. A unique property of ACPP is the dependency on protease cleavage begets enzymatic amplification in the area of interest. The goals of our proposal are to develop ACPP probes to selectively radiosensitize tumors. In Aim 1, we will test the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and efficacy of ACPP conjugated radiosensitizers in murine HNC models. To achieve this, drugs and fluorophores will be conjugated to ACPP and combined with IR. In Aim 2, we will interrogate in situ how IR alters extracellular protease activities in a dose dependent and temporal manner using a panel of ratiometric ACPP with distinct linkers cleaved preferentially by specific proteases. Identifying IR inducible ACPP cleavage will promote IR guided drug delivery development. In summary, ACPP radiosensitizer delivery has several innovative features that warrant pre-clinical inquiry. Diagnostically, ratiometric ACPP allows for non-invasive imaging of intrinsic tumor microenvironment proteases and IR's extrinsic influence. Therapeutically, ACPP's modular architecture allows for permutations of different classes radiosensitizing drugs to be conjugated to ACPPs with distinct protease linkers. Together, our studies will test how ACPPs can be exploited to improve the therapeutic ratio of radiotherapy."
"9406675","Project Summary ONC201 is a selective antagonist of the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) dopamine receptor domain 2 (DRD2) that is overexpressed in endometrial cancer (EC) due to its p53-independent control of the Akt/ERK signaling pathways. ONC201 is a first-in-class small molecule exhibits anticancer efficacy in a wide range of refractory cancers, including p53 mutant cells, by simultaneously inactivating Akt and ERK signaling, resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Type II EC comprises non-endometrioid histology (i.e. serous, clear cell and mucinous) that are generally associated with more aggressive clinical behavior. This proposal supports a clinical trial of ONC201 in Type II EC patients with recurrent disease, who have mutations in p53 as well as deregulated Akt and ERK pathways in their tumors. In clinical trials, ONC201 has been exceptional well tolerated, possessed a therapeutic pharmacokinetic profile, and exhibited sustained pharmacodynamics and anti-cancer activity in advanced cancer patients. No > Grade 1 drug-related adverse events were observed in the first-in-human trial, despite achieving therapeutic blood levels and demonstrating signs of biological activity. Of the 28 evaluable patients in that trial, there were 5 advanced endometrial cancer patients and several exhibited clinical benefit and all expressed DRD2 in their archival tumor specimens. Among these heavily-pretreated 5 patients, the median number of prior treatments was 5 (3-6), 3 patients had prior radiation and all patients had prior surgery. After 2 doses of ONC201, one patient with clear cell EC had a mixed response with >50% decrease in lymphadenopathy. Two EC patients experienced prolonged stable disease lasting for 18 and 42 weeks, including a 56 year-old patient with serous- papillary EC who also had a significant and sustained reduction in the size of a metastatic lung lesion. Thus, EC emerged as the most promising tumor type from a preliminary efficacy perspective in this first-in-human trial in advanced solid tumors. Based on the clinical responses observed in this patient population, in this fast-track application we propose to first evaluate a pilot cohort of patients to evaluate the preliminary single agent efficacy profile in Type II EC patients. Depending on these clinical results, we will then conduct a larger study enrolling an additional 30 patients to determine the efficacy of ONC201 either as a single agent or in combination with paclitaxel. Phase/Aim#1: Evaluation of preliminary single agent efficacy profile in Type II EC patients. Phase/Aim #2: Determine the efficacy of ONC201 in Type II EC. This proposal seeks to provide a safe and durable treatment for patients with a disease that has few treatment options and a dismal prognosis."
"9395036","Project Summary/Abstract Description: The use of mobile apps in healthcare is a rapidly expanding field with the potential to produce positive patient outcomes with an estimated 40,000 to 60,000 mHealth apps available for download in the U.S. With such a vast number of available mHealth apps, healthcare providers including physicians, physicians' assistants, and advanced practice nurses, may find the selection of an effective mHealth app overwhelming. As the mHealth field continues to grow and develop, healthcare providers will require a comprehensive, effective, and reliable evidence-based evaluation tool to assist in the selection of mHealth apps for the management of chronic health conditions. The lack of an evidence-based evaluation tool that assesses the effectiveness of mHealth apps to manage chronic health conditions further complicates the problem. Therefore, this proposal recommends the creation of an evidence-based evaluation tool for healthcare providers utilizing the results of a research synthesis and the current mHealth evaluation tools to guide the development process. The research synthesis explored the mHealth literature and identified four specific features within the mHealth apps associated with positive biometric patient outcomes for chronic disease management. An evaluation of the current mHealth evaluation tools revealed they were time-consuming with complex mathematical computations, confusing to complete, highly subjective, and failed to meet the needs of the healthcare provider in selecting an evidence-based mHealth app. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to develop a mHealth evaluation tool that includes the four mHealth features identified in the research synthesis while incorporating the domains and questions from the current mHealth evaluation tools and conduct a proof- of-concept on the evaluation tool. It is hypothesized that the development and proof-of-concept testing of an evidence-based evaluation tool for mHealth apps will correctly identify effective mHealth apps. The specific aims include: 1) define a comprehensive pool of domains and questions for a mHealth evaluation tool utilizing findings from the research synthesis on mHealth studies and the analysis of current mHealth evaluation tools; 2) develop a new evidence-based mHealth evaluation tool with the feedback from healthcare providers via an online survey of the comprehensive pools of domains and questions; and 3) conduct proof-of-concept testing on mHealth evaluation tool on mHealth apps that manage chronic health conditions. This fellowship award will provide the necessary training and mentoring to further Sara Donevant's knowledge and skill in mHealth nursing research, which establishes a foundation for her nursing research career. In addition, the completion of this fellowship will position Sara Donevant to undertake further testing and validation of the mHealth evaluation tool through a pilot test, efficacy trial, and effectiveness research."

"9541659","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parasites of the trypanosomatid protozoan genus Leishmania are responsible for a spectrum of tropical diseases, afflicting more than 10 million people worldwide; depending on the species and immune status of the infected person, this disease can be severe or fatal. In Brasil, Africa and the Mediterranean basin, leishmaniasis is a common opportunistic infection in AIDS patients, many US soldiers now stationed in the Middle East have been infected, and there is a worrisome sense that Leishmania species may be emerging or expanding in the US. The surface of the Leishmania parasite is covered by a complex carbohydrate glycocalyx, whose structure and activities are tailored to meet the parasite's needs when growing in the sand fly vector as flagellated promastigotes, or within vertebrate macrophage phagolysosome as the roundish amastigote, where it survives happily in a hostile environment and evades immune defenses. Our group and collaborators pioneered powerful methods for the generation of mutants defect in the synthesis of the surface coat, originally focusing on the abundant lipophosphoglycan (LPG) as well as structurally related carbohydrates such as proteophosphoglycan (PPG), and more recently on molecules synthesized by the action of a novel mitochondrial fucosyltransefase. These mutants define vital biosynthetic proteins required for glycoconjugate synthesis and virulence, and the study of their impact on specific aspects of the infectious cycle enables a deeper understanding of their unique vs. overlapping roles. Several of the enzymes identified show considerable promise as targets for chemotherapy, or in the development of strategies focusing on parasite vaccination and interruption of transmission."
"9383862","Formation of functional neural circuits is critical for proper functioning of the brain. To establish the most efficient synaptic circuits, synaptic connections must be refined by neural activity during development. In this proposal, we will determine the molecules and manner by which functional circuits are established by neural activity, focusing on the limbic system (including the hippocampus and cingulate cortex), which is implicated in emotional processing, memory formation and social behavior. Using a mouse genetic system in which restricted populations of hippocampal neurons can be conditionally inactivated, we found that hippocampal axons are refined through activity-dependent competition, where active neuronal connections stay (maintained) while inactive ones leave (eliminated). We further found that a cell adhesion molecule SIRP? from postsynaptic neurons stabilizes active synapses through its presynaptic receptor CD47, serving as a Stay signal. To identify the signaling molecules that play critical roles in inactive axon elimination (Go signal), we generated a new system in which neural activity and gene expression can be conditionally controlled in vivo, using in utero electroporation. When neurotransmitter release is blocked in a subset of neurons in the cingulate cortex, their callosal projections (the major connections between the cerebral hemispheres) are eliminated during development. Using this system, we screened for signaling molecules that are upregulated in inactive neurons right before their axons start to leave and identified the Ca2+-dependent tyrosine kinase Pyk2. Inactive axons were not eliminated when a kinase-dead mutant of Pyk2 was expressed, indicating that Pyk2 activity is necessary for inactive axons to leave. We further identified that a Pyk2-interacting kinase, JAK2, is also necessary for inactive axon elimination. Consistently, Pyk2 and JAK2 are activated in inactive neurons. Finally, we found that overexpression of Pyk2 or JAK2 induces axonal elimination even when axons are active. We propose that the Pyk2-JAK2 pathway is the Go signal and serves as the determinant of axon refinement. To further characterize this pathway and to understand how the Go and Stay pathways regulate activity- dependent axon/synapse refinement, we propose to: Aim 1: Investigate the role of Pyk2 and JAK2 for axon/synapse refinement in physiological conditions. Aim 2: Analyze the electrophysiological consequences of Pyk2/JAK2 inactivation during synapse refinement using conditional KO mice. Aim 3: Examine whether the Pyk2-JAK2 pathway provides cues for microglial clearance of inactive axons in vivo. Aim 4: Investigate the interaction between the Stay (SIRP?-CD47) and Go (Pyk2-JAK2) pathways in axon/synapse refinement in vivo. Our project will molecularly delineate how neurons decide to establish functional synaptic connections in the mammalian brain. Pyk2 and JAK2 are associated with various neuropsychiatric disorders. Many forms of mental illness including autism and schizophrenia are associated with abnormal alterations in the limbic circuitry. Thus, our studies should also yield novel insights into the etiology and treatment of such disorders."
"9324798","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Long Life Family Study (LLFS), established in 2005 in response to an NIA RFA, enrolled families enriched for exceptional longevity (EL), to discover factors that contribute to healthy aging and survival. From 2006 to 2009, LLFS enrolled 539 sibships (G1), their offspring (G2) and spouses (total 4,953). Comparison with a referent cohort reveals that LLFS families have strong exceptional clustering of EL. The G2 offspring have a variety of Healthy Aging Phenotypes (HAPs), defined as an unusually low age-specific prevalence of one or more specific conditions or risk factors, compared to population-based cohorts suggesting enrichment of shared (possibly genetic) protective effects in LLFS families. In the second funding period (2010-2013), we conducted a 2.5 million SNP GWAS (dbGaP phs000397); developed a high-throughput technique and sequenced ~450 candidate genes and replicated many variants and found additional ones associated with Healthy Aging Phenotypes (HAP) and longevity. 54% of LLFS G1 and 92% of G2 remain alive. Participant retention has been 94%. We now propose a third funding period to conduct a second in-person examination (V2) to prospectively study rates of change in HAPs with age and identify genetic and other factors contributing to HAPs and longevity. We hypothesize that EL and HAPs entail common and rare variants that individually have modest effects, but which in combinations strongly influence longevity and specific HAPs, and may only be detectable in family studies enriched for HAPs, such as LLFS. HAPs evaluated at the initial in-person visit show strong linkage peaks which are not explained by common haplotypes interrogated by GWAS (HLODs ranging from 6.0-45.1). These are likely driven by rare, lineage-private alleles that will only be found by sequencing specific families, and may point to important new biology. Specific Aim 1 is to conduct a second in-home examination on all surviving LLFS participants. Specific Aim 2 is to analyze cross-sectional and longitudinal phenotypes. The goal is to identify pathways for EL and HAPs by characterizing the shared and distinct LLFS phenotypes and environmental factors. We will characterize individual longitudinal patterns of HAPs to identify subgroups showing similar patterns and exceptional phenotypes. We will test whether these HAPs are heritable, and test for differences with internal and external referent groups. Specific Aim 3 is to find genes/variants associated with cross-sectional and longitudinal phenotypes using a) Whole Exome Sequencing to comprehensively search for coding variants associated with HAPs and EL and b) Targeted Regulatory Sequencing of regions under linkage peaks for HAPs in selected families showing the strongest linkage evidence. Specific Aim 4 is to replicate our genetic and epidemiological findings in other aging study cohorts. This study could lead to the discovery of pathways and potential therapeutic/prevention targets affecting HAPs and EL. A Data Management and Coordinating Center and 4 Field Centers comprise the major components of the LLFS. This renewal application is submitted by the Duke Uni./Uni. of Southern Denmark Field Center."
"9331347","Project Summary Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from intimate partner violence (IPV) is a common experience among women?one that has been linked to dysfunctional parenting behaviors. Despite the prevalence of IPV- related PTSD and its impact on parenting, little is known about the mechanisms responsible for this association. The present project addresses this gap by examining the impact of IPV-related PTSD on dysfunctional parenting behaviors in a laboratory setting. Based on prior theory and empirical evidence, it is expected that a diagnosis of PTSD will be associated with more dysfunctional parenting (i.e., harsh/overreactive and lax/permissive behaviors) during routine mother-child discipline encounters. Further, drawing on prior research linking negative emotion and greater dysregulated cortisol reactivity (i.e., high or dampened) to both PTSD and dysfunctional parenting, we expect that experienced emotion and cortisol reactivity will fully mediate the relationship between PTSD status and dysfunctional parenting behaviors. To test these hypotheses, mothers and their 18- to 42-month-old children will complete a laboratory paradigm designed to elicit typical discipline encounters occurring with young children. Shortly thereafter, mothers will view a video of the interaction and provide in-the-moment ratings of their experienced emotions. Salivary cortisol will be collected from mothers prior and subsequent to the lab paradigm to assess stress-related cortisol reactivity. Knowledge gained from this study is expected to improve intervention and prevention efforts for mothers with IPV-related PTSD and their families by informing researchers and practitioners about the processes by which PTSD impacts parenting behaviors."
"9470605","PROJECT ABSTRACT Brain acidification occurs in excitotoxicity, following disrupted metabolism, and in multiple diseases including ischemia, multiple sclerosis, and traumatic brain injury. Given the prevalence of acidosis in disease, determining molecular mechanisms underlying acid signaling will have broad translational value. It has been known for decades that acidosis is one key contributing factor to neuronal injury. Paradoxically, a relatively mild acidosis can be protective. In recent years, a lot of progress has been made on understanding how acidosis leads to neuronal injury. This is largely due to the discovery of acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), which are a family of proton gated cation channels. A series of data, including ours, show that ASICs are the major postsynaptic proton receptor in brain neurons, and one key mediator of acidosis-induced neuronal injury. These data on ASICs have greatly advanced our knowledge of acid signaling. However, ASICs do not appear to explain the protective effect of acidosis. In our preliminary studies, we found that ovarian cancer G protein coupled receptor 1 (OGR1), a proton-sensitive G protein coupled receptor (GPCR), is widely expressed in the brain. In addition, OGR1 mediates acid-induced signaling in hippocampal slices. Our data further suggest that OGR1 mediates a protective pathway in acidotic and ischemic conditions. Here, we will use middle cerebral artery occlusion, a widely used rodent model for studying ischemia-induced brain injury, and determine whether OGR1 activation leads to neuroprotection following ischemia. To better understand the mechanism, we will use in vitro cell culture and slice models to determine downstream signaling that mediates the effect of OGR1. Results obtained from the proposed study will uncover novel protective mechanisms mediating extracellular acid signaling, and provide potential molecular targets for the design of novel therapeutic approaches to alleviate ischemia-induced brain injury."

The large-scale distribution colonies that supply mice to the external research community are managed independently from the JAXCC by an administrative arm called JAX Mice & Services. The distribution colonies are financially self-supporting and, as a not-for-profit organization, generate surpluses that support fundamental research.    The JAXCC occupies facilities on three JAX campuses, described below. The main JAX campus is an ~ 750,000 ft[2] facility in Bar Harbor Maine. We have launched a major expansion with the opening of a campus adjacent to the University of Connecticut Health Center (UCHC) in Farmington, Connecticut. This new campus, called The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine (JAX Genomic Medicine), will be a 189,000 ft[2] facility, to be completed in 2014. JAXCC members on this campus focus on human cancer genomics, computational biology and their application for precision medicine. The third campus, the JAX-West facility in Sacramento, California?has expanded to include a large, collaborative resource of patient-derived xenografted (PDX) primary human cancers, significantly enhancing the cancer resources ofthe JAXCC. The original campus in Bar Harbor has been renamed The Jackson Laboratory for Mammalian Genetics (JAX Mammalian Genetics) to reflect its role within the expanded three-campus framework. In total, we have an institution that has remarkable infrastructure to innovate and conduct science in mammalian genetics. The geographically distributed nature ofthe campuses is to our advantage in being able to capitalize on local (state) resources and talent, but unified by leadership, organization, and our focus on genetics and genomics."

"9505273","Overall AACORT Abstract The Alopecia Areata Center of Research Translation (AACORT) at Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) is focused on the singular goal of developing new treatments for alopecia areata (AA). The mission of the AACORT is to leverage our recent discoveries beginning to unravel the genetic basis of AA and the fact that its pathogenesis is linked to dysregulation of both innate and acquired immunity, and to synergize these findings into translational studies that will lead to novel therapies for this disease, including the repurposing of existing drugs. In the past few years, the AACORT team has made transformative progress in understanding the genetic basis of AA, as well as initiating a series of clinical trials employing mechanism-driven targeted JAK inhibitors aimed at reversing the disease. While this class of drugs is having a profound impact on guiding clinical development efforts in AA, there is much more work to be done, since clearly many patients do not respond to these drugs. The goal of this AACORT is to build upon our established translational pipeline to leverage our basic and preclinical discoveries into the clinical setting. This AACORT is centered around a central Research Project that focuses on the Translational Science of Alopecia Areata, and deals with innovative translational aspects of the disease, including initiating factors such as the microbiome; preclinical studies focused on antigen discovery and testing new therapeutic approaches in vitro and in vivo; and clinical correlative studies designed to rigorously assess the efficacy and safety of new drugs coming available for patients with AA. The Research Project is supported by the Translational and Clinical Resource Core (TRAC), and the Data Analysis and Translational Applications (DATA) Core, which bring together an outstanding cadre of talented, committed and scientifically diverse faculty from across the institution. The AACORT is supported by a highly capable and experienced Administrative Core that provides its vitally important organizational infrastructure. The goal of the AACORT is to surmount barriers to translational application of basic discoveries that have the potential to revolutionize the management of this heretofore intractable and debilitating disorder."

Mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (mt-ARSs) are essential for protein synthesis in mitochondria, and disruption of mt-ARS function represents a new class of mitochondrial disease. A novel disorder caused by recessive, single nucleotide variants in methionyl-tRNA synthetase 2 (MARS2) associated with developmental delay, growth failure, and sensorineural hearing loss has been identified by the candidate. The proposed project will utilize an integrative approach, combining both wet-laboratory and in silico techniques, to further study mt-ARS disorders. Pathogenic variants in MARS2 will be further characterized biochemically by assessing aminoacylation activity, mitochondrial protein synthesis, and mitochondrial oxygen consumption. To better understand the variable phenotypes and tissue specificity of different mt-ARS disorders, an in vitro model system of several mt-ARS disorders will be developed using CRISPR/Cas9 technologies. RNA-seq data will be generated and network analysis will be completed to identify key drivers and developmental pathways involved in mt-ARS disorders.   "

"9298607","The five year survival rate among children diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has surpassed 90%. Unfortunately, cure is not without consequences. ALL survivors are at elevated risk for obesity, low bone mineral density, cardiomyopathy, peripheral neuropathy, and altered psychosocial functioning. Research is critically needed to provide survivors with tools to improve their long term health. Because children with leukemia are likely to adopt a sedentary lifestyle that persists long into survivorship, and because a sedentary lifestyle may perpetuate or exacerbate many of the complications experienced by ALL survivors, a portable and generalizable intervention that promotes physical activity and impacts fitness and biomarkers of cardiometabolic health in the first year after treatment may be of particular benefit. This proposal is designed to access the resources of the Children's Oncology Group (COG) and complements ongoing therapeutic protocols. It will draw upon the existing infrastructure and expertise of the COG to recruit a sample of children as they complete treatment for childhood ALL. The primary goals of this study are to evaluate the effects of a rewards-based physical activity intervention, delivered via an interactive website for children with ALL, during a six month period beginning any time during the first three months after the end of curative chemotherapy, on fitness, biomarkers of cardiometabolic health, inflammation, adipokine status, quality of life and school attendance. We also plan to evaluate if the effects of the intervention on markers of cardiometabolic health are mediated by changes in fitness. To achieve this goal we have designed a two-arm, prospective, randomized study with a rewards- based intervention group (N=192) and a control group (N=192). The control group will receive educational materials encouraging physical activity, including information about activity modifications for common neuromusculoskeletal deficits (e.g. neuropathy, weakness), and an activity monitor to record physical activity levels. The intervention group will receive the same educational materials, the activity monitor, and access to a rewards-based interactive website designed to motivate increased levels of physical activity. Intervention group participants will receive points based on physical activity levels. Points are redeemed for small gift cards ($5.00) during the course of the study. Based on our pilot study, the average child/adolescent will earn eight gift cards. Individual physical activity levels are uploaded to the website (with acknowledgement of the data upload for control group participants, and with an interactive video game-type dashboard for intervention group participants when the activity monitor is connected to a computer). Rewards and encouragement are provided by the website based on the intervention participants' measured physical activity levels. Children who are initially less active still earn points as the rewards system is based on individual baseline physical activity. Evaluation time points are planned at baseline, after intervention, and six months and one year after the intervention is completed."
"9378693","Project Summary/Abstract Vaccination is essential to the global fight against infectious diseases. However, some pathogens are experts at evading the immune response, and therefore present a challenge to current vaccination strategies. Influenza vaccination is currently only 60% effective, and depends on proper predictions of influenza strains that will become seasonal epidemics every year. HIV vaccination has been unsuccessful thus far, with some vaccine trials resulting in adverse outcomes. Traditionally, vaccine design focuses on eliciting memory responses by effector cells of the adaptive immune system. However, it is unknown how cells of the innate immune system respond to vaccination, and whether they play a role in successful vaccine responses. Natural killer (NK) cells are effector cells of the innate immune system that respond rapidly to viral infection. In this proposal, we aim to determine the effect of influenza or HIV vaccination on NK cells. We will deeply interrogate the NK cell response to vaccination by using mass cytometry, an innovative new technology that allows the analysis of 40+ protein expression parameters simultaneously at the single cell level. This method will allow us to analyze clinical samples from influenza and HIV vaccine studies in great depth. Additionally, we will determine the cell biological mechanisms involved in generation of a diverse and functional NK repertoire by analyzing the genome-wide epigenetic profiles of NK cells that respond to vaccination and viral infection. This will allow us to define signatures of NK cell maturation, activation, and diversification. These studies will deepen our understanding of the innate immune response to vaccination, which will lay the foundation for future vaccine designs that incorporate both the innate and the adaptive immune systems."
"9315884","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a deadly disease with no effective therapy. Clinically, PAH is subdivided into categories based on etiology including hereditary, drug-induced, and idiopathic. Hereditary PAH is most often caused by a mutation in the Bmpr2 receptor, drug-induced PAH is due to activation of serotonergic pathways through the 5-HT2B receptor, and idiopathic shows associations with both. Regardless of subtype, PAH manifestations are strikingly similar both histologically and symptomatically, and evidence from previous studies implicates a convergence on a single molecular pathway. Our preliminary data illustrates that mice with a mutation in the cytoplasmic tail domain of Bmpr2 (one of the most common mutations found in hereditary PAH) have indicators of elevated Src signaling in the cells of their pulmonary microvasculature (PMVCs). Further data shows that these indicators are reduced to normal levels after treatment with a 5-HT2B antagonist, and treated mice ultimately fail to develop PAH. While antagonist treatment does not affect Src phosphorylation, it does significantly reduce Src motility in PMVCs. This preliminary data strongly suggests that irregular Src trafficking lies at the convergence between hereditary and serotonergic PAH and is ultimately responsible for the biomechanical and physiologic consequences of the Bmpr2 mutation. Biomechanical consequences of the Bmpr2 mutation include increased vessel wall stiffness as well as an increase in PMVC contractility reversed with 5-HT2B antagonism. We have identified three signaling pathways downstream of Src that we believe are responsible for regulating these vessel biomechanical properties, and aim to test the following independent hypotheses: (1) Src signaling is responsible for the pathologic biomechanical consequences of the Bmpr2 mutation in hereditary PAH, and these consequences can be reversed with 5- HT2B antagonism; (2) 5-HT2B antagonism normalizes Src activity in Bmpr2 mutant PMVCs by preventing intracellular trafficking of activated Src. The proposed studies will be the first to clarify the mechanism of Src signaling and trafficking in the molecular pathogenesis of PAH. They will also be the first to address the targeting of the 5-HT2B receptor for treating hereditary PAH, providing a molecular link between different PAH types and opening the door for a safe and specific therapy."
"9360861","Abstract Infertile couples are increasingly turning to Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) to treat their infertility. Of growing concern is that ART-conceived children are at increased risk for specific loss-of-imprinting disorders, congenital malformations, growth restriction, preeclampsia as well as postnatal cardiac and metabolic disorders. Given the difficulty of conducting studies using human embryos, a mouse model system, which anticipated some risks associated with ART, will be used to assess the effects of ART on placental morphology, imprinted gene regulation, growth, metabolic, cardiac and behavioral phenotypes of the offspring, and gene expression and chromatin structure genome-wide. Specific Aim 1 will assess the phenotypes, including growth, behavior metabolism and cardiovascular function, of ART-offspring in comparison to naturally-conceived controls. We will also interrogate imprinted gene regulation and gene expression, DNA methylation and chromatin structure using gene-specific and high throughput analyses. Moreover, the design of this aim will enable us to isolate, phenotype and match placenta to offspring to determine whether the placental phenotype can accurately predict health of in vitro fertilization (IVF)-derived offspring. Because we have previously reported a low frequency of epigenetic errors in multiple tissues of IVF-conceived offspring, we hypothesize that the germline cells also harbor epigenetic mutations. In Specific Aim 2, we will test this hypothesis by determining whether aberrant phenotypes observed in IVF offspring are transmitted to subsequent generations and, if so, assess the mechanism of this transmission. The result from these experiments will provide a trove of information regarding the linkage between epigenetic changes and health of offspring conceived by ART and whether placental phenotyping can predict offspring health. Our findings may also suggest experimental modifications to ART procedures that can improve offspring outcomes. !"

"9382093","PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT Proper cellular differentiation is essential for healthy embryonic development, and new discoveries regarding cellular differentiation will impact the cancer, stem cell, and regenerative medicine fields. Caenorhabditis elegans is a nearly ideal model of cellular differentiation because the cell lineage is predictive and fully mapped from fertilization to adulthood (Sulston et al., 1977; Sulston et al., 1984). To determine molecular hallmarks that distinguish cells as they progress through early embryogenesis, we have generated a single-cell-resolution, whole-transcriptome RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) map of the C. elegans early embryo (Osborne Nishimura, et al., 2015; Tintori et al, 2016). Many developmental systems (human, mouse, etc) are also amenable to single-cell RNA-seq assays. However, it remains challenging in those organisms to conduct downstream research efforts aimed at dissecting the mechanisms critical for cellular differentiation and development. Because C. elegans affords more tractable genetics assays, microscopy, and quantification of cell fate changes, we aim to exploit the system to identify 1) mechanisms that pattern cell-specific transcriptomes prior to zygotic transcription, 2) the functional impact of mRNA dynamics on protein production and cellular differentiation, and 3) gene regulatory networks that orchestrate the first waves of cell-specific transcription and differentiation. Surprisingly, we have discovered fascinating sub-cellular localization patterns (e.g. nuclear, cell cortex, granules) in some asymmetrically partitioned mRNAs of the very early embryo. This presents us with a unique opportunity to study the link between mRNA localization, translational control, and developmental outcome in a system that is not confounded by nascent transcription. Our goal is to illuminate how systems biology approaches can inform our functional understanding of cellular differentiation and development in an intact living organism. !"

"9318277","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The last decade of research in intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) has been notably characterized by rapid advances in understanding the nature and complexity of inherited susceptibilities to IDD, but genetic discovery has not yet fulfilled the promise of more effective intervention, even for monogenic IDD syndromes. It is the immediate priority of a next generation of research to capitalize upon knowledge about causation in IDD (both genetic and environmental) and translate it into higher-impact intervention for as many individuals and families affected as possible. In the second cycle of the IDDRC at Washington University in St. Louis (IDDRC@WUSTL), our strategy for contributing to this effort preserves our Center's original focus on characterization of white matter injury to the newborn brain, but extends the scope of Core activity to facilitate a comprehensive approach to understanding and preventing developmental disorders of neural connectivity at the respective levels of cell, synapse, circuit, and behavior, and brings on line major strengths of WUSTL in genomics, behavioral/cognitive neuroscience, and clinical-translational science.  The overarching goals of our Center are as follows: (1) To facilitate high-caliber, translational research on the pathogenesis and treatment of IDDs by sustaining an innovative Core structure that attracts and supports qualified, collaborative investigators, and interacts synergistically with complementary Core facilities of other U.S. IDDRCs. We propose to support an Administrative Core, a Developmental Neuroimaging Core, a Model Systems Core (encompassing capacity and expertise for both animal and cellular models of IDD), and a Clinical Translational Core. (2) To cultivate nodes of interdisciplinary scientific activity in frotiers of IDD research which are critical for the derivation of higher-impact treatment and preventive intervention, across 4 major themes: (i) The prevention of prematurity and its neurodevelopmental consequences; (ii) The elucidation of robust intermediate DD phenotypes (as markers of pathogenic processes, targets of early intervention, and indices of response to treatment); (iii) In-depth characterization of the developing human brain, and (iv) Functional genomic approaches to elucidating convergent mechanisms of IDD pathogenesis. (3) To conduct a signature research project that represents a bold, critical step toward higher-impact intervention for IDD, capitalizes upon both the Core structure of our IDDRC and institutional strengths at WUSTL, and epitomizes the manner in which our IDDRC facilitates trans-disciplinary research. Our project is designed to elucidate mechanisms of sex-specific modulation-of-expression of inherited risk for autism spectrum disorders, at the respective levels of cell, brain, and behavior. A goal is to identify compensatory mechanisms underlying resilience among females in ASD-affected families, for the purpose of recapitulating those mechanisms in novel interventions which would be of major relevance to a large proportion of the population of individuals at risk or affected by familial autistic syndromes."
"9322358","Summary/Abstract There is growing evidence suggesting that the epigenetic processes such as histone acetylation may play a role in the alcohol-induced gene regulations and behavior. To date, the studies in animals demonstrated that histone deacetylases (HDACs), at least HDAC2 and HDAC3, could induce histone-related epigenetic changes after the treatment of ethanol. In addition, several studies have shown that HDAC inhibitors could be used to counter ethanol-induced behaviors and the ethanol-induced changes of HDAC levels. We have recently achieved a major research goal by developing a PET imaging agent, [11C]Martinostat that selectively binds to a subset of HDAC enzymes. [11C]Martinostat has been full characterized as a novel and the first PET radiotracer for epigenetic research through rodent imaging, non-human primates (NHPs) imaging and pilot healthy human imaging. We are extremely excited to take a large step forward in understanding epigenetic role in alcoholism by visualizing HDACs in the healthy and dysfunctional human brain in alcohol use disorder (AUD) patients. Together with the our multidisciplinary teams and strong collaborations, we are seeking the support through the R21/R33 mechanism for this high-risk, high-reward study to characterize the density and distribution of key HDACs throughout the brain of healthy subjects and in patients with alcoholism by applying our new PET imaging probe. Our initial data on [11C]Martinostat in humans strongly supports the success of our proposal for clinical imaging in healthy subjects (Aim 1) and in AUD patients (Aim 2 and Aim 3) in R21/R33 phases. PET-MR imaging in humans with [11C]Martinostat will deliver answers to fundamental questions about chromatin modifying enzymes in the living human brain in a way that has not been possible until now and facilitate proof of mechanism/target engagement in novel therapeutic trials."
"9325573","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  Our goal is to develop inhibitors against a novel and unexploited target for the treatment of AIDS. The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HlV-1), the causative agent of AIDS, is a complex retrovirus that encodes six regulatory proteins, including Vif that is essential for viral replication in vivo. Despite remarkable medical advances, HlV-1 infections continue to rise throughout the world. Current anti-HIV-1 agents target mainly HlV-1 reverse transcriptase or protease. However, inhibitors used to target these enzymes have given rise to viral resistance and related toxic effects, creating a need for more potent and less toxic therapies against other viral targets. HIV-1 is a complex retrovirus that encodes 6 regulatory proteins, among which Vif is essential for in vivo viral replication. HIV-1 Vif protein targets an innate antiviral human DNA-editing enzyme, AP0BEC3G (A3G), which inhibits replication of retroviruses. Since HiV-1 Vif has no known cellular homologs, this protein represents an extremely attractive; yet unrealized, target for antiviral intervention. Over the last few years, in collaboration with Dr. Stevenson (Project 2) and Core B, we developed and employed high throughput screening (HTS) assays to identify small molecules that antagonize HIV-1 Vif function. We focused our efforts to characterize one of these lead molecules, RN-18, which inhibits HlV-1 replication only in the presence of A3G. Mechanistic studies revealed that RN-18 enhanced Vif degradation only in the presence of A3G, increased A3G incorporation into virions leading to less infectious viruses, and enhanced cytidine deamination of the viral genome. These studies provide the first evidence that the HIV-1 Vif-A3G axis is a valid target for developing small molecule-based new therapies for AIDS or for enhancing innate immunity against viruses. Based on our preliminary success to develop Vif antagonists as a new class of AIDS therapeutics, we plan to employ highly innovative, collaborative, and multidisciplinary approaches to accomplish our proposed goals. Our project has the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Structure activity relationship studies and validation of lead compounds. Specific Aim 2: Structure activity relationship studies, lead optimization, and validation of unexplored scaffolds of Vif antagonists. Specific Aim 3: (i) Mechanism of Vif inhibition. Experiments will be performed to understand the mechanism of Vif inhibitors at molecular level, (ii) In vivo evaluation of Vif inhibitors. During the course of pharmacology studies (Project 3 and core B), we will measure the drug concentrations in plasma and CNS of drug treated animals."
"9311485","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Understanding the molecular basis for how hosts defend against viruses is an essential requirement for future development of antiviral therapeutics. Members of the poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) family display hallmarks typical of antiviral defense proteins including interferon-inducibility, accelerated evolution, and the ability to inhibit virus infection. A defining feature of PARPs is the enzymatic activity of ADP-ribosylation. Despite the imperative for understanding the mechanisms of the antiviral response, there is almost nothing known about what activates PARP enzymatic activity during the antiviral response, nor how this activity promotes an antiviral state. There is a critical need to fill in this gap because understanding the PARP- mediated antiviral response opens up new strategies of pharmacological intervention for cytokine-driven and viral diseases. Our long-term goal is to define the mechanisms by which viral and host non-protein-coding-RNA (ncRNA) regulates virus infection and disease. Consistent with this goal, our overall objective here is to determine how RNase L, a canonical component of the antiviral response, performs the newly described activity of generating ncRNA that induces PARP activity and how this increased PARP activity is antiviral. Our central hypothesis is that ncRNA generated by RNase L activity increases PARP activity and creates a heightened antiviral state by post-transcriptional mechanisms. Our hypothesis is formulated on our preliminary data demonstrating that RNase L activity is both necessary and sufficient to induce a diffusible PARP- dependent antiviral factor. The rationale for this proposed research is that understanding how RNase L products activate antiviral PARPs may identify critical new targets for cytokine-driven and viral diseases, as well as improve our overall understanding of three established/emerging areas of the antiviral response: RNase L, ncRNA biology and PARPs. We plan to test our central hypothesis and complete the objectives outlined in this proposal via the following two specific aims: 1) Determine how RNase L induces antiviral ADP-ribosylation, and 2) Determine how PARP activity creates an antiviral state. Our contribution here is expected to be a detailed understanding of how ADP-ribosylation is generated by RNase L-product ncRNA and how this contributes to the antiviral response. This contribution will be significant because it is expected to have translational importance in the prevention and treatment of a range of cytokine-driven diseases. The research proposed in this application is innovative, in our opinion, because it represents a new and substantive departure from the status quo by focusing on the modulation of PARP activity as a means to alter antiviral response and cytokine levels."
"9411614","Project Summary  Racial disparities exist in cognitive aging, and it has been established that long-term HIV disease accelerates cognitive aging processes. African Americans (AAs) are a particularly vulnerable group, and our preliminary data indicate that HIV+ AAs demonstrate worse cognitive and brain imaging outcomes than HIV+ EAs even after controlling for confounding factors. We do not know if these disparities persist over time, and the reasons for racial disparities in cognitive outcomes remains unclear. It is well-known that lifetime exposure to stress, which is associated with HIV-infection and AA race, influences cognitive outcomes. Thus, we hypothesize that lifetime stress is a mechanism that places HIV+ AAs at risk for poor cognitive outcomes. Peripheral inflammation has been linked to cognitive impairment in several studies, and is increased in association with HIV, AA race, and lifetime stress. Prospective studies are needed to determine if HIV, lifetime stress exposure and AA race results in premature cognitive aging via increased inflammation. The present study will address this gap in knowledge by examining rates of change in cognitive function and cortical and subcortical brain structures in a cohort of 250 older adults (50+) with and without HIV infection stratified by ethnicity (AA vs. EA). We will also address the gaps in the current stress and disparities literature by using a comprehensive measure of stress and adversity over the lifespan (i.e., Stress and Adversity Inventory [STRAIN]). The STRAIN will allow us to capture stressors that have occurred over an individual's lifetime as well as new stressors during the course of the study. We will examine how recent stress exposure is associated with changes in inflammation and cognitive/brain outcomes. This study is highly significant, as no study to date has examined racial disparities in risk for cognitive declines in HIV-seropositive individuals.  We will use state-of-the art methods for measuring brain changes by following up on a cohort of older (aged 50+) HIV+ and HIV- individuals from a previous NIH supported study. Structural neuroimaging will be used to examine longitudinal changes in morphometry and regional connectivity. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the prospective change in brain/cognitive function in HIV+ and HIV- adults stratified by AA and EA race. Our secondary aim is to determine how lifetime stress differs as a function of HIV status and race. Our third aim will examine how life stress is associated with prospective changes in cognition/brain structure. Finally, we will examine associations between recent life stress and changes in inflammation, and how these changes in inflammation influence cognitive/brain outcomes. This project brings together the skills of several research groups at UCLA, and builds upon existing collaborations and resources. To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study to evaluate cognitive aging in a large cohort of HIV+ and HIV- AA and EA older adults. At the end of this study we expect to discern the relative contributions of AA and HIV-specific processes as these unfold via inflammatory processes that increase vulnerability to premature aging."
"9339718","Epigenetics has become an area of growing interest for scientists, physicians, policymakers, and the public. Referring to molecular processes that alter gene expression without changing DNA sequence, epigenetics suggests that factors including diet, toxins, stress, trauma, and parental care may have lasting impacts on intergenerational health. These claims have brought renewed attention to the implications of epigenetics for understandings of health, disease, and individual responsibility. This K99/R00 Award is a five-year training and research project that will use qualitative and bioethical methods to address the social and ethical implications of epigenetics related to child health. The specific aims are: 1) to describe, based on in-depth interviews, how scientific investigators conceptualize epigenetic mechanisms and the implications these views have for understandings of genetic risks and responsibilities related to children's psychiatric, behavioral, and neurodevelopmental health; 2) to conduct 3 ethnographic case studies of community-based intervention programs where epigenetic findings are used to improve children's psychiatric, behavioral, and neurodevelopmental health; and 3) to perform normative analyses, based on findings from Aims 1 and 2, to identify the social and ethical implications of epigenetics in research and community settings. To date, no study has systematically investigated the conceptualizations and processes involved in the production, translation, and application of epigenetic findings related to child health. This study will be the first to collect and analyze empirical evidence to understand the perspectives of differently positioned stakeholders on this important public health issue. This evidence will be used to inform recommendations for the ethical conduct and translation of epigenetics across research, clinical, and community settings. The candidate will receive mentored training in genetics and epigenetics, bioethics, and quantitative methods to facilitate the research and career development goals of this project. The candidate's career goals are: 1) to develop a high-quality, independently funded research program exploring the influence of the genome sciences ? including epigenetics ? on contemporary conceptualizations of health, disease, and responsibility; 2) to generate empirical research that aids in better understanding the ethical and social implications of epigenetics; and 3) to inform future research and policy related to the implementation of epigenetic and genomic findings related to child health in research, clinical, and community settings. During the K99 phase of this project, the candidate's training will include coursework, directed readings, and the guidance of an accomplished, multidisciplinary mentor team with extensive experience supporting young investigators. This Award will allow the candidate to transition into an independent ELSI researcher with expertise in the empirical study of the implications of genomics and epigenetics for how we conceptualize and understand health, disease, and individual responsibility?an ELSI research priority in the area of Broader Societal Issues."
"9385918","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Cocaine use disorder (CUD) remains a significant public health concern that is resistant to current treatments and associated with neurobiological alterations impacting multiple cognitive functions. Challenges to treating CUD include an imbalance in neurofunctional systems that ?re-wire? the brain such that appetitive and habitual processes direct maladaptive decision-making and behavior. The proposed research aims to provide insight into this reorganized circuitry in CUD by investigating neurofunctional systems related to glutamate and functional brain networks.  The metabotropic glutamate 5 receptor (mGluR5) is a postsynaptic receptor involved in neuroplastic mechanisms, and associated with modulating the acquisition and persistence of addictive behavior in CUD. Studies of mGluR5 in CUD demonstrate a widespread reduction in availability during early abstinence; however, less is known regarding mGluR5 availability in current users, and relationships to reorganized brain circuitry underlying cognitive functioning. Resting-state and task-based (e.g., response inhibition) performance involve coordinated activity in known functional brain networks and alterations in connectivity patterns in CUD lend insight in a reorganization of circuitry (e.g., fronto-parietal systems) central to addictive behaviors. This application proposes to investigate the distribution of mGluR5 through PET imaging using the highly-selective radioligand [18F]FPEB (Aim 1), and functional network activity at resting-state and related to response inhibition using a Go/NoGo task during fMRI (Aim 2) in currently-using individuals with CUD and matched healthy comparison participants. Additional sophisticated analytics (e.g., independent component analysis) will be used to integrate these multi-modal data (Aim 3), providing novel insight into the relationship between these neurofunctional systems in CUD.  This program of research and training will integrate state-of-the-art biomedical imaging facilities at the Yale School of Medicine.

"9319270","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this Phase IIB application, we propose to commercialize and bring to market EyeArt, a fully automated, high throughput, retinal image analysis based diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening tool (which has been developed and already validated in bench tests on very large real-world data) by conducting formal clinical trials and integrating it into several clinical information systems. With its fully automated use, high throughput capability (can analyze several thousands of patient cases in just a few hours), scalable architecture, and ability to seamlessly integrate into clinical workflows, EyeArt will aid the expansion of DR screening and help bridge the exponentially growing disparity between the number of diabetic patients and the number of eye care providers. DR is a common microvascular complication of diabetes affecting 80% of all diabetic patients. Even though vision loss due to DR is preventable by early detection and treatment, it is the one of the leading global causes of preventable blindness primarily due to the lack of easy access to eye care providers. Automated DR screening is the only way to make DR screening more accessible to the large and growing population of diabetic patients, currently 29 million in the US and 387 million world-wide and expected to grow to 110 million and 592 million respectively by 2030.  To help reduce risk of DR vision loss in the diabetic population, EyeArt uses advanced image analysis algorithms to make DR screening more efficient, cost-effective, and more accessible. EyeArt has been validated and shown to have high screening sensitivity (safety) and efficacy on multiple large real-world datasets including one with over 54,000 patient cases (and 434,000 images) obtained from EyePACS, a DR telescreening system with over 360 sites in the US and elsewhere. Eyenuk has received ISO 13485 certification as a medical device manufacturer and EyeArt has received CE Marking and is commercially available in Europe. Going forward, we will clinically validate EyeArt in formal clinical trials and integrate it into clinical informatio systems to enable EyeArt's seamless incorporation into existing clinical workflows. This will pave the way for EyeArt's availability to the US DR screening market and reduce the burden on clinical resources by improving health care productivity. This will help increase the DR screening conformance in the diabetic population and thus help in reducing and ultimately eliminating vision loss due to DR through early detection and treatment."
"9323543","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Critical unanswered questions in the field of genome biology are how the dynamics of chromatin folding shape gene expression patterns. Our knowledge of the dynamics of higher-order 3-D folding of chromatin is severely limited, largely due to the lack of technologies to precisely image, engineer and monitor looping in a precise spatiotemporal manner across a population of cells. Here we propose to address these limitations by developing tools to dynamically alter chromatin folding in a synchronous manner across populations of cells as well as individual cells, and measure chromatin looping and its relationship to transcription at high spatial resolution in single cells. In Specific Aim 1 we will design tools to control looping dynamics. We will modify factors that fold chromatin at various levels, such as Ldb1 and CTCF by fusion to a moiety whose stability can be controlled by diffusible ligands. In combination with hi resolution 5C and single molecule imaging these tools are expected to generate fundamental insights into the relationship of nuclear architecture and gene expression mechanisms. In Specific Aim 2 we plan to engineer light-inducible systems for the precise control of looping dynamics. Using light activated dimerization domains that can be used in conjunction with designer DNA binding proteins we attempt to engineer factors used to rapidly promote or disrupt chromatin looping at various scales. This technology should enable studies not only in populations but also at the single cell level. In Specific Aim 3: we will develp reagents to study the transcriptional dynamics in relation to looping at the single cell level. We will combine RNA FISH with super-resolution imaging to develop a methodology for exploring the spatial and temporal structure of nascent transcription at high resolution. Combined with high-throughput image acquisition, we will discriminate the temporal dynamics of transcription by measuring the relative intensities arising from the different parts of the transcript. We will employ super-resolution imaging (STORM) to measure the spatial structure of transcription sites. These experiments are expected to reveal the impact of forced chromatin looping on distinct stages of the transcription cycle and elucidate the relationship between transcriptional burst kinetics and physical gene structure."

"9319271","Project Summary Generation of the eye, more so than many organs, requires precise control of its shape for optimal function. Obtaining knowledge of how the eye and lens is constructed during embryonic development is therefore important to help describe the nature of ocular abnormalities that lead to major structural defects or more subtle changes that alter vision. An example of a morphogenetic event required for the generation of organs is epithelial invagination. This process drives the inward bending of epithelia of several early organ systems including that of the lens placode during early ocular development. Although several mechanisms have been proposed to drive this process, such as apical constriction or local placodal growth, none have been found sufficient to account for epithelial bending. We have recently observed that placodal cells change shape, move, and generate cytoskeletal structures in a planar polarized manner that produces a net flow of cells toward the central placode. One of the hallmarks of planar-polarized cell movements such as these is the formation and resolution of cellular rosettes, an organized process of cell rearrangement that requires spatial restriction of junctional proteins that contract and shorten junctions and proteins that lengthen and stabilize cellular junctions. We have identified planar-polarized localization of proteins responsible for junctional contraction (Shroom3 and p120-catenin) and stabilization (Par3 and cdc42). These results led us to our central hypothesis that invagination is driven by a combination of epithelial cell movements and anisotropic cell shape changes organized by radial planar polarized protein localization, junction contraction, and junction elongation. We will test this central hypothesis with three aims utilizing live-fluorescent microscopy of genetically altered mouse embryos. In aim 1 we will characterize the role of anisotropic junctional contraction and analyze the consequences of combined deficiency of Shroom3 and p120 catenin. The goal of aim 2 is to characterize the role of Par3 in junction elongation during rosette resolution and invagination. Aim 3 will investigate whether anisotropic cell geometry and movement results from the mutual antagonism between proteins that induce junctional contraction and junctional elongation. Once completed, the experiments in this proposal will define the cell behaviors that drive the mechanisms of lens placode invagination."
"9317936","Project Summary/Abstract A central problem of immunobiology is to understand the adaptive immune response. The contraction process of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (Igh) locus is essential for subsequent VDJ joining event to generate antigen receptor diversity. To gain mechanistic understanding of this contraction process, we propose to develop novel computational methods to study spatial structures of the Igh locus before and after contraction. We will generate detailed 3D structural ensembles of chromatin chains of the locus based on looping interactions obtained from chromosome conformation capture carbon copy (5C) studies of the mouse embryonic ?broblast (MEF) cells and the primary pro-B (pro-B) lymphocytes. These 3D models of chromatin chains will satisfy fundamental polymer properties of self-avoidance and nuclear con?nement, will account for interactions derived from 5C studies, and can represent the population and possible heterogeneous subpopulations of the Igh locus. In addition, we will specify structural features de?ning the contraction process and identify critical genomic interactions.  Our speci?c aims are to (1) develop a computational method to generate large ensembles of 1056 3D chromatin chains of the Igh locus representative of cell populations and sub- populations before and after the locus contraction. We will ?rst develop a spatially con?ned random self-avoiding polymer model to exclude non-speci?c 3D looping interactions from 5C measurements. We will then develop a method to generate large ensembles of chromatin chains satisfying 5C-derived interactions that can represent the population and sub-populations of cells. We will then (2) specify common as well as differential 3D interaction patterns of genomic elements before and after con- traction, and identify critical 3D genomic interactions through computational knock-out studies. The outcome of our work will be a detailed structural picture of the spatial organization of the Igh locus during contraction, as well as a set of powerful computational tools for building 3D chromatin structures that can be applied to any genomic locus. 3"
"9236570","Abstract The fatal mutation in Huntington's disease (HD) leads to an expanded glutamine repeat within the huntingtin protein which causes neuronal dysfunction typically followed by selective neurodegeneration especially within the striatum and cortex. These dysfunctions in neurons and circuits occur during the development of the disease phenotype, well before there is significant cell loss. Recent studies in animal models have emphasized that synaptic cell-cell interactions play a role in the pathophysiology of this disease. For example, removing mutant huntingtin from the cerebral cortex ameliorates some HD symptoms. The experiments in this application are designed to understand the functional changes that occur in specific populations of cortical neurons during the progression of the HD phenotype and to uncover new targets and approaches for therapies. However, little is known about functional changes in cortical neurons, although these neurons also degenerate in HD. Before motor symptoms become apparent, sensory, cognitive and emotional disturbances occur and these seem to depend on aberrant communication in the cortex that probably involves thalamocortical pathways. These pathways have never been examined in HD. Our overarching hypothesis is that sensory and motor cortical areas are differentially and asynchronously affected during HD progression. We propose that sensory thalamocortical pathways are downregulated early leading to faulty integration and interpretation of sensory signals. In turn, the motor cortex becomes upregulated and disorganized, leading to altered corticostriatal communication and motor symptoms. In this grant proposal we will use state-of-the-art techniques in three different laboratories at UCLA. Aim 1 uses optogenetics and slice electrophysiology to examine mechanistically altered synaptic communication between thalamic sensory and motor nuclei and their corresponding cortical projection areas. Aim 2 uses high-density silicon microprobes to record firing of hundreds of neurons simultaneously in sensory and motor cortical areas as well as thalamic nuclei in awake mice. Aim 3 uses genetically encoded calcium indicators to visualize neuronal activity in sensory and motor cortical areas in awake mice. Together, the studies will provide new and important mechanistic insights into the understudied cortical dysfunction and will provide the basis for novel and rational treatments for HD by delineating more restricted targets spatially and temporally. These studies also will be relevant for understanding other CAG triplet repeat diseases and neurodegenerative disorders."

"9545932","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Trauma exposure is high in HIV-infected individuals both prior and subsequent to infection. The incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been reported to be between approximately 5% - 15% among the 30 million people living with HIV (PLWH). PTSD is a severely debilitating, stress-related psychiatric illness associated with intrusive and fearful memories as well as flashbacks, and nightmares of the traumatic event(s) for much of the victims' lives, and significant impairment in routine daily activities. Th challenges presented by PTSD are magnified in PLWH because PTSD leads to poor adherence to antiretroviral (ART) medications, increasing the odds of virologic failure. PTSD also increases sexual risk behaviors, increasing the risk of transmission. The neurobiology of PTSD has been a topic of intense study over the past two decades; however, there is minimal understanding of the neurobiology of PTSD within the context of HIV. Two systems that have been repeatedly documented to drive PTSD symptoms are the neural circuitry that underlies the startle response and the endocrine axis that controls the body's response to stress. Therefore, the current application will test the central hypothesis that HIV exacerbates PTSD symptoms and augments underlying neurobiological correlates of PTSD in women. One limitation to studying the interaction of trauma and PTSD with HIV is the high likelihood of trauma exposure within PLWH, making it difficult to identify a control group for rigorous experimental analysis. In order to address this previous limitation, the current work will compare the impact of similar levels of trauma exposure between PLWH and individuals at high risk for HIV. The population selected for this study will be recruited from the Atlanta site of the NIH-funded Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) which recruits from a population with overlapping recruitment for the NIH-funded Grady Trauma Project (GTP). The GTP has studied the impact of trauma exposure in a predominantly African American population for nearly 10 years focusing the proposed work on one of the most at-risk populations of PLWH, southern African-American women. The current project leverages the expertise in these two established studies and synergistically combines their individual areas of expertise positioning the generated body of work for maximum impact in the shortest amount of time possible. In the proposed project, we will examine the clinical, physiological, and neuroendocrine correlates of fear extinction as an intermediate phenotype of trauma-related symptoms. We will use dimensional approaches to symptom analyses (Aim 1), innovative biobehavioral assessments (Aim 2), and cutting-edge biomolecular techniques (Aim 3) in order to better understand the pathophysiology of PTSD co-morbid with HIV. The identification of the biological correlates of interactions among trauma processes and HIV infection has the potential to lead to better treatment approaches in terms of both pharmacological and behavioral interventions ultimately leading to improved ART adherence, reduced risk behaviors, and an enriched quality of life."
"9387161","Project Summary: Seizures recur in 50% of patients after temporal lobe epilepsy surgery and in 60%-70% after extra-temporal lobe epilepsy surgery. An exclusive focus on refining ?epilepsy localization? has not yet drastically improved seizure outcomes. We recently proposed that de-novo epileptogenesis in genetically predisposed patients may influence ?late? recurrences first manifesting after months to years of postoperative seizure-freedom. Evidence is accruing on neuro-inflammation's role in epilepsy, and genetic variation in Interleukin-1? (IL-1?) expression was linked to the risk of posttraumatic human epilepsy. We will explore the central hypothesis that genetic variability in IL- 1? and its related inflammasome translates into an altered pattern of microglial activation after epilepsy surgery, facilitating subsequent epileptogenesis in brain tissue at the edge of the resection and later seizure recurrence. Time to first seizure recurrence is our primary outcome. Spikes on 6-month postoperative EEG in patients who were seizure-free up to that point is our secondary outcome. In Specific Aim 1, we retrospectively explore the relationship between seizure outcomes and genetic variability in IL-1? and related inflammasome activation in resected epileptic brain tissue. We focus on SA1a)- the SNP) rs1143634 IL-1? gene variant ; and SA1b)- activation of the multi-protein complex controlling the synthesis of IL- 1? [the nucleotide binding and oligomerization domain like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3(NLRP3)inflammasome], as measured by RNA/protein extraction of inflammasome components and their immunohistochemical localization to microglia. In Specific Aim 2, we explore the relationship between MRI signatures of peri-operative neuroinflammation and postoperative epileptogenesis using brain MRI done in the University of Campinas 24-72 hours after surgery. In Specific Aim 3, we expand the questions of SA1 and 2 using a prospective cohort of 25 patients enrolled from Mayo Clinic and Cleveland Clinic as we (SA3a) determine if peri-operative serum measurements of IL-1?, MMP-9, or IL-18 correlate with the primary and secondary outcome, and identify the ideal collection time to study in a future definitive project; (SA3b) study the timeframe for development of our proposed postoperative epileptogenesis biomarkers; and (SA3c) explore our proposed mechanism by studying the relative (margin vs.core of resected epileptic tissue) degree of microglial activation, IL-1? tissue expression in those with favorable vs unfavorable outcomes. Our strong preliminary data support our hypothesis. The collaboration of multiple sites (Cleveland Clinic, Mayo Clinic, and University of Campinas) will indirectly test the feasibility and build infrastructure needed for a future definitive study. We take advantage of existing resources and a track record of productive collaborations among our investigators to optimize the efficiency of study conduct and ensure study completion. If successful, this work will open the door for an innovative line of research on surgical outcomes after epilepsy surgery with a significant potential for altering clinical care given the multitude of selective IL-1? modifiers on the market."
"9408850","The long-term goal of the proposed project is the development of a desktop circular array Small Animal Ultrasound Tomography System (SAUTS) to produce high-resolution cross-sectional diagnostic images of mice and other small laboratory animals. The SAUTS images will look familiar to the radiologist, resembling those produced by Micro-CT or MRI. They will be easy to interpret, as the circular tomographic approach alleviates most of the artifacts associated with conventional ultrasound images. The effects of the animal?s heartbeat, breathing, and motion on the image quality will be minimized by resorting to very high recording frame rates. The ability to map multiple elastic parameters, e.g. sound speed, reflectivity and attenuation can be used to fully characterize the biomechanical properties of internal organs and tumors. SAUTS will simplify the routine examination process. In some cases, it will be even possible to hold the animal by hand while pressing a foot pedal to take an instant image. To scan a set of multiple slices, a comfortable and stress-free mouse holder will be supplied. Compared to other cross sectional imaging modalities, SAUTS will be relatively inexpensive, portable, and suitable for daily repeated testing without harming animals and, as a result, eliminating any possible influence on the outcome of biomedical and pharmaceutical experiments being monitored. The proposed Phase I project has the following Specific Aims: (1) To prove the feasibility of in- house manufacturing of a ring array probe with embedded signal conditioning electronics and to test its performance on laboratory phantoms; (2) To develop a realistic top-level design of an affordable high-resolution imaging system. These Aims will be achieved by (a) designing, building, and optimizing a 16-channel segment of a low-noise ultrasound probe; (b) Assembling a 192-element circular array from segments and connecting it to the existing phased array controller; (c) Implementing data acquisition and image reconstruction software and verifying performance on phantoms; (d) Turning the ring array by small angular increments and compounding the data to study the expected resolution at higher channel counts; (d) Preparing Phase II development plan. Successful completion of these steps will allow building a practical SAUTS prototype with large channel count and high frame rate in Phase II. Once commercialized, SAUTS will be used in biomedical and pharmaceutical research labs to monitor anatomical changes in vascular, digestive, respiratory, reproductive, and other systems of small animals, including growth/shrinkage of tumors in response to new drugs and therapies."
"9309497","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Published work by the research team and data strongly suggest that prevalence rates and consequences of nonmedical prescription drug use (NMPDU) in older adults are increasing. That said, the specifics of NMPDU processes in this group are virtually unknown, with only three published studies that include older adults and examine NMPDU correlates. The long-term goal of the research team is to better understand nonmedical users and NMPDU processes (e.g., motives, diversion sources) across the lifespan, aiding intervention developers by identifying treatment targets and vulnerable subgroups of nonmedical users. In this application, using data from multiple years of the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), [the IMS National Prescription Audit and the NVSS Multiple Causes of Death files], the overall objectives are to: one, to better characterize older adult opioid, tranquilizer (primarily composed of benzodiazepines), [stimulant and sedative] NMPDU by establishing correlates, diversion sources, motives, and other key NMPDU indicators [and their relationships with NMPDU-related mortality]; two, to evaluate potential moderators in the NMPDU-correlate relationships, and factors (e.g., sex) associated with other NMPDU processes; and three, to establish latent classes of older adult nonmedical users of opioids, tranquilizers, [stimulants and sedatives]. Variable selection was guided by an adapted version of the Comprehensive Developmental Model of risk factors across different developmental periods, and all findings will be compared to those in younger cohorts, either directly in analyses or through comparison to previously published work. The rationale for this proposal is that better characterization of older adult NMPDU, including correlates, diversion sources, motives, and NMPDU subgroups will provide clearer targets for interventions to limit rates of NMPDU in older adults and the potential consequences of such nonmedical use. The contribution of this proposal will be significant because it will allow clinicians to identify older adult nonmedical users, particularly those who are most vulnerable to NMPDU-related consequences, and it will allow intervention developers to better craft robust prevention and treatment programs to limit and/or treat NMPDU in older adults. Furthermore, the research proposed here is innovative because it represents a significant departure from the current state of the field by applying accepted techniques and analyses, all previously utilized by the research team, to better characterize a vulnerable group of nonmedical users about whom very little is known, older adults. Other sources of innovation include the use of a nationally representative and large sample, inclusion of [multiple data sets and] a wide variety of NMPDU indicators to better characterize older adults engaged in NMPDU, and selection of analyses that examine sociodemographic and other developmentally-based moderators of key NMPDU processes. Rapid dissemination of the knowledge derived from this proposal has the potential to inform the development of maximally valid intervention options to prevent or reduce older adult NMPDU and its consequences, all of which is consistent with the mission of NIDA."
"9395334","ABSTRACT Self-renewing and multipotent intestinal stem cells (ISCs) support homeostatic and injury-induced regeneration of the intestinal epithelium. The mechanisms that regulate the functions of ISCs under such conditions remain poorly understood and represent a topic of great interest. Recently, increasing evidence supports a model whereby ISCs exist in one of two functional states. These include an actively cycling ?aISC? state which drives normal renewal of the differentiated and post- mitotic intestinal lineages during homeostasis, and a quiescent reserve ?rISC? state which can be mobilized under injury conditions to re-enter the cell cycle and repair damaged epithelium. The process through which ISCs interconvert between rISC and aISC states is called ?state-switching?, is proposed to be reversible, and is likely fundamental to how intestinal stem cells balance self-renewal with differentiation and mount adaptive responses to tissue injury. Our goal is to understanding the regulatory mechanisms that regulate ?state-switching? in ISC. Preliminary data from the Magness lab and others indicates that genetic loss of Sox9 in intestinal epithelium causes ISC to adopt a highly proliferative aISC-like state that is incapable of regeneration after damaging insults such as radiation. Further, our preliminary data indicate that the rISC state is associated with high levels of Sox9 expression, whereas aISC express low levels of Sox9. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that Sox9 is an intrinsic master regulator of ISC state-switching, and directs aISC-rISC interconversions through high and low Sox9-expression thresholds. To test this hypothesis, I will use in vivo genetic models and in vitro high throughput single-cell culture methods to assess the consequences of experimentally-controlled Sox9 levels on ISC proliferation, intestinal lineage allocation, and resistance to radiation, the latter of which is a defining property of ?reserve? stemness. The studies proposed here will test if and how Sox9 expression-thresholds diversify stem cell functions in ISCs."

"9383616","Abstract   The  molecular  mechanisms  that  control  stem  cell  renewal  and  tissue  fibrosis  remain  incompletely  understood. This program is our continuous effort to elucidate the role of extracellular matrix components and  innate  immune  receptors  in  regulating  lung  injury,  inflammation,  and  fibrosis.  Idiopathic  pulmonary  fibrosis  (IPF) is a fatal lung disease resulting, in part, from inadequate alveolar epithelial repair leading to detonation of  excessive  fibroblast  activity.  Our  laboratory  has  generated  a  body  of  work  during  the  last  founding  period  showing  that  glycosaminoglycan  hyaluronan  (HA)  and  innate  immune  receptor  TLR4  expressed  on  alveolar  epithelial  cells  and  macrophages  have  important  roles  in  regulating  lung  inflammation  and  fibrosis  in  the  context of noninfectious lung injury. HA is synthesized at the cell membrane by hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2).  We have discovered that HA expressed on the cell surface of lung epithelial cells serves a protective function  against noninfectious insults that is dependent upon TLR4. The new findings that lead us to forms the basis for  this  renewal  application  is  that  innate  immune  receptors  interact  with  endogenous  extracellular  matrix  to  promote alveolar progenitor cell renewal. During the past several years, our team has developed state-­of-­the-­ art  tools  to  target  both  Type  2  alveolar  epithelial  cells  (AEC2s)  in  the  context  of  noninfectious  lung  injury.  During  the  funding  period  of  this  award,  we  discovered  that  mice  deficient  in  either  TLR4  or  with  a  targeted  deletion  of  HAS2  in  AEC2s  are  enormously  sensitive  to  non-­infectious  lung  injury  and  develop  fulminant  interstitial fibrosis. AEC2s isolated from mice deficient in either TLR4 or with a targeted deletion of HAS2 show  reduced self-­renewal capacity. We show for the first time, that innate immune receptors interacting with matrix  are  necessary  for  lung  stem  cell  renewal  and  prevention  of  severe  fibrosis.  We  have  identified  IL-­6  as  a  putative  cytokine  mediator  released  by  AEC2s  in  a  manner  dependent  on  HA-­TLR4  interactions  promotes  stem  cell  renewal  and  modulates  lung  fibrosis.  Most  importantly,  we  have  found  that  there  is  a  significant  reduction of AEC2s from the lung of patients with IPF compared to the lung of healthy donors. AEC2s from the  IPF  lungs  showed  reduced  cell  surface  HA  and  impaired  renewal  capacity  relative  to  the  cells  from  healthy  lungs.  These  data  further  support  the  concept  that  IPF  is  a  disease  of  AEC2  failure  and  our  mouse  model  recapitulates  key  aspects  of  the  human  lung  fibrotic  disease.    Based  on  our  preliminary  studies,  we  have  generated the hypothesis that interactions between cell surface HA and its receptors are essential components  of AEC2 progenitor cell renewal and lung repair, and loss of these interactions results in severe lung fibrosis. In  this  proposal,  we  will  define  the  mechanisms  by  which  TLR4,  CD44,  NF-­k?B,  and  HAS2  in  AEC2s  promote  progenitor cell renewal and lung repair in mouse and human. Achievement of the goals of this application will  result in a completely novel approach to the treatment of lung diseases. "
"9208437","PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of our Program is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which HCMV regulates host signaling in CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) for the establishment and maintenance of viral latency and reactivation, and to determine how viral dysregulation of signaling contributes to HCMV myelosuppression. HCMV remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality via myelosuppression after solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation despite advances in diagnostics and therapeutics. HCMV latency is complex and the signaling mechanisms for establishment and maintenance of HCMV latency, as well as for reactivation of virus are poorly understood. Our program has identified a number of viral proteins and miRNAs that regulate both latency and hematopoiesis by targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and signaling pathways downstream of EGFR. The complexity of signaling events and approaches to comprehensively address questions on viral latency and hematopoiesis can only be achieved through a collaborative effort. Using state-of-the art in vitro models in primary, human CD34+ HPCs and in vivo models in mice humanized with bone marrow, liver and thymus, our Program will address the individual and combined roles of viral factors modulating host signaling. Our Project (Project 1) will address the roles of proteins encoded within the UL133/8 ?latency locus? in modulating host signaling. We have defined roles for the four genes encoded by the UL133/8 locus in either positively or negatively regulating the maintenance of viral latency. Intriguingly, these genes opposingly regulate the trafficking and activation of EGFR. We have shown that EGFR and downstream PI3K signaling is important for the maintenance of latency and inhibitors of EGFR or PI3K stimulate reactivation and replication. We hypothesize that EGFR is a critical signaling axis targeted by UL133/8 proteins to modulate viral latency, reactivation and hematopoiesis. In Aim 1, we will use a systems approach to define the global pathways regulated by UL133/8 proteins in the context of infection in CD34+ HPCs. We will then define the significance of UL133/8-modulation of host signaling to viral latency and reactivation in Aim 2 and to hematopoiesis in Aim 3. Throughout our studies we will integrate our data sets with those of the other Projects to determine how UL133/8 interfaces with other viral proteins (US28 in Project 3; UL7 in Project 4) and viral miRNAs (Project 2) and contributes to the broader regulation of host signaling in regulating latency, reactivation and hematopoiesis. Project 5, focused on defining the hematopoieitic signaling pathways targeted by HCMV, will inform our understanding of pathways targeted by UL133/8 proteins to regulate hematopoiesis. Collectively, our projects will provide the first comprehensive and mechanistic insights into the multi-faceted regulation of host signaling for the control of HCMV latency and myelosuppression. The network of viral factors we have identified uniquely position us to define novel host and viral targets for antiviral strategies to control HCMV latency, reactivation and myelosuppression.  "
"9283078","Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor, with a dismal prognosis. The poor prognosis is a direct result of the fact that potentially efficacious therapeutics cannot access all primary tumor and infiltrating GBM cells due to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) or blood-brain tumor barrier (BBTB). Our central hypothesis is that we can use novel high-frequency ultrasound (HIFU)-based techniques to remotely permeabilize the BBB and systemically delivery conventional chemotherapy and novel molecular targeted therapeutics to GBM, especially infiltrating cells that reside in predominantly normal brain. In addition to conventional HIFU techniques, we will use an innovative remote-controllable stem cell-based platform to allow us to non-invasively activate engineered stem cells to produce specific cytokines at the time and site of our choosing. To test these hypotheses, 2 specific aims will be performed: (Specific Aim 1) To demonstrate the feasibility of using image-guided HIFU remote activation to artificially induce TNF? and permeabilize the BBB and thereby allowing systemically administered therapeutics to access invasive GBM cells; (Specific Aim 2) To demonstrate anti-GBM efficacy of novel molecular targeted therapeutics after systemic infusion and HIFU- mediated BBB/BBTB focal permeability. Delivery of therapeutic agents through the BBB specifically to tumor cells but not to the surrounding normal brain tissue offers hope against GBM, an invariably fatal disease. Thus, this proposal has strong translational relevance."
"9355667","  PROJECT SUMMARY (OVERALL) The overarching purpose of the Rose F. Kennedy Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center (RFK IDDRC) is to improve the lives of children with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). Fifty years of distinguished progress in basic, translational and clinical research as one of NICHD's flagship IDDRCs, coupled with important recent faculty recruitments and an historic merger between the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and its University-Affiliated Hospital, Montefiore Medical Center, offer a solid platform for continuing excellence in our commitment to IDD research. The Center's 4 highly integrated and complemen- tary scientific Cores consist of: 1) our clinical translational core known as the Human Clinical Phenotyping (Core B, HCP), which serves to facilitate both access to and characterization of participants for IDD relevant research; 2) a Neurogenomics facility (Core C, NGEN) that provides cutting edge epigenetic and genomic processing and analyses on both human and animal tissues; 3) a Neural Cell Engineering and Imaging facility (Core D, NCEI) that provides state-of-the-art approaches to brain cell manipulation and visual-ization; and 4) an Animal Phenotyping facility (Core E, AP) for evaluation of animal behavior, metabolism, imaging and brain function in a manner with strong parallels to approaches taken in patients accessed through HCP. Each of our scientific Cores is carefully overseen and monitored by the Administrative Core (Core A, ADM), which also serves as the head ganglion of the entire IDDRC in its outreach programs to the Einstein/ Montefiore community as well as nationally. Each scientific Core is tightly connected to our selected Research Project which brings together a multidisciplinary team of investigators focused on intellectual disability in 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11.2DS). A central function of the RFK IDDRC is to promote the substantive links between Einstein research laboratories and clinics at the Children's Evaluation and Rehabilitation Center (CERC) Children's and the Hospital at Montefiore (CHAM). Together, this set of Cores and our research project form a dynamic network of IDD-focused programs and practices that interlink 19 different academic departments and 20-plus IDD-relevant clinics at Einstein and Montefiore. The latter include 22q11.2DS, Rett and Williams syndromes, tuberous sclerosis, neurofibromatosis, West syndrome and infantile spasms, autism spectrum disorders, and a wide range of lysosomal diseases. New initiatives being set in motion involve outcome assessments of premature birth in terms of IDD and newborn screening (NBS) and critical genotype/ phenotype issues in conditions of high relevance to such NBS programs in New York State (Krabbe disease and adrenoleukodystrophy). Strong outreach programs driven by our ADM core help spread the word about IDD research. Such efforts over the past 5 years have positioned the RFK IDDRC in a substantive leadership role in coupling research and clinical strategic goals across the newly merged Einstein-Montefiore community, and will play an essential role in promotion of new clinical-research partnerships going forward."
"9355193","?    DESCRIPTION:  Heart disease is the leading cause of death and morbidity in many countries in the developed world, including the United States. Due to the terminally differentiated and non-proliferative nature of cardiomyocytes, the heart is unable to regenerate and repair itself after infarction, and the resulting chronic cardiac dysfunction often leads to death within 5 years. Stem cell-based therapies involving the direct injection of cells into infarcted tissue have garnered much attention recently. However, while these therapies hold tremendous potential, the overwhelming cell death and limited ability of graft cells to integrate with the surrounding host tissue limit their effectiveness at restoring cardiac function. The goal of the proposed research is to develop injectable, three- dimensional myocardial matrix-graphene composite scaffolds that mimic the electrical, mechanical and biochemical environmental cues seen in healthy myocardium, and then to test their ability to generate functional tissues. The central hypothesis is that the high conductivity of graphene will enhance action potential propagation through direct and indirect (e.g. increased gap junction formation) mechanisms, thereby improving the functionality of the incorporated human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. By combining the unique characteristics of graphene and native myocardial matrices synergistically, we aim to create a new class of three-dimensional scaffolds for the engineering of cardiac tissues for therapeutic purposes. Towards this end, we will first develop biocompatible and injectable myocardial matrix-graphene 3D composite scaffolds with tunable electrical and mechanical properties. Then we will evaluate the capability of conductive 3D composite scaffolds in enhancing cardiomyocyte electrophysiological function in vitro."
"9286927","PROJECT SUMMARY Despite treatment improvements, leukemia-associated mortality is still unacceptably high, underscoring the need for better therapies. Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer that enables tumor cells to cope with the metabolic stress imposed by rapid proliferation, and represents an exciting new area of targeted therapy. Therefore, the identification and characterization of the altered metabolic pathways in leukemic cells could lead to novel therapeutic approaches. We recently identified dihydrolipoamide S-succinyltransferase (DLST) as a metabolic ?oncorequisite? enzyme critical for MYC-driven leukemogenesis. We have reported that MYC-dependent T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells reprogram metabolism by stabilizing DLST protein, and rely heavily on its elevated levels for proliferation and survival. Heterozygous loss of dlst in zebrafish significantly delays the onset of Myc-induced T-ALL that resembles a major subtype of human disease with poor prognosis. DLST is a transferase in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and mediates oxidative decarboxylation of ?-ketoglutarate (?-KG), which not only serves as the cycle intermediate for glutamine and glucose catabolism, but also an obligatory cofactor for ?-KG-dependent dioxygenases (?-KGDO) to promote their activities. Hence we hypothesize that: DLST protein stabilization in response to metabolic stress enhances the catabolism of glucose and glutamine, and suppresses ?-KGDO activities, thus promoting leukemic cell proliferation and survival. In Aim 1 of this application we will apply genetic, pharmacological and biochemical approaches to determine the mechanisms by which DLST is stabilized in MYC-overexpressing T-ALL cells and identify novel DLST interactors including its E3 ligase(s). The zebrafish T-ALL model will then be utilized to define the role of novel DLST interactors in T-ALL pathogenesis. In Aim 2, we will combine the analyses of the in vivo zebrafish model and human T-ALL cells to identify the biochemical pathways and molecular changes associated with DLST inactivation, as well as functionally characterize the role of DLST-relevant ?-KGDO in T-ALL pathogenesis. In Aim 3, we will investigate the compensatory pathways and targetability of DLST in relapsed or refractory T-ALL by using our newly identified DLST inhibitor and in vivo animal models including murine patient-derived xenografts. The innovation of this application lies in the study of DLST as a novel metabolic ?oncorequisite? enzyme in a physiologically relevant in vivo zebrafish system. Indeed, this innovative system has enabled us to identify MYC and AMP-activated protein kinase as potential regulators for DLST and isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 as its candidate compensatory gene. The significance of this application is that it will deepen our understanding of the reprogrammed metabolic pathways and oncogenic signaling in MYC-driven leukemogenesis, with the long-term goal of uncovering novel therapeutic strategies directed towards DLST-mediated metabolic dependencies in leukemic cells"
"9280418","OVERALL SUMMARY The long-term goal of this P01 is to develop next generation immunotherapy with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells and to translate this research into new therapies with curative potential for patients with blood cancer. The CAR developed at our center is now in international trials for refractory/relapsed pre-B cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). However, multiple myeloma (MM), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) remain as the major unmet medical need in blood cancers. Our central hypothesis is that therapies with combination of CAR T cells and universal CAR T cells created with CRISPR/Cas9 genetic editing will enable this powerful therapy to reach a broader spectrum of patients with blood cancer. We have brought together a cadre of exceptional investigators from multiple disciplines who have collaborated and published together for many years. Each disease-focused project will be led by a recognized authority in the field. To achieve our goals, we have developed three Projects, which will coordinately closely with essential shared resource cores. In Project 1, we will determine the clinical and immunological impact of treating patients on two clinical trials: (i) CAR T cells targeting CD19 and CD22 will be used to address the remaining unmet medical need in ALL, which is the emergence of CD19 escape variants; and (ii) universal CAR T cells targeting CD19 will be tested in patients with CLL to determine the role of T cell intrinsic resistance to therapy. In AML, the central problem in CAR T cell therapy is the lack of a known surface antigen that is present on AML but lacking from normal hematopoiesis. The goal of Project 2 is to open a wide therapeutic window by genetically modifying normal marrow to make it resistant to killing by anti-AML CAR T cells, and delivering potent anti- leukemic CAR T cells specific for CD33. In Project 3, the overall hypothesis is that anti-myeloma efficacy will be maximized by (i) combining CART-BCMA and CTL019 to eliminate both the dominant neoplastic PC population and rare myeloma-propagating B cells, and (ii) modifying CAR T cells to circumvent specific myeloma-induced T-cell-inhibitory mechanisms (i.e., immune checkpoints). The Cores for this P01 are essential for our progress including provision of project management for collaboration and biostatistics, clinical safety and monitoring, and fiscal support (Core A), a GMP facility for manufacture of cells and RNA (Core B), and a state-of-the-art platform for GLP analysis to provide high dimensional data of the samples generated in all Projects (Core C). The potential for paradigm shifting impact is to transform the lessons of CAR T for ALL into meaningful efficacy against all hematologic malignancies."
"9380682","The long term goal of this project is to identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms that give rise to the synaptic defects in Parkinson?s disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and variants of Alzheimer?s disease (AD) and to develop strategies for reversing them. A pathological hallmark of these diseases is aggregation of ?-synuclein throughout the neuron, including synapses. The synaptic aggregation of ?-synuclein is thought to be the cause of the cognitive deficits and dementia. While it is generally agreed that ?-synuclein accumulation at synapses impairs vesicle endocytosis, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Thus, at present, there are no known strategies for improving synaptic function in PD, DLB or AD because we don?t know the cellular or molecular targets. The proposed experiments take significant steps toward these goals by taking advantage of two classical vertebrate synapses that are ideally suited for studies on synaptic vesicle trafficking and by using both acute and genetic perturbations of ?-synuclein. The approach includes a combination of quantitative biochemical, electrophysiological, and imaging assays. One model for ?-synuclein toxicity suggests that it is initiated by formation of abnormal oligomers, while another proposes that build up of monomers is the trigger. Aim 1 will test predictions of both models at synapses by identifying how defined molecular species of ?-synuclein (monomers, dimers, higher molecular weight oligomers) affect vesicle trafficking and neurotransmission and the underlying mechanisms. Preliminary studies indicate that monomers and dimers produce distinct effects. Experiments in Aim 2 will determine the role for ?- synuclein self-association in producing synaptic defects by testing reagents that interfere with this process, including a drug with potential therapeutic value. Aim 3 is focused on reversing the synaptic defects caused by excess ?-synuclein by perturbing its association with Hsc70 chaperone protein, an idea that is supported by preliminary data. The experiments are innovative because they are the first to test the effects of defined molecular species of ?-synuclein at synapses, they continue the development of a new model synapse for these studies, and they will test several new reagents with potential for ameliorating the synaptic defects. The experiments are significant because they will elucidate the mechanisms by which excess??-synuclein causes synaptic deficits, and they will provide possible targeted, molecular strategies for improving synaptic function. Thus, these studies have direct implications for slowing or halting the neurodegeneration, cognitive deficits, and dementia in PD, DLB and other related diseases."

"9317548","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic pain continues to be a major public health concern with considerable effort directed towards achieving a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms to facilitate the development of more effective and safer therapeutics. The research in my lab focuses on the role of store-operated calcium channels (SOCCs) in the modulation of pain. SOC channels are composed of recently discovered Orai subunits (Orai1/2/3, pore-forming subunits), and stromal interaction molecules (STIM) 1 and STIM2 (the ER Ca2+ sensors, serve as their activators). Activation of SOCCs by the release of calcium from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) leads to sustained high levels of cytosolic Ca2+ that are required for many calcium-dependent cellular processes. In the central nervous system (CNS), SOC channels are known to influence neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity. Results from our current R21 grant have demonstrated that SOCCs are functionally expressed in dorsal horn neurons and their pharmacological properties are similar to those in non-excitable cells. We have identified STIM1 and Orai1 as essential components of SOCCs in dorsal horn neurons and have demonstrated that the knockdown of STIM1 and Orai1 proteins individually reduces spare nerve injury (SNI)-induced neuropathic pain. Recently, we found that the SOC inhibitor YM- 58483 not only attenuates neuropathic pain, but also dramatically diminishes inflammatory pain. Of interest is the finding that a SOCC inhibitor blocks NMDA and mGluR1/5 agonist- induced sustained calcium entry and nociceptive behavior at later time points, suggesting that SOCCs are involved in functions of NMDA receptors and mGluR1/5. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that SOCC involvement in pain is mediated by their interaction with NMDA receptors and mGluR1/5. To test this hypothesis, we will combine the methods of patch-clamp recording, calcium imaging recording, Western Blot analysis and behavioral testing. Overall, our long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms of chronic pain. The goals of this proposal are to identify endogenous upstream molecules of SOCC signaling and explore functional consequences of SOCC activation. These studies will extend our knowledge of how the SOCC signaling modulates pain. Our findings will establish functional links between SOCCs and group I mGluR, and between SOCCs and NMDA receptors. These studies will provide novel insights into mechanisms of pain and other CNS disorders and may suggest new approaches to therapeutic intervention."

"9334516","Intoxication from marijuana (MJ) impairs psychomotor performance and at least doubles the risk of motor vehicle accidents. The ongoing wave of legalization of MJ has brought increasing prevalence of driving while intoxicated with MJ. However, there is no quantitative biologic test that can accurately determine whether an individual is acutely impaired from MJ intoxication. Assays of the primary intoxicating substance in MJ, THC, in body fluids has a high false negative rate as THC is cleared from blood within 15 minutes, long before impairment is resolved. And assays of THC metabolites yield a high false positive rate because clearance of these metabolites can take weeks. Thus there is now no nor is there likely to ever be a test of blood, breath or body fluids that can accurately detect MJ intoxication. In response to this significant knowledge gap, this project aims to develop an accurate, portable method for detection of impairment due to MJ intoxication using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). fNIRS is a non-invasive, safe brain imaging technique that capitalizes on differences in the light absorption spectra of deoxygenated and oxygenated hemoglobin (Hb), that allows the measurement of relative changes in Hb concentration that reflect brain activity. fNIRS can be performed in natural environments at low cost, and thus can be used in real-world settings. In Phase I, we will develop an algorithm for individual-level detection of impairment from THC using fNIRS measurements. To do so, we will assess the effect of oral THC (or placebo) on fNIRS measurements, self-reported intoxication, and impairment as defined by the gold standard field sobriety test conducted by a Drug Recognition Expert (DRE) in 40 healthy MJ users. fNIRS assessments will examine (1) the effect of THC exposure on resting state and task-based activation in the prefrontal cortex, (2) the extent to which impairment in psychomotor functioning with THC administration correlates with THC-induced change in hemodynamic responses detected with fNIRS, and (3) the sensitivity and specificity and area under the ROC curve of fNIRS measurements and field sobriety test determinants of impairment. Milestone: Should machine learning applications to the data generate an algorithm that predicts impairment with >80% accuracy compared with a gold standard field sobriety test, we will proceed to Phase II. In Phase II, we will conduct fNIRS testing in 150 individuals under THC/placebo as in Phase I and in 50 individuals in a THC plus alcohol/placebo condition in order to further refine the algorithm for MJ impairment detection such that fNIRS detection concurs with field sobriety testing with >90% specificity. It is anticipated that this level of specificity could be used in legal definitions of impairment. This will warrant commercialization, which will be followed by prototype development and field testing. An accurate, quantitative, biological test that is user-friendly and enables law enforcement to detect impairment from MJ has the potential to dramatically change practice of law enforcement across the country and the world and thus has enormous commercial potential, as outlined in the Commercialization Plan and in accompanying letters of support."
"9326958","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco smoke exposure results in a significantly increased life-long risk for numerous inflammatory lung diseases. Fetal and neonatal exposure to tobacco is a major risk factor for chronic lung disease of prematurity, which affects an extremely vulnerable population, with an estimated burden of more than $2.5 B/yr. in the US. Epidemiological studies strongly support a causal association between smoking history and COPD, the third leading cause of death in the US and lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death for both men and women. Animal models and in vitro systems have been used, in combination with studies of human disease samples, to identify disease-associated pathways. Unfortunately, while the health risks of tobacco smoke exposure are widely-appreciated, there are no existing in vitro tests to ascertain risks associated with exposure burden or different type of tobacco products. We hypothesize that specific, reliable changes in gene expression can serve as biomarkers of tobacco smoke exposures that are accurate and predictive of human disease risk. The goal of this Project is to develop cell-based assays for specific disease-relevant gene expression signatures of cigarette smoke exposure. We propose three Specific Aims: The first Aim will survey genome-wide responses to tobacco smoke in vitro and ultimately result in a set of transcriptional biomarker sets which are accurate and predictive of human disease. The second Aim will define specific, physiological responses to inhaled smoke from a variety of tobacco types and doses within the lung, using a validated mouse model of smoke-induced lung disease. This Aim will also identify distinct responses in adults and more vulnerable juveniles and neonates. The third Aim will help to refine the set of biomarkers to focus upon whose dysregulation are observed in human lungs upon tobacco smoke exposure and/or in resulting disease states, and assess the predictive potential of those specific biomarkers. This project is highly responsive to the goals of the Program and will support the FDA mission to regulate tobacco products by developing multiple, disease-relevant, regulatory-appropriate assays that could be used by the FDA to quantitatively and qualitatively measure the adverse impact of tobacco smoke exposure."

We plan to take promising young trainees and jumpstart their academic careers by providing them with a multidisciplinary and mentored research exposure early in their training, with the broad long term goal of improving imaging detection, monitoring, and treatment of disease by producing a cadre of physicians who will become independent clinical scientific investigators and future leaders in academic biomedical imaging. That is, the overarching purpose of the program is to produce skilled academic radiologists by providing a facilitated transition between residency/fellowship and academic faculty positions in Radiology. Such individuals are crucial for the continued evolution of biomedical imaging. Radiologists are uniquely positioned to be the cornerstone in multidisciplinary biomedical research, but they can only fulfill this role if adequately trained, prepared, and skilled in building and developing interdisciplinary teams. In addition, we plan to give special attention to the recruitment and training of residents from under-represented minorities or with disabilities or other social, cultural, economic, or educational disadvantages, since OHSU recognizes the importance of diversity in enriching the institutional culture and fulfilling the wider-ranging mission of the campus. A relatively broad theme has been deliberately chosen for this program, so trainees can pursue any of a wide and flexible range of research options within the multiple areas encompassed by biomedical imaging. A broad theme also capitalizes on one of the core strengths of our institution, namely, the breadth and diversity of the research activities and interests at OHSU and the wide spectrum of available imaging facilities and resources. A common core training block of coursework in research methodology, biostatistics, and biomedical imaging tools will provide those entering the training program with a shared foundation of knowledge. Trainees are mentored in the ethics and methods of biomedical research, as well as in grant writing and other important career skills."
"9382600","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT My research program focuses on development and application of computational approaches to determine the relationship between RNA structure and function for all RNA transcripts, or the transcriptome. RNA structure plays key roles in almost every step of RNA synthesis and function, and has significant impacts on biological processes and human diseases. Recent high-throughput technologies have begun to revolutionize dissection of RNA structures at the transcriptome level (termed RNA structuromes). However, little is known of the relationship between RNA structure and function, largely because current computational approaches lack the capacity to fully utilize the available high-throughput datasets to reveal the characteristics and functions of RNA structuromes. To overcome these limitations, I am building a unique research program to develop novel computational approaches to characterize, analyze and interpret the function of RNA structuromes. Over the next five years, the goals of my research program are to comprehensively elucidate RNA structuromes and precisely predict the functions of RNA structure in RNA-protein interactions and control of translation of RNA into proteins. We will develop a novel analytic framework for inferring RNA structuromes that integrates available high-throughput datasets and enables analysis of in vivo RNA structures. We will use this framework for analyses using specific cellular model systems, including characterizing the diversity of specific RNA structures that regulate RNA-protein interactions in a human cancer cell line, and dissecting the roles of RNA structure in modulating interactions between RNA and proteins shown to be essential for translational regulation of stem cell self-renewal and early embryogenesis. We will validate our computational predictions by collaborating with experimental biologists with relevant expertise. In the immediate future we will apply our approaches to study the roles of RNA structure in human diseases by collaborating with biologists working on the mechanisms of human diseases, including neurological disorders and cancer. Successful development of our approaches will allow us, and the research community, to elucidate the logic from RNA structure to RNA function and reveal their contributions to the etiology of numerous seemingly intractable human diseases. The overall vision of my research program is to build our burgeoning network of collaborations with colleagues at academic medical centers and hospitals across the nation that will, in the future, enable me to incorporate our computational approaches (using RNA structurome analysis as a springboard) to advance our capacity to render more accurate clinical diagnoses and prognoses, and develop novel, more effective therapies."

"9541081","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This goal of this application is to support a Mentored Quantitative Research Career Development Award (K25) for the applicant, Jared Weis, Ph.D., in the field of cancer biology, modeling, and imaging. A career development plan has been developed that includes immersive advanced didactic coursework and laboratory training that is essential to build Dr. Weis's knowledge and skill in cancer biology, both basic science and translational. This career development plan will also build upon the essential skills required of an independent investigator: grant writing, mentoring, scientific review, and research ethics. During the training, Dr. Weis will acquire expertise in cancer cellular/molecular biology and translational research techniques. Combined with the applicant's previous formal training in biomedical engineering, including computational modeling and imaging sciences, this career development award will ensure transition into independent investigator status researching multi-scale cancer mechanobiology with a particular emphasis in mathematical oncology/computational modeling. A multidisciplinary committee of exceptional investigators in fields of breast cancer biology, mathematical modeling, biostatistics, cancer mechanobiology, and imaging science has been formed and will guide Dr. Weis's career development in cancer research. The proposed career development plan will provide protected time to gain valuable cancer biology research knowledge and experience and enable Dr. Weis to make important impacts in oncology early in his career as an independent investigator. In this application, the proposed work represents an innovative and highly significant approach that seeks to investigate the development and validation of a cohesive multi-scale biomechanical mathematical modeling approach to link the cellular level mechanobiology interactions between cancer cells and extracellular matrix that direct cancer cell proliferation, motility, and aggressiveness, with clinically relevant non-invasive imaging data. The approach utilizes innovative image-based methods for measuring mechanical stiffness combined with mathematical models of tumor cell growth and response to treatment. The specific aims reflect a comprehensive study that seeks to validate modeling approaches and quantitatively characterize the association between mechanics and cancer, integrating information derived from multiple length scales, from the cellular level to the macroscopic level and includes: in vitr cell culture studies (Aim 1), in vitro bioreactor studies (Aim 2), and in vivo pre-clinical cancer models (Aim 3). If successful, the methods described in this proposal will provide a sound biomechanical mathematical modeling framework that is initialized and constrained by clinically relevant non-invasive imaging (elastography and diffusion-weighted MRI) that parameterizes key cellular level information influenced by mechanical signaling. The parameterization is then utilized for efforts directed at predictive modeling of tumor growth and response to therapy, sensitive to tumor mechanics-induced aggressiveness."
"9356950","Project Summary ? Shared Resources Core The Shared Resources Core (P01 Core) supports two components that are important to all three projects. The first of these is the availability of a committed bioinformatics research scientist whose office is located on the 4th floor within the space shared by the three projects. The second part of the P01 Core is the sharing of common equipment, services, and materials in order to bring the three projects together and enable cost- effective use of funds. The bioinformatics component of the P01 Core has collaborated with the investigators in the three labs for the past 8 years, including the prior grant period, thus insuring an overall awareness of the context of experiments and the overall goals and strategy of the three projects. The primary goal of the P01 Core is to provide statistical, bio-statistical, high-performance computing, and algorithmic expertise to all three projects in support of their aims. This includes analysis of datasets from various high-throughput technologies, implementation of novel and customized solutions, user training in computational concepts, and results interpretation, among other things. The second component of the P01 Core focuses on the cost-effective sharing of resources and materials. The use of shared equipment promotes interaction between investigators on a daily basis, and is facilitated by the fact that all three labs occupy adjacent space on the same floor. All of the equipment supported by the P01 Core is housed in a shared space of 3,200 sq. ft.

"9455189","Abstract  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an incurable, chronic disease of the CNS that arises in young adulthood and precipitates severe disability by middle age. In MS, immune cells attack myelin in the CNS, leading to neuronal damage and loss of functionality. Currently available therapeutics are marred by incomplete efficacy and severe side effects, so there is significant need to develop novel interventions for MS. An emerging field that holds promise for the modulation of immune function as well as neuroprotection is therapy targeting the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Indeed, recent works have demonstrated that the ER is just not a protein synthesis and secretory organelle, but a central signaling hub.  Our proposal is centered on sigma-1 receptor (S1R), an ER-resident protein that makes an attractive novel MS drug target due to the fact that numerous S1R ligands are already in clinical use and are well tolerated, even with chronic dosing schedules. S1R ligands have been reported to possess neuroprotective properties, making them potentially able to halt the damage that occurs inevitably in MS, even with currently available treatments. We aim to expand the appreciated role of S1R beyond neuronal function. Our central hypothesis is that S1R is a key regulator of inflammation that acts through ER signaling. Guided by strong preliminary evidence, this hypothesis will be addressed by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Characterize inflammatory signaling in myeloid cells and CD4+ T cells lacking S1R and 2) Investigate effect of S1R expression on EAE severity. In the first aim, we will investigate the contribution of S1R to the inflammatory response of myeloid cells and T cells, which are two main cell types involved in MS pathology progression. We will also undertake mechanistic studies to understand how S1R influences the function of two central cell types in MS, helper T cells, macrophages and microglia, which will potentially reveal additional novel therapeutic approaches. In the second aim, we will test whether the deletion S1R affect the progression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and the cellular compartment relying the most on S1R function during EAE.  The proposed research is significant and innovative because it will test whether S1R represents a novel target for therapy development for patients with MS. Furthermore, the insights gained from our studies will lead to fundamental advances in understanding how the ER and S1R can influence inflammatory responses in MS and beyond."
"9378507","PROJECT SUMMARY Cancer survival rates are increasing dramatically as novel early diagnostics and new treatments emerge. However, there is a great cost in the form of acute and chronic pain that chemotherapy patients experience immediately after and for many years following successful treatment. As chemotherapy drugs travel throughout the body to target and destroy cancer cells, they severely damage other organs, including nerves, leading to a condition known as chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). Symptoms often appear minutes to hours after the treatment and include pain in the arms and hands, burning or tingling, loss of sensation to touch, difficulties in performing common routines, cramping, constipation, muscle weakness, and balance problems. The search for a treatment for CIPN is one of the major challenges in current oncology practice, with the identification of new agents to prevent and/or treat CIPN being a top priority and long-term objective. Unfortunately, no methods are currently available to assess the extent of CIPN or predict outcomes. Identification of specific biological mechanisms underlying the manifestation of painful CIPN requires a diagnostic tool to monitor CIPN in living subjects to identify a potential therapeutic target. It has been proposed that damaging radicals known as reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) cause nerve tissue injury and play a critical role in neurodegenerative diseases. To test this mechanism in living animals, we propose to investigate the spatial, temporal, and interventional aspects of the ROS response to chemotherapy in CIPN animal models and correlate the in vivo imaging results with disease progression. We will be focusing on the mechanism that is related to the burst of ROS, and the repetitive damage in the nerve tissue assessed by the proposed selected markers of chronic CIPN. In the Aim 1 we will first demonstrate that the repetitive stimulation of ROS pathway in mice leads to the symptoms associated with CIPN. After establishing this link, will demonstrate in Aim 2 that the other chemotherapy drugs such as paclitaxel and bortezomib that act with different cytotoxic mechanisms but show similar CIPN behavior follow the same mechanistic pathway. Finally, in Aim 3 we will test our hypothesis in syngeneic and patient-derived xenograft breast cancer models by demonstrating that pharmacological intervention using FDA-approved drugs will minimize ROS and chronic CIPN while not undercutting treatment efficacy. This strategy of combined imaging, histological, biochemical and behavioral methods will lead to identification of the molecular roots of chronic pain in living animals, providing mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of CIPN. Overall, the outline proposal will enable us to correlate the acute form with chronic CIPN and explore several image-guided strategies to minimize CIPN."
"9298406","The Jackson Laboratory Cancer Center (JAXCC) is undergoing a profound expansion of its  membership, driven by new cancer-focused leadership and the opening of the JAX Genomic Medicine  campus. Combined with the revitalization of the program at JAX Mammalian Genetics (Bar Harbor), the JAX  will more than triple the cancer-focused faculty. The recruitment of eight new members since January 2012,  when Dr. Liu became the JAXCC Director demonstrates the feasibility of this plan. The new JAXCC  members bring new cancer research and technological expertise and a strong translational research  capability to the Cancer Center. Institutional commitment to these new investigators is estimated at $19  million over the next five years.  Developmental funds are a crucial factor in assuring the JAXCC's continued growth and productivity. In  the previous grant cycle, new investigator funds were used to support seven junior faculty members. Funds  are requested for partial support of new investigators, which will be leveraged by significant institutional  commitment of funds. The strategic plan calls for the recruitment of 8 additional JAXCC members over the  next 5 years, with institutional commitment estimated at $22 million. The overall goals in recruiting to the  Cancer Center, determined in consultation with internal and external advisory committees include: 1)  expanding the focus on cancer systems biology and cancer genomics; 2) engaging translational sciences  that include cancer pharmacology/systems pharmacology, chemical biology, and molecular pathology to  enrich the basic science focus; and 3) strategically recruiting faculty who will strengthen orthogonal  approaches to cancer, such as experts in systems computational biology, and aging. The result will be a  cancer focus that comprises research focused on human genetics and genomics in Connecticut, tightly  integrated with mouse genomics expertise in Maine to model the complexity of the human cancer genome.  The pilot project program is an essential part of the plan to achieve the JAXCC's strategic goals.  Projects are awarded based on the quality of the science, their anticipated contribution to one or more  strategic goals, and the plan for securing federal funding, especially from NCI, for the mature project. In the  previous grant cycle, 12 proposals were funded, including 9 since 2012. CCSG ($156,556) and institutional  ($367,645) funds supported the project. In total, the funded projects support collaborations among 9 JAXCC  members and 8 external institutions. One publication has resulted and three are in preparation. Nine grant  proposals based on those pilots have been submitted to peer-reviewed agencies to date; 2 were awarded,  and 3 are under review.  An increase in funds is requested for expansion of the pilot project program, with at least a one to one  match from institutional funds. Projects that develop translational technologies that will move basic science  to clinical impact are of special priority. Oversight of the program has been strengthened. The Scientific  Executive Committee (SEC) sets the priorities for the annual proposal solicitation, works with applicants to  refine a research plan that achieves the strategic goal(s), approves awards, and provides scientific guidance  for the project's duration. Dr. Tennent, Associate Director for Research Administration, monitors progress of  each pilot toward stated milestones and tracks resulting grant and manuscript submissions."
"9353654","PROJECT ABSTRACT  In the United States, adolescent engagement in substance use behaviors (SUBs) contributes to the leading causes of disease and death among youth (Eaton et al., 2012). Adolescence is a critical developmental period for the initiation and onset of substance use disorders that result in pervasive health consequences (Mahalik et al., 2013)., The economic costs associated with underage drinking have been estimated at $68 billion per year and an approximated $14 billion in juvenile justice costs (CASA, 2009). Taken together, adolescent SUBs are a serious public health concern with pernicious personal and societal consequences. Adolescent risky decision-making studies suggest that increases in SUBs stem from significant maturational changes in brain function resulting in adolescents' hypersensitivity to rewarding outcomes (e.g., Casey et al., 2008). Work in adults has shown that responses to uncertainty (i.e., probability of receiving such rewards) are equally as important in guiding decisions (e.g., Huettel et al., 2006). A type of uncertainty that may be pertinent to real- world risky behaviors are situations of ambiguity, in which information regarding the probabilities of outcomes is partially to completely unknown (e.g., Hsu et al., 2005). Here, we seek to investigate individual differences in adolescent responses to ambiguity when making decisions, and whether these differences relate to SUBs.  An important factor in how adolescents respond to ambiguity may derive from subjective estimations of their chances of experiencing good or bad outcomes. Some studies have suggested that adolescents are biased in that they overestimate the likelihood of positive outcomes and underestimate negative ones, but research is limited (for review, see Reyna & Farley, 2006). Given that prevention efforts focus on educating adolescents on the consequences associated with risky behaviors, it is vital to understand how the adolescent brain perceives and updates beliefs about ambiguous outcomes. In addition, in order to create targeted methods by which unhealthy patterns of behavior can be prevented or changed, it is also important to understand the decision processes related to behaviors that protect against the adoption of SUBs. Engagement in protective behaviors (PBs) such as participation in structured team sports and extracurricular activities are related to positive health outcomes as well as decreased use of alcohol and other drugs (e.g.,Pate et al., 2000).  To address these gaps in the literature, I propose the following approach. First, I plan to computationally model adolescent preferences of uncertainty during an economic lottery choice task and investigate their neural underpinnings using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Second, using a novel paradigm, I plan to measure adolescent biases and errors in estimations of uncertain outcomes and associated neural responses. In using this approach, I aim to characterize behavioral and biological markers for early identification of at-risk adolescents that may inform interventions that foster PBs over SUBs."
"9518227","Epilepsy is the oldest known and most common serious, chronic neurological disorder that is characterized by recurrent seizures. It currently affects 65 million people worldwide, including 2.3 million adults and nearly 470,000 children in the United States. People with epilepsy suffer from seizure-related disabilities, depression and anxiety and have increased mortality compared to the general population. Over the last few decades there has been considerable effort and success to bringing new anti-seizure drugs to market. Despite the availability of several newer medications, approximately 30% of patients are treatment-resistant. Furthermore, anti-seizure drug therapies are associated with significant adverse effects and often require careful titration to achieve efficacy while minimizing disabling side effects. Neuronal potassium channels play a key role in regulating neuronal activities. Kv7.1-7.5 channels are one family of voltage-gated potassium channels critical in maintaining the resting membrane potential of excitable cells and neuronal Kv7 channels act to dampen repetitive firing of neurons. Additional interest in Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 channels come from the discovery of mutations in the Kv7.2 or Kv7.3 genes found to be associated with some inherited forms of epilepsy. Thus small molecule drugs that activate the opening of Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 channels have potential to treat many neuronal hyperexcitability disorders, including epilepsy. A recently approved anti-seizure drug, ezogabine, acts primarily by opening Kv7.2-7.5 channels with activity on the GABAA system as well. However, in addition to tolerability issues, ezogabine use has been associated with serious adverse effects that have limited its utility, including retinal and skin discoloration that are likely linked to ezogabine?s chemical instability rather than its Kv7 activities. The goal of this Knopp Biosciences program is to design and develop a Kv7.2/7.3 activator that fully realizes the potential of this target to address the unmet medical need of treatment-resistant epilepsy patients and difficult-to-treat generalized epilepsy syndromes. Such a compound will possess a dramatically improved tolerability and safety profile over that of ezogabine not only via improved intrinsic chemical stability characteristics, but also due to reduced Kv7.4 activity so as to avoid side effects that may be caused by opening Kv7.4 channels present in blood vessels and smooth muscle. In addition, the next generation Kv7.2/7.3 activator will remove activity on the GABAA channels. To accomplish this, Knopp has developed a variety of in vitro screening assays using Kv7-expressing cell lines and primary neurons. These data, along with those generated from a battery of in vitro assays testing for metabolism and drug-like properties, will be used to select compounds for study in acute and chronic animal models of epilepsy. We will also evaluate the tolerability of compounds in animals to identify drug candidates that show the best therapeutic window for efficacy with minimal side effects."
"9385893","PROJECT SUMMARY  Training Plan: This proposal describes a mentored 5-year research training program for the development of an independent investigator in analgesic mechanisms. The Principal Investigator is an Instructor of Anaesthesia at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and a faculty anesthesiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), with a background in cardiovascular physiology and anesthetic electrophysiology. His mentor, Dr. Emery N. Brown, is Warren M. Zapol Professor of Anaesthesia at HMS, Professor of Computational Neuroscience in the Dept. of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and Professor of Health Sciences and Technology at HMS and MIT. His Co-Mentor, Dr. Mao, is the Vice Chair for Research in the Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine at MGH and the Richard J. Kitz Professor of Anesthesia Research at HMS. He is a practicing board-certified anesthesiologist and Pain Medicine Specialist who currently directs both the Division of Pain as well as MGH's translational pain laboratory. With the Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award, the Principal Investigator will acquire new knowledge and skills in chronic pain models, systems neuroscience and translational research study design sufficient to develop an independent research program. He will take courses in the Dept. of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT, the Harvard School of Public Health and through the Harvard Catalyst and his research training will take place in laboratories at MGH and MIT. The long-term objective of this proposal is to prepare the Principal Investigator for a successful independent career studying analgesic mechanisms using a systems neuroscience approach.  Research Plan: The treatment of chronic pain remains a significant public health problem, which is compounded by the epidemic of opioid addiction and related overdose deaths. Neural dopamine (DA) circuits may be a promising target to produce analgesia, while also preventing opioid-induced side effects such as nausea, respiratory depression and sedation, but their role in pain is poorly understood. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that ?-amphetamine is equipotent to morphine in abolishing thermal hyperalgesia in a mouse model of inflammatory chronic pain, and that selective activation of DA neurons in the periaqueductal gray (PAG) produces analgesia. The goal of this project is to elucidate the role of dopaminergic analgesic circuits on descending pain inhibition. Using a combination of pharmacological and selective neural circuit modulation techniques, we will probe the behavioral, analgesic, and rewarding properties of PAG dopamine circuits in clinically significant mouse models of inflammatory pain. Understanding how dopamine modulating agents relieve pain may lead to effective new pain treatments."
"9332981","ABSTRACT CD8+ memory T cells are generated during primary infection with intracellular pathogens, such as viruses. These cells play an important role in the protection of the host upon re-infection with the same pathogen. In this study, we compare CD8+ memory T cell responses to both Influenza A virus (IAV), a recurrent virus that infects millions per year, and Epstein Barr Virus (EBV), a persistent virus which resides in 95% of the population. Using EBV seropositive, HLA-A2+, teenage (18 years old) and middle-age donors (30-50 years old), this study demonstrates memory inflation to EBV. CD8+ memory T cell responses to recurrent and persistent viruses change as an individual ages. We used tetramers and dextramers to study both cross-reactive and antigen specific cells that are present in whole blood and proliferate in response to stimulation with immuno-dominant epitopes of influenza and EBV. While the phenomenon of memory inflation has been described in the literature for another persistent virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), our data suggests memory inflation to EBV occurs in middle- aged donors. These data also suggests a role for cross-reactive responses, which differs between teenage and middle-aged donors and a narrowing of the T cell receptor (TCR) V beta repertoire occurs as an individual increases in age. This study further emphasizes the complexity of human T cell responses to viruses and the need for a better understanding of human T cell responses in order to design successful T cell inducing vaccines."

"9537829","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a shortage of physician-scientists who can bridge basic research and clinical neurosciences. These are the individuals who can take the discoveries of basic science and use them to understand the mechanisms of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease or stroke, and to develop novel treatments and biomarkers. Neuropathologists play a key role in this process, as they are specifically trained to study the microscopic and molecular manifestations of disease. They can provide critical insights into the changes present in human neural tissues, as well as those of animal models and based on their unique perspective can generate novel hypotheses or form an essential part of multidisciplinary teams studying neurological disease. The goal of the Johns Hopkins Research Education Program in Experimental Neuropathology is to provide neuropathology residents and fellows with an intensive, mentored research experience during their residency or fellowship. This early immersion in research will help them to develop a research career and prepare them to successfully apply for NIH career development awards (KO8 and K23). To attain this goal, we have assembled a group of highly qualified mentors, both from neuropathology and other neurosciences departments, who will guide the research activities of the trainees. These mentors are physician-scientists and basic researchers with strong track records of independent funding and research, scholarship, and previous training of physician-scientists. Trainees will be selected based on their potential for becoming independent investigators and will be admitted to the program while in their neuropathology residency or fellowship. The trainees will then work for one or two years in the laboratory of a mentor, who will guide and supervise them. The plan for research will be jointly developed by the trainee and mentor and approved by the Program Executive Committee. The trainees will also attend courses in the ethical conduct of research and professional development (grant writing). They will also be able to apply for an Administrative Supplement of the award to extend their research experience once they complete their clinical training. While in the program, the trainees will start writing applications for KO8 or K23 awards. The success of the program will be evaluated by the number of trainees that apply for and succeed in obtaining career development awards (i.e. KO8 and K23) or other major research grants (i.e. R01), pursue research and academic careers, and author significant peer-reviewed publications."
"9367750","IL-1 family cytokines are instrumental in orchestrating inflammatory and immune responses to infection. However, dysregulated IL-1 family cytokine signaling is a key contributor to numerous chronic inflammatory diseases and autoimmune disorders. IL-33, an IL-1 family member, is a potent inducer of allergic type 2 immunity. Like other IL-1 family cytokines, it positively impacts human health ? it activates a wide range of immune cells in response to microbial invasion, plays important roles in tissue homeostasis and repair, and reverses symptoms in mouse models of Alzheimer?s disease; but also drives negative impacts ? it promotes allergic asthma, participates in pathological fibrotic reactions, and is linked to autoimmunity. IL-33 functions by binding to its cognate receptor, ST2, and then recruiting its secondary receptor, IL-1RAcP. The latter receptor is shared by other IL-1 family cytokines, most notably IL-1. We have recently determined the X-ray crystal structure of the murine IL-33/ST2/IL-1RAcP signaling-competent ternary complex. Together with our preliminary mutagenesis, binding and functional analyses, these data suggest the hypothesis that the molecular mechanisms by which IL-33 and IL-1 recruit their shared secondary receptor, IL-1RAcP, differ markedly. This has important implications for the development of therapeutic molecules that can manipulate IL- 33 signaling, either to augment IL-33 activation to promote beneficial physiological effects or to inhibit IL-33 signaling to prevent adverse pathological effects. Our proposed studies are designed to fully demonstrate the differences in molecular mechanisms of IL-1 and IL-33 signaling and to leverage this growing mechanistic knowledge to engineer novel therapeutic activators and inhibitors of IL-33 signaling. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine the structural basis of IL-33 cytokine signaling complex formation. Having determined the crystal structure of the murine IL-33/ST2/IL-1RAcP ternary complex, we will now determine the structure of the human IL-33/ST2/IL-1RAcP ternary complex, which is directly relevant to our planned therapeutic designs. We will also evaluate the solution structures of these complexes by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and assess their conformational dynamics by hydrogen/deuterium exchange-mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) analysis and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In Specific Aim 2, we will define the molecular basis of shared receptor usage by IL-1 and IL-33. Using a structure-guided approach based on published structures of IL-1?/IL-1RI/IL- 1RAcP complexes and our new and forthcoming structures of IL-33/ST2/IL-1RAcP complexes, we will mutate residues within the interfaces formed by the composite cytokine/cognate receptor and accessory protein surfaces, and measure their binding affinities and signaling properties relative to the wild type proteins. In Specific Aim 3, we will develop novel therapeutics by rationally manipulating IL-33 signaling mechanisms. We will use a variety of directed evolution, structure-based protein design, and antibody engineering methods to produce specific and potent activators and inhibitors of IL-33 signaling."
"9347553","Project Summary Carbohydrate chains, known as glycans, are fundamental to a wide spectrum of biological processes, including anticoagulation, cell growth and development, cell-cell communication, immune recognition/response, and microbial pathogenesis. Glycans also feature prominently in human disease. For example, glycans are commonly expressed at atypical levels on tumor cells and have been shown to regulate tumor proliferation, invasion, hematogenous metastasis, and angiogenesis. A better understanding of the role that glycans play in both health and disease could be achieved with a comprehensive set of affinity reagents that specifically recognize defined glycoforms. Unfortunately, the number of commercially available glycan-binding proteins such as antibodies or lectins is greatly eclipsed by the number of biologically important glycan epitopes (glycotopes), and there are no commercially available antibodies specific for N-glycan structures. One approach with the potential to bridge this technology deficit is the isolation of antibodies with exquisite specificity for distinct glycans or glycoconjugates such as glycoproteins and glycolipids. However, obtaining antibodies that recognize specific glycoforms can be challenging for a number of technical reasons, thereby limiting the pace at which new orthogonal antibody-glycotope pairs are developed. To address these challenges, the objective of this proposal is to create a robust, integrated pipeline for producing renewable, well-defined glycotopes and corresponding high-affinity glycan-recognizing antibodies (grAbs) in a rapid and routine manner. Under Specific Aim 1, specially engineered Escherichia coli cells along with a new bioenzymatic synthesis strategy will be used to produce 4 structurally uniform free reducing-end N-glycan structures. The resulting glycans will be used for direct selection and characterization of grAbs. A scalable method for discovering synthetic antibody fragments from phage-displayed combinatorial libraries will be adapted for parallel in vitro selections of antibodies against immobilized E. coli-derived glycotopes. Under Specific Aim 2, all isolated grAbs will be characterized using ELISA, surface plasmon resonance, and glycan microarrays to determine affinity and specificity for the targeted glycan structure. In addition, grAbs will be used to probe the temporal and spatial expression of authentic glycan signatures on the surfaces of cell lines or in the context of glycoproteins. Given its modularity and scalability, this grAb-glycotope pipeline has the potential to yield customized affinity reagents on a glycome-wide scale, providing a high-quality and easy to use toolkit for glycan analysis that will be broadly accessible to the laboratories of specialists and non-specialists alike."
"9348673","?Modified Project Summary/Abstract Section  The proposed research will be completed at Boston College as part of the R00 phase of the award. Emotion has complex effects on episodic memory, enhancing certain aspects of memory, such as item recognition, but not other forms of memory, such as memory for context. Yet, the mechanisms underlying these phenomena are poorly understood. In general, episodic memories depend on the integrity of neural structures within the medial temporal lobes, and these structures are connected with two distinct cortico-hippocampal systems. The amygdala?known to mediate emotion effects on memory? is differentially connected with these systems, leading to the proposal that emotional memory effects can be explained in terms of differential modulation of cortico-hippocampal systems. The proposed research will address these questions by using a combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and transcranial electrical stimulation (tES). These methods will allow investigation of how emotion influences activity in cortical and hippocampal regions and alters the oscillatory signatures of memory processes. During the mentored phase of the proposal, which was conducted at UC Davis with Drs. Charan Ranganath and Andrew Yonelinas, the candidate obtained new training in high-resolution fMRI and EEG/ tES. During the current independent phase of the proposal, the candidate will use these methods to test novel predictions about the roles of cortico-hippocampal systems and theta oscillations in driving emotional memory phenomena. The candidate will establish her research laboratory dedicated to the cognitive neuroscience of memory and its modulation by emotion. The research environment at Boston College is optimal for this work. Boston College has committed substantial resources to psychology research, offering facilities and resources within the department and access to world-class imaging facilities in the Boston area. Thus, the research plan builds on a strong foundation of training, and it will take place in an atmosphere conducive to productive research. The results will significantly advance current understanding of the neural mechanisms supporting arousal-mediated memory modulation."
"9319172","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):   The Northwestern University Transgenic and Targeted Mutagenesis Laboratory (TTML) is a shared resource designed to produce genetically engineered mice for research projects of investigators of the Robert H Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center (RHLCCC), Feinberg School of Medicine (FSM), Evanston campus, and Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago Research Center. The transgenic facility was initially founded at Northwestern University in 1989, as part of the Markey Program in Developmental Biology, to provide a resource for generating transgenic mice. Today, the facility has evolved into a well utilized laboratory that provides a broad range of services to NU investigators, including generation of transgenic mice, gene targeting of embryonic stem (ES) cells, generation of chimeric mice via ES cell microinjection into blastocysts, cryopreservation and recovery of mouse embryos/sperm, and rederivation of pathogen free mouse strains. In 2003, the facility was reorganized and expanded to include gene targeting services. Embryo cryopreservation and recovery, rederivation of mouse lines, and in vitro fertilization services were added in 2005. The embryo, and now sperm, cryopreservation and recovery services position NU and Cancer Center investigators to capitalize on emerging repositories of mutant mice generated around the world, most of which are stored as cryopreserved embryos. Innovative genome editing technologies have been introduced over the last 18 months. These technologies implore zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) and recombinase mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) mechanisms to create gene-specific modifications directly in the zygote via pronuclear microinjection. Cancer Center investigators save both monetary resources and time as these technologies eliminate the need for ES cell based gene targeting. The TTML provides the necessary infrastructure that allows most investigators access to transgenic technology that normally requires expensive microinjection equipment and highly skilled staff with expertise in microinjection, microsurgeries, embryo manipulation, animal husbandry, and ES cell culture. TTML staff provides consultation and guidance regarding transgenic and targeting vector design; appropriate screening strategies; DNA purification methods; breeding and analysis of transgenic founder and chimeric mice; and transgenic-related technologies. The oversight committee that governs the TTML meets at least twice a year and is comprised of a dynamic group of faculty with a wide range of transgenic-related expertise. They critically review facility data/progress and provide astute advice. Since the inclusion of the TTML as a resource within the Cancer Center in 1995, Cancer Center investigators have consistently been the primary group of NU investigators utilizing the TTML, emphasizing its pivotal role in the overall research mission of the RHLCCC."
"9542555","Project Summary The project goal is to understand the impact of pre-existing dengue virus immunity (both wildtype- and vaccine-derived) on subsequent Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy. Understanding the relationship between dengue immunity on subsequent ZIKV infection is important because it has been hypothesized that the unexpectedly high rate of adverse consequences associated with ZIKV infection during pregnancy may be the result of previous infection with one of the four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV). Primary infection with one of the four DENV serotypes is protective against secondary infection with the same serotype. Secondary infection with a different serotype can lead to enhanced disease due to cross-reactive antibodies facilitating enhanced viral replication and skewed immune responses. DENV and ZIKV are similar enough in the envelope protein (the major target of these enhancing antibodies) that ZIKV could theoretically function as a ?fifth? DENV serotype. This has been explored to some degree but the reports have been controversial with some groups reporting cross-protection, while others have reported the potential for enhanced disease. Critically, this has not been explored in the setting of pregnancy. Accordingly, through this NIH/NIAD R01 we will use our nonhuman primate model of ZIKV infection to evaluate whether the severity of maternal and fetal ZIKV infection during pregnancy are enhanced by previous exposure to DENV. There are two Specific Aims:  Specific Aim 1. Define the impact of prior DENV infection on the severity of maternal and fetal ZIKV infection in pregnant macaques.  Specific Aim 2. Define the impact of prior DENV vaccination on the severity of maternal and fetal ZIKV infection in pregnant macaques.  In these studies, we will contrast maternal viremia, immune responses, and fetal outcomes with those in DENV-naive individuals infected identically with ZIKV. Our strategy to induce DENV-specific immune responses includes exposure to both wildtype DENV and a leading DENV vaccine candidate- Sanofi Pasteur?s Dengvaxia®. These studies are critically important because 1) ZIKV is circulating in many locations where DENV is hyperendemic and 2) dengue vaccines currently are licensed for use or licensure is imminent in areas where ZIKV is circulating. Vaccination creates a scenario whereby a naive population will become DENV-immune. Whether immunization with Dengvaxia®, a tetravalent vaccine that provides simultaneous exposure to all four DENV serotypes, can lead to more severe ZIKV disease is unknown. The results from these experiments will provide important answers to an ep- idemiologically relevant question: is it safe to vaccinate against dengue where ZIKV also is co-en- demic?"
"9386119","Project Summary  Elaheh Rahbar, PhD is requesting 5 years of didactic quantitative training under the supervision of Drs. Carl Langefeld, Floyd Chilton, Charles McCall and D. Clark Files. Primary reasons for this early career transition award include: i) PI was hired as an Assistant Professor in the area of trauma research, ii) PI has not been formally trained in statistical genomics or lipid metabolism, and iii) the PI's inherent desire to understand and improve treatments for traumatic injuries and inflammatory morbidities following injury using mathematical modeling techniques. In this K25 quantitative mentored career development project, the PI proposes to develop sophisticated mathematical and statistical models that incorporate mixed and multi-level interactions between dietary and endogenous fatty acids and genetic, epigenetic and other physiologic markers to better understand how to attenuate the acute response to traumatic injuries. We have compiled a strong combination of didactic training, formal coursework, and mentorship to develop and validate a multi-factorial mathematical model of traumatic injuries. This includes training in statistical genomics, and lipid metabolism under the guidance of Drs. Langefeld and Chilton, respectively. Wake Forest provides an outstanding environment to pursue this research and career development award because of its encouraging interdisciplinary atmosphere.  Specifically, we will first evaluate the role of fatty acid metabolism and contribution of genetic/epigenetic variations within the fatty acid desaturase (FADS) gene cluster on changes in inflammation and coagulation in critically ill patients. Leveraging on previously collected bio-specimens and NIH funded clinical datasets (e.g. OMEGA trial; Glue Grant) we will also develop new integrated genomic models to assess the effect of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) interventions for the treatment of trauma. We hypothesize that specific variants within the FADS gene cluster (chromosome 11; 12-13q) play a critical role in regulating lipid and inflammatory responses to injuries and consequently are potentially responsible for the disparate findings. Furthermore, these genetic/epigenetic factors are possibly key players in regulating the response to dietary PUFA interventions, such as ?-3 PUFAs, in the critically ill. The novel multi-level statistical genomic models developed during this K25 will provide insight into the contribution of genetic/epigenetic variants within the FADS gene cluster on the interactive nature of inflammatory, thrombogenic and metabolic responses following an injury. The proposed research is significant because there is a general lack of appropriate quantitative methods to evaluate the dynamic responses to trauma and an under-appreciation for the role of genetic factors modulating the physiologic responses to injury. The approach is innovative, because it attempts to use mathematical and statistical genomic techniques to advance our knowledge of the pathophysiology of trauma. In summary, the proposed training and research plan will launch Dr. Rahbar's career as an independent R01- funded researcher and leader in precision medicine and nutri-genomics for acute trauma and critical care."
"9322342","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is a disabling and often fatal disease that affects all ages, but mostly in the elderly. Stroke incidence is expected to rise in the US as its population ages; therefore, its impact on public health and health resources utilization will continue to be significant. The Stroke Progress Review Group and NINDS have identified a need for a network of stroke clinical trials centers in order to prioritize and efficiently design nd conduct translational and exploratory early Phase I/II clinical trials and large Phase III clinical trials to identify and advance stroke treatments. The NINDS Stroke Trials Network is a multidisciplinary stroke research infrastructure that consists of a National Clinical Coordinating Center, a National Data Management Center (NDMC), and 25 Regional Coordinating Centers.  The NDMC's role is to establish a collaborative relationship with all parties involved in the Network and provide efficient and standardized central data management that yields high quality data and statistical support in the planning and execution of the stroke trials. To this en, the Data Coordination Unit (DCU) at the Medical University of South Carolina has developed a web-based comprehensive integrated data and project management system, WebDCU, that enables distributed data entry from the participating clinical sites with extensive data quality control and also provides the necessary tools to efficiently manage operational activities for multiple trials, while ensuring compliance with the NINDS Common Data Elements and FDA regulations. Using the WebDCU? system, we will develop, implement and maintain a central database that streamlines and maximizes efficiency in the management of data collection, processing, and monitoring of clinical, biomarker and neuroimaging data. In addition, the WebDCU will incorporate trial management information system that will provide full support for all study operational activities in the Stroke Trials Network. The Neuroimaging Core of the NDMC will create neuroimaging repository for the stroke trials. In collaboration with the study Principal Investigator and the other parties of the Stroke Trials Network, the DCU biostatistics faculty members will: contribute to the innovative and efficient protocol development (including study design and case report forms development); statistically monitor study progress; generate reports for the DSMB and the study teams; conduct interim and final analysis and dissemination of study results via presentations and publications; and create public use datasets for data sharing. Finally, as the Statistics and Data Management Center for the Neurological Emergencies Treatment Trials (NETT) Network, the DCU offers unique advantage of seamless collaboration between the NETT and Stroke Trials Networks."
"9387914","Innate immune signaling pathways are initiated when host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) recognize incoming microbes, resulting in the induction of cytokines and antiviral type-I interferons (IFN-I). These signaling pathways are regulated by different molecular processes, including the ubiquitin (Ub) system. The goal of this proposal is to use influenza virus (IAV), which causes serious seasonal epidemics, as a model system to study the role of poly-Ub chains in activation of novel PRRs. This knowledge will help design approaches to improve antiviral responses.  Ubiquitination of proteins is a post-translational modification process, which is critical in many cellular functions, including immunity. Ub has seven lysines, each of which can be conjugated by another Ub to form a poly-Ub chain. In general, proteins covalently attached to poly-Ub chains linked through lysine 48 (K48) of Ub are targeted for degradation by the proteasome, whereas protein modification with K63-linked poly-Ub chains has non-proteolytic activating functions. Unanchored poly-Ub chains that are not covalently attached to any protein have also been shown to activate kinases in innate immune signaling. To identify other cellular factors that may be regulated by non-covalent interactions with unanchored poly-Ub chains in vivo, we developed a novel approach to isolate unanchored poly-Ub chains from lungs of IAV-infected mice, and identified three RNA helicases that interact with these unanchored poly-Ub chains in vivo. Two helicases, DHX8 and DHX16, are known factors involved in pre-mRNA splicing, however whether they are involved in innate immunity or if their activity is regulated by unanchored poly-Ub is not known. Therefore, there is a gap in knowledge regarding the function of unanchored poly-Ub chains in regulation of mRNA splicing and innate immunity. In this proposal we will focus on DHX16. Our preliminary data suggest that DHX16 recognizes IAV RNA and that unanchored poly-Ub stimulates its ATPase activity. Therefore, our hypothesis is that DHX16 acts as a PRR for IAV RNA to induce antiviral innate immunity, and that unanchored K48 poly-Ub regulates its splicing activity and/or innate immune signaling. Since DHX16 localizes in the nucleus where IAV replicates, this would be the first example of a nuclear PRR and regulation of splicing by unanchored poly-Ub. In Aim 1, we will demonstrate that DHX16 acts as a PRR for IAV RNA and that unanchored poly-Ub regulates its function. We will identify the precise IAV RNA sequence that interacts with DHX16 and demonstrate that they interact directly, using in vitro and in vivo approaches. In Aim 2, we will determine the mechanism by which unanchored poly-Ub chains and IAV RNA regulate DHX16-mediated innate immune function and whether it depends on splicing or innate signaling. The outcome of our studies will elucidate a novel molecular mechanism of host defense against viruses using the Ub system and uncover a new mechanism of virus recognition by the host. This knowledge may be used to design approaches to improve antiviral responses."
"9375741","The human complement system is a tightly regulated set of ~30 serum or membrane-bound proteins which is best known for its role as a ?first-line-of-defense? against microbial intruders. A modern view places complement at the center of a number of important physiological processes including adaptive immunity crosstalk, developmental roles, and as a critical player in maintaining homeostasis. A large number of human autoimmune, inflammatory, and neurodegenerative diseases are now linked to the loss of the fine-tuned control of the complement cascade. Recently, the dysregulation of the classical complement pathway has been shown to play a causal role in murine models of Alzheimer?s disease. With 5 million Americans currently suffering from Alzheimer?s disease, and a predicted 14 million by 2050, development of new treatments is desperately needed. Unfortunately, the clinical pipeline of complement-directed drugs is currently inadequately positioned to produce therapies for classical pathway-driven neurodegenerative conditions. To meet this need, the fundamental goal of this project is to develop high quality, high specificity small molecule inhibitors of the classical complement pathway. The first component of complement, C1, is the multi-subunit zymogen of the classical pathway and consists a single molecule of C1q in complex with the serine protease heterotetramer C1r2C1s2. C1r is the initiator protease of the pathway and has the unique feature of requiring the molecular context of C1 to carry out its only known physiological function (i.e. activation of the classical pathway). In this project we will attempt to exploit this molecular provision by identifying C1r-binding small molecules which disrupt the stability of C1. To achieve this we will use fragment based drug design and natural product-inspired chemical libraries in combination with an surface plasmon resonance-based screening methodology. We will then implement a novel strategy to isolate compounds with high C1r-specificty and high complement inhibitory potential. Finally, x-ray crystallography will be used to reveal the binding mode of prioritized hit compounds. This project will provide the framework for structure-based drug design efforts for the development of novel complement-directed therapeutics for treatment of classical pathway-related human diseases such as Alzheimer?s disease."
"9366102","Project Summary Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease and is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques, composed of amyloid beta (A?) peptides. Current consensus is that the AD pathological process begins decades before clinical symptoms occur. Emerging evidence suggests that sleep disruption may be an important factor in both the cognitive deterioration of AD and in the progression of molecular factors, such as the metabolism of A? peptides, that promote ultimate plaque deposition and neurodegeneration. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common sleep disorder in the US and is thought to exert its pathogenic effects through some combination of sleep fragmentation (SF) and intermittent hypoxia (IH). A better understanding of the mechanisms by which sleep disruption impacts memory and risk for AD can stem from evaluating the role of disruption of specific sleep stages and, when such disruption occurs through OSA, from evaluating the individual contributions of SF and IH. We have strong preliminary evidence showing that the presence of OSA lowers the age at which individuals experience cognitive decline to mild cognitive impairment by 10 years, and subjects with OSA show the greatest increases in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of A? peptides when followed longtidinally. Furthermore, we have preliminary evidence linking decreases specifically in slow wave sleep (SWS) to both decreased overnight consolidtion of spatial navigational memory and increases in CSF levels of A?42. We have developed a novel model of sleep stage-specific induction of OSA through continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) withdrawal in subjects who have severe OSA and who are fully adherent to CPAP on a nightly basis. By limiting CPAP withdrawal to slow wave sleep (SWS) through real time EEG monitoring, we can recapitulate severe OSA in SWS only, with negligible OSA in other sleep stages. This model allows us to address a potential causal role for SWS disruption in the impairment of spatial navigational memory (Aim 1) and in increasing CSF concentrations of A? peptides (Aim 2). By providing supplemental oxygen during the CPAP withdrawal, we can create OSA in which sleep fragmentation continues to occur while IH is significantly minimized. This model will allow us to address a second major focus: to differentiate effects of SF and IH on spatial navigational memory (Aim 3) and regulation of CSF A? (Aim 4). To test these ideas, 85 adult subjects (age 25-70) will be recruited to perform brain imaging and ApoE genotyping and serial tests of spatial navigational memory, morning psychomotor vigilance, a lumbar puncture (LP) synchronized to their circadian rhythm (by actigraphy). Subjects will be tested in 3 conditions across different nights separated by at least 2 weeks: 1) CPAP held at the therapeutic value throughout 2) CPAP withdrawn exclusively in SWS and 3) CPAP withdrawn exclusively in SWS with simultaneous addition of supplemental oxygen."

"9349594","ABSTRACT  The basal ganglia circuitry ? including the primary input nucleus, the striatum ? critically regulates numerous behavioral processes and is implicated in the pathophysiology of multiple neuropsychiatric conditions, including Tourette syndrome (TS) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Regulation of the basal ganglia by the modulatory neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) has been extensively studied. Much less is known about the regulation of this circuitry by histamine (HA). Recent findings have highlighted the contribution of dysregulated HA modulation of the basal ganglia to neuropsychiatric disease, especially TS and OCD. A mutation in histidine decarboxylase (Hdc), the key biosynthetic enzyme required for HA production, was identified as a rare cause of TS and, with lower penetrance, of OCD. Our studies in Hdc knockout mice confirm that HA disruption can lead to TS-relevant behaviors and changes in striatal neurochemistry and function. Preliminary data from the mouse model focus attention on the histamine receptor H3R, which is highly expressed in the striatum.  Signaling by H3R in the basal ganglia is not well understood. Recent work, most of it ex vivo, has documented heterodimerization between H3R and both D1R and D2R dopamine receptors and shown that H3R and D1R interact in counterintuitive ways in the regulation of MAPK. Such heterodimerization of G- protein-coupled receptors is increasingly reported, but its functional significance has been difficult to pin down. We have replicated H3R-D1R functional interactions in vivo and identified a behavioral correlate. We have also identified a novel, cell-type specific effect of H3R on signaling through AKT-GSK3?: in striatal medium spiny neurons that express D1R (D1R-MSNs), H3R leads to phosphorylation (and thus inactivation) of GSK3?, while in D2R-MSNs it leads to GSK3? dephosphorylation. This differential regulation of both MAPK and GSK3? highlights the ability of H3R-DR functional interactions to modulate signaling and the importance of better understanding this dimension of striatal regulation.  We propose to use existing transgenic mouse lines to characterize functional interactions between H3R and dopamine receptors in D1R- and D2R-MSNs of the dorsal striatum. We predict nonlinear interactions in the regulation of both MAPK and GSK3?, and that these will lead to interactions in the regulation of locomotor activity. We will test the causal importance of H3Rs in specific striatal cell types by generating inducible H3R knockout mice, which we will cross with cell type-specific cre-expressing transgenic mice to produce D1R- and D2R-MSN-specific disruption of H3R signaling. We predict differential effects at the level of both signaling and behavior when H3R is disrupted in different MSN subtypes. These experiments will shed new light on the underappreciated role of HA in the modulation of basal ganglia function and lay the groundwork for future studies in animal models of pathophysiology."
"9316632","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of preventable blindness, and currently available treatments are not sufficient to halt progression in many patients. While much has been learned about the biology of glaucoma, development of new forms of treatment has been stymied by three barriers: high between-subject variability in ganglion cell number in normal eyes, high within-subject variability in patients with glaucoma, and the slow rate of progression of the disease. The proposed research integrates neural modeling and clinical research to develop improved methods for diagnosing glaucoma and for assessing progression towards blindness. The results are intended to improve measures for both clinical trials and ongoing patient care, while at the same time improving basic science understanding of the pathophysiology of glaucoma and providing guidance for biological studies of the disease process. Innovative uses of clinical devices will guide testing with custom systems, and statistical analyses will utilize the synergy between structural and functional measures of glaucomatous damage. High-resolution retinal imaging of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) will be performed on patients with glaucoma using a custom advanced adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmosope (AOSLO) as well as custom use of spectral domain ocular coherence tomography (SD-OCT). High-resolution perimetry will be performed in corresponding regions of the visual field, using custom stimuli that are resistant to optical artifacts that affet conventional perimetry. The results will be assessed with innovative statistical methods that utilize the synergy between perimetry and imaging measures. Specific Aim 1 will apply these methods to people free of eye disease, building three-dimensional models of RNFL that capture both structure and thickness, with the goal of using structure to overcome the barrier of high between-subject variability in ganglion cell number in normal eyes. Specific Aim 2 will focus on temporal retina, which has unique characteristics that make it possible to locate where retinal nerve fibers begin, starting with just a few axons. Temporal retina corresponds to nasal visual field, where visual field loss is common in early glaucoma, and the emphasis will be on detecting some of the earliest changes in a longitudinal study. Specific Aim 3 will focus on the macula, which is of great importance because it provides high-resolution vision used for many activities of daily living. The macula also has unique characteristics that make it possible to image the starting locations of retinal nerve fibers, and is well-suited for high-resolution perimetry. Specific Aim 4 will extend this approach to nasal retina, by examining patients with wedge RNFL defects that are narrow at the optic disc and then widen in a wedge of damaged RNFL. Whereas Specific Aims 2 & 3 address unique locations where RNFL fibers begin, Specific Aim 4 will address how to interpret RNFL defects across the rest of the retina."
"9260373","COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT CORE PROJECT SUMMARY Tribal communities throughout the West share a common problem: Metals mixtures are routinely released from thousands of abandoned uranium mines (AUMs) in short but intense rain storms and frequently strong winds, exposing the people who live nearby to uranium and other hazardous substances. We now know that these exposures increase risks of cardiovascular, renal and metabolic diseases leading to systemic immune dysfunction in some tribal populations. Since it will be at least another generation before AUMs are fully remediated under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), or Superfund, interim measures are needed to reduce exposures, lessen waste toxicity, and reduce health risks from compromised immunity. This is central purpose of the proposed University of New Mexico METALS (Metal Exposure Toxicity Assessment on Tribal Lands in the Southwest) Superfund Research Program. The Community Engagement Core (CEC) of the UNM METALS SRP will link the Pueblo of Laguna and two Navajo communities burdened by uranium wastes with UNM scientists examining ways to mitigate contaminant migration and understand how multiple-pathway exposures affect health, from the population level down to the cell where toxicity is manifest. Each of the communities is impacted by abandoned mines that represent the wide range of AUMs in the West -- from the relatively small mines on steep terrain in the mountainous Blue Gap-Tachee community of the Navajo Nation in northeastern Arizona, to the No. 1 and No. 3 highest-priority AUMs on the Navajo Nation near Gallup, NM, to the massive waste piles and pits at Jackpile- Paguate Mine, once the world?s largest open-pit mine, in west-central New Mexico. The Native people who live in close proximity to each of these sites have faced generations of chronic exposures but unable to move away because, as one Navajo woman said, ?we are culturally tied to the land.? Key personnel of the CEC have already forged long-standing, respectful relationships with each of these communities, and together we have made tangible gains in risk-awareness, risk-reduction and policy changes that have elevated the mine sites and the impacted communities on tribal and federal remediation priority lists. But much more needs to be done, and the CEC will respond to the needs of the communities by: (1) developing a common language and understanding of environmental health and traditional ecological knowledge among community members and researchers through joint CEC-Training Core training programs; (2) using community-based listening sessions to document community health concerns and research needs to direct prevention/intervention strategies that reduce exposures and mitigate or prevent toxicity; and (3) communicating research results to the impacted communities, and to tribal and federal agencies, including USEPA. Our research results will not only improve Superfund remedial decision-making, but also to raise the validity of indigenous perspectives on health in regulatory frameworks and have wide applicability to similar problems in other tribal communities in the West."

Methamphetamine (Meth) is a potent stimulant, which is highly abused in the USA, and associated with chronic systemic inflammation. Understanding the mechanism(s) by which Meth and HIV induce pathologies in the brain, whether and how chronic cART alters astrocyte/neuron function in the CNS, and whether Math (or other stimulants) affects cART, is critical for improving current, and developing new effective therapeutic strategies for treating Meth addiction and its comorbid conditions with HIV/AIDS. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is one of the key regulators of cognition and addiction; but it is profoundly altered following chronic Meth and HIV exposure in vivo with disrupted dopamine (DA) neurotransmission and immune activation of astrocytes. Both human and laboratory animal studies demonstrate that the mPFC dysregulation is significantly implicated in chronic Meth-induced brain dysfunction, associated with euphoria, craving, drug-taking and relapse. Cumulating evidence also indicates that both astrocytes and glutamatergic pyramidal neurons in the PFC are altered after chronic Meth or HIV exposure. Chronic Meth in vivo induces astrocytic and neuronal plasticity that differs from changes induced by acute Meth in vitro; but the underlying mechanism(s) of either one is not fully understood. In this proposed study, we will elucidate a novel, trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1)-mediated mechanism, by which acute Meth in vitro alters astrocyte activity; and determine alterations in this mechanism after Meth self-administration (Meth-SA) followed by a withdrawal (that elicits drug-seeking), in HIV-1 transgenic (Tg) or non-Tg rats. Moreover, we will also determine whether and how chronic cART in vivo affects functional activity of mPFC astrocytes and neurons; and whether such cART effects are altered by Meth-SA in the context of neuroHIV. Specifically, we will first define the mechanism by which chronic Meth in vivo alters astrocyte function (Aim1). We then will determine the mechanism by which Meth/HIV impacting on mPFC astrocytes/ neurons (Aim2). Finally, we will identify chronic effects of cART (using a fixed-dose combination of abacavir, dolutegravir and lamivudine) in vivo on mPFC astrocytes/neurons, and whether chronic Meth-SA alters them (Aim3). To prove the fundamental base of this proposed research, we provide justification, related citations, and preliminary data to support the Scientific Premise, Scientific Rigor, Relevant Biological Variables, and Resource Authentication for this proposal. Outcomes from the proposed research will reveal the novel, TAAR1- mediated mechanism that plays a key role in underlying the comorbid Meth/HIV impact, and chronic cART effects, on altering astrocytes and pyramidal neurons in the mPFC. This will advance our understanding for interactive effects of Meth, HIV and cART in the CNS, and therefore will induce a strong impact to the field."
"9346502","Abstract: HealthRhythms, Inc. Substantial evidence supports the idea that disruptions in the regularity of behavioral routines (or ?social rhythms?) can lead to the onset of psychiatric symptoms and full blown episodes via their impact on endogenous circadian rhythms and, conversely that stable social routines protect against new mood episodes. Based on our conviction that monitoring, evaluating, and increasing the regularity of behavioral rhythms has broad applicability for improving mental health, we established HealthRhythms, Inc. (www.healthrhythms.com) with the goal of using mobile technology to add the layer of mental health care to all of healthcare. Our product model capitalizes on the ubiquity and intimacy of smartphones and their capacity to sense parameters of behavior that represent key indicators of mental health on a 24/7 basis captured in the user?s natural environment, opposed to the sporadic, in-clinic measurement that has characterized mental healthcare to date. The product we envision will ultimately have three pillars: Rhythm Sensing, Rhythm Trending, and Rhythm Stabilization. The first two of these pillars have been developed and thousands of licenses for our product have already been sold. Building on our accomplishments to date, this SBIR Phase II Direct proposal extends our work in three ways: 1) further validating our existing technology, 2) developing the next stage of our technology and 3) expanding and improving our prediction models and demonstrating the cost-effectiveness of our technology. The Specific Aims are: Aim 1: Enhance our Rhythm Trending capabilities through intensive examination and analysis of data from the 3,000+ patients with whom our product has already been deployed. Aim 2: Develop the envisioned Rhythm Stabilization pillar of our technology. Aim 3: Expand the nature of the data included in our prediction models and demonstrate their utility."
"9254904","The epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) regulates Na+ absorption across many epithelia. In the airways of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, ENaC is abnormally hyperactive leading to disproportionate Na+ absorption and a depletion of airway surface liquid (ASL) volume. This contributes to mucus stasis and increased incidence of airway infections that frequently lead to the death of the patient. Surprisingly, there are no existing therapies to treat abnormal ENaC activity in the lung. However, biological control of ENaC is complex, and offers several opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Using a proteomic screen, we have identified the protein SPLUNC1 as a potent allosteric inhibitor of ENaC that binds extracellularly to ENaC, reducing the amount of ENaC in the plasma membrane and subsequently limiting ENaC activity. After identifying the ENaC-inhibitory domain of SPLUNC1 we have completed screening and lead selection of a peptide for clinical development. This peptide robustly inhibits ENaC and prevents ASL hyperabsorption in CF airway cultures for 24 h following a single dose. This peptide has completed animal toxicology and is being prepared for First Time in Human dosing. CF patients currently face significant treatment burdens with an average time spent on treatment activities of 108 minutes per day. If human efficacy studies prove the benefit of the therapy predicted by cell culture and animal models then the peptide will be a disease modifying therapy impacting mucus clearance, lung infection and lung capacity when administered as a chronic therapy.   To deliver these benefits to patients without adding to their treatment burden we seek to develop a dry powder inhaler (DPI) product presentation. We will demonstrate proof of concept for developing a DPI by: (i) evaluating the feasibility of spray drying our peptide to produce a respirable powder; and (ii) demonstrating the biological activity is not altered by spray drying. Completion of the proposed work will lead to a Phase II application that will be aimed at scaling the spray drying process and producing material for animal toxicology studies."
"9325053","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  The preovulatory LH surge stimulates an increase in ovarian extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN), which is known as a classic regulator o fthe matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The paramount role of EMMPRIN in ovulation is evident from experiments in mice lacking EMMPRIN that display a decrease in oocyte release and fertilization. Yet other than our preliminary data, nothing is known as to temporal expression patterns, the regulation, and potential function of EMMPRIN in the ovulatory process in  the human. This question will be addressed in the proposed POI program through a collaborative approach utilizing the exceptional backgrounds, technical expertise, and models ofthe PIs. We will make use of a unique model where the granulosa and theca from human periovulatory follicles will be collected prior to and at three designated times after hCG (early, late and postovulatory). The expression patterns of EMMPRIN in the human will be illuminated in Aim #1. Specific Aim #2 will build upon these findings to elucidate the role of EMMPRIN in ovarian angiogenesis in the human, macaque and rat. The ability of EMMPRIN to stimulate proliferation, migration and spouting of new vessels will be determined. To further characterize EMMPRIN's action. Specific Aim #3 will investigate the role of EMMPRIN in immune cell trafficking' Specifically, studies will explore the impact of EMMPRIN on leukocyte expression of the MMP system and EMMPRIN's ability to  regulate the invasive capacity of leukocytes. One novel aspect of this study is the use of well characterized human preovulatory follicles as a foundation to explore the expression and function of EMMPRIN in the process of human ovulation, which has never been accomplished. Another major strength of this proposal is the collaborative interactions between different investigators to address the function of EMMPRIN in periovulatory events across multiple species. As such the proposed studies are extremely timely to elucidate  the role that this exquisite proteolytic system plays in the coordinated processes of follicular rupture and oocyte release which are key aspects of normal human ovarian physiology."

"9356945","Project Summary ? Overall The three Projects in this P01 application, all strongly supported by the P01 Core, address overlapping research areas related to the central goals of the grant of characterizing pathways controlling cancer at the level of gene regulation. With the advent of powerful technologies to examine gene expression at the single cell level, it is becoming apparent that transcriptional states are much more dynamic and heterogeneous than previously believed. This is true of normal cells and, even more so, in cancer cells. The three Projects in this P01 address this question from a variety of perspectives and with complementary experimental systems. The product of this research is expected to be a greater understanding of how transcriptional heterogeneity governs the plasticity of cellular states, including differentiation states, as cells progress from normalcy to malignancy. In Project 1, the Jacks laboratory will explore this question in the context of tumor progression in mouse models of lung adenocarcinoma. These studies will examine how such heterogeneity evolves over time, what controls the observed changes and transcriptional networks as well as how immune responses to cancer affect these processes. The theme of transcriptional heterogeneity will also be explored by the Lees laboratory in Project 3 using the same model systems. Project 3 will focus on the effects of mutation of the PRC1 component Bmi1 in these processes. As part of Project 2, the Sharp laboratory will explore the role of miRNAs in the regulation of gene expression, with a focus on how miRNAs function to control patterns of gene expression at the single cell level and establish distinct cellular states. This research will inform the analysis of data generated in Projects 1 and 3. Dr. Aviv Regev (Broad Institute and MIT) is an important collaborator on the research related to this theme. The expert bioinformatics support provided by the P01 Core is also an essential component of this research effort. Project 2 will also explore novel models of gene expression involving gel-sol transitions at transcription start sites and enhancer element, which could help explain the dynamic nature of gene expression as well as other aspects of transcriptional control. A second theme of the Program is the examination of the development of cancer stem-like and niche-like cells as well as other effects on cellular differentiation during tumor progression. This theme will be pursued by both Projects 1 and 3. In addition to other aspects, the P01 Core will be essential for studies examining the relevance of these finding to human cancer. The final theme concerns the examination of the cellular and molecular effects of inhibition of the epigenetic regulator PRMT5, which functions as an argenine dimethylase of Sm proteins involved in mRNA splicing. Projects 2 and 3 will collaborate on the study of the biology and biochemistry of PRMT5 inhibition with the ultimate goal of developing new anti-cancer agents for the treatment of human cancers, including glioblastoma and lung cancer."
"9133116","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Emmetropization is a vision-dependent process that coordinates the growth of the eye such that the ocular axial length will align the retina with the focal plane to give clear, uncorrected vision. In humans, this process is far from perfect and can result in abnormal axial elongation of the eye, resulting in the development of myopia or nearsightedness. The chemical signals and mechanisms involved in visually guided eye growth remain largely unknown. Based on research in animal models, such as the chick and primate, choroidal all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) and retinaldehyde dehydrogenase (RALDH) have been implicated as playing a major role in the choroidal to scleral chemical cascade that modulates visually guided eye growth. Thus, the purpose of this project is to determine the role of choroidal  atRA and RALDH2 in mediating visually guided eye growth, as well as to begin to uncover the mechanism by which these molecules facilitate this process. The overall hypothesis for this project is that RALDH2 generated at RA in the choroid regulates scleral ECM remodeling during periods of visually guided eye growth. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: 1) determine the ocular target for choroidally generated atRA. In this aim, innovative ex-vivo imaging and biochemical approaches will be used to determine if choroidal atRA moves to other ocular tissues during visually guided eye growth. 2) Identify the RALDH isoform(s) that regulates atRA synthesis in the choroid. In this aim, choroidal levels of RALDH 1, 2, and 3 will be specifically depleted and the resulting effect on choroidal atRA synthesis measured. 3) Determine the effect of RALDH inhibition on ocular growth and refraction in vivo. In this aim, structure based drug design will be used to develop an inhibitor specific to the RALDH enzymes. This inhibitor will be used in an in vivo model to test the biochemical and physical effects of RALDH inhibition on ocular growth. The PI and her sponsor, Dr. Jody Summers, have assembled a team of co-sponsors and a collaborator that have the necessary tools and experience for the successful achievement of these aims. Completion of this project will shed light on the role of choroidal atRA and RALDH in visually guided eye growth and could lead to the development of these molecules as potential targets for the treatment of myopia."
"9387607","Project Summary/Abstract:  The Community Asthma Prevention Program (CAPP) has a two-decade history of utilizing CHWs to improve asthma outcomes of children in Philadelphia. Building on this foundation, we established a network of stakeholders, The West Philadelphia Asthma Care Collaborative (WEPACC), with representation from public housing, healthcare, community, and schools. As a result of assessment of local needs, resource mapping, and months of planning, we designed an asthma care implementation program with the broad objective of integrating home, school, healthcare system, and community for school-aged asthmatic children in West Philadelphia. We will accomplish this goal using CHWs to deliver sustainable patient-centered evidence- based interventions. The evidence-based interventions include (1) a primary care-based Yes We Can intervention with home visitation and (2) a comprehensive and rigorously evaluated school-based intervention, Open Airways for schools and School Based Asthma Therapy. CHWs will function as the hub of each interventions, serving either as primary care CHWs or school CHWs to provide a network of education, care coordination support, and to facilitate communication for families of children with asthma between the four sectors. This project is innovative in that it seeks to integrate interventions in a comprehensive and sustainable manner to reduce asthma disparities in poor, minority children.  Using a factorial design, we will recruit and randomize 600 asthmatic children (ages 6-12 years) from three inner-city primary care clinics who attend one of 23 West Philadelphia schools to one of four study conditions: both interventions (both primary care and school CHWs intervention), primary care CHW or school- CHW alone, or control and follow for one year. We will accomplish the following objectives: Specific Aim 1. Compare effectiveness of the primary care and school interventions to improve asthma control and reduce symptom days using main and simple effects from the factorial design. Specific Aim 2. Explore moderators and mechanisms of effectiveness and sustainability of the interventions. Specific Aim 3. Use mixed methods to explore implementation determinants and outcomes of school intervention that promote effectiveness, fidelity and sustainability Specific Aim 4. Examine the costs, savings, and cost effectiveness associated with the intervention and implementation strategies to promote sustainability 1"
"9318170","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   T cells have the powerful capability to survey and destroy cells that have become infected or transformed. T cells express T cell receptors (TCRs), which specifically recognize short peptide fragments bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on the cell surface. Various studies have shown that greater infiltration of T cells (tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, TILs) in a patient's tumor correlates with improved prognosis. If a peptide/MHC is recognized with sufficient affinity by the TCR, the T cell is activated and releases granzymes and perforins that destroy the host-cell. Despite potential for the normal immune system to survey and destroy transformed cells, established cancers have clearly avoided such immune-mediated recognition and destruction. An overarching goal of immunotherapy is to promote TCR recognition of cancer pepMHC complexes so that the body's own immune system can be harnessed to destroy transformed tissues. During oncogenesis, cells express mutated and aberrantly overexpressed proteins via MHC molecules. One mechanism to achieve T cell recognition of cancerous tissue is to engineer high-affinity TCRs to bind to these cancer pepMHC complexes. Over 300 pepMHC complexes associated with different types of cancerous tissue have been identified, yet very few high-affinity TCRs specific for these pepMHC complexes have been isolated. The goal of this project is to engineer high-affinity TCRs against several cancer pepMHC complexes and test their ability to promote tumor regression in adoptive T cell models of cancer. Also, this project seeks to develop a more efficient method for isolating high-affinity TCRs.  My specific aims are: Aim 1: To develop a high-affinity TCR against survivin/HLA-A2 using directed evolution and affinity maturation. Currently, we have isolated high-affinity TCRs against the cancer antigens Mart1 and WT1. Developing a high-affinity receptor against survivin will add to repertoire to receptors tested in other aims. Am 2: To test high-affinity TCRs in a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) format that will mediate T cell activity against Mart1, WT1 and Survivin antigens in vivo. This aim will allow a better understanding of how high-affinity TCRs can be used in vivo, so that future clinical development is possible. Aim 3: To develop a method for rapid isolation of high-affinity TCRs using a universal scaffold. Current techniques for isolating high-affinity TCRs are time-consuming, involving isolation of T cell clones followed by one-by-one manipulation of the TCR genes. This aim will develop an optimal scaffold library so that rapid isolation of high-affinity TCRs can be achieved, facilitating their use in adoptive T cell immunotherapies for diverse cancers and many more patients."
"9381203","Project Summary / Abstract Exposure to air pollution is an established risk factor for asthma, reduced lung function as well as inflammatory and oxidative processes which are in turn linked with obesity and diabetes. Risk for these adverse outcomes begins early in childhood and well-documented racial/ethnic differences and social disparities render minority children especially vulnerable, yet these populations are underrepresented in the literature. Analysis for truly representative effect estimates should consider a wide array of genetic, social and environmental factors, biologic pathways from exposure to disease, with consideration for causal mediators and interactions. Mediation and interaction analysis can also aid in determining the transportability of estimated effects from one population to another. However, estimation and interpretability of target parameters in mediation analysis is complicated by issues such as mediator-outcome interactions, non-linearities, and exposure-induced confounding, which cannot be addressed using traditional regression approaches. My long-term career goals are to assess optimal interventions on environmental health risk factors that best reduce overall risk in populations of interest. I will utilize advanced epidemiologic methods maximinzing internal validity and efficiency of estimation of target. I will expand on existing methods for estimation of effects in the presence of time varying exposures and covariates as well as exposure-induced mediator outcome confounding (estimation of controlled direct effects and the randomized intervention analogues for the natural direct and indirect effects) which cannot be addressed with traditional regression approaches. The proposed methodology will be suitable for assessment of potential interventions on continuous exposures, which will be especially beneficial in the area of environmental epidemiology. In Aims 1 & 2 of this proposal I will use these proposed methods to assess direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution exposures on risk of asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome, within a counterfactual framework. I am well suited to perform the proposed research based on 1) my past experience in environmental health and advanced methods and counterfactual approaches 2) the exceprional interdisciplinary mentoring team I have assembled and 3) the unique research opportunity offered by the datasets in the proposal, comprised largely of minority children. This proposed study will enable me to quantify mediated effects of air pollution exposures in especially vulnerable populations. I will be advised by a world-class team of mentors to expand my expertise in integrating advanced epidemiologic methods with causal inference applications (e.g., machine learning and efficient estimators of causal inference parameters) in environmental epidemiological studies; epigenetic and exposomic factors as potential modifiers or mediators of effect; and health disparities and social factors associated with environmental exposures. The proposed research and training will enable me to establish an independent career as a leader in intervention assessment and causal inference in environmental epidemiology."
"9409357","Project Summary/Abstract The overall goal of this proposal is to generate, maintain, and distribute a new collection of 1,500 custom engineered Drosophila melanogaster stocks that will allow versatile manipulation of genes that are highly conserved in humans but currently lack an available mutant allele. Utilizing cutting edge CRISPR technology, this collection or 'kit' will represent a powerful new set of tools that will benefit virtually all Drosophila geneticists; as such it is likely that there will be a high demand for this resource for many years to come. Many of the most important advances in our understanding of human development have come from studies using the fruit fly as an animal model system. Since many parallels exist between Drosophila and mammals in terms of the underlying molecular mechanisms controlling biological processes, knowledge gained from research in Drosophila can be either directly applied or readily adapted to understanding human biology and disease.  During Phase I of this project, we optimized the conditions for CRISPR/Cas9 mediated insertion of a custom CRIMIC cassette and correctly targeted 55 out of 63 genes attempted. This high rate of success (87%), indicates that we are perfectly poised to scale up our efforts to a larger set of genes. In this Phase II proposal, we aim to generate CRIMIC targeted alleles for an additional 1,500 conserved genes that currently lack an available mutant allele. The primary benefit of such a collection is that the CRIMIC insertion not only generates a strong loss-of-function or null allele of the targeted gene, but can also serve as a docking site for further engineering, such as transcript or protein tagging or creating point mutations that can be used to model human disease pathology. In coordination with other existing collections and the ongoing Gene Disruption Project (GDP), our Specific Aims are to: Aim 1. Select 1,800 gene targets and construct 1,800 gRNA/donor pairs Aim 2. Generate and validate a collection of 1,500 targeted gene stocks Aim 3. Create and maintain an online searchable database for targeted genes Harnessing the benefits of new technologies, this collection will fully complement existing collections and the ongoing GDP effort. Once generated, these combined resources will cover the vast majority genes in the Drosophila genome that are directly relevant to human disease."
"9306705","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Breastfeeding in the US has radically changed over the past two decades: feeding at the breast was once the norm, but now more than 85% of infants fed human milk are fed expressed milk from a bottle at least some of the time, and 5-7% of human-milk fed infants are never fed at the breast at all. Data from national surveys are routinely used to inform and evaluate breastfeeding promotion efforts at the national and local levels and are also the basis for research, but the questions currently in use in NCHS surveys no longer reflect contemporary infant feeding and lactation practices and result in significant measurement error. Our long-term goal is to contribute a new understanding of the impact of contemporary infant feeding and lactation practices on maternal and child health. Our objective here, which is the next step towards that goal, is to develop and evaluate a brief set of survey questions to accurately capture these practices among respondents. We will meet this objective by building on our prospective Moms2Moms study to survey mothers of children aged 0-5 years. Our objective was formulated based on our preliminary data revealing that up to 19% of children in our Moms2Moms study would have been misclassified as ?not breastfed? or had human milk feeding duration values that were under/overestimates of greater than 1 month if the NCHS questions had been used rather than our pilot survey questions. The rationale for the proposed project is to support future, high-quality research and public health surveillance of maternal and child health which use federal survey data. We plan to attain our objective by pursuing the following Specific Aims: 1) Develop and evaluate a concise set of survey questions about lactation and infant feeding that reflect contemporary practices, and 2) Ensure any recall bias imposed by our question set is equivalent to or less than the bias imposed by the questions currently used in NCHS surveys. The approach will include 3 phases: Pretest, Cross-sectional Field Test, and Comparison with Prospective Data. The proposed research is innovative because it will proactively address pitfalls by systematically pre-testing our question set before fielding with respondents, it will formally test our question set against the existing NCHS questions for direct comparison, and it will directly estimate recall bias by comparing responses to our question set to prospective data collected with the same respondents 4 years' previous. Through the research proposed in this application, we expect to contribute a new, concise, field-tested set of questions that may be used in NCHS surveys and also non-federal surveys. This contribution is significant because it will have a direct, positive impact on the quality of the data produced by these surveys, and thereby, a positive impact on the quality of research and surveillance efforts that rely on these data."
"9363671","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hantaviruses are the etiological agents of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). There are no FDA-approved medical countermeasures to prevent or treat these unpredictable zoonotic diseases. Recently, clinicians in Chile demonstrated that convalescent plasma from HPS survivors provided a clinical benefit in HPS patients in a compassionate-use study. However, the paucity of available human plasma containing high-titer neutralizing antibodies against hantaviruses, and other drawbacks to the use of human plasma derived products, makes the use of convalescent plasma as an anti- hantavirus product untenable. We propose to further develop a potent polyclonal antibody anti-hantavirus product using transchromosomal (Tc) bovine technology. This technology overcomes the significant challenges presented by therapies consisting of polyclonal antibodies obtained from human plasma donors or animal sources. SAB?s diversitAb? platform technology uses cattle carrying knockouts of key bovine antibody heavy light chains genes, and the addition of a Human Artificial Chromosome containing the entire human heavy chain locus and the entire human kappa light chain locus. As partners, SAB and the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) have already demonstrated that fully-human IgG purified from plasma collected from the Tc bovines immunized with hantavirus DNA vaccines has potent neutralizing antibody activity in vitro, and is protective in vivo (i.e., Syrian hamster models of lethal HPS disease). Here, we will use our existing hantavirus DNA vaccines and diversitAb? platform technology to produce a pan-hantavirus polyclonal antibody product under cGMP. We will conduct in vitro neutralization assays to measure potency, and in vivo efficacy studies using established Syrian hamster models of infection and disease. In addition, we will subject the candidate product to stability testing, human tissue cross reactivity testing, pharmacokinetic analysis in nonhuman primates, and a GLP preclinical toxicity study in rabbits. Our goal is to advance a lead candidate anti-hantavirus polyclonal antibody immunotherapeutic product through preclinical testing. At the conclusion of these IND-enabling studies, this candidate anti-hantavirus product will be ready for a Phase 1 clinical trial."

Here, we will build on our successes to develop new models and expand services to further expedite ADPKD research. Five aims are proposed: Aim 1: The core will continue to distribute high- quality, well-characterized primary cells and immortalized cell lines from inducible murine models of ADPKD. Tetracycline inducible Pkd1/2 KO kidney epithelial cells that provide a red-to-green switch to report Cre- mediated KO are a highlight. Aim 2: The core will offer genetically characterized cells from Human Kidney Cysts, with the goal of creating immortalized human cystic cell lines. A human ADPKD cyst biobank will also be formed in close collaboration with Clinical CORE E, providing an unprecedented opportunity to examine genotype-phenotype relationships. Aim 3 A novel 3-D kidney organoid culture system, derived from the renal epithelial cells of ADPKD mice (Animal Core, CORE C), is available to elucidate mechanisms of cystogenesis, and screen therapeutic agents. These organoids have inducible genetic recombination, allowing heterogeneous inactivation of the polycystins, similar to what occurs in the human disease. The system should provide an in vitro organ model where ?wild type? cells make tubes and ?mutant? cells reliably make cysts. Aim 4 CRISPR technology will be employed to create renal epithelial cells harboring specific ADPKD mutations in PKD1 or PKD2. Custom cell engineering is available upon request. Aim 5 The core will offer a Training Workshop in ADPKD Cell Culture Methods, consisting of didactic and hands-on training activities in the theory and practice of cell culture techniques for ADPKD research. We anticipate a high demand for our cells and services. They should accelerate progress and advance ADPKD science."
"9319170","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The Pathology Core Facility (PCF) is a centralized, comprehensive facility that provides professional expertise in pathology and human tissue-based studies and is specifically dedicated to the needs ofthe Cancer Center research community. The PCF has three main components: research histology, specimen procurement and protocol review. The research histology is composed of three units: routine histology, immunohistochemistry and molecular testing. This includes processing of fixed and frozen tissues, construction of hypothesis driven tissue microarrays, newly improved methods for TMA mapping and creation, sophisticated processes for the extraction of analytes such as RNA and DNA from samples, matched to end-point assay techniques. The research histology section also designs and validates the analytical assays, which include antibody selection and optimization for immunohistochemistry, a newly incorporated in situ hybridization for RNA and DNA with chromogenic and fluorescent detection. Adjoining to the research histology is microscopy, which provides pathologic verification of diagnoses, and quantitative interpretation of results, based on microscopic evaluation, including a new high-throughput digital slide scanner. An annotation and scribing software (Collibio?) allows for distant review, retention of data with image, and conferencing. The biobanking component ofthe PCF has two main functions: human tissue procurement, and quality assurance and protection of research subjects. The tissue procurement section serves to obtain, process, store and distribute characterized neoplastic and benign human tissue. Specimens are not only procured for specific protocols and laboratory projects, but also there is an organized systematic effort for generalized procurement and storage for short and long-term cancer research. PCF maintains a universal IRB consent for procurement of all specimen types. As a member of ISBER and NCI Group Banking Committee, the PCF uses new information, ideas, technology, and regulations in further developing a non-renewable high quality biospecimens resource to meet all aspects of cancer research. Lastly, the PCF reviews all clinical protocols which involve human tissue specimens. The PCF is CAP-accredited, CLIA high-complexity certified, and has the capability to serve integral marker studies, which require biomarker-based treatment arm assignment. The PCF staff are members of institutional review committees, and in this manner provide input and oversight ofthe clinical trial protocol design, and the specifics of tissue release of retrospective specimens. These activities allow for incorporation of pathology-specific competencies into the design and conduct of translational studies, and integrate the PCF into multidisciplinary teams that serves the entire Cancer Center research community. In addition, the PCF also runs the NCI funded ECOG-ACRIN Pathology Coordinating Office - Reference Laboratory, which serves as the centralized center for processing and distribution of biospecimens obtained from patients enrolled in ECOG and intergroup clinical trials."
"9356949","Project Summary ? Project 3 Epigenetic regulators play key roles in controlling transcriptional programs in normal homeostasis and in fate specification. These regulators are frequently altered in cancer and thus offer potential targets for chemotherapeutic treatment. Project 3 is investigating two epigenetic regulators, BMI1 and PRMT5, whose upregulation in lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD) and higher-grade glioma, including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), correlates with poor prognosis. Aim 1 focuses on BMI1, which acts as member of a polycomb repressor complex 1 (PRC1) to maintain the self-renewal capacity of adult stem cells and to regulate lineage choice in stem and progenitor cells. These observations suggest that BMI1 inhibition might effectively target cancer stem cells (CSCs). Using mouse models, Project 1 has shown that BMI1 inactivation at the time of tumor initiation greatly suppresses the progression of Kras:tp53 mutant LUAD, resulting in a significant extension of lifespan. Notably, K-ras mutations occur in approximately 30% of human LUAD and targeted therapies do not exist for these tumors. Thus, Bmi1 inhibition could offer a new strategy to target this disease. Experiments in Aim1 will determine the mechanism(s) by acute Bmi1 deletion impedes LUAD progression; in particular, they will test the hypothesis that this is caused by derepression of master differentiation regulators. Additionally, single tumor cell mRNA sequencing, in collaboration with Aviv Regev's laboratory, will determine how BMI1-deficiency alters the subpopulations of cells within Kras;tp53 LUAD especially the CSCs, complementing studies in Program 1. Final Aim 1 studies will model treatment of human disease by establishing whether acute Bmi1 deletion in existing autochthonous LUAD can achieve tumor suppression. Aim 2 investigates PRMT5, which accounts for the majority of symmetric dimethylation arginine (SDMA) modifications in vivo. In preliminary studies, Project 3 identified PRMT5 as the top hit in parallel in vivo and in vitro screens for glioma epigenetic regulators. Further analyses showed that suppression of PRMT5 by knockdown, or treatment with a PRMT5 inhibitor (PRMT5i) EPZ015666, caused cell cycle arrest and cellular senescence in GBM cells. This suppression correlates with widespread changes in expression levels, and also splicing alterations, which almost exclusively reflect elevated levels of detained introns (DIs). Aim 2 studies have two goals. First, they will identify the transcript changes associated with PRMT5i sensitivity and the core regulators that mediate these events, using a combination of gene expression analyses and a genome-wide dCas9-gene activation screen and complementing studies in Program 2. Second, they will directly address the therapeutic capacity of PRMT5i. A collaborative effort with Jun Qi's laboratory will generate PRMT5i with improved potency. Finally, since preliminary studies show that EPZ015666 effectively targets Kras;tp53 mutant LUAD cell lines, pre-clinical trials will assess the efficacy of PRMT5i in treating autochthonous LUAD tumors."

"9408738","Summary: The speed, resolution, and mass accuracy of modern mass spectrometers have revolutionized proteomics, but the accurate identification and quantification of post-translational modifications (PTMs) remain a major challenge that ultimately limits many current biomedical and pharmaceutical applications. A pivotal weakness lies in the almost exclusive use of collision-induced dissociation (CID) to induce fragmentation because most PTMs, such as phosphorylation, have labile bonds that are commonly lost in complex ways when subjected to CID. Furthermore, CID limits proteomics to bottom-up analyses of trypsin- digested peptides of 10-40 residues. It is well established that an alternative fragmentation methodology called electron capture dissociation (ECD) can produce exceptionally clean spectra that preserve PTMs, but this technique is currently feasible only in expensive FTICR mass spectrometers. Providing enough low- energy electrons to efficiently fragment peptides has, until now, fundamentally limited the application of ECD. We have developed an ECD cell that operates without affecting the ion-flight path of conventional mass spectrometers. Based on that new technology, our Phase I SBIR project was designed to at least double fragmentation efficiency by exploiting the distinctive geometry of Orbitrap mass spectrometers to enable ions to make two passes through the ECD cell. We exceeded our Phase I milestones by demonstrating that our ECD cell quadrupled efficiency, due in part to ions moving slower through our cell in the Orbitrap than in other types of mass spectrometers. We further showed that our ECD cell was easily installed in Orbitraps in an hour without affecting the instruments' performance. We established the ECD works particularly well for the analysis of native proteins, even for top-down hydrogen/deuterium structural analyses. For Phase II, our 1st aim is to refine each of the elements in the ECD cell to integrate easily in four Orbitrap family members and then to exploit the cell's capabilities to produce high-energy electrons to achieve stronger fragmentation by Electron-Induced Dissociation (EID). Our 2nd aim involves working with early-adopters to develop the technology for commercial release and validate its substantial advantages over competing technologies. Adoption of our technology will accelerate the ability of many NIH investigators to probe disease mechanisms and identify diagnostic/therapeutic biomarkers with increased speed and accuracy that will result in fewer mistaken identifications in complex biological samples. Our immediate commercial objective for Phase-III is to provide cost-effective upgrade kits for the 6,000 Orbitraps in service. The longer- range commercial goal is to develop fully integrated solutions that will enable the biopharmaceutical industry to characterize therapeutic protein products such as antibody-conjugated drugs, and to validate ?biosimilars? for the FDA and other regulatory agencies."
"9538444","Abstract: Many flaviviruses such as Dengue virus, Zika virus, West Nile virus, and Yellow Fever virus cause significant human diseases. However, no clinically approved antiviral therapy is available for treatment of flavivirus infections. Therefore, the development of vaccines and antiviral agents for prevention and treatment of flavivirus infections is a clear public health priority. During infection of the host cell, a single viral polyprotein is synthesized from the viral genome. This polyprotein is cleaved into its component proteins by a combination of host cell proteases and a two-component viral protease, encoded in genes NS2B and NS3. The function of this viral protease is indispensable for virus assembly and replication. The goal of this proposal is to develop high throughput screening strategies to identify and characterize compounds that orthosterically inhibit the function of the critical protease. In Specific Aims 1 and 2 we will develop and perform novel high-throughput screening assays capable of screening large chemical libraries to identify orthosteric inhibitors. In Specific Aim 3 we will evaluate the efficacy of the resulting candidate compounds for their capacity to block protease activity. Lead compounds against the protease will be tested for cellular toxicity, reduction of flavivirus titer in cell culture, and resistant variants. We will ultimately test the best lead compound toxicity and efficacy in live animals for the most potent compounds. This study will generate information on flavivirus inhibitor-enzyme interaction at structurally significant sites and potentially lead to novel classes of flaviviral inhibitors."
"9391816","Hypertension is a common and morbid complication of obesity. The pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in obesity-induced hypertension are not well elucidated. In this application we propose that (Pro)renin receptor (PRR), a newly discovered receptor, plays a major role in the development of obesity associated hypertension. Recent studies confirmed presence of this receptor in adipose tissue and kidneys. The lack of PRR specific antagonists and the lethality of its total deletion, made it difficult to study this receptor. Currently, the contribution of PRR to development of obesity-induced hypertension is unknown. In order to study PRR in adipose tissue and the kidney, this proposal will utilize two novel mouse models namely the inducible adipocyte specific PRR knockout mouse and the inducible nephron specific PRR knockout mouse. Our preliminary data demonstrated that obese mice developed hypertension with increased PRR expression and production of proinflammatory cytokines in adipose tissue and kidneys. These data also suggested that PRR regulates ?ENaC expression in the kidney. Based on these data, we propose that PRR contributes to development of obesity-induced hypertension by enhancing sodium retention. The long-term goal of our research program is to elucidate the novel mechanisms contributing to the regulation of PRR expression and function and evaluate its interaction with proinflammatory cytokines, angiotensin subtype AT1 receptor (AT1R), and ?ENaC in development of obesity-induced inflammation and hypertension. To achieve this goal, we will utilize a rationale and novel integrated approaches, including in vitro state-of-the-art cellular and molecular techniques, in vivo studies utilizing two novel inducible tissue specific PRR knockout mouse models, Laser Scanning Confocal FRET microscopy and in vivo microdialysis, to rigorously test the proposed hypothesis. Based on our preliminary data, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that PRR contributes to the development of obesity-induced hypertension via enhancing adipose tissue and kidney inflammation and PRR-AT1R dimer formation, leading to increased renal ?ENaC activity and sodium retention. We will pursue the following integrated specific aims: Specific Aim I: To test the hypothesis that adipocyte PRR contributes to the development of obesity-induced hypertension via enhancing adipocyte IL-1, IL-6, TNF?-renal ?ENaC pathway. Specific Aim II: To test the hypothesis that the nephron PRR contributes to the development of obesity- induced hypertension via enhancing PI3K-AKT-mTOR-SGK1-Nedd4-2-?-ENaC pathway. Specific Aim III: To test the hypothesis that PRR forms a heterodimer with angiotensin AT1R to enhance development of obesity-induced hypertension, via ERK-NF?B-proinflammatory cytokines-?ENaC pathway. These studies will identify novel pathophysiologic mechanisms related to obesity-induced hypertension and could lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies in treating this common problem."
"9332494","Abstract  We propose to design and test a lightweight iridium-electrode nitric oxide generator that provides medical grade NO gas from air and electricity, to serve as an economical, portable, battery-driven source of NO for ambulatory and home inhalation therapy. These features will make it feasible to conduct robust outpatient trials leading to a novel selective pulmonary vasodilator therapy for chronic lung disease and heart failure.  Inhaled NO produces pulmonary vasodilation without systemic vasodilation, which is a significant issue with other currently available therapies. In December 1999, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), approved inhaled NO for the treatment of hypoxic term or near-term infants with hypoxic respiratory failure (HRF) since which time inhaled NO has been a life-saving intervention for hospitalized infants to treat acute pulmonary hypertension. However tank-delivered NO is not practical for portable applications due to its weight and complexity of delivery. Our technology will enable inhaled NO as a portable therapy for these debilitating chronic diseases.  Our collaborators in the Zapol lab at MGH recently reported on data obtained from testing a 110V AC-powered bedside NO generating device in a lamb model of pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH). This prototype was subsequently tested in a human proof of concept (POC) trial in 6 healthy volunteers and to date 5 patients with PAH in the MGH catheterization lab. Third Pole and the Zapol lab have commenced work under NHLBI B-BIC/NCAI grant #U54HL119145 to optimize the electrode design of an NO generator for use with mechanical ventilators and anesthesia machines.  We will gather user requirements, test and develop a battery-powered portable iridium electrode inhaled NO generator with optimal materials and design to enable trials of safe long-term ambulatory inhalation therapy with NO."
"9280998","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Longterm goals of the proposed research are to understand the mechanisms that initiate development of mammalian cerebral cortex, and control formation of the neocortical area map. Findings should be relevant to a range of human disorders that stem from developmental defects in cerebral cortex. This proposal, which has three aims, is based on evidence that the signaling molecule Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) 8 acts as a graded morphogen in the embryonic mouse neocortical primordium (NP), and initiates a genetic cascade that leads to formation of the area map. Strikingly, ectopic FGF8 in the NP can induce duplicate areas, and even complex maps. Aim 1 is built on a previous, systematic search for candidate genes downstream of FGF8 and next in the cascade that leads to cortical regionalization. We used deep sequencing (RNA-Seq) to compare transcriptomes of NP tissue, exposed to different concentrations of FGF8 on different time schedules, mimicking the natural gradient of FGF8, and the natural timed exposure of NP to FGF8. We have identified several candidate genes downstream of FGF8 with regional expression in the NP and a link with embryonic patterning elsewhere. We will use mouse genetics and in utero microelectroporation for gene transfer into living mouse embryos to determine the role of the candiate genes in patterning the area map. Aim 2 will investigate how FGF8 interacts with FGF receptors (FGFRs), and how potential endogenous FGFR inhibitors and enhancers control the FGF8 grandient, and, consequently, development of the area map. Aim 3 will investigate the olfactory bulb primordium (OBP) as a promising model system for determining how bounded areas are established in embryonic cortex. The OBP is a distinct bounded domain long before any neocortical areas. We have evidence that FGF8 can induce a secondary OBP and will investigate FGF8 induction of the OBP further in this aim. The OBP is derived from tissue immediately adjacent to the areas of prefrontal cortex. Experiments will explore how these different cortical structures are separated from one another in development. Partial motivation for our experiments here are claims of a common link between olfactory deficits and schizophrenia and autism."
"9321618","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is the infection of the human nervous system by the larvae of the pork tapeworm Taenia solium. Subarachnoid neurocysticercosis (SANCC) accounts for 20-35% of all NCC cases. It is an aggressive, progressive and frequently lethal presentation of NCC, endemic in most non-Muslim developing countries. Unlike intraparenchymal disease (where the predominant manifestation is seizures and epilepsy, and parasites are located in the brain tissue), in subarachnoid disease the presence of the parasitic masses in the surroundings of the brain, their growth, and the concomitant inflammatory process lead to mass effect, intracranial hypertension and/or hydrocephalus, resulting in heavy morbidity and significant mortality which can be more than 20%. The response to antiparasitic treatment in SANCC is usually slow and partial, but if complete parasite resolution is obtained patients may be cured without further symptoms.  This application naturally expands the scope of and applies the knowledge obtained from a recent NINDS-funded trial on combined albendazole (ABZ) plus praziquantel (PZQ) treatment of intraparenchymal NCC [R01 NS054805]. The current treatment regimens for SANCC have quite limited efficacy and the disease is still associated with significant mortality in many places of te world. Combining ABZ and PZQ, along with appropriate steroid coverage and other safety measures, is the logical next step to improve the management of subarachnoid NCC and has not been examined before in a controlled trial.  In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, 164 patients with subarachnoid cysticercosis of the basal cisterns or the Sylvain fissure, will be assigned to either the standard of care anti- parasitic regime (30-day ABZ at 15 mg/k/d) or a combined regime adding PZQ at 50 mg/k/d for the initial 15 days of anti-parasitic treatment. The primary study endpoint is the proportion of patients with disappearance of their parasitic lesions in neuroimaging at six months after therapy onset. Secondary outcomes include the decrease in volume of parasitic masses measured by MRI at 3 and 6 months after treatment onset, clinical improvement evaluated as the proportion of patients asymptomatic and without need for further antiparasitic treatment 6 months post-treatment, the frequency of serious adverse events (SAE) of the combined regime compared to the standard of care, the decrease in the serum levels of circulating parasitic antigen at 3 and 6 months after treatment onset, and the proportion of patients whose lesions resolve and do not relapse by 12 months after treatment onset.  The trial will initially involve four centers: two in Peru, one in Brasil and one in Ecuador with the potential to expand to more centers if required. By comparing two active regimes, the proposed parallel group design permits open assessment of control neuroimaging scans for patient safety without affecting treatment blinding, and will provide the first data to support either therapeutic change or maintenance of the standard of care. If this tril succeeds, it will provide a new, more appropriate standard of care, available worldwide."
"9398219","Individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) carry mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene and develop benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors (neurofibromas) that cause significant morbidity, and mortality if they compress vital structures, and which can transform to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST). Neurofibromas contain normal nerve constituents: axons, Schwann cells, fibroblasts, macrophages and mast cells, and aberrant Schwann cells free of axons. Tumorigenesis results from complete loss of function at NF1, as neurofibroma Schwann cells are characterized by biallelic mutations in NF1, with other cell types recruited secondarily. We developed mouse model systems that are accurate mimics of neurofibroma formation in NF1, and performed large scale gene expression array analyses to identify candidate genes relevant to neurofibroma formation. Our robust Preliminary Data shows that a chemokine receptor, Cxcr3, is crucial for neurofibroma formation. In this application, we propose to use unique mouse models, neurofibroma Schwann cell precursors and Schwann cells to define the chemokine pathways through which Nf1 loss in Schwann cells leads to the presence of Cxcr3+ cells in neurofibroma (Aim 1) and to define CXCr3-expressing cells in neurofibroma and test their function (Aim 2). Finally, we will define molecules that are overexpressed in neurofibroma Schwann cells and are necessary for their survival (Aim 3). Together these studies will identify cellular and molecular underpinnings of tumor formation in the nervous system, and identify therapeutic targets for the treatment of NF1."
"9301418","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT ? Molecular Measures Core (MMC) The Molecular Measures Core (MMC) provides a centralized resource, analytical tools and expertise to measure a broad array of molecular analytes in support of Duke OAIC projects in their work to understand and optimize reserve and resilience. The MMC has served as an integral Resource Core in support of the Duke OAIC since 2006. For this funding cycle, the MMC will focus on molecular analyses that provide mechanistic insights into resiliencies at the cellular, tissue or organ levels that are expected to increase our understanding of the means to optimize reserve and resilience at the whole person level. The MMC will provide molecular analytic, mentoring and consultative support for a host of Research Education Core (REC) Scholar Projects, Pilot/Exploratory Studies (PESs) and External Projects (EPs). These projects test hypotheses related to aging across the lifespan, caloric restriction and enhanced protein weight loss interventions and involve a range of patient and sample types, including older dialysis patients, patients undergoing chemotherapy for multiple myeloma, patients undergoing pre-operative exercise therapy, young and old muscle satellite cells from sedentary or exercised mice with and without pharmacological autophagy induction, and young and old chondrocyte response to stressors. The MMC is capable of providing services to measure a broad array of cellular, molecular, biochemical and metabolic factors. The most pertinent Core services in the next funding cycle will include molecular measures of inflammation, targeted and non-targeted metabolomics, molecular measures of biological age, and measures related to wound healing and stress responses. In addition, the MMC will conduct a Developmental Project (DP-1) to develop and validate a panel of molecular markers indicative of senescent cell burden based on the recent knowledge that cellular senescence plays a key role in physiological tissue repair and remodeling responses. The DP2 validated panel will be made available to the Duke OAIC researchers in the latter years of funding. In addition, the MMC will provide Pathways Analysis (using Ingenuity Systems) of molecular data to identify potential biological networks involved in reserve and resilience. The exciting focus on resilience in this cycle provides an opportunity to explore the latest theories on aging that are particularly amenable and suited to evaluation by molecular approaches. The application of molecular and pathways analyses to these projects are expected to provide objective insights into the mechanisms underlying reserve and resilience in support of the mission of the Duke OAIC."

"9358154","OVERALL ? Project Summary/Abstract The Specific Pathogen Free Baboon Research Resource (SPFBRR) is the only national research resource of SPF baboons available to NIH grantees; intramural research programs of federal agencies, including the FDA, NSF and NIH; and other sponsors of biomedical research (private foundations, pharmaceutical companies, and contract research organizations). Absolutely unique in the entire world, the baboons in the SPFBRR have an extensive bioexclusion list of 19 pathogens normally found in other wild and captive nonhuman primate colonies. The SPFBRR was originally developed as an R24, and later as a P40, grant in a collaboration between the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC) and Oklahoma State University (OSU). However, a recent decision to end all nonhuman primate research at OUHSC has necessitated efforts to relocate the SPFBRR. An exhaustive effort by the leadership of OUHSC has resulted in the identification of a new home for this valuable and unique national research resource. The Michale E. Keeling Center for Comparative Medicine and Research (Keeling Center) of The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Bastrop, Texas has the facilities, expertise, experience, and infrastructure to meet the current and future needs of the SPFBRR. With this grant application, we propose to relocate the SPFBRR to the Keeling Center, accelerate growth of the SPF colony through re-derivation of infant baboons from a conventional (non-SPF) breeding colony, and maintain and expand partnerships with research programs using these invaluable SPF baboon resources. During the period of support requested in this application, the SPFBRR will be expanded to create a self-sustaining SPF breeding colony of behaviorally healthy and genetically robust breeding animals. This will eliminate the need for infants from conventional (non-SPF) dams, and it will significantly decrease the risk of introducing adventitious infectious agents into the SPFBRR. The overall goals of this P40 application are to relocate the SPFBRR to the Keeling Center so that this indispensable national research resource can be preserved; provide education and training to scientists, veterinarians, colony managers, and animal caregivers who work with baboons; conduct applied research to improve the resource; and, support investigators who need facilities and expertise for research projects involving SPF baboons. We will also perform mRNA sequencing of the major histocompatability complex (MHC) class I alleles for all of the foundation breeding baboons in the SPFBRR; and, we will perform whole genome sequencing (WGS) on 26 animals in the resource for genomic and pedigree analysis. This information will further refine and add value to the resources provided by the SPFBRR. Facilities originally designed for chimpanzees will be repurposed to meet the needs of the SPFBRR and other research facilities at the Keeling Center will provide space to conduct research with SPF baboons."
"9313747","ABSTRACT:  Spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) remains a significant obstetric dilemma with enormous costs to U.S. healthcare. The etiology of sPTB varies, but the final common pathway involves premature cervical remodeling (PCR), shortening and dilation. Despite the importance of this health issue, the pathophysiology of normal and PCR in humans is not well understood. For instance, the role of cervical smooth muscle cells (CSMCs) in cervical remodeling remains unknown. Over the last five years, under the guidance of my outstanding mentors, I have engaged in studies of cervical remodeling and helped to establish the Collaborative Cervix Research Group (CCRG) at Columbia University. The goal of the CCRG is to tackle the complex problem of PCR from a truly multidisciplinary approach. My initial work established that CSMCs at the internal os are circumferentially oriented (similar to a ?sphincter?) and cervical tissue from the internal os contracts in response to oxytocin. I propose that CSMCs may have two key functions: contraction and/or ECM remodeling. As pregnancy grows, the pressure from the growing fetus applies stretch to cervix. I hypothesize that CSMC stretch induces contraction (to maintain sphincter tone) and/or ECM remodeling. Further, I hypothesize that women with PCR exhibit abnormal cervical stretch responses, contractile force and/or ECM remodeling. In Aim 1, I will stretch pregnant cervical tissue biopsies and CSMCs from women with (study group) and without PCR (controls, CTL) to establish 1) if stretch induces cervical contractility, 2) if cervices and CSMCs from women with PCR exhibit aberrant contractility and 3) potential contractile mechanisms which may explain the contractility defect. In Aim 2, I will investigate if cervical tissue and CSMCs from women with PCR 1) exhibit abnormal stretch responses resulting in increased MMP activation, collagen turnover/ECM remodeling compared to CTLs and 2) if inflammation further enhances this stretch-induced MMP activation/ECM remodeling. In Aim 3, I will evaluate if stretch-induced molecular phenotypic changes exist at the transcriptome level in CSMC from women with PCR vs CTL with particular attention to contractility and ECM remodeling pathways. Toward this goal, I have been collecting tissue from pregnant women with a history of PCR and from gestational age-matched CTLs using IRB approved protocols. If women with PCR have 1) CSMCs that cannot contract and maintain ?sphincter-like? tone in response to stretch and/or 2) exhibit abnormal ECM remodeling responses to stretch resulting in a mechanically weaker cervix, this may explain why the cervix ultimately fails leading to sPTB. With the guidance of my mentors and CCRG team, this award will allow me to expand my experimental knowledge base and investigational skills so I may achieve my ultimate goal of becoming a successful and independent clinician scientist whose focus is to prevent PCR and PTB."
"9063988","X.A.I.

The IHFSC will promote the mission of the UTMB-CET by enhancing the capabilities of our members to integrate these approaches into their studies of important problems in environmental health. The scope of this integrative process will,  1) augment established Center member research programs with clinical and/or translational components strengthening, the multidisciplinary activities of the Collaborative Research Teams (CRTs) described in the Strategic Vision section (Section I);  2) enhance the scope and relevance of the Pilot Project Program; and 3) foster the development of community-based research  projects. The infrastructure of the IHSFC that supports this process consists of five interdigitating internal modules (Facilities, described below), leveraged by expertise and capital equipment in the other Facility Cores in the UTMB-CET and UTMB's CTSA.    The IHSFC is a new Core. Hence, the key to maximizing the impact of the IHSFC will be in its integration with both our outstanding cadre of established environmental Center scientists - including those involved in the innovative CRTs - and new faculty who will be enticed to bring their scientific skills to the environmental sciences at UTMB. Our close relationship to the Community Outreach and Engagement Core (COEC, described in Section XI) will facilitate public health research, including epidemiologic and community initiated studies.    The types of resources that Center members and Pilot Project Program recipients can derive from the IHSFC include: 1) Translational project study design and early steps of implementing these studies (Translational Research Facility, TRF), 2) Design of community-based research and assistance in identifying community partners with access to exposed and control populations who have a demonstrated interest in participating in research (Community-Based Research Facility, CBRF), 3) Access to a centralized facility for assessing environmental exposures to small-molecule pollutants and identifying biomarkers for these exposures and their biological consequences (Environmental Assessment and Biomarker Development Facility, EABDF), and  4) Research database development and biostatstical analyses (Biostatistics Facility, BSF) and Bioinformatics analyses of results (Bioinformatics Facility, BIF). The IHSFC will offer these services pro-bono or on a reduced-cost basis to UTMB-CET members and Pilot Project recipients.    Examples of broadly applicable technologies include the efficient, cost-effective web-based data management systems (BIF), and analytical procedures for quantifying trace amounts of low molecular weight toxicants in biological tissues and fluids (EABDF). In addition, the IHFSC will work closely with the COEC to disseminate the results of environmental health-related research to the surrounding community.    The Specific Aims of the IHSFC are to:  Aim 1. Provide the infrastructure to assist UTMB-CET members and Pilot Project Program recipients in designing and conducting experiments and research projects that extend their environmental science programs into studies of human health and disease, by providing:  ? Advice concerning the feasibility, ethics, IRB requirements and identification of clinical collaborators for translational clinical research projects  ? Access to a study coordinator who is experienced in both the administrative and clinical aspects of sample procurement  ? Access to a centralized biorepository for sample preparation, logging and storage in collaboration with the CTSA  ? Support for biostatistical aspects of study design and analysis, including power analysis, customized data management systems to facilitate the acquisition, organization and analysis, advanced modeling of the data derived from individual clinical subjects, epidemiological surveys and community initiated projects  ? Bioinformatic support for collection, analysis and interpretation of large data sets  ? Analytical support for identifying and quantifying small molecule contaminants in human and experimental animal tissues and fluids to assure the relevance of exposure of biological systems to environmental agents and to identify biomarkers of these exposures and their pathologic consequences    Aim 2. Provide faculty development and practical training in the areas of expertise represented in the five Facilities of the IHSFC to Center members and Pilot Project recipients. The process for achieving this aim is described in detail in this section and in the other sections referenced within."
"9398730","Summary/Abstract A recent review of trajectory research found that there is a great deal of research aimed at better understanding transitions in alcohol and other drug (AOD) use patterns from early to late adolescence and late adolescence to emerging adulthood. However, no studies to date have: a) 13 assessments of AOD use from age 10-24 across all developmental periods (middle school, high school, and emerging adulthood); b) a large sample with substantial racial and ethnic diversity, particularly among Hispanic and Asian youth; c) in-depth coverage of 10 areas of functioning across three key domains; d) subjective and objective neighborhood data; and e) the capacity to examine developmental trajectories for more than one substance. The current proposal continues R01AA016577 and R01AA020883 (PI: D?Amico), which together have assessed AOD use across nine waves of data from age 10 to age 19. The proposed study capitalizes on the longitudinal data on protective and risk factors we have collected since age 10 in a diverse cohort (44% Hispanic, 21% Asian, 21% white; 2% Black, 12% multiethnic/other; 54% female) by continuing to annually assess these youth in order to capture important transitions to emerging adulthood. Our specific aims are to: Aim 1a: Identify trajectories of alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and other drug use from age 10 into emerging adulthood. Assess differences by race/ethnicity. Aim 1b: Examine individual (e.g., resistance self-efficacy), peer (e.g., peer use) and family (e.g., parent disapproval of use) factors that may impact these trajectories. Test for similarities/differences in these associations across racial/ethnic groups. Aim 2a: Merge the survey data with the largest existing database of neighborhood measures to examine effects of neighborhood characteristics (economic, social, demographic, alcohol and marijuana outlet density) on AOD trajectories. Aim 2b: Test for similarities/differences in these associations across racial/ethnic groups. Aim 3a: Examine how AOD use trajectories during middle and high school predict outcomes through age 24 in three core domains: 1) risk behaviors (e.g., AOD use, risky sexual behavior, delinquency), 2) health related quality of life (e.g., mental, physical, social), and 3) adult role functioning and transitions (e.g., education, relationships, life satisfaction). Aim 3b: Test for similarities/differences in these associations across racial/ethnic groups. Aim 4a: Using new data gathered annually from ages 20-24, examine how adult role functioning and transitions longitudinally predict subsequent changes in AOD use and other risk behaviors, as well as health-related quality of life, in emerging adulthood. Aim 4b: Test for similarities/differences in these associations across racial/ethnic groups. By advancing the epidemiology of alcohol use during adolescence and emerging adulthood, our findings can impact prevention and intervention programming for young people and address public health policy. 1"
"9209612","Abstract: In recent years, AIDS-related mortality has dramatically decreased due to the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) but the mortality caused by the non-AIDS-defining cancers, especially lung cancer (LC) is continuously rising. In the U.S., LC becomes the most common and most deadly non-AIDS- defining cancer in HIV(+) populations. Although smoking is a key risk factor for HIV associated LCs, HIV(+) individuals still have a significantly increased LC risk after controlling for smoking status, indicating that other factors are responsible for the higher LC incidence in HIV(+) populations. Existing etiology studies have been largely focused on the involvement of human papillomavirus (HPV) in non-HIV associated LCs. A study to investigate the role of HPV in HIV associated LCs has not yet been reported. To date, the view on whether or not HPV is associated with LCs is highly controversial, since the observed HPV infection rate in LCs varies from 0 to 100%. Further, the hypothetic role of HPV in LCs is mainly based on the detection of HPV genomic DNA in LCs. So far, none of the association studies has demonstrated that the detected HPV DNA is transcriptionally active in the lung tumor tissues. Without evidence of viral transcription, the causal role of HPV in LCs is highly questionable, since it's well known that HPV must be transcriptionally active in order to induce its associated cancers. The overarching goal of this proposal is to resolve this long-standing controversy of the involvement of HPV in LCs using our cutting-edge sequencing and informatics approaches and information obtained from the natural in vivo tumor environment. To accomplish this goal, we will first examine our hypothesis that HPV is causally associated with a subset of LCs in HIV(+) population, but not in the general population. The rest of the work will test our hypothesis that HPV promotes lung oncogenesis by inducing a unique set of cancer driver mutations and manipulating cancer pathways through synergistic expression of viral E5 and E7 genes. By conducting the proposed work, we expect to get solid evidence supporting a causal role of HPV in HIV associated LCs and obtain much needed, unprecedented insight into the unique mechanism underlying the HPV(+) LCs in HIV infected individuals, which may be particularly significant for future patient care and disease management."
"9408949","ABSTRACT/PROJECT SUMMARY  The product that will result from this proposed Phase I/II (Fast-Track) SBIR project will be a gene therapy for cystic fibrosis (CF) that will, following a single inhalational administration, be curative to all people with CF regardless of the specific causative mutation they have. CF is a life-threatening disease caused by any one of the hundreds of documented autosomal recessive mutations in the CFTR gene. Derangement of CFTR interferes with mucociliary transport and antibacterial activity in the airways and gut and a buildup of mucous and susceptibility to airway infections that is ultimately lethal. Current treatments include symptomatic airway support (e.g., mucolytics) or CFTR modulators, none of which address disease progression and many of which have efficacy for only a subset of CF-causative mutations. To date there is no cure for CF and the average life expectancy of a person with CF is 39 years.  Gene therapy has the potential to be a game-changer in the field of CF, by offering a universal cure. However, for gene therapy to be considered to be a clinically relevant option for CF, substantial efficacy is still needed ? the main limiting factor is the ability of a vector to effectively and efficiently deliver a large payload like CFTR. Talee Bio's academic founders and collaborators at the University of Iowa and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia have more than 25 years of experience in this field. Recently, we developed a proprietary lentivirus gene therapy technology that could address this need for CF, with the ability to carry a large payload and genetically engineered with an envelope protein which increases binding and entry to the surface of airway epithelial cells. Our preliminary data indicate that a prototype of our product can deliver CFTR effectively to airway epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo, that expression persists for at least two years, and that it shows no evidence of genotoxicity. Here we will validate the efficacy of our clinic-ready product (phase 1), and will conduct the initial biodistribution and safety work that will enable a pre-IND meeting with the FDA.  Talee Bio is supported by academic collaborators with more than 100 years of collective experience in CF biology, pathology, and gene therapy, and by a management team with demonstrable experience in drug development. Talee has raised financing from a foundation (Emily's Entourage) and from an investor, Phase 1 Ventures, to accelerate the outcomes of this SBIR into the clinic."
"9319099","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prenatal alcohol exposure is the leading preventable cause of birth defects in the United States, producing an array of neurological, behavioral and physical abnormalities collectively known as Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Early diagnosis of FASD is the key to effective interventions and treatments, particularly for children under the age of 3 who may benefit from early neuroplasticity and reduce the long-term adverse effects.  The long-term goal of our research program is to provide the science to support routine newborn screening for prenatal alcohol exposure. The primary aim of this international U01 grant proposal is to examine the association between maternal alcohol use and newborn phosphatidylethanol (PEth) levels in their newborn children, in a country (Uruguay) where significant alcohol use is common during pregnancy. Our previous work in public health care hospitals in Montevideo, Uruguay documented high rates of alcohol use during pregnancy (60%) and PEth levels in newborns (79%). PEth is a new biomarker that detects episodic heavy drinking (3 or more drinks) in the last 30 days. The test is 100% specific in detecting recent alcohol use with no known false positives.  This proposed design is a cross-sectional study that will include1500 women 18 years and older and their newborns. Women who are admitted to one of two selected public health care hospitals in Montevideo, Uruguay for obstetrical care will be recruited to participate in the study. Maternal alcohol use will be assessed using a validated measure developed by Drs. Phil May and Wilsnack. The interview schedule has become the standard measure to assess maternal alcohol use and fetal alcohol exposure in the US and other countries. Maternal alcohol biomarker assays will include ethylglucuronide (EtG) in hair and nails and PEth in blood obtained at the time of delivery. Newborn umbilical cord and routine 48 hour heel stick blood will be collected to assess newborn PEth levels. By collecting newborn PEth levels at birth and 48 hours later we can assess the PEth kinetics to determine the optimum time to measure newborn PEth levels. By comparing newborn Peth levels with maternal self-reported alcohol use and alcohol biomarkers this innovative study will provide new information on the sensitivity and specificity of PEth as a newborn biomarker of prenatal alcohol exposure.  The findings from this study could have enormous public health and policy implications, should PEth prove to be a highly sensitive and specific indicator of risky prenatal alcohol exposure. Analysis of PEth in dried blood spot cards would be the first assay to identify prenatal alcohol exposure in a universally available sample of newborn blood. Future work may also help us correlate newborn PEth levels with long-term behavioral, learning and developmental deficits in children and assist in early diagnosis of children with FASD."
"9337418","Abstract Pancreatic cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosed in the United States, with more than 43,000 new cases in 2013. It is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in both men and women. Nonetheless, there has been no significant improvement in survival for pancreatic ductal adenocarci- noma (PDAC) patients over the past 30+ years. For this reason, there is a considerable and urgent clinical need to develop innovative strategies for effective drug delivery and treatment monitoring, re- sulting in improved outcomes for patients with PDAC. Our proposal aims at developing contrast-enhanced ultrasound-mediated image-guided drug delivery (CEUS-IGDD) to be that methodology and to translate it from the lab to the clinic. The specific tasks are designed to improve the understanding and methodology for control and monitoring of this IGDD platform, with an initial clinical focus on enhancing the effectiveness of standard chemotherapeutics for treatment of inoperable PDAC.  Inherently this project constitutes a multidisciplinary challenge (technological, biological, physical, and medical), and our strategy to address the critical barriers therefore unites an interdisciplinary team of academic and industrial investigators from GE Global Research (GE), Haukeland University Hospital and University of Bergen (together: Bergen), Thomas Jefferson University (TJU), and Rush University Medical Center with more limited efforts by the Israel Institute of Technology and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).  Aim 1 will develop tools and methods to ascertain optimal conditions (acoustic regime, bubble type) for maximum drug delivery with minimal application of diagnostic-range acoustic energy. Aim 2 utilizes two com- plementary established pancreatic adenocarcinoma mouse models, using human MIA PaCa-2luc (Bergen) and PANC-1 (TJU) cell lines. The efficacy of CEUS-IGDD will be evaluated using biodistribution data and quan- titative imaging methods to monitor treatment response expecting a greater median survival of at least 5 days and a median tumor volume reduction of 50% in the treated group compared to animals receiving drug alone. The main focus of this proposal is Aim 3, where a three year, multi-center clinical trial en- rolling one hundred and twenty (120) patients with metastatic or locally advanced and surgically unresectable PDAC will be conducted at TJU and Bergen. All patients will undergo standard of care chemotherapy, with one-half receiving adjunctive CEUS-IGDD. Patient outcomes will be compared by quantitative ultrasound as- sessment, CT imaging including RECIST criteria, ECOG grade, and immunohistochemistry to assess local progression-free and overall survival with the main endpoint being to increase the number of chemo- therapy cycles by 75% in the IGDD group relative to controls."
"9538440","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epidemiological evidence demonstrates that obesity is rising exponentially to pandemic levels in the USA. The failure of current pharmacological approaches to treat obesity strongly indicates that new therapeutic strategies are required. New strategies require new knowledge. We recently identified a peptide named TLQP-21 which is encoded by the VGF gene. TLQP-21 binds the G-protein coupled receptor Complement 3a receptor1 (C3aR1), potentiates ?-adrenergic receptors (?AR)-induced lipolysis and, reduces fat mass in obese mice. TLQP-21 also improves diabetes and has a very safe cardiovascular profile. Much remains to be established on it molecular mechanism of action. Similarly, the role of C3aR1 is well established in immunity but its functional role in adipocytes and obesity is poorly understood. We propose a project in which the Central Hypothesis will be tested that TLQP-21 opposes obesity by enhancing lipolysis with a mechanism requiring priming by cAMP and mediated by increased intracellular calcium concentration. The Specific Aim (SA)1 will determine the role of cAMP on priming TLQP-21-induced activation of C3aR1 in adipocytes and the role of increased [Ca2+]i on its pro-lipolytic effect. The SA2 will investigate the physiologicl consequence of introducing an inactive TLQP-21 mutant on the development of obesity in mice and the behavior of the peptide in a C3aR1 ko mouse. Finally, SA3 will focus on the pro-lipolytic effect of TLQP-21 in human adipocytes. The impact of successful achievement of the aims of this project will be significant on the field. After the failure of sympathomimetic drugs and other pro-lipolytic agents to cure obesity, current therapeutic approaches primarily target feeding or nutrient absorption through the gastro-enteric tract. These more recent approaches are not devoid of adverse effects. The mechanism of action of TLQP-21 has the potential to cure obesity by selectively and safely reducing the excessive adipose fat mass."
"9350158","Project Summary  Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a human ciliopathy characterized by the dysfunction of primary cilia and retinal degeneration via photoreceptor cell degradation in the affected retina. The BBS genes associated with the ciliopathy are all associated with the primary cilia, and 8 BBS proteins form a BBSome protein complex. Limited analysis of primary cilia dynamics in BBS mutant mice suggests that the BBSome is essential for transport of primary cilia cargo proteins, but beyond these preliminary findings, little is known of BBSome function in the primary cilia, including the primary cilia of rod photoreceptors in the retina. Notably, retinal gene replacement via AAV subretinal injection has yielded promising results in preliminary studies in BBS mutant moue models. In this proposal, I outline a series of experiments that utilize STORM and PALM super resolution imaging along with cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) ultra-structural analysis to address (1) the precise localization of the BBSome in rod photoreceptor cilia and (2) the subcellular outcome of retinal gene replacement therapy into rod photoreceptor cells. (1) STORM super resolution localization (to a resolution of ~20nm) will be used to localize the BBSome complex in rod photoreceptor cells of wild-type, as well as BBS4- /- and BBS1M390R mutant mice, via a series STORM immunostaining experiments with specific antibodies. (2) BBS1 and BBS4 fused to PALM protein tags will be cloned into an optimized AAV vector for validation and subsequent subretinal injection into the BBS4-/- and BBS1M390R mutant mouse retinas. Localization of treated rod photoreceptors cells will be assessed with a combination of STORM and PALM imaging, in addition to ultra-structural morphological analysis via cryo-Et. With the application of these new and powerful imaging techniques, I will assess, for the first time, the subcellular effects of retinal gene therapy, and accurately track the localization of the BBSome relative to markers of the rod cilium and the morphological defects associated with these BBS mutant models. Together, the results from these research aims will aid in determining the function of the wild-type BBSome, which is critical for rod cell viability, and will also demonstrate the feasibility for BBS gene replacement therapy into mutant photoreceptor cells as a possible treatment for BBS and other retinal degenerative defects."
"9383166","PROJECT SUMMARY In multiple sclerosis (MS), the most common neurological disease in the working young, inflammatory cells infiltrate the central nervous system (CNS) and attack the myelin-producing cells that are crucial for function and survival of axons. Most patients experience a relapsing-remitting disease course with ever worsening neurological symptoms and, ultimately, disability. Current diagnostic imaging techniques cannot predict relapses because they cannot detect the active leukocyte infiltration into the CNS that leads to clinical disease symptoms downstream. This proposal intends to provide a method that enables non-invasive assessment of this asymptomatic disease activity based on the detection of leukocyte-endothelial interaction (LEI) in the retina by live imaging, which will allow prediction of MS relapses and rapid feedback on treatment response and disease progression. Thus, retinal LEI detection could help transform therapeutic intervention in MS and mitigate the development and severity of disability in MS. LEI, the rolling of white blood cells that is a requirement for leukocyte infiltration, is absent in healthy CNS and considered a hallmark of inflammation. We hypothesize that retinal LEI near the optic nerve head (ONH) indicates active leukocyte infiltration into the CNS that precedes MRI detectable lesions and clinical disease symptoms. The retina is an optically accessible compartment of the CNS that lends itself to optical, intravital imaging through the pupil of the eye. With a scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO), custom built for mouse retinal imaging, retinal LEI was detected in early stages of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an accepted rodent model of MS, prior to clinical symptoms. Our preliminary data further demonstrated, that pro-inflammatory messengers can reach the retina via transport of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and cause retinal LEI, although the retina and optic nerve themselves are not inflamed. In aim 1, we will characterize retinal LEI in EAE and compare its time course to that of leukocyte infiltration into the CNS, as assessed by flow cytometric analysis, and to development of CNS lesions by MRI. Treatment will be administered upon LEI detection and the disease time course compared with untreated controls. In aim 2, we will assess the sensitivity of retinal LEI to remotely detect CNS inflammation. We determine if the location of an inflammatory brain lesion affects the frequency of retinal LEI. Furthermore, MS-relevant cytokines will be injected directly into the CSF to test their ability to elicit retinal LEI. In aim 3, we will develop an adaptive optics (AO) SLO that is specialized for the detection of retinal LEI. Using high-speed scanning and a woofer-tweeter AO architecture, the instrument will generate a field of view that probes the area in and near the optic nerve head, where most LEI would be expected. This cutting-edge instrument will be used in a pilot study to assess retinal LEI in MS patients."
"9410593","ABSTRACT Adherence is essential for the effectiveness of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in reducing HIV transmission. Male sex workers (MSW), men who sell sex to other men, can benefit from PrEP because they are at high risk of HIV acquisition and transmission. However, they have difficulties adhering to a daily pill because they commonly have low awareness of their risk and limited knowledge of new prevention tools, and face barriers to access prevention services. Our long-term goal is to advance implementation of PrEP to reduce HIV incidence in key populations in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The objective of this R34 application is to prepare for testing innovative user-centered ways to promote PrEP adherence at scale. Our central hypothesis is that adherence to PrEP can be improved among MSW if PrEP is provided for free along with highly-tailored conditional economic incentives (CEI). The specific aims are:  Aim 1: To refine the design of PrEP adherence intervention with user-centered conditional economic incentives to maximize sustained adherence behaviors through a user-responsive computerized survey (n=200). We incorporate quantitatively identified preferences for CEIs through a user- responsive computerized survey. We use conjoint analysis to understand preferences for CEI intervention components and how CEIs should be integrated into an optimal combination package to be tested in Aim 2.  Aim 2: Measure the extent to which a user-centered CEI intervention can help MSW increase their adherence to free PrEP in a randomized controlled pilot (n=100). Among MSW who accept to take free PrEP, and return at month 1 for a second pill bottle, we will randomize n=100 MSW to either: standard of care (SoC: information, prescription, free PrEP) or CEI (SoC + incentives contingent on sufficiently-high adherence to PrEP). We will assess the primary outcome (biomarker of adherence using scalp hair analysis) at months 3 and 6, as well as secondary outcomes: clinic attendance/retention, medication possession ratio, self-reported PrEP use, and sexual behavioral disinhibition (number of partners, condom use, incident STI).  Aim 3: Estimate the preliminary cost-effectiveness of incentives for PrEP adherence to maximize future policy and practice relevance of this promising intervention strategy. Our working hypothesis is that conditional economic incentives for PrEP adherence will be cost-effective in terms of cost per fully- adherent month on PrEP, cost per HIV infection averted, and cost per disability-adjusted life year saved when compared to controls not receiving the conditional incentives. The expected outcome of this R34 is a demonstration that is feasible to implement user-centered CEIs in this context, as well as preliminary efficacy and cost-effectiveness data. The project will have positive impact because it is a critical step toward scaled-up implementation of PrEP in this highly-at-risk population of MSWs in Mexico, with implications for other concentrated epidemics among MSW worldwide."
"9269197","?     DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant): A renewal of the NIBIB Center for Advanced Magnetic Resonance Technology at Stanford University School of Medicine is proposed. Magnetic resonance instrument manufacturers introduce new technology in their products based on marketing and other factors that often preclude the timely availability of cutting edge research capabilities for investigators. To fill this gap, the Center continues to develop and make available innovative technologies in five related research areas of magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy     (MRI/MRS): (1) Image Reconstruction, Fast Imaging, and RF Pulse Design, (2) MR hardware and High Field, (3) Body Imaging Methods, (4) Functional/ & Structural Neuroimaging Methods, and (5) MR Spectroscopy & Multinuclear Imaging. In each of these project areas, we will capitalize on the extensive experience in Stanford's Radiology and Electrical Engineering departments to improve and expand imaging technology for use in basic research and clinical care, and to provide cutting edge opportunities for biomedical research with MRI.          Over the past five years, the Center has been motivated by and has served a wide base of extramurally sponsored collaborators and service users from leading medical and research institutions. We will continue to nurture these collaborations and mutually enrich our research and development efforts. Examples of collaborative projects today are the development and use of advanced functional MRI imaging methods in neurosciences and the incorporation of sparsely sampled MRI acquisition and reconstruction methods.          We will continue to train students and postdoctoral fellows to be the future leaders in MR, to publish extensively, and to provide educational opportunities to the scientific and medical communities we serve. New technology and technological capabilities developed at the Center and as part of our extensive collateral research will be disseminated rapidly for widespread use in the national research community. Publications, conference presentations, annual reports and the internet (http://camrt.stanford.edu/) will continue to form the backbone of our dissemination efforts."
"9409690","ABSTRACT Borrelia miyamotoi is a tick-transmitted spirochete recently shown to cause infection and disease in the United States, Europe and Asia. A member of the relapsing fever group of Borrelia, this pathogen has been proven to cause most commonly a nonspecific, flu-like illness with fever, fatigue, myalgia, and headache. Disease can be particularly severe and involve the central nervous system in immunocompromised patients. The true extent of disease due to this bacterium is difficult to assess because of the lack of a fully validated diagnostic assay. Conversely, development of a clinically useful test is difficult because of the lack of a large cohort of clinically well-characterized patients infected with B. miyamotoi. We have access to two populations of well-characterized patients from which we can identify cases of active disease. Our goal over Phases I and II of this project is to assemble a collection of up to 100 serum samples from patients known to have been exposed to and/or infected with B. miyamotoi. The first cohort of patients consists of individuals who have been bitten by ticks and who have submitted these ticks for analysis to our collaborator Dr. Rich. If the tick is found to be infected with Borrelia miyamotoi, we will contact the patient and obtain blood and serum samples. The second group of patients will consist of individuals who consulted their healthcare professional with symptoms of febrile illness in the spring and summer and who are suspected of having a tickborne illness. We have developed a prototype multiplexed serological assay for Borrelia miyamotoi infection based on seven published or proprietary antigens. We propose to validate this assay by analyzing serum samples from both cohorts of infected patients. Statistical methods will be used to identify the most useful diagnostic antigens and to develop an algorithm optimizing the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Patients infected with Borrelia miyamotoi will be identified by a PCR reaction that is positive for this pathogen, or by evidence of seroconversion between acute and convalescent samples. A statistical approach will allow us to identify those antigens that are diagnostically informative and to develop validated criteria to correctly diagnose B. miyamotoi infection using our multiplex assay."
"9390420","PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT This K76 Paul B. Beeson Emerging Leaders Career Development Award in Aging proposes to provide Dr. Caroline Stephens, a newly promoted Associate Professor in the UCSF School of Nursing, with mentorship and training in translational qualitative research, implementation science, clinical trials, and leadership development. The proposed training and support will provide her with the necessary additional skills to become a transformative interdisciplinary leader in aging and palliative care research who examines and promotes changes at the junctures of healthcare systems to improve access to palliative care services and supports for hard to reach nursing home (NH) populations. She has assembled an excellent multidisciplinary team of mentors and scientific advisors with the following areas of expertise: clinical geriatrics and palliative care (Drs. Christine Ritchie and Sei Lee); implementation science (Drs. C. Ritchie and S. Lee); integrated care delivery models for frail elders (Dr. C. Ritchie and L. Branagan); measuring and improving health care quality in NHs (Drs. S. Lee, Charlene Harrington, Joseph Ouslander); developing/evaluating patient-centered technologies, such as telehealth, for improving care for medically complex older adults (Drs. C. Ritchie and L. Branagan); statistical expertise on clinical trial design and analysis of complex datasets (Dr. J. Neuhaus); long term care health policy (Dr. C. Harrington); translational qualitative research methods (Dr. J. Shim); developing, testing and evaluating multi- component interventions in the NH setting (Dr. J. Ouslander). Suboptimal communication and lack of access to appropriate and timely palliative care expertise and support in the NH setting often leads to burdensome transitions, particularly at the end of life. Dr. Stephens' research will focus on developing, optimizing and pilot-testing a multi-component Improving Access Through Technology (ImPAcTT) intervention that leverages existing telehealth technologies to provide staff education; family outreach, engagement and support; care coordination; and resident symptom management and facilitation of goals-of-care discussion. ImPAcTT employs a secure communications platform that permits multi- person live video, audio, and text message consultations; real-time document sharing and documentation for advanced care planning discussions; and remote virtual assessment capabilities. In Aim 1, she will conduct semi-structured interviews with NH staff, residents and families to explore potential barriers and facilitators to using telehealth for increasing upstream access to PC expertise, support, and education. In Aim 2, she will assess the technical feasibility of telehealth to provide NH palliative care education and support, and develop and refine study protocols with up to 10 NH residents, families and staff. In Aim 3, she will conduct a pilot implementation trial in 3 NHs to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the multi-component ImPAcTT intervention. These studies will provide the scientific foundation for a compelling R01 application to evaluate the outcomes of this ImPAcTT intervention in a multi-site RCT."
"9321935","Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (HPS) is an autosomal recessive disorder that is associated with oculocutaneous albinism, bleeding diatheses, granulomatous colitis, and highly penetrant pulmonary fibrosis in some subtypes, particularly HPS-1. In at-risk HPS genotypes, pulmonary fibrosis has been reported to develop in all patients typically in the third to fourth decades of life, with patients succumbing within 3 to 10 years of diagnosis in the absence of lung transplantation. Despite knowledge of the underlying genetic defects, there are currently no therapeutic or preventative approaches for HPS pulmonary fibrosis, or for most fibrotic lung diseases. HPS pulmonary fibrosis exhibits some clinical and radiographic features found in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), but occurs at a younger age. Lung histology from affected HPS patients also shares some similarities to the patterns observed in IPF, including hyperplastic type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECs). However, other features of HPS pulmonary fibrosis are not typical for IPF, including the presence of irregular lamellar bodies and lipid accumulation in AECs, and the presence of alveolar inflammation and alveolar macrophage activation. With a multitude of ongoing and planned treatment trials for IPF, it is essential to better understand the pathogenesis of HPS pulmonary fibrosis so that drugs proven to be effective in IPF can be considered for future studies in HPS patients. Our preliminary data demonstrate increased oxidative stress in the lungs of HPS mouse models and in lung tissue from HPS patients. Our hypothesis is that HPS trafficking mutations result in oxidative stress, which renders already vulnerable AECs susceptible to environmental 'second hits' over time that result in pulmonary fibrosis. To test this hypothesis and prepare for clinical trials in HPS, we propose the following specific aims: 1) To identify the earliest measurable pulmonary disease activity in individuals at-risk for HPS pulmonary fibrosis, 2) To determine whether HPS patients exhibit increased markers of oxidative stress, and whether oxidative stress measures correlate with pulmonary disease activity and/or pulmonary disease risk in patients with HPS, and 3) To determine whether molecular signatures of HPS pulmonary fibrosis are similar to that observed in other causes of pulmonary fibrosis. Overall, these studies will provide insights into the pathogenesis of HPS pulmonary fibrosis and prepare for clinical trials. Identification of biologic outcome measures will aid in future clinical trials in this rare disease."
"9412025","Project Summary The Oregon HIV/Hepatitis and Opioid Prevention and Engagement (OR-HOPE) study is a two- phase (UG3 & UH3), multi-method study to implement community action teams and a peer rural care coordinator intervention in rural Oregon counties at high risk for opioid overdose, hepatitis C, and HIV. The study leverages existing and developing public health and treatment infrastructure to implement a sustainable rural peer care coordinator (PCC) model. In Phase 1 (UG3), we develop community action teams that review and develop local community response plans to address OUD and its consequences in 2 high-needs rural counties. Focus groups and qualitative interviews with community stakeholders (primary care providers, public health officials, law enforcement, and affected community members) document needs, resources, and identify best practices for response plan implementation. We also assess the feasibility of a PCC intervention to improve HIV, hepatitis C testing and linkage to care for people with OUD, and sending confirmatory phlebotomy to CDC/GHOST lab. A concomitant telehealth intervention supports primary care providers in treatment of patients with OUD and hepatitis C. Phase 1 (UG3) milestones include: 1) development of community response plans, 2) enrollment of primary care providers in telehealth support, 3) pilot implementation of PCC intervention, and 4) participant phlebotomy samples successfully sent to CDC/GHOST lab. In Phase 2, we scale- up the PCC intervention to 8 rural counties to assess the effectiveness of PCCs in improving HIV and hepatitis C testing, opioid overdose, and linkage to treatment for HIV, hepatitis C, and opioid use disorder. The step-wedge implementation design includes counties not yet initiating the intervention to serve as temporal controls. The primary outcome is 1) number of HIV tests performed in intervention versus non-intervention counties. Secondary outcomes include a) overdose rates, b) initiation of HIV treatment, c) initiation of HCV treatment, d) initiation of OUD treatment, e) HIV viral suppression at one year, and f) hepatitis C sustained viral response. Continued qualitative stakeholder interviews in Phase 2 document challenges and best practices for PCC intervention and community response plan implementation. The results inform development of novel and sustainable community intervention models to decrease OUD and its consequences in rural America. The proposed work aligns with NIH Office of AIDS Research priorities of expanding HIV testing and engagement in treatment, and treatment of HIV comorbidities."
"9331610","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research: Protein phosphorylation by protein kinases is an important regulatory mechanism that influences every aspect of cellular life. The majority of phosphoproteins are intracellular; however, numerous extracellular proteins are also phosphorylated. In fact, the first evidence of protein phosphorylation was in 1883, when the secreted milk protein casein was shown to contain phosphate. In hindsight, this was the first indication for the existence of protein kinases. Many secreted proteins are phosphorylated by protein kinases present within the lumen of the Golgi. However, these enzymes are poorly characterized and their activities have been ascribed to the category of orphan enzymes (enzymes that have not been molecularly identified). One such kinase has been biochemically characterized from highly enriched Golgi fractions and named Golgi casein kinase (G-CK). The proteins known as casein kinases are in fact cytosolic and nuclear proteins and do not mediate physiological phosphorylation of casein because they are spatially restricted from the secretory apparatus and the extracellular space. The G-CK specifically recognizes the consensus Ser-x-(Glu/pSer) (where x is any amino acid and Glu/pSer can be Glu or phospho-Ser) and this motif is phosphorylated in some 75% of human plasma and cerebrospinal fluid phosphoproteins. The candidate was the first to identify the G-CK as Fam20C, and showed that it belongs to a novel family of atypical protein kinases that localize within the Golgi apparatus and are secreted. Fam20C phosphorylates casein and several hormones specifically at S-x-E/pS motifs in the lumen of the Golgi. Indeed, many hormones contain phosphate within this motif; however, in most cases, established functions for phosphorylation are unknown. Prior to the candidates' discovery that Fam20C was a protein kinase, it had been suggested to be a novel regulator of Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF23). Fam20C null mice develop hypophosphatemic rickets (HR) as a result of elevated secretion of FGF23, a bone- derived hormone implicated in the pathogenesis of many human diseases including disorders of mineral metabolism and chronic kidney disease. Hypothesis: The aims of this proposal were designed to test the hypothesis that the secreted protein kinase Fam20C regulates FGF23 by phosphorylation. The hypothesis was formulated based on three recent observations: 1) Fam20C is a protein kinase that phosphorylates secreted proteins at S-x-E/pS (Tagliabracci et. al., Science 2012). 2) Fam20C null mice develop hypophosphatemic rickets due to an increase in FGF23 (Wang et. al., PLoS Genet. 2012) and 3) Fam20C phosphorylates FGF23 at Ser180 within an important regulatory motif and at 3 highly conserved amino acids within the C terminus that may affect binding of the hormone to its cognate receptor (preliminary data, unpublished). Research Objective: The overall objective of this proposal is to determine the molecular mechanisms by which Fam20C regulates FGF23 processing and activity. Approach: The candidate will utilize a combination of molecular biology, biochemistry, cell biology, and mouse genetics to accomplish the research objective. The mentored phase (K99, Specific Aims 1 and 2) will consist of in vitro and cell based approaches to determine the molecular mechanism by which Fam20C regulates FGF23. The candidate will take advantage of the resources and personnel at UCSD, both of which are outstanding and well-suited for this phase of the award. The independent phase (Specific Aim 3) will employ mouse models to study the regulation of FGF23 by Fam20C. Significance: The experiments proposed in this application will answer fundamental questions regarding the pathogenesis of several disorders of mineral metabolism, including hereditary disorders of hypophosphatemic rickets; affecting ~1 in every 20,000 newborns. Furthermore, the results will have important implications for patients with chronic kidney disease, a growing public health epidemic that affects 26 million Americans. Training: The proposed research will be conducted within the department of Pharmacology at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), under the mentorship of Dr. Jack E. Dixon. Dr. Dixon is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, USA, a Royal Society Fellow, and has led a distinguished scientific career. In addition, collaborations were established with Kenneth White, PhD, a leader in the field of metabolic bone diseases and Joachim H. Ix, MD, a noted nephrologist and epidemiologist. The candidate will undertake coursework through UCSD, participate in regular seminars, and present his findings at national scientific meetings. Overall, the training environment is excellent and the proposed studies are well designed and innovative. The hypothesis addresses a significant question that should yield influential findings in endocrinology, nephrology cardiology and basic biomedical research. The mentoring and research skills expected to develop over the course of the award will provide a strong foundation for the candidate to successfully transition to become a prominent independent investigator and leader in the field of secreted protein phosphorylation."
"9369592","The long-term objectives of the GLO VIP project are to define the virome of the female reproductive tract longitudinally before, during and after pregnancy, and to assess its relationship to preterm birth (PTB) and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. The study will employ three extant cohorts generated from our previous studies: 1) a cohort of ~1000 pregnant women who participated in our Vaginal Human Microbiome Project (VaHMP) which collected over 60,000 cross-sectional samples (cervical, vaginal, buccal, perianal, blood) from ~6500 visitors to our women?s clinics at the VCU Health Center; 2) a cohort of ~1000 pregnant women who participated in our Multi Omic Microbiome Study Pregnancy Initiative (MOMS PI) and were sampled longitudinally in VCU?s women?s clinics, Labor & Delivery, NICU, and Newborn Baby Clinic; and 3) a cohort of ~500 pregnant women who participated in MOMS PI but were sampled longitudinally at women?s clinics at Swedish Hospital, Yakima General Hospital, and the University of Washington Health Center. Approximately 150,000 longitudinal samples (cervical, vaginal, buccal, rectal, blood, urine, placenta, cord, cord blood, meconium and first stool) have been prepared for RNA, DNA, proteome, metabolome, and immunoproteome analyses. Slightly over 30% of the women in each of these cohorts experienced complicated pregnancies; e.g., 10-15% PTB, ~10% premature rupture of membranes (PROM) or preterm PROM (PPROM), ~20% hypertension, ~10% gestational diabetes, and ~5% pre-eclampsia. We have identified ~250 subjects (~150 with adverse outcomes) from the VaHMP cohort and ~240 (~200 with adverse outcomes) from the VCU cohort of MOMS PI for the discovery phase of this project, in which we will employ Whole Metagenome Sequencing (WMGS) and Whole Metatranscriptome Sequencing (WMTS) to characterize the DNA and RNA viromes, including both known and previously unknown viruses, of the female reproductive tract and probe for relationships between the virome and adverse pregnancy outcomes, and correlate the relationship between the bacterial microbiome, the virome, and health. Samples from participants (~100 with adverse outcomes) from the Seattle cohort of MOMS PI will be used in the validation phase of the study in which we will examine birth products and neonatal samples (meconium, buccal, first stool) for viral activity and replicate our results from the discovery phase of the project. In addition, we will characterize host responses in selected samples by metabolomics and immunoproteomic analysis of metabolyte and cytokine levels in blood and other relevant tissues from participants and neonates identified as of interest in the discovery phase of the project. Our results will provide both a comprehensive overview of the virome of the female reproductive tract and its impact on pregnancy, and indications of the role(s) of the virome in adverse pregnancy outcomes."
"9331713","Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a leading cause of death in the United States. Statin therapy has proven remarkably effective in reducing CVD events when used in those at risk, yet statins remain under- utilized. These gaps in care represent a twofold problem: a failure to appropriately identify candidates for primary prevention and a failure of patients to take these medications when offered. Currently available models to predict CVD risk have significant limitations, particularly for younger adults. Further, their probabilistic outputs are neither easily understood nor impactful to patients. Dr. Navar's K01 proposal uses pooled data from seven NHLBI cohort studies to create an improved CVD risk prediction model for young adults. This model will estimate ?continuous? lifetime CVD risk, incorporating a range of risk factors and evaluating risk at multiple patient ages. Second, Dr. Navar will evaluate how this novel continuous lifetime risk model improves identification of candidates for statin therapy relative to current risk tools. Third, to improve the ability to communicate these data to patients, she will transform these risk estimates into population relative risk. This will allow a patient to understand how his CVD risk profile compares with similar age- and gender-matched peers. She will then use a unique national registry to better understand how best to communicate numerical and probabilistic data to which patients. Finally, she will develop a web-based risk communication tool that incorporates the novel lifetime risk, population relative risk, and current 10-year risk estimates and pilot this tool in patient focus groups. This web-based tool will be linked to the electronic health record and tested in an outpatient clinical setting to assess how real time estimation and patient-tailored shared decision-making affect clinical care. The current proposal will also assist Dr. Navar in fully strengthening her background in public health. The didactic and applied statistical experiences, including training in predictive modeling and causal analysis, will allow her to become more prepared to be a national leader in the understanding of real world safety and effectiveness of preventive therapies. Similarly, the formal training in qualitative research and behavioral science proposed in this application, combined with the practical development of a CVD risk communication tool, will allow her to establish a program of independent research focused on improved uptake of CVD preventive therapies through effective patient risk communication. This training program builds on already successful research at the Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI). The mentorship team, led by Dr. Eric Peterson, Director of the DCRI and expert in CVD outcomes research, includes experts in risk prediction (Pencina, co-mentor, and D'Agostino, external advisor) and risk communication (Boulware, co-mentor), all of whom will ensure scientific success and oversee the candidate's advanced training in their relative areas of expertise. By the conclusion of this program, Dr. Navar will be able to carry out advanced research in CVD prevention as an independent physician-scientist."
"9528969","?DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Einstein Aging Study (EAS) has long focused on the risk factors and cognitive changes that predict the subsequent onset of dementia, particularly Alzheimer's dementia (AD). Traditional diagnostic approaches measure cognition on single occasions. Yet, cognitive performance may vary within individuals over hours or days, resulting in single shot assessments that are influenced by unmeasured sources of within-person variability. The limited reliability, precision and ecological validity of standard assessment approaches impedes the sensitive measurement of cognitive status and change, delaying the detection of the earliest cognitive impairment in preclinical AD. The overall goal of this competing renewal is to use ambulatory methods to improve the detection and definition of the cognitive states associated with preclinical AD and to better characterize the role of novel and remediable risk factors on the preclinical onset of AD. The EAS will address these problems by leveraging recent innovations in the use of ambulatory methods. Our team has developed ambulatory methods that use mobile technology (e.g., smartphones) to assess both objective and subjective cognitive function, behavior, and psychological states in real-time and in people's naturalistic settings. The EAS has long been a community-based study; with this new proposal, we move from bringing the community into our clinic to bringing our clinic-developed measures directly to the community. We will combine these novel ambulatory cognitive measures with the team's expertise in assessing vascular function and risk factors, as well as pain and stress as they relate to cognitive health. By integrating ambulatory measurement of cognitive function (Project 3), stress and pain (Project 1) and autonomic function (Project 2), we will be able to elucidate the biological, behavioral and psychological processes that impact daily cognitive function and long-term cognitive decline. We are enthusiastic to explore the use of ambulatory assessments acquired in an individual's natural environment to improve the ecological validity of cognitive research by enhancing researchers' ability to study cognitive function and pre-clinical AD in older adults. This work will lead to a better understanding of cognitive aging and dementia and ultimately set the stage for intervention studies."

"9398177","Decades of research have highlighted the damaging effects of disadvantaged neighborhood contexts on later health outcomes, including youth antisocial behaviors (ASB) such as assault, theft, and vandalism. Although few would now contest the behavioral sequelae of neighborhood disadvantage, the mechanism(s) driving these effects are as yet unclear. Studies linking youth ASB to alterations in the function, structure, and connectivity of affect- and cognitive control-related neural regions represent a very promising possibility, since these same neural processes appear to be altered by chronically stressful experiences including disadvantage. Although potentially quite consequential, conclusions regarding the `biological embedding of disadvantage' as a pathway to ASB remain uncertain, as we have yet to either identify the specific neural mechanisms through which neighborhood disadvantage increases youth ASB or to illuminate how disadvantage alters these particular neural pathways. The current R01 application aims to do just this. We will first identify the neural regulatory control architecture (RCA) associated with both youth ASB and neighborhood disadvantage. We will then leverage the genetically-informed nature of our one-of-a-kind at-risk, longitudinal twin study to illuminate both the genetic and environmental origins of RCA and the ways in which these influences are altered by neighborhood disadvantage, both concurrently and over time. For our final set of analyses, we will explore specific proximal processes through which neighborhood disadvantage might affect neural RCA (i.e., toxicant exposure and parenting). The proposed study is thus ideally positioned to not only identify the specific neural pathways through which neighborhood disadvantage affects youth outcomes, but also to meaningfully evaluate how neighborhood disadvantage affects the developing brain. This genetically-informed developmental neuroscience approach should fundamentally advance our understanding of both the neural pathways leading to the emergence of youth ASB, and the mechanisms through which neighborhood disadvantage undermines positive development."
"9340162","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal merges developmental and chemical biology, computational analysis, and bioengineering to tackle one of the most significant challenges in hematology research-the in vitro derivation of long-term engraftable hematopoietic stem cells from pluripotent stem cells. To date, considerable efforts at directed differentiation o hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have proven only partially successful in mice and largely unsuccessful in humans. The failure to generate true ESC/iPSC-derived HSCs remains a barrier for exploiting patient-derived iPSCs for modeling blood diseases, and precludes harnessing this potentially transformative technology for therapy. This renewal application will build upon progress made during the first two years of the prior grant period to address the central question: What are the developmental pathways that drive the formation of HSCs in embryos, and how can we exploit this knowledge to direct the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells into clinically relevant hematopoietic lineages? We will apply computational algorithms to enhanced expression datasets generated by single cell RNA-seq of hematopoietic stem and progenitor populations from fish, mouse, and human. We will probe gene regulatory networks that direct hematopoietic and lymphoid development, and test candidate transcription factors, non-coding RNAs, and morphogens hypothesized to govern these networks, alone and in combination, through gain and loss-of-function strategies. In a second thrust, we will perform screens in zebrafish blastomeres and human pluripotent stem cells to discover novel chemical and biological regulators of HSCs, and will incorporate chemicals into cell differentiation protocols to drive HSC commitment and enhance HSC function. Lastly, using bioengineered platforms which mimic the biomechanical forces that act on the embryonic hemogenic endothelium, we will configure hemogenic endothelium-on-a-chip to interrogate the effectors and downstream signaling pathways that promote emergence of HSCs and expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Our efforts at defining genetic, chemical and biomechanical mechanisms in hematopoietic development represent complementary as well as synergistic strategies to solve our key challenge of deriving HSCs in vitro."

These genes are then potential therapeutic targets. The goal of the NIA Coordinating Center for Genetics and Genomics of Alzheimer's Disease (CGAD, this application) is to facilitate AD gene discovery by coordinating analysis of all AD-relevant data. As mandated by RFA AG16001, there are 3 cores and an Overall Component. The mandated cores are: 1) Administrative (Core A); 2) Data Management, Harmonization, and Information Transfer Core (Core B); and 3) Biostatistics and Data Analysis Core (Core C). As mandated by RFA AG16001, CGAD will assemble all data (Cores A and B) generated by the Alzheimer's Disease Sequence Project (ADSP) from both the Discovery Phase and the Replication Phase, and all data from non-ADSP sources (Core A) including that generated by grants funded under RFA AG16002. CGAD will; 1) create and support a collaborative network of all CGAD, ADSP, RFA AG16002, and other AD genetics investigators (Core A); 2) harmonize all genetic and phenotype data and fully annotate all variants (Core B); 2) design all harmonization and annotation protocols (Core C, implemented by Core B); 3) design analysis protocols for all data (Core C); 4) implement analyses plans (Core C, except for computationally intensive protocols that will be executed by Core B); 5) broadly distribute primary data, harmonized annotated analysis-ready files, and analyses results including depositing appropriate data into qualified access databases [National Institute on Aging Genetics of Alzheimer's Disease Storage site (NIAGADS) and database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP)] (Core B).

"9320650","ABSTRACT ? Project 3 The idea that dietary ?3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (?3 PUFAs), which are high in fish oils and other marine diet constituents, have cardioprotective and other beneficial health properties has captured the attention of the scientific community for more than a generation. Multiple mechanisms could account for the proposed health benefits of ?3 PUFAs. However, with regard to cardioprotection, there is an especially interesting mechanistic link to altered platelet function and a reduced propensity for thromboembolism. In our Alaskan Native (AN) population, many of whom still adhere to a traditional marine-based diet, we have found a strong association between the dietary ?15N biomarker and reduced platelet function. Furthermore, our preliminary data suggest that CYP4F2*3 gene variation, which defines hepatic vitamin K status, also could be a modifier of platelet response. Therefore, we have formulated the central hypothesis that both genetic and dietary factors contribute to inter-individual differences in the basal function of platelets and their response to inhibitors such as aspirin in AI/AN populations of Alaska and the Northwest. Three specific aims have been designed to test this hypothesis. In Aim 1 we will determine if the red blood cell ?15N together with genetic variation in CYP4F2 and the aspirin response gene PEAR1, are associated with inter-individual differences in plasma sP-selectin levels in a cross-section of AI/AN and non-Native populations of Alaska, Washington and Montana. Aim 2 will test whether there is a difference in platelet ?3 PUFA, thromboxane B2 and 20-HETE concentrations between individuals with extreme ?3 PUFA intake phenotypes (i.e. the 0-10 and 90-100 percentiles) and whether these associations are modified by CYP4F2 genotype. Finally, Aim 3 will determine whether, for the same stratified extremes of ?3 PUFA intake phenotype, there is a difference in platelet aggregation under basal and aspirin- treated conditions, and whether those associations are modified by CYP4F2 and PEAR1 gene variation. Collectively, these innovative studies will evaluate unique gene x environment interactions and advance our understanding of the pharmacogenomics of platelet activation and aspirin drug response in the AN community."
"9371922","Project Summary/Abstract We seek to conduct a pilot effectiveness trial within an implementation trial for improving educational outcomes of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Modeled after a Hybrid Trial Type 2 design [1], our study aims to (a) to create a valid, and locally adapted implementation training strategy leveraging the mechanisms underlying the intervention effects and delivered in priority educational settings located in urban and underserved rural contexts while also (b) considering implementation and maintenance factors impacting training, sensitivity to mechanisms, and adoption/uptake of COMPASS. The study addresses a significant research-to-practice gap that less than 10% of educational strategies for children with ASD are based on evidence [2, 3]. Importantly, consultation methods have a multiplier effect in the efficient and broad dissemination of best practices. This proposal responds to recommendations from the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee for studies that utilize ?implementation science to test methods to improve implementation of evidence-based treatments (p.41)? and develop and evaluate ?quality measures to help monitor progress in improving care and outcomes for people with ASD (p.41) [4].? Our approach aligns with recommendations from the Institute of Medicine framework for establishing evidence based standards [5] and the goals of this RFA for effectiveness research on therapeutic interventions with previously demonstrated efficacy for use in community settings. The proposed study builds on two completed NIH funded randomized controlled studies (RCTs) [6, 7], a recently published treatment manual [8] and a monograph-length scientific review [9]. The RCTs provided strong support for the efficacy of consulting delivered by the research team to assist public school special educators and parents via face-to-face interactions and through videoconferencing technology [10]. High quality ecological assessments, research-informed goal development, and guided decision-making for individualizing evidence-based interventions for children with ASD are accomplished using the consultation intervention, the Collaborative Model for Promoting Competence and Success (COMPASS) [8]. COMPASS consists of an initial parent-teacher session (3 hours) occurring near the start of the school year, followed by four 1-hour teacher coaching sessions evenly spaced through the rest of the school year. COMPASS assists in creating (1) individualized educationally appropriate, well-constructed, psychometrically- sensitive goals and (2) effective educational plans to meet the goals. Goals and teaching plans take into account the personalized context within which the evidence based interventions will be delivered. The objectives of the current proposal are to evaluate the effectiveness of training local consultants/trainers, including how well the training engages the mechanisms of change (e.g., fidelity) that have been identified and replicated in two RCTs [6,7]. The long-term goal is to improve the quality of services and overall functional and social outcomes of children with ASD when COMPASS is delivered by practitioners. Our aims are framed with the Replicating Effective Programs (REP) [11] Framework for implementation in community settings."

"9330420","ABSTRACT ? Overall Thousands of patients benefit each year from the lifesaving impacts of organ transplantation, but this benefit is hampered by the requirement of preventing rejection of the donor graft. Establishing immunologic tolerance in organ transplant recipients using life-long immunosuppressive therapy, in particular, the lymphocyte depletion immunosuppression strategy has been a critical component of all successful approaches. Following lymphocyte depletion, immune cells proliferate to fill the newly created gap in the immune repertoire, a process referred to as homeostatic repopulation. During this process the immune microenvironment critically influences the ensuing immunologic repertoire and can detour the response to allogeneic donor tissue either toward rejection or tolerance. We propose that the post-depletional fate of lymphocytes depends on its differentiation state, its exposure to antigen, and the effect of exogenous factors driving or inhibiting its growth. Within this context, we advance a generalizable framework for repopulation: recollective homeostasis, positing that the lymphocyte repertoire at any given time is determined by an ongoing process of memory acquisition and deletion. Importantly, depletion accelerates turnover, creating an intense period of opportunity during which we propose this process can be manipulated, exploiting relative differences in cell susceptibility to create, over time, a state of sustained allospecific hypo-responsiveness. This proposal seeks to capitalize on this window of opportunity to reshape the immune repertoire towards tolerance through the work of two interrelated projects investigating specific repopulation events supported by an administrative core and a scientific core for immune profiling. Project 1 will focus on depletional T lymphocyte repopulation, while Project 2 will focus on B lymphocyte/plasma cell/antibody modulation. These projects are scientifically distinct but are interactive in methodologies and mechanisms. Specifically, both projects will employ our major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-defined, nonhuman primate (NHP) renal transplantation model that provides rigorous translational evaluation of potential novel tolerance induction strategies. Homeostatic repopulation is a central theme in our work that serves to generalize our approach beyond tolerance protocols, to broader immunosuppressant- and viral-induced lymphopenic states. This proposal will also improve upon our understanding of the role of costimulation blockade and the drug belatacept in tolerance induction; their ability to enhance the specificity and tolerability of anti-rejection therapy and to downregulate alloantibody has been a longstanding focus of our research. Our proposed studies will build on two decades of collaborative experience investigating both depletion and costimulation blockade in NHPs. The knowledge gained from these studies will further our understanding of tolerance mechanisms in NHPs and humans, extend our understanding of T and B cell biology, and deepen our understanding of transplant immunosuppression."

The G2 offspring have a variety of Healthy Aging Phenotypes (HAPs), defined as an unusually low age-specific prevalence of one or more specific conditions or risk factors, compared to population-based cohorts suggesting enrichment of shared (possibly genetic) protective effects in LLFS families. In the second funding period (2010-2013), we conducted a 2.5 million SNP GWAS (dbGaP phs000397); developed a high-throughput technique and sequenced ~450 candidate genes and replicated many variants and found additional ones associated with Healthy Aging Phenotypes (HAP) and longevity. 54% of LLFS G1 and 92% of G2 remain alive. Participant retention has been 94%. We now propose a third funding period to conduct a second in-person examination (V2) to prospectively study rates of change in HAPs with age and identify genetic and other factors contributing to HAPs and longevity. We hypothesize that EL and HAPs entail common and rare variants that individually have modest effects, but which in combinations strongly influence longevity and specific HAPs, and may only be detectable in family studies enriched for HAPs, such as LLFS. HAPs evaluated at the initial in-person visit show strong linkage peaks which are not explained by common haplotypes interrogated by GWAS (HLODs ranging from 6.0-45.1). These are likely driven by rare, lineage-private alleles that will only be found by sequencing specific families, and may point to important new biology. Specific Aim 1 is to conduct a second in-home examination on all surviving LLFS participants. Specific Aim 2 is to analyze cross-sectional and longitudinal phenotypes. The goal is to identify pathways for EL and HAPs by characterizing the shared and distinct LLFS phenotypes and environmental factors. We will characterize individual longitudinal patterns of HAPs to identify subgroups showing similar patterns and exceptional phenotypes. We will test whether these HAPs are heritable, and test for differences with internal and external referent groups. Specific Aim 3 is to find genes/variants associated with cross-sectional and longitudinal phenotypes using a) Whole Exome Sequencing to comprehensively search for coding variants associated with HAPs and EL and b) Targeted Regulatory Sequencing of regions under linkage peaks for HAPs in selected families showing the strongest linkage evidence. Specific Aim 4 is to replicate our genetic and epidemiological findings in other aging study cohorts. This study could lead to the discovery of pathways and potential therapeutic/prevention targets affecting HAPs and EL. A Data Management and Coordinating Center and 4 Field Centers comprise the major components of the LLFS.

"9322008","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Significance. We aim to determine the essential structural and thermodynamic features which govern enzymatic nitric oxide detoxification. We use a cycle of computational design and biochemical analysis of an artificial nitric oxide dioxygenase (NOD) formed by combining an artificial heme-based oxygen binding protein domain with a flavoprotein reductase domain derived from nature. Use of such a robust, simple protein makes it significantly easier to make both small- and large-scale changes to the protein and positively identify critical features necessary for enzyme function. Nitric oxide plays a central role in many signaling process in human biology, yet due to its degree of chemical reactivity it has also been implicated in a surprising number of serious disorders such as Lou Gehrig's Disease and ischemic brain injury. A superior nitric oxide dioxygenase thus promises to be useful in future treatments of many pathological conditions. Conversely, unwanted NOD activity has produced severe complications in hemoglobin-based blood substitutes, and it is important to learn how to reduce or eliminate NOD activity in these therapeutics without adversely affecting oxygen binding. Innovation. This catalytic construct represents the next generation in protein design, moving design technology from the current focus on simple protein domains with single cofactors to significantly more challenging and sophisticated multidomain structures that more closely resemble the complex assemblies seen in nature. This project has the capacity to dramatically advance two important technologies: hemoglobin-based blood substitutes and enzyme therapeutics. First, lessons learned in this project promise to revitalize the field of hemoglobin-based blood substitutes, enabling both the reengineering of native hemoglobins and the creation of entirely new oxygen transport proteins minimally reactive with nitric oxide while still carrying oxygen. Second, a synthetic enzyme has the potential to transform the field of enzyme therapy because of the many advantages designed enzymes have over their natural counterparts, most importantly the ability to utilize non-natural cofactors better optimized for the target activity and their greatly increased stability over natural protein (53). This project thus represents a new direction in enzyme therapy, and our design pathway is an enabling technology which will be used by us and others in the creation of future enzyme therapeutics. Specific Aims. This work will allow us to answer some important questions about this enzyme: Aim 1. What role does the heme reduction potential play in the nitric oxide dioxygenase reaction? Aim 2. How important are electron transfer dynamics and thermodynamics in this reaction? Aim 3. How do protein dynamics and structure govern NOD function?"
"9260369","OVERALL ? SUMMARY The UNM Metal Exposure and Toxicity Assessment on Tribal Lands in the Southwest (METALS) Superfund Research Program (SRP) and Training Center will focus on risk reduction for Native Americans exposed to hazardous metals mixtures from abandoned uranium mine waste. This will be the ONLY SRP Center focused on risks to Native American communities. Specifically, UNM METALS will focus on site-specific physical/mineralogic/biogeochemical properties of the waste that alter immune function and DNA repair in tribal populations. The biomedical research proposed in UNM METALS focuses on major uncertainties in these exposure:outcome relationships, while environmental projects complement this research by exploiting characteristics that impact mobility and toxicity to develop and test novel cost-effective metals immobilization and removal strategies to reduce risks in ways compatible with tribal culture, and design risk avoidance/warning systems. Recognizing that complete remediation of these sites under CERCLA remains decades away, METALS will use multi-directional community engagement and research translation cores to develop and implement trans-generational approaches to risk communication and risk avoidance that integrate indigenous learning models (e.g. tribal ecological knowledge) and Western science. The METALS Center will integrate training of junior faculty and graduate students with multi-directional training of community members and research staff so that local knowledge of mining impacts and health problems inform air and water monitoring needs to support the environmental and biomedical research projects and build a foundation of transdisciplinary, partnered research for the next generation. METALS will utilize committed pilot funding from the UNM Cancer Center, the HSC Research Office, and our Environmental Health Signature Program to build transdisicplinary partnerships that expand our team to respond to additional health outcomes of community concern. The Center will expand ongoing, developed partnerships with three Native American communities living in close proximity to unique waste sites. The first is Laguna Pueblo living with the abandoned > 8000 acre openpit Jackpile Mine listed on the Superfund National Priorities List, and two Navajo communities living in proximity to two separate sites being addressed through CERCLA assessment as part of the USEPA Congressionally mandated Five-Year Plan to Address Uranium Contamination on the Navajo Nation: Red Water Pond Road adjacent to the North East Church Rock Mine; and Tachee-Blue Gap community living next to the Claim 28 waste site. In summary, we will work closely with communities, tribal and federal agencies to develop informed Superfund prioritization based on site-specific factors identified through our research, and develop solutions that build on site properties to immobilize and remove metals, reduce risk in ways that are holistic, predictable and sustainable, and test biological interventions to reduce toxicity."

"9319729","PROJECT 1 - Spinal cord injury (SCI) leads to detrusor-sphincter-dyssynergia, bladder overdistension and dramatic remodeling of the bladder wall and neurons that innervate the organ. These contribute to the development of detrusor overactivity. Project 1 will focus on the role of afferent sensitization, remodeling and increased neuropeptide release as well as interstitial cell (IC) hyperplasia following thoracic level (T8-T9) spinal cord transection (i.e., SCI) in mice. In addition, we will test potential therapeutic agents that target afferent nerves, IC and nerve growth factor (NGF). There are three specific aims. Aim 1 will measure afferent sprouting, sensitization and neuropeptide release which, our data suggest, is more predominant in the trigone. This will be achieved through the use of our unique optical mapping approaches and bladder sheet preparations combined with afferent nerve recordings/stimulation. We will inject,pseudorabies virus, genetically encoded with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator,GCaMP4, into the dorsal root ganglia to selectively label bladder afferent nerves. Aim 2 will examine the role of IC as pacemakers that drive spontaneous contractions that may contribute to detrusor overactivity following SCI. We hypothesize that nitric oxide released from the urothelium, which normally attenuates IC firing, is insufficient due to SCI-induced IC hyperplasia. This theory will be tested in bladder wall-cross sections utilizing optical mapping with high- resolution CMOS cameras that can differentiate the individual cell layers within the bladder wall. Aim 3 will investigate the therapeutic benefits of botulinum neurotoxin serotype-A, p3-adrenergic receptor agonists, PDE-5 inhibitors and nen/e growth factor antibodies (NGF-AB). These agents have been shown to have beneficial effects on the bladder and we propose to determine if this is through direct actions on afferent nerves and/or IC. We believe that the combination of unique approaches, preparations and interactions with the other projects will help clarify the mechanisms responsible for SCI-induced dysfunction and uncover new therapies for its treatment. RELEVANCE (See instructions): It is very important to develop a better understanding of the mechanisms that drive afferent sensitization and interstitial cell overactivity following spinal cord injury, as these may lead to new therapeutic approaches and optimization of existing ones to decrease detrusor overactivity and treat urinary incontinence."
"9438704","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic disease and decreased mobility associated with obesity in older (65+ yrs) adults emphasize the urgent need to identify obesity treatments in this population that are evidenced-based, effective in the long-term, and perhaps age-specific. The latest obesity treatment guidelines for all ages recommend an intensive intervention involving behavioral counseling, caloric restriction, and increased physical activity to achieve weight loss. However weight regain after treatment cessation is very common, especially in older adults in whom the currently recommended strategy of continued performance of high-volume structured exercise of 200-300 min/wk may be less feasible and effective. A key factor contributing to weight regain is the decrease in energy expenditure that occurs in response to weight loss, due mainly to a decline in non-exercise or spontaneous physical activity (SPA) that is the direct result of an increase in sedentary behavior (SB), or time spent sitting or reclining. Our pilot data show that decreases in SPA predict magnitude of weight regain. Since older adults spend 65-80% of their waking day sitting or prone, we hypothesize that intervening on SB will be a more effective method for preventing weight regain than the conventional approach of intervening on exercise behavior in this age group. The proposed research will test the efficacy of a novel, acceptable, behavioral intervention (SitLess) that focuses on increased awareness of SB employing inclinometer-based self-monitoring throughout the day. Our pilot data show that this intervention may improve weight loss during the intensive phase of treatment and prevents weight regain during a short (5-month) follow-up phase. The primary aim of this study is to determine whether addition of this intervention that targets SB to a conventional weight loss intervention that targets exercise results in lower long-term reduction in weight in older, obese adults. This will be accomplished with a 24-month trial in 225 obese (BMI=30-40 kg/m2) older (65-79 yrs) adults randomized to one of three treatments (n=75), all with dietary caloric restriction plus either: 1) moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (WL+EX); 2) intervening on SB (WL+SitLess); or 3) (WL+EX+SitLess). The primary hypothesis is that: WL+EX+SitLess will have lower 24-month body weight than either WL+EX or WL+SitLess. Secondary outcomes, including resting and physical activity energy expenditure, SB, dietary intake and appetite, body composition/bone density, physical function, cardiometabolic risk and intervention process measures, will also be examined. The results will provide the first randomized, controlled trial data on the efficacy of self-monitoring of a key contributor to the adaptive thermogenic response to weight loss. Increasing awareness of weight loss-induced reductions in SPA, and behavioral promotion of decreasing SB to counteract these reductions, may provide for a more effective, safe, non- pharmacologic, and sustainable strategy to reduce weight regain after weight loss in older adults."

"9325063","H. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Remarkable advances in understanding of the pathophysiology of acute, life-threatening disorders have occurred in the past several decades. However, there are too few clinical investigators who can translate these research findings into improved care, making it critical to create and maintain a cadre of emergency care clinician-scientists. Innovative programs are needed to identify, train, and support such individuals. Vanderbilt has an extremely successful history in developing the careers of clinician-scientists. One such program is the Vanderbilt Emergency Medicine Research Training Program, a K12 program funded in 2011 to develop clinician-scientists in emergency care. Of the 7 Scholars in this program, 3 have successfully obtained external K23 funding, and 3 have K23 applications under review or in preparation in 2015. In response to RFA-HL-16- 019, we propose to extend our successful K12 program by leveraging: 1) a dedicated and senior mentorship team; 2) a diverse Scholar roster; 3) strong collaboration between the Departments of Medicine, Emergency Medicine, and Psychiatry, and the School of Nursing, all located on a single campus; 4) an environment with a rich history of highly successful clinical-scientist training and career development; 5) a robust infrastructure for clinical and translational research; and 6) strong institutional support. We propose to recruit a total of 6 clinician-scientists who have completed residency (or those with PhDs or equivalent training) and who show exceptional aptitude for successfully pursuing an academic research career. The program will concentrate on developing expertise in 3 core areas: acute cardiopulmonary emergencies, the neurobiology of acute psychiatric illness, and patient-centered emergency nursing. The Program Directors, Alan B. Storrow, MD and Thomas J. Wang, MD, have assembled a team of experts in each focus area who are currently engaged in successful academic research and who have devoted their careers to training and mentoring new investigators. Both early-career (Mentors-in-Training) and senior investigators (Primary Research Mentors) will combine with experts in career development (Academic Mentors) to support the Scholars toward independent careers in emergency care research."

"9321155","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Strategies for addressing intractable disparities in the early development of African American infants must involve meaningful and sustained father engagement. Poor African American infants born to unmarried uncoupled parents are more likely to have such a presence by fathers if their parents create a positive coparenting alliance early on. No empirically-validated prenatal interventions that successfully encourage unmarried fathers and mothers to intentionally create enduring alliances in their babies' best interest currently exist. This R01 tests through RCT methodology efficacy of a new intervention designed specifically to aid development of positive coparenting alliances between at-risk (unmarried, uncoupled, low income) African American mothers and fathers having a first baby together. A feasibility pilot study Figuring It Out for the Child (FIOC) that enjoined affirmatio and support from key African American stakeholders in St. Petersburg, Florida's health and human service and faith-based communities positions a field-ready to team to meet the considerable challenges of recruitment, retention and successful implementation of the intervention. Seventy-five randomly-assigned control group families will receive county services as-usual for pregnant parents and assistance of the partnering health and human service agencies with referrals to desired services, while 75 experimental group families will receive the same services and aid, plus a 6-session prenatal intervention with a post-natal booster session. The intervention addresses the importance of safe, healthy families for early infant development, the impact a cooperative and sustained coparenting alliance can have in promoting positive infant development, challenges unmarried parents face cultivating a coparenting alliance together when their commitment to one another as romantic or married partners is in doubt, and ways to surmount these obstacles, maintain rapport, and sustain a strong alliance. All 150 participating families, both at intake (prior to the intervention) and the again at 3 and 12 months post-partum, will report beliefs about fatherhood; extent of depressive symptomatology; and quality of the mother-father partnership. State-of-the-field coparenting observations will be conducted at each follow-up, along with measures of parental stress, domestic violence, perceived coparenting support, father engagement, and infant socioemotional adjustment. Analyses will examine impact of the intervention on promoting more supportive, coordinated post-partum coparenting alliances and more positive adult and infant outcomes. Exploratory analyses will examine questions relevant to father associations with child adjustment and whether this coparent intervention can reduce domestic violence."

"9353941","Abstract Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected individuals globally. The majority of HIV-negative individuals infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) are asymptomatic, and are considered to have latent TB infection (LTBI), providing compelling evidence for host immune control of infection. Co-infection with HIV increases the risk of progressing to active TB disease (ATB) by over 20 fold but the underlying immune mechanisms remain unclear. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) decreases the incidence of ATB in HIV-infected individuals and remains the cornerstone of HIV care. However, the incidence of TB in HIV-coinfected individuals remains 4- to 7-fold higher after ART than in HIV-uninfected people in TB-endemic settings, regardless of the duration of ART or attainment of high CD4 counts. Thus, immune control of Mtb infection is not fully restored by ART. Recent clinical trials have shown that regimens that concurrently administer Isoniazid Preventive Treatment (IPT) and ART are significantly better than ART alone in reducing TB incidence among individuals with LTBI. However, uptake of concurrent ART and IPT regimens remains poor and the immune mechanisms underlying the benefits of concurrent ART and IPT have not been defined. We propose to identify the components of TB immunity in the blood and lung compartments that remain impaired after ART, versus those that are restored by concurrent ART and IPT, in the rhesus macaque nonhuman primate (NHP) aerosol model of LTBI and Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) co-infection. We hypothesize that co-infection with SIV increases Mtb burden within alveolar macrophages in the lung and progressively impairs the functional capacities of tissue-resident Mtb-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells in the lung; ART only partially restores these functions. We further hypothesize that IPT-mediated reduction in Mtb burden, in conjunction with ART, enhances protective Mtb-specific T cell immunity compared to ART alone. We will model these concurrent regimens in a highly faithful model of Mtb/HIV co-infection in rhesus macaques to study the kinetics of lung-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses by longitudinal sampling of blood, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and lung biopsy tissue. In Aim 1 we will investigate the role of tissue-resident CD4 T cells in reconstituting Mtb-specific immunity after concurrent ART/IPT regimens versus ART alone. In Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that SIV-induced progressive impairment of Mtb-specific CD8 functions in lung compartments are better restored by concurrent ART/IPT regimens than by ART alone. By identifying mechanisms underlying restoration of Mtb-specific immune function after concurrent ART and IPT, our studies have the potential to provide new insights into immune pathways that can be targeted for host-directed adjunctive therapies for TB/HIV co-infection and incorporated into designing better vaccines for TB."

For example, the sparse reconstruction matlab code has been downloaded 1840 times in the last year and half, and the paper describing these algorithms is the most downloaded paper over the last five years in Magnetic Resonance in Medicine, the leading journal for MR imaging research."
"9384963","Project Summary/Abstract  Mobile phones and devices, with their constant presence, data connectivity, and multiple embedded sensors, are producing tremendous amounts of data that can provide fine-grained moment-by-moment views of physiologic, environmental, and behavioral features of health and disease states. Such mobile health (mHealth) data are particularly valuable for understanding complex multifactorial diseases, but only if the mHealth data can be combined with electronic health record (EHR), genomic and other data for discovery and health improvement. mHealth data interoperability through data and metadata standards is thus a necessity.  With the wearables market projected to triple in size by 2021 and with NIH projects on ?mobile health? skyrocketing, now is the time for the mHealth ecosystem to adopt a common data standard. Open mHealth is the only existing open mHealth data standard. It fills the standards gap for sensor and personally-generated mHealth data by complementing lower-level device standards (e.g., IEEE 11703) and EHR data standards (e.g., HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)). Open mHealth is being used by companies and research consortia such as BD2K and PCORnet, and has a global user community of ~6000 people. The goal of this project is to drive Open mHealth adoption past the tipping point to become the dominant mHealth data standard and increase the value of mHealth for research and care. We will drive a feedback loop of adoption by data producers (e.g., developers, device makers) and data consumers (e.g., health systems) by adding provenance metadata to Open mHealth, and by officially engaging with the main standards organizations for these groups: IEEE for data producers and HL7 for data consumers. Our Specific Aims are:  Aim 1: Increase Open mHealth?s scientific value by expanding engagement with researchers We will extend Open mHealth schemas and tools, and support the mProv provenance metadata approach. Aim 2: Secure IEEE certification through extensive engagement with the developer community following the IEEE Standards Development process. Aim 3: Develop an official HL7 FHIR mHealth Implementation Guide and test it via an open testbed through deep engagement with health IT and clinical communities. Aim 4: Promote and ensure discoverability and adoption by all user communities by placing our standards into relevant data and metadata standards repositories and conducting ongoing outreach, engagement and promotion to new and evolving communities. Aim 5: Ensure sustainability of the standard through the Open mHealth non-profit organization by developing representative community governance, and expanding corporate sponsorships and partnerships. All software produced will be open sourced.  Achievement of our Aims will catalyze broad Open mHealth adoption by mHealth data producers and consumers across the health ecosystem, which through network effects of data interoperability will maximize the value of mHealth data to speed discovery and enable more continuous, integrated, and personalized care."
"9370807","Project Summary: High quality evidence supports medication assisted treatment (MAT) as the first line treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD), especially opioid substitution therapy with buprenorphine or methadone as long-term maintenance of at least one year. Yet patient dropout (typically >50% at six months), and provider resistance remain major impediments to effective treatment. To date, few studies have examined patient characteristics that influence key steps in treatment initiation, stabilization, and long-term retention with buprenorphine. Most published studies assess outcomes for only 2-3 months of active treatment among highly selected patients in clinical trials. I will draw from the influential, sequential ?cascade of care? framework from the HIV/AIDS field as a conceptual model to identify stage-specific barriers to continuity of buprenorphine treatment through an adapted OUD treatment cascade. A greater understanding of barriers at each sequential stage of the cascade including 1) initiation of buprenorphine, 2) stabilization of opioid use, and 3) retention with long-term treatment response, may inform clinical efforts to improve outcomes and mortality.  Under healthcare reform and Medicaid redesign, increasing numbers of patients receive insurance reimbursement for substance abuse treatment. I propose to link clinical data from electronic health records (EHR) to insurance claims data to assess patient factors that promote continuity of care along the cascade. This strategy will capture critical information (ED visits, diagnoses, treatment services, mortality) that are outside of a given clinical site's records. Insurance claims data have the advantage of providing near complete follow up and objective outcomes that do not rely on self-report and reflect real-world clinical complexities.  In order to accomplish these goals and achieve my long-term training objectives of developing expertise in quantitative methods, epidemiology, and the management and inferential analysis of large observational data sets, I have articulated five sequential training goals: 1) epidemiologic and statistical data analysis methods 2) services research, program evaluation, and model design 3) insurance claims data analysis 4) inferential methods with observational data, and 5) grant writing and administration. To fulfill my research aims, I will incorporate electronic records from a high-volume, multi-site MAT provider that has started 18,000 patients on buprenorphine since 2009 with frequent in-house urine drug testing. The research will identify patient characteristics associated with successful buprenorphine initiation, stabilization, and retention and will model barriers at each stage of the treatment cascade. With these findings, I also seek to evaluate the clinical utility of each stage by modeling associations between attaining each stage of treatment and improved clinical outcomes. The results, which will be based on a large, highly generalizable, community-based sample of adults with OUD presenting for treatment, will evaluate the clinical consequences of long-term MAT maintenance and help guide quality improvement initiatives."
"9391482","Project Summary/Abstract Ion Trap Sequential Mass Spectrometry (IT-MSn) based sequencing has been proven a powerful technology for detailed carbohydrate structural characterization. Different from many traditional oligosaccharide analysis strategies, MSn sequencing does not depend on glycan biosynthesis rules, or inferential data. This unique feature is particularly beneficial in studying abnormal glycosylation in diseases, or engineering glycotherapeutics glycosylation machinery in non-conventional expression systems, because glycosylation in these systems are less studied, biosynthesis rules established from model systems may not be applicable any more. The appreciation of the value provided by MSn sequencing keeps growing in both academia and industry. Nevertheless, the steep learning curve of MSn sequencing has been hindering the wide adaptation of the technology. This laboratory has pioneered this glycan sequencing technology and is uniquely positioned to advance and disseminate this approach to the glycobiology community. In an attempt to flatten the learning curve, we propose four Specific Aims in the application: (A) to expand MSn library collection and build a web portal to enable web access; (B) to develop an integrated software system for automating MSn glyco-epitope identification; (C) to seek synergy with traditional oligosaccharide structural analysis strategies; (D) to extend detailed MSn sequencing to cover glycosaminoglycan (GAG) related polymers. The deliverables of the proposed projects will be a set of software tools and established lab protocols that enable non-specialized biomedical labs to conduct detailed carbohydrate characterization using MSn sequencing. We believe the proposed developments are in line with the RFA-RM-16-023, and will accelerate the diffusion of the technology."
"9394569","Project Summary Infants are faced with the task of learning language in noisy environments. It is well known that infants have greater difficulties listening in noisy situations than adults, even though their ability to encode sounds appears to be mature. One possible explanation is that infants have greater difficulties segregating simultaneous sounds. The sound components of different sound sources arrive at the ears as a complex sound mixture. The task of the auditory system is to group sound components together that belong to the same sound source and separate those that do not. Adults accomplish this task by using a variety of auditory cues, such as frequency proximity or onset asynchrony. Central processes and selective auditory attention also play an important role. Evidence on how infants solve this task is sparse but indicates that infants are able to use some of the same auditory cues that adults use. However, temporal cues, which are strong cues to sound source segregation in adults, have not been investigated in infants. Given that central auditory processes develop rapidly within the first year of life developmental differences would be expected. The overall goal of this research is to test hypotheses about infants' ability to use auditory cues to separate concurrent sounds. The observer-based psychoacoustic procedure and a modified double-vowel paradigm will be used. Three- and 7- month-old typically developing infants and adults will be included. The first specific aim of this research is to investigate whether infants are able to use two different temporal cues to segregate concurrent speech sounds. The cues that will be investigated are onset asynchrony and amplitude modulation. It is expected that infants and adults will be able to separate concurrent speech sounds better with a temporal cue and that this ability will increase with age. In infants, amplitude modulation is expected to improve vowel segregation more than onset asynchrony, a pattern not expected for adults. In addition to investigating isolated cues, this research will also test how infants use cue combinations. Natural environments typically include a multitude of auditory cues and adults change the cues they use based on what cues are available. The second specific aim of this research is to investigate how infants and adults weigh onset asynchrony and amplitude modulation when both cues are available. It is expected that infants and adults will be better able to segregate the simultaneous speech sounds when two cues are available, and that the benefit of combining cues is relatively greater for infants than for adults. The results of this research will contribute to the growing understanding of the development of auditory skills in complex listening environments. Furthermore, the results will lay the groundwork to investigate how auditory development in infants with hearing loss differs from infants with typical hearing. This can lead to the development of better treatment and intervention approaches."
"9386603","PROJECT SUMMARY Health disparities among aging African Americans and Latinos are substantial and persistent. 1 With large segments of these populations living in poverty, healthcare access and quality are major contributors to their disproportionate burdens of disease, disability, and death. Yet, African American and Latino later life health disparities persist even in higher socioeconomic contexts. 2 This suggests that, in addition to economic barriers, there are psychosocial barriers to healthcare resource use, or utilization, and, thus, good health among aging minorities. The purpose of the proposed career development and research is to provide new understanding of later life health disparities by examining a previously overlooked psychosocial barrier to care among aging minorities, namely healthcare stereotype threat (HCST), 3-9 and how it can be ameliorated. Stereotype threat is the threat of being personally reduced to a group stereotype, 10-13 which can lead individuals to avoid stereotype-relevant domains. 10-12 For example, females have been shown to avoid STEM fields, leadership roles, and other stereotypically male domains to avoid stereotypes of inferiority and their negative social and psychological consequences. 14,15 My central hypothesis is that stereotypes regarding unhealthy lifestyles, low status, and inferior intelligence are salient for aging minorities in healthcare settings and influence healthcare resource use and health outcomes. The first of its kind, the proposed research will investigate the research questions of whether and how HCST contributes to disparities in healthcare resource use and health in aging African Americans and Latinos as compared to Whites. The approach is informed by Stereotype Threat Theory3,9,10,16,17 and my Culture and Social Identity Health Theory. 18 Specific Aims are threefold: (1) To document the association of ethnicity/race-based and age-based HCST to cross- sectional and longitudinal healthcare resource use and health outcomes among African American, Latino, and White older adults; (2) To use randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine economic and other moderators of the link between HCST and perceptions of the healthcare environment, including healthcare resource quality; and (3) To use RCT to examine how matching patients and physicians on race/ethnicity and/or age impacts the association between HCST and perceptions of healthcare resource quality. The proposed research design consists of three studies, employs a combination of survey and experimental methods, and involves both primary data collection and secondary data analysis. An assistant professor of Gerontology and Psychology at the University of Southern California, I (Candidate: Abdou) possess interdisciplinary expertise in psychology, social epidemiology, population health, and lifespan and intergenerational health disparities. This NIA K01 will provide the unique opportunity to augment my current expertise with training in health economics, health services research, and advanced training in stereotype threat and statistical and research methods (i.e., longitudinal data, RCT). Alongside my strong interdisciplinary mentorship team, I will receive the necessary support and training to work toward my long-term career goal of establishing an independent research program, including development of a successful NIH R01, to reduce later life health disparities and improve minority aging through the reduction of HCST and its sociocultural and psychobiological consequences."
"9346483","Project Summary/Abstract This Phase I SBIR proposes to develop and demonstrate the feasibility of an innovative computer-based program for training therapists to administer Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics (CBIT); an empirically supported nonpharmacological intervention for children and adults with Chronic Tic Disorders (CTD; including Tourette Disorder). CTD represents a class of neuropsychiatric disorders, occurring in 1-3% of the population that can lead to significant impairments in physical, social, academic, and interpersonal functioning and reduced quality of life. There is currently no cure for CTD, however in large-scale randomized controlled trials, CBIT has been shown to reduce tics without the adverse side effects associated with pharmacotherapy. A therapist-guided, empirically validated CBIT protocol is available, however the vast majority of individuals who desire CBIT do not have access to therapists trained in the delivery of this intervention. Given the need for nonpharmacological treatment options for individuals with CTD, a desire for such treatments by potential end-users, and the absence of practitioners adequately trained in the treatment, there is a clear need for innovative modes of dissemination. The current proposal partners two of the primary developers of CBIT with PsycTech, a company that specializes in developing effective computer-based products for repetitive behavior disorders. In the proposed project, we will use competency-based training methods and an innovative, contextualized technology adaptation process (CTAP) to adapt CBIT into an innovative online training program; a process that has been shown to increase satisfaction and adoption among stakeholders. In addition, to inform implementation, we will use an established conceptual model of evidence-based practice implementation whereby we will engage multiple stakeholders early in the product development process in order to begin to identify provider-level factors (e.g., attitudes, values, openness) and organizational-level factors (e.g., priorities, values, structural fit) shown to influence adoption and implementation of adapted interventions in other health-care models and settings. The resulting product (CBIT- Trainer) will be tested for feasibility, usability, and end-user satisfaction. This Phase I project will accomplish four aims: (1) To develop CBIT-Trainer concept materials and program flow through an iterative end-user feedback and development process; (2) To develop working online prototypes to train two core CBIT therapeutic techniques: education training and HRT; (3) To conduct usability, acceptability, and feasibility tests on the education and HRT CBIT-Trainer prototypes using CBIT-naïve therapists; and (4) identify, early in the development process, provider and organizational factors that could impede adoption and implementation. !"
"9365386","Project Summary One hallmark feature of chronic heart failure (CHF) is sodium and fluid retention. While the cardio-renal syndrome has been recognized, a comprehensive understanding of the precise cellular mechanisms contributing to sodium and water retention in CHF remains elusive. Renal denervation (RDN) has been shown to reduce sodium retention in rats and dogs with CHF. One of the key elements involved in renal sodium retention is activation of epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) of principal cells in the collecting tubule. We have previously shown that ENaC subunit expressions and activity were increased in the kidneys from rats with CHF. We have recent evidence indicating that increased proteases in the tubular fluid may contribute to the enhanced renal ENaC activity, providing a novel mechanistic insight for sodium retention commonly observed in CHF. We have observed that in rats with CHF: 1) the levels of serine proteases were dramatically increased in the urine; 2) protease inhibitor treatment significantly abrogated the enhanced diuretic and natriuretic responses to ENaC inhibitor benzamil in rats with CHF. Furthermore, our preliminary data have shown that RDN decreased the levels of proteases in the urine, reduced protein expressions of ENaC subunits in the kidney of CHF rats, supporting the potential role of sympathetic nerve activation. Based on these data, we will test the hypothesis that RDN reduces renal sodium retention in CHF rats by modulation of the ENaC and protease-ENaC axis. In AIM 1 we will determine the contribution of RDN in the expression/inactivation of ENaC in rats with CHF rats. In AIM 2 we will determine the contribution of tubular proteases in activating ENaC in rats with CHF. These aims will be addressed in rats with CHF using complementary methodologies ranging from cellular to the whole animal level, including physiological measurement of sodium balance, ENaC activity, eletrophysiological recording, protease and ubiquitination of ENaC using molecular biology techniques. The successful completion of the proposed studies will provide significant new information and insight into the contribution of ENaC regulation in altered sodium balance in CHF and the therapeutic benefits of RDN on sodium fluid retention, endemic to CHF."
"9269204","From its inception, CAMRT has developed innovative neuroimaging methodology for use by our collaborators and service users as well as the community at large through dissemination and training. When we started doing fMRI research in 1993, our scanner did not have EPI-capable gradients, and we were forced to innovate. We found that spiral trajectories being developed by our colleagues in EE were highly efficient, and enabled us to collect excellent timeseries images with several shots instead of the 64 or more needed with conventional Cartesian methods. Thus, when CAMRT began in 1995 we continued to evolve innovative acquisition and analysis techniques, such as real-time fMRI and sparsely sampled acquisitions, driven by collaborators in the neurosciences and other cognitive biomedical fields. We demonstrated strong advantages to our spiral sequences over the more ubiquitous EPI techniques, and they are in use for tens of thousands of scans/year in our center and elsewhere. We became highly regarded by the extramural community for our technology (our top 5 fMRI papers in Google Scholar together have over 3000 citations), and have disseminated broadly. Building on our sound record of impact in fMRI and other neuroimaging methods for cognitive exploration, and motivated by investigators asking increasingly complex questions about the brain, we propose to develop fMRI acquisition techniques with higher spatiotemporal resolution, introduce highly novel array methods for neuromodulation of brain networks using both TMS and tDCS, and augment our DTI technology with new susceptibility weighted methods. These goals are highly consistent with the Grand Challenges in Neuroimaging identified by an NSF Workshop called in response to the BRAIN research initiative introduced by President Obama in 2013. We will also maintain our support of outside investigators through dissemination of pulse sequences, reconstruction methods and other software, and continue to train students and our users in state of the art neuroimaging technology."

The mandate of  the Program is to encourage, facilitate, and support the best research and training in cancer immunology, and  to translate basic findings from CIP laboratories into pre-clinical studies within the Program and to clinical  studies through inter-programmatic collaborations with UPCI disease-site programs. CIP research is centered  on three themes: 1) cancer immunology and tumor microenvironment; 2) cancer immunotherapy; and 3)  cancer immunoprevention. The specific aims of the CIP are to: 1) promote and support interdisciplinary  research on the role of innate and adaptive immunity in creating a tumor-promoting versus tumor-suppressing  microenvironment; 2) perform preclinical studies of novel cancer immunotherapies and collaborate with clinical  programs to translate these approaches to the bedside; 3) promote and support research on cancer  immunosurveillance, including the generation of relevant animal models for testing the ability of the immune  system to control progression of premalignant disease to cancer; and 4) promote programs and grant  submissions for educating and training the next generation of basic and translational cancer immunologists.  The CIP includes 29 members from 7 departments and 1 school recruited from the large group of  immunologists at the University of Pittsburgh. CIP members currently receive $6.9 M annually in direct funding,  including $2.4 M from the NCI and $4.2 M in other peer-reviewed support. Between January 2010 and April  2014, CIP members authored 530 cancer-related publications, of which 30% resulted from intra-programmatic  and 45% from inter-programmatic collaborations. Approximately 33% of the papers represent collaborations  with external investigators. CIP facilitates UPCI-wide distribution communication of best science discoveries  through seminars and retreats and through collaborations with members of other UPCI Programs. CIP leaders  assist program members in identifying and acquiring relevant resources and support, through work-in-progress  meetings, validation of preclinical findings in clinical specimens, identifying pilot funding, and championing the  translational hand-off to disease-site programs. These efforts have produced successful translational research  leading to early phase trials of novel agents and combinations based on discoveries of CIP members.

"9301759","Project Summary/Abstract The NICHD has identified bullying as a significant public health concern and, through the Social and Emotional Development/Child and Family Process Program, supports research on the processes that contribute to, or discourage, bullying among youth. The research proposed here will test a novel approach to increase children?s defending of victims of bullying. Previous research has shown that the presence of defenders leads to decreases in bullying. Thus, promoting defending has become a critical component of anti-bullying interventions. However, how to best motivate defending has been relatively unstudied. Deviance Regulation Theory (DRT) provides a theoretical basis for motivating positive health and social behaviors. This theory proposes that individuals are motivated to behave in ways that differentiate them from others in a positive manner. Accordingly, individuals will be motivated to engage in a behavior if they believe the behavior occurs infrequently and will be viewed positively by others. As children report that few of their peers defend victims of bullying, the goal of this study is to increase defending by communicating to children that defenders possess traits valued by their peers (e.g., being popular, kind). Children in 4th-grade and 5th-grade classrooms will receive a DRT- based anti-bullying intervention or an anti-bullying intervention focused on increasing empathy for victims and strategies for defending peers. Data collection will occur three times during the school year: a) at baseline, two weeks prior to the intervention; b) 3 months post-intervention; and c) 6 months post-intervention. Findings will show whether, compared to the traditional anti- bullying intervention, the DRT-based intervention results in larger, more sustained gains in defending. The study will also examine whether gains in defending are greatest among children who have low perceived norms for defending and, therefore, would otherwise be the least likely to stand up for victims. Other factors that may increase the efficacy of the intervention will be examined, including children?s gender, popularity, past peer victimization, empathy, moral disengagement, and self-efficacy for defending. This study will also examine whether the DRT- based intervention leads to decreases in aggression and victimization by increasing classroom- levels of defending. This study supports the mission of the NICHD by contributing to our understanding of the motivational processes underlying defending. The findings will have implications for the development of anti-bullying interventions and more broadly for understanding how to encourage important behavioral changes in childhood and adolescence."
"9335933","Abstract The role of the mucosal immune response in protecting against acute infectious illness versus promoting chronic inflammatory disease must be better defined to understand and treat these conditions. To address this issue, we are pursuing evidence that lung macrophages efficiently infiltrate the airway mucosal epithelium and adjacent parenchyma to control acute respiratory viral infection, but if unchecked could also contribute to chronic airway disease after the infection is cleared. In support of this hypothesis, we have learned that lung macrophages near the airway (in mucosal and adjacent parenchymal locations) express the myeloid receptor TREM-2 as distinct cell-surface and soluble forms, and that each form can stimulate anti-apoptotic signaling in macrophages to allow for macrophage survival. Thus, we showed that cell-surface TREM-2 is increased during viral infection by the action of dsRNA and prevents macrophage apoptosis during acute viral illness, whereas soluble TREM-2 (sTREM-2) is increased after clearance of infection by the actions of IL-13 and DAP12 and prevents macrophage apoptosis to further increase IL-13 production and chronic post-viral disease. The findings suggest that macrophages can be protective during the acute immune response but inflammatory during the chronic immune response to respiratory viral infection based on new actions of the TREM-2 signaling pathway. Preliminary studies of humans show that respiratory viral infection and IL-13 can also increase cell-surface and soluble TREM-2 levels in human macrophages. We now aim to further define the role of macrophage TREM-2 in acute and chronic mucosal immune responses to respiratory viral infection. Critical questions include: how cell-surface and soluble TREM-2 levels are regulated in lung macrophages, and how cell-surface and soluble forms of TREM-2 control anti-apoptotic pathways, especially in macrophage populations near the airway epithelium. We propose that TREM-2 (particularly as the cell-surface form) is an integral component of mucosal immunity whereas an exaggerated level of TREM-2 (particularly as the soluble form) provides a feed-forward mechanism to drive an excessive type 2 immune response. Thus, the cell-surface form of TREM-2 could protect against acute viral infection but the soluble form could promote chronic post-viral disease. We will especially compare the regulation and function of cell-surface to soluble TREM-2 to develop the hypothesis that down-regulating soluble TREM-2 level might even enhance cell-surface TREM-2 level and thereby improve immune function at mucosal barriers. Based on our preliminary studies, we next aim to: (1) define how TREM-2 is expressed, focusing on the appearance of TREM-2 at the cell surface and the cleavage of cell-surface TREM-2 to soluble TREM-2 in macrophages; and (2) define how cell-surface and soluble TREM-2 signal to inhibit apoptosis in macrophages, focusing on any differences between the two forms of TREM-2 in activating downstream signal transduction."

"9459151","Proposal: Identifying a network of miRNAs and genes that regulate breast tumor metastasis Abstract Metastasis is the major cause of death in breast cancer patients. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor initiation and metastasis are not clear. We have recently identified tumor initiation cells (TICs) from human breast tumors 1,2. TICs carry certain properties of stem cells, are more resistant to conventional cancer therapies, and are involved in tumor metastasis. How to effectively target TICs or metastasis initiating cells (MICs) thus becomes one of the most propelling questions. Endogenous single strand small RNAs of 20- 22 nucleotides in length, known as microRNAs (miRNAs, miRs), have emerged to be powerful regulators of tumor progression 3-15. In this project, we aim to characterize novel miRs that regulate human breast cancer initiation and metastasis and identify their target genes. Then in our future endeavors, we will examine miR regulation mechanisms at the transcriptional level and further translate our understanding to clinical applications, such as novel cancer biomarkers or therapeutics. Most previous metastasis models are limited in their ability to fully represent human tumors, due to genetic changes accumulated in culture for human cancer cell lines, genetic differences in mouse tumor models compared to human tumors, and bypassing the natural steps of metastasis via bloodstream inoculations. This project will take advantage of our recently established human-in-mouse breast cancer models, which are derived from clinical tumor specimens and develop spontaneous lung or lymph node metastases upon orthotopic transplantation into mouse mammary fat pads. To closely monitor breast tumor initiation and metastasis in vivo, we have also transduced primary cancer cells with optical reporters and improved the detection sensitivity to 10 cells in vivo via non-invasive bioluminescence imaging. MiRs are more stable and resistant to analysis protocols than mRNAs, thus serving as promising novel cancer biomarkers. Furthermore, they are endogenous small RNAs with little toxicity compared to compound drugs; therefore hold the promise to be developed as innovative cancer therapeutics. Our long-term goal is to combine our understanding of tumor initiation and metastasis with knowledge in multi- disciplinary technology (such as chemistry and bioengineering) to improve clinical medicine and reduce cancer mortality.

"9412348","Abstract Successful tuberculosis vaccine development is critically dependent on identifying host factors that protect against the development of active tuberculosis (TB). The immunologic components that prevent disease development are incompletely understood, especially during the early stages of infection. While cell-mediated immunity has been extensively studied, the role of antibodies (Abs) remains less explored. In recent years, various studies have provided increasing evidence for a role of Ab-mediated immunity against TB including compelling evidence for protective systemic Ab functions in humans with latent (LTBI) compared to active TB. However, little is known about the involvement and timing of Ab responses at the local level of M. tuberculosis (Mtb) infection but studies suggest that early events could impact the outcome of infection. Identifying potentially protective Ab profiles against specific immunogenic Mtb antigens would fill a gap in knowledge and could contribute to the better understanding of early immune responses in Mtb infection. Cynomolgus macaques infected with low-dose Mtb develop latent infection and TB in equal proportion. Unlike most other models, this model provides a unique opportunity to examine immunologic factors that could influence the outcomes of infection similar to those in humans. Based on our preliminary data with samples from Mtb infected macaques, our overall hypothesis is that Abs against certain Mtb antigens are associated with the lack of TB development in natural infection. We propose to evaluate a spectrum of humoral immune responses in Mtb infected nonhuman primates (NHPs) in an unbiased approach with the goal of identifying Ab profiles that are associated with controlled LTBI. We have banked serial samples of plasma and broncho-alveolar lavage fluid from animals with defined latent and active infection. With these samples, we will address the following Aims: 1. To investigate mucosal airway Ab responses elicited by airway Mtb infection; and 2. To identify systemic Ab patterns that are associated with lack of TB development. Identifying potentially protective Abs to specific immunogenic Mtb antigens would fill a gap in knowledge, and could inform vaccine development. Our proposed short term plan is to identify novel Ab targets that correlate with lack of TB development in natural infection (this current proposal). Our long term plan is to generate monoclonal Abs (mAbs) to a spectrum of potentially protective Mtb antigens, study their functions, and assess their protective efficacy in vivo. The proposed studies have a high likelihood of success given the expertise of the investigators, the promising preliminary data, the unique assays used, and the availability of stored well-characterized NHP samples."
"9376003","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This proposal outlines an early stage investigator grant (NIBIB Trailblazer R21) for the PI to develop optical technologies for real-time imaging of cerebral response to cardiac arrest (CA). CA affects over 550,000 people in the U.S., and 80-90% of survivors suffer severe neurological deficits due to altered cerebral hemodynamics.. There is a severe unmet clinical need for quantitative tools to monitor cerebral perfusion, metabolism, and neurovascular coupling during CA, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and post-CPR.  To meet this need, we will develop an optical imaging platform and validate it in a rat model of CA and CPR to generate new clinically-translational discoveries. This technology will be combined with quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) and biomarkers in our unique pre-clinical intensive care setting. Our long term goal is to understand spatiotemporal changes in brain hemodynamics related to neurological outcome, to develop interventions to help CA patients.  Our optical platform will provide real-time, co-registered multispectral spatial frequency domain imaging (SFDI) and laser speckle imaging (LSI) of critical neurovascular parameters: oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin, CBF, tissue scattering, and relative cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (rCMRO2). We will combine this with qEEG to monitor neurovascular coupling and subsequent neurological outcome parameters.  The specific aims of this proposal focus on developing and validating this optical platform to investigate hyperdynamic cerebral perturbations, predict neurological recovery, and allow for intervention in real-time.  Aim 1: Develop and validate a multimodal video-rate optical imaging platform for continuous monitoring of cerebral neurovascular response to CA and CPR. We will build video-rate LSI and SFDI instrumentation to measure pulsatile blood flow, absorption, and scattering in tissue. We will develop algorithms to co-register LSI and SFI during motion-prone periods, including CPR. We will validate the platform on tissue-simulating phantoms and an in vivo rat model to characterize dose responses to changes in cerebral hemodynamics and qEEG.  Aim 2: Identify and modulate optical imaging parameters from CA to <40 min post-CPR that are predictive of neurologic recovery and test therapeutic potential of our imaging platform. We will modulate CBF and rCMRO2 to improve neural activity, and conversely, we will use neuro-stimulation to induce changes in CBF and rCMRO2 during CA and after CPR.  This proposal will develop a video-rate optical platform that is uniquely capable of investigating neurovascular coupling during hyperdynamic periods of CA and CPR, with potential to improve post- CA survival. We plan to utilize these funds to develop a competitive R01 application for translation of our platform to the neurointensive care unit to ultimately improve neurological outcome after CA."
"9325997","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and the related antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) are predisposed to life-threatening thrombotic events. Neutrophils, and in particular neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), have recently been linked to both active SLE and thrombosis. The possibility that NETs might be an important trigger of thrombosis in autoimmune disease patients has not, however, been rigorously evaluated. This award will play a critical role in helping me achieve my long-term career goals, which include: (1) becoming an expert in SLE and APS pathogenesis, especially the interplay between innate immune responses and thrombosis, (2) establishing a career as an independent investigator at a leading medical research institution, and (3) mentoring and fostering the development of trainees. These objectives will be reached by incorporating both a strong mentorship environment and a formal instructional plan. The plan focuses on specific scientific and career development goals. Mentorship Environment: I am currently a Clinical Lecturer in the Division of Rheumatology at the University of Michigan. I will become a tenure-track Assistant Professor on January 1, 2014. With this promotion, my time will be protected for research with just one-half day of clinic per week. Further, as is detailed in the Letter of Institutional Suppor, substantial start-up funds will be provided to support my research activities. Over the past two years, I have received strong training from Dr. Mariana Kaplan as an immunologist. In this proposal, I am seeking support for a significantly new research endeavor, as I turn my attention to the pathologic thrombosis inherent to systemic autoimmune diseases such as SLE. Dr. David Pinsky, an expert in cardiovascular medicine and the interplay between inflammation and thrombosis, will be my primary research mentor going forward. Formal Instruction: My scientific goals include: (1) applying models of neutrophil activation and thrombosis to the rheumatic diseases, (2) working effectively and efficiently with patient samples, and (3) mechanistically studying platelet signaling and activation. Basic science coursework will be through several centers at the University of Michigan including the Center for Statistical Consultation and Research, the Flow Cytometry Core, and the Center for Live Cell Imaging. I also plan to regularly attend the intensive Symposium on Hemostasis, held biennially in Chapel Hill, NC. Equally important are my career development goals, which include: (1) improving written and oral communication skills, (2) developing IRB proposals for research on human subjects, and (3) enriching my mentoring skills. Specific instructional programs and courses will be utilized including the Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research, IRBMED, the Program for Education and Evaluation in Responsible Research and Scholarship, and the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program. Research: Globally, I plan to explore the hypothesis that exaggerated NET formation is an important mediator of pathologic thrombosis in SLE and APS patients. Aim 1 will study the role of antiphospholipid antibodies (the hallmark of APS, and also frequently found in SLE) in activating neutrophils to release NETs. Aim 2 will explore the extent to which SLE platelets interact with neutrophils to promote NET formation. Aim 3 will build on the human studies of Aims 1 and 2 by testing the importance of neutrophils and platelets in animal models of autoimmune-mediated thrombosis and vascular damage."
"9358206","Project Summary Providing medical students with meaningful research experiences during their training is an important piece in generating physicians who incorporate research into their careers. There is a strong need for research aware clinicians in rural areas in the Upper Midwest. Having a cadre that focuses its efforts in the area of pediatric medicine will also be important in addressing the health disparities seen in rural and American Indian populations. The ultimate goal of the DRPMS is to help meet the future needs of health-related research by contributing to the development of physicians who will be well- prepared to use evidence-based medicine in practice and contribute to translational research. The Northern Plains have a large number of health disparities among the children and adolescents. Thus there is a compelling need to support and promote the training of the physicians in training in developmental research. Faculty members at the Sanford School of Medicine are strong in research focused on development: prenatal development, postnatal development, diseases and issues of children and adolescents. The Developmental Research Program for Medical Students (DRPMS) proposed here will help provide medical students with exposure to research areas of development in order to kindle their interest in pursuing this as part of their careers. The Sanford School of Medicine has recently integrated its curriculum. As an extension of this, the school is in the process of developing a strategy to integrate research into the educational experience of all medical students as a required educational activity. While the school of medicine has always had ad hoc programs for medical students to participate in research, the program proposed in this application will provide a structured program that involves research but includes an additional seminars series on career development, including how to incorporate scholarship, as well as responsible conduct of research. The Program Directors will be assisted in the management of the program by an Executive Committee and an Internal Advisory Committee. Six students per year will be accepted into the DRPMS. There will be specific strategies employed to increase the number of trainees from diverse and disadvantaged backgrounds. Selection of the trainees will be done by the Executive Committee. The research progress will be followed by the mentor(s) and the PDs. After completion of the program trainees will be invited back to become peer mentors or to continue on with research outside of the program. Intermediate and longitudinal follow- up of the trainees will be performed as part of the program's evaluation."
"9537207","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While research progress pertaining to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been extraordinary in some areas, many critical gaps in knowledge remain, particularly with respect to the development of treatments that address primary neurobiological abnormalities in affected individuals. For example, almost all children with fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common known genetic cause of ASD, exhibit symptoms of severe social anxiety, manifested by high levels of social gaze avoidance and other social escape behaviors during interactions with others. To date, however, behavioral treatments designed to ameliorate these intransigent and socially stigmatizing behaviors have not been evaluated. We propose to address this critical knowledge gap by evaluating a 3-day treatment probe targeted to improving social gaze behavior in children with FXS using the principles of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA). Importantly, we propose to examine the effects of this treatment probe on brain and behavior.  Two groups of subjects will be recruited in the study: 1) Boys with FXS aged 10 to 15 years (N = 40), and 2) age- and symptom-matched children who do not have FXS (N=40). Participants will travel to Stanford for a 5-day evaluation. Participants in each group will be randomized to receive either Social Gaze Training conducted in 2 x 1hr sessions per day on Days 2, 3 and 4 (total training time = 6 hours) or No-Training which will consist of equivalent amounts of therapist time and reinforcement over the same time period, but with no training of social gaze behavior. We will measure change in social and neurobiological functioning by conducting standardized behavioral and neuroimaging assessments on Day 1 and Day 5. For the behavioral assessment, appropriate social behavior will be measured during a standardized social challenge assessment conducted with an eye-tracker. For the neurobiological assessment, salience network activation will be measured using resting-state fMRI. To assess the longer-term effects of social gaze training in terms of durabilit and generalizability, we have included a 4-week follow-up assessment in which standardized questionnaires of everyday social functioning will be administered.  The results of this study promises to provide important information regarding both behavioral effects and brain-behavior associations following skills training in FXS that will form the foundation of future studies of social processing in FXS and ASD. This study will therefore have a significant impact on intervention designs and treatments for children with FXS and other disorders associated with ASD symptomatology, both now and in the future."
"9422217","ABSTRACT Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood, accounting for significant morbidity and reduced quality of life. Like many other chronic diseases, asthma is thought to result from a complex interplay between genes and environment. Although the advent of genome wide scans has provided us with rich datasets of polymorphisms in thousands of genes, utilization of this overwhelming amount of data for gene by environment interaction studies remains challenging. Genome wide expression (mRNA) signals generated in response to exposures of interest can help us focus genome wide data, so that only polymorphisms in relevant gene- activation pathways are tested in gene by environment interaction models. One important environmental factor, known to influence both asthma incidence and asthma severity, is exposure to bacteria and mold in the environment. Microbial components called PAMPs (pathogen associated molecular patterns) can modulate the immune system in ways that either decrease susceptibility to asthma or, alternatively, worsen airway inflammation and wheeze. This proposal outlines an integrative genomics strategy for studying how genetic polymorphisms alter the effects of microbial exposures on asthma phenotypes in five cohorts. First, we will analyze genome wide expression (mRNA) profiles of PAMP-stimulated immune cells to identify gene targets for interaction with environmental microbes. Next, we will determine if polymorphisms in these genes, either individually or as SNP sets in functionally related genes, modify the effects of environmental bacteria and fungi on asthma incidence and severity. Finally, we will examine how epigenetic modifications (DNA methylation) of PAMP signaling genes alter gene expression in response to microbial stimuli."
"9524961","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the US, there are 720,000 annual incidences of heart attack, out of which 515,000 are first time heart attacks. Risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) are thought to be well-defined, but they do not identify all at-risk individuals. Therefore, there is a need to detect other factors that provide more near-term risk assessment for CVD. The early manifestations of risk factors found in the retina can detect a threat of an impending cardiovascular event, and monitoring these precursors provides an early insight into risk of CVD. For this reason, we have developed the Comprehensive Assessment of Retinal Vasculature (CARV), a fully automated screening device for the detection of retinal abnormalities and assessment of associated CVD risk. In Phase I, the research team at Vision Quest Biomedical demonstrated the feasibility of the CARV second reader system to provide objective measurements and detect potential vascular abnormalities to assist a retinal reader, resulting in increased disease detection at a reduced reading time. In Phase II, the second reader system will evolve into a fully automatic first reader system that quantifies the risk of CVD based on retinal abnormalities. We will accomplish this through two specific aims. In the first aim, we will add additional methods for detecting retinal abnormalities and lesions. We will then develop a classifier to automatically assign a CVD risk of low, moderate, or severe to each case CARV processes. In the second aim, we will combine these software tools to produce a near real-time system to automatically detect signs of hypertensive retinopathy and assign a CVD risk grade based on the results. At the end of Phase II, we will demonstrate a validated CARV first reader and second reader system. CARV second reader will likely be given a Class I device by the FDA, and we expect clearance within a year. The intended use will be that of an aid to readers in a telemedicine environment. With CARV second reader serving as a predicate device, the CARV first reader system can be submitted as a 510k device to the FDA, following the successful completion of a clinical trial."
"9367817","Project Abstract: The development of new methods for the efficient and stereoselective preparation of amine-containing chemical building blocks is a compelling objective in organic synthesis as a large number of biologically active compounds contain an amino group bound to a stereogenic carbon. The chemical functionality that may flank the amine in these compounds is vast, including a number of commonly-encountered motifs, such as amino alcohols and diamines; additionally, the amine-bearing stereogenic center may be tri- or tetrasubstituted. Despite their frequency in targets of biological importance, methods for the stereoselective synthesis of 1,3- diamines, 1,3-amino alcohols, and amino-containing tetrasubstituted stereogenic centers are sparse, with the mode of their generation often labor intensive and/or circuitous. Several scaffolds within these frameworks have only rarely been produced. The long-term goal of this research program is to design and develop novel stereoselective C?C bond-forming methods for preparing difficult-to-access but highly sought-after chiral amines. Our strategy employs a polarity reversal of an imine (umpolung): rather than act as an N-substituted carbon electrophile, we transform the reagent to an N-substituted carbon nucleophile?a 2-azaallyl anion? that may be combined stereoselectively with a number of electrophilic partners to furnish alpha-substituted chiral amines. In these investigations, we will focus on C?C bond formations with 2-azaallyl anions for: 1) the stereoselective synthesis of challenging 1,3-diamine and amino alcohol functionality, 2) the enantioselective preparation of homoallylic amines with N-containing tetrasubstituted stereogenic centers, and 3) stereoselective three component coupling reactions with a silyl-substituted 2-azaallyl anion as a double alpha- amino anion equivalent. The new methods developed under the aegis of this project provide innovative solutions to long-standing challenges in the preparation of chiral amines that will permit streamlined synthesis of several biologically important complex molecules. The new chemical space that will be garnered might enable exploration of novel medicinal leads that may lead to active pharmaceutical ingredients to improve human health."
"9242751","PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this competing renewal application is to support the core infrastructure and continued follow-up of the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS), a cancer epidemiology cohort (CEC) established in 1986 and including 51,529 male health professionals age 40 to 75 years at baseline. This cohort is unique in its focus on men's health and follow-up of almost three decades, a time frame that is essential to realistically understand the relation between modifiable factors and cancer risk. Over this period of time, data has been regularly updated on diet, activity, smoking, weight, medications, and other potentially modifiable determinants of cancer risk. An extensive biorepository has been established that includes DNA from most participants, toenails, red cells, and plasma. Tumor tissue has been obtained from a high percentage of incident prostate and colorectal cancers; a recent supplement is supporting collection of tissue for less common tumors and noncancerous prostate tissue. Cohort follow-up has been consistently 90% or higher at each two-year cycle and mortality follow-up is virtually complete. Epidemiological studies from the HPFS, alone and through participation in consortia, have helped elucidate risk factors for cancer incidence and determinants of cancer survival in men. With cohort members now in an age of high cancer incidence, the HPFS is in a highly productive phase. During the current funding cycle, 325 papers have been published that utilize data and/or biological samples from HPFS; 200 of these have specifically examined cancer or cancer precursor outcomes. To date, 13,346 participants have been diagnosed with cancer and 3,571 cancer deaths have occurred; 5,791 men in HPFS are currently living with a cancer diagnosis. In the next funding cycle, we propose the following aims. 1-) To continue active follow-up for cancer incidence and mortality and to update exposure data pre and post-diagnosis of cancer. 2-) To update the food composition database that supports dietary assessment in HPFS and the Nurses' Health Study I and II cohorts. 3-) To leverage a recently completed validation study of physical activity and collaborate with colleagues in two multiethnic cohorts of men to calibrate physical activity questions. 4-) To make a first time linkage to Medicare Claims data. 5-) To maintain the HPFS cancer tissue biorepository, and expand collections of prostate and colon, and undertake a new collection of lung cancer in nonsmokers. 6-) To maintain the other biorepositories including plasma, red blood cells, germline DNA, and toenail samples. 7-) To undertake a new post-diagnostic blood collection among men with prostate cancer. 8-) To maintain and augment the statistical infrastructure and data management of the cohort. 9-) To facilitate resource sharing and collaborations with other CECs and outside investigators. With additional cohort follow- up, particularly after cancer diagnosis, the HPFS remains ideally positioned to make innovative contributions to our overall goal of reducing the burden of cancer by identifying primary and secondary prevention strategies."
"9257600","Overall - Project Summary/Abstract: The contamination of water and aquifer sediments with arsenic (As) is associated with major public health and environmental mitigation issues in the United States. At present, 823 of 1739 U.S. Superfund sites list As as a major contaminant; in addition millions of U.S. residents are unduly exposed due to naturally occurring As in their household well water. This proposal includes two biomedical and two geoscience projects that seek to address critically important issues that collectively aim to reduce As exposure and toxicity in exposed human populations in the U.S. and in Bangladesh, where much information can be learned that will benefit residents of the U.S. and elsewhere. The proposal builds on the strengths of our existing longitudinal cohort study of 35,000 adults in Bangladesh by examining dose-response relationships between As exposure (in the low-mid range) from contaminated food and water with incident cases (and sub-types) of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and non-malignant lung disease, as well as diabetes mellitus (DM). In addition, we will combine and meta-analyze data from Bangladesh, Taiwan, China (Inner Mongolia) and the U.S. (AZ, CO, ND, OK, SD) to refine the dose-response relationships between As exposure and CVD. We build off our previous observations that: a) As exposure is associated with deficits in child intelligence; and b) that folate, a B vitamin, facilitates As metabolism and elimination in adults. We propose to conduct a randomized clinical trial in 8-10 year old children in Bangladesh to test the hypothesis that folate+B12 supplementation can: a) lower blood As; and b) improve cognitive abilities in children.  Building on our previous geoscience research which indicates that in situ magnetite formation forms a diffuse barrier capable of long-term As retention, we propose to conduct laboratory and field research to optimize and implement this new approach at a U.S. Geological Survey research site on Cape Cod, MA and a Superfund site in Raleigh, NC. In Bangladesh, we will quantify the geographic and socio-political barriers to reducing As exposure by analyzing the vast data sets accumulated in our main study area and we will conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing ways to overcome some of them. In parallel, we will continue to examine the potential vulnerability to human perturbations of shallow and deep aquifers that are low in As. These low As aquifers are crucial for reducing exposure to our study population and the country at large.  In the U.S., we will build on our proven success of partnering with state and local governments to reduce As exposure in communities that rely on As-contaminated household wells in ME, NJ and MN. We will also continue to facilitate effective communication among our SRP scientists, stakeholders and government partners via five specific strategies. Finally, we will continue to train the next generation of scientists with disciplinary and inter-disciplinary skills that will enable them to improve the health of those who reside in environments that might expose them to As and other contaminants in soil, water and food. "
"9333272","Project 2 Abstract  Improving the delivery of immunotherapeutics or immunomodulatory molecules is key to  improving cancer vaccines. Nanoparticles (NPs) represent an ideal vehicle for in vivo delivery of  cancer immunotherapy or cancer vaccines. We pioneered a nanoparticle molding technology,  PRINT® (Particle Replication in Non-wetting Templates), that allows unprecedented control and  specification of the physical/chemical properties of NPs. PRINT can produce particles with  varied parameters such as shape, size, porosity, and chemical composition and therefore  represents an ideal platform to test such parameters to achieve optimized anti-tumor  vaccination and immunity. Additionally, we and others have shown the potency of small  molecules comprised of PAMPs (Pathogen-associated Molecular Patterns) which engage the  pathogen-recognition receptors (PRRs), elicit adjuvant activity, and activate desirable anti-  cancer immunity. The use of PRINT to deliver these adjuvants is ideal in that PRINT  nanoparticles are taken up by antigen presenting cells, which when activated can elicit strong  specific T cell response. Another key finding is that successful therapeutic cancer vaccines  must be able to induce a robust response to circumvent the highly immunosuppressive nature of  the tumor microenvironment. The most promising results have been obtained by combining  potent cancer vaccines that elicit strong anti-tumor immunity with immune modulating agents  that help to break immunological tolerance. Nanotechnology represents a promising system to  deliver small molecules to the tumor site to more efficiently inhibit immune-tolerance inducing  pathways. The goal of this proposal is to address these three key issues."

The objective ofthe Cancer Control and Survivorship Program, which is comprised of 38 faculty members from 13 departments and 2 schools is to facilitate and focus research on secondary cancer control and survivorship within the Cancer Center. Between August 2007 and July 2012, there were 545 cancer-relevant publications from the program members, with 26.6% representing intra-programmatic and 31.4% representing inter-programmatic collaborations. A total of 7,138 participants were enrolled in program studies with 2,802 enrolled on intervention studies and 4,336 enrolled on observational or correlative studies. Total cancer relevant funding for the Program is $14,818,344, with 70% coming from peer reviewed funding. Peer reviewed funding is $10,367,715 (total) and $7,612,441 (direct), with $1,819,740 (23.9%) from NCI and $5,792,702 from other peer reviewed sources. Areas of research include: measurement science, determinants of optimal survivorship including basic mechanisms, psychosocial interventions and educational programs, and symptom palliation. The contribution of program efforts in improving quality of life, state ofthe art assessment of patient reported outcomes and palliation of cancer-related physical and psychosocial symptom burden via psychosocial interventions, coupled with community based activities, support the significance of this work. The Program is highly innovative as it involves multiple projects implementing cutting edge technology. The Program actively seeks to improve cancer control and survivorship by developing and implementing methodologically sound, clinically relevant and highly innovative research initiatives that are clinically effective and translational, aimed to reduce the burden of cancer across multiple communities. Members' interests and capabilities span many disciplines. Their integrated focus upon cancer control and survivorship promotes an environment of intra- and inter-program collaboration and productivity."
"9260371","ADMINISTRATIVE CORE SUMMARY The UNM Metal Exposure Toxicity Assessment on Tribal Lands in the Southwest (METALS) Superfund Research Program (SRP) and Training Center will focus on risk reduction for Native Americans exposed to hazardous mixtures of metals from abandoned uranium mines. The specific theme of the UNM METALS center is elucidation of how exposures to metal mixtures from uranium mining wastes result in DNA damage and immune dysregulation. The Center has a particular focus on how these exposure:outcome relationships are manifested in Tribal populations throughout the West who carry much of the burden of these exposures with only minimal understanding of their impacts. The biomedical research proposed in UNM METALS focuses on major uncertainties in these outcomes, while environmental projects seek to complement this research by improving understanding of the mineralogic and biogeochemical environment that impacts mobility, toxicity and remediation, and by testing novel metals immobilization strategies that may reduce risks long term. Recognizing that complete remediation of these sites under CERCLA remains decades away, METALS will use multi-directional community engagement and research translation cores to develop and implement trans- generational approaches to risk communication and risk avoidance that integrate indigenous learning models and Western science. The METALS Center will integrate training of junior faculty and graduate students with multi-directional training of community members and research staff so that local knowledge of mining impacts and health problems inform air and water monitoring needed to support the environmental and biomedical research projects. The Administrative Core will provide the coordination and oversight to ensure overall operational and scientific integration of the team, to ensure scientific integrity to promote linkage among the projects both scientifically and professionally, to facilitate integration of goals with community needs, and to enable effective translation of findings to the communities impacted through the following four Specific Aims: In Specific Aim 1 we will coordinate communication among project and core leaders to ensure scientific progress, to discuss and address issues and to disseminate relevant information and significant findings. In Specific Aim 2 we will ensure effective research translation and communication with community members and other stakeholders. In Specific Aim 3 we will administer pilot research funding opportunities for members of the UNM METALS team. Lastly, in Specific Aim 4 we will provide financial oversight, facilitate resource support and ensure regulatory compliance related to research and community activities associated with the Center. The Administrative Core will also ensure that all compliance requirements of sponsors, research institutions and community partners are met. The Core will also work to expand transdisciplinary collaborations with the UNM Cancer Center to advance our common interests and those of our communities on the role of these metals exposures in cancer etiology."
"9256305","Abstract Through this project we propose to develop a therapeutic antibody against Staphylococcus aureus (S.a.) that simultaneously targets multiple secreted S.a. toxins, as well as a cell-surface target, in a molecule that also contains a functional human IgG1 Fc domain. S. aureus infections are very common and their treatment is becoming more complex due to broadening antibiotic resistance. Inhibrx has developed a platform where multiple camelid heavy chain only variable domains (VHHs) are joined end to end, together with an Fc effector domain, in any order to produce multi-valent, multi-specific molecules targeting multiple epitopes on a single target or multiple targets. We have already developed a tetravalent, bispecific heavy chain only antibody, with specificity against five S.a. toxins. We propose to combine this antibody with a bacterial surface binding component to create a multi-specific anti-?MRSA antibody. We hypothesize that toxin blocking functionality will protect immune cells recruited to the site of infection, while cell binding capability will enable opsonization of S.a., followed by its clearance.? We have targeted two highly conserved S.a. cell surface proteins for development of antibodies: Protein A and ?EFB, and identified a number of candidate high affinity antibodies against either of these targets. Importantly, as Protein A binds the Fc region of antibodies in a non-immune fashion, preventing efficient opsonization of the bacterium, Inhibrx has integrated a proprietary Fc domain that does not bind Protein A into our anti-Protein A targeting antibodies, producing antibodies that avoid non- immune Protein A binding. In the present application we propose to select bacterial binding antibodies from among the above candidates, and use them to create hexavalent, multi-specific antibodies that incorporate toxin blocking VHHs targeting five S.a. toxins, together with cell surface-binding VHHs, and a Protein A resistant Fc domain, all in one antibody therapeutic. As the component antibodies from which the VHHs for our candidate therapeutic are taken are camelid in origin, we propose in Specific Aim #1 to utilize?Inhibrx?s?humanization?strategy to make the antibody compatible with human administration. In Specific Aim #2 our lead cell targeting antibodies will be compared for binding in the presence of their natural substrates and to whole bacteria in order to select lead antibodies for one or both targets for development of multi-specific antibody. Finally, in Specific Aim #3, the humanized lead toxin blocking antibodies and the humanized EFB- and Protein A-binding antibodies selected in Specific Aim #2, will be combined in various formats using the Inhibrx platform. A lead therapeutic antibody will be chosen based on toxin blocking and bacterial binding capabilities. Multi-specific antibodies will then be tested in in vitro functional studies as well as in vivo (murine) models of S.a. infection. At the conclusion of Phase I, we will be ready to apply for Phase II funding to perform PK and IND enabling studies in NHPs, after which point Inhibrx will have demonstrated pre-clinical efficacy of an unparalleled anti-MRSA therapeutic."
"9381252","PROJECT SUMMARY The foundational mechanism of translation initiation was discovered in E. coli over 40 years ago. Despite the textbook perception that this mechanism is ubiquitous among all bacteria, E. coli is actually highly adapted to utilize Shine-Dalgarno sequences for translation initiation. Examination of genomic data across species reveals that fewer than half of all bacterial messages have Shine-Dalgarno sequences to position ribosomes at the initiation codon. Indeed, many pathogenic bacteria lack Shine-Dalgarno sites in most messages and the molecular mechanisms of start codon selection are largely unknown in these species. C. crescentus is currently the best model system to study non-Shine-Dalgarno translation initiation as it has a rapid doubling time, a broad array of genetic tools, and a low fraction of genes initiated at Shine-Dalgarno sites (23.5%), including 375 leaderless mRNAs containing a 5? AUG. By combining in vitro translation assays and in vivo ribosome profiling experiments we seek to define the important aspects of non-Shine-Dalgarno initiation in this organism. We believe that many of the characteristics of C. crescentus translation initiation will be shared with the translation initiation pathways of pathogenic organisms, potentially leading to the identification of new antibiotic targets."
"9321938","Project 1: Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is an uncommon neoplasm affecting women that is associated with cystic lung destruction and progressive respiratory failure. Mutations in tuberous sclerosis genes result in activation of mTOR signaling, loss of homeostatic growth control, and inappropriate lymphangiogenic growth factor expression. From an unknown source, metastasis of LAM cells to the lung and destructive lung remodeling result in recurrent pneumothoraces, chylous-effusions and lung function impairment. The Multicenter International LAM Efficacy of Sirolimus (MILES) Trial demonstrated that mTOR inhibition with sirolimus was an effective therapy which stabilized decline in FEV1. However, lung function decline resumed when the drug was held at the one year point in MILES, suggesting that the therapy is suppressive rather than remission-inducing, and may need to be lifelong. We therefore need to know whether long-term therapy with sirolimus is safe and effective. To accomplish this goal, we will enroll 75 LAM patients on sirolimus for clinical reasons in a longitudinal observational study, and following lung function tests, biomarker and adverse events over periods of up to 4 years. Another observation from MILES was that the patients who enrolled had surprisingly severe lung function impairment, including (on average) an FEV1 and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide of ~50% of predicted, and a need for supplemental oxygen in the majority of patients. It is unclear, therefore, if the results of MILES can be generalized to patients with early disease. In the face of this uncertainty, and because of fear of toxicities, patients and their physicians generally opt to defer therapy until lung function is abnormal; a stage at which extensive lung damage has already occurred. To determine if prophylactic treatment of early, often asymptomatic patients can arrest lung function decline, we will screen a population of premenopausal patients with LAM and normal lung function (postbronchodilator FEV1 of >70% predicted) for patients who are declining at a rate of 3 fold normal (-90cc/yr) or greater, or 2 fold normal (-60cc/yr) or greater in combination with an elevated VEGF-D (which predicts rapid disease progression). This rapid declining cohort will then be placed on low dose sirolimus therapy and followed every three months with pulmonary function tests, biomarker studies and safety monitoring for two years. Collectively, these two trials will help us to refine the approach to treatment of patients with LAM, and determine if low dose long term suppressive therapy with sirolimus can prevent progression to later stages."

In summary, ICNN, in its initial award period, laid the foundation for a long-term, self- sustained entity supporting genomics neuroscience research at UCLA and has facilitated a number of projects and training grants. With an expanded faculty and a solid computational infrastructure put in place in the previous funding cycle, ICNN proposes in the renewal to continue to support NINDS grants (15 from 9 named users), to continue to develop innovative genetics and genomics approaches, and to continue to foster neurogenetics and neurogenomics for the neuroscience community at UCLA."
"9386401","Abstract  A poorly evolved area of infectious disease research includes fully understanding the life cycle of a pathogen within different natural environments. Tick-borne relapsing fever (RF) spirochetes are one such pathogen that have adapted to colonize ticks and lice. The Ornithdoros tick vector is long lived (10 ? 20 years) and maintain the pathogens throughout their life history, with populations of spirochetes colonizing the midgut and salivary glands. These ticks are rapid feeders, completing the blood meal within 5 ? 60 minutes of attachment. Thus, the population of spirochetes in the salivary gland enters the mammalian host to continue the pathogen's life cycle. Since there is insufficient time for midgut population to reach the salivary glands during the short bloodmeal, the role of this population in the pathogens life cycle is unclear. Additionally, the genetic constituents expressed by spirochetes in the midgut and salivary glands are virtually unknown. With the longevity of the tick vector and their ability to continuously transmit RF spirochetes over their life time, one aspect of pathogenesis relevant to public health is understanding pathogen replication in the vector and identifying molecular events that RF spirochete utilize for vector colonization and transmission.  By developing the Borrelia turicatae ? Ornithodoros turicata model we can now define the pathogen's life cycle and identify genetic targets that are likely essential in the transmission cycle. This study will test the hypothesis that B. turicatae colonizing the midgut of infected ticks replicate following a bloodmeal and replenishes the salivary glands, and there are specific gene subsets expressed by the bacteria in each tissue. The following two Specific Aims are proposed: Aim 1: Define the life cycle of B. turicatae in the tick by assessing spirochete replication in the midgut before and at time points after the bloodmeal. These results will indicate whether RF spirochetes multiply in the tick, and implicate the midgut as the site of replication. Aim 2: Delineate expression patterns of genes localized on the B. turicatae 150 kb linear megaplasmid (lp150) in the tick midgut and salivary glands. Previous studies suggest that lp150 is likely essential in the life cycle of RF spirochetes, and this plasmid's genes will be assessed to determine their expression in the tick midgut and salivary glands.  Determining the importance of RF spirochete replication in the tick, and identifying genes expressed by the pathogens in the midgut and salivary glands will guide strategies to disrupt the bacteria's life cycle. The results will focus future research efforts to neutralize midgut population from replicating, and prevent the salivary gland population from establishing mammalian infection. These findings will be broadly applicable to Old and New World pathogens, and address NIAID's mission to better understand and prevent disease."
"9321926","Chronic inflammation is a characteristic, and possibly a cause, of the retinal damage associated with age related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of blindness among the elderly. Inflammation may be a consequence of age related oxidative stress or accumulation of toxins within the RPE and retina. This is a project to develop gene therapy for AMD by preventing inflammatory processes signaled by potent cytokines such as IL-1?. It is our hypothesis that, by reducing inflammation associated with these signaling molecules, we can halt the progression of AMD in patients diagnosed with early stage disease. There are two forms of the advanced disease, wet (exudative) AMD and geographic atrophy, both of which lead to loss of central vision. While there are effective treatments for wet AMD, there is no treatment for geographic atrophy, which leads to death of the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptor cells in the macula. Furthermore, atrophic processes may persist in wet AMD, even when choroidal neovascularization is under control. This project is a collaboration between two groups that have generated distinct mouse models for geographic atrophy. One of the models increases oxidative stress in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) by deleting the gene for a protective enzyme, manganese superoxide dismutase. The second model deletes the gene for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), causing ocular dysregulation of several pathways relevant to AMD including cholesterol homeostasis and clearance of oxidative stress-inducing toxins such as those found in cigarette smoke. Both models result in key features of dry AMD including accumulation of basal deposits in the RPE, damage to Bruch's membrane, RPE atrophy and dysfunction and death of photoreceptors. We propose to develop gene therapy in these models using adeno-associated virus (AAV) which has been demonstrated to be safe for gene transfer to the retina. Importantly, this virus does not provoke a severe inflammatory response. Our approach to therapy in the two models is to deliver genes for secreted, cell penetrating proteins that increase protection from oxidative stress or that reduce the production of inflammatory cytokines by stimulating synthesis of anti-oxidant enzymes or blocking the activity of the NLRP3 inflammasome and preventing the activation of caspase-1. We will validate that delivery of the secreted anti- inflammatory proteins to the vitreous produces peptides that permeate the retina and RPE. In the final component of the project, we will use cell-type specific viral vectors that produce non-secreted peptides in order to identify the cells that are major producers of inflammatory cytokines in our mouse models. Our goal is to develop gene therapy vectors that could be tested in patients, and we believe that one-time delivery of a therapeutic vector to the vitreous will be translatable to human gene therapy."
"9332381","A promising strategy for reducing the public health burden of smoking-related disease, currently under consideration by the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products, is to reduce the addictiveness of tobacco by reducing the nicotine content of cigarettes to below a level that will sustain addiction. There are, however, key unanswered questions that must be addressed in order to understand the impact of such a policy on our current smoking population, who increasingly use both e-cigarettes and conventional cigarettes. What is the nicotine abuse liability threshold for tobacco cigarettes in a context where smokers use nicotine-containing e- cigarettes? What are the minimal doses of nicotine that can produce discriminable rewarding effects and engender compulsive use? Will a nicotine abuse liability threshold applicable to long-time, heavy smokers also apply to younger, lighter smokers who are more sensitive to nicotine? The proposed research will address these issues by randomizing 320 smokers (both heavy, long-time smokers and lighter, younger smokers) to switch from their usual brands of cigarettes to research cigarettes with similar tar yields but five different nicotine contents. All participants will have access to concurrent use of e-cigarettes during the 12-week exposure period. We will assess the effects of cigarette nicotine content on measures of abuse liability, including daily cigarette consumption, smoking reward and measures of dependence, such as nicotine withdrawal symptoms. In laboratory sessions, we will measure nicotine thresholds for detecting and recognizing the addictive, rewarding effects of smoking. This study is designed to help the FDA identify a target nicotine threshold that will not attract young people to smoking or induce relapse in former smokers. Additionally, we will determine the level of cigarette nicotine reduction that will be tolerated without inducing dissatisfaction in smokers, information that is relevant to the FDA for designing a stepwise nicotine reduction policy that can be implemented without widespread objections. The knowledge gained from this project will greatly increase our knowledge of nicotine addiction and will help frame an FDA policy relating to the regulation of the nicotine content of tobacco. Ultimately, a well-designed nicotine reduction policy has the potential to greatly reduce the enormous toll of death and disease caused by cigarette smoking."
"9395215","Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood, with an economic burden that exceeds that of tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS combined. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that the origins of disease occur during pre-school years even when chronic symptoms appear in early adulthood. Moreover, several risk factors for childhood asthma suggest that the disease may have its beginnings already in utero, and the maternal milieu during pregnancy may contribute to disease risk. These data suggest that the trajectory to childhood asthma and related outcomes (e.g., allergic sensitization, wheeze) may begin prenatally, when maternal environmental exposures calibrate set points for responses to post-natal environmental cues.  Our preliminary data (mostly collected in our birth cohort, the Infant Immune Study: IIS) suggest that mechanisms rooted in the environmental microbiome, the maternal immune milieu, the child's immune epigenome at birth and early-life microbiota play a prominent role in this trajectory: a) microbial community structure in house dust is associated with asthma-related outcomes; b) the maternal prenatal immune milieu (expressed as the ratio between the amounts of IFN? and IL13 produced by mitogen-stimulated maternal PBMC isolated during the third trimester of pregnancy) influences asthma risk in the child; c) DNA methylation in cord blood immune cells from IIS neonates is associated with the maternal prenatal immune milieu (IFN?:IL13 ratio) to which the child was exposed in utero; d) the neonatal methylome differs in children who do and do not become asthmatic by age 9, and SMAD3 hypermethylation predicts asthma selectively in children born to asthmatic mothers; e) neonatal microbiome perturbation is associated with significantly different relative risk of allergy at age 2 and asthma at age 4.  The nature and chronology of these events lead us to hypothesize that the pregnant mother's immune profile, influenced by environmental exposures, modifies the child's epigenome in utero, postnatal airway microbiome development, and the trajectory to allergy and asthma during childhood. To test this hypothesis, we will leverage abundant existing information and well-characterized, banked samples from the IIS population. We propose to characterize the child's immune methylome at birth and its relationships with the prenatal maternal immune milieu (IFN?:IL13 ratio), respiratory microbiota development, and asthma and allergic disease outcomes from birth to age 9 yrs (Specific Aim 1); and to characterize environmental (house dust) microbial exposures and post-natal (<1 year old) respiratory microbiota and to assess their relationship with maternal prenatal immune profile, neonatal epigenome, and child's risk for asthma, allergy and related outcomes from birth to age 9 yrs (Specific Aim 2). To our knowledge, this is the first time that a single study examines all of these characteristics and their mutual relations in the context of childhood asthma and allergy. This proposal aims to fill this gap in knowledge to address the role of the hypothesized causal pathway in the development of childhood disease."
"9296774","Project Summary Human implantation, like that of other species with hemochorial placentation, is highly invasive and results in an intermingling of maternal and fetal cells that persists for the duration of pregnancy. This conjoining of the two compartments is essential for establishing optimal communication, laying the foundation for healthy pregnancies and long-term health of both mothers and their children. The maternal-fetal interface traditionally has been defined as the sites of cellular contact between placental trophoblast and maternal endometrium and blood, expanding with advancing gestation. A newer view is that this interface is even more expansive than previously realized, on account that great quantities of extravesicular material shed from the placenta into the maternal blood. The long-term goal of this application is to elucidate the functions of placental extracellular vesicles in pregnancy. Intercellular communication mediated by extracellular vesicles represents an evolutionarily conserved fundamental mechanism of communication, yet one we know little about. Recent research has informed us on the some of the probable functions of extracellular vesicles in pregnancy. In vitro studies suggest cellular targets of placental vesicles include maternal endothelial and immune cells, and that functions include vascular and immunological adaptation. However, major gaps remain in our understanding of extracellular vesicles, in part because there is a paucity of models available to study placental extracellular vesicles. In this proposal, we close some of these gaps by use of a new in vivo model in we can accomplish the major goals of this application: to distinguish and quantify maternal and placental extracellular vesicles; to identify in vivo maternal cellular targets of placental vesicles; and to observe vesicle-mediated transfer of functional RNA from the placenta to maternal cells. These studies will transform our understanding of placental extracellular vesicles, providing the first evidence of what has so far been phenomenological. The results will inform our development of use of placental vesicles as diagnostic and even therapeutic tools in pregnancy."
"9400986","Tumor heterogeneity has been known to contribute to diverse patient outcomes in response to targeted therapies. It has primarily been studied in the context of genetic mutations that are either pre-existing or acquired in response to drug treatment. However, we have discovered signs of phenotypic diversification in normal conditions over time, which we think is driven by non- genetic processes. In order to study this diversification, we have used complimentary concepts from ecological theory known as bet-hedging and phenotypic plasticity. Briefly, we think cancer cell populations diversify their ?bets? in normal conditions in order to increase chances of survival to any number of environmental changes. Underlying this theory, phenotypic plasticity suggests cells move around in a landscape of cell states, defined by molecular characteristics. These processes have been implicated in a variety of biological processes, including bacterial survival, stem cell differentiation, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions. Preliminary data in the laboratory suggests complex drug-response dynamics in BRAF-mutant melanoma cell lines, likely resulting from non-genetic heterogeneity. Single-cell derived ?clones? of the BRAF-mutant melanoma cell line SKMel5 have been generated and developed into cell sublines, which have shown differential phenotypes to drug treatment. In studying one of these sublines' response to BRAF inhibition, we have observed phenotypic diversification over time. Using a mathematical model that assumes phenotypic plasticity between non-genetically defined states, we have been able to form a theoretical basis for this experimental observation. In this proposal, we attempt to discern the existence of these states, identify molecular determinants, and monitor dynamic phenotypic diversification in real time."
"9306230","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cognitive functions such as learning and memory are of fundamental biological importance and diseases that affect these functions are among the most challenging biomedical problems of our time. We recently obtained evidence indicating that elevating levels of the pleotropic protein klotho enhances cognitive functions in mice and humans and can prevent synaptic and cognitive impairments in a transgenic mouse model simulating key aspects of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Klotho is a class I transmembrane protein whose ectodomain is released by proteolytic cleavage. In the periphery, it is produced predominantly by the kidney. Within the central nervous system (CNS), it is produced predominantly by the choroid plexus, with lower levels of expression seen in specific neuronal populations, particularly in the hippocampus. While diverse lines of evidence suggest that klotho delays aging and aging-related diseases, the functions it fulfills in the CNS and the roles it migh play in neurological disease are largely unknown. In our preliminary studies, increasing klotho production throughout the body of transgenic mice enhanced learning and memory not only in middle-aged and old mice, but also in young mice. Moreover, heterozygous human carriers of a KLOTHO variant (KL-VS) had elevated levels of klotho in the serum and performed better in a battery of cognitive tests than non-carriers. Again, this klotho effect was seen across a wide age range. Global klotho elevation also prevented AD-related synaptic, neural network and cognitive dysfunctions in human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) transgenic mice. We hypothesize that klotho improves neural functions in both normal and diseased brains through a mechanism that is independent of aging. We also hypothesize that augmenting klotho or its effects can counteract the pathogenic effects of elevated amyloid-? (A?) levels in the brain and may help prevent AD. To test these hypotheses and help unravel the functions of this fascinating protein in the brain, we propose three specific aims. Aim 1 will explore whether increasing the peripheral production of klotho improves synaptic and cognitive functions or whether klotho levels must be elevated within the blood-brain barrier to achieve these beneficial effects. It will also ascertain the relative importance of secreted klotho released from choroid plexus epithelial cells into the cerebrospinal fluid versus full-length klotho expressed in specific neuronal populations. Aim 2 will examine the functional importance of klotho expression in the CNS at different life stages and define the potential pathogenic impact of klotho depletion from the brain, which occurs with aging and is prominent in humans with AD. Aim 3 will explore potential mechanisms by which increased klotho levels enhance synaptic and cognitive functions, with a particular emphasis on glutamate receptors and related signaling pathways. The proposed studies will fill important knowledge gaps and could provide critical guidance for the development of klotho-related therapeutics in independent projects."
"9260372","RESEARCH TRANSLATION CORE PROJECT SUMMARY The Research Translation Core (RTC) of the METALS Center will utilize a unique network built over nearly four decades to facilitate the multidirectional translation of information among our researchers and trainees and to impacted Native American communities, local, regional and national governmental partners, other SRP researchers and important end-users to address real and immediate concerns related to mixed metals exposures from abandoned uranium mining sites. Our hypothesis is that increased multidirectional translation and communication supports more informed prevention, research, and policy decisions. The RTC aims (1) establish research translation forums among UNM METALS researchers, trainees, and cores to identify and translate research products within METALS and to other SRP programs; (2) expand our communications interface across a network of governmental agencies at the tribal, state, and national levels with shared information needs on the health effects and risk reduction strategies for metals mixtures exposures; (3) develop and apply unique multi-directional research translation frameworks to provide timely and understandable information to community partners and other important end users to enabling them to engage in setting policy and future research directions; and (4) ensure technologies and method developed through the UNM METALS SRC are made available through direct training of partners and, when appropriate, through commercialization supported through UNM?s STC.UNM technology transfer support. The unique perspective of the RTC leadership on translating findings to indigenous communities and perspectives of tribes to regulators, clinicians, and scientists will ultimately influence the way research is designed and conducted with the engagement of Native communities, and also fulfills the need for data on exposures and health impacts of AUM on indigenous communities."
"9530992","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) derived endothelial cells (ECs) have enormous potential to be used in a variety of therapeutic areas such as tissue engineering of vascular grafts and re-vascularization of ischemic tissues. It is also much desired to obtain homogeneous culture of functional arterial or venous ECs for specific applications. To date, various protocols have been developed to differentiate ESCs toward vascular ECs. However, ECs derived from ESCs using current methods display predominantly venous phenotype. Therefore, developing refined method of arterial-venous differentiation is critically needed to address this gap. Based on the findings of vascular development, we hypothesize that embryonic stem cell derived Flk1+Nrp1+ cells serve as arterial EC progenitors. We think that this subset cell population is predisposed to arterial differentiation and can be selected to guide arterial differentiation in combination with environmental cues. Our preliminary data support this hypothesis. The goal of this study is to further test this hypothesis using human ESCs. We will then engineer optimal in vitro environments that guide ESCs into arterial and venous cell fate and compare their functional consequences in tissue engineering applications. Specifically, we will: (1) Validate that Nrp1 can be used to identify arterial EC progenitor from stem cells and define optimal in vitro environments that guide ESCs into arterial and venous cell fate. (2) Analyze the ability of ESC-derived arterial and venous ECs to form interconnected functional vascular network in tissue-engineered construct both in vitro and in vivo. (3) Determine the functional consequences of ESC-derived arterial and venous ECs in the remodeling of tissue engineered vascular graft both in vitro and in vivo."
"9324836","Abstract: In Vivo Imaging Facility (IVIF)  Early detection of tumors, metastases and pre-metastatic cell types is critical for improved survival and cures in  cancer patients. In addition, there is a vital need for development and application of quantitative methods that  can detect, and even predict, the response of tumors to therapy with high sensitivity and accuracy. The NCI  has long recognized the potential of advanced imaging as an approach for using minimally invasive biomarkers  to measure tumor pathophysiology and to monitor the effect of targeted cancer therapies as an approach to  measuring therapeutic efficacy. Adding to its potential for guiding patient therapeutic management is that fact  that advanced imaging can be repeated throughout a course of therapy to provide frequent monitoring of  response. Molecular imaging is ideally suited for both early detection and measuring early therapy response  by quantifying cellular metabolism, proliferation, and apoptosis, and other processes altered early in treatment.  To achieve high levels of accuracy and effectiveness validation of advanced imaging techniques, specific for  relevant cellular processes, are required, that can detect and measure the efficacy of novel anticancer  therapies and measure early tumoricidal response. New PET tracers and optical and MR methodologies to  sensitively and specifically quantify drug-cancer cell interaction are being developed and the IVIF provides a  shared resource for testing these tracers in rodent models of cancer, and validating promising assays in  humans through well-crafted quantitative imaging trials. The goal of the In Vivo Imaging Facility (IVIF) is to  provide pre-clinical and clinical imaging services to UPCI investigators to assist in visualizing mechanisms of  biomarker action, provide approaches for early disease detection and monitor therapeutic efficacy. The specific  aims of IVIF are to: 1)Assess biomarker expression throughout cancer treatment using a single modality or a  combination of modalities, both clinically and pre-clinically; 2)Develop methods for monitoring therapeutic  efficacy in humans as well as in rodent models of cancer; 3) Develop novel radiotracer and contrast agents for  pre-clinical oncological imaging that is eventually translatable to humans; 4) Develop human protocols for  cancer detection, diagnosis, and staging, and 5) Develop advanced methods for evaluating early therapy  response following treatment. Key services include PET radiotracer development and production for human  PET-CT and PET-MRI or pre-clinical PET-CT and clinical or preclinical assessment of biomarker expression  during cancer treatment and develops methods for monitoring biological therapy and for evaluating prognosis  following surgery.

"9380519","Project Summary Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease (CVD). Inflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular dysfunction (impaired endothelial function and increased large elastic artery stiffness) are highly prevalent in CKD and contribute to the high incidence of CVD in this patient population. In addition, patients with CKD suffer from high rates of cognitive decline for which we lack effective therapies. Thus, therapeutic interventions targeting inflammation, oxidative stress, vascular dysfunction, and cognitive impairment in CKD are a biomedical priority. Curcumin is a natural polyphenol with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant characteristics. It is safe and widely-available. Our preliminary data in old mice and healthy middle-aged (MA)/older adult humans indicate that curcumin administration improves endothelial dysfunction and large artery stiffness by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. We also found that 12 weeks of curcumin supplementation improves episodic memory in MA/older adults. The primary goal of this R01 application is to extend our findings in healthy MA/older adults to patients with CKD, a growing clinical population with extensive baseline vascular dysfunction and cognitive impairment who presently have few treatment options. We propose that curcumin improves vascular endothelial function and large elastic artery stiffness in MA/older adults with stage IIIb and IV CKD (estimated GFR 15- 45 mL/min/1.73m2). We will also assess the possible mechanisms by which curcumin improves vascular function and determine if curcumin improves cognitive function in these patients. Specific aim 1a will determine if 12 months of curcumin supplementation will improve brachial artery-flow mediated dilation (BA-FMD) (endothelial function) and aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV) (arterial stiffness) compared to placebo (randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study). Specific aim 1b will evaluate whether the curcumin-induced improvements in BA-FMD and aPWV are mediated by reduced oxidative stress, and will evaluate the effects of curcumin on systemic and endothelial cell markers of inflammation and oxidative stress. Importantly, specific aim 2 will evaluate the effects of curcumin supplementation on cognitive function, an important complication of CKD, using the NIH Cognitive Toolbox Battery. The study will be conducted by a highly experienced team of investigators at the Clinical and Translational Research Center at the University of Colorado-Denver Anschutz Medical Campus with support from Dr. Seals at the University of Colorado Boulder Campus and in collaboration with Dr. Tamura from Stanford University. Overall, the study has the potential to influence clinical practice guidelines in patients with CKD by establishing a novel, safe, and low-cost dietary supplement to reduce the burden of CVD in patients with CKD."
"9527917","PCOS is a highly heritable (-78%) non-Mendelian disorder. Nevertheless, the common PCOS genetic  susceptibility variants mapped by us and by others do not account for the observed heritability of PCOS.  This so-called missing heritability has also been observed for other common, highly heritable complex traits  such as T2D, height and body mass index (BMI). An explanation for this paradox that is gaining increasing  experimental support is that the observed heritability is due to infrequent or rare variants with larger  biological effects, in addition to the common variants already identified. Detection of these rare variants is  now becoming feasible with the advent of high-throughput Next Generation DNA Sequencing methodologies.  It is our overarching hypothesis that rare variants will account for a considerable proportion ofthe missing  heritability of PCOS. There will be two Aims: 1) To test the hypothesis that rare genetic variants account for  much of the deficit in heritability in women with PCOS. Whole genome sequencing will be performed to  identify genetic variants in PCOS families with a proband and three additional affected sisters, in probands  from the phenotypic extreme ofthe PCOS population and in women who remain reproductively normal  despite morbid obesity. Variants that may have functional consequences that are concordant in the four  affected sibs will be genotyped in the remaining family members in these families to identify those that co-  segregate with PCOS. These variants, as well as novel/rare variants that are found at elevated frequency in  the extreme phenotypes group(s), will be genotyped in the larger set of families with multiple affected sisters,  and in the larger case-control population. 2) To test the hypothesis that rare variants identified in Aim 1 are  associated with sex-specific metabolic phenotypes in PCOS. Genotype-phenotype associations will be  investigated to investigate whether variants mapped with the PCOS reproductive phenotype also have a  metabolic phenotype. Rare variants will be investigated in male first-degree relatives to determine if the  associated metabolic phenotypes are sex-specific."

"9330472","Core Summary This U19 proposal aims to achieve islet transplant tolerance in the setting of deceased (Project 1) and living (Project 2) donor transplantation. Both of these projects rely on the use of single cynomolgus monkey donor islets in transplantation tolerance studies. Further, islet processing for studies in Project 2 is especially challenging, as it requires sufficient quantity and quality of islets from partial pancreatectomy to restore glucose control. The main service aim of this centralized Islet Isolation, Quality Control, and Transplantation Core Facility for the U19 is to serve as a reliable resource for high quality monkey islets needed for islet transplantation in Projects 1 and 2, allowing consistent experimental results. We will (Aim 1) support Projects 1 and 2 on this U19 by isolating and distributing islets from deceased and living cynomolgus monkey donors for allo- or auto-transplantation using whole or partial pancreas, respectively; and (Aim 2) provide in vitro and in vivo quality control services on the islets that will be used for transplantation. A total of 12 allogeneic monkey islet transplants are proposed for Project 1 in which islets will be isolated from whole pancreata of donor monkeys after they are euthanized. Islets will be cultured for 24 hours prior to the transplant. A total of 24 partial pancreatectomy and islet isolation procedures will be performed for Project 2 in which islets will be processed from 70% partial pancreatectomy and transplanted back to the donor under kidney capsule immediately after purification. With additional 9 monkey islet isolations needed to test new lots of collagenase and neutral protease, a total of 45 monkey islet isolations for the entire U19 will be performed during the funded period. In order to better interpret the islet transplant outcomes and to be able to compare the results generated from different experimental islet transplantation groups in measuring the success of tolerance induction for islet graft protection, it will be critical to establish an internal control system to ensure all islets used for the transplant studies are viable and functional, as well as comparable between the different experimental groups within each project. We propose to utilize standardized measures, both in vitro and in vivo, to characterize the isolated monkey islets for correlation with allogeneic and autologous transplantation efficacy. These include islet equivalence calculation, sample purity estimation, glucose stimulated insulin release, cell death detection, and a marginal islet-mass transplantation in immunodeficient mice for evaluating islet function in vivo. In summary, the Islet Core will provide the expert technical services for both projects on this application by providing large quantity, high quality, and well-characterized purified monkey islets from individual donors for each transplant. In addition, we will provide consultation to develop strategies for using the services of the Core optimally and for solving problems that may arise. Most importantly, we anticipate the proposed service aims of processing and characterizing monkey islet cells will facilitate the ability of the outstanding investigators on this U19 to conduct research toward a cure for Type 1 diabetes."
"9404104","Abstract/Project Summary:  In the US, fewer than 6% of all youth living with HIV (YLWH) achieve HIV viral suppression. This health disparity extends to the entire HIV care continuum in that there is a strong association between younger age and later HIV diagnosis, lower engagement in care, lower levels of antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence, and worse HIV clinical outcomes. In response to this critical public health dilemma and aligned with the National Institute of Health's High Priority Topics of Research (i.e., ?to reduce health disparities in the incidence of new HIV infections or in treatment outcomes of those living with HIV/AIDS?), our research team proposes to develop a novel mobile health application (?app?) to improve engagement in health care and ART adherence and to pilot test this mobile health app in 18-29 year-old YLWH. The aims of our study are to: Aim 1: Build on our theory-guided model and formative work to complete the development of our novel personalized mobile health app, WYZ (pronounced ?wise?), for improved HIV clinical outcomes among YLWH. Our research team will work with the University of California, San Francisco's Information Services Unit to complete the development of WYZ using an iterative Human-Centered Design approach. This will be done by adding data integration with pharmacy and laboratory databases, creation of an Android-compatible version of the app based on our in-progress iOS version, refinement based on user-experience data from field testing, and qualitative interviews with the primary care providers of the youth participating in the field testing. Aim 2: Conduct a pilot randomized trial to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary clinical impact (i.e., adherence, plasma HIV RNA, and CD4+ cell count) of the use of WYZ among YLWH and their HCPs. Aim 2 consists of two sub-aims: 2a. Examine feasibility and acceptability of the use of WYZ based on defined metrics, acceptability through qualitative exit interviews, and preliminary clinical impact by virologic/immunologic outcomes with participants randomized to the intervention versus the wait-list control. 2b. Assess the acceptability of WYZ by participants' HCPs through individual qualitative interviews.  We hypothesize that our mobile health app will be feasible and acceptable and will result in improved HIV clinical outcomes. Our study is significant because it has the potential to improve engagement in care, ART adherence, and clinical outcomes among YLWH. Our study is innovative because we will employ a novel suite of technology-based methods to improve information, motivation, and behavioral skills in YLWH. Upon completion, we will be ready to test the efficacy of this app in a subsequent large-scale RCT among this population that is disproportionately impacted by HIV and at elevated risk for poor clinical outcomes."
"9305778","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Thousands of babies per year die or develop Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) in the US. BPD is a costly chronic childhood illness, and costs in total $17,481,047 annually. Survivors with BPD often suffer serious pulmonary and/or neurodevelopmental sequelae. While extremely-low birth-weight (<1000 g at birth) infants are at high risk of death or BPD, the most vulnerable are those born between 23 and 26 weeks' gestational age (GA). In this population, the rate of death or BPD was 68% in the recent 'SUPPORT' trial. There has been little improvement in incidence or severity of the disease. Novel interventions are urgently needed. We investigate two strategies to assist the transition from a fluid-filled in-utero lung to an air-filled lung after birth, in the first vital few minutesof life. Investigators and Prior Work: This prospective multi-national randomized Phase III trial, is led by an experienced, international productive team of trialists. They are collectively expert in ventilation or delivery room resuscitation or both. All PIs and co-Is have participated in or led multicenter or multi-national studies including PINT, TIPP, CAP, NIPPV, COIN and SUPPORT. Collectively, the leaders of this trial have established normative values of oxygenation in the delivery room; evaluated the use of a Sustained Inflation (SI) in the DR to establish breathing in the newborn; have demonstrated the use of non-invasive means of support in the delivery room as safe; tested a variety of lung interventions; and evaluated blood transfusion in the NICU. Approach: We will perform a RCT in preterm infants to determine which of two strategies at birth are best to optimally arate the lung. Specifically we will determine in 600 infants of 23-26 weeks GA needing respiratory support at birth which of two lung opening strategies - either a standard PEEP/CPAP of 5-7 cm H2O in the DR, as compared to early lung recruitment using SI in the DR, will result in a lower rate of the combined endpoint of death or BPD (using a standardized oxygen reduction test) at 36 weeks PMA? We will also compare which has the lower rate of other important secondary outcomes including rates of neurodevelopmental impairment at 18- 24 months of corrected age in survivors. The answers to these questions are highly relevant to the mission of the NICHD. Trial results will impact ILCOR and NRP guidelines. Environment: The combined clinical and data coordinating site at University Pennsylvania has a track record in the conduct of large international trials. We have partnered with a total of ten very influentia and recognized site investigators world-wide. We believe this trial is feasible within these sites, all of which have successfully completed many previous influential clinical trials in preterm infants. These trials have often changed clinical practice."
"9358707","The effects of drinking alcohol within recommended limits on risks of CVD, diabetes, and related diseases are  perhaps the most important questions yet to be answered in the fields of alcohol, nutrition, or prevention.  Approximately half of all adults worldwide report current or former alcohol consumption, and the benefits or  risks that alcohol poses to their health urgently need clarification. Epidemiological studies have consistently  found that alcohol intake within recommended limits is associated with lower risk of coronary heart disease,  ischemic stroke, and diabetes, yet no long-term randomized trial of alcohol consumption on risk of any chronic  disease has yet been performed. In direct response to PAR-16-363 (Multi-Site Randomized Controlled Clinical  Trial Research Center on Alcohol's Health Effects), we propose a worldwide, six-year, balanced-design  randomized trial, comparing the effects of one standard serving (~14 grams) of alcohol intake daily to  abstention on risk of CVD, diabetes, mortality, and related outcomes among 7,800 adults at above-average  cardiovascular risk worldwide. To maximize feasibility and reflect actual use most closely, we propose to test  alcohol consumption per se to abstention and thus to offer participants flexibility in their choice of beverage,  while employing novel and intensive yet efficient methods to monitor safety. The Primary Specific Aim of this  trial is to determine the effects of 14 gm of alcohol intake daily compared with abstention on risk of major  cardiovascular events or death (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hospitalized angina, need for  revascularization, or death) over an average of 6 years of follow-up among 7,800 adults aged ?50 years with  estimated 10-year CVD risk ?15% or prevalent CVD >6 months prior to enrollment. Secondary Aims will test  the effects of alcohol on risks of incident diabetes and major cardiovascular events. Tertiary Aims will test risks  of hard cardiovascular events and progression to impaired fasting glucose. Similar to other large randomized  trials, we will establish ~16 centers worldwide using a stepped approach, with a 9-month vanguard phase  among 7 centers in the US, Europe, Africa, and South America (in this application), followed by a second wave  of additional sites to complete enrollment. Participants will be monitored for safety in multiple complementary  ways, including brief electronic real-time reporting and validated yearly instruments and laboratory measures.  We have brought together highly successful groups in the US and Europe to establish clinical, data, and  biospecimen coordinating centers, our field centers include many of the most experienced clinical trialists  anywhere, and our group has strong working relationships with NIAAA and other NIH staff necessary to ensure  seamless collaboration during a U10-funded cooperative research endeavor. In this application, we propose  the first randomized clinical trial of alcohol consumption, aiming to determine whether it increases or decreases  the risk of CVD and diabetes among adults at above-average cardiovascular risk worldwide."
"9353802","Summary  Glioma, the most common brain tumor in adults, develops as a result of aberrant growth and invasion of astrocytic tumor cells. Even with aggressive treatment, survival is very poor and is attributed to the presence of therapy-resistant tumor-initiating cells (TICs), which are highly migratory and invasive and thus render complete surgical tumor removal impossible. Engineering therapies that target glioma tumor cells and TICs may enable enhanced efficacy and as a result longer clinical survival times in patients afflicted with this disease. Accordingly, this proposal is focused on the development of gene therapy strategies for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), an aggressive form of glioma, based on the targeting of GBM tumor cells and TICs.  Adeno-associated virus (AAV) has emerged as a safe and promising vector for gene delivery applications. However, viral vectors in general, and AAV in particular, do not display strong intrinsic cell tropism for glioma cells in the central nervous system (CNS), and in addition they experience a number of delivery and transport barriers for systemic delivery to clinical GBM, including biodistribution to the CNS, the blood brain barrier, and intraparenchymal and intratumoral transport to the primary and diffuse secondary tumors. Thus, it is highly desirable to develop vectors that can be systemically delivered and that are capable of overcoming these delivery barriers.  We propose to engineer the coat proteins of AAV to target delivery to glioma tumor cells and TICs to greatly enhance delivery efficiency and reduce any biological off-target effects. We hypothesize that AAV directed evolution, a strategy we originally developed and have successfully employed to enhance viral vector properties, can be implemented to engineer AAV vectors in vivo for enhanced and potentially selective tropism for GBM tumor cells and TICs. Specifically, we propose to harness (1) a mouse model based on the xenografting of primary cultured, patient-derived GBM TICs that accurately represents the hallmarks of GBM, (2) highly diverse AAV vector libraries, and (3) a sophisticated directed evolution strategy that includes a stringent in vivo selection selective for viral particles that can localize to the CNS and transduce GBM tumor cells and TICs. We have successfully recovered viral genomes from the first round of evolution, highlighting the potential of this strategy. We also propose to characterize the resulting engineered AAV vectors by studying their tropism and biodistribution, essential gene delivery properties for clinical implementation.  Furthermore, we propose to evaluate the therapeutic potential of engineered AAVs by delivering two promising therapeutic genes that can hamper tumor progression and extend the survival of our animal models, or that offer promise in future exploration of cancer immunotherapies. This blend of molecular virology, protein engineering, and a translationally accurate animal model will therefore enable the engineering of enhanced genetic delivery systems for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme and in the future potentially other cancers."
"9381581","Abstract: Disparities exist in access and outcomes of kidney transplantation. More than half of patients are hospitalized in the year after transplantation, and these patients are more likely AA and have lower socioeconomic status. Several studies have identified risk factors for hospital admission using traditional statistical methods, but models have been limited by moderate predictive accuracy, the use of static (rather than dynamic) models, and the use of administrative data that may not capture the changing risk factors pre- to post-transplant. The overall goal of this research is to develop and validate rigorous, dynamic risk prediction models, integrate these models within a clinician dashboard, and develop potential interventions to address surgical disparities in hospitalization following kidney transplantation. Our specific aims are 1) To develop and validate predictive models to identify transplant recipients at high risk of hospitalization following transplant; 2) To use a community-based participatory research approach to build an electronic hospitalization risk dashboard that will aid in clinical decision-making and guide the use of scarce resources for patients at high risk for hospitalization post-transplant. The overall impact of this proposal is to improve transplant outcomes and reduce disparities among a primarily AA ESRD population in the Southeastern US."
"9410948","Abstract: The proposed project will build evidence-based, community-rooted public health responses to the epidemics of non-medical prescription opioid (NMPO) and heroin injecting, overdoses (ODs), and HCV, and to imminent HIV outbreaks, in 12 rural Appalachian Kentucky counties at the epicenter of these intertwined national crises. 10 counties rank in the top 5% for HIV/HCV vulnerability. Rates of HCV, injection drug use (IDU), and ODs are high in these counties, and most are in coal country, an RFA priority.  Unfortunately, these counties exemplify an extreme version of the ?implementation chasm,? a chasm dividing scientific knowledge from action. Evidence-based public health responses to these epidemics exist (e.g., syringe service programs [SSPs]) and are often deployed in cities. In these 12 rural counties, though, scarcities of resources and of providers conspire with drug-related stigma to constrain public health responses. The counties' public health infrastructures are weak, their harm reduction infrastructures virtually non-existent.  This project will bridge the implementation chasm in these 12 counties, and recognizes that bridging this chasm requires more than simply importing SSPs and other evidence-based community response projects (EB-CRPs) from cities. Guided by harm reduction principles, the Risk Environment Model, and Community/ Academic Partnerships (CAPs), in the UG3 we will: (1) Assess and enhance each county's readiness to improve the local risk environment. (2) Examine the strengths, resources, needs, and gaps of each county's risk environment. We will conduct a multi-method Community Assessment of the Risk Environment that integrates innovative, rigorous epidemiology (e.g., modeling); policy assessment; and best practices in community-based research (e.g., CAPs). (3) Select a package of EB-CRPs that responds to local needs and strengths, using elements of Intervention Mapping. Go/no go milestone: Each CAP will have created an EB- CRP package that (1) addresses targets common across all counties (e.g., opioid injection, OD, HCV, HIV), and (2) is tailored to local needs, resources, and readiness. In the UH3, we will: (4) Tailor selected EB-CRPs to each county's context using ADAPT-ITT. (5) Analyze the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of each county's EB-CRP package, using an innovative stepped-wedge community randomized trial and mathematical models. We will use continuous quality improvement to enhance each EB-CRP's fidelity, reach, immediate effects, and outcomes. To inform interventions, advanced network analyses will overlay risk networks with GHOST phylogenetic transmission data to show where HCV has been and predict where it is going. We draw strength from our collaborations. CAPs will meld residents' local knowledge with researchers' scientific expertise. Multi- PIs Young and Cooper have assembled an academic team with unsurpassed expertise in key substance, theories, and methods, and in multisite studies. The combination of a rigorous, innovative design (e.g., step- wedge community trials), strong theories, and a stellar team with community roots will ensure high impact."
"9284290","Project Summary/Abstract  Approximately 400,000 smokers survive an Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS; unstable angina, ST and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction) each year in the US. The occurrence of ACS can be conceptualized as a ?teachable moment,? whereby patients may be more receptive to smoking cessation messages. Continued smoking following ACS is an independent predictor of mortality. Depressed mood post-ACS is also predictive of mortality, and smokers with depressed mood are less likely to abstain from smoking following an ACS hospitalization. Thus, a single, integrated treatment that targets both depressed mood and smoking could be highly effective in reducing post-ACS mortality. Behavioral Activation may be an ideal counseling treatment for this population because it is easy to train, can be delivered by Bachelor's degree level practitioners, and has recently shown promise for enhancing cessation outcomes in smokers with depression. Through extensive pilot work we systematically developed a counseling intervention that integrates gold standard smoking cessation counseling with Behavioral Activation based mood management for post-ACS smokers; Behavioral Activation Treatment for Cardiac Smokers (BAT-CS). The overall aim of the current study is to conduct a fully powered efficacy trial enrolling 324 smokers with ACS and randomizing them to 12 weeks of BAT-CS or control (including full attention match). Both groups will be offered the nicotine patch if medically cleared. Follow-up assessments will be conducted at end-of-treatment and 6, 9, and 12 months after hospital discharge. We will track the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events and all-cause mortality for 18-36 months post-discharge. The primary outcomes will be depressed mood and biochemically validated 7-day point prevalence abstinence. The specific aims of the study are: Aim I: Test the efficacy of BAT-CS vs. control on depressed mood and smoking cessation. Aim II: Test the efficacy of BAT-CS vs. control on cardiac health. Aim III: Explore hypothesized mediators of treatment effects. Aim IV: Explore the temporal interaction of smoking and multiple aspects of mood over 1 year post-ACS. The long-term goal of this line of research is to improve long-term survival rates following ACS."
"9430710","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is for a HIV Research and Training Program (HRTP) between the University at Buffalo (UB) and the University of Zimbabwe (UZ). The HRTP will build on a recently completed AIDS International HIV Research and Training Program that was focused on re-initiating postgraduate training at the Master's level in HIV clinical pharmacology research at UZ. Scientific breakthroughs in HIV prevention and treatment research have produced evidence suggesting that interventions involving early access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) are highly effective in preventing HIV sexual transmission and vertical transmission during pregnancy, childbearing and delivery. Government and academic leaders in Zimbabwe have identified HIV Clinical Pharmacology Research as a key component of national planning for ARV access and HIV therapeutics to implement these scientific breakthroughs. The UB-UZ HRTP will focus on novel aspects that integrate clinical pharmacology research with: 1) ARV adherence, 2) clinically important pharmacokinetic drug interactions (e.g. anti-tuberculosis drugs, anti- malarials, hormonal contraceptives and traditiona medicines), 3) ARV disposition during pregnancy (secondary to WHO Option B+ implementation) and in infants, and to determine in utero ARV exposure, and 4) bioequivalency testing for generic ARV products prior to widespread implementation. These research areas integrate well with other NIH funded projects and regional capacity building. The HRTP will broaden the training focus to include masters, doctoral and post-doctoral trainees and emphasize a curriculum that provides an HIV Clinical Pharmacology Research Skills Toolbox for HRTP trainees to gain the skillset that will be required to be an independent researcher. HRTP trainees will gain focused clinical pharmacology research training at UB in an internationally recognized HIV Clinical Pharmacology Laboratory that complements the UZ Clinical Pharmacology Laboratory program. The UB-UZ HRTP has strong support from the UZ College of Health Sciences and the Ministry of Health. The HRTP will benefit from an expert Training Advisory Committee and a complement of highly motivated faculty that will provide the curriculum, structured research training and program evaluation that will assure a highly productive, efficient HIV research training initiative."
"9420374","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has transformed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection into a chronic disease. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in HIV is an important cause of morbidity and mortality is thought to have the the worst prognosis of any subtype of PAH with presenting symptoms often including dyspnea and exercise limitation (ExLT), commonly attributed to other disorders. In this grant application, we propose a prospective study to understand the cardiopulmonary responses and PAH in HIV using echocardiography in conjunction with exercise magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cardiopulmonary testing. We further propose innovative assessment of inflammatory parameters in HIV that will provide insights into the mechanisms of cardiopulmonary dysfunction and elevated PA pressures. Our hypothesis is that HIV- ExLT patients commonly exhibit alteration in RV function/PA pressure with exercise (ExPH), with the latter phenotype representing a high-risk cohort for progression to resting PAH. In Aim 1, we will institute a protocol of ExMR and CPT that will allow measurement of RV function, mean PA pressure (mPAP) and VO2max in response to exercise to define the prevalence and distinguish patients with abnormal exercise contractile reserve (¿ RVEF). In aim 2 we will investigate longitudinal changes in resting RV volume, contractile reserve and predictors of progression with a focus on measures of CD8 T cell immune activation and exhaustion and their relationship to progression of PAH. In aim 3, we will follow patients with established or newly diagnosed resting HIV-PAH and evaluate changes in resting RV function, volume and fibrosis and correlate these changes with alteration in invasive hemodynamic parameters at 12 months. We will attempt to delineate the predictors of progression in this patient population. Our proposal is highly responsive to RFA-HL-14-023 and will allow early identification of right heart disease, answer fundamental questions pertaining to cardiopulmonary response with exercise in HIV and lead to appropriately designed outcome trials to prevent PAH and associated functional limitations.

"9447689","Project Summary Homeostasis is a fundamental physiological property, maintaining crucial state variables within a specific range for the viability and fitness of animals. Homeostatic mechanisms are also important for motivated behaviors, such as feeding or sleep. For example, prolonged wakefulness increases sleep drive (sleep pressure), leading to an increase in sleep amount and/or depth (sleep rebound). The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the homeostatic regulation of sleep remain unclear, and we have recently identified a novel neural circuit that encodes sleep drive. Although sleep drive is widely assumed to inevitably increase with greater wakefulness, exceptions to this rule exist in nature, particularly under conditions of high arousal. We hypothesize that specific signaling mechanisms act on this homeostatic circuit to suppress the accumulation and/or release of sleep drive. The overall goal of this proposal is to leverage these new findings to unravel the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying sleep homeostasis. In addition, emerging data suggest an important role for glia in the homeostatic regulation of sleep. Thus, we propose to carry out the following aims: 1) characterize the signaling pathways acting on this novel circuit to regulate sleep drive; 2) characterize the circuit mechanisms acting downstream of this sleep homeostatic circuit to promote sleep; and 3) investigate a specific role for glia in the homeostatic regulation of sleep. To carry out these studies, we will use a variety of approaches, including behavioral assays, molecular genetic analyses, immunohistochemistry, functional imaging, and patch-clamp electrophysiology. These studies should reveal new insights into how sleep is homeostatically regulated. Insomnia and disorders of pathologic sleepiness are common and often associated with substantial morbidity. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying sleep homeostasis may help in our search for novel treatments for both pathologic sleepiness and insomnia."
"9328148","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis a fibrotic interstitial lung disease characterized by a median survival of 3-5 years post-diagnosis but exhibits heterogeneous longitudinal disease progression. Recent studies of novel agents confirm beneficial effects on longitudinal change in forced vital capacity but inconsistent benefits on clinical endpoints or health status. Both agents are difficult to tolerate and are likely to be prohibitively expensive. Conducting clinical trials to assess clinical endpoints requires that larg numbers of patients are enrolled and followed for a sufficient period of time. The inability to rapidly recruit sufficient numbers of IPF patients means that many key clinical questions have not been addressed. Restrictive inclusion criteria ensure that patients enrolled in clinical trials often differ from those seen in clinical practice. There remains a critical need to use innovative, pragmatic study designs to identify well tolerated and inexpensive therapies which improve clinical outcomes in patients with IPF. Our group was the first to identify that an abnormal lung microbial community is independently associated with disease progression in IPF subjects. Additional preliminary data link this to a circulating gene expression signature of altered host response. Intriguingly, one investigative group has suggested improved clinical outcomes in IPF patients treated with trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole compared to a matched placebo. The totality of these data suggests that an abnormal lung microbiome interacting with genetic susceptibility in host response may be associated with impaired clinical outcomes in IPF. Our principal hypothesis is that antimicrobial therapy in IPF patients will improve clinical outcomes. Our long-term goal is to define patient-specific therapy in IPF. Using a pragmatic trial design CleanUP-IPF will remove many of the known obstacles to clinical trial enrollment in order to recruit a patient population that is highly representative of those seen in clinical practice. We anticipate demonstrating that: 1) a large, pragmatic study in IPF is feasible and will identify clinically meaningful endpoints beyond FVC; 2) anti- microbial therapy will improve clinical outcomes; and 3) genetically predisposed patients will experience differential response to therapy. CleanUP-IPF will revolutionize future studies in IPF and provide data that will alter therapeutic guidelines."
"9331629","Title: Purinergic Regulation of Bladder Interstitial Cells of Cajal Abstract: Urinary incontinence, overactive bladder (OAB) and neurogenic bladder often arise from inappropriate bladder smooth muscle (BSM) motility and the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Pacemaker cells, also known as interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) are likely to play a critical role in modulating bladder smooth muscle function but this recently defined cell, is almost completely unstudied. Infants born without bladder ICC (BICC) - a lethal condition called megacystis-microcolon intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIHS) ? have a complete absence of autonomic voiding function and die with dilated bladders, underscoring a vital role for BICC in modulating BSM. The long-term goal of this research, in alignment with several stated goals of the National Urology Research Agenda, is to fully understand the interactions of neurons, BICC, and BSM in regulating bladder motility. The objective in this particular application is to identify the purinergic signaling pathways which operate in BICC and how they function to regulate BSM motility. We hypothesize that purinergic signaling to BICC will regulate BSM motility through calcium signaling and gap junction transmission. Guided by strong preliminary data demonstrating novel purinergic receptors, P2X2/6 and A2a expression on BICC and observing that activation of these receptors induces BSM contraction/relaxation, we will investigate our hypothesis through the following four specific aims: 1) to demonstrate that BICC mediates BSM contraction through activation of P2X2/6 heteromeric receptors; 2) to define whether P2X2/6 activation results in Ca2+ release from ER and mediates BSM contraction through gap junction transmission; 3) to define whether activation of A2a receptors relaxes BICC-mediated BSM contraction through inhibiting Ca2+ signaling; and 4) to determine whether ectonucleotidase Entpd2 regulates P2X2/6 and A2a receptor function and bladder motility through modulating the availability of ATP and adenosine on BICC. Due to the compelling preliminary data which defines the feasibility of this plan, we expect Aim 1 to be completed during the mentored phase of the project and the resulting manuscript prepared and submitted for publication. Preliminary experiments in pursuit of aims 2 and 3 will likely have begun in this initial phase also, thereby generating important momentum for completion of the remaining aims during the independent research phase. The approach we propose is innovative and integrative. To achieve our aims we have established a new method to study BICC-mediated BSM motility. We will use multiple genetically modified animal models to investigate the involvement of various signaling pathways using bladder muscle strip myography in conjunction with specific pharmacological modulation of receptors, real-time calcium imaging and mass spectrometry. We expect this research to vertically advance our understanding of how BSM motility is regulated by BICC, and eventually establish a novel BICC?BSM interaction model that will shift the paradigm for how bladder motility is regulated. Ultimately, this work may define new treatment solutions and molecular targets for bladder disease."
"9409977","PROJECT SUMMARY There is an increasing public concern about monitoring water quality in the entire drinking water supply system, especially at the point of use, spurred by recent water catastrophes, such as the one in Flint, Michigan that has caused severe health issues for thousands of children due to the unsafe level of lead in contaminated drinking water. Current quantitative detection methods for aqueous lead are often laboratory-based and are too expensive and time-consuming, unsuitable for end water users to perform fast and onsite detection. This project aims to investigate the feasibility of a handheld device for real-time, onsite detection of toxic lead in tap water. The device integrates a novel micro-sized sensor chip built upon a graphene-gold nanoparticle sensing platform with a portable digital signal meter for direct readout of testing results. This project intends to address the need for quantitative, real-time, in situ detection of total dissolved lead ions in tap water by developing a sensitive, specific, fast, portable, and cost-effective prototype handheld device that can be self-administered without any special training. Major innovations of the project lie in the use of an aqueous sensing platform with superior sensing performance (i.e., high sensitivity, excellent selectivity, and fast response under laboratory environment and in field settings) and the combination of the sensor with a digital meter for direct display of testing results in tens of seconds. The sensing platform consists of a multifunctional hybrid nanostructure (i.e., graphene as the sensing signal transduction channel and the support for gold nanoparticles functionalized with chemical probes), which is capable of differentiating lead ions from other aqueous ions (e.g., calcium and magnesium) through specific coupling events between the lead ion and the specially chosen chemical probe (i.e., glutathione) on the gold nanoparticle surface. Specific research aims of the project are to: (1) Determine the influence of pH value on the sensor performance so that sensing results can be interpreted properly; (2) Develop a model to estimate the total dissolved lead based on the measurement of free lead ion concentration in water and implement this model in the handheld device for reporting total dissolved lead concentration in water; (3) Study how potential interfering species in tap water (e.g., disinfection by-products) affect the sensing behavior of the handheld device and to identify possible strategies to minimize the undesirable interference. The technical and commercial feasibility of the handheld device and associated technology will be determined for future development and commercialization. The proposed activities will improve the sensing reliability and device integrity, maximizing the commercialization opportunities of the device. The availability of the device contributes to safeguarding the public drinking water safety, as this innovative sensing technology permits fast, onsite test of lead ions in water supply systems, particularly at the point of use. The framework of the device is also expandable with the potential to serve as the basis to build a sensing network for real-time water quality monitoring of the entire drinking water system, enhancing the public drinking water safety."
"9409492","Abstract: Mosquito-borne flaviviruses cause disease worldwide, with members such as dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV) and west nile virus (WNV) infecting more than 100 million individuals annually. The availability of small molecule antivirals that reduce flavivirus infection therefore could have an immediate and substantial impact on public health programs that seek to improve outcomes for populations infected with WNV, DENV, and ZIKV. Recently, genome-wide screening using either insertional mutagenesis or CRISPR-Cas9 knockout approaches have identified subunits of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST), specifically STT3A and STT3B, as essential for the flavivirus life cycle. Drug discovery efforts using a novel bioluminescent reporter that detects inhibition of OST function have also had recent success with the identification of novel small molecules that target the OST [13]. This class of inhibitors directly engage with the STT3A and STT3B subunits and therefore have the potential to be antiviral agents for the treatment of flavivirus infection. The proposed research seeks to structurally optimize the potency and solubility of this drug-like small molecule series in order to advance this therapeutic strategy for preclinical testing."

The Translational Neuroimaging Core C will support U54 users in the above areas for magnetic resonance  (MR) neuroimaging as well as psychophysiological measures. The Core?s services can be broadly construed  into two different categories: (1) those that are responsive to investigators? needs and (2) those that are  generative, and provide new directions in IDD for investigators to leverage. Investigator need-based services  provided include assistance in (a) experimental design, including selecting appropriate tasks for functional  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or electroencephalogram (EEG)/event-related potentials (ERP), (b)  identification of the optimal modalities of MR imaging or EEG/ERP/eye tracking acquisition parameters, (c)  implementation of MRI and EEG/ERP data collection with special populations (individuals with various IDDs,  especially infants and children), and (d) management and analysis of MRI and EEG/ERP/eye tracking data.  The generative and innovative component of the Translational Neuroimaging Core C focuses on key areas that  are of particular interest for IDD researchers: design of novel experimental paradigms optimized for IDDs;  increasing data quantity and quality; and conducting data analysis on a large scale (e.g., across studies). To  this end, the Core will focus on developing robust image processing techniques to handle challenging data  (e.g., movement artifacts) and leveraging BioVU resources using ?big data? approaches.  While expertise and resources in neuroimaging, advanced computing, and data management tools are  available at Vanderbilt University, none are tailored for the special needs of those who study IDDs. The Aims  and services in Core C all have the central goal: to facilitate cost-efficient discovery that leads to the prevention  and/or amelioration of IDD. Each member of the Core has strong ties to the larger Vanderbilt community, thus  enabling seamless linkages between entities at Vanderbilt that are critical for the Core. The Core will serve 17  funded IDD research-related projects, along with the Research Project (PI: Wallace)."

He has training in medical sociology, ethnographic methods, and health disparities research. His previous and current work has exposed him to theoretical perspectives and empirical approaches pertinent to health disparity and aging research among men. The current proposal is for a five year Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) from the National Institute on Aging for training and support that address gaps in his knowledge of biobehavioral factors underlying Alzheimer?s Disease (AD) dementia related mild traumatic brain injury mTBI and accelerated cognitive aging. In collaboration with his mentoring team (Drs. Tim Strauman, Keith Whitfield, and Toni Antonucci) he has developed a comprehensive training and research plan that will both fill in these knowledge gaps and prepare him for an independent research career. The overarching goal of his K01 is to gain expertise on the interrelationships between multiple measures of psychosocial and neurocognitive factors associated with AD dementia related accelerated cognitive aging, and serve as bridge for him to establish an independent investigator career in conducting biobehavioral health disparities research in adult male populations. To accomplish this goal, he proposes four career development activities and three research aims that combine instruction with established scholars in survey research techniques; formal coursework; participation in ongoing seminars at Duke and the University of Michigan; one-to-one directed readings with mentors; and finally, conducting of a ?proof of concept study? from start to finish. Data will be collected using a mixed-method design that consists of a survey, focus groups, and in-depth interviews. The three research aims will enable him to integrate and apply knowledge gain through the proposed training activities by creating a more robust portrait of psychosocial protective and risk factors that may impact the long- term consequences of mTBI among men than previously possible. The approach used in this project will address; a) male vulnerabilities in predicting the impact of psychosocial factors on accelerated cognitive aging and b) how understandings of masculinity develop across and within groups in relationship to pain, injury, and brain health. This project will continue to build on insights he has gained through his examination of data from the Study of Retired NFL Players. By completing these aims, he will test important hypotheses and make substantial evidence based contributions to describing the process of dementia related cognitive accelerated aging resulting from mTBI. This proposal is relevant to public health because it will explore innovative approaches to address functional, cognitive, and psychosocial vulnerabilities in concussed men, and may ultimately reduce the risk of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), and Alzheimer?s disease resulting from concussions. It will also inform an R-series grant proposal to study AD dementia related accelerated cognitive aging and brain imaging that Dr. Turner plans to submit in year 4 of the project."

Through distinct and innovative approaches we seek to transform higher education by fully integrating research and teaching. Transformation to a culture of integrated research and teaching will occur through student, faculty, and institutional development that address institutional, social, and individual factors influencing engagement and persistence of emerging scientists. BLaST will engage students in active learning, early research experiences, and learning communities that engender confidence in knowledge and status as researchers, and motivate persistence. UAF is committed to undergraduate research training and infrastructure-building grants from the NIH have dramatically increased our biomedical research capacity. The next step is to integrate these elements and enhance capacity for undergraduate biomedical research training. We focus on recruiting rural students and will implement BLaST at 9 rural Alaskan campuses by partnering with llisagvik Tribal College, University of Alaska Southeast, and rural campuses. Alaska, as the most rural state and one with extreme educational and economic disparities, is the ideal test case for transformative approaches to engage and support rural students. Pursuit of 3 specific aims will enable achievement of goals: Specific Aim 1: Emphasize active and experiential learning throughout undergraduate curricula, thereby building capacity to engage students, rather than capacity simply to serve students. Specific Aim 2: Fully integrate teaching and research in the higher education enterprise, thereby immersing students in biomedical research throughout their undergraduate study. Specific Aim 3: Embed students in a biomedical learning community that takes a holistic approach to student development by emphasizing cultural inclusiveness and comprehensive advising as well as training in critical-thinking and problem-solving skills, which are hallmarks of scientific training RELEVANCE (See instructions): Through integration of research and teaching at the Fairbanks campus and integration of rural institutions and their students into the biomedical research enterprise in Alaska, the proposed BLaST program will improve active and experiential learning opportunities and outcomes for all students interested in biomedical research careers, including those from underrepresented groups."
"9243829","PROJECT SUMMARY  Better ways to treat genetic metabolic disorders are needed. More than 30 inborn errors of metabolism are predicted to lead to a functional deficiency of coenzyme A (CoA), including most conditions detected by expanded neonatal screening. Defects of fatty acid and amino acid metabolism generate high levels of organic acids, which form intracellular acyl CoA esters and lead to the sequestration or redistribution of CoA. Two primary inborn errors of CoA biosynthesis are now recognized, as well. Coenzyme A is critical to a diverse range of cellular processes, including intermediary metabolism, transcriptional regulation, signal transduction, and autophagy. Therefore deficient bioavailable CoA would disrupt myriad cellular processes and contribute to chronic morbidity in people affected by these diseases.  Current state of treatment: The mainstay for managing this diverse group of disorders is early diagnosis, prevention of catabolic stress, and treatment with dietary modifications that decrease precursor availability and deliver small molecules (carnitine and glycine) to facilitate urinary excretion of toxic metabolites. While this general approach has improved survival of the acute toxic states, few of these patients are in good health. They suffer from a persistent abnormal metabolic state often with failure to thrive, neurodevelopmental disabilities, dysrhythmias, chronic liver disease and other complications, problems that are predicted to arise in part from depletion of CoA. The primary inborn errors of CoA synthesis cause lethal pediatric neurodegenerative disorders for which there are currently no treatments.  Why is this R21 proposal innovative? Here, we propose a novel approach that will not only elucidate the pathophysiology of selected inborn errors metabolism but will also provide a ?go-no go? decision for use of a precursor in CoA synthesis as a rational therapeutic to replenish CoA levels. Phosphopantetheine, a key intermediate in the synthesis of CoA, was recently discovered to serve as the stable precursor for rapid CoA synthesis. Using animal models representing four distinct CoA depletion disorders (propionic acidemia; glutaric acidemia type 1; very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency; and pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration), we propose to 1) demonstrate that these mutant animals are more sensitive than controls to selective CoA depletion; and 2) demonstrate the efficacy of phosphopantetheine in ameliorating disease- associated biochemical and clinical defects. These R21 exploratory investigations have the potential to contribute important knowledge to the understanding of these diseases and to advance development of phosphopantetheine and its derivatives for further human studies. If successful, the work could fundamentally change management of 30+ human diseases and significantly improve the lives of tens of thousands of people with poor therapeutic options."
"9546867","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Postpartum mood disorders (PMD) are the most common complication of childbirth and cause significant morbidity and mortality. Postpartum depression (PPD) has a prevalence of 10-15% and is the most frequent type of PMD. Postpartum psychosis (PP) is a rare but severe form of PMD that can result in tragic consequences including suicide and infanticide. The relationship between PPD and PP is uncertain, as is their relationship to major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BIP). PPD may or may not be a variant of MDD, and PP may or may not be a variant of BIP. We propose here a rigorous investigation of the epidemiology and genetic epidemiology of PPD and PP using Danish national population registers. Moreover, in contrast to BIP or schizophrenia, efforts to identify the genetic basis of MDD have been complicated by etiological heterogeneity, and genetic studies of PPD may advance these efforts, as PPD may be a more homogenous phenotype involving exposure to a similar biopsychosocial stressor. A robustly replicable finding in psychiatric genomics has been risk profile scores (RPS-polygene scores). There is now strong evidence that RPS measure genetic liability to a psychiatric disorder. We propose to add RPS to our evaluation of the epidemiology and genetic epidemiology of PPD and PP as a critical mechanistic element. The Danish registers form the basis of a longitudinal study of nearly all health care contacts since 1968 and include 4.5 million women plus data on their partners, family members, and offspring. Moreover, at no cost to this study, we will be able to use individual genotypes from a large cohort. We propose: (1) to conduct a cohort study of risk factors of PPD and PP in Danish national registers to examine pre-pregnancy, pregnancy/puerperal and postnatal risk factors, (2) assess the genetic epidemiology using the Danish registers to aggregate the populace into pedigrees and estimate a) familiarity of PPD and PP, b) familial coaggregation of PPD with PP, MDD and BIP in first-degree relatives as well as for PP with PPD, MDD, and BIP, and c) estimate heritability and environmentality (shared and individual-specific) of PPD and PP; and (3) perform a mechanistic assessment of PPD and PP using RPS to develop a predictive model of who will develop PPD and PP and longitudinal risk of recurrent MDD and BIP. PMD are a first rank public health problem. We currently have a poor understanding of who will develop PPD or PP, and whether and how the two disorders are related. We urgently need improved understanding of the epidemiology, genetic epidemiology, and mechanisms of PPD and PP. These unique Danish population data provide the necessary sample sizes and statistical power for comprehensive longitudinal studies relevant to the mechanisms underlying PMD. Successful completion of this proposal would provide new knowledge crucial to understanding the risk factors and course of PMD that could eventually also prove to be key to understanding the etiology of mood disorders outside the perinatal period."
"9324846","Abstract: Biobehavioral Oncology Program (BOP)  The overarching goal of the Biobehavioral Oncology Program (BOP) is to increase understanding of the  reciprocal interactions between the central nervous system (CNS) and cancer, with the long-term objective of  contributing to reduced risk of cancer development, improved cancer treatment response, reduced symptom  burden, and enhanced survival. Grounded in the behavioral sciences, Program investigators conduct basic,  preclinical, clinical, and translational research that is largely focused within two central themes: 1)  biobehavioral analysis of patients? responses to cancer, cancer treatment and survivorship, with a particular  focus on symptom experience; and 2) biobehavioral analysis of cancer development and progression with a  particular focus on smoking. Both include crosscutting research on psychological stress. The specific aims of  BOP are to: 1) Promote and support transdisciplinary research on the role of psychological, biological and  behavioral aspects of CNS activity in patients? responses to cancer, cancer treatment and survivorship with a  particular focus on symptoms, using animal models, clinical investigations, and randomized clinical trials of  novel intervention strategies; 2) Promote and support transdisciplinary research on the role of psychological,  behavioral, and biological aspects of CNS activity in the development and progression of cancer with a  particular focus on smoking, using animal models, human experimental investigations, community-based  studies, and randomized trials of biobehavioral interventions, and 3) Promote and support transdisciplinary  research examining effects of psychological stress on cancer development and progression, as well as on  patients? responses to cancer, cancer treatment and survivorship. The BOP has 39 members representing 14  departments and 4 schools across the University of Pittsburgh including dedicated academic researchers  focused on biobehavioral oncology and clinician-researchers who combine research with patient care  responsibilities, as well as members devoted to clinical activities. BOP members currently receive $11 M  annually in direct funding, including $1.8 M from the NCI and $9.1 M in other peer-reviewed support. Between  January 2010 and April 2014, BOP members authored 503 cancer-related publications, of which 25% resulted  from intra-programmatic and 14% resulted from inter-programmatic collaborations and approximately 60%  represent collaborations with external investigators. UPCI support, including Clinical Protocol and Data  Management and shared resources, specifically the Animal Facility, Biostatistics Facility, Cancer  Bioinformatics Services, Cancer Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics Facility, Cell and Tissue Imaging  Facility, Chemical Biology Facility, Cytometry Facility, Immunological Monitoring and Cellular Products  Laboratory, In Vivo Imaging Facility, and Tissue and Research Pathology Services facilitates and enhances  BOP research."
"9355672","ABSTRACT As the Research Project of the Rose F. Kennedy IDDRC program, we propose to uncover the basis of intellectual disability (ID) in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS; DiGeorge syndrome/velo-cardio-facial syndrome). The 22q11.2DS is a congenital malformation disorder occurring in 1/4000 live births. Affected children suffer from cognitive impairment that ranges from mild to moderate and that frequently co-occurs with behavioral disorders. Most patients have a similar sized 3 million base pair (Mb) deletion, while some have nested proximal or distal deletions. The deletions occur sporadically by meiotic non-allelic homologous recombination events between blocks of low copy repeats that map to the 22q11.2 region. Most clinical findings in 22q11.2DS are relevant to the broader, general population but occur at a much higher frequency in affected individuals. For example, the prevalence of intellectual disability (ID) in the general population is 1- 3%, but virtually all children with 22q11DS have mild cognitive impairment and 50% have ID. Since the syndrome has a known genetic etiology, it is possible to identify the genes responsible for ID and explain the basis of phenotypic heterogeneity in patients. Once these are identified, mechanistic studies can contribute to our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of ID, which will increase our knowledge of this common deficit. Our hypothesis is that haploinsufficiency of genes within the 22q11.2 region, including CRKL, encoding a cytoplasmic adaptor protein that functions in intracellular signaling, influences the severity of neurocognitive findings in patients with 22q11.2DS. We propose three specific aims to test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will perform genetic studies to evaluate deletion size compared to phenotype, and analyze whole genome sequence on the remaining allele of 22q11.2 in 1,000 patients with the 3 Mb deletion from existing sequencing data. Further, we will examine patients with varying deletion sizes for neurocognitive and EEG findings. In Aim 2, we will perform testing in mouse models to study the role of Crkl in brain development and function, and perform basic gene expression validation studies from discoveries found in Aim 1. In the pilot Aim 3, we will generate induced pluripotent stem cell lines from patients with varying deletion sizes and differentiate them to neurons to identify differential gene expression that will guide future genetic studies and drug screens. Overall, we believe this integrated approach will uncover new insights into the basis of ID in 22q11.2DS."
"9541276","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In addition to long known contributions from particular MHC class II molecules, there is growing appreciation that in both humans and NOD mice some MHC class I variants also play an essential role in autoimmune type 1 diabetes (T1D) development by mediating pathogenic CD8 T-cell responses. The overall goal of this renewal application continues to be dissection in NOD based mouse models of the mechanistic basis for MHC class I restricted diabetogenic CD8 T-cell development, and use of this information to identify potentially clinically translatable means to attenuate such effectors. While the H2g7 MHC haplotype encoded Kd and Db class I molecules are essential to T1D development in NOD mice, they are common variants also characterizing many non-autoimmune prone strains. This suggested H2g7 MHC class I molecules aberrantly mediate diabetogenic CD8 T-cell responses in NOD mice through interactions with some of the many other disease susceptibility (Idd) genes characterizing this strain. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis based on preliminary mRNA transcript profiling and congenic truncation analyses that a hyper-expression variant of the NFkB inhibitory Nfkbid gene located within the previously identified Idd7 locus is an important contributor to the failure of diabetogenic CD8 T-cells to undergo thymic negative selection in NOD mice. Similarly, epidemiological studies indicate that in humans certain common class I molecules such as HLA-A2.1 can aberrantly contribute to T1D development also likely through a genetically contextual process. Indeed, we found that when expressed in the context of the NOD genome, human HLA-A2.1 molecules mediate diabetogenic CD8 T-cell responses. HLA-A2.1 restricted diabetogenic CD8 T-cells in this NOD background stock primarily recognize two peptides each derived from the pancreatic ss cell proteins insulin (INS) and islet specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit related protein (IGRP). Immunological tolerance can be efficiently induced to antigens bound to autologous leukocytes by the cross-linking agent ethylene carbodiimide (ECDI), and such an approach is in a clinical trial as a possible multiple sclerosis intervention. However, there are many hurdles to cell based therapies, and possible T1D intervention approaches can only be considered in humans already at a late prodromal stage of disease development. Therefore, to broaden potential clinical translation, Aim 2 will test the possibility supported by new preliminary data that treatment with synthetic microparticles bearing appropriate ECDI coupled INS and/or IGRP autoantigenic peptides can exert late disease stage T1D protective effects in NOD-HLA-A2 mice, and/or enables reversal of established disease by pancreatic islet transplantation. Finally, epidemiological evidence implicates B39 as a potentially highly potent diabetogenic HLA class I variant in humans. Thus, Aim 3 will assess whether transgenically expressed B39 molecules mediate diabetogenic CD8 T-cell responses in NOD mice, and if so, identify ß cell autoantigens displayed by this class I variant, and test their capacity to serve as broadened disease intervention reagents."

"9298410","Major Strengths Of The JAXCC    The major focus of the JAXCC is to understand the complex genomics of cancer that leads to primary resistance to therapy, that enables cancer cell adaptation and evolution, and that pushes progenitor cell transformation. Our ability to address these topics comes from our capabilities in developing technologies and analytics for interrogating the cancer cell genome combined with the exceptional ability ofthe JAXCC to query the function of single genes and large-scale genomic changes using a diverse range of genetically defined mouse strains, reference populations, and unique heterogeneous stocks.      Collaboration and programmatic integration are deeply embedded in the scientific culture of The Jackson Laboratory. The limited size of our faculty demands such an operating principle. The JAXCC provides a leadership and administrative structure, and is organized as one research program to further enhance transdisciplinary collaboration and integration within our three-campus structure. Throughout the previous grant cycle, this emphasis on collaboration has been shown in both the number and breadth of joint publications and grants from JAXCC members. Figure 2 depicts the network of interactions among current JAXCC members, based on the number of joint authored publications from the JAXCC as well as funded and pending joint grant submissions in which JAXCC members are co-PIs or named as key personnel. The external collaborative network is also robust, as evidenced by the 58% of publications in the last grant cycle co-authored with external investigators."

"9339318","Project Summary/Abstract  Long-duration low-level (LDLL) noise exposures can enhance or depress sound-evoked activity in the auditory cortex (AC), but it?s unclear if these neuroplastic changes originate in the AC or are inherited from lower levels of the auditory pathway. To address this, recordings will be obtained from the cochlea, inferior colliculus (IC) and AC to determine the magnitude and direction of change. To determine if LDLL noise exposures disrupt the neural input to the central auditory pathway, we will evaluate the inner hair cell pre- synaptic ribbons and key proteins expressed on the post-synaptic type I afferent fibers. Our working hypothesis is LDLL noise exposure depresses the neural output of the cochlea, but the central auditory pathway compensates for this by enhancing neural gain at progressively higher levels of the auditory pathway."
"9353815","ABSTRACT We propose to characterize associations among the fecal microbiome, the fecal glycome, and measures of household environmental exposures in infants who do and do not subsequently develop autism spectrum disorder (ASD) from the MARBLES cohort. One of the most common co-morbidities in autism are gastrointestinal problems, and the presence of frequent symptoms of diarrhea or constipation is associated with more severe symptoms. However, virtually all research on GI dysfunction in ASD to date has been conducted after the ASD diagnosis has been made, thus not allowing for examination of temporal relationships between GI dysbiosis and the onset of ASD. Moreover, few underlying biologic mechanisms have been identified. Increasingly, the prominent but insufficiently characterized, role of the microbiota in human health has been recognized. Environmental influences on individual gut microbiota profiles are also coming under scrutiny, but there has been very little work on the impact of chemical exposures on the microbiome. Taking advantage of data and samples available from a large, prospective pregnancy study of high-risk infant siblings of children with autism, this project seeks to investigate the development in early postnatal life of the individual profiles of the gut microbiome, the environmental chemical influences on these, and their relationship to GI symptoms and to the subsequent development of autism and its early signs. Our overarching hypothesis is that environmental exposures common in developing countries influence the developing intestinal microbiota and intestinal permeability in the first year of life and that the resultant dysbiosis and gut ?leakiness? increase risk for development of ASD. With an established interdisciplinary team at the cutting edge of the microbiome and glycome measurement, we will use recently developed effective techniques to quantify fecal milk glycans and milk glycan monomers that are clear drivers for intestinal health or dysbiosis in the developing infant gut microbiome. We will apply an innovative mechanistic framework that incorporates a number of known or suspected factors in GI dysfunction in ASD, including a compromised intestinal barrier, and links exposure to environmental toxins, GI outcomes, and ASD. Establishing associations between the maternal and child environment, the developing infant gut microbiome, and onset of ASD symptomology and diagnosis would set the stage for mechanistic studies examining ways to shift the infant microbiota away from onset of dysbiosis during the first year of life?a critical developmental period?with potential implications for neurodevelopmental outcomes."

Core B will support all five projects and will provide biostatistics and bioinformatics assistance, as well as critical expertise and standardization in sample and library preparation and initial confirmation to aid in prioritization of targets. Core B is responsible for the pre-processing, integration and modeling of the diverse readouts (e.g., transcriptomics, phosphoproteomics, secretomics etc.) generated by each project as well as across projects within the PPG. These data will be incorporated into probabilistic pathway models to provide a rigorous and reproducible framework for hypothesis testing. Follow-up validation and perturbation experiments will aid in the evaluation and refinement of the modeling in an iterative manner. To ensure the data from all PPG research projects will be generated in a standardized manner, the GBBC will play a critical role in facilitating PPG studies, managing and integrating the diverse experimental read-outs, assessing reproducibility and guiding identification of the most promising candidates for validation. The GBBC will regulate consistency and quality of the samples to be sequenced by performing both CD34+ HPC infection experiments with virus mutants generated by the different projects, and subsequent RNA isolations for RNA-seq to allow for cross-comparisons of datasets. This core will assist in prioritization of candidates for further perturbation and validation studies.

"9345352","Abstract Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of death globally, affecting almost 6 million people in the United States alone. Up to 50% of these patients will die within five years of diagnosis, making elucidation of the mechanistic underpinnings imperative so they can be evaluated for therapeutic potential. Evidence from our lab has shown that phosphodiesterases (PDEs) that degrade cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) have great utility as druggable targets in heart failure. These PDEs ultimately block protein kinase G (PKG) signaling, a known cardioprotective pathway; hence blockade of PDE activity results in cardioprotection. Several cGMP-specific PDEs are present in the heart, namely the nitric oxide-linked PDE5a and the natriuretic peptide-linked PDE9a. These PDEs are compartmentalized to specific regions of the cell, although little is known about this compartmentation for PDE5, and nothing is known for PDE9. Part of this proposal aims to study this compartmentation using novel molecular tools such as compartment-targeted PKG inhibitors and tagged PDEs that can be used to determine subcellular localization and compartment-specific proteomes. Knowing the specifics of the PDE5 and PDE9 compartments may clarify how these PDEs can be manipulated for therapeutics. Previous in vivo studies have demonstrated that inhibition of PDE5 has great therapeutic utility in male animal HF models, but has fallen short in female mice lacking estrogen (comparable to HF in postmenopausal women) and in human HF with preserved ejection fraction patients. These shortcomings are due to the regulation of nitric oxide by estrogen and the depression of nitric oxide levels in HF, respectively. Recently we revealed that inhibition or genetic deletion of PDE9a, the other cGMP-specific PDE in the heart, attenuates cardiac hypertrophy in male mice. The PDE9 pathway acts independently of the nitric oxide/PDE5 pathway, making it a promising drug target in situations where PDE5 inhibition is ineffective. We hypothesize that inhibition of PDE9 will result in improved cardiac function in rodent pressure-overload models independent of sex and sex hormone status. This hypothesis will be tested in a female pressure-overload HF model using C57Bl6 mice treated with PDE9 inhibitors and PDE9a knockout mice lacking estrogen."
"9389693","Project Summary: The studies herein are inspired by the concept that tumors can no longer be perceived through enumeration of the genetic mutations within the malignancy. The tumor microenvironment contributes key signals that influence cancer progression. Our long-term goal is aimed at modulating the local environment to inhibit disease progression, and these studies are aimed at identifying paracrine signaling that may drive abnormal growth. While the composition of the surrounding tumor microenvironment has been connected to disease progression, strategies for identifying the key paracrine factors emanating from the stroma are limited. Our approach is based on the intersection of secretomics (i.e., derived from RNAseq) with large-scale measurements using a TRanscriptional Activity CEll aRray (TRACER) to quantify transcription factor (TF) and micro RNA (miRNA) activity in order to identify key factors and pathways driving the observed phenotype. Macrophages are the immune cells present at the greatest levels in a primary tumor. The components of the tumor and its environment determine the phenotype of tumor associated macrophages (TAMs). The propensity of the TAMs to promote tumor growth and metastasis, or act tumoricidal or tumorostatic, is an oncongenic cell process that has been termed immune editing. The variable behavior of TAMs as a function of the tumor properties may contribute to the differential outcomes among patients, and TAMs are being investigated for their prognostic value. Specific Aim 1 will investigate paracrine communication between cancer cells and TAMs that can impact the ability of TAMs to promote or inhibit invasive phenotypes. Initial studies will investigate the bi-directional education of macrophage/monocyte populations and the cancer cells. Subsequently, mammary epithelial cells or cancer cells will be co-cultured with macrophages of varying phenotypes (pre-infiltrating monocytes, tissue-resident macrophages, and TAMs) and investigate the evolving communication between the cells that leads to tumor-promoting or tumor-inhibiting microenvironments. Specific Aim 2 will extend the TRACER technology to the single cell level (i.e., bioluminescence microscopy) to investigate signaling within the most invasive cancer cells. Heterogeneity within the tumor population is increasingly appreciated as an important contributor to the observed cancer phenotype. These studies capture the active TFs/miRNA associated with invasion, and identify the factors with distinct activity that underlie the differential phenotype of the invasive cell relative to the non-invasive cells within the population. The ability to capture the dynamic activity of numerous TF/miRNAs at single cell resolution can be employed to track the cues driving cell fate decisions, which is not achievable through other methods and provides novel perspectives into cancer biology and cancer immunology. Finally, we investigate the paracrine signaling and TF/miRNA activity in the context of chemotherapy and impact on the tumor microenvironment, as compensatory signaling may serve as a therapeutic target to enhance the efficacy of current cancer treatments."
"9245289","ABSTRACT The life span of organisms differs widely among species: C. elegans live 14-25 days, mice for a couple of years, humans into their eighties on average, and organisms such as the giant clam can live upwards of 500 years. There are likely conserved mechanisms that regulate the efficiency of cell function in youth that declines with age, ultimately resulting in systemic and organismal failure and death. In spite of the large number of ideas that have been proposed to account for the loss in efficiency and function as an organism ages, no common integrative theory for aging that is evolutionarily conserved has been advanced and thus, represents a major gap in knowledge. The oxygen paradox highlights the mystery that O2 is so critical a fuel for the metabolic machinery of life, yet so toxic to all forms of life inhabiting this planet. The key to this paradox are the two simple, yet biologically fundamental redox reactions: the first reaction, which is essentially the reverse of photosynthetic water splitting, marks the dawn of eucarya in which mitochondria `respire' oxygen to enzymatically generate proton gradient fueling oxidative phosphorylation and the second reaction where O2 in excess is consumed to generate reactive species that induce damage. To maximize the first reaction and minimize the second, life needed to maintain oxygen levels under tight control. It has been proposed that the evolutionary response to this paradox was to create cholesterol within membranes as a way to ?tame? oxygen and allow for its biologic use as an energy source and as a primary feature that links membranes and metabolism. We hypothesize that caveolin, a scaffolding protein that organizes cholesterol into membrane microdomains, exists as a ?capacitor? to create the efficiency of metabolism in youth through regulation of membrane oxygen and that with aging, caveolin expression is decreased in certain organs, thereby leading to increased oxygen toxicity. We further propose that this toxicity can be limited by re-expression of caveolin in the setting of advanced age. The following specific aims will be studies: Specific Aim 1: Determine what aspects of caveolin serve as membrane oxygen capacitors. Specific Aim 2: Determine the impact of age and caveolin expression on organ oxygen storage capacity and toxicity."
"9432273","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is among the most significant and preventable risk factors for developing osteoarthritis (OA). Efforts to identify the causes of this risk have traditionally focused on obesity-induced triggers of joint stress, such as mechanical and inflammatory factors. However, there is a fundamental gap in our understanding about how obesity impairs chondrocyte cellular defense mechanisms resulting in inappropriate or insufficient responses to joint stresses. The applicant's long-term goal is to develop strategies t either up-regulate chondroprotective pathways or down-regulate cell catabolic pathways that become dysregulated with obesity and aging. The objective here is to determine how obesity increases the acetylation of mitochondrial proteins that ultimately regulate cartilage catabolism under aging and inflammatory conditions. This focus is derived from the applicant's exciting preliminary data linking an age-related decline in the regulation of mitochondrial protein acetylation by the mitochondrial deacetylase SIRT3 to impaired antioxidant defense and OA. The central hypothesis is that obesity exacerbates an age-related increase in chronic mitochondrial hyper-acetylation resulting in chondrocyte redox stress and cartilage catabolism. It is proposed that this imbalance is driven by an aging-dependent decline in SIRT3 expression coupled with an obesity-driven increase in acetyl-CoA production and inflammation. Preliminary data show that the mitochondrial antioxidant, SOD2, is a key target of hyper-acetylation in chondrocytes. Guided by these and additional preliminary data, the hypothesis will be tested by three specific aims: 1) Determine how obesity induces metabolic changes that promote mitochondrial protein acetylation; 2) Determine the aging and obesity-dependent effects of manipulating SIRT3 expression, positively or negatively, on chondrocyte redox homeostasis and cartilage catabolism; and 3) Identify the mechanisms by which SIRT3 regulates mitochondrial redox homeostasis and activation of cartilage catabolic pathways following a pro-inflammatory challenge. Well-established mouse models of diet-induced obesity and OA will be used in combination with genetically modified mice that allow for the conditional deletion or over- expression of SIRT3 in cartilage. Targeted genomic, proteomic, and metabolite detection methods are in place for aims 1 and 2 to determine the factors that promote mitochondrial acetylation, alter antioxidant capacity, and induce OA. Aim 3 will use ex vivo interleukin-1 stimulation assays to identify SIRT3-sensitive cartilage catabolic pathways. Mice with cartilage-specific deletion of SOD2 will provide a reference for evaluating the effect of SOD2 hyper-acetylation on chondrocyte oxidative stress and activation of downstream catabolic pathways. This approach is innovative because it shifts the focus of obesity research on OA from cellular stress triggers to stress susceptibility. The proposed research is significant because it will initiate the systematic study of how reversible post-translational lysine acetylation of mitochondrial proteins may be manipulated, either positively or negatively, to promote chondroprotection with aging and obesity."

Elucidating the mechanisms of FPE will advance our understanding of a host of heterogeneous causes of ASD and holds the potential for illuminating novel and highly potent interventions for a majority of ASD-affected children. The overarching goals of this research project?which is designed to capitalize upon the infrastructure of the IDDRC@WUSTL)--are to predict and elucidate the mechanisms of sex-specific modulation of susceptibility to ASD. The strategy is to take 3 logical (and related) ?next steps? in understanding FPE?which may operate at the level of cell, brain, and/or behavior, and across disparate autosomal causes?to inform new intervention targets relevant to a diversity of familial autistic syndromes. Specific Aim 1 is designed to inform translational advances in risk prediction and genetic counselling for female carriers of inherited ASD susceptibility and their offspring. Using an internet-based registry of over 20,000 ASD-affected families (http://ianproject.org) in which over 2500 unaffected sisters of ASD probands?now of child-bearing age?were historically characterized for quantitative autistic traits, we will test predictions of offspring ASD risk as a function of sex (of infant) and quantitative variation in maternal phenotype. Specific Aim 2 is to determine the extent to which categorical and quantitative variation in expression of the ASD phenotype in ?carrier? adult females relate to previously-published neural (brain MRI) signatures of susceptibility and compensatory function in ASD. Specific Aim 3 is an exploratory aim to develop a preliminary resource for the elucidation of cellular signatures of FPE. We will establish human iPSC-derived neurons from 4 families transmitting separate autosomal ASD-causing variants (each with 2 ASD-affected males and 1 carrier female, 2 cell lines per individual, for a total of 24 cell lines). We will explore whether within-family cellular contrasts are appreciable between affected males and carrier females by examining axon and dendrite morphology as well as the development and function of synapses in the differentiated neurons. If candidate cellular signatures of FPE emerge, we will use these preliminary data to justify subsequent applications (to submit in years 4-5) to pursue a next phase of investigations critically informed by these studies."

"9344597","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes a four-year basic science training program for the development of a career in academic Pediatric Gastroenterology. The principal investigator, Dr. Elizabeth A. Marcus, a Clinical Instructor in Pediatric Gastroenterolog at the University of California, Los Angeles with a projected title of Assistant Professor as of 7/1/13, is board-certified in General Pediatrics and Pediatric Gastroenterology. She completed Pediatrics residency at Children's Hospital Los Angeles. She participated in basic science research, studying the acid acclimation mechanisms and bacterial physiology of the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori throughout medical school, residency, and fellowship. The current proposal incorporates a newly developed and divergent research focus, studying the effect of the bacteria and acidic pH on the gastric mucosa. The program outlined in this proposal will provide the applicant with an excellent research environment and protected time to attain the skills needed to achieve her goal of becoming an independent investigator. The mentor, Dr. George Sachs, is a recognized expert in gastric physiology, acid secretion, and bacterial factors associated with H. pylori acid acclimation. Dr. Sachs has a strong history of mentoring graduate students and postdoctoral fellows who have progressed to become independent investigators. Co-mentor Dr. David Scott will contribute expertise on H. pylori, microscopy, animal models, and eukaryotic cell systems. Co-mentor Dr. Charalabos Pothoulakis will provide expertise on inflammation and mucosal immunology. An advisory committee will monitor career development and provide additional training in immunology, mass spectrometry and epithelial physiology. The Department of Pediatrics has already committed 75% protected research time to the applicant. UCLA provides a rich research and academic environment that will foster the development of research independence.  The proposed research focuses on how H. pylori, in coordination with gastric acidity, is able to injure the gastric mucosa and trigger development of advanced disease. H. pylori infection is highly prevalent worldwide and at a minimum causes gastric inflammation. Some of those infected progress to develop gastric or duodenal ulcer disease, gastric atrophy, and cancer. Treatment is becoming more difficult with emerging antibiotic resistance and problems with patient compliance with a complex treatment regimen. It is not definitively known how the bacteria are able to evade the immune system, leading to lifelong infection, or what factors contribute to development of advanced disease, although multiple bacterial and host factors have been studied. This proposal will use in vitro and in vivo model systems with physiologic similarities to the host environment to determine epithelial changes and alterations in immune response. Quantitative mass spectrometry using SILAC (Stable Isotope Labeling by Amino acids in Cell culture) technology will be used to study protein changes in the cell junction in response first to acidity, then to H. pylori infection. Candidate proteins or pathways will be inhibited to confirm involvement. Confocal microscopy will be used to further study the cell junctions in co-culture with acidic pH. Cell layer resistance and permeability changes will be characterized. Mediators involved with the Th1 and Th17 immune responses will be studied in the context of H. pylori infection and acidic pH. H. pylori genes with increased expression in acid and in a gerbil model will be studied as potential modulators of immune response. Potent acid inhibition with a novel acid blocker in infected gerbils will be employed to determine the effect on bacterial load, inflammatory infiltrate, and cytokine production. It is anticipated that this work will add to the understanding of the mechanisms of gastric injury and will lead to development of novel treatment targets for both the infection and its short and long term consequences to the host."

"9328121","Tobacco smoke has a devastating impact on health, particularly on lung health. It is the most common cause  of chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) and lung cancer. It also has synergistic effects on numerous other  lung diseases, including interstitial lung disease and pneumonia. Most mouse models of tobacco smoke related  lung disease expose mouse strains to tobacco smoke. This model usually results in mild-to-moderate  emphysema, but little or no evidence ofthe chronic bronchitis, which is a large component of COPD in humans.  Our aim is to establish a model of tobacco smoke-induced lung injury that mimics that found in humans. This  work will address the FDA CPT research interest, Adverse Health Consequences. The goal ofthis project is  to determine what animal models can be validated to establish standard toxicity changes and what  magnitude observed within in vivo assays correlates with change in human health outcome (point 31).  As described in Project 1, smoke exposure leads to decreased activity of CFTR, resulting in absorption of  water from airway liquid, dehydration of mucus, and poor mucociliary clearance. Transgenic mice  overexpressing Scnnib, the gene which codes forthe epithelial Na* chanriel subunit (pENaC), in the  epithelial cells ofthe airways mimic this aspect of tobacco smoke, showing mucus cell metaplasia, mucus  hypersecretion and obstruction, neutrophilic inflammation, large foamy macrophages, and increased  numbers of lymphocytes in both the lumen and the walls ofthe ainways. These mice also show evidence of  an MMP-12-dependent emphysematous component to the injury. Thus, the lungs of these mice develop  pathology that mimics changes found in COPD patients, highlighting the striking effects of airway  dehydration. However, these mice are missing all other effects of tobacco smoke, which are likely to be  many due to numerous components of tobacco smoke. We are modeling tobacco smoke exposure in  humans by exposing Scnn1b-tg mice to prolonged (6 month) tobacco smoke exposure. Our studies to date  suggest that this model mimics the human injury more closely than mouse models to date. In particular, gene  expression analysis suggests that smoke exposure in Scnnlb-ig mice results in more similarities to human  disease in both detoxification pathways and in immune regulatory pathways. Other similarities to date include  changes in mucins within the airways and the presence of large numbers of vesicular exosomes. Thus, we  propose to test the hypothesis that smoke exposure in Scnn1b-tg mice is an excellent model of human  disease and can be used more effectively than either wild type (WT) mice or other mouse models of COPD to  study particular components of smoke or to compare tobacco products or substitutes."
"9392794","SUMMARY Household air pollution (HAP) is the third leading risk factor for morbidity and mortality worldwide, and the leading cause of respiratory disease in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). HAP is largely the result of inefficient combustion of solid fuels (biomass) for cooking and heating. Biomass fuel is the main domestic energy source used by ~50% of urban households and ~90% of rural households globally and is a potential public health intervention with significant impact on morbidity and mortality. Although there is evidence that reducing HAP results in better health outcomes, few interventions aimed at more efficient or better ventilated cook stoves which utilize biomass (i.e clean cook stoves) have produced significantly improved pulmonary health outcomes. This is largely due to the fact that prior interventions have not use clean fuels and could not reduce HAP to levels the produce meaningful outcomes. Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LGP) has been proposed as a clean fuel alternative to traditional biomass cook stoves. We hypothesize that reducing HAP with LPG intervention will produce improved pulmonary health outcomes among adults and that these improvements will be dose-dependent. To study the effect of HAP on pulmonary health, we propose to apply detailed respiratory questionnaires and conduct spirometry among a subgroup (n=400) of adult women enrolled in an existing study, The Household Air Pollution Intervention Network trial (HAPIN). This proposal will leverage extensive environmental exposure data collected as part of the parent grant to assess the exposure-response relationship between HAP and respiratory symptoms and lung function. This proposal has two novel aims. First, to determine whether LPG intervention results in improved respiratory symptoms and improved lung function, we will apply detailed respiratory questionnaires and conduct spirometry at three time periods in the trial. Second to assess whether this effect is responsive to the type and amount of exposure, we will utilize environmental data assessing P2.5, carbon monoxide and black carbon exposure using novel causal inference measures. Results from this study will inform public health interventions aimed at reducing HAP and the burden of disease globally."
"9388081","Project Summary/Abstract  While prominent theories of addiction implicate physical dependence as a key predictor of drug use and relapse, the limited available research among Latinos has generally found that physical dependence has limited utility for predicting cessation. Further, Spanish-language instruments for measuring dependence multidimensionally have demonstrated poor psychometric structure among Spanish-speaking Latino smokers. These studies suggest that the mere translation of existing measures may not be adequate for developing effective assessments of tobacco dependence for Spanish-speaking smokers. Rather, there is critical need for an in-depth examination of the appropriateness of dependence scale translations and the relevance of item content for Spanish-speaking Latino smokers. As such, the aim of the current study is to use a mixed-methods approach to develop a theoretically grounded, multidimensional measure of smoking dependence and motives for smoking based on established measures but that is appropriate, reliable, and valid for Spanish-speaking smokers. We propose a four-phase study. Phase 1 will consist of cognitive testing of Spanish translations of the Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives (WISDM) and Nicotine Dependence Syndrome Scale (NDSS) items to identify potential problems with the items as currently translated. Phase 2 will consist of in-depth interviews of the lived experience of dependence among Spanish-speaking smokers of Mexican origin to inform item refinement and development of additional items. Phase 3 will consist of item refinement and development informed by data gathered in Phases 1 and 2. Phase 4 will consist of validation of the resulting refined Brief WISDM and NDSS scales, as well as an examination of the entire pool of resulting items for potential development of a different and possibly more appropriate measure. Such a project stands to significantly impact research among Latinos across the tobacco continuum by allowing for more valid assessments of dependence among Latinos, which could lead to novel culturally relevant knowledge of the processes involved in smoking initiation, maintenance, cessation and relapse."
"9412243","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Numerous studies demonstrate links between depressive symptoms or disorders and poor cognitive and functional outcomes. Anxiety symptoms and disorders, poor sleep, and stressful life events are common and correlated with depression, but little is known about their association with cognitive and functional decline, such as occurs in Alzheimer's disease (AD). These stress-related exposures are also associated with medical morbidity and disability, but the mechanisms linking them to poor health outcomes are unclear. Cross-sectional studies suggest that these exposures might lead to these outcomes by hastening cellular aging, measured by shortening of telomeres. Prospective studies in cohorts with well-characterized histories of stress-related exposures and repeated measures of cellular aging are needed to investigate this possibility. We propose to analyze these issues using data already collected in the Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) Followup Study cohort, adding another wave of data collection. The Baltimore ECA Study began collecting structured diagnostic interview data on depressive and anxiety disorders in 1981 in a representative sample of East Baltimore residents, and did so over three additional waves, most recently in 2004 (Wave 4). In addition to measures of anxiety and depressive symptoms and disorders, the diverse (35% African American) ECA cohort has completed repeated measures of poor sleep, life stressors, trauma exposure, cognition, and functional impairment. In 2004, when all participants were aged ?40 years, they donated blood and buccal samples. All ECA subjects are now aged ?50 (estimated mean = 68, range 52-96). We will locate and interview an estimated 601 participants from Wave 4, repeating structured diagnostic interview assessment of mental disorders, and measuring life stressors, trauma exposure, and poor sleep by both self-report and wrist actigraphy. Participants will complete neuropsychological tests and functional measures, and will again donate blood and buccal samples. This will enable us to determine the association of 35-year histories of stress- related exposures, from mid to later life, with cognitie and functional decline, adjudicated mild cognitive impairment and dementia diagnoses, including probable and possible AD, and biomarkers of cellular aging: shortening of telomeres and increases in p16ink4a levels from 2004 to 2016. We will also determine if these exposures are associated with epigenetic modification of genes in the ECA that we select based on novel genome-wide association and methylation analyses we will conduct in existing data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) and the InCHIANTI cohorts. We will examine whether methylation of these candidate sites, and measures of inflammation (measured in blood in 2004 and 2016) in the ECA, mediate hypothesized predictive associations in the ECA cohort. Results will clarify the link between stress-related exposures from mid to later life and aging-related outcomes, advance knowledge of mechanisms linking these exposures to disease and disability, and provide clues to avenues for preventing these outcomes."
"9320647","ABSTRACT ? Partnership Core The Partnership Core will provide resources and support for partnership activities essential to the execution of the proposed research. The proposed Research Program builds on the foundational work of the Northwest- Alaska Pharmacogenomic Research Network (NWAP), a Center within the NIGMS Pharmacogenomic Research Network. NWAP has worked in 3 tribal settings in Alaska and Montana to conduct a range of research studies related to pharmacogenomics, providing the basis for the present proposal, in which studies of gene-environment-drug (GED) interactions and polygenic-drug interactions (PGD) related to anti-coagulant and anti-platelet therapy will provide knowledge for improving the health care of American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) people, and will inform model investigational approaches. NWAP research procedures have been accomplished through respectful university-community partnerships, guided by the values and procedures of community-based participatory research (CBPR). The Partnership Core will assure the CBPR functions essential to the maintenance and continued growth of the strong partnerships established in this research consortium. These include procedures to assure tribal oversight of research procedures and convening of groups for collaborative discussion of issues arising in the research. We have identified three priority objectives for Partnership Core deliberation: (1) Bi-directional capacity development, assuring appropriate training and orientation for university-based investigators with little experience in tribal research partnerships, in particular graduate students and post-doctoral fellows involved in laboratory-based components of our studies, and parallel training and orientation about biomedical research for community- based partners; (2) Return of research results, developing appropriate procedures for the return of research results at each site, in anticipation of clinically relevant findings; and, (3) Data sharing, exploring collaboratively the development of data-sharing mechanisms that will accomplish the goals of NIH policy while retaining tribal oversight and control of data. These activities will support the Core goals of sustaining and growing existing community groups and collaborative procedures and assuring collaborative effort in the implementation of Projects 1, 2 and 3, including the development of appropriate strategies to assure responsible research practice."
"9546880","The National Survey of Family Growth is a survey of U.S. men and women of reproductive age conducted on a continuous basis by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). The survey provides national estimates concerning factors related to fertility, family formation, family planning, and reproductive health including HIV infection and other sexually transmitted diseases. NCHS conducted 6 discrete cycles of the NSFG since 1973; NICHD participated in funding four of these: Cycle 3 (1982), Cycle 4 (1988, with a 1990 telephone re-interview), Cycle 5 (1995), and Cycle 6 (2002). Beginning in 2004, the survey transitioned to a continuous data collection process, with data releases occurring on a regular basis once sufficient cases have been accumulated (about every two years, subject to the availability of funds, while a contract with a survey firm is in place). This design benefits NICHD by providing larger samples at more frequent intervals than under the NSFG's old periodic design, and at the same time maximizing cost efficiency. Data collected by the NSFG provide essential information for NICHD's program planning, particularly in program areas related to contraception, fertility and infertility, pregnancy planning, pre-term birth, HIV prevention, and family change. Data from the first two years of continuous interviewing (2006-2008, n=13,495) were released in May 2010, followed by data from the full four years of interviews conducted in 2006-2010 (n=22,682). After awarding a new contract in 2010, Interviewing resumed in September 2011 and data files containing interviews from the two years from Sept 2011 through Sept 2013 (n=10,416) were released in December 2014. Interviewing continues at the rate of over 5,000 interviews per year. The next public use data file, which will contain interviews from Sept 2013 through Sept 2015 (projected n=-10,200), will be released in late 2016. Since its inception, the NSFG interviews have been conducted with respondents aged 15-44. Beginning in September 2015, the NSFG will also include men and women aged 45-49. This will enhance the substantive value of the survey and result in more efficient fieldwork."
"9516321","SUMMARY Normal development and healthy life are the result of the coordinated function of gene networks that appropriately adjust their equilibrium as needed. Functional genetic variation can shift network equilibrium and under unfavorable circumstances make networks fail, leading to disease. Most common functional genetic variants have small effects at the organism level, however our and others' data suggest that they may have much larger effects on isolated cells, in the absence of the organism's buffering defense mechanisms. In cells changes can be more striking, the most immediate change being in the cell's transcriptional output. The transcriptional signature of a functional variant reflects the specific networks it disrupts and when studied across many variants can help identify intervention targets. We propose to study 10 SZ associated loci and identify their common networks and candidate pharmacological interventions through the following specific aims: 1) We will choose loci where one or few experiments can confidently achieve targeting the functional variant. We will edit the genome of one male and one female induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSc) line to generate homozygotes for the risk and non-risk allele. These will be a resource for the next aims and for sharing with others. 2) We will differentiate the iPSc to cortical neurons and to astrocytes and compare the transcriptomes of the two homozygotes that are otherwise isogenic. We will perform 10 individual locus specific transcriptome analyses and compare results. 3) We will analyze all loci together to identify gene clusters that similarly change their expression in response to many modified loci. We will perform exploratory analyses that may offer insights in the involvement of these clusters in disease risk, the best candidate cluster for follow up and the specific relationship of each cluster to clinical presentation. We will then do a first screen for complementary drug signatures utilizing public resources and will follow this with verification of the complementarity for select compounds in neurons and astrocytes, test for rescue of the SZ variant induced changes and identify possible male-female differences. At the end of the project we will have created the first resource of modified iPS cells carrying functionally confirmed SZ-risk alleles. We will have identified gene clusters reflecting signatures of network disruptions shared by many SZ loci. We will have determined the specificity each cluster contributes to the disease phenotype and identified candidate pharmacological interventions for further testing."
"9260376","PROJECT 2 - ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECT 2 ? EP2 - PROJECT SUMMARY Abandoned uranium mines (AUM) situated on the tribal lands of the Navajo Nation and Laguna pueblo represent a major source of environmental contamination that threatens public health as a result of mobilization of toxic metals mixtures bearing uranium (U), vanadium (V), copper (Cu), arsenic (As). The transport of toxic metals mixtures into the air, and the potential for inhalational exposures, has never been investigated in a rigorous manner. The proposed research will investigate the potential exposure hazards to toxic metals mixtures resulting from inhalation of particulate matter (PM) derived from three different AUM sites located on Navajo Nation on Laguna Pueblo tribal lands in New Mexico and Arizona. The project will address the two specific aims: 1) Defining the physical, chemical and mineralogic profile of metals mixtures in AUM- impacted soils and assessing vulnerability to transport by wind; and 2) Developing a process model for the resuspension and transport of metal-bearing PM from AUM sites to estimate exposure risks for nearby vulnerable communities. For the process model, we will a) ascertain the particle size distributions and mineralogic characteristics of metal-bearing PM originating from AUM sites and the exposure potential to vulnerable populations living in the regional airshed under varied meteorological conditions; and b) conduct source-receptor modeling for the region, integrating information from three performance sites and deriving long-term estimates for Navajo community members. The proposed research will utilize state-of-the-art monitoring, chemical, imaging and atmospheric modeling techniques to provide a comprehensive dataset on the concentrations, speciation, valence, solubility, etc., of metals in different size fractions down to the nanoparticle scale that are essential to evaluate the potential toxicity and inhalation exposure risk for PM. The results will reduce uncertainty regarding the metal content, exposure concentrations, and sources of AUM- related PM exposures in risk reduction strategies."
"9261076","Project Summary Vibrio cholerae (Vc) is the causative agent of the severe diarrheal disease cholera, a disease that affects 3-5 million people each year. V. cholerae is a native to aquatic ecosystems; its worldwide disruption and epidemic capability makes V. cholerae a significant public health threat. Cholera is acquired by ingestion of Vc-contaminated food or water. Upon entering the gastrointestinal tract, V. cholerae responds to unknown in vivo environmental cues to activate expression of the ToxR regulon, a regulatory cascade that controls expression of genes that facilitate colonization and virulence factor production. Once established in the small intestine, Vc replicates to a high cell density before exiting the host in the diarrheal purge that is the hallmark of disease. This represents a significant dissemination event that contributes to epidemic spread of cholera. Phenotypic analysis has shown that the repression of the ToxR regulon occurs late in infection while genes that are important for dissemination and transmission are activated. The regulatory elements and signals that contribute to late infection phenotypes are unknown. Previous studies in our laboratory characterized the activity of a cyclic dipeptide metabolite, cFP, and showed that cFP inhibits virulence factor production by a ToxR-dependent mechanism. The function of ToxR in the establishment of Vc in the gastrointestinal tract has been well studied; however, the mechanism by which ToxR integrates environmental signals to modulate gene expression remains poorly understood. The finding that ToxR can function to repress virulence expression in response to environmental cues significantly expands the role of ToxR in Vc pathogenesis. This exemplifies the importance of delineating the mechanisms of ToxR signal transduction to gain to a better understanding of virulence regulation. ToxR is a one-component transcriptional activator that contains a cytoplasmic DNA-binding domain and a periplasmic domain proposed to function in signal sensing; these domains are linked by a transmembrane domain. Preliminary studies indicate that the periplasmic domain is required for ToxR-dependent gene induction in response to certain stimuli. Therefore, we hypothesize that ToxR functions to transduce signals by directly interacting with environmental cues via its periplasmic domain. Two aims are proposed to test this hypothesis. Aim 1 will define the role of the ToxR periplasmic domain (PPD) in environmental sensing. This includes characterizing the interaction between effector molecules and the PPD and identifying functional regions within the PPD that contribute to ToxR activity. Aim 2 will characterize the mechanism of ToxR-dependent transcription activation. Results from these studies will provide significant insight into ToxR signal transduction pathways. Furthermore, determining the mechanism of action of antivirulence compounds, like cyclic dipeptides, will contribute to the development of novel approaches to combat cholera."
"9315613","One goal of the UC Davis MIND Institute IDDRC is to more thoroughly address the biological complexity of  intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), such as fragile X syndrome (FXS) and autism spectrum  disorders (ASD). The overall objective of the Biological Analysis Core (BAC) is to facilitate an integrated  experimental approach to the study of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of neuronal and immune  function, including interactions between the two systems, in the context of IDD. This type of  comprehensive core does not currently exist at the MIND Institute or on the UC Davis campus. The BAC is  designed to advance and support research on emerging concepts regarding cellular and molecular  mechanisms contributing to the risk and clinical heterogeneity of conditions associated with IDD, including  variable response to therapy. Services provided will facilitate analyses of neuronal development, direct and  indirect interactions between the neuronal and immune systems, and cellular and molecular biology. The BAC  will also serve as a liaison to the vast array of resources at UC Davis for studying environmental exposures  and extend the core's assays and expertise to testing such exposure effects on immune and neuronal cells for  IDDRC projects. Recent achievements in these key areas by investigators included in the proposed IDDRC  can now provide the infrastructure needed to advance our understanding of the biologic underpinnings of FXS,  ASD, and other IDD conditions. This new core will be a unique resource for the MIND Institute IDDRC and the  entire IDDRC network.  The BAC is charged with providing core services that address components from each of the MIND  Institute IDDRC central themes: Integrated Biobehavioral Characterization of IDD, Environmental Contributions  to IDD, and Targeted Treatments for IDD. The BAC is designed to: 1) support the scientific agenda of the  IDDRC; 2) provide services and training related to analysis in the areas of cellular and molecular neurobiology  and Immunology; 3) increase access to cutting-edge resources in cellular and molecular neurobiology and  immunology that will enhance the research of IDDRC investigators; 4) work with each of the IDDRC cores to  support the integration and dissemination of services; and 5) work with the Administrative Core to integrate the  BAC into the broader context of the UC Davis IDDRC and the national network of NlCHD-funded IDDRCs.  The expertise of the BAC director, co-director, and core staff members includes extensive knowledge and  experience in immunology, molecular and cellular neurobiology and environmental toxicology in the area of  IDD. The key members of the BAC have previously worked together successfully to integrate seemingly  disparate disciplines to better understand the neurobiology of ASD. We will develop these successful  relationships into a state-of-the-art core to provide users with five tiers of service: 1) consultation in model  selection and experimental design; 2) training of users on available equipment; 3) training and supervision in  conducting assays of interest where applicable; 4) provision of a battery of assays conducted by core staff; and  5) tailored sets of analyses conducted by core staff. Combinations of service can be designed to match user  needs. Assistance with data interpretation will be provided as needed for each tier."
"9285997","Abstract Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), whole genome sequencing, and high-throughput techniques have generated vast amounts of diverse omics and phenotypic data. However, these sets of data have not yet been fully explored to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of drug discovery, which continues along the one- drug-one-gene paradigm. Consequently, the cost of bringing a drug to market is staggering, and the failure rate is daunting. Our long-term goal is to revive the lagging pharmaceutical pipeline by identifying robust methods for achieving precision medicine. We will achieve this goal by developing a novel structural systems pharmacology approach to drug discovery, which integrates structure-based drug design with heterogeneous omics data integration and analysis in the context of the whole human and pathogen genome and interactome. An increasing body of evidence from both our group and others suggests that most drugs commonly interact with multiple receptors (targets). Both strong and weak multiple drug-target interactions can collectively mediate drug efficacy, toxicity, and resistance through the conformational dynamics of biomolecules. In order to rationally design potent, safe, and precision medicine, we face one of the major unsolved challenges in structure-based drug design: what are all the possible proteins and their conformational states interacting with a drug in an organism? This proposal attempts to address this challenge by developing, disseminating, and experimentally testing novel computational tools. Based on our successful preliminary results, we will develop an integrated computational pipeline to identify three-dimensional (3D) protein-chemical interaction models in the cellular context and on a structural proteome scale. Specifically, we will develop a quaternary structure- centric multi-layered network model by integrating heterogeneous data from genomics, proteomics, and phenomics. We will develop a novel collaborative one-class collaborative filtering algorithm to infer missing relations in the multi-layered network. We will combine tools derived from structural bioinformatics, biophysics, and machine learning to gain biological insights into the drug action. To facilitate the usability and reproducibility of the proposed algorithms, we will develop community-based web resources established by our previous experiences in developing the Protein Data Bank (PDB). More importantly, we will work closely with experimental laboratories to test the proposed computational tools using targeted kinase polypharmacology as a real-world example, and iteratively improve the performance and usability of algorithm, software, and web services. The successful completion of this project will provide the scientific community with: (1) new methods to enhance the scope and capability of high-throughput screening for structure-based multi-target drug design; (2) a user-friendly web service to support community-based drug discovery; and (3) potential novel anti-cancer targeted therapeutics. Together, these tools will advance drug discovery and precision medicine by providing a structural systems pharmacology toolkit."

Responding to the staggering prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other chronic disease in Latinos living in the United States (US), and to the limited studies on the dietary habits and cultural beliefs that may contribute to those disparities, the research aims are to (1) to identify diet quality indices within Latino ethnic subgroups in the US and to evaluate associations of such indices with traditional and emerging CVD risk factors within ethnicity, (2) to contrast diet quality of Puerto Ricans in the mainland US versus the island, and assess how it is associated with long-term cardio-metabolic factors; and (3) to assess deep-cultural factors (core beliefs and influences) related to diet and disease and determine efficacy of a pilot intervention based on such components for Latino subgroups on improving diet quality. Analyses for the first two aims will be conducted using data from the national Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos, the Boston Puerto Rican Health Study, and the San Juan Obese Adult Longitudinal Study in Puerto Rico. Latino multiethnic adults will be recruited for the mixed-methods formative and pilot studies to be conducted at the South End Community Health Center in Boston, MA. To match the scope of the proposed scientific work, this proposal includes five career-development and training areas: (1) research expertise through the proposed aims, (2) coursework in advanced epidemiological methods, and behavioral and community intervention methods, (3) multiple career-building activities to acquire essential tools for leadership and professional growth, as well as dissemination and translation of findings, (4) continued mentoring and monitoring by an outstanding team of senior mentors and an advisory committee; and (5) a detailed plan to expand grant support and collaborations with various national institutions. This K01 project will compellingly impact public health by bridging the gap in knowledge of traditional diet quality of specific Latino groups and how these may shape racial and ethnic disparities in CVD risk factors. The work will provide preliminary data to support longitudinal studies on diet and disease, and full-scale community trials on improving diet quality to reduce disease burden among Latinos. The project builds upon exceptional resources and mentoring at the candidate's institution (Harvard School of Public Health) and partnering organizations, to train her in key new areas, bolster applications for competitive funding, disseminate findings among researchers and the wider community, augment faculty diversity, and attain research independence.

"9337499","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiometabolic syndrome (CMS) is known as the collective impact of type 2 diabetes (T2D), hypertension (HTN), and obesity, and is one of the biggest health challenges facing the world today. DNA methylation, the addition of a methyl group to cytosine or adenine nucleotides, varies with aging and with environmental exposures, and is a critical epigenetic mediator of gene expression. CMS has a variety of local and systemic manifestations, all of which are likely impacted by a combination of genetic, genomic, and epigenetic pathways. We hypothesize that characterization of gene-specific DNA methylation marks will provide important insights into the factors contributing to CMS. We also hypothesize that characterizing DNA methylation marks correlated with ABCG1, CPT1A, and TXNIP variants may provide important insights into the regulation of these key cardiometabolic genes, previously determined to be important in CMS. Thus, the broad goals of this project include three specific aims to be carried out in the San Antonio Family Heart Study (SAFHS) cohort of 600 Mexican Americans: 1) To determine the association of quantitative methylation data from ABCG1, CPT1A, and TXNIP at baseline with prevalent diabetes-, hypertension-, and obesity-related phenotypes; 2) To determine the association of quantitative methylation data from ABCG1, CPT1A, and TXNIP at baseline with progression to diabetes, hypertension, and obesity over four study visits; and 3) To integrate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variation, methylation marks, and gene expression data to define the most comprehensive causal model of CMS. The expected outcome of the proposed research and training is preliminary data to inform the design of a larger study led by the applicant to assess racial/ethnic variation in the epigenetics of CMS. In summary, this Mentored Career Development Award will foster the candidate's professional development as an independent scientist by providing an opportunity to gain expertise in epigenomics, health disparities, and statistical genetics.

"9338992","Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, is now reported to be circulating in 26 countries and territories in Latin America and the Caribbean. While infected individuals can often be asymptomatic or have only mild symptoms, emerging evidence starts to link ZIKV infection to fetal and newborn microcephaly and serious neurological complications, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome. The WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on Feb 1 of 2016. Though the structure, tropism and pathogenesis of ZIKV are largely unknown, several recent studies started to shed lights on the etiology of the virus. Indeed, recent studies published by Ming and colleagues demonstrated that ZIKV specifically infect human neuronal progenitor cells. The next important step is to elucidate the molecular mechanism of ZIKV-host interactions. It has been well documented that once a virus enters the host cell, it hijacks the cellular machineries, mainly via direct, physical contacts with host proteins. Therefore, construction of a ZIKV-host protein-protein interaction network will greatly facilitate our understanding of the molecular mechanism of ZIKV life cycle. In addition, comparison of the ZIKV- host interactions with dengue virus (DENV)-host interactions will provide us important clues to identify novel therapeutic targets. Specifically, we plan to: 1) Construct ZIKV and DENV-host protein-protein interaction networks; 2) Predict which host factor(s) plays an important role in ZIKV-host interactions; and 3) Validate newly identified ZIKV-host PPIs using cell-based approaches. The success of this project will provide us a global PPI network between ZIKV and human proteome. The comparison between ZIKV-host and DENV-host PPI networks will improve the likelihood for us to identify important host factors and/or pathways that are commonly exploited by the flavivirus. We believe that PPI datasets will serve as an important stepping stone towards identifying novel drug targets that will greatly facilitate development of novel therapeutics and vaccines."
"9540462","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this proposal is to develop a novel therapy - prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) - to mitigate the effects of radiation on the hematopoietic system. This robust cellular system is disrupted and damaged by exposure to radiation, which results in cytopenias leading to life-threatening infections, anemia, and bleeding. The onset and extent of platelet loss predicts survival following total body irradiation. The majority of agents that have been developed and stockpiled for use as part of a radiological emergency are specifically targeted at the clinical consequences of white blood cell loss. Although much work has been done over the past decades, few agents have transitioned from bench to clinic. The collaborative studies of the Palis and Calvi labs within the University of Rochester's Center for Medical Countermeasures against Radiation have resulted in the development of robust mouse models of acute and late radiation injury. Our preliminary studies indicate that PGE2, delivered 48-72 hours after acute radiation exposure, mitigates the megakaryocyte lineage leading to more rapid platelet recovery. In addition, PGE2 acutely mitigates the number of phenotypic HSC. We hypothesize that PGE2 acts through the marrow microenvironment, specifically at the level of endothelial cells and macrophage populations, to mitigate radiation-induced injury of hematopoietic stem cells and megakaryocyte precursors. We will assess the effectiveness and mechanism of PGE2 mitigation of acute and late hematologic injury. Our joint studies have also identified a special population - 14 day old mice - as being particularly sensitive to relatively lw sublethal radiation exposure, since they develop not only a severe reduction in phenotypic HSCs but also late peripheral cytopenias. A better understanding of the differential response between pediatric and adult populations, both to radiation injury and any proposed agents, will be required to develop treatments with broad applicability. We will, therefore, also investigate the efficacy of PGE2 to mitigate late injury to the hematopoietic system of pediatric versus adult populations. Taken together, our proposed collaborative, mechanistic studies will bring forward PGE2, a promising new agent with an established safety profile, for use in mitigating both acute and late effects of radiation exposure."
"9381090","Project Summary In an increasingly crowded and connected world, infectious diseases can spread rapidly between regions, as highlighted by increasingly frequent global pandemics including SARS, H1N1 influenza, Ebola virus, and now Zika virus. The spatial spread of disease mediated by human mobility also impacts endemic pathogens like malaria, where control programs and elimination strategies are undermined by travel to and from high transmission regions, drug resistant parasites are spread by human mobility, and distinguishing local from imported cases is critical for planning interventions. Understanding the distribution and dynamics of human populations underlies all aspects of infectious disease control, from the interpretation of surveillance data to the allocation of resources. Until recently, however, there was a glaring lack of information about human mobility patterns that spread diseases, particularly in low-income settings.  New sources of data on human mobility and the spatial spread of diseases are increasingly available. In particular, data from mobile phones provide passively collected, real-time information on the scale of millions of individuals, with operators routinely collecting data on the cell towers associated with calls/texts that ? when appropriately anonymized ? can be modeled to provide longitudinal maps of where people are and how they are moving. We have been developing approaches to these models into epidemiological frameworks for understanding the spatial spread of infections, showing that these approaches provide specific targets for malaria control, accurate predictions about the location and timing of dengue epidemics, and insights into seasonal peaks of rubella, for example. Sequencing technology is also producing large volumes of geocoded pathogen genomic data, which can be used to estimate gene flow between populations ? a measure of the rate at which infections are spreading. We have been analyzing malaria genetic data to adapt standard population genetic methods to accommodate the complex lifecycle and high diversity of the malaria parasite, in order to estimate this internal measure of migration.  This proposal brings together these sources of information about the spatial spread of infectious diseases, focusing on the spread of the malaria parasite in Southeast Asia, working with collaborators collecting parasite genomic data in the region, mobile operators, and National Malaria Control Programs, to develop practical mathematical tools for integrating mobility data and pathogen genomics into the risk mapping, drug resistance monitoring, and resource allocation protocols used by control programs when planning for elimination. The project will lead to an analytical pipeline for generating mobility models from mobile phone data that can also be applied to other infectious diseases, and in particular in response to emerging epidemics. New tools are needed to understand the interaction between human population dynamics and the spread of infectious disease threats. These data sets are now increasingly straightforward to generate, but the analytical tools available to make the most use of them are still lacking. This proposal aims to develop the approaches to translate the promise of ?Big Data? into insights that can be used by policy makers to control and contain human pathogens."
"9359535","Abstract This competitive renewal seeks funding for years 11-15 of a successful institutional training grant focusing on the science of organ and tissue transplantation. The Advanced Research Training in Transplantation Sciences (ARTTS) program at Emory University serves an area of medical science, transplantation biology, that is exceptionally rigorous, uniquely multidisciplinary, and in dire need of new students to take up the substantial momentum established in the past 20 years. The application seeks to fund 1 pre-doctoral and 2 post-doctoral trainees each year, and individual appointments will last for 2 years. It seeks to produce trainees that go on to establish independent research programs in the area of transplantation biology. Since its inception in 2006, the program has successfully recruited and trained 6 pre-doctoral trainees and 9 post-doctoral trainees. Of the 6 pre-doctoral ARTTS trainees who have completed training, 100% had a first author publication as a result of their graduate research, and the average numbers of first author and total publications for this group was 2.67 (range 1-4) and 5.17 (range 1-9), respectively. Of the 6 past post-doctoral ARTTS trainees who have completed training, 100% had a first author publication as a result of their post-doctoral research, and the average numbers of first author and total publications for this group was 1.9 (range 1-6) and 4.3 (range 2-8), respectively. Furthermore, 93.3% of ARTTS Program trainees are in research-intensive careers or are still in training. Thus, the program has been highly successful in recruiting and training the next generation of transplantation scientists. The current proposal represents the continued commitment of a team of highly productive, diverse, and actively collaborating junior and senior investigator/mentors, with an associated group of dedicated instructors, on a strong institutional foundation of fundamental academic excellence, to execute a unique and carefully designed training program that will continue to attract and retain highly motivated trainees to the transplantation field, and give them the unique tool set needed to influence the prevailing problems in the field. In the current application we propose to further enhance communication and collaboration between basic, translational, and clinical transplantation sciences by offering formal training in clinical and translational science analytics, bioinformatics, and clinical trial design. The ARTTS Program thus now offers an incredibly rich environment spanning powerful murine models in transplantation and viral immunology, an intensive translational program at the Yerkes National Primate Center, and markedly augmented opportunities in clinical trials and human immunology. The program continues to evolve to better attract highly qualified candidates from across the country representing a diversity of races and ethnicities, and importantly now offers a research focus on health disparities among minority groups in transplantation. Thus, the current offering is on the cutting edge of training in transplantation sciences, and undoubtedly will contribute to improving the future of transplantation research and practice, and optimizing both length and quality of life for transplant recipients."
"9363867","An estimated more than ninety-five percent of potential Alzheimer's Disease (AD) therapeutics and prophylactics have extremely limited ability to migrate from circulation to brain tissue. These transport limitations necessitate unfeasibly high doses of systemically administered drug to realize beneficial effects in the brain and/or promote off-target side effects throughout the body. A generalizable delivery technology that both targets transport-impaired drugs to and facilitates transport of these drugs across the blood brain barrier (BBB) would dramatically expand the armamentarium of agents for AD therapy and prophylaxis and could transform the way clinicians seek to treat and prevent AD by providing the breadth of pharmaceutical options needed to enable development of personalized AD treatment and prevention programs. `Trojan Horse' antibodies (Abs) that bind to proteins on and are transported across the BBB have been heavily pursued in central nervous system (CNS) drug targeting. Proteins bound by Trojan Horse Abs however, appear on both the BBB and other tissues throughout the body; less than one percent of systemically injected Trojan Horse Ab-drug conjugates reach the brain. We will realize step change improvements upon existing Trojan Horse Ab technologies by simultaneously identifying proteins and/or epitopes specific to or highly enriched on brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) and generating human fibronectin domains (Fn3s), proteins that can possess Ab-like target binding affinity and specificity but are less time consuming and expensive than Abs to produce, that bind these BBB-specific molecular entities. Our innovative process for converting BMECs into water soluble nanometer-sized vesicles, known as CytoBits, uniquely positions us to succeed where others have encountered difficulties in engineering highly specific BBB-binding drug carrier proteins. Unlike whole cells, CytoBits are compatible with magnetic microsphere- and multicolor fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS)-based methods that will enable us to screen a 250 million clone yeast-displayed Fn3 library and separate BMEC-binding clones from Fn3s that bind to cells derived from nontarget, e.g., lung and cardiac, tissues with fidelity that cannot be approached by the cell panning methods used in others' drug carrier protein development efforts. Leading candidate BBB-specific drug carrier Fn3s enriched via yeast-displayed Fn3 library screening will be expressed as soluble proteins and their affinities and specificities toward intact BMECs quantified via flow cytometry. Combining binding assay outcomes, measured rates of Fn3 endocytosis by BMECs, and utilization of tandem mass spectrometry to elucidate identities of BMEC proteins immunoprecipitated by drug carrier Fn3s will yield a dataset that will guide our choosing up to three BBB-specific Fn3s for mouse biodistribution studies carried out subsequent to this two-year project. Our long-term objective for this CNS drug targeting research initiative is to see BBB-specific drug carrier Fn3s broadly deployed in personalized AD drug programs by the year 2030; our team possesses both the animal study expertise and clinical connections needed to realize this timetable for translation. We are eager to continue our progress toward achieving this goal and are excited about the impact that its realization will have in making a difference for the millions of AD patients, friends, and family members whose lives have been tragically rearranged by this debilitating condition."
"9358703","This goal of this application is to establish a clinical center at Wake Forest University Health Sciences in the  MACH14 trial. The effects of drinking alcohol within recommended limits on risks of CVD, diabetes, and  related diseases are perhaps the most important questions yet to be answered in the fields of alcohol, nutrition,  or prevention. Epidemiological studies have consistently found that alcohol intake within recommended limits  is associated with lower risk of coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and diabetes, yet no long-term  randomized trial of alcohol consumption on risk of any chronic disease has yet been performed. In direct  response to PAR-16-363 (Multi-Site Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial Research Center on Alcohol's Health  Effects), we propose a worldwide, six-year, balanced-design randomized trial, comparing the effects of one  standard serving (~14 grams) of alcohol intake daily to abstention on risk of CVD, diabetes, mortality, and  related outcomes among 7,800 adults at above-average cardiovascular risk worldwide. To maximize feasibility  and reflect actual use most closely, we propose to test alcohol consumption per se to abstention and thus to  offer participants flexibility in their choice of beverage, while employing novel and intensive yet efficient  methods to monitor safety. The Primary Specific Aim of this trial is to determine the effects of 14 gm of alcohol  intake daily compared with abstention on risk of major cardiovascular events or death (myocardial infarction,  ischemic stroke, hospitalized angina, need for revascularization, or death) over an average of 6 years of follow-  up among 7,800 adults aged ?50 years with estimated 10-year CVD risk ?15% or prevalent CVD >6 months  prior to enrollment. Secondary Aims will test the effects of alcohol on risks of incident diabetes and major  cardiovascular events. Tertiary Aims will test risks of hard cardiovascular events and progression to impaired  fasting glucose. Similar to other large randomized trials, we will establish ~16 centers worldwide using a  stepped approach, with a 9-month vanguard phase among 7 centers in the US, Europe, Africa, and South  America (in this application), followed by a second wave of additional sites to complete enrollment.  Participants will be monitored for safety in multiple complementary ways, including brief electronic real-time  reporting and validated yearly instruments and laboratory measures. We have brought together highly  successful groups in the US and Europe to establish clinical, data, and biospecimen coordinating centers, our  field centers include many of the most experienced clinical trialists anywhere, and our group has strong  working relationships with NIAAA and other NIH staff necessary to ensure seamless collaboration during a  U10-funded cooperative research endeavor. In this application, we propose the first randomized clinical trial of  alcohol consumption, aiming to determine whether it increases or decreases the risk of CVD and diabetes  among adults at above-average cardiovascular risk worldwide."
"9316581","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a critical public health need for the development of anti-cancer chemotherapeutics which selectively target cancerous versus non-cancerous tissues. The RNA-binding protein Insulin-like Growth Factor 2 Binding Protein 1 (IGF2BP1/IMP-1/CRD-BP) represents a novel and selective anti- cancer target because it exhibits an oncofetal pattern of expression-it is virtually absent or undetectable in normal adult tissues, overexpressed in many types of human cancers, and absent in non-cancerous adult tissue. IMP-1 binds to and stabilizes mRNAs encoding oncogenes, c-Myc, K- Ras, ERK and multidrug resistance factor 1 (MDR1) and increases activity of the tumor enabling factor NF-?B. IMP-1 expression is associated with a poor prognosis and reduced survival in several cancers including lung, colon, and ovarian cancer. Transgenic mice with targeted expression of IMP- 1 develop mammary tumors and colorectal tumor growth, further implicating this RNA-binding protein in the development of cancer. Despite its importance in cancer, small molecule inhibitors of IMP-1 do not exist and regulation of this protein is poorly understood. The central hypotheses of the proposed research, which have been formulated based on a strong body of preliminary results is that IMP-1 is a novel molecular link between tumor-enabling inflammation and cancer and a novel therapeutic target at the convergence of these disease processes. We will address these hypotheses through the following Specific Aims: 1) Test the hypothesis that IMP-1 increases NF-?B activity and NF-?B induces IMP-1, establishing a feed- forward regulatory loop, increasing inflammation and 2) Evaluate the ability of Compound 389 to inhibit tumor growth and/or induce tumor regression in IMP-1+ mouse xenograft models and determine specificity and toxicity of the lead small molecule. Previous research has shown that IMP- 1 acts indirectly, increasing NF-?B activity and preliminary data shows that the IMP-1 promoter region contains multiple NF-?B binding sites. I will test the hypothesis that IMP-1 establishes a feed-forward regulatory loop promoting inflammation in which IMP-1 increases NF-?B activity, and NF-?B acts as a transcriptional regulator to induce IMP-1 (Aim 1). My recently identified small molecule inhibitors of IMP-1 will be important probes used to help evaluate the importance of these regulatory pathways in the proliferation and inflammation of cancer cells. The lead IMP-1 inhibitor will be evaluated in mouse xenograft models for melanoma and ovarian cancer (Aim 2). The proposed research is significant because it will greatly advance knowledge on the regulation of IMP-1 and the development of a novel, first-in class IMP-1 small molecule inhibitor, which has strong therapeutic potential in the targeted and selective treatment of IMP-1+ cancers."
"9214728","Project Summary Mitochondrial diseases comprise a heterogeneous group of genetic inherited disorders resulting from mutations in mitochondrial or nuclear DNA that cause failures in mitochondrial energetic and metabolic function. As a consequence of this mitochondrial failure, high energy demanding tissues such as brain, skeletal muscle, liver, kidney, endocrine and respiratory systems are severely affected. Current available therapies remain supportive but an effective cure is still missing. Therefore, there is an urgent medical need to identify new therapeutic targets to treat mitochondrial diseases. Identification of specific targets and drugs that increase and rescue mitochondrial bioenergetics through different complexes of the electron transport chain can be of therapeutic value to treat mitochondrial diseases. An example is activation of the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1?, a major component of mitochondrial biogenesis, that rescue bioenergetic defects caused by mutations or mouse models of mitochondrial diseases and ameliorates clinical symptoms. Using a chemical and genome-wide CRISPR editing screens in trans-mitochondrial cybrids cell carrying a mutation in a mitochondrial encoded complex I subunit, we have identified Brd4 (Bromodomain protein 4) as potential target to treat mitochondrial diseases. Bromodomain inhibition or loss-of-Brd4 enhances oxidative phosphorylation activity and rescues the bioenergetic defects caused by genetic inhibition of mitochondrial complex I and promotes cell survival under high energetic demands. However, the precise mechanisms of how bromodomain inhibition controls mitochondrial bioenergetics and the effects on mitochondrial disease in in vivo models are unknown. The major goal of this grant application is to identify and analyze the molecular mechanisms whereby bromodomain inhibition activates mitochondrial energetics function and whether it rescues mitochondrial disease symptoms in in vivo mouse models. The research strategy is focused on three central aims: 1) Molecular and functional analysis of how Brd4 controls mitochondrial gene expression programs in trans-mitochondrial cybrid cells. (Specific Aim 1), 2) Cellular, metabolic and bioenergetic analysis mediated by bromodomain inhibition in cybrid cell lines and mitochondrial disease patient derived fibroblasts (Specific Aim 2) and, 3) In vivo and Ex vivo metabolic, energetic and survival analysis by bromodomain inhibitors in mitochondrial disease mouse models (Specific Aim 3). The outcomes from these studies will identify novel molecular mechanisms and regulatory components by which bromodomain inhibition and loss of Brd4 rescue bioenergetic defects caused by mitochondrial electron transfer chain defects. Since mitochondrial bioenergetic failure is a hallmark of mitochondrial diseases, our studies may translate into potential therapies."

Vanderbilt?s IDDRC includes the  full range of basic, clinical, and intervention scientists necessary to fulfill the goals for the EKS NICHD IDDRC  program of translational research that improves the lives of people with intellectual and developmental  disabilities (IDD) and their families. Our IDDRC focuses on elucidating mechanisms and effective interventions  for individuals with autism spectrum disorders, learning disabilities, genetic IDD syndromes, and  acquired IDDs. Within each of these groups, IDDRC investigators discover underlying disease mechanisms,  treatment targets, and aberrant developmental processes in model systems; assess cognitive, social,  emotional, and neural phenotypes; and conduct innovative treatment and intervention studies. These activities  are embodied in the U54 Research Project, Sensory and Multisensory Contributions to Autism, which meets  the EKS NICHD Focus Theme #2: Outcome Measures for Interventions, and highlights an understudied but  increasingly recognized characteristic of autism. Vanderbilt?s U54 IDDRC includes 46 investigators from 15  academic departments who lead 69 research projects; 14 are funded by the EKS NICHD. We propose  five exceptional, non-duplicative IDDRC Cores to support these investigators and that are also integrated into  each Specific Aim of the U54 Research Project. The Administrative Core A provides scientific direction,  manages IDDRC governance committees and activities, and leads innovative training and educational  programs. Clinical Translational Core B meets investigators? immediate needs for recruiting and phenotyping  participants with IDDs, while also assisting with clinical trials, mining novel epidemiological data for IDD  phenotyping, and building a new resource of IDD outcome measures. Translational Neuroimaging Core C  assists investigators with neuroimaging and psychophysiology data acquisition, processing, and analyses;  creates novel experimental paradigms, and proposes ?big data? approaches for large-scale investigations of  IDD. Neuroscience Core D provides essential and inherently generative services in mouse neurobehavioral  phenotyping, neurochemistry, molecular neurobiology and genomics, and scientific instrumentation, which  designs, constructs, or repairs specialized research equipment. Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core E  improves research quality with expert biostatistical consultation and training on topics that are relevant to IDDs,  and also develops unique bioinformatics databases of electronic medical record data from patients with IDDs  that are linked to their DNA. IDDRC Cores are thus customized to meet the immediate needs of our  investigators, and also to generate novel, forward-thinking technologies, tools, or resources that drive  innovative discoveries aimed at understanding and ameliorating IDDs."

"9315563","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Cancer is the cause of 1 in 4 deaths in the US and is the leading cause of disease-related death in children.1 Even with the most current standard of therapy including surgical removal of the tumor, chemotherapy, and irradiation therapy, pediatric and adolescent sarcomas remain a significant challenge with 1 in 3 patients developing relapsed or metastatic tumors that are incurable.2 One promising strategy to combat these aggressive tumors is the use of oncolytic herpes simplex viruses (oHSVs) that are genetically engineered to selectively replicate in cancer cells and destroy the tumors using the virus's natural replication cycle.4-6 However, patient response to oHSV therapy varies greatly in clinical trials, with some patients achieving dramatic cures while the majority of patients having no improvement with oHSV therapy.7 It is unclear what determines individual patient response, but there are likely microenvironment factors that differ between patients. It has been assumed in the research community that oncolytic virus efficacy is dependent on the direct lytic effect of virus replication in the tumor cells.4-6 However, our sarcoma models are discordant with this dogma between oHSV replication and anti-tumor efficacy. It is known that classically activated M1 macrophages produce reactive oxygen species that are cytotoxic to the tumor, while alternatively activated M2 macrophages secrete growth factors and immunosuppressive signals that promote tumor growth.8, 10, 15-17 However, the effect of M1/M2 macrophage subtypes on oncolytic virus efficacy against sarcoma tumors is unknown. The objective of this study is to test our hypothesis that M2 tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) diminish oHSV anti-tumor efficacy and modulation of macrophage polarization improves oHSV therapy. To determine if TAMs are responsible for sarcoma resistance against oHSV, sarcoma tumor bearing mice treated with or without macrophage depleting liposomal clodronate will be evaluated for oHSV anti-tumor efficacy by measuring tumor progression, virus replication, vasculature staining, and immune cell infiltration. Then the extent of TAM polarization on tumor resistance to oHSV by coculturing unstimulated M0 or cytokine activated M1 and M2 macrophages with sarcoma cells and measuring oHSV cytotoxicity, virus replication, cytokine secretion, and changes in macrophage polarization. Finally, trabectedin chemotherapeutic will be used to deplete M2 macrophages and test for improvement in oHSV anti-tumor efficacy will be evaluated as described above along with quantification of M1/M2 tumor infiltrating macrophage populations. Understanding the role of the individual M1/M2 macrophage subtypes in oHSV resistance will lead to refined therapies that selectively target the tumor associated macrophage subtype that causes oHSV resistance, our studies may also result in the identification of biomarkers that predict oHSV efficacy in individual cancer patients."
"9236003","ABSTRACT Adolescence is a critical developmental time period in which experimentation with marijuana is common. Marijuana use in adolescence is associated with negative health consequences including effects on cognitive development and increased injury risks. The legalization of adult recreational marijuana use will affect adolescents even though there are legal limitations on their ability to purchase marijuana in stores. Teens are now exposed to recreational marijuana promotions through social media such as Facebook and Twitter, and traditional advertisements (ads) such as billboards along major roadways. Previous research on tobacco and alcohol illustrate that advertising contributes to adolescents? initiation of these substances. Marijuana promotions present several new public health challenges such as focused efforts in the social media space, which include providing messages linking marijuana to positive health outcomes and influencing norms around marijuana use. At present, critical unanswered questions include: 1) the reach of marijuana promotions and ads to adolescents in a state where recreational marijuana is legal, 2) strategies that marijuana promotions and ads use to influence consumers and target youth, and 3) how adolescents interpret these marijuana promotions and ads. Now is a critical time to understand marijuana promotions and ads while policies that regulate them are nascent or emerging. Our over-arching goal is to address these critical gaps in the literature towards informing theory, policy and future interventions. This proposal includes three linked aims towards this goal. Our conceptual approach will be the Theory of Normative Social Behavior (TNSB) which supports the role of injunctive norms in predicting behavior. Aim 1: We will conduct a cross-sectional survey of adolescents in the Seattle metro area (n=500) to determine the local reach of marijuana promotions and ads in a state where recreational marijuana is legalized. We will determine risk factors for exposure to marijuana promotions and ads, and investigate associations between marijuana promotion/ad exposure and intention to use marijuana mediated by TNSB constructs. Aim 2: We will conduct a content analysis of one year of recreational marijuana promotions on social media (estimated 20,000 posts) and ads including billboard and print applying TNSB constructs. Aim 3: We will work with adolescents (n=160) as stakeholders to develop a concept map representing key concepts in how marijuana promotions and ads exert influence. We will determine how the concepts in this stakeholder-driven concept map are similar or different to those represented in tobacco and alcohol ads, and compare these key influential concepts to those in existing health behavior theory such as TNSB. This proposal is consistent with the research goals outlined in PAS-14-020: Public Health Impact of the Changing Policy/Legal Environment for Marijuana. Our study team includes investigators with expertise in social media, adolescent health, advertisements and marijuana.

The CHARGE (Childhood Autism Risks from Genetics and Environment) Study is a large, population-based case-control investigation of environmental risk factors, broadly defined, in relation to ASD and developmental delay without ASD symptoms, with referents from the general population. Fieldwork began in 2003, and by now CHARGE has published widely on exposures such as air pollution, mercury, flame retardants, maternal nutritional status in the peri-conception, untreated fever during pregnancy, mitochondrial dysfunction, candidate genes, a wide array of functional immune markers in both the child and the mother, and maternal metabolic conditions including obesity and diabetes. This last finding is notable, given the epidemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes that has occurred in parallel with the steady rise in ASD over the last few decades. Moreover, an emerging literature implicates several endocrine disrupting chemicals as contributing to obesity and metabolic dysregulation, including hyperinsulinemia, and to neurodevelopmental disorders as well. This project therefore builds upon these observations in several ways.  First, obesity and type 2 or gestational diabetes will be examined in a larger sample, and glucose challenge test (GCT) results for the first time, to determine associations not only with development of ASD and intellectual impairment in the children, but also with specific speech and language delays, behavioral phenotypes such as attention deficits or hyperactivity, and gene expression. Second, these maternal metabolic conditions will be evaluated for associations with markers of both metabolic and immune dysregulation to be measured in neonatal bloodspots. Third, the predictive value of neonatal bloodspot markers for a later diagnosis of ASD or other child developmental and behavioral outcomes will be assessed. Fourth, the maternal metabolic conditions will be analyzed for potential links with upstream exposures to phthalates and anti- bacterial compounds, ubiquitous chemicals in common household products. Finally, this project will examine how gene variants that play a role in biochemical pathways relevant to the processes under study may influence susceptibility of the mother, the neonate or the child. To ensure adequate power for this analysis of gene-environment interaction, the sample size will be increased to 2400 children. This project addresses several goals set by the NIH Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee: 1) to discover environmental factors contributing to ASD, particularly in the prenatal period, 2) to understand biological mechanisms for ASD risk, including gene-by-environment interactions, and 3) to identify children at risk for ASD at earlier time points. Results of this detailed inquir into early exposures, maternal pathophysiology and prognostic markers in the newborn will set the stage for developing prevention strategies."
"9209605","Abstract: The HCTB Core will assist PJIs with the application of their promising research to the field of clinical viral oncology through prioritization of clinical data and biospecimen collection for PJIs in the Center for Translational Viral Oncology (CTVO). The CTVO will support personnel in the Core who will provide services to the PJIs at no cost. This unique HIV/Clinical Tumor Biorepository (HCTB) organized and directed by Dr. Parsons collects biospecimens from the HIV/AIDS Malignancy Program and from other oncology clinics that evaluate, diagnose and treat patients with viral associated malignancies. These patients have a disproportionate representation of minorities, mostly African American. Our overarching goal is to assist PJIs with performance of high-quality translational research utilizing linked biospecimens and clinical data from patients receiving care at the University Medical Center ? New Orleans - Infectious Diseases Center (UMCNO- IDC) and its affiliated partners (HIV/AIDS Malignancy Program and others). Use of these samples will inform and ensure clinical relevance for their mechanistic studies and promote clinical translation of their work. Through this effort, we seek in the future to improve health outcomes for underserved HIV+ patients at risk for virus-associated cancers. In addition access to these unique samples should provide successful PJI's with a competitive edge as they apply for independent grant funding. The HCTB Core will support the translational research proposed by PJIs in the CTVO through the following Specific Aims: 1) To assist PJIs with IRB applications and design of translational studies; 2) To expand an integrated, clinic-based system for collection of linked clinical data and biospecimens from HIV+ patients in New Orleans who are at high risk for virus- associated cancers; 3) To ensure storage of high-quality HIV+ biospecimens for easy access by PJIs; and 4) To perform timely shipment of HIV+ biospecimens to external collaborators for PJIs."
"9369943","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The long-term goal of this proposal is to establish successful independent laboratory using mouse models to study the neurobiology and treatment of Smith-Magenis Syndrome (SMS), a devastating neurodevelopmental disorder caused by haploinsufficiency of RAI1. SMS patients exhibit prominent neurologic symptoms, including intellectual disabilities, sleep disturbances, seizures, hypotonia, self-injurious behaviors, and autistic features. We recently discovered that Rai1 is a transcription factor that promotes the expression of several genes important for neuronal morphogenesis and neurotransmission. However, the mechanism by which Rai1 regulates neuronal morphology and activity, thereby causing the neurobehavioral symptoms is unclear. Furthermore, we also lack fundamental understanding about when during development is RAI1 required for neural functions, and whether SMS symptoms are reversible if RAI1 dosage is restored in adults. The objectives of this proposal are to (1) determine critical temporal windows for Rai1 requirement and correct SMS-like phenotypes; (2) determine the role of Rai1 in neuronal morphogenesis; and (3) determine how loss of Rai1 shapes neuronal activity. The central hypothesis is that Rai1 regulates the morphogenesis and circuit activity homeostasis. Restoring Rai1 in critical temporal windows will ameliorate at least some SMS-like phenotypes in mice. This hypothesis will be tested using cutting-edge neuroscience techniques in combination with novel mouse genetic tools. Completion of the proposed experiments will determine the reversibility of various neurobehavioral and physiological phenotypes of SMS, identify the critical treatment window, and elucidate the anatomical and activity level deficits underlying SMS symptoms. These results will serve as the foundation for future studies aimed to reverse these deficits. The mentored phase of this award will be overseen by a team of world renowned neuroscientists including Drs. Liqun Luo, John Huguenard, Mehrdad Shamloo, and John Swann. Upon completion of the mentored phase that focuses on studying the role of Rai1 in neuronal morphology and activity, the PI will be able to link the molecular functions of Rai1 to its behavioral functions. A comprehensive training plan was proposed to include additional education in single cell dendritic morphological analysis and electrophysiological recordings. Completion of this proposal will provide the necessary skills to transition to an independent faculty position at a top research institution."
"9330129","Project Summary Waterpipe (WP) tobacco smoking has surpassed cigarette smoking and now rivals the electronic cigarette as the most popular tobacco product class in the US among youth. This may be due to the availability of sweet, fruit- and candy-flavored tobaccos that make inhaling tobacco smoke more appealing. It is not clear what is most important in terms of increasing appeal: the smoker's perception of sweetness, or flavor, or both. WP tobacco is unique because of the amounts and identities of its additives and the way that it is smoked. The flavorings and high levels of sweet humectants produce harmful and potentially harmful constituents in the smoke, and are thought to contribute to the direct and indirect harm experienced by users. To define the effects of specific chemical content with respect to sweet perception and likability among users, WP tobacco that differs only in the variables of interest must be used. There is no set of commercially available tobacco brands for which this is true, and thus we propose to manipulate commercial products to properly isolate the important variables. There is an existing data gap surrounding the influence of WP tobacco additives, i.e., sweet humectants and flavorings, on the addictiveness, toxicity, flavor perceptions and appeal of WP smoking. The proposed study uses a crossover human trial, a manipulated WP tobacco prodcut, a validated research grade waterpipe and cutting edge analytical chemistry and psychosocial instruments to systematically investigate the effects of sweet humectant concentration and flavorings on the appeal, puffing behavior, and toxicity of WP tobacco smoking. The purpose of the proposed study is to acquire sound scientific data to inform the development of possible regulatory actions such as identifying and establishing evidenced-based product standards, or maximum thresholds of additives in WP tobacco that must not be exceeded in order for the product to be sold and distributed in the US. This study will address RFA-OD-15-005 questions 3 and 4 by quantifying the impact of WP tobacco additives, such as humectants and flavorants, on human puffing behaviors and HPHC levels in mainstream WP tobacco smoke to address these important data gaps."
"9319522","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) (http://www.alz.washington.edu) was begun in 1999 to facilitate collaborative research among the Alzheimer's Disease Centers funded independently by NIA as the Alzheimer's Disease Centers Program since 1984. During the initial phase of its development, NACC collected a minimal data set (MDS) of clinical data on the subjects who had been enrolled at ADCs since 1984. Then in 2005, through close collaboration with NIA and the ADC Clinical Task Force, a detailed clinical evaluation and data-collection system was implemented called the Uniform Data Set (UDS); its protocol required annual follow-up examinations to monitor change over time in the patients and normal controls. About 66,000 persons were included in the MDS and 29,000 so far in the UDS (some with up to seven annual follow-up visits). From the MDS and UDS there is a total of about 13,000 persons who have died and had an autopsy to determine pathologic basis for their condition. All of these data have been collected by NACC and are housed in the NACC database. The data are freely available to researchers on request. There have been 306 publications within the 2009 - 14 grant cycle. NACC develops the clinical forms and documentation for all the data collection, working closely with the ADC CTF and with each Center. We have become an integral part of the ADC Program, not only to collect enrollment data and monitor ADC progress, but also to provide a large and unparalleled research database to the scientific community. We are now applying to continue NACC's efforts for another five years. During that time we will: a.) Maintain and increase the research capability of the NACC database by adding refined diagnostic data and, as it is  approved by the CTF and NIA, disease specific modules as well as imaging and other biomarker data. We have maintained high data quality standards over the years and will continue to do so, through a detailed system of database error checks and communication with the Centers. b.) Facilitate and conduct research using NACC data by providing data and consultation to investigators; providing competitive peer-reviewed funding to several projects per year; and conducting internal applied and theoretical research. c.) Collaborate with national and international efforts on AD and other dementias, such as the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium, and make the UDS and other instruments available to non-ADC researchers anywhere in the world. d.) Continue the NIA-required administrative coordination of ADC meetings and ADC communications."
"9368629","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Migraine affects 12% of the world population, and is one of the leading causes of disability worldide. Yet surprisingly little is known about the basic features of this disease. One of the major questions in migraine is how its quintessential feature, the migraine attack, is generated. For approximately a third of migraineurs, the pain of the attack is preceded by an aura, typically a sensory hallucination. Unlike the attack, the aura is physiologially measurable, in humans and in animal model systems, because its physiological correlate is a massive depolarization called cortical spreading depression (CSD). By understanding how CSD is generated, we can understand how the attack begins. Our three aims address the origins of the migraine attack from different angles. The first aim builds on our work showing that CSD, like the aura, has a predilection for sensory cortex. We ask why this predilection exists, with the expectation that understanding the mechanisms will yield insights as to how the aura, and thus the attack, are generated. We use a combination of imaging, electrophysiology and transporter expression analysis to examine the reuptake of extracellular potassium and glutamate, with the hypothesis that barrel cortex may exhibit a relative deficiency in reuptake compared to other regions. The second aim tests the hypothesis that failure or saturation of astrocytic reuptake mechanisms underlies CSD ignition. Our preliminary data on CSD propagation shows astrocyte activation well in advance of the wave, and suggests a failure of potassium reuptake at the advancing wavefront. We will genetically ablate key astrocyte mediators of potassium reuptake as the cortex is brought to CSD threshold in vivo, in order to test the role of the astrocyte, and determine which mechanism is most important. The third aim asks how CSD, a massive depolarization, is generated in an ostensibly intact brain. Here our preliminary data on sensory cortex susceptibility is particularly important, as it allows us to constrain potentially open-ended experiments. We will systematically test triggers of aura in awake behaving animals while we record from sensory cortex using two photon microscopy."
"9314857","Project Summary/Abstract:  The rising opioid misuse epidemic has intensified efforts to implement cost-effective strategies to expand access to office-based opioid treatment (OBOT). Office-based buprenorphine treatment with elements of patient education, individualized evidence-based care plans, and expert care availability offers a patient- centered approach to reduce the burden of opioid addiction and related comorbidities. OBOT, however, remains underutilized in traditional healthcare settings, and barriers to expansion includes limited clinical and administrative support, particularly during induction and stabilization. Text messaging (TM) offers a low-cost and personalized approach to enhancing buprenorphine treatment in primary care and may address logistical and clinical challenges previously reported by buprenorphine providers. This project investigates the feasibility and clinical impact of a TM intervention to improve adherence to Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and consensus guidelines to office-based buprenorphine treatment (e.g., adherence to buprenorphine, patient-provider communication, and self-management).  The project will develop and conduct preliminary tests of a TM intervention that will improve adherence to buprenorphine treatment, patient-provider communication, and self-management following induction in two phases: 1) identifying key stakeholders (e.g., patients, physicians, and administrators) who will inform the design and delivery of the TM intervention, and 2) assessing the feasibility and clinical impact of this intervention during the first 3 months following induction to buprenorphine. Qualitative and mixed- methods research will explore key stakeholder preferences to intervention design using the Technology Acceptance Model. The TM intervention prototype will undergo usability testing to fine-tune intervention components among patients entering OBOT for induction to buprenorphine. The feasibility and clinical impact of a refined intervention prototype will then be assessed in a pilot randomized controlled trial and identify modifications to optimize the intervention for a future efficacy trial.  TM is the most popular mobile phone feature nationally, among patients in addiction treatment, and in OBOT. This low-cost clinical support tool is uniquely positioned to accelerate DHHS and NIDA goals to expand access to substance abuse treatment in traditional healthcare settings. Findings from this project will lead to the development of a patient-centered platform that will: 1) enhance patient-provider communication and solve patient challenges to chronic disease management in primary care including transportation and limited in-person visit slots; 2) improve adherence to buprenorphine treatment by receiving medication reminders; 3) promote self-management through instructions regarding self-administration of comfort medications to quell mild withdrawal symptoms, linkage with psychosocial support, and 12-step group meetings; and 4) integrate with electronic health records and larger-scale adoption in primary care settings nationally."
"9322320","ABSTRACT Renal and hepatic cysts along with fibrosis (Hepatorenal Fibrocystic Disease, HRFD) are phenotypes observed in a large number of human syndromes (PKD, MKS, NPHP, JBTS, and BBS), the most prevalent of which is PKD. Unfortunately, current treatments for HRFDs are largely palliative and new more efficacious strategies are needed to retard or reverse cyst progression. Animal models that develop HRFDs have been instrumental in advancing our understanding of the molecular and cellular basis of these disorders and also serve as preclinical platforms to test candidate therapeutic and means of intervention. One key theme derived from these models is that most mutations causing HRFDs occur in genes that encode cilia proteins or proteins that are required for cilia assembly or function. While animal models of HRFDs are essential tools for advancing the field, there are many hurdles that prevent their full utilization in many labs. This includes the expertise, cost, and effort required to set up and generate the models and their ready availability. It can often take a year to establish new models at an investigator's home institution, which is prohibitive for rapid testing of novel hypotheses. To help reduce these hurdles and to increase the pace of research into HRFDs, the UAB Engineered Models Core (Core B) will generate mutations in HRFD/cilia related genes in cell lines, C. elegans, zebrafish, and mice using CRISPR based strategies and through ES cells provided by the mouse targeted knockout consortia. The Core will also generate in vivo mouse and zebrafish models expressing human disease alleles. This will allow the assessment of the pathogenic consequence of missense mutations in cyst progression. To facilitate intravital analyses of pathways associated with cystic disease, Core B will generate several biosensor lines to evaluate changes in cytosolic and ciliary Ca2+ and cAMP levels as well as a CiliaRFP mouse to visualize and analyze cilia in live tissues in situ. It can often take up to a year to establish new models at an investigator's home institution which prevents the rapid testing of novel hypotheses. PKD, MKS, NPHP, JBTS, and BBS models made available through Core B's efforts will be essential resources for analyzing cystogenic pathways and in preclinical trails that will conducted by the user base through the Center's Cell Physiology Core (Core C) and the Therapeutic Screening and Development Core (Core D). Finally, Core B will benefit Center members by providing biological reagents (tissue samples, blood, urine, DNA, RNA, protein) derived from our HRFD mutant models. These resources will facilitate pilot studies to test innovative hypotheses, preliminary studies needed for grant submissions, and conformational studies of in vitro findings without requiring the line be established at an investigators home institution. Overall, these genetic tools and biological resources that will be made available through Core B will provide a comprehensive and integrated set of resources examining the role of cilia and HRFD genes in cyst pathogenesis and for analyzing new treatment strategies."
"9475397","HIV/SIV infections lead to a breakdown of the integrity of the epithelial mucosa resulting in severe microbial dysbiosis and chronic immune activation that ultimately drive disease progression. Moreover, disruption of one of the most understudied mucosal environments, the oral cavity, during HIV-induced immunosuppression can result in candidiasis, necrotizing gingivitis, periodontitis, hairy leukoplakia, increased oral tumors, and can also contribute to and predict distal disease complications elsewhere. ROR?t+ innate lymphoid cells type 3 (ILC3) produce IL-17 and IL-22 and are vital for maintaining the integrity of the GI epithelium, mediating mucosal antimicrobial defense and stability of commensal microflora, but others and we have recently shown massive, systemic alterations in ILC3 numbers and functions in the oral, reproductive and gastrointestinal mucosae (Li and Reeves, Front Immunol, 2013; Li et al., PLoS Path, 2014). Furthermore, in our unpublished preliminary data we show: 1. SIV infection induces a highly inflammatory and cytotoxic ILC3 phenotype in the oral cavity; 2. Efficient depletion in oral, colorectal, and vaginal mucosae using a novel ILC3-depleting antibody developed by our laboratory specifically for rhesus macaques. 3. Dysbiosis of specific microbial species is associated with chronic immune activation; and 4. Probiotic therapy reduces immune activation during SIV infection and induces expansion of functional ILC3 numbers in the mucosae. In this innovative and transformative proposal we will evaluate the core hypothesis that ILC3 act as a sensitive and targetable modulator for mucosal homeostasis, immune activation, and microflora in the oral cavity through three complementary specific aims: 1. Experimentally determine the role of ILCs in modulating the oral microbiome and oral mucosae homeostasis; 2. Define the kinetics, activation, and detailed immunologic effects of SIV infection on ILCs and microbiome in the oral cavity; and 3. Investigate the effects of probiotic therapy on oral ILCs and microbiome during chronic treated and untreated SIV infection."
"9386036","ABSTRACT The overarching goal of this research is to develop and test an innovative strategy to improve linkage to and retention in hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment among individuals recently released from jail. Dr. Matthew Akiyama is proposing a K99/R00 career development and research plan which will prepare him to develop interventions to improve linkage to and retention in HCV care among individuals with criminal justice system involvement. HCV is the leading cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in the United States and, as of 2007, superseded HIV as a cause of death. A strong interrelationship with substance use disorders has led to epidemic proportions of HCV in correctional settings, with a prevalence of 17.4% compared with a national HCV prevalence of only 1.3%. Care coordination programs improve linkage to care among HIV+ individuals leaving correctional settings, yet no prospective studies have evaluated the strategy of care coordination for HCV+ individuals leaving correctional settings. In addition, while peers have been used in diverse settings to address barriers to medical care and are effective at increasing health knowledge, reducing risk behaviors, and facilitating linkage to health care, peer interventions have not been studied for HCV+ individuals leaving correctional settings. Dr. Akiyama has been a key contributor to the development of a care coordination intervention for improving linkage to HCV treatment that is currently underway in the New York City jail system. This proposal builds on this experience and extends it in several important ways. The goal of the mentored (K99) phase of this proposal is to provide Dr. Akiyama with sufficient training in four key skills: 1) advanced qualitative/mixed methods research, 2) developing behavioral interventions, 3) design and conduct of randomized controlled trials in correctional settings, and 4) statistical analysis of longitudinal and clustered data specific to criminal justice populations. During the mentored (K99) phase of the award we will achieve the following specific aims: 1) To identify barriers to and facilitators of linkage to care in an existing HCV care coordination program and 2) To use the barriers and facilitators identified in Aim 1 to design an enhanced, tailored, care coordination intervention with peers as a central component. In the independent R00 phase of the award, we will 3) test the feasibility and effectiveness of the peer- enhanced, tailored, care coordination intervention using a randomized design. We hypothesize that the tailored intervention, enhanced by peers, will lead to greater rates of linkage to HCV treatment, treatment initiation, treatment completion, sustained virologic response, and lower rates of HCV risk behavior. Completion of the proposed pilot trial during the R00 phase along with intensive mentorship during the K99 phase will prepare Dr. Akiyama to test the peer-enhanced care coordination intervention in a multisite randomized controlled trial in a future R01. The proposed K99/R00 award will provide training, mentorship, and research experience that will serve as the foundation for Dr. Akiyama's career as an independently funded clinical investigator dedicated to improving health outcomes for HCV+ individuals with criminal justice system involvement."
"9338972","Project Summary/Abstract  Transient receptor potential (Trp) channels are involved in many fundamental cell functions and associated with many disease states (65). Trpm channels are a subgroup of Trp channel superfamily. Trpm2 is expressed in many tissues including heart, vasculature, hematopoietic cells and brain. Trpm2 is activated by ADP-ribose (ADPR) and H2O2 and mediates Ca2+ influx into the cell. Trpm2 has an essential role in susceptibility to oxidative stress. The existing paradigm is that activation of Trpm2 induces cell death by sustained increases in [Ca2+]i, or mediates enhanced chemokine production in hematopoietic cells thereby aggravating inflammatory response and tissue injury. Quite unexpectedly, our recent data demonstrated that Trpm2 is essential in cellular bioenergetics maintenance in both the heart and neuroblastoma; and that Trpm2 actually protects the heart and neuroblastoma from oxidative-stress induced injury. Trpm2 is overexpressed in many cancers and the level of Trpm2 overexpression correlated with decreased patient survival and increased propensity for metastasis in some tumors. Based on these observations, Trpm2 has increasingly become a rational target for cancer therapy. In support of this concept, we showed that neuroblastoma xenografts over- expressing the dominant-negative Trpm2-S had significantly suppressed growth and enhanced sensitivity to doxorubicin (Doxo). In addition, targeting Trpm2 was recently shown to promote cell death in T cell leukemia. Therefore, although Trpm2 inhibition can enhance the therapeutic effect of chemotherapy (e.g., Doxo), it may inadvertently disturb mitochondrial energy metabolism and redox balance and as such, aggravate existing ischemic heart disease and Doxo-induced cardiomyopathy. The study of mechanisms by which Trpm2 protects the heart is thus timely and will significantly contribute to the nascent field of onco-cardiology.  We are the first to demonstrate that Trpm2 channels are expressed at the sarcolemma and t-tubules and measure Trpm2 channel activity in adult mouse LV myocytes. We have obtained preliminary data indicating Trpm2 activation phosphorylates proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2), one of Ca2+- and redox- sensitive non-receptor tyrosine kinase in the heart, that subsequently translocates to mitochondrial matrix. We have shown that phosphorylated Pyk2 (pPyk2) can enhance mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake through mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU). To explore the function of Trpm2 in cardiac myocytes, we have generated both global Trpm2 knockout (gKO) and cardiac-specific Trpm2 KO (cKO) mice. Compared to WT myocytes, gKO myocytes had decreased expression of proteins involved in mitochondrial function and oxidative defense. Functionally, gKO myocytes had lower mitochondrial membrane potential (??m), reduced MCU activity, decreased mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, increased mitochondrial superoxide (O2-.) levels, decreased oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and lower ATP levels: indicating compromised cellular bioenergetics and redox balance. Although baseline cardiac performance was similar between WT and gKO hearts, the deleterious effects of abnormal cellular energetics and redox balance were manifest in 2 models of oxidative stress: Doxo cardiomyopathy and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Taken together, we hypothesize that tonic activation of Trpm2 by basal levels of H2O2 emitted by respiring cardiac mitochondria under physiological conditions facilitates the essential mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake through pPyk2-mediated MCU activation for bioenergetics maintenance and redox balance. Under stress, ablation or inhibition of Trpm2 results in insufficient cellular bioenergetics and augmented oxidative stress, causing compromised myocardial performance. Consequently, targeting Trpm2 channels in cancer cells without adequate cardiac protection may have serious untoward cardiac side effects including increased mortality. We propose the following to evaluate Trpm2 function in the heart in health and disease: Specific Aim 1: What is the signaling mechanism for Trpm2-mediated increases in cellular energy production? We hypothesize that Trpm2 activation phosphorylates Pyk2 and the activated pPyk2 translocates to mitochondrial matrix, which leads to enhanced mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake through MCU, thereby enhancing Ca2+ -regulated ATP generation. Specific Aim 2: What is the mechanism for Trpm2-mediated decreases in ROS generation? We hypothesize that Trpm2-mediated Ca2+ influx promotes mitochondrial electron transport activity thereby reducing mitochondrial O2-. generation, rather than by modulating NADPH oxidase (NOX) activity to decrease ROS. Trpm2 ablation also results in decreased anti-oxidant protein profiles. Specific Aim 3: Is Trpm2-mediated Ca2+ influx necessary for improvement in in vivo cardiac function post-I/R or Doxo treatment of cKO hearts? We will modulate Trpm2-mediated Ca2+ entry in cardiac myocytes by expressing WT Trpm2, loss-of-function (E960D), increased Ca2+ selectivity (Q981E/P983Y), or inactivation (P1018L) Trpm2 mutants in cKO hearts, subjected to either I/R or Doxo treatment and cardiac performance evaluated. We will also manipulate Pyk2 activity in cKO hearts and assess the effects on cardiac function post-I/R or Doxo treatment. The effects of Trpm2 mutants on expression of proteins involved in oxidative defense will also be evaluated."
"9287076","Abstract Invasive infections caused by opportunistic fungi are increasingly common in the surgical ICU. The mortality rate for fungal sepsis in the ICU patient is 30-40%. It is well accepted that aging plays a critical role in the incidence of sepsis and age is a known independent predictor of mortality in sepsis. Fungal infections have become an increasing problem in older ICU patients. This is due, in part, to the fact that sepsis results in immune suppression. However, it is also known that healthy aged adults show senescence of immune function. In addition, aging patients frequently have multiple co-morbidities and undergo more invasive procedures leading to a higher risk of sepsis. The underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms that result in increased susceptibility to fungal infection in the aged and/or septic patient are not fully understood. The research outlined in this application is focused on addressing that deficit in our knowledge. We have acquired preliminary data which demonstrate that healthy aged individuals (>60 y.o.) show decreased anti-fungal Th17 mediated responses when compared to young healthy controls. We also have preliminary data which indicate that clinical sepsis decreases leukocyte expression of Dectin-1, the primary pattern recognition receptor for induction of anti-fungal innate immunity. Based on these data and the published literature we hypothesize that ?susceptibility to fungal sepsis in the aged critically ill patient is mediated by specific cellular and molecular defects in anti-fungal innate immunity?. To test our hypothesis we propose the three following specific aims. In aim 1 we will identify the age related defects in Dectin-1/Th17 dependent signaling in human leukocytes from healthy adults >60 y.o. We will examine Dectin-1/Th17 mediated intracellular signaling in response to Candida albicans or C. albicans cell wall glucan in leukocytes from adults >60 y.o. and compare them to those from adults <30 y.o. In aim 2 we will identify defects in Dectin-1/Th17 dependent signaling in leukocytes from patients with sepsis. In this aim we will critically evaluate Dectin-1/Th17 mediated signaling in response to Candida albicans or glucan in leukocytes from septic patients and compare them to age matched healthy adults. In aim 3 we will investigate the impact of clinical sepsis on human leukocyte Dectin-1 expression. We will correlate Dectin-1 expression with the type of infection, acute physiology scores and injury indices, length of hospital stay, days in ICU and survival outcome. These experiments will provide new knowledge of the mechanisms that render the aged critically ill patient susceptible to life threatening fungal infections. In addition, we will acquire new clinical data that may identify novel predictors of susceptibility to fungal infection. Finally, we will investigate strategies to increase resistance to opportunistic fungal infections in the critically ill patient."
"9314573","Project Summary  We will continue to design, construct and characterize genetic circuits. We will use micro uidic tools to grow and observe single cells and colonies in precisely controlled environmental conditions, and we will test a subset of the engineered bacterial strains as therapies in animal models. Single cell and colony dynamics will inform mathematical models that will be used to identify key design characteristics, which will then be rigorously tested using previously established molecular biology techniques. Eight graduate students and postdocs will work on multiple aspects of the project, while maintaining a particular focus on modeling or technology development for monitoring bacteria or in vivo characterization. Our track record demonstrates our ability to train personnel in a multi-disciplinary approach that has led to new tools for Synthetic Biology, along with an increased understanding of gene and signaling networks generally.  Our recent characterization of bacterial circuits in animal models has served to highlight the need for bene cial strains that are stable and safe over therapeutically relevant timescales. Accordingly, our Speci c Aims focus on stability (Aim 1), delivery (Aim 2), safety (Aim 3), and in vivo testing (Aim 4). Gene circuits inevitably generate mutations that are selected to decrease the additional burden created by the inserted genetic machinery. Our rst aim will develop strategies for extending the \lifetime of gene circuits in bacteria before selective pressure disables their desired functionality. We will develop computational models and experimentally quantify how circuit redundancy increases circuit lifetime. We will use our experimental platform to monitor functionality across scales from single-cell to batch culture environments. Our second aim will primarily focus on engineering small bacterial ecologies. Here we will use modeling to guide the design of up to three interacting strains that can deliver therapies in a pre-determinted sequential order. In the third aim, we will build a safety circuit that triggers the death of all bacteria at a given threshold population density. The goal is to create an irreversible intracellular switch that rapidly and eciently kills all cells before mutations can compromise the safety strategy. In the nal aim, we will test the circuits designed in the rst three aims in animal models. We will engineer optical markers that enable characterization of the dynamics of bacterial colonies and tumor size in vivo. Importantly, the relative ease and low cost of bacterial cloning will inevitably lead to a bottleneck for the  eld of Synthetic Biology, as therapeutic strains can be created at a rate that will far exceed the ability to test them. This highlights an acute need for quantitative models that have been thoroughly validated using in vitro technologies. Consequently, only a fraction of the circuits built in Aims 1-3 will be deemed worthy of in vivo testing. More generally, we anticipate that the computational models arising from these studies will be generally applicable across a wide range of emerging applications that employ bacteria."
"9325574","PROJECT SUMMARY (See Instructions): _  This program project application comprises a team of investigators with complimentary research strengths and resources that will be harnessed for the development of novel small molecules that antagonize the action of the HIV-1 vif protein. Project 2 (Virologic support for SAR and mechanisms of inhibitor resistance) will predominantly support drug discovery/SAR efforts in Project 1 as well as identifying mutations conferring inhibitor resistance in vitro and in vivo. Specific responsibilities of Project 2 include:  ? Evaluation of antiviral activity of lead compounds and their analogs in permissive and non-permissive cells.  The antiviral activities of analogs emerging from the SAR exercise of Project 1 will be compared in  permissive cells (vif-independent replication) and non-permissive cells (vif-dependent replication) and will be used to drive the design of analogs with more potent antiviral activity.  ? Evaluation of antiviral activity in primary cells relevant to CNS reservoirs of viral replication. Macrophage are the principle cellular targets in the CNS and infected macrophage drive the neuropathogenic manifestations of viral replication. Therefore, vif antagonists will be evaluated for antiviral activity in primary macrophage in vitro.  ? Identification of mechanisms governing inhibitor resistance in vitro and in vivo. HIV-1 will be passaged in non-permissive cells in increasing concentrations of prioritized Vif analogs in order to derive inhibitor resistant virus. In addition, plasma viral RNA from inhibitor-treated macaques (Project 3) will be cloned and sequenced to identify mutations conferring resistance in vivo. Impact of vif-inhibitor resistance on sensitivity to other ARV classes will be conducted with Core B.  The virologic studies outlined in Project 2 will guide the SAR studies and drive the prioritization of analogs that go forward for analysis of in vivo efficacy in macaques."
"9283073","Glioblastoma (GBM), a primary brain tumor, remains an unmet medical need. The major obstacles to GBM treatment are the accessibility of GBM tumors to drugs through natural physiological and pathobiological barriers like the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-brain tumor barrier (BBTB), respectively, and the adequate properties of drugs. In addition, complex pathobiology of GBM, including local invasion and intratumoral heterogeneity represent major challenges to generating effective anti-GBM drugs. The unifying theme of our PPG is the exploitation of local access to brain tumors like GBM to achieve and then maximize therapeutic effect in patients. This local access can be accomplished either by direct loco-regional delivery of drugs into the tumor mass and its vicinity or by disrupting the BBB/BBTB. For example, drugs can be delivered locally through convection-enhanced delivery (CED). The overall hypothesis of this PPG is that we can deliver the next generation of molecularly targeted drug candidates to GBM effectively by either significantly re- designed CED and/or by precision BBB/BBTB disruption. To address this hypothesis, we are developing convection-enhanced thermo-chemotherapy catheter system (CETCS) based on a novel arborizing catheter. Furthermore, the BBB disruption will be tested in two innovative ways using: (i) high-frequency irreversible electroporation (H-FIRE), or (ii) a combined approach of stem cells expressing tumor necrosis factor-? (TNF?), a cytokine with a potential to significantly enhance BBB permeability, under a heat responsive promoter that can be remotely activated using high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). We will exploit a unique animal model of spontaneous gliomas in dogs, which is amenable to testing medical devices/surgical procedures, and thus is one of the most valuable tools in addressing our PPG's unifying theme. We will explore our hypothesis in three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will generate targeted cytotoxic drugs with an increased access to tumors and/or pathophysiologically important tumor compartments. We will generate targeted drug conjugates with BBB-penetrating chemotherapeutics. In Aim2, we will attempt to bypass the BBB/BBTB by developing CED that addresses critical clinical needs. We will evaluate an arborizing catheter for broad distribution of infusates and accurate saturation of target volume in brain tissue. We will evaluate targeted drugs distribution and efficacy by CETCS for treating spontaneous GBM in a canine model. In Aim 3, we will bypass the BBB/BBTB by induced disruption. This will be achieved with H-FIRE treatment allowing for preferential targeting infiltrating tumor cells. We will assess H-FIRE protocols to combinatorially treat spontaneous gliomas in dogs with targeted cytotoxic agents. We will also examine stem cells engineered to express TNF?. Thus, our PPG proposal represents a combined rational approach of novel therapeutic approaches to improve delivery of unique drug candidates of enhanced access to GBM tumor and its compartments. This program is well suited for rapid translation to clinical settings in a foreseeable future."
"9472717","ABSTRACT Full mutation of the FMR1 gene causes loss of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and fragile X syndrome (FXS) characterized by intellectual disability with devastating cognitive consequences and features of autism. Study of Fmr1 knockout (KO) mouse models of the FXS genetic defect identified that loss of FMRP dysregulates translation at synapses, leading to synaptic dysfunction, for example excessive synaptic depression in response to group 1 mGluR stimulation. Unfortunately, despite substantial knowledge of the molecular consequences of FMR1 alteration, how the molecular changes lead to the clinical, cognitive manifestations is unknown. We consider a systems level analysis and use the hippocampus as a model cognitive system. We propose that impaired cognition in Fmr1 KO mice is due to the inability of information-carrying hippocampus principal cell spike trains to represent distinct streams of information because of the dysregulation of synaptic transmission. As a result, cognitive deficits primarily manifest when FXS model mice are challenged to generate distinctive neural representations in situations that are inconsistent with the information they have previously learned. Preliminary findings from analysis of temporal coordination amongst hippocampal place cell spike trains, local field potentials (LFPs), and conjoint action potential and LFP (spike-field) coordination provide substantial evidence in support of the central ?excitation-inhibition discoordination? hypothesis of this work. The hypothesis asserts that cognitive deficits in FXS arise because dysregulated learning-induced changes of synaptic network function cause discoordinated discharge within networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. We test the hypothesis by comparing FXS model and control mice in a variety of memory discrimination tasks. We will examine conventional Fmr1 KO mice in which the gene is mutated in all cells, as well as mice in which the mutation is restricted to excitatory (Fmr1 KOe) or inhibitory (Fmr1 KOi) neurons to learn whether dysfunction in one cell class is sufficient to cause cognitive dysfunction. We will also measure how memory training changes synaptic function within the hippocampus circuit by recording evoked potentials across the somatodendritic synaptic compartments of dorsal hippocampus in freely-behaving mice. Finally, we will investigate abnormalities in how memory-related Fmr1 place cell ensemble discharge is controlled by oscillations in the LFP that arise from inputs at distinctive dendritic compartments and causally test whether the abnormality contributes to memory discrimination impairment using chemogenetic manipulations of the inputs. These studies evaluate a novel, circuit-driven neuromodulatory therapeutic concept for reducing cognitive disability in FXS and perhaps other disorders."
"9383681","Project Summary/Abstract Adenosine Deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs) are a family of RNA editing enzymes that convert adenosines to inosines in double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). ADARs are essential in mammals and required for the health of all animals. An important function of ADARs is to target codons to allow a single mRNA to give rise to multiple protein isoforms. Surprisingly, in all studied organisms, recoding editing sites are rare compared to the extensive, non-selective, editing that occurs in noncoding regions of mRNAs, such as introns and untranslated regions. The functions of non-selective editing are unknown, and the proposed research will capitalize on technological advances, such as RNAseq and CRISPR protocols, to fill this gap in knowledge. Studies will utilize the model organism C. elegans, since non-selective editing may be solely responsible for phenotypes of C. elegans lacking ADARs. Experiments will test a model whereby non-selective editing precludes Dicer processing of dsRNA, thus regulating gene silencing in a developmental and tissue-specific manner. Studies are facilitated by the genome-wide identification of Editing-Enriched Regions (EERs), which define the non-selectively edited dsRNAome. RNAseq analyses will define expression of EER-associated genes, and endogenous siRNAs (endo-siRNAs) matching these genes, to reveal genes that are good candidates for ADAR regulation of gene silencing. Deletion of the EER with CRISPR protocols will allow confirmation that ADAR regulation depends on the presence of the EER. Endo-siRNAs aligning to EERs have features of direct Dicer products, a species of small RNA not previously observed among C. elegans endo- siRNAs. Factors involved in the biogenesis of, and silencing by, this newly identified class of endo-siRNAs will be identified with a screen using a C. elegans strain expressing a GFP reporter that is silenced in an ADAR mutant strain. Proposed studies will yield strains that lack double-stranded EER(s) in specific genes, and ADAR mutant strains with additional deletions in factors that rescue ADAR-regulated silencing. These strains will be tested for their ability to rescue phenotypes of C. elegans lacking ADARs. While correlation of a phenotype to a specific gene will be a priority, a degron protocol will provide an alternate strategy. Studies are designed to provide long-awaited details about the functions of C. elegans ADARs, and pave the way for defining similarities and differences in roles of non-selective editing in other organisms."
"9350413","Abstract  Health services and especially community-based health services in Africa are characterized by inefficiency, limited capacity, and poorly-trained personnel. The quality of care in these systems is dependent most heavily on personnel: training, monitoring, and ongoing quality of the implementation. South Africa is deploying 65,000 community health workers (CHW), however, there are almost no systems currently, nor are the systems yet planned for how to train, monitor, and ensure quality care is delivered by these CHW. In a pilot over the last six months in the Eastern Cape of South Africa, we found 25% of CHW not showing up for work at any time, when supervision was out-sourced for the first time. Such performance and failures to monitor performance, with consequences of censuring non-attendance, are often typical of CHW service delivery in low and middle income countries (LMIC). Building on the results of a successful effectiveness study in the townships of Cape Town, South Africa, we aim to show that training, monitoring, and data-informed supervision will result in CHW having significant benefits in maternal and child health (MCH) over the first two years of life, particularly mothers living with HIV, depressed mothers, and teenage mothers. With support from the provincial government, Philani's innovative training and monitoring strategies aim to demonstrate that we can decrease the gap between what we know (based on science) and what we do to improve health in rural communities that currently lack accountability and efficiency.  UCLA, Stellenbosch University, Zithulele Hospital, and the Philani Maternal, Child Health and Nutrition Trust will collaborate on this second effectiveness RCT of home visiting delivered by government-funded CHW. UCLA will randomize 24 matched areas, each with government-funded CHW to either: 1) home visiting trained, supervised, and routinely monitored (i.e., the Philani Intervention Model [PIM], n=420 women, 12 areas); or 2) a standard care (SC) control home visiting by CHW who receive current standards of training, monitoring, and supervision (n=420 women, 12 areas). Within the sample, 25% will be adolescent mothers; 30% will be MLH; 25% will drink alcohol in pregnancy; and 22% will be depressed. Independent assessments will be conducted by Stellenbosch University during pregnancy, within two weeks of post-birth, 6, 15, and 24 months later. We will construct an overall analytic test which examines multiple outcomes simultaneously with an omnibus test. We will monitor MLH's HIV testing, linkage to care, treatment adherence and retention; maternal health indicators (weight, diabetes, mental health status, partnerships, alcohol use, and partner violence); and, the child's physical growth, cognitive, affective, and behavioral adjustment. We expect PIM to significantly improve outcomes overall and for the high risk subgroups (MLH, depressed, adolescents, alcohol-using). Analyses of the real-time process measures from CHW (duration, frequency, content area, skill used, phone contacts) collected on mobiles will allow us to design and redesign implementation strategies."
"9329524","The Transplant Pathology and Tissue Imaging Core (Core B) will play a critical, strongly-integrated scientific role in supporting the 2 Projects with strong emphasis on the central focus of the Program. The Program concerns regulatory immune cell therapy using innovative strategies, analysis of underlying mechanisms and novel biomarker studies in NHP renal transplantation. Each Project requires: 1) analysis of routinely-stained slides for pathologic processes relevant to rejection and analyses of allograft tissue from recipients that may exhibit operational tolerance; 2) transplant tissues will be evaluated for cellular and molecular evidence of rejection or tolerance, including the presence and phenotype of APCs, NK cells, effector and regulatory T cell subsets, B cell populations and their expression of molecules relevant to mechanistic aspects of the study and 3) the effects of these cells, molecules and their interactions on surrounding tissues, and vice versa. The Core is ideally suited to conduct these studies because: a) the Core Leader has long-standing experience, including studies on clinical operational tolerance and published extensively (including with other Program investigators in this area; and b) the Core has developed cutting-edge pathology and image analysis tools (multiplex quantum dot immunolabeling combined with high resolution whole slide image (WSI) digital scanning and automated/computerized image analysis that enables more in- depth and objective evaluation of tissue to quantitatively study social/interactive and 3-dimensional relationships between and among various infiltrative cell types and parenchymal and stromal tissues. The principal roles of the Core are: A) Detailed histopathologic assessment of native and allograft tissue specimens, including scoring of standardized histopathologic and immunohistochemical parameters, and rendering diagnoses relevant to rejection/tolerance. B) Specialized multiplex quantum dot-based immunolabeling analyses to localize, quantify, and assess donor- specific effector, memory T cells and Treg responses. In addition, we will seek to validate the Tmem transcription factor eomesodermin as a predictive biomarker of graft rejection vs. tolerance. C) Create high resolution (40x) WSI files so that tissue sections can be reviewed and analyzed, in detail, on a computer screen instead of at a microscope and assist investigators in automated image analysis. D) Prioritize specimen analyses and communicate results and interpretations to the PLs of each project and suggesting alternatives where appropriate; participate in Program investigator meetings, as arranged by Core A."
"9449164","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a new application from the Menopause Strategies: Finding Lasting Answers for Symptoms and Health (MsFLASH) Clinical Trials network. By the end of 2014, the network will have completed 4 clinical trials testing 7 interventions in approximately 1000 women ages 40-62 with vasomotor (VMS) and other menopause symptoms. In the new application, we propose to conduct a large multicenter trial on a relatively understudied area of menopause - vaginal health and sexual function. The number of US women over age 65 is expected to double by 2022 and approximately 40% will experience bothersome vaginal symptoms, 75% may have vaginal dryness and up to 40% may experience pain with intercourse. To address this vast, understudied problem, we propose in Specific Aim #1 to conduct a 3-arm, randomized, controlled, double-blind, clinical trial among postmenopausal women ages 45-70. We will evaluate the effectiveness of ultra-low dose vaginal estradiol (Vagifem 10 mcg), non-hormonal hydrophilic non-prescriptive vaginal gel (Replens) and placebo in reducing a composite score of vaginal symptoms (dryness, itching, irritation or soreness). Secondary aims include evaluation of sexual function, quality of life, and genitourinary atrophy and the creation of a biorepository of vaginal and blood specimens. In a subset of women, we will also examine whether treatment response is related to: a) the postmenopausal vaginal microbiome; b) vaginal mucosal inflammation; and c) reproductive hormone profiles. The in-depth focus on the mechanisms associated with postmenopausal vaginal symptoms will use state of the art microbiologic techniques on longitudinally collected biologic specimens and will guide future translational studies. Specific Aim #2 addresses common problems for many midlife women and their providers: a) menopausal symptom management decisions can be challenging, due to rapidly changing and sometimes contradictory data on treatment safety and efficacy; and b) individualized decision aids to help women feel fully informed about various menopausal treatment options are lacking. To translate and disseminate our findings on postmenopausal vaginal health, in addition to findings from prior trials on vasomotor, sleep, mood and pain symptoms, we propose to develop and pilot test a comprehensive, state-of- the-art, tailored, multi-media materials aimed at facilitating informed menopausal decision-making for symptomatic women and their providers. Involvement of midlife women and healthcare providers at every stage in the process has been incorporated. This application is novel and transformative for: 1) proposing the first adequately powered, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of hormonal and non-hormonal treatments for postmenopausal vaginal symptoms; and 2) for providing the first, multi-media menopause decision aid that encompasses the latest evidence surrounding all available therapies. These aims are geared to transforming the evidence-base and resources available to aging women for navigating midlife and beyond."

Ongoing funding will allow the Center to continue to support and expand these efforts at BCM."
"9372289","It is imperative that we develop rational and systematic approaches to drug discovery to treat Parkinson's and other neurological disorders. Rodent models are essential to this process, but they may not be the optimal starting place. The LRRK2 G2019S allele is the most common Parkinson's disease mutation and corresponding animal models have been developed in a variety of organisms. While the existing models are valuable, we engineered a zebrafish LRRK2 G2019S line that is a uniquely powerful starting place to accelerate PD therapeutics.  The experimental flexibility of zebrafish including rapid gene targeting and unparalleled high-resolution functional brain imaging empowers studies of molecular, cellular and physiological mechanism of disease. However, the true power of zebrafish to promote PD research lies in the ability to conduct transformative experiments that cannot readily be done with other models. The ability to culture larvae in 96-well dishes and introduce test compounds via the water enables high throughput screening of small molecules using behavioral readouts. Tens of thousands of compounds can be assayed to identify potential therapeutic agents that can then be further refined to streamline the drug discovery pipeline. Our long-term goal is to perform such a screen to search for compounds that modulate Parkinsonian related behaviors using a zebrafish PD model. In order for this approach to be effective, behaviors that reflect those in patients must first be demonstrated in our LRRK2 G2019S mutant. The objectives of this study are to assay PD-related behaviors and dopaminergic populations in the zebrafish LRRK2 G2019S mutants to determine whether this model is a suitable substrate for high throughput chemical screens. If successful, this approach would go beyond identification of direct LRRK2 inhibitors and enable isolation of compounds that influence other processes to compensate for LRRK2 dysfunction.         "
"9398637","PROJECT SUMMARY  In the United States, one in three adults will develop hypertension and require antihypertensive treatments in their lifetime. More importantly, only 50% of patients with hypertension have blood pressure controlled with current antihypertensive drugs. Poorly controlled hypertension is very prevalent in aging men and postmenopausal women with impaired pressure natriuresis response. The factors contributing to poorly controlled hypertension remain to be determined. It is clear, however, the development of all forms of hypertension will require continuously resetting of the pressure natriuresis response to higher pressures. Although previous studies have implicated the Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3) in the pressure natriuresis response and angiotensin II (ANG II)-dependent hypertension, whether NHE3 in the proximal tubules of the kidney is directly involved in the physiological pressure natriuresis response and its resetting in ANG II-induced hypertension has never been specifically investigated previously. We have strong preliminary evidence that conditional deletion of NHE3 selectively in the proximal tubules (PT-NHE3-KO), or pharmacological inhibition of NHE3 selectively in the kidney, primarily in the proximal tubules, with a novel orally absorbable NHE3 inhibitor significantly increases the pressure natriuresis response and attenuates ANG II- and salt-induced hypertension by restoring pressure natriuresis response in mice. In this revised proposal, we will test the hypotheses that NHE3 in the proximal tubules of the kidney is directly involved in the physiological pressure natriuresis response and its resetting in ANG II-induced hypertension, and that pharmacological inhibition of NHE3 selectively in the kidney, primarily in the proximal tubules, will attenuate hypertension in animal models of genetic-, ANG II-, aging-, and sex-associated hypertension by restoring pressure natriuresis responses. In Specific Aim 1, we will test whether deletion of NHE3 selectively in the proximal tubules will increase pressure natriuresis response and lower blood pressure by inhibiting proximal tubule Na+ reabsorption, whereas upregulation, via overexpression, of NHE3 selectively in the proximal tubules will impair and reset pressure natriuresis response to higher pressures by stimulating proximal tubule Na+ reabsorption and promoting salt sensitivity of blood pressure. In a revised Specific Aim 2, we will test whether NHE3 in the proximal tubules is directly involved in the physiological pressure natriuresis responses to acute saline volume expansion, natriuretic peptides, or activation of AT2 receptor/NO/cGMP signaling, and in the resetting of pressure natriuresis responses in ANG II-, L-NAME-, aging- and sex-associated hypertension. In Specific Aim 3, we will test whether inhibition of NHE3 selectively in the kidney, primarily in the proximal tubules, with an orally absorbable NHE3 inhibitor will attenuate genetic-, ANG II-, aging- and sex-associated hypertension by restoring pressure natriuresis responses. The successful outcomes of this proposal will help develop novel drugs to treat poorly controlled or resistant hypertension by selectively targeting NHE3 in the proximal tubules."
"9388410","Many of major autoimmune diseases are sexually dimorphic. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma, multiple sclerosis, Sjogren's syndrome, and some forms of Type 1 diabetes (T1D) are primarily occurring in females. It has been attributed to multiple factors including expression of the genes encoded by sex chromosomes, hormonal regulation of gene expression, and lately to unexpected regulation by commensal microbiota. Thus, understanding of sexual dimorphism of diseases requires that the problem be approached by a combination of different strategies. In this proposal, we take advantage of our abilities to perform state of the art experiments using genetically modified and gnotobiotic animals with original and constantly developing computational methods. Our preliminary data demonstrates the efficiency of such an integrative approach to the problem. We have suggested a `dual signal' model of autoimmunity involving regulation by microbes and sex hormones. Accordingly, hormonal and microbial influences do not have to be simultaneous: they may be important at different stages of development or disease progression. We already identified a number of genes that are regulated by hormone (androgen) receptors and are now posed to elucidate the connection between such regulation and autoimmunity. Given the complexity of the problem, we plan to pursue several carefully selected goals that will lay foundation for the future expansion of research in this important area. Aim 1: Test the dual signal model of microbial involvement in sexual dimorphism of autoimmunity. We will test whether gene expression patterns and chromatin status in T cells and macrophages are regulated by hormones independently of the microbiota. Aim 2: Elucidate specific mechanisms involved in hormonal regulation of immunity We will study the mechanisms of hormone and microbe-dependent regulation of IFN? production: we will test the hypothesis that a long non-coding RNA termed NeST controls the gender bias of IFN? production, and test its relevance to the gender bias in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). We will study the role of sex hormones in contribution to expression of regulatory phosphatase Ptpn22 and its role in T1D. Aim 3: The role of microbiota in sexual dimorphism of systemic autoimmunity To determine how general the role of microbiota is in sexual dimorphism, we will test a model of systemic autoimmunity with well-established sexual dimorphism -B6.NZM mice- in SPF and GF conditions. We will determine a role of model genes regulated by androgens (NeST and Ptpn22) we will manipulate hormone-responsive elements in their promoters and test the consequences in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)."

"9239551","PROJECT SUMMARY Transition metal ions are essential nutrients for all organisms. The availability of these nutrients plays a critical role in the host-microbe interaction and microbial pathogenesis. The primary objective of this research proposal is to elucidate how the host-defense protein calprotectin (CP) sequesters transition metals from microbes and thereby contributes to the innate immune response. CP provides a remarkable example of unique biological coordination chemistry that is relevant to infectious disease and microbial pathogenesis. Each CP heterodimer (S100A8/S100A9) exhibits six different sites for chelating divalent cations, including calcium (Ca) and transition metals. Our central hypothesis is that CP responds to physiological Ca(II) gradients to tune its coordination chemistry for transition metals and to modulate its biological function as an antimicrobial protein that deprives invading pathogens of essential nutrient metals (e.g. manganese, iron, zinc). The proposed investigations are based on preliminary data that Ca(II) binding by human CP (hCP) at the EF- hand domains triggers high-affinity chelation of transition metals at sites formed at the interface of the S100A8 and S100A9 subunits. In Aim 1, we will investigate how Ca(II) ions modulate hCP structure and tune its affinities for transition metals. In Aim 2, we will evaluate how the murine orthologue (mCP) sequesters transition metals and thereby provide needed molecular and biophysical insights into literature results of CP from animal models of infection. In Aim 3, we will investigate the competition between CP and bacterial metal- transport machinery for manganese(II). These fundamental bioinorganic and biophysical initiatives constitute an innovative departure from biological and medical studies of CP, and highlight the importance of applying quantitative analytical and spectroscopic methods to a problem central to human health and disease. Taken together, the results will provide new molecular insights into how CP contributes to innate immunity and metal homeostasis. Moreover, the ability to acquire metal ions is an important facet of microbial pathogenesis, and both intercepting microbial metal acquisition and boosting the metal-withholding response of the host present opportunities for antibiotic development. We anticipate that the results from our work will, in the long term, help to guide the development of new antimicrobial therapeutics that target these processes central to the host- pathogen interaction."
"9311160","Project Summary  We aim to develop novel computational approaches to improve detection of risk genes and prediction of functional effects of germline mutations in patients with developmental disorders by integrating somatic cancer mutation and functional genomic data.  Developmental disorders (DD), including neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) and structural birth defects, affect ~5% of all newborns and have a significant impact on families and society. In the past few years, large-scale family-based sequencing studies on DD, such as autism and congenital heart disease, have identified a large number of de novo variants potentially implicated in disease. Unlike many other pediatric Mendelian diseases, genetic diagnosis of DD by genome or exome sequencing is more challenging because: (a) the complete catalog of DD genes (likely ~1,000) is not yet available; (b) observed variants are often difficult to interpret due to lack of rapid and cost-effective functional assays. Therefore, improved ability to identify novel risk genes and predict the functional effects of missense variants would significantly improve our ability to diagnose DD and develop targeted therapeutic approaches. Cancer is driven by dysregulation of core cellular processes that are also important to DD, such as proliferation, growth, and differentiation. There are well known genes implicated in both cancer and DD with somatic driver mutations in cancer and highly- penetrant germline de novo variants in DD. We analyzed data from recent large-scale genomic studies of cancer and DD, and found a large number of genes potentially implicated in both diseases, and many of them have similar molecular modes of action across conditions. This indicates that patterns of cancer somatic mutations can provide valuable insights to improve our ability to identify causal variants and genes in patients with DD.  To that end, we have these specific aims: Specific Aim 1. Elucidate common genes and variants disrupted in cancer and DD based on somatic mutations in cancer and germline de novo mutations in DD. Specific Aim 2. Infer dosage sensitive genes by integrating mutation data in cancer and developmental disorders with functional genomic data. Specific Aim 3. Software development and data sharing.  With the proposed new computational approaches, we will be able to leverage the accumulating cancer somatic mutation data from international cancer precision medicine efforts. In this framework, tumor samples will be natural ?laboratories? for large-scale functional assays in cancer driver genes. This strategy will improve the utility of cross-field genomic data, and allow us to better predict functional effects of candidate variants (especially missense variants) in genetic diagnosis and identify novel risk genes for developmental disorders."
"9341892","PHS Fellowship Supplemental Form 7. Project Summary/Abstract There is growing recognition that cell non-autonomous signals play a major role in both normative aging and in Alzheimer?s Disease (AD); however, the mechanisms underlying these processes remain largely unknown. Extracellular vesicles (ECVs) represent a major system for the transduction of cell non-autonomous signals as well as a pathological macromolecule integral to Alzheimer?s disease, including misfolded or aggregation-prone proteins and peptides. However, there is is no simple genetic model by which the physiology of these processes can be studied. I propose to develop the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a powerful model for the study of ECV signaling in normative aging and Alzheimer?s disease. In this proposal I will (1) determine the physiological relevance of nematode ECV signaling in cell non-autonomous mechanisms of longevity determination (2) uncover the role of ECV-signaling in spreading A 1-42 from cell to cell (3) and compare the effects of normative aging and AD on the abundance and compositions of ECVs from C. elegans ECVs and human patient cerebrospinal fluid samples. These studies will leverage the resources of both the UW Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in the Basic Biology of Aging as well as the UW Alzheimer?s Disease Research Center to provide key insights into the composition of ECVs from both C. elegans and AD patients, and will set the stage for a detailed mechanistic understanding of the effect of aging on ECV function and the role of ECVs in aging and Alzheimer?s disease."

The Center includes four Research Projects (1: led by Dr. Karl Deisseroth, focusing on methamphetamine, MDMA and ketamine action in the cortex and across the brain of mice and rats; 2: led by Dr. Lisa Giocomo, focusing on methamphetamine and ketamine action in entorhinal cortex and hippocampal formation of mice and rats; 3: led by Dr. Robert Malenka, focusing on methamphetamine and MDMA action across the brain of mice; and 4: led by Dr. Leanne Williams and Brian Knutson, focusing on human structural and functional imaging relevant to methamphetamine, ketamine, MDMA, and risk/reward relationships. Broad and diverse interactions among these groups and external collaborators will be further enriched by the Center?s vital Training Core for disseminating these techniques to advance drug abuse research, a Technology Core for developing the next- generation technologies suitable for application to drug abuse research, and an Administrative Core for orchestrating these important interactions. This approach to the NIDA Center will allow us to capitalize on the unique strengths of our team, crossing scales from molecules and synapses, to circuits and behavior, reaching the scope of the intact human brain as we identify relevant structure-activity relationships within animal and human nervous systems."
"9324829","Abstract: Cell and Tissue Imaging Facility (CTIF)  Over the last several years, microscopy as a scientific tool has reinvented itself. It has changed from a group  of principally descriptive methodologies, to a wide range of primary tools and techniques to investigate the  molecular organization of organs, tissues and cells. Advances in microscope and camera design, fluorescent  dye technology and the development of fluorescent proteins and multiple other novel imaging methods  including, Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer Microscopy (FRET), and Total Internal Reflection  Fluorescence Microscopy (TIRF) have made the simultaneous resolution and quantitation of multiple  concurrent molecular markers for both protein and DNA at a sub-micron resolution a reality. This is particularly  the case when recent advances in super-resolution approaches (SIM/STORM/PALM) are included in this  rubric. Finally, expansion of multiphoton and multispectral tools allow high resolution imaging in living animals  at depth with spectral fidelity. The specific aims of the CTIF are to: 1) provide professional expertise in the  design and implementation of experiments that use microscopy techniques and image analysis, including  interpretation of morphological data; 2) prepare, store and optimally analyze tissues and cells via  morphological and mRNA and protein localization techniques; 3) provide fixed cell and tissue imaging to UPCI  investigators; 4) provide live cell, live tissue, and live animal imaging to UPCI project leaders; 5) perform  detailed electron microscopy analysis of tissue structure, 6) provide training related to use of and access to all  instrumentation used within CTIF, and 7) assist with experimental design and refinement, and evaluate  experimental results, which includes developing and implementing appropriate software algorithms to provide  quantitative measurements. The Center for Biologic Imaging (CBI) was established at the University of  Pittsburgh in 1991 and the UPCI Cell and Tissue Imaging Facility (CTIF) was started as an offshoot of CBI  eleven years ago. Since then the CTIF has become an essential resource for most of the research programs  within UPCI. The CTIF described in this narrative performs microscopic analyses services for members of the  UPCI research community, ranging from the traditional to the cutting edge, using a full complement of  microscope technologies. A satellite facility of the CTIF, established in the Hillman Cancer Center specifically  to supply imaging capabilities to researchers at this location in 2009, continues to benefit the Hillman  investigators. The ability to establish and support the CTIF satellite facility has required a significant  investment in instrumentation and personnel. CTIF support requested in this application will be used to  provide support for personnel who provide advanced microscopy support at the main CTIF center on the  Oakland campus and also to provide resources for the satellite facility in the Shadyside campus. During the  current project period investigators in all 10 of the UPCI Research Programs used the CTIF."
"9238964","Program DirectorJPrincipallnvestigator (Last, First, Middle): Lewis, Richard S. PROJECT SUMMARY Signaling through store-operated Ca2+ channels (SOCs) is critical for many physiological processes including immune cell activation and differentiation. Accordingly, the loss of SOC function leads directly to a lethal severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome in humans. SOCs are activated by the depletion of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which causes the ER Ca2+sensor STIM1 to accumulate at ER-plasma membrane (PM) junctions where it binds and activates Orai1, the pore-forming subunit of the Ca2+release- activatedCa2+(CRAC)channel,triggeringCa2+entryintothecell.Ourlong-termgoalistounderstandin molecular detail the underlying mechanisms that control Ca2+ influx through CRAC channels. We have developed a number of new approaches to tackle these issues, including single-molecule tracking of STIM1 and Orai1, gene editing with CRISPR/Cas9 to label and mutagenize endogenous proteins, tandem concatemers of Orai1 that allow subunit-selective mutagenesis of the CRAC channel, and single-molecule FRET to probe conformational dynamics in a highly defined in vitro system. Over the next five years, we will apply these approaches to understand CRAC channel regulation in three areas. First, we aim to understand the mechanisms of native STIM1 and Orai1 localization and interaction at ER-PM junctions. Nearly all we know about the SOC mechanism is based on heterologous high-level overexpression of STIM1 and Orai1, which is likely to override many important regulatory mechanisms involving low amounts of accessory proteins. We will exploit gene editing techniques to label and modify endogenous STIM1 and Orai1 and study the factors that control the initial trapping of STIM1 by the PM, the residence time of Orai1 in junctions, and the stOichiometry and interaction kinetics of STIM1 and Orai1 at native junctions. Second, we will extend mechanistic studies of Ca2+-dependent inactivation (COl), the predominant mechanism for feedback inhibition of CRAC channels. By subunit-selective mutagenesis of hexameric Orai1 concatemers we will characterize the interactions of STIM1 with the II-III intracellular loop and selected pore residues of Orai1 that drive conformational changes underlying COl. The third and major focus will be to identify the dynamic conformational changes that underlie activation of STIM1 and Orai1. By measuring single-molecule FRET of labeled STIM1 and Orai1 in vitro, we will identify the structures that keep STIM1 inactive and how they rearrange after store depletion to activate STIM1. The single-molecule approach will be widely applied to other questions such as the stoichiometry, dynamics and conformation of STIM1 binding to Orai1 as well as the conformational changes leading to Orai1 pore opening and the effects of purified accessory proteins thought to modulate STIM-Orai interactions in living cells. These studies have the potential to resolve many of the most difficult and important issues related to SOC activation, and may suggest new strategies for modulating calcium signals to provide new treatments for autoimmune and immunodeficiency syndromes. RELEVANCE Store-operated calcium channels (SOCs) are essential for activating the immune response, and defects in their operation cause a lethal immunodeficiency in humans. The short-term goal of this proposal is to understand the mechanisms that regulate SOC activity, with the long-term goal of identifying new targets for drug development aimed at enhancing immunity to treat immunosuppressive disorders, or inhibiting the immune response to combat autoimmune disease or prevent the rejection of organ transplants."
"9512220","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this renewal application is to enhance smoking cessation rates for homeless smokers by testing the effects of 1) intensive smoking intervention, and 2) integrating alcohol abuse treatment with smoking cessation. Despite progress in reducing cigarette smoking in the general US population, smoking rates and related heart disease and cancer morbidity remain strikingly high among the poor and underserved. One group generally unreached by smoking cessation interventions are those experiencing homelessness among whom cigarette smoking rate remains an alarming 70 percent or greater. The majority of homeless smokers also abuse alcohol and other drugs, which makes quitting more difficult and magnifies the health consequences of tobacco use. We recently completed the first NIH-funded (R01HL081522; Okuyemi, PI) smoking cessation clinical trial (n=430) targeting homeless smokers with 8-week treatment with nicotine patch and 6 sessions of motivational interviewing. This relatively low intensity study showed cotinine-verified 7-day quit rates of 9.3 percent for MI vs. 5.6 percent for Brief Advice at 26 weeks. We also found that quitting smoking was associated with reduced alcohol use. These smoking quit rates are low compared to the general population, demonstrating the challenge for tobacco interventions in this population and the need for more research. The goal of this renewal application is to evaluate interventions designed to enhance smoking cessation rates for homeless smokers by testing the effects of 1) intensive smoking intervention (i.e. higher dose and duration than our previous R01), and 2) integrating alcohol abuse treatment with smoking cessation. We will utilize a 3-group randomized design to test study hypotheses. The three study conditions are 1) Integrated Intensive Smoking intervention using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) plus Alcohol intervention -(IS+A); 2) Intensive Smoking Intervention using CBT- (IS); or 3) Usual Care (brief smoking cessation and brief alcohol counseling both based on the US Public Health Service's Guidelines)-(UC). In addition, all participants will receive 12-week treatment with combination nicotine patch plus gum or lozenge. Participants will be recruited from homeless shelters and facilities in the Minneapolis/St Paul area. Primary smoking outcome is cotinine-verified 7-day smoking abstinence at week 52 follow-up while Primary alcohol outcome will be breathalyzer-verified 90-day continuous alcohol abstinence at week 52. Recruitment and retention will be enhanced by use of debit cards, bus passes, other non-monetary incentives, attractive intervention materials, collaboration with homeless shelters, and advice from a Community Advisory Board. Findings from proposed research have a high potential to inform treatment of nicotine dependence and alcohol abuse in an underserved population that has been recalcitrant to treatments. Data from this study could influence policy and programs aimed at reducing tobacco- and alcohol- related disease burden in vulnerable populations."
"9494845","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Young gay and bisexual men (YGBM) disproportionately experience depression, anxiety, and substance use problems and are among the highest risk group for HIV infection in the U.S. Diverse methods locate the source of these health disparities in YGBM's exposure to minority stress. In fact, minority stress, psychiatric morbidity, substance use, and HIV risk fuel each other, forming a synergistic threat to YGBM's health. Yet no intervention addresses minority stress, mental health and substance use problems, or their joint impact on HIV risk in this population. Recently discovered minority stress pathways offer clear targets for improving YGBM's mental health and reducing HIV risk. Some of these processes are cognitive and affective in nature, such as internalized homophobia and rejection schemas, whereas others are characterized by behavioral avoidance, such as sexual orientation concealment, unassertiveness, and impulsivity. Strong evidence suggests that each of YGBM's co-occurring health risks is rooted in these minority stress pathways. Preliminary Studies. ESTEEM (Effective Skills to Empower Effective Men) is a 10-session skills-building intervention designed to reduce YGBM's co-occurring health risks by addressing the underlying cognitive, affective, and behavioral pathways through which minority stress impairs health. We created ESTEEM (NIMH R34), by adapting a unified cognitive-behavioral protocol to promote minority stress coping among depressed / anxious and at-risk YGBM. ESTEEM aims to normalize the adverse impact of minority stress, reduce internalized homophobia and rejection schemas, and decrease YGBM's unhealthy avoidance tendencies (e.g., substance use during sex, condom use non-assertion). In a preliminary waitlist trial, ESTEEM significantly reduced YGBM's spectrum of related health threats, making it the first evidence-based intervention to simultaneously improve mental health, substance use, and sexual risk outcomes in YGBM. Methods. To determine (1) the efficacy of ESTEEM compared to community mental health treatment and HIV counseling and testing, (2) whether ESTEEM works through its hypothesized cognitive, affective, and behavioral minority stress processes, and (3) ESTEEM's cost-effectiveness in terms of improved mental health and HIV infections averted. Our primary outcome at baseline, 3-, 6-, and 12-months is protected sex, defined as condomless anal sex in the absence of PrEP or known undetectable viral load of HIV+ primary partners. Secondary outcomes include depression, anxiety, substance use, sexual compulsivity, and PrEP uptake-FDA-approved since our R34 pilot. Deploying stand-alone interventions for separate problems represents the current, but most costly, method of reducing YGBM's mental, behavioral, and sexual health problems. A single intervention that reduces YGBM's depression, anxiety, substance use, and HIV risk by reducing the common minority stress pathways across these problems represents an efficient, cost-effective alternative to currently isolated approaches, and holds great promise for reducing sexual orientation health disparities among young men."
"9216823","The goal of this project is to understand how aging and chronic kidney disease (CKD) promote bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) synthesis that furthers pathological calcification of the heart valves and vasculature. Post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms repress BMP2 in aorta and aortic valve. We hypothesize that (1) this repression is essential for controlling BMP2 levels in the adult and that (2) conditions such as aging and CKD impair the function of factors that mediate this repression in healthy heart valves and aorta. We will test these hypotheses in aged normal mice (24 months) and in the Klotho null mouse which models age-related disorders, including CKD. Klotho null mice suffer premature aging and death occurs at 7 - 8 weeks of age. At this time, extensive calcification of the heart valves, vasculature, and other soft tissues has occurred. AIM 1 is to test the influence of conditionally deleting a strong repressive element in the 3'untranslated region (UTR) of Bmp2 on calcification in normal aged mice and in Klotho null mice with premature aging and aging associated renal dysfunction. We will use recently developed Bmp2 alleles to assess how the deletion of this potent post-transcriptional repressor influences the course of calcification associated with aging and renal dysfunction. Preliminary results indicate that the UCS inhibits calcification. AIM 2 is to identify and compare miRNA signatures unique to young, healthy aorta and aortic valve to the signatures of these tissues from normal aged mice and in Klotho null mice with premature aging and severe vascular calcification. Within these profiles, we will focus on post- transcriptional repressive factors (miRNAs) that target the Bmp2 UCS and contribute to 3'UTR mediated repression in healthy tissues. AIM 3 is to test how selected and validated miRNAs influence the expression Bmp2 and downstream osteogenic events that lead to calcification in Klotho null mice bearing our unique transgenes. Our novel Bmp2 reporter mouse will expedite pre-clinical testing of miRNA therapies that prevent pathological calcification. Our newly developed Bmp2 allele (Aim 1) will differentiate changes due these miRNAs targeting Bmp2 relative to off-target genes. The outcomes of the proposed research will be (1) increased understanding of how BMP2 influences pathological calcification, (2) the identification and analyses of potential miRNA biomarkers, and (3) new therapeutic leads for controlling pathological calcification."
"9381138","A. Project Summary/Abstract Vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) is a reliable biomarker for studying the loss of cholinergic neurons and synapses. Cholinergic deficits are associated with impairment in memory, motor function and cognitive functions. A PET tracer for clinical imaging of VAChT will provide a critical noninvasive tool to measure cholinergic deficits and assess disease severity of patients with Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and other dementias. It can also be used to monitor the efficacy of cholinergic therapies in neurological diseases. Under our previously funded R01 for the discovery of PET imaging agents for imaging the VAChT, we developed [18F]VAT and [11C]TZ659. Both have high potency (Ki ? 1.0 nM) and selectivity for VAChT versus sigma receptors (>1000-fold) and showed promise in rodent and nonhuman primate studies. More importantly, by the end of the five year funding period, we completed imaging dosimetry studies in nonhuman primates, rodent toxicity studies, and the SOP for automated production of [18F]VAT in our cGMP facilities. Approval of our eIND, IRB and RDRC applications for [18F]VAT enabled a pilot PET imaging in eight healthy human subjects that demonstrated: (a) high reproducibility and reliability of [18F]VAT production in the cGMP facility; (b) no observable adverse effects in research subjects; (c) high specificity for the VAChT-enriched striatal region with target: non-target ratio of 6.0; and (d) favorable kinetic with high striatal accumulation 20 min post-injection, and rapid washout from non-target cerebellar hemispheres. Therefore, the goal of this R01 renewal is to focus on translational studies of [18F]VAT in healthy control subjects to provide key measures of radiation dosimetry, variability within and between subjects, age-dependence and sex-dependence. These validation studies will provide the basis for future investigations of pathologic conditions. In addition, we will use nonhuman primates pre-treated with a D2 dopamine receptor agonist or antagonist to investigate their impact on brain VAChT expression assessed by PET with [18F]VAT. Finally, we will determine the feasibility of quantitatively imaging VAChT in patients with PSP-RS and compare the in vivo PET findings to in vitro autoradiography studies using [3H]VAT for postmortem brain tissues from cases with autopsy proven PSP."
"9370841","PROJECT SUMMARY Napping is highly prevalent in the elderly, particularly in patients with Alzheimer's disease, but the longitudinal effects of napping on neurodegeneration are poorly understood. While growing evidence suggests that sleep disturbances lead to increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, it is unclear whether napping, as a crucial part of the 24-h sleep-wake cycle, could be as important a risk factor as nocturnal sleep for Alzheimer's disease. This Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) application by Dr. Yue Leng intends to fill this knowledge gap by building on her prior epidemiologic research that suggests associations between self-reported napping and risk of various adverse health outcomes in the elderly, and will provide Dr. Leng with further focused trainings to facilitate her transition into an independent researcher in the field of napping, sleep and cognitive aging. The research aims during the K99 phase are to determine the independent and longitudinal effects of actigraphy- measured napping on cognitive decline and risk of incident mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease, and to explore and elucidate potential mechanisms, including inflammation, oxidative stress, metabolic dysregulation and other comorbidities. Different dimensions of napping (i.e., intention, duration, frequency and timing) will also be explored and used to inform the development of a treatment program in R phase. This project will leverage data from two NIA-funded state-of-the-art prospective studies of aging, the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) Study and Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), both with 24-hour actigraphy recordings of napping and nocturnal sleep, widely used cognitive tests and serum biochemical measures. These research activities will be complemented by focused trainings in 1) etiology, diagnosis and management of Alzheimer's and other dementias; 2) interventional study design and conduct; and 3) aging- related sleep medicine. The training goals will be supervised by a multidisciplinary mentorship team, led by Dr. Kristine Yaffe, MD, Professor of Psychiatry, Neurology and Epidemiology. By the end of the training phase, Dr. Leng will develop expertise in sleep measurement and intervention to successfully transition into the R00 project, which aims to develop and pilot test a treatment program that incorporates bright light therapy and a modified cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-i) to improve 24-hour patterns of sleep in patients with MCI or mild Alzheimer's disease, with the ultimate aim of decreasing risk of Alzheimer's onset or progression. The combined 5-year research and training plan will allow Dr. Leng to establish an independent research program dedicated to the improvement of both sleep and aging outcomes. The current proposal will also specifically 1) advance knowledge about the effects of napping, an extremely common but understudied behavior in the elderly, on cognitive aging; 2) develop a novel sleep treatment program targeting patients with MCI; and 3) pilot a line of research on interventions of 24-h sleep patterns in order to improve cognitive outcomes and prevent Alzheimer's disease in high-risk population."
"9401853","Abstract Inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis represent aberrant or dysregulated immune responses of the gastrointestinal tract, which lead to a state of chronic inflammation. Recent discoveries have linked the gene encoding for interleukin-23 (IL-23) receptor with the development of Crohn's, and it is believed that IL-23 has a much larger effect on these inflammatory diseases, as well as affecting risk for both Crohn's and colitis. However, how IL-23 initiates intestinal inflammation remains unclear. Recent data have suggested that the pathogenic role of IL-23 is not only associated with its important role in expanding Th17 cells, but also in driving inflammation mediated by non-T cells. This subset of innate cells that responds to IL-23 and mediates colitis was identified both in mice and in humans, as a subset: group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) that express the transcriptional factor ROR?t. To determine whether the subsets of ILC3s that promote protective immunity infection are the same as the ones that promote colitis, we used mouse strains that lack certain subsets of ILC3s and evaluated their susceptibility to infection and to develop colitis. Our results suggested that the population of ILC3s that promotes protective immunity is absent in mice that lack the transcriptional factor AHR, whereas the subset of ILC3s that initiate colitis does not require AHR for its function or development. To identify which ones of ILCs promote colitis and the mechanisms by which these cells drive intestinal inflammation, we have generated a triple reporter mouse in which ILC3s that express the transcriptional ROR?t, IL-17 and IFN-g can be tracked in vivo. We believe that this novel cytokine reporter mouse will help us better understand the key role of ILC3s in the development of inflammatory diseases. These studies are needed before we can envision targeting these innate cells for therapeutic benefits."
"9526163","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Because electronic cigarettes deliver nicotine without burning tobacco, they may offer a valuable alternative for smokers who cannot break their nicotine addiction. However, little is known about electronic cigarette emissions or the health problems they produce. Our long-term objectives are to understand how electronic cigarettes affect human health and to contribute to the scientific foundation that will be used to establish rational policies for regulating the manufacture, advertisement, and sale of electronic cigarettes. Our Preliminary Data demonstrate high concentrations of metals and metal nanoparticles in aerosol from a leading brand of electronic cigarette. The goal of the proposed research is to identify and quantify the metal content of electronic cigarette aerosols from a broad spectrum of products and designs, to examine the cytoxicity and genotoxicity of aerosols with metal content, and to examine biomarkers of metal exposure and effect in human electronic cigarette users. In our first Specific Aim, we will identify and quantify metals in electronic cigarettes from various brands and styles and determine how metal concentrations correlate with electronic cigarette design. Metal quantification will be done using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Characterization of particle structure and size will be done using scanning and transmission electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) to identify elements. Metal concentrations in aerosol will be examined as a function of puffing topology. In the second Specific Aim, we will determine if aerosols with metals produce cytotoxic and genotoxic effects in human cells using the MTT and comet assays, in combination with a novel liver cell metabolizing assay. Human embryonic stem cells will be used to model an early stage of prenatal development and three dimensional human bronchial/epithelial tissue exposed at an air-liquid interface will be used to model human lung exposure. In Aims 1 and 2, metals in electronic cigarettes will be compared to metals in three popular brands of combustible cigarettes. In Aim #3, we will use metal biomarkers to quantify metal exposure and effect in humans who use electronic cigarettes, determine if metal uptake by cells includes nanoparticles, and determine whether metals migrate to the bloodstream and are excreted in the urine. Our project will generate new data on: (1) the metal content of electronic cigarette aerosols across a broad spectrum of evolving products, (2) the cyto/genotoxicity of the metals in electronic cigarette aerosols, (3) the sensitivity of embryonic and differentiated adult lung cells to electronic cigarette aerosol metals, and (4) the absorption, excretion, and the biological effects of metals in human electronic cigarette users. These data, the first of their kind, will contribute to a foundation of science upon which the FDA can develop regulatory policies to protect consumers' health and minimize future public health problems."
"9323727","ABSTRACT Innate-like B cell-derived natural antibodies (NAbs) against T-independent polysaccharide (PS) and phospholipid epitopes are universally present in mammals and serve important roles in the protection against many bacterial pathogens. However robust antibody responses against PS antigens following infection or immunization are absent in neonates. We previously showed that neonatal exposure to PS and phospholipid antigens by immunization or natural colonization with the microbiota, influences the clonal distribution of antigen-specific innate-like B cells leading to quantitative increases in natural antibody (Nab) levels. These effects impact adult susceptibility to infection, and immune-responsiveness to allergens and auto antigens bearing similar B cell epitopes. Although the microbiota impacts the development of other lymphoid lineages its role in the development of the adult innate-like B cell and NAb repertoires is largely unexplored. Our hypothesis is that in addition to the well-described selection processes that occur during B cell development, the accessibility to autologous antigens and exogenous commensal-derived epitopes combine during neonatal development to shape the natural repertoire. The goal of these proposed studies is to elucidate mechanisms of exogenous antigen-directed development of the innate-like B cell repertoire using three model B cell antigen- specificities that represent epitopes for relevant pathogenic and commensal organisms with a spectrum of auto antigenic potential: phosphorylcholine (PC), N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc), and dextran (DEX). In Aim 1 of these studies wild-type gnotobiotic mice will be colonized with defined microbiota to assess the contribution of exogenous antigen signaling on clonal B cell development and formation of the NAb repertoire. Bone marrow chimera systems, composed of antigen-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain-transgenic mouse strains, and lineage tracking will enable assessment of endogenous and exogenous antigen signaling on B lymphocyte selection and receptor editing processes. In Aim 2 we will analyze the frequency, cell surface phenotype, subset and isotype distribution as well as immunoglobulin gene usage of human B cells specific for these antigens. Examination of B cells isolated from cord blood, tonsils/adenoids, and peripheral blood B cells of donors of different ages will provide novel insight into the role of antigen experience in the formation of innate- like B cell repertoire diversity within and across individuals. Antigen-specific Ig genes will be cloned and expressed as recombinant antibody to determine effects of antigen-driven maturation on functions of these human antibodies. Collectively, these studies will define the microbial influences on NAb development in mice, determine developmental kinetics of human NAb development, and compare and contrast the NAb repertoire development between both species. This insight into the human infant responses to infection and colonization will advance our long-term goal of developing effective neonatal vaccine strategies and interventional therapies that provide protection from infectious pathogens and allergic and autoimmune diseases."
"9501680","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Periodontal infection has been shown to increase the incidence and severity of atherosclerosis, which is now the number one cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Furthermore there is increasing evidence linking obesity, which is a major risk factor of atherosclerosis, to periodontal disease. In atherosclerosis, the earliest lesions contain macrophages that have phagocytized and accumulated modified lipoproteins. The continued monocyte recruitment and cholesterol accumulation in the vessel wall facilitates chronic disease progression. The identification of several subsets of microRNAs involved in vascular repair and homeostasis have made them an attractive target for atherosclerosis research. Recent studies have identified miR-126 as an essential mediator of vascular integrity and angiogenesis through its regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor 1 signaling, and modulation of vascular adhesion proteins to control leukocyte traffic across the vessel wall. In atherosclerosis related pathology, it was shown to reduce the size of the vascular lesions by activation of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis to mobilize and incorporate endothelial progenitor cells at the site of injury. Since macrophages derived from bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), are key to the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis, the therapeutic potential of over-expressing beneficial genes and/or knocking-down detrimental genes in macrophages, or using the macrophage as a delivery mechanism is gaining attention in the gene therapy field. Our hypothesis is that over-expression of miR-126 in macrophages will mediate atheroprotection by reducing atherosclerosis plaque formation and increasing plaque stability. Through the use of our synthetic macrophage promote, our lab has previously been able utilize the macrophage as a delivery mechanism for Liver X receptor alpha and Brain-derived neurotrophic factor in atherosclerosis and neurodegeneration studies respectively. The goal of this study is to determine 1) if macrophages can successful deliver miR-126 to the vascular endothelium, 2) If delivery of miR-126 to the vessel wall protects the endothelium thereby decreasing atherosclerotic lesions and 3) if this protection/decrease in lesion is mediated by the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis. Answering these questions will be important for advancing the use of vascular gene therapy in a clinical setting and uncovering alternative approaches to vascular regeneration and remodeling. This research proposal supports training necessary for the applicant's career goal to become a dentist-scientist studying translational research in regenerative dentistry."

"9355673","  ABSTRACT The objective of the Human Clinical Phenotyping Core (Core B, HCP) is to promote excellence in human phenotyping, with a central mission to facilitate research on intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs) by a diverse interdisciplinary team of investigators across the Einstein/Montefiore campuses. To this end the HCP provides recruitment and sophisticated human phenotyping services for IDDRC investigators (Aim 1). The HCP implements an extensive program of community outreach and recruitment to increase diversity in research on intellectual and developmental disabilities and expose local children to the wonders of science and research (Aim 2). The HCP maintains an extensive and actively growing database of potential research participants (Aim 3) that, in addition to including participant characteristics and clinical and cognitive assessment results, records the presence of neuroimaging data and genetics samples for that participant (Aim 4). This database serves to reduce recruitment and phenotyping costs for investigators, ease the burden of participation for families, and minimize redundant testing efforts across different research groups. De-identified participant information is readily available to IDDRC investigators through this centralized database. The HCP also provides IDDRC members access to state-of-the-art human neuroimaging resources (Aim 5) and engages in the development of next-generation phenotyping tools (Aim 6). Since its inauguration 5-years ago, the HCP has become an integral part of human IDD work at Einstein/Montefiore. For example, it is essential to Einstein's role in an `Autism Centers of Excellence Network' project on the genetics of autism in African Americans (ACE, P50, MH100027), plays a key role in a recently initiated randomized clinical trial testing efficacy of two behavioral interventions on ASD (R01 HD082814), and has been vital to a number of clinical- research partnerships (including on RETT syndrome and NPC type C disease). Over the next 5-years the HCP will continue to support these interwoven aims to promote the mission of the RFK IDDRC to advance diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of children with IDDs. In addition, it will serve the proposed IDDRC research project by recruiting and phenotyping 22q11.2 deletion syndrome participants (Aim 7). Through these aims the HCP will maintain its role as the central hub for a variety of Center investigators for whom comprehensive human phenotyping is key to understanding the implications of their work."
"9321929","Abstract Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a revolutionary tool that allows us to address scientific questions that were elusive just a few years ago. Specifically, the scRNA-seq technology has the potential to enable insights into how a single cell develops into a complex organism, how cell-to-cell variation functions to maintain homeostasis, and how diseases such as cancer develop resistance to treatment. Unfortunately, much of this potential has yet to be realized as statistical methods to analyze scRNA-seq data are lacking. For many types of analyses, the methods currently in use obscure and, in some cases, distort biological signals. A number of statistical and computational challenges must be addressed to prevent inaccurate conclusions, and to optimize novel discovery. This proposal addresses those challenges. In particular, we propose normalization methods to adjust scRNA-seq data for artifacts and thereby ensure robust and accurate downstream inference. We also propose statistical methods to characterize and remove variability induced by oscillatory genes which can mask effects under study. By de-noising the data, these methods will improve the power with which signals of interest can be studied. Finally, we propose methods for identifying cell sub-populations and characterizing their differences across biological conditions. These types of methods are required for identifying novel sub-populations and for characterizing the ways in which cell- specific expression changes in response to various environments. Successful completion of the project will help to ensure that maximal information is obtained from powerful scRNA-seq experiments."
"9532340","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Brown fat can reduce obesity through the dissipation of calories as heat. Recently, a link has been identified between exercise and thermogenesis. We identified interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) as a dominant transcriptional regulator of the thermogenic gene expression program in response to cold. In this application, we hypothesize that IRF4 plays a similar role in exercise-induced thermogenesis. The objective of this application is to determine the mechanisms by which IRF4 exerts its actions at the molecular, cellular and organismal levels. We will accomplish this goal of this proposal by using the tissue-specific IRF4 knockout and overexpression mice as well as in vitro studies. This study will further identify and characterize whether IRF4 participates in the exercise-mediated thermogenesis and the role of IRF4 in muscle in regulating energy homeostasis. Eventually, we believe that the detailed study of IRF4 in the context of metabolism will yield critical insights tat can be exploited therapeutically in the fight against obesity and T2D."
"9344609","Project Summary The mission of the Washington University Center for Diabetes Translation Research (WU-CDTR) is to eliminate disparities in diabetes by translating, disseminating, implementing, and sustaining evidence-based research findings into real-world settings. The WU-CDTR is located at an outstanding institution that continues as the intellectual home to an exceptional group of investigators conducting rigorous translational research focused around two interacting scientific themes: (1) the root causes of diabetes disparities, and (2) the prevention of obesity as a major contributing cause of Type 2 diabetes. The WU-CDTR has evolved to become a ?network of networks?, with investigators affiliated through a regional resource core with the University of Missouri at Columbia, and two health disparity population cores with the National Congress of American Indians, and the African American Collaborative Obesity Research Network. The WU-CDTR fosters transdisciplinary collaborations, catalyzes new ideas, and supports investigators through six research cores led by national experts in their respective fields that provide distinctive but complementary scientific expertise to inform research with populations at risk for disparities, including: (1) the Dissemination and Implementation in Diabetes Research Core, which advances the study of dissemination and implementation science in diabetes research; (2) the Policy and Systems Science Analysis in Diabetes Research Core, which advances the study of policy- and system-level interventions in diabetes research; (3) the Health Communication and Health Literacy Core, which advances the study of health communication science to test strategies for addressing health disparities in diabetes research; (4) the Health Informatics in Diabetes Research Core, which advances the development and application of healthcare informatics in translational diabetes research; (5) the Research Partnerships with American Indian/Alaska Native Communities Core, which increases the capacity of researchers to engage in translational research with American Indian and Alaska Native communities; and (6) the Solutions to Diabetes in Black Americans Core, which provides methodological and content expertise to support research with the Black population. The WU-CDTR supports a vibrant Pilot and Feasibility Program designed to attract and retain new investigators as well as established investigators new to the field; and it also supports an Enrichment Program that promotes transdisciplinary research, learning opportunities, and mentorship for young investigators. Evidence that the WU-CDTR has been successful in pursuing the mission includes a record of outstanding productivity reflected by publications and funding in diabetes and related research. Success is also measured by the growth of our research base of established and new diabetes investigators, and underrepresented racial minority investigators. The WU-CDTR is positioned as the nexus for transdisciplinary team science and transformative diabetes research addressing multiple dimensions of diabetes disparities."
"9381810","Status epilepticus (SE) is a common neurological emergency associated with high morbidity and mortality. While benzodiazepines are an effective first-line therapy for many patients with SE, evidence is lacking to guide treatment when drugs in this group fail. The Established Status Epilepticus Treatment Trial (ESETT), which is underway, is a randomized, blinded, response-adaptive study whose objective is to identify the most effective treatment for children and adults with convulsive SE refractory to standard dose of a benzodiazepine defined as established SE (ESE). ESETT is comparing three drugs: fosphenytoin (FOS), valproic acid (VPA), and levetiracetam (LVT). The primary outcome is clinical cessation of status epilepticus, determined by the absence of clinically apparent seizures and improving responsiveness, at 60 minutes after the start of study drug infusion, without the use of additional anti-seizure medications. However, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these three drugs, when used for ESE, are poorly understood. ESETT offers a unique opportunity to investigate drug exposure-response relationships. The specific aim of this ancillary study is to relate drug exposure (partial area under the curve, pAUC, from time 0 to 60 min after start of drug infusion) with the ESETT primary outcome and key secondary outcomes measures. The following hypotheses will be tested:  Hypothesis 1: Patients with higher drug exposures (pAUC based on unbound or total plasma concentrations  of FOS, VPA and LEV) will more likely respond to treatment.  Hypothesis 2: Patients with higher drug exposures (pAUC) will have a higher incidence of adverse effects  commonly associated with the study drugs.  Hypothesis 3: The relationship between drug exposure and response will differ by gender, age group, and  weight or BMI. While ESETT will identify the most or least effective clinical choice overall, this ancillary study will elucidate reasons for response and non-response. Further, an understanding of the exposure-response relationships will allow evidence-based guidance on how best to use these medications in patient care. Lastly, information from this ancillary study can guide future clinical trials as new agents are tested against the best drug or drugs that is/are ultimately determined by ESETT. Thus, this study will impact clinical practice and future ESE investigations."
"9395373","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Persons with opioid use disorder (OUD) have longer and more expensive hospitalizations (over $15 billion annually) than general hospital admissions. Despite the magnitude of this issue, little research describes hospital use of evidence-based opioid agonist treatments (OATs). I propose to assess hospital variation, model associations with patient and hospital attributes, and explore hospital structures influencing OAT delivery in the context of local and broader environments. There are three OAT (continuation of pre-hospital OAT, OAT for withdrawal management, and OAT initiation for long-term care) and three non-OAT (short-acting opioids, symptom management medications, and other care) OUD care scenarios. I will measure patient disposition and 30-day readmissions for each care scenario. This study leverages health service delivery conceptual frameworks and a multilevel change model using a mixed methods approach. The study addresses two quantitative aims (analysis of OUD hospital admissions in the Premier Healthcare Database) and one qualitative aim (interviews with 20 hospital key informants from a purposive sample of 10 to 12 hospitals). Specific Aim 1. Assess variation in hospital OAT delivery and test the associations of OAT and non- OAT care scenarios with attributes and outcomes. I will evaluate whether meaningful variation exists in hospital OAT delivery and whether patient attributes (e.g., gender), hospital attributes (e.g., size) and patient outcomes (e.g., disposition) are associated with the provision of OAT in the hospital. H1a: Measurable differences exist among hospital OAT quartiles and between top and bottom OAT quartiles. H1b: Hospital OAT quartiles will be associated with at least one patient attribute, one hospital attribute, and one patient outcome domain. Specific Aim 2. Model and test the proposed relationships of patient and hospital attributes on hospital OAT delivery and patient outcomes. I will use multilevel modeling to identify specific associations of patient (e.g., race) and hospital (e.g., teaching status) attributes with hospital OAT variation, patient outcomes, and between-hospital variation. H2a: OAT delivery will be negatively associated with patient race (non-white), insurance status (uninsured), and hospital teaching status (non-teaching). H2b: In-hospital mortality and 30-day readmissions will be negatively associated with hospital OAT delivery. Specific Aim 3. Use qualitative interviews with key hospital informants to explore the environmental context and hospital structures that may mediate hospital OAT delivery. Findings from Aims 1 and 2 guide the purposive sampling and interview protocol for the key informant interviews. I will probe for local hospital (e.g., addiction medicine fellowship) and broader environmental contextual factors (e.g., federal policy) that may influence hospital structures (e.g., formulary) impeding or facilitating hospital OAT delivery."
"9320737","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Long Life Family Study (LLFS), established in 2005 in response to an NIA RFA, enrolled families enriched for exceptional longevity (EL), to discover factors that contribute to healthy aging and survival. From 2006 to 2009, LLFS enrolled 539 sibships (G1), their offspring (G2) and spouses (total 4,953). Comparison with a referent cohort reveals that LLFS families have strong exceptional clustering of EL. The G2 offspring have a variety of Healthy Aging Phenotypes (HAPs), defined as an unusually low age-specific prevalence of one or more specific conditions or risk factors, compared to population-based cohorts suggesting enrichment of shared (possibly genetic) protective effects in LLFS families. In the second funding period (2010-2013), we conducted a 2.5 million SNP GWAS (dbGaP phs000397); developed a high-throughput technique and sequenced ~450 candidate genes and replicated many variants and found additional ones associated with Healthy Aging Phenotypes (HAP) and longevity. 54% of LLFS G1 and 92% of G2 remain alive. Participant retention has been 94%. We now propose a third funding period to conduct a second in-person examination (V2) to prospectively study rates of change in HAPs with age and identify genetic and other factors contributing to HAPs and longevity. We hypothesize that EL and HAPs entail common and rare variants that individually have modest effects, but which in combinations strongly influence longevity and specific HAPs, and may only be detectable in family studies enriched for HAPs, such as LLFS. HAPs evaluated at the initial in-person visit show strong linkage peaks which are not explained by common haplotypes interrogated by GWAS (HLODs ranging from 6.0-45.1). These are likely driven by rare, lineage-private alleles that will only be found by sequencing specific families, and may point to important new biology. Specific Aim 1 is to conduct a second in-home examination on all surviving LLFS participants. Specific Aim 2 is to analyze cross-sectional and longitudinal phenotypes. The goal is to identify pathways for EL and HAPs by characterizing the shared and distinct LLFS phenotypes and environmental factors. We will characterize individual longitudinal patterns of HAPs to identify subgroups showing similar patterns and exceptional phenotypes. We will test whether these HAPs are heritable, and test for differences with internal and external referent groups. Specific Aim 3 is to find genes/variants associated with cross-sectional and longitudinal phenotypes using a) Whole Exome Sequencing to comprehensively search for coding variants associated with HAPs and EL and b) Targeted Regulatory Sequencing of regions under linkage peaks for HAPs in selected families showing the strongest linkage evidence. Specific Aim 4 is to replicate our genetic and epidemiological findings in other aging study cohorts. This study could lead to the discovery of pathways and potential therapeutic/prevention targets affecting HAPs and EL. A Data Management and Coordinating Center and 4 Field Centers comprise the major components of the LLFS. This renewal application is submitted by the Duke Uni./Uni. of Southern Denmark Field Center."
"9368542","ABSTRACT Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most frequent form of arthritis and a common cause of disability. While OA affects millions of people in the United States alone, joint replacement is generally the only available treatment when the pain and disability of the disease become too great. Advances in OA research and clinical care have been greatly hindered by a lack of sensitive biomarkers and by the absence of analysis methods for detecting such biomarkers in some existing large datasets, such as the dataset of the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI). The magnetic resonance image (MRI) dataset of the OAI contains extremely valuable longitudinal image data from more than 4,000 subjects collected over an 8-year period. While cartilage loss is believed to be the dominating factor in OA, to date cartilage segmentations are publicly available for only about 1% of the images of the OAI dataset. This severely limits research on knee cartilage changes and their relation to outcome measures. Obtaining image-based cartilage biomarkers for the full dataset is difficult, as most existing analysis approaches are at best semi-automated. A key challenge is that the existing approaches do not scale to large datasets: neither financially (such analysis would cost millions of dollars) nor from a practical point of view ? e.g., manually segmenting cartilage would likely require a decade of full-time work by one individual. The aim of this project is two-fold: 1) We will invent advanced image-analysis and statistical approaches which will allow for truly large-scale analysis of the OAI MRI dataset, i.e., will allow us to analyze the full OAI dataset. These approaches will include methods to automatically segment and characterize knee cartilage and to assess differences between subjects and across time. All our analysis software will be made available in open-source form to the public, free to use for anybody. We will support custom compute clusters, cloud- and parallel computing. 2) By facilitating large-scale analysis of the entire dataset, the proposed approaches will allow us to revisit many important clinical questions left open by gaps in prior methods. In particular, standard radiographic outcome measures for OA progression (based on Kellgren-Lawrence grade and/or joint space narrowing) have low reliability, are difficult to interpret, and respond poorly to change. We will therefore explore local cartilage thickness as a measure for OA progression and its associations with putative risk factors of OA, which (contrary to expectation) have only shown limited, conflicting, or inconclusive associations with radiographic measures. We will also investigate the prediction of long-term OA progression from short-term cartilage characteristics, which could help identify individuals at highest risk of rapid cartilage loss. Once identified, these individuals could then be targeted for more aggressive therapy or for clinical trials."

The primary aim of the NEC is to leverage standard and cutting edge neurobehavioral and cognitive approaches to further our understanding of healthy and diseased brain anatomy, function, and pathophysiology. In order to realize this goal, measurement of neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes is a crucial endpoint for studies of both atypical and typical development. The aims of the studies supported by the NEC, therefore, focus on developmental, cognitive, and behavioral outcomes in animal models of IDD and in children who have a variety of neurogenetic, neurodevelopmental, or acquired neurological disorders. Furthermore, advancement in the diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and amelioration of IDD is maximized through a multi-level, translational, approach that progresses from preclinical (animal) to human studies. Overall, the goal of the NEC is to guide investigators to use neurobehavioral/cognitive testing to assist in defining specific, yet complex, neurobehavioral and neuropsychological processes. Aims of the NEC are to: AIM 1: Provide services at a level appropriate to individual projects including maximizing test and technology development; AIM 2: Provide individual and group education and training to the DC-IDDRC community; and AIM 3: Promote and facilitate Core collaboration across projects. The importance of the NEC is to employ measures that link the underlying mechanisms of neurological disorders with behavioral and cognitive developmental outcomes. The NEC affords DC-IDDRC investigators access to a robust platform to improve access to state- of-the-art neurobehavioral and cognitive tools and to enhance the overall quality of preclinical and clinical neurobehavioral research being conducted throughout the DC-IDDRC. In addition, the Core improves efficiency by providing access to expert personnel and/or testing materials that maximize cost effectiveness."

By utilizing a skills-based innovative program to educate Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs), this proposal will equip and expand the nursing workforce to meet a critical need for palliative care in oncology. The Specific Aims are: Specific Aim 1: Adapt the ELNEC (End-of-Life Nursing Education Consortium) Advanced Practice Nursing curriculum to train oncology nurses as generalist palliative care providers and leaders. Specific Aim 2: Deliver the curriculum in national workshops to competitively selected oncology APRNs from National Cancer Institute-designated clinical and comprehensive cancer centers, as well as community cancer centers. Specific Aim 3: Evaluate the impact of the curriculum by measuring the process and outcomes of participants' integrating the training to advance palliative care practices at their institutions. Specific Aim 4: Disseminate findings through peer-reviewed publications, oncology organizations, and professional networks, and develop a network of course participants to share experiences in integrating palliative care at participating cancer centers. Over the last 15 years, rigorous research has amassed a body of evidence documenting palliative care benefits for cancer patients and their families and identifying opportunities to improve cancer patient care. Despite proven benefits, there is often no system in place to provide concurrent palliative and oncology care and cancer patients often decline palliative care, even when it is available. Previous systematic reviews have highlighted the need to train oncology professionals to deliver palliative care. This innovative program focuses on APRNs in cancer centers, who are models of leadership and best care available for patients. These nurses can serve as palliative care generalists to collaborate with specialty palliative care. A total of 500 participants from cancer centers will participate in one of five courses. "
"9323376","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is for the Continuation of the Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network (NASH CRN) - Data Coordinating Center. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects one out of every three adults and five children in North America and is a growing public health issue in the United States. NAFLD, and especially nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), may lead to end-stage liver disease and primary liver cancer, as well as liver-, cardiovascular-, and cancer-related mortality, resulting in major increases in health burdens and costs. The NASH CRN is ideally and uniquely positioned to impact the growing public health significance of NASH that can only be addressed via a larger research consortium. The primary objective of the NASH CRN is to perform clinical research on NASH and NAFLD in adults and children. A closely linked and high priority secondary objective is to conduct translational research in NASH and NAFLD focusing on the pathogenesis that will provide the basis for understanding the natural history and developing means of better diagnosis, treatment, and clinical management. In the next phase of the NASH CRN, the adult and pediatric therapeutic trials initiated during the previous funding cycle will be completed, and new therapeutic trials, including phase 2a proof of mechanism and phase 2b clinical trials will be initiated, to develop evidence-based treatment options that are safe, effective, simple, and inexpensive. The longitudinal cohort of adults and children with NAFLD will be extended, which will prospectively define the natural history of the disease, the cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors, and will aid in biomarker discovery and validation, and development and validation of non-invasive techniques to evaluate and identify those with NASH/NAFLD, who will respond, and how quickly the disease is progressing. Duke University will provide the NASH CRN with expert basic science and clinical-translational expertise in NAFLD, the ability to readily recruit adults and children into prospective clinical trials, and perform ancillary studies to fill existin gaps in knowledge.

"9269205","This TRD, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) and Multinuclear Imaging, has been actively involved in the development and evaluation of in vivo MRS and spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) technology for both protons (1H) and other nuclei from the founding of the CAMRTS P41 Research Resource Center in 1995 to the present. While some of our recent metabolic imaging studies involved a variety of organs including kidney, heart, and liver, our primary effort during the prior funding cycle was on the development of novel methods for measuring brain neurotransmitter levels and neurometabolic processes. Under this competitive renewal, we propose to build upon our successes in brain imaging technology with important refinements needed to translate hyperpolarized 13C MRSI techniques from animal to human applications, improve 1H MRS measures of steady-state neurotransmitter levels, and provide previously unavailable regional measures of neuroenergetic and neurotransmitter cycling rates throughout the human brain. These choices are based on meeting the current and future needs of collaborative projects ?Metabolic Therapy of GBM guided by MRS of hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate? (PI: Lawrence Recht, Stanford University), ?1H MRS of GABA, Glu, and Gln? [PI: Brian Wandell, Stanford University), and Neuroimaging of Alcoholism (PI: Adolf Pfefferbaum, SRI International). Specifically, in vivo MRSI offers non-invasive identification, visualization, and quantification of brain biochemical markers and neurotransmitters, the assessment of abnormalities in injured or diseased brain tissue, the longitudinal monitoring of degenerative diseases, and the early evaluation of therapeutic interventions. 1H MRS is able to measure steady-state levels of GABA, glutamate (Glu), and glutamine (Glu), and infusion of 13C labeled substrates permits the measurement of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and neurotransmitter cycling rates. Furthermore, the ongoing development of hyperpolarized agents, i.e., MRIvisible compounds whose magnetization is four orders of magnitude higher than that normally achieved at in vivo temperatures, presents unprecedented opportunities to noninvasively monitor critical dynamic metabolic processes under both normal and pathologic conditions. New MRS technology will be developed in accordance with the following Specific Aims: 1) to develop optimized pulse sequences and hardware for clinical hyperpolarized 13C studies of the human brain and glioma treatment response, 2) to develop improved 1H MRS GABA, Glu, and Gln editing methods to robustly measure steady-state neurotransmitter levels throughout the human brain free from overlapping macromolecular resonances that limit current methods, and 3) to develop indirect-detection 1H-13C techniques to measure TCA and Glu/Gln cycling rates throughout the human brain."

"9289152","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Defects in the assembly and maintenance of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) machinery lead to a range of degenerative illnesses, including diabetes, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. OXPHOS complexes are encoded on both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, so their biogenesis requires the precise coordination of gene regulatory mechanisms across genomes. To this end, mitochondrial biogenesis and stress response programs involve the simultaneous transcriptional upregulation of nuclear- encoded OXPHOS genes and mitochondrial gene expression factors. These transcriptional programs are thought to facilitate nuclear-mitochondrial balance, where mitochondrial-encoded OXPHOS subunits assemble in stoichiometric ratios with their nuclear-encoded counterparts. We recently observed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that transcription regulation of nuclear-encoded and mitochondrial-encoded OXPHOS subunits are not coordinated during carbon source adaptation. Instead, the cell synchronizes the translational regulation of OXPHOS subunits across compartments. Whether synchronized translation is a widespread response remains unknown. The goal of this proposal is to determine how mitochondrial and nuclear genomes are co-regulated, particularly during protein synthesis, throughout mitochondrial biogenesis and stress response programs. As an extension of our recent work in yeast, Aim 1 will investigate whether synchronous translation programs occur across a range of environmental and mitochondrial stress adaptation programs. We will also determine how the synchronous translation regulation occurs by determining the role of key mitochondrial translation regulators in the dynamic regulation of OXPHOS genes during carbon source adaptation. This will be done using our mitochondrial ribosome profiling approach and cytosolic ribosome profiling to measure protein synthesis and RNA-seq to measure global transcription. In Aims 2 and 3, we extend our studies to human cells through re-engineering ribosome profiling to robustly capture human mitochondrial translation. To test the approach, we will investigate how a putative translation activator, TACO1, impacts human mitochondrial translation. We will investigate nuclear-mitochondrial co-regulation after acute mitochondrial stress induced by chemical inhibition of OXPHOS complexes, mimicking OXPHOS dysfunction in disease processes. Finally, we will investigate mitochondrial and nuclear gene expression programs during the in vitro differentiation of iPS cells to cardiomyocytes, when extensive mitochondrial biogenesis occurs. Determining the regulation and the extent of nuclear-mitochondrial co-regulation will provide critical insight towards understanding how imbalanced production of OXPHOS subunits transpires in disease states."
"9396432","Project Summary Sleep regulation plays a critical role in proper neurological development. During sleep, there is enhanced synaptic plasticity in the nervous system in addition to often extensive neural remodeling. Although we know that sleep regulation is important to neurological development, many aspects of sleep regulation are poorly understood. In particular, the mechanisms of how we compensate for missed sleep in future sleep cycles are mysterious, despite general knowledge of how circadian rhythms are established. It is likely that these mechanisms involve neuropeptide signaling in the brain. However, current tools to study the roles these peptides play in sleep homeostasis, even with the use of simple model organisms like C. elegans, are low- throughput, qualitative, and subjective. In order to study sleep-like behavior in C. elegans, there is an unmet need for a tool for continuously monitoring and perturbing long-term behavior of the worm, as well as an automated and un-biased method for quantifying behavioral data. In this proposal, we will first develop the enabling technology, and use it to identify the roles of neuropeptides in homeostasis of the nematode?s sleep- like state. In Aim I, we will engineer and validate a scalable microscopy platform for monitoring and perturbing C. elegans behavior, decreasing the cost of long-term candidate screens by ~ 100 fold. In Aim 2, we will quantify behavior of wild-type animals via an automated and bias-free quantitative analysis to establish baseline behavior and prioritize behaviors that are linked to sleep homeostasis. In Aim 3, we will use the technology developed in Aims I and 2 to quantify differences in behavior of C. elegans neuropeptide mutants using a candidate approach. Because of the strong preliminary data we have gathered so far and the experience of the sponsor?s laboratory, this proposed work is likely to identify the roles of these candidate neuropeptides in sleep homeostasis, contributing to our mechanistic understanding of sleep regulation. Furthermore, the tools we develop for this particular study will also have broad utilities in many other problems, such as developmental programming, aging, and neurobehavioral studies."

Without thorough understanding of these aspects, effective strategies to reduce agricultural HRI are diminished. This multidisciplinary effort brings together investigators from medicine, epidemiology, public health, physiology, anthropology and community outreach/education who are uniquely positioned to address HRI in agricultural populations. Our goal is to obtain novel data on internal body temperature as it relates to crop type and geography, external heat and internal metabolic loading, including accounting for work type and personal factors. Our innovative approach will obtain critical information on knowledge, work practices and social-cultural issues that impact a worker's decisions with regard to HRI prevention. By combining these approaches, we aim to develop protective strategies to be translated and broadcast through outreach and education programs. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) Increase understanding of the physiological responses to increased environmental heat and physical exertion among farmworkers through the analyses of personal characteristics, monitors and sensors, and use the protocols developed to generate and validate risk models. 2) Examine socio-cultural perspectives of HRI using focus groups and key interviews, and identify barriers to adoption of prevention strategies and potential solutions acceptable to all parties. (3) Assess normal practices of farmworkers that impact HRI risk using epidemiological techniques. (4) Increase awareness of HRI as a credible personal risk to farmworkers, and translate project findings into HRI prevention strategies."
"9358312","Project 3 addresses two approaches to inducing human immune tolerance to the pig, namely mixed xenogeneic chimerism and porcine thymic transplantation, in a humanized (HU) mouse model. We have demonstrated that each approach can centrally tolerize human T cells to the donor pig and we hypothesize that the combination of both approaches will ultimately be optimal. During the current funding period, we have obtained evidence that mixed xenogeneic chimerism leads to specific tolerance or global unresponsiveness of human NK cells. We have obtained evidence that mixed xenogeneic chimerism tolerizes human T cell- independent B cells producing anti-pig xenoantibodies. We have shown that human T cells developing in human and porcine thymus grafts are functional and dependent on human APCs in the periphery for homeostasis. Human T cells developing in porcine thymus grafts, while tolerant of the donor pig, have reduced homeostatic expansion and reduced responses to antigen presented by HLA. We hypothesize that such abnormalities may be corrected while optimal protective immunity and tolerance to the pig and the human will be achieved by injecting autologous thymic epithelial cells (TECs) into the porcine thymic graft and combining transplantation of this ?hybrid? thymus with mixed xenogeneic chimerism. We will: 1) Engineer a pig/human ?hybrid? thymus to mediate positive and negative selection of human T cells on both pig and human MHC molecules. We will evaluate the impact of a pig/human TEC-containing hybrid thymus and of mixed xenogeneic chimerism on tolerance, homeostasis and function of human T cells. These studies will be directly relevant to the baboon studies in Project 1 and are expected to achieve optimal tolerance and protective immunity; and 2) Determine the impact of duration of mixed xenogeneic chimerism on tolerance of human T, B and NK cells to the pig. We will determine the extent to which human CD47 expression on pig bone marrow prevents pig bone marrow rejection by human macrophages and enhances porcine chimerism in HU mice. We will then separately examine the impact of the duration of chimerism on the persistence of T cell, B cell and NK cell tolerance. We will examine the mechanism of persistent T cell tolerance if observed after loss of chimerism. We will also determine the impact of duration of mixed xenogeneic chimerism on human NK cell tolerance and of transgenic expression of HLA-E by pig bone marrow cells on induction of mixed chimerism in HU mice and on tolerance and function of human NK cells. Collectively, the studies will continue to guide the tolerance studies in Projects 1 and 2 and the development of optimal transgenic pigs in Project 4."
"9505132","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although infection of the dental pulp induces a periapical lesion, the course of this disease is also affected by host factors. For example long duration diabetics exhibited teeth with larger periapical lesions than short duration diabetics and healthy controls. To date, the relationships between bacterial pathogens/pathogen- associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and the host immune system have been extensively investigated. However involvement of host-derived danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which are released by damaged cells, in periapical lesions is unknown. In our preliminary studies, SAA3 (Serum Amyloid A3), which is a DAMP, was the most highly up-regulated gene in rodent periapical lesions, and the SAA3 protein was strongly expressed in mouse periapical lesions. Systemic SAA levels are significantly elevated in a mouse diet-induced obesity model (DIO), in which animals develop pre-diabetes and steatosis (fatty liver) vs. control mice, indicating an association of SAA with obesity- induced systemic inflammation. In addition, infected DIO mice exhibited elevated serum SAA and had larger periapical lesions compared to controls, suggesting a pathologic link between SAA and periapical lesion severity. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that SAA, produced in response to dental infections, exacerbates dentoalveolar bone destruction, and furthermore contributes to systemic inflammation and its sequellae in obesity/type 2 diabetes. We propose that SAA is the primary DAMP in periapical lesions, and is a key enhancer of dentoalveolar inflammation. SAA is therefore an innovative target in modulating oral infection and inflammation. We will pursue the role of SAA in periapical lesions in the following three specific aims: AIM 1: To assess the role of SAAs in periapical lesions using SAA knockout (KO) and overexpression mouse models. Aim 2: To identify the functional receptors and signaling pathways for SAAs. AIM 3: To determine whether obesity-diabetes ('diabesity') alters periapical inflammation via SAAs."
"9410228","ABSTRACT The agrarian political regime of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia led to the death of nearly 2 million civilians and residual symptoms of distress among many survivors. Recent estimates indicate that nearly 50% of the general population exhibits clinically significant symptoms of trauma-related anxiety and/or depression. Targeting of academic leaders during the genocide further undermined an already vulnerable academic health system needed to support innovations in mental health research and care. Cambodian leadership is committed to resolving the existing mental health gap through strategic partnerships, enhanced capacity building, and adoption of evidence-based treatments (EBT) capable of shifting the trajectory of health and wellness of the population. This application follows on the heels of a successful Phase I program culminating in a clear vision of capacity building needs and national research priorities with high potential for local adoption, scale-up, and sustainability. The proposed application will enrich outcomes from the first phase through completion of three layered and integrated aims. Specific Aim 1 will strengthen the mental health research capacity across performance sites utilizing a combination of standardized content for global mental health and professional development programs tailored for research in Cambodia. Measurable outcomes will support the conceptualization, implementation, and evaluation of externally funded research projects resulting in high impact scientific publications. Specific Aim 2 will examine the acceptability and feasibility of trauma-informed care as a culturally relevant response to trauma exposure. Newly trained and certified research teams led by Cambodian investigators will employ a mixed methods design to evaluate the Missouri Model of trauma-informed care. Specific Aim 3 will determine the effectiveness of a culturally-informed, EBT to reduce symptoms of trauma- related anxiety, depression, and problematic substance use. Preliminary work suggests that the Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA), a task-sharing EBT has high potential to improve affective disorders and substance use disorders in resource restricted environments. However, studies have only examined CETA administered with ongoing supervision by US-based clinicians. Scale-up and sustainability of CETA in resource restricted environments requires empirical evidence that CETA is effective when administered by providers working in the local health system without ongoing case supervision by international partners. Specific Aim 3 will address this critical issue by comparing CETA modified for independent implementation (mCETA) to standard CETA (sCETA) and waitlist controls. Professional gains obtained from the structured training opportunities will be engaged to complete the clinical trial. Collectively, the structured implementation of this Phase II application will establish a formidable culture of research innovation to address current and future mental health needs of the Cambodian population. Outcomes will inform treatment strategies in other trauma-intense, resource restricted regions of the world."

"9375900","Axon terminals and muscle fibers secrete filamentous proteins into the synaptic cleft at neuromuscular junctions in skeletal muscles. There, the secreted proteins interact with each other and with non-secreted fila- mentous proteins that extend from the plasma membranes of the axon terminal and muscle fiber, altogether forming a stable, tightly adherent network of macromolecules called the synaptic basal lamina. The basal lami- na macromolecules not only serve to hold the membranes of the axon terminal and muscle fiber in close prox- imity for reliable acetylcholine-mediated synaptic impulse transmission, but they also include proteins active in regulating processes involved in synaptic transmission. Agrin secreted by the axon terminal is one such pro- tein. Its C-terminus interacts with the co-receptor proteins Lrp4 (low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4) and MuSK (muscle specific kinase), which extend from the muscle fiber?s postsynaptic membrane. This in- teraction directs the formation and maintenance of the postsynaptic apparatus of muscle fibers, which includes aggregates of the acetylcholine receptors in the muscle fibers? plasma membrane. Genetic defects in or auto- immune action against agrin, Lrp4 or MuSK correlate with myasthenias in some humans having the disease. There is evidence that the macromolecular architecture of synaptic basal lamina across vertebrates is highly ordered. However, the architecture has not been characterized by microscopic analysis for the neuromuscular junctions of any species, and, thus, the layout of the basal lamina proteins and their sites of interaction with other proteins within the architecture has not been determined. Much has been learned about synaptic basal lamina proteins, in general, and agrin?s mechanism of action, in particular, from studies on neuromuscular junc- tions of mice. Here, we propose to begin generating a quantitatively accurate 3-D map of the macromolecular architecture of the synaptic basal lamina at neuromuscular junctions of mature mice and to identify those mac- romolecules that contain the C-terminus of neural agrin. For these studies, we will use electron tomography on individual tissue sections from fixed, stained and plastic embedded muscles of normal mice and of mice in which we will genetically engineer the C-terminus of neural agrin to include miniSOG (mini singlet oxygen gen- erator) for histochemical localization. Electron tomography on tissue sections provides the best spatial resolu- tion currently obtainable for in situ 3-D structural analysis. The insertion of miniSOG into filamentous proteins by genetic engineering offers the most reliable method for histochemically localizing specific sites along them. It is expected that this study will provide the basis for us, and others, to map the architecture of the entire syn- aptic basal lamina and establish the complete layout and sites of interaction of neural agrin, Lrp4/MuSK and the other filamentous proteins that constitute the synaptic basal lamina. Such knowledge is essential for a comprehensive understanding of how the neuromuscular junction forms and functions and how its function is affected by disease."
"9314045","PROJECT SUMMARY Candidate and career goals: My overall career goal is to become an independent physician-scientist conducting interdisciplinary, patient-centered clinical research to improve sexual function in aging women. This K23 Career Development Award will provide me with the additional experience and skills to reach this goal. I have a long-standing passion for women's health and interdisciplinary investigation, and additional training in behavioral clinical trials, the psychological and physiologic aspects of female sexual function, and advanced research methods in geriatric women's health will ensure my successful transition to independence. Training will include didactic coursework, national workshops, society meetings, one-on-one mentored tutorials, and participation in seminars. My interdisciplinary mentoring team includes Dr. Thurston (primary mentor, women's health and aging), Dr. Resnick (geriatric women's health, behavioral trials), Dr. Borrero (qualitative research, career mentorship), and Dr. Brotto (mindfulness, sexual function). In addition, I will be supported by the University of Pittsburgh, a major academic medical center with a long history of high quality research. Currently ranked 5th in the nation in NIH funding, the University comprises a wealth of research and training resources to enable me to meet my goals. Research plan: Almost half of U.S. women experience sexual problems, which have significant negative impacts on physical and mental health. Low sexual desire is the most common sexual problem, particularly among women 50 and older, but there are few treatment options available. Treatments that can address both physical and psychological aspects of sexual dysfunction may be more effective than medications. Mindfulness is a practice that emphasizes in-the-moment focus and non-judgmental bodily awareness. A group-based behavioral intervention rooted in mindfulness has shown early promise in small trials, but only among younger women. The overall objective of this study is to adapt and pilot test a mindfulness intervention in women 50 and older with low sexual desire. In phase one, data from qualitative research among older women will be used by the primary investigator and a stakeholder advisory to adapt an existing mindfulness intervention. In phase 2, fifty women will be randomized to the adapted intervention or an educational control group on general health and aging. Feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, as well as changes sexual desire, function, and satisfaction, will be assessed. Findings from this study will be used to design a larger efficacy trial to test the adapted intervention. The proposed award is consistent with the mission of the NIA to support research using ?integrative approaches to the study of social, psychological, and physiological influences on health and well- being over the life course.? Developing effective treatments for women's sexual problems will not only improve women's sex lives. It will address a significant public health need by allowing adults to maintain high quality of life and essential social relationships with aging."
"9347715","PUBLIC ABSTRACT This project, in response to announcement HLS16-06, describes a development program for CARSKNKDC (CAR), a synthetic cyclic peptide that selectively targets diseased pulmonary vascular endothelium and enhances the therapeutic effect of vasodilator therapies, for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension (PH). PH is a disorder of elevated pulmonary vascular resistance characterized by progressive thickening and obliteration of resistance-determining vessels of the pulmonary circulation. Despite current therapies, survival following the diagnosis of PH remains slightly better than 50% at 5 years, with mortality a result of disease progression and right heart failure. Vasodilator therapies acting upon endothelin, prostacyclin, and nitric oxide pathways modestly improve functional status, but are limited by systemic side effects, toxicity, and tachyphylaxis. No current therapy selectively targets the diseased pulmonary circulation. CAR, whose peptide sequence has high sequence homology to protein heparin- binding domains, was identified by a phage screen for its enhanced binding to the vasculature of soft tissue wounds. We have demonstrated that CAR accumulates in the endothelium and adventitia of pulmonary vessels in animals with PH, but not systemic vessels, and not the pulmonary vessels of normal animals. When given with systemic vasodilator therapies, CAR potentiates selective vasodilatation of the pulmonary vascular bed without increasing systemic vasodilation. CAR peptide appears to enhance the delivery of drugs to diseased vessels by a co-administration effect without requiring conjugation to drugs. By virtue of its selective homing for damaged endothelium, we propose that chronic administration CAR will synergize with prostacyclin and PDE5 inhibitor therapies, with greater impact on pulmonary vascular remodeling. We have devised a strategy that will optimize the dosing, formulation and delivery, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this agent as an adjuvant therapy in combination with FDA-approved vasodilator therapies for PH. This potentially groundbreaking approach would constitute the first example of a targeted therapy specifically designed to address pulmonary vascular disease, and could address limitations of current PH therapy."

Analysis incorporates optimized  hybridization or primer driven assays for genomic capture and interrogation utilizing state of the art PCR,  microarray (bead, plate, cartridge) and, since 2012, sequencing (whole genome, exome, custom targeted)  technologies. The Specific Aims of the CGF are to 1) provide ?state of the art? genomic and transcriptomic  services, 2) assist with study design and provide consultation services, 3) provide integrated bioinformatics  and statistical analysis support, 4) strategically develop and implement advanced technologies, and 5) provide  genomics leadership, administrative, and operational excellence. The facility is located adjacent to the UPCI  Tissue and Research Pathology Services shared resource to expedite processing of specimens from diverse  preparations ranging from whole mounted tissues (fresh, flash frozen, formalin fixed) to individual tumor stem  cells. Protocols routinely incorporate manual and laser capture microdissection to mitigate effects of tumor  heterogeneity. Novel methods have been developed to capture and amplify limiting amounts of DNA and  RNA (<1ng) from archival (>10 years old) formalin fixed, paraffin embedded specimens. The CGF has  generated an extensive reference database of single nucleotide polymorphisms and genomic sequence (70  samples) from ?normal? tissues for patient samples lacking matched germline specimens e.g. to serve as a  gene copy number control. CGF collaborates closely with TARPS and CBS to ensure that UPCI investigators  have benefit from optimized workflows. The facility routinely provides services to researchers from UPCI  Programs, spanning basic, population science, and translational drug discovery and disease-site programs as  well as each of the 3.5 SPOREs housed at UPCI. The CGF is also an integral component of the UPCI high-  risk, high-reward initiative supporting development of early stage investigators and promoting new research  pathways for established investigators. During the current project period investigators in nine UPCI Research  Programs used the CGF."

However, if warranted, we are prepared to  consider P&F grant applications from our collaborators at Duke Medical School, NC State and other TCORS  Centers that fit in with our theme of Impaired Innate Defense with Tobacco Exposure. We would note that we  have had extensive experience with this type of program in the context of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Pilot  & Feasibility Program which we have run over the past fifteen years. We developed an algorithm that we  believe was successful in that endeavor which we would use for the TCORS P&F program. This will include  the following: 1) An eariy (six months prior to submission date) and widely disseminated announcement (on  the UNC Pulmonary Division, Cystic Fibrosis/Pulmonary Research and Treatment Center, COPD Center and  Center for Environmental Medicine and Curriculum in Toxicology websites, e-mail networi<, and through oral  disclosures at weekly meetings) of the availability of Pilot & Feasibility projects; 2) a pre-review of one to two  page outlines of Pilot & Feasibility Projects with the Director and Co-Director ofthe TCORS P&F Program; 3) a  review (including an NIH-type priority score) of the Pilot & Feasibility Programs by the Program Director, Co-  Director, other Co-investigators and at least two members of the Advisory Committee who are experts in the  area pertinent to the P&F and 4) the development of a database/tracking mechanism to follow in the outlying  years the success of the P&F grant program in generating extramural funding. In the past, we have been  particularty successful in the P&F Program in developing the science required for successful multi-investigator  grant applications, including Program Projects. Further, this mechanism has been highly successful in  generating successful KOS, K21, and ROI applications for junior faculty. Thus, we would plan to model the  TCORS P&F Program award mechanism along similar lines."
"9301411","7. Project Summary- Resource Core 3 The central hypothesis of the Neuromotor Mechanisms and Rehabilitation (NMR) Core (Resource Core-3) is that appropriately-selected activity and exercise-based rehabilitation interventions can promote beneficial changes in brain ((central nervous system (CNS) structure, connectivity, and physiology)) and neuromotor mechanisms to improve motor performance and function and minimize disability in chronic medical conditions affecting older people. Resource Core-3 (RC-3) provides support, guidance, and mentoring to UM-OAIC investigators using a multi-system approach focused on whole-body balance, mobility, and upper limb activities to address the mechanistic bases upon which to build novel rehabilitation strategies to improve motor function and independence and promote recovery in older people with chronic disease-associated disabilities. Through this framework, functional activity and exercise-mediated brain and neuromotor plasticity can be identified to guide condition-specific and individual-specific rehabilitation approaches for minimizing disability. The complementary and collaborative relationship between RC-3 and RC-2 focusing on muscle, metabolic, and cardiovascular mechanisms of aging with disability, forges a strong and comprehensive inter-core synergy for understanding the multi-system bases for designing and testing effective new rehabilitation programs. RC-3 collaborates across UM-OAIC cores in research working groups to train and develop the next generation of investigators and rehabilitation interventions that will enhance motor function in older adults with chronic disability. Using a toolbox of methodologies, it performs quantitative tests of whole-body posture and balance, mobility, upper limb activities, and functional tasks that characterize the processes of brain and neuromotor control and plasticity underlying functional activity and exercise derived gains in motor performance and function across UM-OAIC interventions. RC-3 will continue to support, augment, and develop ongoing and new projects that will define the changes in both the CNS and the periphery with chronic disabling conditions of aging, and devise effective rehabilitation programs to enhance motor function and prevent chronic disability."
"9279622","Project Summary Abstract: Our capability to apply high-throughput molecular profiling technologies to increasingly large cohorts and sample sets is significantly expanding our understanding of human biology and complex disease. The Genotype Tissue-Expression (GTEx) project is creating a unique resource of genetic variation and gene expression across a wide range of human tissues. Upon completion this will include RNA sequence data from over 25,000 samples spanning 53 human tissues/organs and whole genome and exome sequence data from 960 donors. Additional data types not yet generated will include miRNA-seq, protein levels, DNA methylation, ChIP-seq, and DNase I hypersensitive site data among others. The ability to easily access, interpret and integrate these large data sets by a wide range of users with varying needs and skills is becoming of critical importance to leverage the full utility of the data. The GTEx Portal (http://gtexportal.org/) is the most widely accessed resource for the GTEx project, hosting all unprotected data, analysis results and numerous visual exploration tools, and has been enthusiastically received by the scientific community. To maximize the impact of this resource, we plan to expand the portal to: host data currently in production and new data types still to be generated; present novel and integrative analyses of existing data, and data from external sources; and to develop and share flexible tools for data analysis, visualization and access. Aim 1. We will host and support all open-access GTEx data and analysis results, performing systematic re-analyses of the data with new methods to reflect the state-of-the-art in RNA-seq analysis. We will add all new data sets to the portal to include novel assays (e.g. mi-RNA-seq, protein, methylation assays, etc/), derived analysis results (e.g. trans-eQTLs, splice- QTLs, GWAS enrichment analyses, protein-QTLs, etc.), and RNA-seq data sets from external investigators. Aim 2. We will work closely with both small focus groups of tool developers and engage our large user-base to identify and prioritize new features for development to display and integrate between multiple data types, and collaborate with other large genomic resources (e.g. ENCODE, UCSC and ENSEMBL browsers) to enable better integration of data sources and to enhance the utility and accessibility of the GTEx resource. Aim 3. We will automate and share all analysis pipeline tools with the scientific community. To support a wide range of user access needs, we will develop an open-source API to provide comprehensive data access, and also improve visualization tools and user-driven data analyses on the portal. To maximize use of the resource, we will design and offer training videos and outreach workshops.  "
"9364527","PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal examines the mechanisms by which G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) signal pain. Chronic pain is a hallmark of disease, a side effect of therapy, and a major cause of suffering. Although GPCRs mediate all aspects of nociception and are major therapeutic targets, the mechanisms by which GPCRs signal sustained pain are poorly understood, and clinical trials of GPCR antagonists in chronic pain often fail for unexplained reasons. The proposal challenges three dogmas that contribute to this lack of understanding: 1. GPCRs signal only from the cell-surface. 2. Endosomes are merely a conduit for GPCR recycling or degradation. 3. Cell-surface GPCRs are the optimal therapeutic target. The proposal hypothesizes that: 1. Endosomal GPCRs generate sustained signals that mediate persistent excitation of spinal neurons and nociception. 2. Targeting endosomal rather than cell-surface GPCRs is the ideal therapeutic strategy, and the clinical failure of conventional antagonists relates to their inability to inhibit endosomal receptors. Experiments will focus on substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide receptors, which mediate central pain transmission and are internalized after painful stimuli. The contribution of receptor endocytosis to nociception will be evaluated using pharmacological and genetic approaches to disrupt clathrin, dynamin and ?-arrestin, and by studying transgenic mice expressing non-internalizing receptors. Lipid-conjugation and nanoparticle- encapsulation will be used to deliver antagonists to endosomal GPCRs. Aim 1 will determine the contribution of endocytosis to somatic and colonic nociception in conscious mice. Aim 2 will define the importance of endocytosis for excitation of spinal neurons, which will be analyzed in intact tissues using electrophysiology. Aim 3 will determine the requirement of endocytosis for the generation of signals in subcellular compartments that underlie neuronal excitation and nociception, which will be studied in isolated neurons using biophysical, imaging and proteomic approaches. The results will provide fundamental information about pain signaling and therapy. Since GPCRs are the largest class of signaling proteins and the target of one half of therapeutic drugs, the outcomes will be broadly significant."
"9219976","Project Summary Integrated Genome Browser (IGB) is a popular desktop genome browser used by thousands of scientists worldwide to visualize, explore, and analyze large-scale data sets from genomics. Implemented in Java, IGB can run on any computer platform and provides state-of-the-art, fast zooming and visual analytics functions. Since its inception, IGB has supported a data sharing and publication system called IGB Quickload, in which users deploy metadata and data files on Web sites and then share their data by publicizing the Quickload URL. However, many users lack access to hosting services or lack technical knowledge required to set and configure a Web site. To solve this problem and give users access to advanced computational power, we propose to integrate IGB and Quickload with CyVerse, a National Science Foundation-funded cyberinfrastructure project formerly called iPlant that launched in 2008. CyVerse contains a suite of user- friendly, Web-based data analysis and data storage tools accessible via a computational interface called the Agave API Web services. We will use the Agave Web services to connect IGB with CyVerse, enabling users to share data and collaborate using CyVerse infrastructure. We propose to perform this CyVerse-to-IGB integration in four phases, with each phase building on the next. First, we will add the ability for IGB users to log into their CyVerse accounts, browse data sets within IGB, and load data directly as new IGB tracks. In Phase 2, we will use the Agave metadata API to link data curation with visualization, thus facilitating data sharing, collaborating, and publication. In Phase 3, we will create tools for users to share and publicize their results with the larger scientific community, re-using metadata they created while viewing and interacting with their data. In Phase 4, we will empower users to perform more sophisticated visual analytics functions than are currently possible within IGB (or any desktop browser) by harnessing CyVerse computational resources. This will pave the way for our team and others to develop all-new visualizations that leverage advanced computing resources available from CyVerse. More generally, this project will build new understanding of how rich client, desktop applications like IGB can interact with and leverage cloud-based resources to benefit users and advance science."
"9302829","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Discovering the genetic basis of human heart disease presents a remarkable opportunity to predict and prevent disease. By identifying at-risk individuals prior to clinical diagnosis and fostering development of novel therapies to delay or prevent clinical expression, genetic discoveries can transform medicine.  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) provides a paradigm for fulfilling this opportunity. HCM is the most common monogenic cardiovascular disorder and is caused by dominant mutations in sarcomere genes.  Clinical characteristics include left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), myocardial fibrosis, diastolic dysfunction, and an increased risk for arrhythmias, sudden death and heart failure. Unexplained LVH, the defining clinical feature of HCM, is a relatively late manifestation of disease and typically emerges around the time of puberty. In contrast, gene-based diagnosis identifies not only individuals who carry pathogenic mutations (G+) and have overt disease (LVH+), but also at-risk G+ individuals who have not yet developed a clinical diagnosis of HCM (LVH-). Our investigations of G+/LVH- preclinical HCM subjects have identified novel early phenotypes in this important subset, thus providing insight into the initial consequences of sarcomere mutations and disease pathogenesis. Impaired LV relaxation and increased myocardial collagen synthesis both precede the onset of LVH.  Furthermore, preclinical mutation carriers are a unique at-risk population to target therapies to prevent disease progression. Promising work in animal models has shown that early pharmacologic therapy can counteract the effect of pathogenic sarcomere mutation and diminish the emergence of HCM. Molecular network analysis in mouse models of HCM identified a central role for transforming growth factor-beta (TGFß) activation in myocardial fibrogenesis. Administration of neutralizing antibody or angiotensin II receptor blockade to inhibit TGF-ß activation in prehypertrophic HCM mice was associated with less development of hypertrophy and fibrosis compared with placebo. Collectively these data suggest considerable benefit from defining genetic susceptibility and intervening early in HCM. Through our 2-stage CTRIP studies, we will foster clinical translation of these key scientific discoveries, culminating in a Phase II multicenter, doubleblind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of the potent ARB, candesartan, in attenuating disease progression, using early phenotypes as surrogate endpoints to monitor treatment response. With these efforts, we will begin to reshape the clinical paradigm for treating adult-onset genetic disorders, based on early diagnosis, mechanistic insight, and disease modification."
"9329522","Our long-range objective is to develop a CNI-free therapeutic approach to safely promote organ transplant tolerance. Two promising complementary but interactive approaches to regulatory immune cell therapy for transplant tolerance,- DCreg and Treg, comprise this U19 application. They will share a novel IS drug regimen, rationally-designed to enhance the regulatory function of these cells in graft recipients. In Project 1, our preliminary data show that donor-derived DCreg infusion before transplantation promotes renal allograft survival in rhesus macaques receiving a short-term, minimal IS regimen of costimulation blockade (CoSB) and tapered rapamycin. This effect is associated with selective attenuation of donor-reactive memory T cell (Tmem) responses. Recent clinical data show that lymphodepletion followed by CoSB and rapamycin maintenance prevents CoSB-resistant acute rejection and selectively inhibits recovery of donor-reactive Tmem, although operational tolerance was not achieved. We therefore hypothesize that a regimen comprising ATG, CoSB and rapamycin that (i) is more permissive to extended graft survival and that (ii) incorporates the immunomodulatory function of adoptively-transferred DCreg, will promote IS-drug free, donor-specific tolerance. In Project 2, we will address shortcomings of Treg therapy (Treg timing, specificity, instability or conversion to Teff) recently underscored in a recent NHP study by our group. We will do so by building on our success in expanding highly-suppressive, donor-alloreactive rhesus Treg (arTreg) ex vivo, and on the basis of our recent finding that IL-2 + TGF?1/Fc can selectively promote rhesus Treg, while inhibiting Th17 responses. We hypothesize that delayed arTreg administration to ATG, CoSB and rapamycin-treated transplant recipients, together with low-dose IL-2 and TGF?1/Fc, will enhance their stability/persistence, promote their suppressive function, overcome Tmem activity and promote transplant tolerance. Our Overall Aims are: Project 1: To determine the capacity of DCreg infusion to promote operational renal transplant tolerance in NHP given combined ATG (lymphodepletion) and CoSB (belatacept or ?CD40 mAb) plus rapamycin maintenance. Project 2: To determine the capacity of alloreactive Treg to promote operational renal transplant tolerance in NHP given combined ATG, CoSB (belatacept) plus rapamycin maintenance, together with low-dose IL-2 ± huTGF?1Fc. Both projects will be accompanied by highly-interactive, mechanistic studies and assess novel biomarker (eomesodermin) expression by alloreactive Tmem as a potential predictor of transplant outcome/tolerance.

Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center (Lurie Cancer Center) has developed a robust system for data and safety monitoring, accomplished through the collaborative efforts of the three committees of the Clinical Protocol Scientific Review and Monitoring System (CPSRMS). These committees are: the Scientific Review Committee (SRC), the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), and the Clinical Trial Audit Committee (CTAC). These committees are responsible for administering the Lurie Cancer Center's Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP), which was originally approved by the NCI in August of 2001, and has since undergone 10 revisions. The most recent revision to the plan was submitted to the NCI in May of 2012 and was accepted without comment at that time. In the previous competing CCSG application the assessment of Data and Safety Monitoring resulted in an Acceptable [Approved] status with no deficiencies noted. However, in section 9.2 PRMS, the previous CCSG competing submission included comments in the critique that relate directly to data and safety monitoring. First, it was suggested that the CTAC expand the auditing program to be more comprehensive. This has been done, and the audit strategy is described below. The second comment relates to DMC review for phase I studies and offered that a medical monitor may provide greater oversight for these trials if our phase I studies increase in number. A significant increase has not been seen, so this change has not been made, however both the SRC and DMC are mindful of and appreciate this recommendation. If our phase I program increases substantially, this change will be considered."
"9260378","Project 4 - Biomedical Project 2 ? BP2 - Project Summary Native American communities in the Southwestern United States have concerns that uranium (U) and arsenic (As) exposures arising from abandoned U mine sites have increased the prevalence of metal-associated diseases including immune dysfunction. These concerns are based on environmental exposures linked to the >1100 abandoned Cold War U waste sites and documented U and As well water contamination. Immature pre- T (thymus) and pre-B (bone marrow) have been found to be extremely sensitive to As(III) and perhaps U[VI] in the form of uranyl acetate (UA) exposures. The immunotoxicity of UA has not been previously characterized. We provide preliminary data that UA interacts with As(III) to produce immunotoxicity via both genotoxic (DNA damage through PARP inhibition), and non-genotoxic (IL-7 signaling in pre-T and pre-B cells) in the mouse. We also hypothesize that immature lymphoid cells lack the ability to export metals, leading to increased exposures. In the present studies we will test this hypothesis by direct measurement of lymphoid organ concentrations following UA and As(III) exposures, alone and in combination, following drinking water exposures. It is important to understand the mechanisms of pre-T and pre-B sensitivity to UA and AsIII exposures because these pathways could explain alterations in T and B cell selection that are responsible for human immune dysregulation (such as autoimmunity), These studies provide a strong framework for interaction with BP-1 and EP-1. At the molecular level, UA and As(III) have been found to displace Zn, and inhibit PARP-1 function leading to DNA damage. Although the UA may not have strong immunotoxicity on its own, there appears to be important synergy with UA and As(III). The bases for these interactions are not well understood. The proposed studies will evaluate several potential mechanism for UA and As(III) interactions. We also propose to investigate other environmentally relevant metal mixtures. These studies also provide a framework for understanding how interventions, such as Zn supplementation, can be used to prevent arsenic/uranium toxicity (BP-1) and perhaps other environmentally relevant metal mixtures (EP-1). The proposed studies will provide critical mechanistic insights into the potential immunotoxicity of UA, its interactions with As(III) as well as other metals and, importantly, the potential for use of zinc therapy to modify immune diseases in sensitive populations who are environmentally exposed to these metals."
"9366904","PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this project is to provide evidence of the value of measuring social determinants of health (SDH) in the Medicaid population. This project will demonstrate that risk stratification using traditional risk adjustment models (RAMs) can be improved significantly with the inclusion of SDH information in addition to the information these models typically rely on: age, gender, and medical diagnoses. In addition, this project will quantify incident and cumulative risk of various SDH factors on the onset of incident disease within a one year period, highlighting the need to address social and environmental disadvantages that drive health inequities so that Medicaid can achieve the triple aim: improved care and population health at lower cost. To accomplish our objectives, we will conduct a prospective cohort study that will enroll 9,600 adult Medicaid beneficiaries treated at two medical facilities located in Washington, DC. The study sample will be predominately black (i.e. 90%) with a slightly higher percentage of females (60%). Medicaid beneficiaries who participate will complete a comprehensive SDH assessment during their initial medical encounter that will include validated SDH questions that measure housing stability, food availability, financial strain, health behaviors, social support, etc. Six and 12 months after enrollment, we will conduct a telephone follow-up interview with subjects to determine if there have been any major changes to their social and environmental circumstances. We will merge the interview data with DC Medicaid claims data (two years pre and one year post enrollment date). We will use the prior claims data to characterize health care utilization and expenditures by: (1) different types of service (i.e., inpatient care, outpatient care, prescription drugs, etc); (2) acute versus chronic treatments; and (3) preventable versus non preventable. We will risk stratify the study sample using three RAMs (i.e., Chronic Disability and Payment System, The Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups (ACG) System, and 3M Clinical Risk Groups (CRGs). We will compare predictions of next year's health care utilization and expenditures for each RAM using generalized linear models that include or exclude SDH variables. We will also quantify the incident and cumulative risk associated with different SDH factors on disease onset during a one year follow-up period using generalized estimating equation models. To reduce the large health inequities that exist in the Medicaid population, this project aims to demonstrate the critical need to measure and address SDH in our care delivery strategies."
"9365783","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The relationship between sleep and general anesthesia is of great clinical relevance given the high prevalence of patients with sleep disorders or insufficient sleep undergoing major surgery. To date, there is an incomplete understanding of how mechanisms that regulate anesthetic state transitions and sleep homeostasis interact. The preoptic region is a critical node for sleep regulation. The median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) regulates both state transitions and sleep homeostasis, making it a key, yet virtually unexplored, substrate for sleep- anesthesia interactions. Preliminary data obtained for this application suggest that distinct neuronal subpopulations within MnPO control the transition to and from general anesthesia as well as sleep-wake oscillations. Our long-term goal is to understand the neurobiological and clinical relationship between sleep and general anesthesia. The goal of the proposed studies is to examine the role of GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons in the MnPO and ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) in sleep homeostasis and general anesthesia. The proposed studies will use Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) to test the hypothesis that the MnPO is a primary site for arousal state control, and that GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons in the MnPO regulate different aspects of sleep-wake states and general anesthesia. Aim 1 will use DREADDs for selective activation of GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons in the MnPO and VLPO to probe a causal relationship in controlling anesthetic induction, emergence, and post- anesthesia sleep-wake behaviors. In a second set of experiments we will test whether DREADD manipulations of MnPO and VLPO differentially alter corticocortical functional connectivity during wakefulness and general anesthesia. Aim 2 will assess the role of GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons in the MnPO and VLPO in sleep-wake regulation. Analysis of c-Fos immunoreactivity will reveal putative downstream targets of MnPO and VLPO neurons in sleep/wake-related areas. Additional experiments will determine whether activation of GABAergic neurons in the MnPO during general anesthesia can accelerate the anesthetic- induced recovery of sleep debt accrued during previous sleep deprivation. The proposed experiments will significantly advance our understanding of the mechanisms that regulate sleep-anesthesia interactions. These data will also provide a novel paradigm of how a single brain region (in this case, the MnPO) can control anesthetic induction and emergence through GABAergic and glutamatergic mechanisms, respectively."
"9383602","PROJECT SUMMARY Childhood obesity poses a critical public health concern, with obese children vulnerable to the development of potentially fatal chronic diseases. Scientific evidence has demonstrated that daily physical activity (PA) is imperative in preventing the onset of obesity. In an effort to develop engaging health interventions to promote PA among children, researchers are incorporating digital technology as a platform for health promotion. These interventions often focus on extrinsic rewards as the primary source of motivation, incentivizing children with points for being active. Emerging evidence indicates that technology-mediated health interventions that encourage children to focus solely on winning extrinsic rewards and isolate young people from social supports for PA have limited effects that may disappear altogether when the extrinsic rewards stop. We propose to evaluate a novel technology-mediated health intervention: the Virtual Fitness Buddy (VFB) Ecosystem was designed to encourage children to embrace PA as a lifestyle change rather than a means to gain points. The Ecosystem leverages existing social relationships in children?s lives, primarily the parent-child relationship, capitalizing on the power of social support that parents provide to children. Using consumer-grade technology devices, such as mobile phones, parents can stay involved in the intervention and support their children even when they cannot be with their children. In addition, a virtual pet, designed to mimic human-pet relationships in the physical world, will guide children to set and meet PA goals and offer tailored support. Using technology to amplify the power of existing social relationships, children will learn to embrace PA as a lifestyle change while supported by their parents and the virtual pet within the Ecosystem. In collaboration with YMCA, 720 children and 720 parents in 24 afterschool programs will randomly be assigned to treatment and control groups in a cluster-randomized controlled trial. Afterschool programs in the treatment group will offer the VFB Ecosystem intervention for a 3-month period; programs in the control group will receive standard of care without the Ecosystem. All children will complete baseline assessments, 3-month posttest, 6-month follow up, and a 12-month follow up of PA outcomes. Parents and youth will also provide self-report data on their perceived relationship quality, motivation, and PA self-efficacy. We aim to test the hypotheses that 1) youth assigned to the VFB Ecosystem will evince higher levels of moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA than those in the control group, and 2) test the parent and youth mechanisms of change, including parent-child interaction, children?s perceived level of social support, and parental involvement in children?s PA. The VFB Ecosystem represents a new generation of technology-mediated health interventions for children, which integrates technology into existing social systems, to promote sustainable lifestyle changes. Because the Ecosystem is a cost- and labor-effective solution that integrates consumer-grade technology with low barriers for continued use, it has the potential for rapid diffusion and widespread public health impact."
"9347306","7. Project Summary/Abstract A current unmet clinical need is a commercial vaccine to protect at risk populations (the very young and the elderly) against Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) ? a respiratory pathogen that annually in the US causes 172,000 hospitalizations and 1.5 million outpatient visits in children < 5 years old and >14,000 deaths in those over 65. The burden of this pathogen is even more pronounced in the developing world. In this Direct to Phase II project, we will further commercialize candidate live- attenuated RSV vaccine strain we have developed using our vaccine design platform, SAVE (Synthetic Attenuated Virus Engineering) (Coleman, et al. 2008 Science). SAVE is unlike any vaccine platform previously investigated ? it does not use blind serial passaging, an attenuated carrier backbone virus, or virus-like particles. SAVE utilizes genome de-optimization, and synonymous re- coding of viral ORFs to yield live-attenuated vaccine strains and has shown proof-of-concept in seven unique viruses. These designer vaccine strains are 100% antigenically identical to the wild type and present all antigens of the target virus. Our SAVE-designed RSV vaccine strains were developed in collaboration with pre-eminent RSV scientist Dr. Peter Collins of NIH-NIAID. We now have lead candidate, RSV-MinA, that is highly attenuated and shown to induce immunity in non-human primates, efficacy in Cotton Rats, and the recently demonstrated ability to neutralize human clinical RSV isolates of A and B subtypes. Furthermore, we have demonstrated genetic and phenotypic stability of MinA after serial passage. Based on our early success in primates, in August 2016 Codagenix was granted a second no fee NIAID-DMID service contract (#:VM16RDB640; PO: Kim) in support of this project to execute Process Development to develop a cGMP compliant manufacturing process for our lead RSV vaccine candidate MinA in preparation of cGMP manufacturing of clinical lots. Vaccine commercialization is a costly and multi-faceted development process that requires adherence to regulatory guidelines set by the FDA. Therefore, in this project we seek funds to support the other areas of pre-clinical development of these SAVE-designed RSV vaccine strains. These experiments include continued assaying for genetic/phenotypic stability, cGMP Master Cell Bank construction and characterization, cGMP clinical vaccine lot manufacturing, and GLP toxicology. At the end of this project, we will have produced a SAVE-RSV vaccine candidate ready for a Phase I clinical trial. The overall goal of the proposed work is to further commercialize a live-attenuated RSV vaccine that will be administered intranasally. In the initial phases of this effort (pilot data akin to a Phase I SBIR grant), Codagenix (in collaboration with Dr. Peter Collins at NIH) developed and characterized three promising RSV vaccine candidates. Efficacy, safety, and demonstration of the induction of a cross- reactive immune response has now narrowed this field of candidates to a single candidate (RSV- MinA) ready for cGMP manufacturing. We seek funds to support all other aspect of pre-clinical development to prepare this RSV vaccine for a Phase I trial."

"9217866","PROJECT SUMMARY Formation of the pharyngeal arch arteries (PAAs) is defective in patients with DiGeorge syndrome, the most common chromosomal abnormality in humans. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating PAA formation are not well understood. For many years, it was believed that PAAs developed by the process of angiogenesis, whereby PAAs were thought to form as branches stemming from the dorsal aorta that invade the avascular pharyngeal arches. However, recent studies in mutant mice with defective PAA formation suggested that the mutant phenotypes and the presence of a primitive vascular plexus within the pharyngeal arches were incompatible with the idea that PAAs formed via angiogenesis. Instead, these studies suggested that PAAs develop by the process of vasculogenesis, whereby PAAs arise de-novo from pharyngeal vascular endothelial progenitors. We employed transient labeling and cell lineage tracking to resolve this issue and demonstrated that endothelial cells of PAAs arise from the second heart field. Furthermore, our time-resolved, 3D confocal imaging showed that PAAs form by reorganization of the primitive vascular plexus into the PAA. In the course of our studies, we discovered that the extracellular matrix glycoprotein fibronectin (Fn1) is required for the formation of the 4th pair of PAAs, and that conditional deletion of Fn1 in the Isl1 lineage caused severe congenital aortic arch defects, similar to those observed in DiGeorge syndrome. We found that the number and density of endothelial cells in Fn1flox/-;Isl1Cre animals is much lower than in controls, and hypothesize that Fn1 mediates PAA formation by regulating the differentiation of SHF-derived endothelial progenitors into endothelial cells or by regulating the migration of endothelial progenitors from the SHF into the pharyngeal arches. In this grant application, we propose to test these hypotheses and to refine the spatio-temporal mechanisms regulating the development of PAA progenitors. We then propose to apply our methodology to systematically elucidate the basis for the PAA formation defects in Tbx1+/- mutants that model the DiGeorge syndrome. We plan to achieve these goals by addressing the following specific aims: 1) To determine the mechanisms, by which Fn1 regulates PAA morphogenesis; 2) To determine the role of VEGFR2positive cells within the SHF in PAA development; and 3) To determine the stage(s) of PAA formation regulated by Tbx1. We will use conditional mutagenesis, time-resolved confocal imaging and 3D reconstruction to test our hypotheses, and investigate the role of Fn1 in growth factor signaling during PAA formation. Furthermore, we will employ an innovative live multi-photon microscopy to investigate the dynamics of endothelial cells during PAA formation in living embryos, and the roles of Fn1 and Tbx1 in this process. Completion of these studies will provide important insights into the mechanisms of normal PAA formation and into alterations that cause defective PAA development in patients with congenital heart disease."

"9361260","PROJECT SUMMARY Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the world?s deadliest disease, affects an estimated one-third of the world?s population. There is an urgent need to deepen our understanding of Mtb physiology so that new drug targets can be identified and exploited, thereby resulting in improved human health. Mtb has evolved to utilize the host?s cholesterol as a main carbon source when enveloped by the macrophage, increasing its persistence and pathogenicity. The genes mftC, mftD, and mftE were shown to be critical for Mtb growth on cholesterol and belong to the mycofactocin biosynthetic pathway, which is encoded by the gene cluster mftABCDE. Mycofactocin has been proposed to be a novel, peptide-derived, redox cofactor, however the final structure and physiological role of the molecule has yet to be determined. It is known that the first step of mycofactocin biosynthesis begins with the MftC catalyzed decarboxylation of the conserved C-terminal tyrosine on MftA, assisted by protein interactions with the peptide chaperone MftB. Characterization of mycofactocin biosynthesis is a straightforward approach towards evaluating a potentially druggable pathway while advancing our understanding of a critical component in Mtb physiology and constitutes the long-term goal. The overall objective of this application is to apply biochemical and biophysical concepts and techniques to study mycofactocin biosynthesis by elucidating the chemical mechanism of MftC catalysis, resolving the sequences required for protein interactions within the pathway, and to elucidate the chemistry and the product of MftD catalysis. The central hypothesis is that mycofactocin is synthesized from extensive modification of the C-terminal tyrosine on MftA by MftC and MftD. These modifications require fine tuning of the electrochemical environments of the redox centers in MftC, a flavin dependent reaction catalyzed by MftD, and specific protein-protein and protein-peptide interactions. Considering that MftC, MftD, and MftE are required for Mtb, leaving the mycofactocin biosynthetic pathway uncharacterized prevents potentially exploiting them as therapeutic targets for Mtb. Guided by strong preliminary data, the hypothesis will be tested by the three specific aims: 1) Determine the mechanism of MftC catalyzed oxidative decarboxylation of MftA, 2) Resolve sequence motifs involved in interactions with the mycofactocin biosynthetic pathway peptide and peptide chaperone, and 3) Discover the function of MftD in mycofactocin biosynthesis. The research is innovative, because it departs from the status quo by elucidating the biosynthesis of a potentially new, peptide derived, redox cofactor and by providing sequence and spatial resolution of the little understood protein interactions that are required for mycofactocin biosynthesis. Advances made through the characterization of the mycofactocin biosynthetic pathway will provide valuable information about essential Mtb proteins and will increase our understanding of Mtb physiology. Such knowledge has the potential to be leveraged for therapeutic development for the treatment of world?s deadliest disease."
"9390564","ABSTRACT In pregnancy, endothelial vasodilation is enhanced to decrease blood pressure and increase uterine blood flow. Pregnancy-enhanced vasodilatory function is achieved through an increase in expression of angiotensin type 2 receptor (AT2R) in the endothelium of uterine and systemic vasculature. In preeclampsia, this adaptive endothelial response fails due to downregulation of AT2R expression and activity, with associated endothelial dysfunction, increased vascular resistance, and hypertension. Preeclampsia affects 5%?8% of all pregnancies, and treatment is limited to antihypertensives that relax vascular smooth muscle. There is no treatment to directly address endothelial failure. The cause of preeclampsia is not known, but the pregnancy-specific upregulation of AT2R in the vasculature may hold important keys to understanding the origins of the disease and the underlying causes of maternal organ function. The opportunity to study the effects of novel oral nonpeptide Compund21 is significant and valuable. Based on solid preliminary data, we propose that pregnancy selectively upregulates endothelial AT2R via differential binding of ligand-activated estrogen receptor (ie, ER? vs ER?) to a functional estrogen response element (ERE) in the AT2R promoter. Failure of vascular AT2R upregulation during pregnancy plays a role in endothelial cell dysfunction and vasoconstriction in preeclampsia and, consequently, activation of this system reverses preeclamptic vascular dysfunction. Aim 1 will first establish pregnancy-specific upregulation of AT2R in the endothelium and then define the mechanistic role of ER ? or ? in upregulation of AT2R by using ER-specific agonists, antagonists, and siRNA in rodent models. AT2R transcription mechanisms will determine differential binding of ligand- activated ER and transcription factors to putative ERE in AT2R promoter in primary human uterine artery endothelial cells, using ChiP and EMSA/ supershift assays, and then use reporter assays to determine their functionality. Aim 2 will move towards clinical translational relevance. We will determine if vascular AT2R is involved in preeclamptic endothelial dysfunction and if AT2R activation rescues vascular dysfunction. To test the AT2R-mediated mechanisms, EDHF, NO, and PGI2 pathways of vascular relaxation pathways will be determined. Also, the expression of eNOS and its activity state?signaling components of EDHF and PGI2 pathways as well as nitrate/ nitrite and PGI2 production and changes in membrane potential?will be measured. Aim 3 will verify the AT2R effects in vivo. We will use 2 models of gestational hypertension to test the effect of 2 selective AT2R agonists (CGP-42112 peptide and Compound 21) on the maternal, placental, and fetal abnormalities associated with preeclampsia. These studies will provide new information of how pregnancy increases endothelial AT2R and that failure of this process leads to preeclamptic endothelial dysfunction. The positive translational significance of these aims is that they evaluate the therapeutic utility of an endothelium- targeted therapy which is potentially safe in preeclampsia subjects."

"9374238","Project Summary/Abstract The progressive accumulation of ?-synuclein intracellular inclusions in the nervous system is a characteristic feature of dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease which are part of a spectrum of sporadic and hereditary neurodegenerative diseases termed ?-synucleinopathies. The definitive involvement of ?-synuclein in the etiology of these disorders was established by the findings that mutations in ?-synuclein can directly cause these neurodegenerative disorders. Many studies suggest that the progressive spread of ?-synuclein pathology in the peripheral nervous system and the brain through direct ?-synuclein interactions and transmission between cells may contribute to disease progression. However, some studies characterizing the properties of novel ?- synuclein mutants demonstrated divergent effects that are not consistent with this simple spreading mechanism. It is also important to emphasize that there is still ongoing debate as to the nature of the toxic ?-synuclein species. To provide new insights on these contentious and critical issues that will address the unique properties of disease-associated ?-synuclein mutants, we have formed a team of experienced investigators with diverse and unique expertise. In Aim 1, we will determine the inherent aggregation and neurotoxicity properties of these novel ?-synuclein mutants in vivo and compare these outcomes to the more extensively characterized ?-synuclein mutants. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that in vivo prion-like seeding can differentially impact the induction and propagation of ?-synuclein inclusion pathology of disease-causal ?-synuclein mutants with unique stain-like properties. These studies will provide pivotal information regarding the neurotoxicity of abnormal forms of ?- synuclein, their impact of the induction and spread of ?-synuclein pathology and the associations with neurodegeneration."
"9301545","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Increasing sophistication of brain recording technology has not been matched by a similarly sophisticated mathematical approach that permits modeling and prediction of the relation between behavior and the activity of populations of cells deep within the nervous system. This is particularly true for motor systems, where the primary goal is control of the dynamics of the environment. Our goal is to create multiscale models of motor components of the spinal cord that can link at least four scales: (1) individual neuron firing, (2) local neural population activity, (3) topographic maps of activity across the spinal cord, and (4) behavior. We propose to use the spinalized frog as our testbed, because the biomechanics are well understood, proprioceptive feedback is simplified, the cord can be studied in isolation from cortical control, and repeatable complex movements can be generated in the absence of cortical control. We will use and further develop a new mathematical framework based upon superposition of stochastic dynamic operators. It is appropriate to consider neural activity as causing a modification of the system dynamics, so that the resulting dynamics (including movement, compliance, and oscillatory behavior) achieve a desired result. The new framework allows us to model the response to dynamic environments, compliant control, reflex behavior, the effect of single spikes, and the combined effect of multiple neurons in a population. We can examine oscillatory activity (such as found in the central pattern generator (CPG) for locomotion) and the role of proprioceptive feedback. Because this theory operates at the level of single spikes and all neural representations are local and can use local learning rules, it provides a much closer link to the actual biological computations and could provide insight into the mechanisms used by the spinal cord to generate complex and varied movement. To test our understanding of the behavior of populations of neurons in the intermediate layers of spinal cord, we will (1) read out the dynamics of ongoing movement including perturbation responses and compliance, (2) modify the dynamics of ongoing movement, (3) create topographic maps showing the distribution of control functions across the cord. These experiments will allow us to understand control by neural populations of the dynamics of movement in a detailed way that links the neural scale to the population scale to the motor behavioral scale. The mathematical framework provides a new model for understanding the function of populations of neurons and predicting their effect on behavior. It also provides a quantitative model that allows the prediction of the effect of modification of firig or injury on behavior. Finally, it will provide the basis for new treatments for spinal cord injuryby giving an understanding of functional electrical stimulation that can be used not just to generate forces in target muscles, but can be used to generate smooth compliant control of dynamics in the way naturally used by the body."
"9545395","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Elastic tissues in series and in parallel with muscle have a profound influence on muscle mechanics and energetics. Planar elastic tissues including aponeurosis and fascia are intimately connected with muscles and only recently have we begun to understand the extent of their influence on muscle force, speed, and power. By forming a sheath around a large portion of the muscle belly, aponeurosis is hypothesized to govern the shape changes that muscle undergoes during contractions but this has never been directly tested. Through this influence on muscle shape, the aponeurosis may modulate the speed and force of contraction. Changes in connective tissue stiffness occur with age and disease and may interfere with the aponeurosis' ability to match muscle shape changes to muscle demand, which could have detrimental effects during damaging lengthening contractions. By modifying the structure and stiffness of the aponeurosis, this project will directly examine the role of aponeurosis in modulating muscle shape changes and test how similar alterations occurring after surgical intervention or with injury, age, or disease influence the mechanics of muscle contraction. This study will also explore the link between altered aponeurosis stiffness and muscle damage to address whether changes in aponeurosis properties related to age or disease increase the muscle's susceptibility to injury. The proposed experiment will use a novel 3D imaging technique to visualize the dynamic changes in muscle shape, muscle length, and fiber length in an in situ muscle preparation in a turkey. The specific aims of this project are: 1 to determine the role of the planar structure of aponeurosis in maintaining intramuscular pressure and modulating muscle force and speed during contractions; 2) to determine the role of aponeurosis stiffness in modulating muscle force and speed and preventing muscle damage. The results of the proposed experiments have the potential to improve surgical outcomes and inform rehabilitative strategies targeting connective tissue properties after injury or disease. Th proposed work will form the basis for future research investigating how planar connective tissues integrate function within and among muscles and between limb segments and incorporating planar connective tissues into musculoskeletal models of human movement to further explore how modifications of connective tissue properties related to injury, age, disease, or surgical intervention alter muscle and locomotor function."

The NC Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) conducted a vulnerability assessment and identified eight rural western counties with high rates of acute HCV, chronic HCV, and opioid overdose fatalities. RTI International, the University of NC at Chapel Hill, NC DHHS, local health departments (LHD), and the NC Harm Reduction Coalition are partnering in response to the RFA ?HIV, HCV and Related Comorbidities in Rural Communities Affected by Opioid Injection Drug Epidemics in the United States: Building Systems for Prevention, Treatment and Control.? Our team is ideally positioned in NC to develop, implement, and evaluate sustainable strategies for combatting opioid-associated adverse outcomes in rural people who inject drugs (PWID). The specific aims of the project by UG3/UH3 phase are as follows: UG3?1. Conduct 80 (10 per county) semistructured interviews with PWID; begin recruiting PWID using respondent-driven sampling (n=400) and LHDs and syringe service programs (SSPs; n=200); and use baseline self-reported data and HCV and HIV testing results to describe the care cascade for HCV, HIV, and substance use disorders. UG3?2. Survey (mail, electronic and telephone; n=150) LHD personnel, primary care, emergency/urgent care, and behavioral health care professionals (HCPs) in all eight counties to assess practice characteristics; awareness of and adherence to substance use, HCV, and HIV screening guidelines; and attitudes regarding implementation of SSPs, HCV care, and HIV care across practice settings. Conduct meetings with a subset of stakeholders. UG3?3. Informed by participants, identify health centers serving PWID in Jackson and Haywood counties, randomize implementation order, and train providers on prevention and treatment of HCV, HIV, and opioid overdoses. Assessing knowledge and practice patterns at baseline and 18 months after training (incentivized with continuing education units) will allow us to gauge training impact. After successful completion of UG3 activities, we will pursue the following aims in the UH3 phase: UH3?1. Complete PWID recruitment, conduct 6- and 12-month follow-up interviews to assess changes in substance use; sexual and injection risk behaviors; HCV and HIV testing; movement through the HCV and HIV care cascade; and utilization of new and expanded services, including SSPs and bridge counselors. UH3?2. Deploy electronic medical record-driven screening for HCV, HIV, and substance use; telehealth support for HCV and HIV treatment; and booster training to optimize services in our pilot clinic(s). Using this as a template, we will recruit, train, and optimize 2?3 additional local clinics to expand regional care access. UH3?3. Using follow-up LHD and HCP surveys in Year 5, epidemiological surveillance, and data on PWID linked to services by bridge counselors and providers trained, we will assess the impact on each care cascade and disseminate findings to local and state partners."
"9325509","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A process of branching morphogenesis underpins the formation of arborized epithelial networks in many organ systems including the lung and collecting duct system of the mammalian kidney. The collecting duct initiates on formation of the ureteric bud (UB) from the nephric duct. Cells at the bud tip, and at subsequent branch tips of the expanding ureteric epithelium, respond to inductive signals from the adjacent mesenchyme that promote and regulate branching morphogenesis, and maintain an uncommitted progenitor population at the branch tip. Progenitors exiting the tip to populate stalk regions differentiate ito the regionally distinct cell types of the collecting duct network. I aim to ascertain the unique molecular features of these tip cells to gain vital insights into stem cell dynamics and branching morphogenesis. I have utilized RNA sequencing data comparing gene expression in tip and stalk domains expression of the developing mouse kidney. These comparisons have identified a strong, tip-enriched set of genes that include all known tip regulatory genes from the literature. In Aim 1, I will perform a detailed in situ expression analysis of the tip- enriched gene set in th developing mouse kidney and lung to identify general and kidney specific regulators of epithelial morphogenesis. In Aim 2, I will develop a cell culture model of the ureteric tip population to systematically analyze the function of tip-enriched genes through genetic approaches. In Aim 3, I will explore the specific actions of Adamts18 (encoding a metalloproteinase with disintegrin-like and thrombospondin type 1 motif repeats) in the branching process. Adamts18 was identified as tip-enriched in both the kidney and lung. We have analyzed Adamts18 null mutants and shown that a subset of mutants display enlarged kidneys with double ureters. Thus, Adamts18 is normally required to restrict kidney branching and has emerged as a novel regulator of branching morphogenesis."
"9340050","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While it is clear that lifespan was extended during human evolution, there is remarkably little data available to assess the specific ways by which this remarkable change in life history came about. This missing information could importantly inform the understanding of how modern lifestyles, in interaction with our evolved biology, produce the health outcomes observed in developed countries. A major limitation at present is a dearth of data on the aging process in humans' closest evolutionary relative, the chimpanzee. The current study would be the first to gather comprehensive data on aging in wild chimpanzees, whose health has not been manipulated by humans during captive management or biomedical experimentation. Like humans during most of their evolutionary history, wild chimpanzees experience frequent nutritional stress and high rates of infectious disease and these processes - little studied in modern aging research - are expected to have shaped species-normative life history strategies. The project entails non-invasive collection of urine and feces from approximately 245 wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) for a broad range of health biomarkers, in additional to observational research for observed morbidity, locomotor proficiency, and social behavior. New data collection will complement and extend existing long-term demographic data, as well as individual histories of social interaction and reproductive effort. The wild data will be supplemented by additional blood-based biomarkers obtained during routine veterinary immobilizations of approximately 240 semi-free ranging chimpanzees in African sanctuaries. The project integrates investigators from major studies of health and aging in human foraging populations, and the central aim (1) of the project is to perform structured comparisons of health and aging between humans and chimpanzees. To further this goal, the additional project aims focus on key variables that are expected to shape senescence, and which are associated with prominent behavioral differences between species: (2) sex differences and the allocation of reproductive effort across the life history, (3) stability of accss to energy, and (4) social status and support. Information gathered in pursuit of these aims has specific relevance to prominent focuses of human aging research: the gender morbidity-mortality paradox, caloric restriction, and the influences of chronic stress and social subordination."
"9353790","PROGRAM SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Substantial progress has been made in developing effective diabetes prevention and care programs; however, significant gaps remain. A major gap is suboptimal uptake, adoption, and sustained use of evidence-based prevention and care programs, especially among minorities and underserved populations. To close this gap, there is a clear, cogent, and compelling public health priority to conduct methodologically rigorous and innovative diabetes translation research. Effective translation research can efficiently identify ways to improve uptake, adoption, utilization, and maintained engagement with evidence-based prevention and care programs. Core C (Engagement and Behavior Change) is well-positioned to catalyze this sort of diabetes translation research by leveraging its multidisciplinary expertise, its extensive experience in community- and clinic-based research, its access to ethnic minority physician practice networks, and its access to ethnic minority communities and clinical populations. The Core has extensive breadth and depth of experience and expertise in community-based participatory research (CBPR) with minority disadvantaged communities and clinical populations. Though these are often underrepresented populations in translation research, Core C brings experience in facilitating their ethical recruitment, retention, and sustained engagement in health promotion and research activities. Core Faculty also have extensive experience and expertise in the application of user- friendly mobile- and computer-based technologies to accelerate adoption and maintenance of health behaviors. The Core is also proficient in designing user-friendly technology for enhancing the quality, efficiency and cost-effective collection of participants' self-reported data. Core C will also partner with other Center Cores and Programs to implement a coordinated, innovative ?multidisciplinary team approach? to mentor early career investigators. To support researchers, the Core will develop specific products and services, such as User Guides (user-friendly and free PDFs and expert videos) to enhance understanding of the importance of CBPR principles and practices and to promote use of CBPR; assist in design and application of new technology to optimize translation research; and provide guidance on the applicability of technology to enhance the quality and efficiency of data collection. Core C will also provide direct consultation for investigators, in-person or via web-assisted video-based technology (this latter strategy is efficient and cost-effective in providing consultation to geographically disparate investigators). Core C will track utilization and impact of services via Google analytics for website-accessed products (type, number, and frequency of tools accessed and/or downloaded) and by requesting all Core users complete web-administered client satisfaction scales. This data will be used to monitor and improve the quality and usefulness of Core products and services. Core C's services may be instrumental in catalyzing research, particularly for minority populations, that will advance the field of diabetes translation research."
"9520880","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is the most common form of HF and is nearly unique to the older persons. Exercise intolerance is the primary manifestation of HFpEF and severely reduces quality-of- life (QOL). However, its pathophysiology is poorly understood and its optimal treatment remains undefined. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that increased adiposity and abnormalities in skeletal muscle are major contributors to exercise intolerance in older HFpEF patients. Obesity is one of the strongest risk factors for HFpEF, and 85% of older HFpEF patients have the overweight/obese phenotype. We have found that HFpEF patients have reduced total lean mass, increased thigh muscle fat infiltration, reduced capillarity and percent type I fibers, and trends for reduced mitochondrial mass and function; all of which were related to reduced peak VO2. In our recent study in obese older HFpEF patients, both caloric restriction (CR) and aerobic exercise training (AT) increased peak VO2 equally and their combination was strongly additive and improved QOL. Improved peak VO2 was related to reduced fat mass, increased percent lean mass, improved thigh muscle composition and trends for increased mitochondrial mass and function, which were greatest with CR. These data strongly support combined CR+AT as a novel treatment for HFpEF. However, about 35% of the weight lost during CR was muscle mass and was not prevented by AT. This muscle mass loss is a concern because it could have hindered the gains in peak VO2, and has been associated with increased disability, hospitalizations, and death. Thus, a logical next step is to build on our successes by finding strategies to further increase peak VO2 during CR+AT by retaining muscle mass and improving mitochondrial function. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that resistance training (RT) could be an ideal addition to CR+AT for HFpEF. In other populations, RT increases muscle mass and mitochondrial function, and increases peak VO2 in magnitude similar to AT and the two have additive and complementary effects. We reported that RT during CR in obese older non-HF adults reduces loss of muscle mass nearly 50%. In our pilot study, we found that RT improves mitochondrial function in older obese adults. However RT has not been tested in HFpEF or during CR in any type of HF. The primary aim of the proposed study is to conduct a randomized, single-blinded 24- week intervention trial of RT added to CR+AT in 100 overweight/obese (BMI > 28), HFpEF patients age >60 years to test the hypotheses that addition of resistance training to AT during CR will improve peak VO2 and will increase muscle mass. A secondary, mechanistic aim will determine if the addition of RT to CR+AT improves muscle mitochondrial function. If successful, this innovative study will define the optimal non- pharmacological intervention for exercise intolerance in the growing population of overweight/obese older HFpEF patients. It will also: advance a new paradigm regarding the role of muscle in HFpEF pathophysiology, test a novel intervention, and provide the first mechanistic insights regarding mitochondrial function in HFpEF."
"9334297","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our goal in this project is to overcome major barriers preventing MRI from being the clinical standard for carotid disease evaluation. Carotid MRI is unique in that it has the potential to accurately measure vulnerable plaque markers in addition to the clinically relevant measurement of percent diameter stenosis. In addition to carotid stenosis, studies using MRI in the research setting have found that carotid intraplaque inflammation (IPI), intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH), necrotic core (NC), and fibrous cap (FC) thickness and disruption are important stroke risk factors. Although MRI has the potential to measure these factors, major barriers still exist to using carotid MRI in the clinical setting. These include 1) he lack of a coil specific to the anatomic location of the carotid bifurcation in all patients and 2) he lack of high-resolution MRI sequences to accurately measure lumen, stenosis, and plaque components in the presence of respiratory, cardiac, and swallowing motion.  In this project we will: 1) develop a novel carotid imaging coil with modular interchangeable arrays on formers that match the range of patient neck anatomy encountered; 2) develop innovative pulse sequences to accurately measure carotid lumen, stenosis and plaque components; 3) develop pulse sequence methods and reconstruction algorithms to detect and correct motion-corrupted measurements; and 4) validate these results by comparison with histology. The development of tailor-made subject fitting RF coils will increase SNR and allow higher spatial and temporal resolution. This increased SNR from the modular coils coupled with motion- robust sequences will increase accuracy of identifying in-vivo plaque components. This will lay the foundation for future studies using carotid MRI to optimally characterize stroke risk and monitor treatment effects geared toward decreasing IPI, IPH, NC, and stabilizing the FC. These methods that conveniently, consistently, and accurately depict carotid lumen and plaque components will overcome the major barriers to the use of MRI as the clinical standard in characterizing carotid disease. This will facilitate the transition of carotid MRI from the research setting where MRI methods have been developed to the general clinic where benefit to the individual patient will be obtained and costs to society will ultimately be reduced."
"9529952","While the military has taken steps to reduce tobacco use over the past two decades, over a quarter of new military recruits report regular tobacco and nicotine containing product (TNCP) use prior to enlistment.2 This rate is higher than the national prevalence of 21.3% of US adults.17 Brief health prevention programs may be particularly effective for Airmen in Technical Training, given that all Airmen have been tobacco free for 11 ½ weeks and nearly 2/3rds are confident that they won't return to TNCPs. We have developed and validated23 a Brief Tobacco Intervention (BTI) that is currently being implemented as part of Technical Training. We found that a motivational interviewing based, 40 minute BTI was efficacious in increasing perceived harm and decreasing intentions to use TNCPs in a sample of 1055 Air Force trainees. Although we obtained significant positive changes in latent cognitive constructs for tobacco behavior that are highly predictive of future TNCP use in youth and young adults,24-29 the Little et al study did not obtain measures of actual TNCP resumption following the ban on TNCPs in Air Force training. Given that 69.8% of all TNCP resumption/initiation occurs in Technical Training,18 a study that evaluates the short-term impact of our BTI on actual TNCP use is necessary prior to conducting the full scale R01 that would evaluate the long term efficacy of the BTI intervention. Thus, we propose the following Specific Aims: (1) To recruit approximately 2,000 Air Force trainees at the beginning of Technical Training at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland Air Force in San Antonio, TX during the 11 ½ week involuntary cessation ban; (2) To randomize participants to either (a) receive our cigarette smoking military tailored pamphlet (HL095758), The Airmen's Guide to Remaining Tobacco Free (Airmen's Guide; which has been disseminated and is now the standard of care in the Air Force) or (b) the Airmen's Guide + Brief Tobacco Intervention (BTI); (3) To determine the short-term (3 month, end of Technical Training) efficacy of the intervention on TNCP abstinence. Our primary outcome is TNCP abstinence at the end of Technical Training to determine an estimated effect size as well as establish the requisite preliminary work for a subsequent R01. Given that over 220,000 new recruits enter the military annually in one of the service branches,30 the public health implications of an effective brief tobacco intervention targeting the most commonly used TNCPs for military personnel in Technical Training is considerable. If the BTI is proven efficacious it can be easily disseminated to other service branches that have similar tobacco bans during Technical Training."
"9319164","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center Flow Cytometry Core Facility provides comprehensive flow cytometry and cell sorting services. The Flow Cytometry Core Facility serves investigators of the Cancer Center, Northwestern University Medical School, Northwestern University and other affiliated institutions by providing access to routine flow cytometry assays such as immunophenotyping and DNA analysis. However, the major mission of the facility is to provide the guidance, technical assistance, and equipment for investigators to utilize more complex multi-parametric, multi-laser measurements as well as cell sorting in their research regardless of their level of cytometry expertise. The Core Facility has an international reputation and extensive experience in developing and implementing complex multi-parametric assays with particular expertise in intracellular liable antigen detection such as phosphorylated protein epitopes. This level of expertise along with the equipment housed within the Core Facility permits implementation of most flow cytometry assays that have been published. Services provided by the facility extend from consultation on experimental design, sample preparation and data analysis to instrument operation and set-up for cell sorting and multi-laser operation. In addition, the Core Facility has an active program of assay development guided by the interests/needs of the investigators. Reflective of the facility's commitment to flow cytometry education/ training of the next generation of researchers, user training for operation of not only less complex analysis instruments but also the more complex analyzer and sorting instruments is offered. Thus, the Flow Cytometry Core Facility serves as a focus for individuals interested in cellular based measurements and cellular heterogeneity in disease providing critical support for cancer related research within the institution. The Chicago campus facility includes three cell sorters; a 5 laser/15 parameter MoFlo high speed cell sorter (Beckman-Coulter. BC) along with two new Becton-Dickinson (BD) FACSAria 111 cell sorters, a 4 laser/13 parameter instrument and a 5 laser/17 parameter instrument housed in a Bio-containment hood and negative pressure room; and a 3 laser, 10 parameter FACSAria II (BD) on the Evanston campus. The Chicago campus facility also has three benchtop flow cytometry analyzers; a 6 laser/18 parameter FORTESSA (BD), a 3 laser/11 parameter Cyan (BC) and a single laser/six parameter XL (BC) with the Evanston facility having a 4 laser/13 parameter LSRII (BD). In addition, the Chicago facility has a ViCell cell counter/viability instrument (BC). The facility has multiple offline analysis workstations providing the components for post acquisition data analysis and graphics generation. The Core Facility is now heavily utilized by a wide number of investigators (148), approximately 62% of which are Cancer Center members who account for approximately 74% of core utilization."
"9325056","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  In response to the preovulatory LH surge, the preovulatory follicle rapidly increases progesterone production, which is essential for ovulation and/or corpus luteum formation. Although this rise in progesterone level has been mainly linked to a few LH-induced genes involved in steroidogenesis (e.g., StAR, Cypi 1 a l , and HSD3b), but there are many gaps in our understanding of periovulatory accumulation of progesterone.  In this proposal, we put forward a novel protein, CIPAR1 (castration-induced prostatic apoptosis-related protein 1), as a vital mediator of progesterone accumulation in the periovulatory follicle. We have recently demonstrated the LH surge increases the expression of Ciparl in periovulatory follicles of rodent ovaries. More importantly, our preliminary study using granulosa cell cultures showed that knockdown of Ciparl expression resulted in significant reduction of progesterone levels. Based on these novel findings, we hypothesize that induction of CIPAR1 by the LH surge is crucial for progesterone accumulation in periovulatory follicles, thus ovulation and luteinization. In specific Aim#1, we will demonstrate that the alteration of Ciparl expression by silencing or over-expression affects progesterone production in rat periovulatory follicles using both in vivo and in vitro models. As the first approach to pinpoint the functional contribution of C1PAR1 in periovulatory follicles, we will identify the genes and proteins that are differentially expressed when Ciparl expression is silenced or over-expressed in periovulatory follicles. Because littie is known about cellular function of CIPAR1, Specific Aim #2 focuses on first determining the cellular location of  CIPAR1 in periovulatory granulosa cells using confocal co-localization and/or subcellular fractionated protein analyses and then identifying CIPAR1 interacting proteins in periovulatory granulosa cells using immunoprecipitation, followed by a proteomic approach. Other than our preliminary data detecting Ciparl expression in human granulosa cells, nothing is known about CIPAR1 in human tissues. In collaboration with Drs. Brannstrum and Duffy, specific Aim #3 will determine whether Ciparl expression is hormonally  regulated during the periovulatory period and critical for LH-induced progesterone production in humans and/or macaques. Data obtain from the proposed studies will unravel the role of C1PAR1 as a novel and critical mediator of progesterone accumulation in periovulatory follicles of primates as well as rodents."
"9382938","PROJECT SUMMARY  Significant progress has been made in the development and refinement of diagnostic measures for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, these measures do not capture fine-grained changes in social- communication that occur over time or in response to treatment. Existing measures of social-communication are also strongly influenced by developmental level, thus making scores difficult to compare across children with ASD or other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) who differ in age and ability. Given the wide range of cognitive abilities observed in children with ASD, and recent advances in the identification of multiple genetic syndromes associated with ASD and varying levels of intellectual disability, there is increasing need for measures that assess social-communication abilities while accounting for development (both age and IQ). The lack of instruments to quantify social-communication ability relative to developmental level and sensitive to incremental change poses a major obstacle for treatment studies in particular.  The specific objective of the proposed research is to create and validate a measure of social- communication ability that can be used to describe baseline levels of ability and subsequent stability or change in children with ASD and other NDDs. Scores will be standardized within specific developmental cells (age x IQ), thus pre-emptively managing the substantial measurement challenges caused by variability in how behaviors manifest in children of different ages and abilities. The new measure will be specifically designed to be sensitive to gains associated with the continuation of development, as well as to incremental treatment- related improvements in skills that may be obscured by broad measures of impairment (e.g., diagnostic tools). Phase 1 of the project will involve analyses of existing ASD symptom measures from more than 10,000 assessments of children with ASD (n=7,838), non-ASD NDD (n=1,595), or typical development (TD) (n=636) in order to identify constructs that are most relevant to social-communication ability within developmental cells, and that are maximally responsive to developmental changes. Items will be written from the identified constructs and designed for a computer-adaptive testing format (CAT). This will allow for complex skip patterns that tailor content within particular developmental windows, and will facilitate web-based distribution of the tool. During Phase 2, the candidate item pool will be administered via computer- or tablet-based administration to parents of children with ASD or other NDDs across multiple clinical sites (projected ASD n=930, projected non- ASD NDD n=670), and via the internet to parents of non-clinically referred children (projected n=400), in order to evaluate the dimensionality of the proposed new measure (Phase 2a), and cross-validate and calibrate the items that perform as expected (Phase 2b). In Phase 3, the final item bank will be field tested via the CAT prototype with 100 clinical or research referrals with ASD or non-ASD NDD. The resulting measure will provide information about a child's social-communication abilities relative to an age- and IQ-matched reference group."
"9384148","Obesity increases both the incidence and mortality of numerous types of cancer. Children and adults who are obese at the time of diagnosis of high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have a 50% increased risk of relapse compared to their lean counterparts. Using mouse and tissue culture models, we showed that obesity directly impacts the progression and treatment outcome of ALL. We discovered that adipocytes protect ALL cells from a number of chemotherapies, including the anthracycline daunorubicin (DNR). We have found that fat cells break down DNR to an inactive form, which depletes local levels and protects nearby ALL cells from this chemotherapy.  In the present grant, we will further elucidate this mechanism, using a combination of cell culture, mouse experiments, and clinical studies. We will first investigate which enzymes in adipocytes contribute to their ability to breakdown anthracyclines like DNR, and explore strategies to block these enzymes. We will use mouse models to determine how adipocytes in vivo alter systemic DNR availability, as well as that in the bone marrow and other ALL microenvironments. We will also explore how clinical variables such as age and gender alter these effects. Finally, we will perform a limited sampling PK study in lean and obese children, to estimate DNR and DNR-ol plasma and intracellular exposure during ALL therapy. These studies will increase our understanding of how the leukemia microenvironment can contribute to treatment failure, particularly in the obese state. Findings could lead to improved strategies for anthracycline dosing and monitoring in children and adults. These results, along with our previous studies on how adipocytes affect vincristine and L-asparaginase PK and PD, will lay the groundwork for a personalized dosing study of Induction chemotherapies in children with ALL."
"9306703","PROJECT SUMMARY Social and health scientists share a long-standing interest in trends in inequality, for example, health dispari- ties. But they have largely ignored the lagged selection bias that is prevalent in trend studies and can render comparison of the groups invalid over time. Lagged selection bias occurs when there is a secular change in the dynamics of selection into treatment and control groups. If the mechanism of selection into these groups changes over time, the simple comparison in the outcome across treatment groups will be naïve because these treatment groups are not the same. Without recognizing and solving the lagged selection bias, studies may yield artefactual trends in health disparities and make misleading suggestions for public policy makers. The overall objective of this proposed project is to propose a semi-parametric approach to mitigate the lagged selection bias under the counterfactual framework, complemented with a difference-in-difference approach to further remove the universal period effects for treatment and control groups. This approach promises to change survey design in ways that will make this approach feasible for all the trend studies. More specifically, this proposal intends to reach four aims. Aim 1: Establish a counterfactual framework to create comparable treatment and control groups between two time points using propensity score matching or weighting methods. Then I will complement these methods with a difference-in-difference approach to estimate the changes in health disparities. Aim 2: Extend these methods to multiple time points to estimate the trends in health dispari- ties over a long period of time. Aim 3: Extend these methods to multiple time points and multiple-valued caus- es to estimate the trends in health disparities over a long period of time. Aim 4: Evaluate the lagged selection bias in health disparities trends studies using NCHS (National Center for Health Statistics) data (e.g., National Health Interview Survey) and suggest ways to improve the surveys in order to adequately use the methods de- veloped in this project. The endogeneity problem is one of the major threats for causal inference in observa- tional studies. Even though sufficient attention has been paid to cross-sectional designs and cohort study de- sign, not enough attention has been focused on the lagged selection bias in trend studies using pooled cross- sectional designs. This project is innovative because it develops an unprecedented method to mitigate the lagged selection bias in trend studies using pooled cross-sectional design under the ignorability assumption. This method will fill the gap in the current methodology of causal inference. This project's focus is on the trends in health disparities, but the methods developed here are readily applicable to other contexts."
"9352840","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate, Dr. Amir Zarrinpar, presents a 5-year career development plan that seeks to characterize the relationship of the gut microbiome and metabolism while establishing an academic career as a physician scientist in the field of gastroenterology. Obesity and its associated metabolic disease afflict more than one third of the population of the United States and are a source of considerable morbidity and mortality. Dr. Zarrinpar and his colleagues co-discovered time restricted feeding (TRF), a paradigm that preserves normal feeding/fasting cycles and prevents obesity and other metabolic disorders associated with a high fat diet. By maintaining the natural feeding rhythms without altering nutritional intake, mice on a TRF protocol do not become obese or have hallmarks of dysmetabolism. However, the mechanism for TRF still remains elusive, though it likely alters gut luminal signaling and the gut microbiome. Our primary hypothesis for the proposed studies is that TRF imparts its beneficial effects by altering the gut microbiome and the genes that the microflora express (i.e. the metatranscriptome). This hypothesis will be pursued with three specific aims that investigate the relationship between the gut microbiome, metabolism, and gut gene expression in context of the TRF paradigm. Specific aim 1 tests the hypothesis that specific TRF-induced changes protect against obesity by altering host-microbiome homeostasis and luminal signaling. TRF will help identify a small set of candidate bacterial species/genes that play a protective role and another set that play a detrimental role in metabolism. Specific aim 2 tests the hypothesis that TRF's beneficial effects result from changes in the gut microbiome. The microbiome will be changed by either using antibiotics, shared bedding in wild-type mice, or transplantation into germ-free mice. Lastly, specific aim 3 tests the hypothesis that the gut microbiome and TRF mediate their beneficial effects through bile acid signaling pathways. By pharmacologically manipulating this signaling pathway, its necessity in mediating the beneficial effects of TRF and gut microbiome changes can be observed. These specific aims will help us understand the role of gut microbiome to intestinal homeostasis, gut gene expression, and luminal signaling. The anticipated results of these experiments are that the gut microbiome is a dynamic environment with cyclical changes in microflora populations and their gene expressions. Diet induced obesity disrupts this dynamic environment and selects for obesogenic bacteria. TRF on the other hand, maintains the cyclical changes in the gut microbiome and selects for obesity-protective species in the microflora. Any changes in the microbiome will be correlated to changes in the gut gene expression to find physiological consequences of these shifts. Alteration of the gut microbiome in antibiotic induced microbiome depletion and germ-free mice would confirm that microbiome changes are necessary for the metabolic phenotype observed in these mice. Furthermore, the bile acid signaling pathway is the main way that the gut microbiome mediates its protection against obesity. The three specific aims proposed will substantially advance our understanding of the physiological role that the gut microbiome plays in metabolism. By better understanding the gut microbiome's relationship to intestinal homeostasis, gut gene expression, and luminal signaling, these pathways can then be physiologically manipulated to treat and prevent obesity and its associated metabolic diseases. Dr. Zarrinpar is well qualified to carry out the research outlined in this proposal. He has successfully completed projects of comparable complexity as part of his PhD thesis. He will further his training by acquiring expertise in performing high quality gut microbiome experiments as well as further establish expertise in circadian biology, metabolic regulation, and intestinal homeostasis. Dr. Zarrinpar has recruited a team of outstanding mentors from three different local institutions. His mentor, Dr. Satchidananda Panda, has experience in studying circadian circuitry and using genetic, genomic, and biochemical approaches to identify numerous genes that are under circadian regulation. Dr. Mark Adams, Professor and Scientific Director of J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI) will provide expertise in studying the gut microbiome. Dr. Christopher Glass, who has extensive experience training physician scientists, will advise him on major career related issues and help navigate the academic promotion process. In addition, Dr. Sheila Crowe, a nationally recognized educator and mentor, will serve on the advisory committee. She will mentor Dr. Zarrinpar as he finds translational and clinical applications of the studies proposed in his application. The advisory committee will meet, at minimum, every 6 months to ensure a successful scientific program. Successful completion of the specific aims and career development plan outlined in this proposal will allow Dr. Zarrinpar to learn how to perform high quality gut microbiome projects and to develop into an independent investigator in the field of gastroenterology and metabolism."
"9527214","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Drug addiction is a chronically relapsing disease associated with deficits in brain function and structure in regions that underlie reward processing and self-control, manifesting as a pernicious syndrome of impaired response inhibition and salience attribution (iRISA). This syndrome is likely further modulated by select genetic variations that precede and/or exacerbate the addiction, evidenced by studies that have examined the influence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on brain and behavior. However, this approach is fundamentally limited insofar as individual SNPs (e.g., DAT1, MAOA) are likely to explain only a small portion of behavior in complex disorders such as addiction. To move the field forward, this proposal seeks to implement an innovative analysis pipeline to fundamentally expand upon the menu of genetic factors that may contribute to cocaine addiction (i.e., beyond traditional candidate genes) while simultaneously avoiding the potential pitfalls of genome-wide association (GWAS) studies (i.e., insufficient statistical power). The analysis pipeline proceeds according to the following steps, which will be applied to an already-collected sample (Sample 1) and a new, ongoing sample (Sample 2): (A) probing for group differences between individuals with cocaine use disorder (iCUD) and healthy controls (HC) in structural gray matter volume (GMV), a reliable and robust neuroimaging modality; (B) for those regions exhibiting between-group differences, using a freely-available brain Atlas to map and identify gene SNPs, coexpression networks, and region-specific transcripts; and (C) using DNA samples for empirical testing of these same select genes, SNPs, and networks in iCUD and HC for verification of influence. For Sample 2 specifically, an additional primary outcome of interest is the prospective prediction of future drug use in iCUD, assessed as part of 4 follow-up study sessions with multiple, valid objective and subjective drug use probes. In sum, this study uses a novel data-driven imaging genetics approach to identify previously uncharacterized genetic differences between iCUD and HC, which in turn will be used to correlate with brain morphology and predict drug-relevant outcomes in cocaine addiction."
"9366917","Project Summary  While mucus barriers provide natural protection from pathogens and allow for passage of nutrients, loss of homeostasis in diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF) results in abnormal mucus secretions with dysfunctional clearance mechanisms. As a result, most morbidity and mortality in CF patients from advanced lung disease is in part due to the altered mucus microenvironment. In CF, the local mucus environment not only promotes the development of chronic bacterial infections, but it is hyperconcentrated and viscous, preventing effective penetration of therapeutics through the barrier to correct the affected epithelia or infections. To improve delivery and efficacy of therapeutics, it is critical to enhance therapeutic penetration through the mucus barrier. Current strategies have focused on hydrophilic, net-neutral charge polymers to improve transport and minimize interactions with mucus. However, current technology may be immunogenic after repeated dosing and may demonstrate suboptimal cellular uptake. Also, it is unclear if current technology achieves maximum transport, and studies have been limited to a small number of testable formulations with uniform surface chemistries, which may not be optimal interfaces for mucus penetration. Using bacterial viruses, i.e. bacteriophage, we have identified phage-presenting peptides from a large combination of random peptides (107-109) that are mucus-inert and facilitate transport through the mucus barrier.  From this finding, the objective of this proposal is to develop chitosan nanoparticles that mimic mucus- penetrating bacteriophage and deliver CRISPR/Cas9 targeting defective CFTR mutations to treat cell culture and animal models of cystic fibrosis. We hypothesize that our chitosan nanoparticles will achieve effective complexation of CRISPR/Cas9 nucleic acids, and functionalization of these nanoparticles with mucus-inert peptides will successfully overcome the mucus barrier for effective gene delivery into the diseased epithelia. We further propose that the composition and distribution of penetrating peptides will change transport behavior in mucus. To test these hypotheses, the specific aims of this work will focus on the following: (1) develop chitosan CRISPR/Cas9 complexes coated with mucus penetrating peptides; (2) validate rapid transport of these nanoparticles by particle tracking microscopy and perform mutagenesis studies to dissect the amino acids responsible for facilitating mucus penetration; and (3) confirm delivery and gene correction of defective CF bronchial epithelium cell lines and animal model of CF. The proposed work is innovative because by mimicking mucus-penetrating bacteriophage, we will have developed a new class of synthetic chitosan nanoparticles capable of targeted genomic editing for therapy. The significance of the proposed work is bacterial viruses provided the inspiration for design of new gene targeting delivery systems, and from this work, we can begin to understand physicochemical properties impacts transport, and thus, will provide comprehensive design principles to develop more effective gene and drug delivery through mucus barriers.     "
"9363390","Abstract  The CDC lists MDR Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Ng) as one of the three most urgent antibiotic resistance threats in the United States. A Gram-negative fastidious organism, Ng causes gonorrhea, the second-most prevalent sexually transmitted bacterial infection (STI) with >800,000 estimated cases in the United States annually. Left untreated, gonorrhea can cause pelvic inflammatory disease in women, leading to fallopian tube scarring and infertility or may disseminate, causing joint and skin manifestations. Once easily treatable, Ng has evolved resistance to nearly every antibiotic used to treat it, leaving a combination of azithromycin (AZM) and ceftriaxone (CTX) as the only currently available treatment option. Importantly, a cluster of cases was recently reported in Hawaii that was resistant to both AZM and CTX, highlighting the critical need for new therapeutics targeting antibiotic-resistant Ng infections.  Bacterial translation is plagued by transcription errors, mRNA damage, and translational frameshifting events that result in non-stop ribosome complexes, preventing release of protein products and inhibiting further translation. Recovery of non-stop complexes is a crucial bacterial process mediated by trans-translation, ArfA or ArfB acting on a region of the bacterial ribosome highly conserved across all sequenced bacterial genomes. In preliminary studies, we demonstrated that oxadiazole-based compounds inhibit non-stop ribosome rescue, acting as potent antimicrobials against a range of pathogens, including Ng, with MIC90 values against Ng ranging from 0.8-1.6 µM (0.25-0.54 µg/mL). These compounds exhibit minimal toxicity towards mammalian cells, excellent pharmacokinetics and in vivo antibiotic activity in a F. tularensis mouse model.  The objective of this proposal is to optimize the lead oxadiazole inhibitor of non-stop ribosome rescue into a novel class of broad-spectrum therapeutic agents for use against Neisseria gonorrhoeae and to advance this compound towards Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling GLP toxicology and safety pharmacology studies and pre-IND submission. We will accomplish seven specific aims to achieve this objective: In Aim 1 we will optimize the lead series through SAR-driven analog generation. In Aim 2 we will prioritize lead series analogs through in vitro biology and ADME evaluations. In Aim 3 we will confirm and further explore mechanism of action and specificity of oxadiazole inhibitors of non-stop ribosome rescue in Ng. In Aim 4 we will select a preclinical candidate and backup based on in vivo properties. In Aim 5 we will conduct IND-enabling pharmacokinetic, toxicology and safety pharmacology studies. In Aim 6 we will perform CMC studies, targeting 1 non-GMP patch of drug substance at a GMP manufacturer. In Aim 7 we will request a pre-IND meeting with the FDA."
"9303458","Our previous work has shown that the glia (Schwann cells, SCs) at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) participate in the removal of polyneuronal innervation during early postnatal development in mice. They do this by interposing themselves between the nerve terminals and the muscle fibers and by phagocytosis of the nerve terminals themselves. However, what is unclear is what causes these SCs to behave in this destructive manner. Our hypothesis is that some signal, likely from the nerve, engages this activity and that this signal is developmentally regulated. Here we propose a series of experiments that follow up on preliminary results that strongly suggest that the nerve membrane-linked isoform of a trophic factor called neuregulin 1 type III might play this role. Schwann cells are known to be responsive to this signaling. We propose to use light microscopy, electron microscopy, molecular biology, and physiology to examine the developmental expression of this isoform during early postnatal development and the consequences of manipulating the expression of this isoform, and its receptor by use of transgenic and knockout mice. If our hypotheses are correct, then the display of neuregulin by motor axons to receptive SCs is at least part of the mechanism controlling the behavior of these cells at the synapse. Not only will these findings add to the existing knowledge about the roles of neuregulin in trophic maintenance and myelination activity of SCs, they will also suggest mechanisms by which these glial cells might participate in events that compromise synaptic function during aging, neuromuscular disease, and repair of nerve injuries."
"9238166","Abstract  Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is characterized by heavy proteinuria and increased risk of loss of kidney function. It causes serious morbidity and high mortality, accounting for 15% of prevalent end-stage renal disease at an annual cost of more than $3 billion in the US. There is no effective treatment for most cases of NS caused by genetic mutations. Our research has been focused on a monogenic form of NS caused by a missense mutation (C321R) of LAMB2, one of the most commonly mutated genes in NS. Laminin 2 encoded by LAMB2 is a component of laminin-521 ( 5 2 1), the major laminin trimer of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). Using our established knockout/transgenic mouse model, we have found that podocyte endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and subsequent defective secretion of misfolded C321R-LAMB2 from podocytes to the GBM lead to proteinuria. Furthermore, we have recently discovered an ER soluble factor that promotes the survival of ER-stressed podocytes.  The overall goals of this proposal are to delineate molecular mechanisms regulating important death and survival pathways activated by the C321R-LAMB2 mutation-induced podocyte ER stress, to determine the contribution of podocyte ER stress in NS patients carrying putative deleterious missense variants, and to investigate novel treatment strategies for genetic forms of NS. To accomplish our research goals, we will utilize mouse genetic models and access two major human NS cohorts, Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE) and the Washington University Kidney Translational Research Core (WU KTRC). We have assembled an interdisciplinary team including multiple co-investigators and collaborators with the required expertise in pioneering ER stress research, human and mouse genetics, next generation sequencing, and high throughput screening.  The proposed study will help us classify NS patients based on underlying molecular mechanisms, stratify disease risk, and discover highly-targeted treatments for NS patients caused by podocyte ER dysfunction."
"9348972","Prostate cancer is lethal when it metastasizes to the liver. We have identified for the first time that a steatotic hepatitis (fatty liver) is significantly more receptive to prostate cancer cells than a normal healthy liver. The Veteran population is predisposed to PCa liver metastasis as they have the multiple risk factors for fatty liver. In the course of this proposal our objective is to determine the mechanism of this interesting metastatic phenomena. We have demonstrated that the fatty liver and the primary prostate cancer microenvironment have multiple lines of similarity, including neuroendocrine differentiation of the epithelia, tenascin C matrix expression, and endoglin expression in the tumor stromal cells. We have reported that TGF-ß signaling in the tumor microenvironment in the primary tumor site or the secondary metastatic site mediates paracrine signaling dictate the expansion and therapeutic resistance of the associated cancer epithelia. The endoglin receptor is a member of the TGF-ß receptor family that is critical for the switching from the downstream Smad2/3 to the Smad1/5 signaling. This signaling switch can be the determinant for TGF-ß going from an anti- tumorigenic role to that of a pro-tumorigenic role. Preliminary data support the induction of fatty acid oxidation in the primary tumor and hepatocytes downstream of endoglin as a determinant of tumor epithelial expansion at both primary tumor and metastatic site. In turn, we found that fatty acid metabolism can induce endoglin expression. We will specifically test the hypothesis that, elevated CD105-fatty acid oxidation axis in the PCa microenvironment is supportive of its expansion in the primary and liver metastatic site through the following aims: Aim. 1. Define the role of CD105 and fatty acid oxidation plays in PCa-associated fibroblasts to support PCa expansion. Aim. 2. Define the role of CD105 and fatty acid oxidation plays in hepatocytes to support PCa expansion. We will interrogate both stromal and epithelial contributions to the generation and maintenance of a lethal PCa phenotype in the liver. We will use in vivo tissue recombination and patient derived xenograft systems to study the interactions of altered cancer-associated fibroblasts and cancer cells. We will for the first time evaluate endoglin antagonism as a means of limiting PCa liver metastasis. Our studies will leverage access to human tissues from the well-annotated VA Hospital System. Understanding a mechanism for why the fatty liver microenvironment supports PCa tumors and determining how the PCa adapts to the metastatic microenvironment are the goals of this project."
"9280420","SUMMARY (PROJECT 1) Anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor redirected T cells (CART-19) have been dramatically successful for some patients with B-cell malignancies. We and others have shown complete response (CR) rates of over 90% in patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) ALL. Many of these remissions are sustained, but the major limitation is relapse in 20-50% of patients and two-thirds of these relapses involve CD19-negative ALL. In patients with r/r CLL treated with anti-CD19 CAR T cells, complete response rates are lower at 20-25%, but relapse after remission is very unusual. In addition, there are also many patients with B cell malignancies who cannot benefit from CAR T cells because of the inability to collect or manufacture T cells, especially from intensively treated patients with low T cell counts and from infants. In addition, some patients will rapidly progress before manufacturing is complete and cannot tolerate or survive the necessary treatment delay. This project will use a comprehensive strategy to target the major limitations in CAR T cell therapy, increasing the feasibility of this already transformational approach by looking both at T cell-intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms of resistance as well as ALL cell-intrinsic mechanisms that lead to relapse. We will take advantage of already established successful collaborations with core laboratories with expertise in gene editing, as well as state of the art correlative science to explore a number of innovative aims. We have designed studies to understand the biology and mechanisms underlying both CD19 negative and CD19 positive relapse in ALL. In CLL, where response rates are a more significant barrier than relapse, we will explore the role that checkpoint molecules, the tumor microenvironment, and the leukemia cell itself plays in inducing resistance to CTL019. To do this, we will capitalize on our unique bank of specimens derived from over 200 patients treated at Children's Hospital and U Penn with CTL019. Finally, we have designed high impact clinical trials 1) testing methods to limit CD19 negative relapse in ALL (by targeting CD19 and CD22 concurrently) and 2) enhancing responses in B cell malignancies by testing gene-edited, CAR modified allogeneic T cells (?PACE? CARs). PACE CARs are pre-manufactured, ?universal donor? CAR+ cells that are gene-edited with CRISPR technology to eliminate T cell receptors and HLA class I molecules. These cells could be used across HLA barriers and should not cause GVHD or be rapidly rejected. Therefore, they can solve unmet medical needs in autologous CAR therapy where i) there is a high degree of clinical urgency (cells are immediately available); ii) there has been a failure to collect adequate T cells or manufacture autologous CAR cells; and iii) where autologous CTL019 has failed to induce B cell aplasia and/or clinical response. This research will be highly significant because it will lead to detailed understanding of mechanisms of resistance to CTL019, provide information that can be rapidly translated for clinical testing, and perform highly innovative clinical trials attempting to enhance outcomes for patients who currently have no effective treatment options."

"9304367","Research under the current proposal is designed to determine behavioral alterations relevant to schizophrenia (SZ), which is elicited by activation of stress-associated cascades and the E-I imbalance in the prefrontal cortex in mouse models that carry microtubule-associated genetic variants. We will also study how adolescent social isolation exacerbates these changes at the molecular, circuitry, and behavioral levels in collaboration with three Projects. In addition to performing basic behavioral characterization of the mouse models, this Core will conduct behavioral assessments for neurocognitive domains that are mediated by medial prefrontal cortex and orbitofrontal cortex, such as behavioral flexibility, including outcome expectancy in goal directed behavior, and working memory. Our rationale for use of specific behavioral assessments aimed at prefrontal systems is grounded in research that 1) documents the critical role of prefrontal cortex (PFC) circuitry in the information encoding mechanisms required to support behavioral performance in these paradigms across rodent and primate species, 2) implicates PFC systems supporting these functions in SZ by anatomical and physiological/neuroimaging evidence from patients, 3) demonstrates a vulnerability of such PFC-mediated behaviors/networks to stress exposure, including underlying mechanisms in PFC. Importantly, the assessments hold potential for the study of species-conserved cognitive mechanisms in the human brain to provide translational opportunities based on this preclinical research program. As such, the work in Core C is consistent with the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approach for advancing a biological understanding of the pathophysiology of major psychiatric illness and creating a platform for discovery of new therapeutics. Core C will consult with the investigators of the Projects both for conducting basic behavioral assays, for implementing behavioral experiments with a focus on analytically powerful protocols targeting PFC-mediated behaviors, and will lead data analysis and interpretation of findings in behavioral studies under the research program. In addition to its scientific value to the immediate objectives of the research program, the work of this Core may have broader translational significance in the neuropsychiatric field. As the molecular pathways under investigation are better understood in the context of behavioral profiling, the work of the core could identify assessments that are best suited to target dysfunctional mechanisms in animal models of SZ. In this way the proposed behavioral research may yield innovative findings of more general preclinical importance."

Project Summary- Resource Core 1 The goals of the Biostatistics, Informatics, and Translational Resource Core (BITR) are to (1) foster the design of interventions that promote the restoration of and prevent loss of function in older adults, (2) promote the search for mechanisms underlying successful interventions, (3) translate interventions from the laboratory to the clinic and community, (4) design studies so as to maximize treatment fidelity and promote the measure- ment of treatment fidelity in all OAIC studies, and, (5) educate and help junior faculty plan and execute studies. RC-1 will provide an informatics backbone, GERI, that will support all aspects of the University of Maryland Older Americans Independence Center's (UM-OAIC) work. RC-1 will provide biostatistical expertise to UM- OAIC investigators helping ensure that studies are optimally designed and adequately powered, will randomize subjects and help analyze study data. RC-1 will make sure that best statistical practices guide the design and execution of OAIC research, the analysis of data, and the interpretation of the results of the analysis. By pro- moting treatment fidelity we will help assure that the test of our interventions are as efficient as possible and will increase the success of our efforts to translate interventions to the clinic and community. The Core will par- ticipate in Research Working Groups (RWG), which will assist with the design, execution, and oversight of all OAIC research. Research Working Groups, composed of the investigator, the investigator?s mentor if the in- vestigator is a junior faculty member, the study coordinator, one or more members from each resource core, and ad hoc experts, will use the reports produced by GERI as they oversee studies and monitor study pro- gress. The reports will help the RWGs assure that studies are completed in a timely fashion, and will help the RWGs identify studies that have potential for translation from laboratory bench to the clinic and community. GERI will collect and track requests for OAIC services (Request for Services system), will assist with the re- cruiting of subjects (Registry), will track study progress (Tracking Database), collect information describing ad- verse events (Adverse Event Database), and will facilitate quality control (Quality Control and Outlier Detection Systems). We will educate faculty, OAIC scholars (junior faculty) and staff in the principals of statistics and ep- idemiology and education efforts in collaboration with the REC."
"9513163","Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder in which preferential loss of motor neurons (MNs) results in paralysis and death. Although ALS is largely a sporadic disease, research has focused on heritable forms of the disorder because clinical and pathological evidence suggests common pathogenic mechanisms. Mutations in the gene FUS cause some of the most aggressive early-onset forms of ALS. In a recent study, our lab demonstrated in a mouse model of disease that mutant FUS causes motor neuron degeneration not by a loss-of-function, by a toxic gain-of-function that does not involve an excess of FUS activity. FUS is one of a number of RNA binding proteins ? including TDP-43 and hnRNP A1 ? that have been causally related to ALS. Our recent work ? together with related studies from several labs ? has led to a disease model in which the low complexity (LC) ?prion-like? domain of FUS and related proteins drives its phase transition to an irreversible, neurotoxic assembly. Our data demonstrates that ALS-related mutations in FUS increase the natural tendency of the protein to form these toxic assemblies, which trap and sequester other ribonucleoprotein granule components, including proteins involved in translational control. In this project we will explore the mechanisms of FUS toxicity in a series of transgenic and knock-in mutant mice with which we have modelled key aspect of the FUS-ALS phenotype. In addition, in vitro studies using motor neurons and astrocytes derived from these mouse models will be used to investigate cell autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms of disease.  In Aim 1, we will use a conditional knock-in mouse model to express mutant FUS in MNs or astrocytes, or more broadly in the nervous system to explore the effects of regulated mutant FUS expression on MN survival and function, and on gene expression changes that may underlie MN degeneration in FUS-ALS. We will also analyze mice with ALS-causing mutations in the LC domain of FUS to test the role of this critical domain in the disease. In Aim 2, we will use microfluidics to isolate MN axons and test the idea that FUS-dependent defects in axonal protein synthesis contribute to MN degeneration, and we will pursue our finding that hnRNP U selectively interacts with ALS-mutant FUS by exploring in vivo the functional role of this RNA binding protein in disease progression. Finally in Aim 3, we will apply a combination of single-cell RNA sequencing and topological data analysis to a mixed distribution of in vitro differentiated MNs derived from our FUS knock-in mutant mice. This sophisticated integration of in vivo and in vitro experimental systems, combined with our integrative computational and analytical approach will allow us to elucidate pathways of disease in vulnerable subpopulations of MNs and to identify potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of FUS-ALS and related forms of motor neuron disease."
"9387606","ABSTRACT For over 20 years, health care delivery in the U.S. has been informed by methodologies that create ?service areas?, such as Hospital Service Areas (HSAs) of the Dartmouth Atlas Project, to evaluate how health care resources are distributed across the population and how that impacts health outcomes. Policy makers have used these units to assess regional variation in health care utilization and quality to design strategies for improving health and health care systems. Delivery of cancer care in the United States represents a unique set of patients, technologies, clinical specialization, and patient- centered perspectives, distinct from other patient populations. The Institute of Medicine and the American Society of Clinical Oncology have recently noted that there is a ?crisis? in cancer care delivery, and highlighted the need for meaningful ways to assess quality. We propose to develop a novel method to generate Cancer Service Areas (CSAs) ? geospatial units analogous to HSAs, but specific to cancer care ? in order to create a framework for assessing regional cancer care delivery, quality, and outcomes. Based on health care utilization captured through all-payer claims and Medicare claims, we will extend and refine the Dartmouth HSA model. The derived CSAs have several key distinctions from existing service area delineations: a) focus on cancer-specific patient population/diagnoses; b) inclusion of outpatient claims, in addition to inpatient, to capture continuum of care; c) refinement of a complex network-based community detection method to account for spatial patterns of patient care while attaining geographic contiguity of the CSAs; and d) creation of an automated program in a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) environment that adapts to user-defined sets of services, diagnoses, or clinical phenotypes. Our specific aims are to: 1) Develop Cancer Service Areas (CSAs)- unique, cancer-specific geographic units of healthcare utilization to evaluate cancer care through a refined methodologic approach; 2) Evaluate the CSAs versus Dartmouth HSAs to assess their spatial specificity to the population of interest; and 3) Demonstrate the utility of CSAs as unique spatial units with respect to the cancer population. Creation of CSAs is an urgent need for policymakers (e.g. Congress), decision leaders (e.g. ASCO), health care systems, and ultimately patients who seek reliable, reportable information on quality cancer care. It is a first step towards these goals, and promises to serve broad service area methodologies at the same time."
"9537174","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a chronic, inflammatory disease of the lung that currently afflicts more than 300 million people worldwide. While asthma is mediated by an excessive Th2 immune response to allergens, recent evidence suggests that production of the Th17 cytokine, IL-17A, is associated with the development of more severe disease. While severe asthmatics are at greatest risk for morbidity or death following acute exacerbations, and can be refractory to therapies that are highly effective in individuals with mild disease, the molecular mechanisms whereby IL-17A contributes to the development of severe allergic asthma are ill-defined. A greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which IL-17A facilitates severe asthma would provide additional therapeutic targets for populations underserved by current therapies. Using a mouse model we provide evidence that severe asthma is associated with increased IL-17A production, and is compounded by enhanced Il17ra expression and elevated responsiveness to IL-17A. These alterations in IL-17A production and responsiveness exacerbate IL-13-driven STAT6 activation, gene expression, and airway responses. Our preliminary data suggests that IL-17A-mediated enhancement of IL-13-driven responses occur through two, non-mutually independent mechanisms in mouse cells; 1) by causing the dissociation of a complex including IL-13R?1 and TRAF3, which normally limits IL-13-driven STAT6 phosphorylation, and 2) by activating transcription factors (NF-?B, C/EBP? and C/EBP?) which can enhance IL-13/STAT6 driven gene expression. While preliminary studies presented here also suggest that similar mechanisms may operate in human cell lines, the extent to which the observations made in our mouse model apply to humans with severe asthma is unclear. Three specific aims are proposed to identify the molecular mechanisms through which IL-17A enhances asthma severity in mice, and humans. Specific Aim 1 will determine if the increased IL-13-driven STAT6 phosphorylation and AHR observed in the presence of IL-17A is the result of the dissociation of the IL- 13R?1:TRAF3 complex following initiation of IL-17A signaling. Specific Aim 2 will dissect the importance of IL- 17A-driven activation of NF-?B (canonical versus non-canonical), C/EBP? and C/EBP? in IL-13/IL-17A synergy in vitro and in vivo. Specific Aim 3 will directly test whether similar synergistic interactions between IL-13 and IL-17A are observed in asthma relevant, primary human cells. Additionally, we will determine whether severe asthma in children is associated, as it is in the mouse, with increased IL-17A production, IL17RA expression, and IL-17A responsiveness. Collectively, the studies proposed in this application will move us beyond the Th2 paradigm of allergic asthma, begin to characterize the mechanisms whereby Th17-products trigger the development of severe allergic asthma, and determine whether similar mechanisms may be at play in mice and humans. A better understanding of these mechanisms will enable us to identify novel targets for therapeutic interventions in individuals with severe asthma, a population underserved by current therapies."
"9397386","PROJECT SUMMARY  Especially for racial/ethnic minority youth, a college degree can offer a pathway towards better wellbeing across the lifespan. Although many biracial students experience positive adjustment in college and go on to earn a college degree, over 35% of biracial students who begin college fail to earn a degree within 6 years. The lack of a college degree can have significant economic costs, and failure to complete a college degree can initiate a cascade of mental and physical effects. Biracial students may encounter unique stressors in college, such as discrimination, difficulty finding a place to ?fit?, and forming and shifting their identity across contexts and time. Stress can impair emotional, social, and academic adjustment; when chronic, stress can also cumulatively affect physiology via a process commonly termed allostatic load, affecting long-term mental and physical health. Despite these risks, biracial students may have access to unique sources of resilience, promoting positive adjustment. However, we have little understanding of factors that promote resilience among biracial youth transitioning to college.  The proposed study will use a longitudinal approach to examine stress and resilience among biracial White/Hispanic college students. The project provides a chance to engage with this understudied population. Questionnaire and physiological data will be used to identify risk and resilient profiles of psychological, physiological, social, and cultural resources, which may promote or impair adjustment of biracial college students. The project will assess how these profiles affect stress, allostatic load, and trajectories of college adjustment over the first year of college. With the rapid growth of the biracial population in the U.S., filling gaps in research knowledge will help promote wellbeing among biracial individuals in college and into adulthood. An investigation of profiles of psychological, physiological, social, and cultural resilience resources is well-placed for translation into later preventative and intervention efforts with this understudied population.  "

"9260167","Parkinson?s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease with initial motor symptoms attributed to nigrostriatal dopamine depletion, but with increasing awareness of a non-motor symptom complex. Dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) is the most effective treatment for motor features, but fails to effectively treat non- motor features such as cognitive deficits. In fact, DRT can have a deleterious effect on attention and memory, suggesting that these early cognitive deficits may be unreliable markers for future cognitive progression. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in PD is common, and can progress at variable rates to dementia, but eventually results in disability and poor quality of life for most patients. Diffuse Lewy body disease is likely the primary pathological substrate for cognitive decline in PD, although reliable biomarkers predicting pathologic burden and risk of conversion to dementia have not been identified. The subgroup of PD patients experiencing visual hallucinations can develop dementia in 2.5 years, with evidence for associated posterior cortical atrophy and hypometabolism. However, since the incidence of visual hallucinations is low, additional sensitive regional markers of visuoperceptual dysfunction may potentially serve as cardinal signs of pathologic density and distribution. The long-term objective of this application is the study of the predictive validity of early cognitive deficits in PD, and identification of functional neuroimaging markers signaling more rapid conversion to dementia. Our hypothesis, based on models of pathologic staging, is that earlier involvement of posterior cortical regions and the dorsal and ventral visual pathways (with or without the presence of visual hallucinations) are reliable signals for cognitive progression. We will pursue the following specific aims: (1) To utilize a prospective longitudinal cohort to evaluate the prognostic value of PD-MCI subtypes in predicting risk for progression to dementia. Serial neuropsychological evaluations will be given across 4 years to mild PD patients to determine if visuoperceptual deficits predict cognitive progression. An exploratory genetic analysis of how SNCA (?-synuclein), MAPT (microtubule associated tau) and APOE (apolipoprotein E) might influence cognitive progression will be conducted. (2) To evaluate the utility of task-activated fMRI as a probe for cognitive progression by investigating altered posterior cortical networks prior to clinical manifestation. An event-related fMRI paradigm of object recognition memory will measure BOLD response in dorsolateral prefrontal, medial temporal and occipito-parieto-temporal regions in PD patients (with and without MCI) at baseline. (3) To determine the anatomical and regional brain activation patterns predictive of cognitive progression. Structural and functional MRI at baseline and annually for 4 years will characterize anatomical and neural network changes predictive of progression. Identification of biomarkers with sensitivity for early prediction and estimation of risk for conversion to dementia will pave the way for effective intervention with neuroprotective therapies during the critical stage when treatment has the greatest impact."
"9390653","Project Summary  This project will identify and address ethical and practical barriers to qualitative data sharing (QDS) in health sciences research. Qualitative research has unique value in understanding health behaviors and traits that are stigmatized and hidden such as risk factors for HIV or a genetic propensity to addiction. Accordingly, a lot of qualitative data are sensitive, and the data are provided within relationships of trust. NIH policy guidance states that ?all data should be considered for data sharing.? Sharing qualitative data offers cost-effective ways of providing important benefits to science, researchers, and students. However, qualitative research data are rarely shared and concerns exist regarding participant confidentiality, data ownership, and the time burden and cost of de-identifying data.  This project builds logically across three aims culminating in the systematic dissemination of a QDS Toolkit that includes stakeholder-informed guidelines for QDS and data anonymization support software and data curation processes that have been refined through a formative evaluation process with qualitative researchers.  1. We will engage diverse stakeholders to identify ethical and practical barriers to QDS. We will conduct in-  depth interviews and surveys with qualitative researchers, institutional review board members, data  curators, and former research participants to explore attitudes toward and recommendations for QDS.  2. We will conduct a qualitative data sharing trial. Thirty qualitative researchers will deposit data with a  partner data repository. To reduce the burden of QDS on researchers, we will develop qualitative data  anonymization support software, guidelines for QDS, and efficient data curation processes. Researchers  will provide feedback on all of these resources to guide revisions.  3. We will develop, evaluate, and disseminate a QDS Toolkit. QDS Toolkit content will be based on  literature reviewers, stakeholder input, and user feedback obtained during formative evaluation of the  toolkit. We expect it will contain ethical guidance provided through case studies, as well as all materials  developed through Aims 1 and 2. We will target four groups for dissemination: (a) data repositories; (b)  qualitative research journals; (c) qualitative textbook authors; and (d) research institutions. For each  group, we will identify current practices, provide access to the QDS Toolkit, recommend adoption of  specific practices, and track adoption.  This project will have a high impact on qualitative health research by increasing transparency and openness, promoting secondary data analysis, and facilitating research training, while demonstrating respect for participants, researchers, institutions, and regulations. The QDS Toolkit and all materials developed during this project will be made publicly available at no cost to users."
"9547042","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  The overall objective of Project 4 is to assess the relationship between exposure to pets, the infant home and gut microbiomes, and allergic asthma at 9 years of age, using an ethnically diverse, population-based general risk birth cohort (the WHEALS cohort). A premise with growing evidence is that lack of exposure to particular patterns of microbial stimuli during early infancy results in a heightened T-helper (Th) 2 response in the maturing immune system, likely due to a suboptimal regulatory capacity, which in turn is associated in childhood with increased immunoglobulin(lg)E, allergy, and clinical allergic conditions such as asthma. Epidemiological studies have revealed that atopic conditions have increased over the latter half of the twentieth century. Humans in earlier centuries had lifestyles associated with closer direct contact with soil, animals and other humans, suggesting exposure to environments with richer and more diverse microbiological burdens. We hypothesize that evolutionary adaptation to such microbial exposures with respect to immune recognition and regulation may result in untoward consequences when humans are presented with the different, and probably more limited, patterns of microbial exposures found in modern Westernized societies. Our theory is that in many settings, pets, as well as farm animals in close proximity, render the home microbiome, or bacterial community composition (BCC,) to be more similar to early 20th century environments with respect to an increased bacterial richness, diversity and a more even distribution of taxa. This home microbiome impacts directly through effects on the infant gastrointestinal tract BCC the immunogenesis of the infant and subsequently the development of clinically important outcomes such as childhood atopic asthma. Using a new technology (the G3 PhyloChipj, capable of cost-effectively identifying, to a great depth, bacteria in environmental and biological samples, our collaborative team has preliminary data suggesting that the presence of dogs and cats is associated with distinct home and infant gut microbiomes characterized by dramatic increases in bacterial diversity, richness and evenness. Using newly measured outcome variables measured by questionnaire and clinical examinations in the WHEALS cohort, in conjunction with PhyloChip analyses of stored infant stool and dust samples, we will test whether distinct patterns of pet exposure, home microbiome and infant gut microbiome are associated with current allergic asthma at age 9 years."

"9358697","The effects of drinking alcohol within recommended limits on risks of CVD, diabetes, and related diseases are perhaps the most important questions yet to be answered in the fields of alcohol, nutrition, or prevention. Approximately half of all adults worldwide report current or former alcohol consumption, and the benefits or risks that alcohol poses to their health urgently need clarification. Epidemiological studies have consistently found that alcohol intake within recommended limits is associated with lower risk of coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and diabetes, yet no long-term randomized trial of alcohol consumption on risk of any chronic disease has yet been performed. In direct response to PAR-16-363 (Multi-Site Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial Research Center on Alcohol's Health Effects), we propose a worldwide, six-year, balanced-design randomized trial, comparing the effects of one standard serving (~14 grams) of alcohol intake daily to abstention on risk of CVD, diabetes, mortality, and related outcomes among 7,800 adults at above-average cardiovascular risk worldwide. To maximize feasibility and reflect actual use most closely, we propose to test alcohol consumption per se to abstention and thus to offer participants flexibility in their choice of beverage, while employing novel and intensive yet efficient methods to monitor safety. The Primary Specific Aim of this trial is to determine the effects of 14 gm of alcohol intake daily compared with abstention on risk of major cardiovascular events or death (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hospitalized angina, need for revascularization, or death) over an average of 6 years of follow-up among 7,800 adults aged ?50 years with estimated 10-year CVD risk ?15% or prevalent CVD >6 months prior to enrollment. Secondary Aims will test the effects of alcohol on risks of incident diabetes and major cardiovascular events. Tertiary Aims will test risks of hard cardiovascular events and progression to impaired fasting glucose. Similar to other large randomized trials, we will establish ~16 centers worldwide using a stepped approach, with a 9-month vanguard phase among 7 centers in the US, Europe, Africa, and South America (in this application), followed by a second wave of additional sites to complete enrollment. Participants will be monitored for safety in multiple complementary ways, including brief electronic real-time reporting and validated yearly instruments and laboratory measures. We have brought together highly successful groups in the US and Europe to establish clinical, data, and biospecimen coordinating centers, our field centers include many of the most experienced clinical trialists anywhere, and our group has strong working relationships with NIAAA and other NIH staff necessary to ensure seamless collaboration during a U10-funded cooperative research endeavor. In this application, we propose the first randomized clinical trial of alcohol consumption, aiming to determine whether it increases or decreases the risk of CVD and diabetes among adults at above-average cardiovascular risk worldwide."
"9324802","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the Molecular and Cellular Cancer Biology Program (MCCBP), a basic research program, is to gain new insight into the molecular and cellular basis of cancer development and progression that can eventually be translated into the development of novel biomarkers of progression and treatment regimens. MCCBP research activities fall under three central themes: 1) genome stability; 2) signal transduction; and 3) mitochondria and metabolism. Specific aims of the MCCBP are to: 1) elucidate mechanisms of genome instability; 2) understand aberrant signal transduction in tumor cells; 3) investigate bioenergetic alterations and loss of apoptotic signaling in tumor cells; and 4) provide capacity building in support of the three research themes. Through collaboration and communication with other UPCI programs and translational disease-site groups, novel research findings by MCCBP investigators are translated into promising clinical applications, including the development of new targeted therapies and identification and validation of biomarkers. During the last funding cycle, the Program has lost 15 members but has added additional investigators and has grown by about 71% from 39 to 55 actively participating members, representing 17 departments and three schools at the University of Pittsburgh and one at Carnegie Mellon University. New members have been strategically added each year. Currently, MCCBP members receive over $9.8 M annually in direct funding, including $4.1 M from the NCI and $5.1 M in other peer-reviewed support. Between January 2010 and April 2014, MCCBP members have authored 771 cancer-related publications, of which 25% resulted from intra-programmatic and 38% from inter-programmatic collaborations. Approximately 42% of the papers represent collaborations with external investigators. The overall aim of the Program is to make fundamental discoveries in cancer biology in the key thematic areas. MCCBP leadership and members continue to achieve scientific impact through successful translation of pre-clinical research findings to clinical problems through strategic interactions with UPCI membership of other translational and clinical programs. UPCI support, including shared resources, specifically the Animal Facility, Biostatistics Facility, Cancer Bioinformatics Services, Cancer Genomics Facility, Cancer Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics Facility, Cancer Proteomics Facility, Cell and Tissue Imaging Facility, Chemical Biology Facility, Cytometry Facility, Immunological Monitoring and Cellular Products Laboratory, In Vivo Imaging Facility, and Tissue and Research Pathology Services facilitates and enhances MCCBP research."
"9386536","Project Summary Major theories of socioemotional development suggest that adaptive patterns of self-regulation reflect the accumulation of thousands of individual daily experiences of distress. In particular, parents? efforts to regulate their infants? distress are thought to provide critical inputs to developing self-regulation skills. Factors affecting caregiving, such as caregiver stress or mood disorders, are thought to limit parents? ability to provide this early support. Thus, early-emerging patterns of mother-infant interaction are theorized to be an important mechanism by which mental health risks are transmitted from caregivers to their children. However, empirical evidence for these theories are scarce, as it has not been possible to systematically capture episodes of distress as they occur in day-to-day mother and infant activity. Additionally, most studies cannot disentangle complex interactions between infant and maternal psychobiological factors. For example, highly fussy infants are more likely to stress and overwhelm their parents, thereby likely affecting parental regulation efforts and potentially exacerbating their own early biological predispositions. Datasets capturing the details of daily interactions between mothers and their infants are needed to access the basic bio-behavioral mechanisms of developing psychopathology risk. In the future, such rich datasets could also provide a foundation for emerging ?just in time? interventions that could provide mothers with real-time support and reassurance during day-to-day activities. To thus advance the field of developmental psychopathology, this proposal will leverage emerging ?wearable? or mobile-sensor technologies to capture episodes of infant distress and subsequent maternal regulation efforts as they occur in the typical day-to-day activities of infants and their mothers. The research aims of this proposal are 1) to develop a mobile-sensing platform that will automatically detect detailed markers of mother-infant distress-related activity as participants go about their daily lives, captured via a synchronized suite of ?wearable? physiology, audio and proximity sensors, and once validated, to use this platform to 2) investigate the daily mechanisms of maladaptive mother-infant interaction dynamics The training goals of this proposal are to 1) develop my expertise with state-of-the art computational tools to study mother-infant activity in the ?wild?, allowing me unprecedented access to the dynamic processes of bio- behavioral development, and 2) to provide me the opportunity bridge my work to the domain of developmental psychopathology. The proposed K01 is thus a key step in my goal to develop a research program that can harness the rich dynamics of day-to-day activity to support theoretically-driven clinical innovations."
"9369156","PROJECT SUMMARY  Schizophrenia (SZ) is a severe psychiatric disorder that results in significant disability. All currently approved antipsychotic medications work by primarily blocking D2-type dopamine receptors. Many patients are partially or completely unresponsive to them, and suffer significant side effects. Developing new SZ treatments is a critical need. However, we lack a clear understanding of disease progression mechanisms and have no specific targets for effective treatment and early intervention. Recently several lines of evidence suggest that brain oxidative stress and disturbances in neuroinflammatory system play key roles in SZ. And several antioxidants and anti-inflammatory medications have been tested in some small clinical trials as a supplemental to antipsychotics. However, to date, clinical trials have produced mixed results. The effect of these interventions may greatly depend on the integrity of the a ntioxidant glutathione ( GSH) system and the intrinsic redox status. It is well known that intensive energy demand of brain cells leads to accumulation of toxic reactive oxygen species such as H2O2 and free radicals O2* (i.e. oxidative stress). These are eliminated by GSH, a critical molecule in resisting oxidative stress. These chemical processes also are strongly mediated by the redox state of NAD+/NADH. Dysregulations of the redox state may affect anti-oxidative defense, anti- inflammation and energy homestasis as well as exert downstream effects on synaptic function and plasticity in the brain. Therefore, methods to monitor GSH level and redox state are critically needed.  Despite the essential role of redox balance in the human brain, few methods are available to access it in vivo. Most data reported to date have been collected from cell-cultures or postmortem studies. There is a large gap in our knowledge to show how the phenomena observed ex vivo relate to brain function in vivo. The current study aims to develop an in vivo biomarker reflecting oxidative stress in SZ patients. In this proposal, we will utilize in vivo 1H- and 31P-MRS to 1) directly quantify both antioxidant level-GSH and redox state (NAD+/NADH) in 1st episode SZ patients, and healthy controls and 2) validate whether reduced antioxidant GSH level is associated with the reduced redox state in SZ. We will also explore the relationships between clinic measures (negative/positive symptoms and cognitive performance) and experimental measures (redox balance and antioxidant levels indicated by NADH/NAD+ and GSH, respectively). Redox dysregulation would be the upstream molecular mechanism of GSH depletion, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in SZ. The results would provide new insights into the central ?immuno-oxidative? pathway of SZ, a promising therapeutic target. To the best of our knowledge, the current proposal is the first to measure redox state and antioxidant GSH in vivo and link them to the pathophysiology of SZ. The insights obtained from redox state and associated antioxidant GSH levels may help to develop strategies to promote neuronal survival and protection in brain pathologies."
"9433923","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The fundamental mission of academic medicine is the acquisition and application of scientific knowledge to improve health care. In order for the medical enterprise to function effectively, it is critically important for the academic biomedical community to have physician-scientists who receive special training that integrates both a rigorous scientific education with state-of-the-art medical education. These individuals facilitate interactions between the clinic and lab that promote both basic investigation on disease mechanisms and translational research leading to clinical applications. Thus, they are positioned to be leaders in biomedical research and educational communities. The Ohio State University (OSU) Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) was initially funded to achieve these lofty goals in 2011. In this renewal application, we describe the outstanding MD-PhD training program we have developed, which provides rigor, depth, and breadth of both scientific and medical education in a way that facilitates the integration of both sets of training to prepare these dedicated and driven students for careers as successful physician-scientists. Over the preceding grant period, the OSU MSTP has served as a partnership program linking medical school curriculum with three integrated core graduate programs during a time of tremendous curricular evolution. By working closely with medical school and graduate school leadership, we have used new approaches in both areas to develop a cutting-edge curriculum joining foundational knowledge with in-depth scientific inquiry in a wide variety of areas. Medical school coursework is completed using an MSTP-specific modification of OSU's Lead. Serve. Inspire (LSI) curriculum, a competency-based, efficient approach which eschews large lectures in favor of self-directed learning, high-yield student-faculty contact hours, and early, meaningful, patient contact. PhD courses begin in the second year of the program. The prior grant allowed students to earn their degrees in the Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program (BGSP), Neuroscience Graduate Studies Program (NGSP), or Biomedical Engineering (BME). In this proposal, we make good on our plan to expand PhD availability across the University to carefully vetted affiliate programs, leveraging our campus strength in non-traditional, but highly relevant graduate programs. Because of our curricular integration and careful oversight by MSTP Leadership, students complete their studies in a time-efficient manner, typically 8 years. Our innovative MD-PhD program has attracted interest from an outstanding pool of applicants that has doubled in size over the past 5 years concurrent with a doubling in size of our matriculating class from 5 to 10 students per year. Herein we request funds to double our NIH-supported training slots in graded fashion to match this growth.     Renewal: students, developing future leaders who will enable the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center to achieve its stated mission: To improve people's lives through innovation in research, education and patient care."
"9535680","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sepsis associated with acute lung injury (ALI) is a common cause of death in hospitalized patients. ALI is in large part the result of lung vascular leakage and protein rich edema and there is a lack of effective therapy. Here, we have proposed a novel strategy to reverse ALI by stimulating an endogenous recovery process that is usually activated after lung injury. Thrombin, an edema-genic factor generated during sepsis, mediates pulmonary vascular leakage by activating protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) on the endothelial cell surface. PAR-1-induced Ca2+ entry via store-operated Ca2+-entry channels (SOCs), disassembles endothelial adherens junctions (AJs) to cause increased lung vascular leak. An endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localized Ca2+ sensor protein stromal interacting molecule-1 (STIM1), is crucial for activating SOC to induce store- operated Ca2+-entry (SOCE) in endothelial cells (ECs). Now, we have identified in a murine model of tamoxifen-inducible endothelial cell (EC)-restricted TAK1 (Map3k7) deletion (Map3k7i?EC), a key role for TAK1 in resolving PAR-1-mediated pulmonary edema formation through regulation of the functions of STIM1, glycogen synthase kinase-3? (GSK-3?) and ?-catenin in ECs. We made the following observations (Supporting Data): i) TAK1 null ECs exhibited augmented SOCE and permeability in response to PAR-1 activation; ii) PAR-1-induced lung vascular permeability in vivo was not reversible in Map3k7i?EC mice; iii) ?- catenin expression was markedly reduced in ECs of Map3k7i?EC mice; iv) glycogen synthase kinase-3? (GSK- 3?) was persistently active in ECs of Map3k7i?EC mice, which may account for the markedly reduced expression of ?-catenin in ECs of Map3k7i?EC mice; v) PAR-1-medatied TAK1 activation was prevented in ECs of EC-restricted STIM1 knockout (Stim1?EC) mice; vi) surprisingly, we observed that SOCE signals the inactivation of GSK-3? via TAK1 activation in ECs; vii) importantly, PAR-1-mediated lung vascular leak was markedly reduced in tamoxifen-inducible EC-restricted GSK-3? knockout (GSK-3?i?EC) mice. Based on these novel observations, in Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that TAK1 activation secondary to STIM1-mediated SOCE induces STIM1 phosphorylation which in turn inhibits SOCE and dampens lung vascular permeability. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that TAK1 activation secondary to STIM1-mediated SOCE phosphorylates GSK-3? to inactivate GSK-3?, which in turn promotes increased ?-catenin expression at endothelial AJs to restore endothelial barrier integrity and thereby resolves pulmonary edema. A better understanding of the signaling mechanisms of TAK1 functions downstream of SOCE will lead to novel therapeutic approaches that will resolve pulmonary edema in sepsis."

The primary goal of this program is to develop the future academic and scientific leaders of gastroenterology by training promising clinically trained (MD, MD/PhD, DVM, DVM/PhD) and PhD postdoctoral fellows to become independent laboratory-based investigators. A diverse, extensive and integrated training program helps our trainees develop new insights into the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal diseases and perform basic and translational research to identify novel diagnostic and treatment approaches. We propose to continue supporting four postdoctoral fellows for 2 years of full time lab-based research. We recruit clinically trained research gastroenterology fellows and PhD postdoctoral fellows, with an equal distribution of clinically trained and PhD trainees. We have a comprehensive, interactive training program that integrates trainees of different backgrounds to broaden the educational experience of all participants. The effectiveness of this integrated training program is proven by results: 16 of our 18 postdoctoral trainees who have completed their T32 mentored training over the past 10 years have obtained academic positions or are currently continuing their training and both of our medical students (supplemental awards) continue their clinical training. We have filled our full complement of trainees for each year of funding with exceptionally well qualified trainees who were actively engaged in basic GI research under highly qualified mentors. Under the stable leadership of Drs. Sartor and Henning, our T32 training program has undergone continued evolution since the last competitive renewal in 2011 that has improved our ability to prepare trainees for independent research careers. We have created a cohesive program with monthly interactions among the T32 trainees and the Executive Committee, a formal research committee for all trainees, written annual progress reviews for each trainee and established an Advisory Committee for external oversight and guidance, including improved recruitment of minority background trainees. Finally, we have appointed extremely talented trainees and maintained an equal balance between clinical and PhD trainees over the past funding cycle. One graduated MD trainee from an underrepresented racial group from the current cycle is now an Assistant Professor at another institution."

"9382249","Project Summary Nearly half of mechanically ventilated (MV), critically ill adults develop ventilator-induced respiratory muscle weakness (particularly of the diaphragm), which impairs successful weaning from MV, often leads to re- intubation, and is associated with higher post-ICU mortality. We have recently shown that respiratory muscle weakness is associated with extubation failure in critically ill children, but we still lack crucial information on the mechanisms and timing of this weakness, its importance for ventilator weaning, and its potential prevention through promoting more physiologic levels of patient effort of breathing during MV. Diaphragm weakness is most common in patients exposed to high levels of controlled ventilation. In children, we have shown that usual care ventilator management is frequently associated with minimal patient effort of breathing. To enhance patient effort, we developed a novel computer-based approach (Real-time Effort Driven ventilator management (REDvent)), which offers systematic recommendations to reduce controlled ventilation during the acute phase of MV, and uses real-time measures to adjust supported ventilator pressures such that patient effort of breathing remains in a normal range during the ventilator weaning phase. Through a Phase I clinical trial, we demonstrated that patients managed with REDvent spent fewer days on MV than historical controls, and bedside providers could easily implement REDvent. Our central hypothesis is that REDvent use will reduce ventilator-induced respiratory muscle weakness, leading to shorter time on MV by enhancing the patient?s capacity for effective, unsupported ventilation and by facilitating MV weaning. This application proposes a Phase II controlled clinical trial that will obtain comprehensive, serial assessments of respiratory muscle strength and architecture to understand the evolution of ventilator-induced respiratory muscle weakness in critically ill children, and test whether REDvent can preserve respiratory muscle strength and reduce time on MV. Three integrated yet independent Specific Aims are proposed: SA 1 will determine the clinical impact of REDvent by examining whether REDvent use for either acute or weaning phase ventilator management results in shorter MV weaning times compared to usual care; SA 2 will use a sophisticated, multi-modal approach to obtain a comprehensive view of respiratory muscle capacity, effort, load, and architecture to quantify the importance of respiratory muscle weakness on weaning outcomes in children, and identify when this weakness develops; SA 3 seeks to determine the independent effect of patient effort of breathing on the development of respiratory muscle weakness, after controlling for known or suspected risk factors for respiratory muscle weakness. Upon completion, this study will provide important information on the pathogenesis and timing of respiratory muscle weakness during MV in children, whether this weakness can be mitigated by promoting more normal patient effort during MV via the use of REDvent; forming the basis for a larger, Phase III multi-center study, powered for key clinical outcomes such as 28-day Ventilator Free Days."
"9317540","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competing renewal application to continue our preclinical research on expression, neurobiology and treatment of pain-related behavioral depression. Pain is a significant clinical challenge that is often associated with clinically relevnt depression of behavior and mood. Moreover, relief of pain-related depression is a common goal of treatment in both human and veterinary medicine. Our research is founded on the proposition that research on pain-related depression could provide new basic-science insights on mechanisms that mediate affective dimensions of pain and new strategies for pain treatment. Our data so far suggest a role for dysregulated mesocorticolimbic dopamine (DA) signaling in nucleus accumbens (NAc) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) as a mediator of pain-depressed behavior, and studies proposed in this application would pursue hypotheses related to this mechanism. Specifically, during the current project period, we developed and validated a new behavioral assay of acute and chronic pain-depressed behavior in rats. We then used this procedure to achieve the following research goals: (1) evaluation of >40 drugs from multiple drug classes to confirm that our procedure is both sensitive to known analgesics and selective for analgesics vs. non- analgesics; (2) correlation of pain-related depression of behavior and pain-related depression of DA release in NAc; and (3) discovery that pain states also increase PFC expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a protein implicated in depression consequent to non-pain stressors. In this competing renewal application, we propose to extend on this work in a series of three specific aims. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that DA agonists wil compensate for pain effects and produce analgesia in behavioral assays of pain- depressed behavior. We propose to evaluate analgesic effects of D1, D2 and D3 DA receptor agonists in assays of acute and chronic pain-depressed behavior. Our hypothesis predicts that agonists at one or more DA receptor subtype will be effective. Effects of indirect DA agonists will also be examined for comparison. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that pain states modulate downstream mediators of DA signaling in NAc and PFC. We propose to assess pain effects on PFC DA release to complement our microdialysis studies in NAc. In addition, we propose to test consequences of pain-altered DA release by evaluating (a) density of the DA transporter and of D1, D2 and D3 receptors, and (b) expression of two complementary and physiologically relevant indicators of DA tone ( FosB and phosphorylation of protein kinase B). We predict compensatory changes in response to pain-related decreases in DA. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that pain states will also modulate signaling mediated by BDNF in NAc and PFC. Increased expression of BDNF within the mesocorticolimbic system has been implicated in the development of depressive behavior. We predict that pain states will augment BDNF signaling, and that direct overexpression or knockdown of BDNF signaling within this system with viral vectors will modulate expression of pain-depressed behavior."
"9317312","PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic alcohol abuse is associated with many physiological disturbances, such as sleep disruptions that may aggravate alcohol?s negative effects and potentiate alcohol dependence. Our preliminary results, using a novel chronic alcohol binge-drinking paradigm with concurrent sleep assessments, revealed that sleep/wake fragmentation increases within 2 weeks of alcohol binge exposure in mice. Recently, cortical neural nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) neurons have been identified as key players in the regulation of sleep/wake. Interestingly, nNOS neurons are also expressed in the nucleus accumbens and preliminary results reveal the importance of these neurons in driving sleep homeostasis as well, with nNOS neurons being sleep-active. Interestingly, nNOS is also a molecular target of high interest in the addiction field. Administration of nNOS inhibitors decreases alcohol consumption and blocks alcohol withdrawal, and blocking nNOS expression centrally decreases alcohol intake in rats. nNOS null mutant mice (nNOS-/-) have shown to consume more alcohol than their wild-type counterparts in a free-choice paradigm, while having decreased sensitivity to reinforcing effects of alcohol. Interestingly, chronic alcohol consumption leads to differential effects on nNOS activity across brain regions: nNOS protein levels are reduced in the frontal-parietal cortex, but are elevated within the NAc. Altogether these data lead us hypothesize that alcohol-induced nNOS activity within the NAc may disrupt sleep homeostasis regulation, and thereby mediate alcohol abuse comorbid sleep disturbances. In order to test this hypothesis, we propose to determine whether binge alcohol consumption alters the relationship between sleep/wake state and accumbal vs. cortical nNOS neuronal activity. We will thus assess electroencephalographic (EEG) activity and determine c-FOS expression in nNOS neurons within the Nac and PFC of male and female C57BL/6J mice following acute administration of an intoxicating dose of alcohol, and following 2 weeks of repeated binge drinking. Second, we will assess whether accumbal nNOS neuron ablation decreases alcohol binge drinking and associated sleep fragmentation. We will test the effects of local chemogenetic ablation of nNOS neurons within the NAc on alcohol intake during binge drinking, using micro-injection of a Cre-dependent virus within the NAc of nNOS-CreER mutant mice. Knowledge gained from this exploratory grant will be used as the basis for a larger R01 grant proposal with the ultimate goal of furthering our understanding of neurobiological mechanisms and circuitry of alcohol abuse and comorbid sleep disorders, and to develop novel therapeutics to prevent drug addiction."
"9336394","Project Summary The primary goal of this proposal is to develop, implement, and evaluate an online module to improve obstetric providers' knowledge, skills and practices regarding perinatal depression. There is a tremendous public health need for addressing this problem as upwards of 1 in 5 women suffer from perinatal depression. Left untreated, it has deleterious effects on maternal and birth outcomes, infant attachment, and children's behavior/development. Maternal suicide causes 20% of postpartum deaths in depressed women. Although the vast majority of perinatal women are amenable to being screened for depression, screening alone does not improve treatment rates or patient outcomes. While the majority of obstetric providers report wanting to address depression, fear of liability, discomfort, and lack of knowledge and resources present barriers. Addressing these barriers requires a practical and sustainable approach. To meet this need, our team developed the Massachusetts Child Psychiatry Access Project (MCPAP) for Moms. MCPAP for Moms provides training for obstetric providers on how to detect, assess and treat perinatal depression. Our training has been identified as a model for other states; stakeholders from 15 different states across the country have contacted our team and requested our training materials. However, our training was developed specific to the Massachusetts environment and available mental health resources and is currently delivered in person. To fill training gaps in other states and make training more broadly accessible, we propose to develop a state-of-the- art, training module, The Basics of Addressing Perinatal Depression, which will be delivered online and take into account the different mental health resources available in other states across the US. The module will support obstetric providers to: 1) implement depression screening; 2) assess depression and comorbidities; 3) triage and refer complicated cases to psychiatric providers; 4) treat women with less complicated illness; and 5) consider risks and benefits of different treatment modalities. We will conduct a formative evaluation of this module via in depth interviews with 10 obstetric providers and revise/refine based on iterative feedback. We will then conduct a summative evaluation by implementing the module with a different 10 obstetric providers by a) obtaining data on provider knowledge acquisition and satisfaction (pre/post-test comparison) and change in knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward depression screening among providers, and b) providers perception of change in mental health treatment initiation among women (pre/post-test survey). If shown to be effective, our training will help obstetric providers implement depression screening and develop the processes they need to respond appropriately when women are depressed, thus getting women the care they need. Our combined expertise in the integration of obstetric and depression care, adult learning, perinatal psychiatry and Ob/Gyn along with our established relationships with stakeholders make us ideally suited to implement, evaluate and disseminate our training. If proven effective, our training will be poised for national dissemination.  "

"9398503","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The impact of disease beliefs on self-management of chronic illness such as diabetes (DM) in the setting of cancer is largely unknown. In addition, little is known about the impact of age- or cancer-related cognitive changes on cancer survivors? self-management behaviors (SMB) for their other comorbidities. Without this knowledge, our ability to provide optimal self-management support for cancer survivors with comorbidities is limited. The goal of this study is to determine how disease beliefs about cancer and DM and cognitive changes affect older breast cancer survivors? DM SMB. We will focus on older breast cancer survivors with early-stage cancer who have received chemotherapy or hormonal therapy (HT) since these patients are more likely to have age- or cancer-related cognitive changes and are more likely to die from complications from their comorbidities as from their breast cancer. We will focus on DM due to its high prevalence in cancer survivors, association with worse cancer outcomes and cognitive decline, impact on competing risks of death, and its moderate SMB complexity. The study design is rooted in the Common Sense Self-Regulation Model (CSM), a theory of health behaviors that has been used to develop interventions, but has primarily been applied to research on behaviors around single diseases. By understanding the relationship between disease beliefs about breast cancer and DM and the interrelationship of disease beliefs and cognitive function on survivors? DM SMB, we will advance both the CSM and care of older breast cancer survivors with comorbidities. The Specific Aims are to: 1) Evaluate the longitudinal interrelationship of beliefs about breast cancer and DM and its effect on survivors? DM SMB (adherence to medications, diet and exercise); 2) Assess the effect of cognitive function on DM SMB and evaluate whether disease beliefs mediate, in part, an association between cognition and DM SMB; and 3) Develop and pilot an educational and counseling intervention to improve DM SMB among breast cancer survivors with comorbid DM. This prospective cohort study will recruit 320 older (?55 years) breast cancer survivors with pre-existing DM who have completed first-line chemotherapy or are taking hormonal therapy for treatment of early stage (I-IIIA) breast cancer within the past 5 years. We will first conduct qualitative interviews with 20 survivors to identify DM and cancer health beliefs and to elicit specific strategies and routines used to manage DM. We will then recruit 300 participants and interview them every 6 months for 24 months to assess longitudinal changes in cancer and DM beliefs and in cognition to evaluate their impact on DM SMB. For the subgroup of women currently taking HT, we will also assess the impact of beliefs and cognitive function on HT adherence. We will integrate the information collected in the quantitative and qualitative interviews to create educational and counseling modules and pilot test their impact on SMB on a group of 100 breast cancer survivors with DM. The proposed study addresses the need to develop strategies to optimize SMB for chronic comorbidities in cancer survivors using breast cancer and DM as the paradigm."
"9379750","Project Summary Functional understanding of the genetic circuits underlying complex phenotypes, including disease, will require robust, scalable tools for modulating and tracking transcriptional events. Currently, RNAi using shRNAs is the only high-throughput approach available, and this is largely limited to transcript knockdown. This project aims to develop a suite of broadly applicable tools for the interrogation of RNA based on CRISPR-Cas enzymes that target RNA in a programmable manner. Tools for transcript knockdown, translation upregulation, and transcript sensing will be developed, which, together, will enable dissection of genetic circuits in a dynamic, high-throughput manner, accelerating nearly all areas of biomedical science. The proposal is focused on four key goals: 1. Functionally and biochemically characterize RNA-targeting Cas enzymes, and then harness these  enzymes for transcript editing in eukaryotic cells. Novel RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas enzymes will be  developed as platforms for transcript knockdown and translational upregulation. The availability of  programmable tools for transcriptome editing in mammalian cells will provide new avenues for analyzing  the effect of gene expression events and will greatly advance our ability to study specific mRNA isoforms,  which is particularly important for understanding the brain. 2. Improve RNA knockdown screens. The current state-of-the-art for forward genetic screens in  mammalian systems uses shRNAs, but these have significant off-target effects. RNAi screens based on  programmable RNA-targeting enzymes will afford more robust, reliable data, boosting forward genetic approaches. 3. Create programmable reporter systems for transcript sensing. Catalytically inactive RNA-targeting  Cas enzymes will be engineered to serve as programmable RNA-binding scaffolds that can be fused to  various functional moieties (e.g., fluorophores) to develop transcript sensors. These sensors will enable  dynamic, efficient tracking of transcriptional changes over extended periods of time and provide a means  for isolating transcriptionally defined cell populations for further study. 4. Develop genome-wide screens to dissect genetic regulatory circuits. Genome-wide Cas9 knockout  and activation screening will be combined with RNA-targeting sensors to develop high-throughput systems  to identify genomic regions (coding and non-coding) that influence the expression of a target gene. These tools, which will be openly shared, will be broadly applicable across species and systems and will serve as a general framework for the expansion of the RNA-targeting toolbox. They will radically transform existing approaches for studying gene expression dynamics and exploring the significance of isoforms and non-coding transcripts."

"9307281","In 2020 there will be an estimated $280B in public and private expenditures for behavioral healthcare (substance misuse and mental/developmental disorders). Consequently there has been increasing attention to the problem of integrating evidence-based programs into day-to-day regular practice in community behavioral healthcare practice. One important organizational mechanism for disseminating evidence-based programs and practices in healthcare generally and behavioral healthcare in particular are ?evidence-based program registers? (EBPRs) on the internet, such as: the National Register of Promising Programs and Practices (NREPP), Effective Interventions: HIV Prevention that Works, and Blueprints for Health Youth Development. The proposed study builds on the applicant?s recent R21 study that identified 20 EBPR organizations relevant to behavioral healthcare, described the characteristics of these registers, analyzed the similarities and differences in the registers? evidentiary criteria of effectiveness, and determined to what extent the ratings of individual behavioral healthcare programs were discrepant.  The overall goal of this follow-on research is to determine to what extent the major EBPRs as innovative organizations actually increase the implementation of evidence-based programs and practices in the real world of behavioral healthcare organizations and to develop recommendations for improving the visibility, accessibility and utilization of these registers. The specific aims of this mixed-methods study are:  1. Study the visitors to evidence-based program register websites to determine: characteristics of the users; reasons for accessing the registers; information obtained; information sought but not found; perceived usefulness of the registers; intended utilization of the information obtained; uses to which the information was actually put at the time of a six-month follow-up (such as adopting evidence-based programs or improving existing programs); and recommendations for improving the registers? accessibility and utility.  2. Study the mandates for implementing evidence-based programs issued by federal and state funding organizations in behavioral healthcare, with special attention to mandates to use specific EBPRs. This will measure the impact of the registers on behavioral healthcare programming and funding decisions by major governmental organizations nationally.  3. Study key stakeholders of the registers (i.e., program/policy developers in state and private sector provider organizations) to determine the extent of awareness of the registers, the degree to which various registers have been accessed; the reasons they have been used; the uses to which the information has been put (e.g., adoption of EBPs; new policies concerning EBPs); the perceived utility of the registers; and recommendations for improving the registers? accessibility and utilization. This would be accomplished through national telephone surveys of purposive samples of stakeholders in three major content areas of behavioral healthcare: substance misuse (drugs/alcohol), mental health and child welfare."
"9355671","ABSTRACT Phenotyping animal models of disease is a critical element in our Center's goal to understand, effectively treat, and when possible, prevent intellectual and developmental disabilities in children. Accordingly, the mission of the Animal Phenotyping Core (Core E, AP) is to assist investigators seeking to discover behavioral, physiological, structural and metabolic phenotypes in diverse rodent models of intellectual and developmental disabilities. The AP Core performs studies primarily in mice and rats to identify the functional alterations resulting from genetic, developmental or environmental manipulations that may impair neural and behavioral development. These include changes in developmental milestones, sensorimotor function, cognitive function, affective and social behaviors, feeding and activity patterns, body composition and/or energy expenditure, patterns of brain activity as assessed by EEG and brain imaging in MRI/DTI (diffusion tensor imaging) and PET scans. The AP Core accomplishes its goals through SubCores focused on (1) metabolism, (2) behavior, (3) brain imaging and (4) electroencephalography. By combining existing capabilities and highly experienced faculty we have established an animal phenotyping facility uniquely suited to plan, perform and evaluate coordinated behavioral, metabolic, and functional neuroimaging and electrophysiological assessments in developing and adult rodents. Through close collaborative efforts with the Neural Cell Engineering and Imaging (NCEI) Core and the Human Clinical Phenotyping (HCP) Core, as well as the Neurogenomics (NGEN) Core, the consequences of defined genetic, environmental and/or physiological alterations are thoroughly characterized to determine their impact in the context of measures most relevant and translatable to the human disease phenotype. The AP Core also makes critical contributions to Aim 2 of the IDDRC Research Project focused on the origins of ID in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. In addition to the wide range of expertise of its leadership and the resources they bring to this effort, the AP Core also emphasizes the importance of integration across measurement and analytical capabilities, i.e., it facilitates a combination of methodological approaches such as pursuit of brain imaging simultaneously with behavioral studies. We also emphasize phenotyping techniques that mesh well with the types of studies conducted in children with IDD. In pursuit of these scientific objectives, the AP Core leadership, in concert with ADM Core oversight, also carefully monitors IDDRC investigator Core access and user satisfaction, cost effectiveness and quality control."
"9543620","Abstract. Their central importance to the synthetic, secretory and metabolic functions of the liver renders hepatocytes particularly vulnerable to injury. Reinforcing hepatocyte resilience to damaging insults holds potential to block liver disease progression at early stages, independent of etiology. To that end, ecto-5?-nucleotidase (CD73) is a promising novel liver disease target, as it plays critical roles in multiple mouse liver injury models, and is dysregulated in livers of patients with chronic liver diseases of multiple etiologies. The classical function of CD73 is metabolism of extracellular adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to adenosine. We found that global CD73-/- mice are resistant to chemically-induced hepatocellular injury, an unexpected finding given that liver injury induces near-complete loss of cell surface CD73 AMPase activity in wild-type mice. This points to alternative functions, which is also supported by our identification of a novel, catalytically-inactive CD73 isoform (CD73S) in advanced human liver disease. We observe differences in apoptosis-related signaling in primary hepatocytes expressing the two different human CD73 isoforms. CD73 binds two bioactive lipids in vitro, suggesting that it may regulate lipid homeostasis. Our central hypothesis is that non-enzymatic and alternative isoform-related mechanisms of hepatocyte CD73 promote liver injury and disease progression. The hypothesis will be addressed via two specific aims: (i) Define the non-enzymatic and isoform-specific functions of CD73 in hepatocytes and (ii) Examine the in vivo and tissue-level mechanisms of hepatoprotection in the absence of CD73. Our approach for Aim 1 will couple high throughput ligand screening, high content imaging, and proteomics with detailed biochemical, molecular and cell-biological assessments to determine if CD73 is a lipid-sensing receptor or a regulator of ER stress, and to determine the specific function of the non-catalytic CD73S variant in hepatocyte resistance to stress. For Aim 2, we will examine liver-specific contributions of CD73 in vivo using two models of alcohol and high fat diet-induced injury and our newly-generated liver-specific CD73-/- mice. We will utilize recombinant enzyme in vivo and precision-cut liver slices to perform mechanistic rescue and loss-of-function studies. This work will lead to a thorough integration of CD73 function in hepatocytes with the potential to yield novel mechanistic approaches for hepatoprotection."
"9383995","Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1? is a transcription factor that has been shown to be up-regulated in almost all types of chronic kidney diseases (CKD). HIF-1? stimulates the collagen accumulation by activating fibrogenic factors. There is evidence suggesting that the long-term activation of HIF-1? is injurious in CKD, although upregulation of HIF-1? is protective in acute kidney injury. The coexistent hypertension plays a predominant role in the progression of CKD. Despite the findings that impaired renal autoregulation transmits the elevated renal perfusion pressure (RPP) into the renal microvasculature, causing RPP-induced renal injury in CKD, little is known regarding the molecular mechanism mediating RPP-induced injury. Our preliminary data showed that silencing of HIF-1? attenuated renal injury without effect on hypertension in a rat 5/6 renal ablation/infarction model (5/6 A/I); maintaining a normal RPP blocked the increase of renal HIF-1? and suppressed the renal injury in this CKD model, indicating that HIF-1? may mediate RPP-induced renal injury. HIF prolyl- hydroxylases (prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing proteins, PHDs) are the major enzymes to promote the degradation of HIF-1? and present in the kidneys to regulate renal HIF-1?. We recently showed that PHDs play a critical role in TGF-?- and ANG II-induced activation of HIF-1? and consequent injuries in renal cells. Our preliminary data showed that renal PHD activity was inhibited by elevated RPP and that activating PHD activity attenuated renal injury in 5/6 A/I rats. Thus, PHD-mediated regulation of HIF-1? could be an important mechanism mediating RPP-induced injury. Further, the PHD activity is inhibited by the activation of TRPC6, a member of the Transient Receptor Potential Channels. The activation of TRPC6 is known to produce renal injury. Moreover, TRPC6 participates in the mechanical/pressure sensation in various cell types, including podocytes. Therefore, TRPC6 may be the upstream mediator that transmits the RPP stress into downstream molecular pathways to cause RPP-induced injury. Our preliminary data showed that the levels of renal TRPC6 was increased, which was inhibited by servo-control to block the increase of RPP in rats with 5/6 A/I. In addition, TRPC6 shRNA blocked the increase of HIF-1? in the kidneys of 5/6 A/I rats. The above information leads to a hypothesis that the elevated RPP activates TRPC6, which inhibits PHD activity to induce HIF-1?- mediated profibrogenic genes, consequently causing renal injuries in CKD. Three specific aims are proposed. Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that over-activation of HIF-1? mediates RPP-induced chronic renal injury in CKD. Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that elevated RPP inhibits PHD activity to up-regulate HIF-1?, thereby producing chronic renal injury in CKD. Aim 3: To test the hypothesis that TRPC6 is the upstream regulator sensing pressure stress to regulate PHD/HIF-1? pathway in RPP-induced renal injury in CKD. The results from these proposed studies will define an important molecular mechanism associated with TRPC6/PHD/HIF-1? pathway in RPP-induced injury in CKD, which will ultimately suggest new therapeutic targets for CKD."
"9454606","Rickettsial tick-borne pathogens exhibit a wide range of prevalence in their tick vectors, yet the drivers of this spatial and temporal heterogeneity are unknown. Through a multidisciplinary study of two parallel systems, we will tease apart influences of environmental, physiological, and microbial factors on human risk of tick-borne rickettsial infection. The model tick-borne disease (TBD) systems for this work target Amblyomma maculatum and Rickettsia parkeri in the US, and Amblyomma hebraeum and Rickettsia africae in Africa; both R. parkeri and R. africae are spotted fever group Rickettsia, known to cause disease in humans. R. parkeri has been found at high prevalence in A. maculatum at the leading edge of this tick's rapidly expanding range, and R. africae is endemic in southern Africa with few reported studies. TBD risk is occurring in locations where environmental conditions that affect pathogen-tick-host interactions or tick life history and behavior create new opportunities for pathogen exposure in humans. The US and African Amblyomma/Rickettsia systems will comparatively examine different aspects of the same phenomenon: the spatiotemporal heterogeneity in pathogen prevalence in ticks in different parts of the vector's distribution. In both systems, we will focus our study at sites at the edge and core of the ranges of A. maculatum and A. hebraeum. This proposal details a comprehensive approach to this question using a suite of targeted studies to inform mathematical models. Laboratory-based empirical determination of transmission rates will provide important life history information and determine model structure. Molecular studies of both host ticks and rickettsia will generate information on tick movements and population dynamics on bacterial strain variation and tick microbiomes. Field ecology studies will examine natural temporal and spatial variability of ticks and rickettsial pathogens, as well as influences of putative host community composition. Geospatial analyses will reveal the contribution of environmental factors to prevalence gradients and genetic structuring of ticks and rickettsia. Finally, all of this information will be synthesized in mathematical models to weigh relative importance of different drivers in these TBD systems and of TBD risk in general. Spatial heterogeneity in occurrence of disease vectors and vector-borne pathogens is fundamentally important to TBD risk, and this study gives us the unique opportunity to use a comparative approach to explore TBD occurrence in a number of theoretical contexts including dilution effects of host communities, core-margin effects on pathogen prevalence and vector abundance, and center of origin impacts on vector and pathogen population genetic structure. The proposed work will develop advanced mathematical models of tick-borne rickettsial infection dynamics that will be informed by transmission studies, microbiome analyses, population genetics, GIS, and remote sensing, and will provide a framework by which similar studies may be performed for other pathogens. Ultimately, these efforts will aid in risk assessment, control measures, and education efforts, in expanding tick ranges and areas of changing land use."
"9208441","PROJECT 5 PROJECT SUMMARY    Human  cytomegalovirus  (HCMV)  remains  a  significant  cause  of  morbidity  and  mortality  after  Hematopoietic  Stem  Cell  Transplantion  (HSCT)  and  Solid  Organ  Transplantation  (SOT).  A  commonly  encountered  clinical  manifestation  of  HCMV  infection  in  the  HSCT  or  SOT  recipient  is  myelosuppression.  HCMV  reactivation  and  use  of  the  antiviral  ganciclovir  is  associated  with  a  number  of  cytopenias  that  increase  the  risk  of  secondary  bacterial  or  fungal  infections  and  require  growth  factor  support  or  transfusion  of  blood  products.  Despite  the  clear  clinical  relevance  of  myelosuppression  to  the  transplant  recipient  with  HCMV  infection,  little  is  known  about  the  mechanism(s)  by  which  HCMV  infection  inhibits  normal  hematopoiesis.  HCMV  has  been  shown  to  inhibit  hematopoiesis  by  the  direct  infection  of  hematopoietic  progenitor  cells  (HPCs)  and  indirectly  by  the  effect of infected HPCs on the microenvironment supporting hematopoiesis.    We  have  recapitulated  HCMV  myelosuppression  in  vivo  using  a  humanized  mouse  model.  We  further show in both in vitro and in vivo models that the addition of increasing numbers of infected CD34+ HPCs  increases  the  degree  of  myelosuppression  and  that  supernatant  from  infected  CD34+  HPCs,  as  opposed  to  mock-­infected  HPCs,  suppresses  myelopoiesis.  Further,  Projects  1,  2,  3  and  4  have  identified  viral  proteins  and miRNAs that directly alter signaling and either promote or suppress hematopoiesis in vitro. Therefore, we  hypothesize  that  HCMV  infection  reprograms  signaling  and  cytokine  secretion  in  infected  cells  resulting  in  a  microenvironment that inhibits hematopoiesis and contributes to clinical myelosuppression and hematopoietic  failure. To test our hypothesis, we propose a systems approach to define the changes in signaling and cytokine  secretion using both in vitro and in vivo models. We propose the following specific aims. Specific Aim 1.  How  does HCMV infection of CD34+ HPCs in vitro regulate hematopoiesis? We hypothesize that HCMV suppresses  CD34+  HPC  differentiation  by  altering  signaling  and  secretion  in  the  infected  cell.  Specific  Aim  2.  How  does  HCMV  regulate  hematopoiesis  in  vivo?  We  hypothesize  that  HCMV  infection  alters  the  microenvironment  for  hematopoiesis in the host organism. Specific Aim 3.  What are the molecular signatures associated with HCMV  myelosuppression  in  HSCT  and  SOT  patients?  We  hypothesize  that  HCMV-­mediated  changes  in  cytokine  secretion impede hematopoietic reconstitution in HSCT and SOT patients.   IMPACT: Taken together, our project provides a unique opportunity to make unprecedented advancements  in  our  understanding  of  the  mechanistic  basis  of  HCMV-­mediated  myelosuppression.  This  advancement  is  driven  by  the  development  of  the  state-­of-­the-­art  huBLT  mouse  model  and  the  identification  of  virus-­host  interactions impacting hematopoiesis and the key cytokine and molecular signatures that predict disease.  "
"9209611","ABSTRACT Infections with high-risk sub-types of Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) are responsible for more than 99% of all cervical carcinoma cases in the US. Our recent data in collaboration with Dr. Hagensee laboratory has shown that co-detection of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) with HPV in cervical samples increases the risk of concurrent cervical dysplasia by 4-6 fold. In addition, HIV+ women from New Orleans (n=531) with detectable cervical HPV and EBV are at higher risk (69%) for concurrent squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) as compared to only 28% of women with only detectable HPV (p<0.001; OR 5.57, 95%CI 2.19-14.4). We hypothesize that EBV acts as a co-factor for progression of HPV-related cervical cancers. We will address this hypothesis directly using innovative 3-dimensional (3D) epithelial models of co-infection. First, using a well-characterized 3D model of terminally differentiated keratinocytes, we will determine whether co-infection with HPV and EBV adversely affects normal differentiation of the stratified multi-layer epithelium compared to HPV alone. Using targeted molecular methods, we will dissect the augmenting capacity of EBV's oncoprotein, LMP-1, for cellular transformation in the context of high-risk HPV types. Importantly, the proposed outcome measures will also address epithelial transformation in the context of the low-risk HPV6 because HPV6 is found more frequently in women shedding EBV, and since EBV's augmenting capacity might be greater in otherwise low-risk types. Parallel experiments will be performed in primary and/or HPV-immortalized human ectocervical epithelial cells. Utilizing expertise from all members of the COBRE team, the innovative 3D epithelial models utilized herein will facilitate a powerful and direct investigation of whether co-infection with EBV enhances malignant transformation. Specifically, these models allow for visualization of the stratified epithelial architecture and invasion of the underlying stromal layer, quantification of basal cell proliferation, and several outcomes not achievable with conventional 2D (monolayer) models. Also unique to the 3D model, we have the ability to produce and utilize infectious HPV thus allowing for co-infection with live viruses rather than modeling HPV infection by retroviral transduction of E6/E7 oncogenes. The mentoring duo of Drs. Alison Quayle and Augusto Ochoa, combined with consulting provided by Drs. Michelle Ozbun and Hagensee, will provide excellent scientific leadership to proposed COBRE mentee Dr. Chris McGowin. In line with the goals of the COBRE mechanism, the combined track record of the proposed mentors for training of junior investigators will provide Chris a rich environment conducive for translating his findings into independent R01 funding."
"9387085","Project Summary This secondary data analysis addresses specific questions regarding the pathways by which childhood sexual trauma (CST) experienced by the mother may place her and her children on life course trajectories for maladaptive developmental outcomes. The current study will use a subsample (N = 204) of the Family Life Project (FLP). The subsample is comprised of 105 mothers with childhood sexual trauma (CST) histories and 99 mothers without CST histories and was created using propensity score matching procedures to control for mother's family of origin demographic variables. Given that 19% of women report childhood sexual trauma in the United States, a significant number of children are living in homes with mothers reporting trauma histories making this an important direction for further inquiry. The past three decades have seen an explosion of interest in the long-term consequences of CST and its association with the socioemotional adjustment of survivors and their children. Prior research links CST history with numerous domains of adult interpersonal functioning, including elevated depression and intimate partner violence (IPV), and problems in the parental role. Children of mothers with trauma histories are reported to have a myriad of developmental problems when compared to children of women without trauma history. Despite the growing interest reflected in the literature, there is still much we do not know or understand about the mechanisms by which maternal trauma may be related to the development of the next generation. Our goal is to identify the processes by which maternal CST may be related to key domains of child functioning which have been linked to short- and long-term success in school and beyond: socioemotional and cognitive development. We will examine the stability of depression, IPV, and parenting behavior across early childhood from 6-60months for mothers with and without CST, and examine the developmental outcomes of children as a function of maternal CST history. Our working hypotheses posit that elevated levels of maternal depression and IPV often reported by mothers with CST histories are primary factors influencing parenting behavior and thereby influencing the development of offspring. A major area of innovation include the use of a rich longitudinal dataset that has a comprehensive array of behavioral, caregiving, and ecological measures from age 6 months ? first grade allowing us, perhaps for the first time, to examine the intergenerational transmission of childhood sexual trauma. To our knowledge this is the first study of its kind to test complex longitudinal relations among early adversity and key outcomes in a racially and economically diverse sample."

"9324078","Project Summary The failure of experimental therapeutics for Alzheimer?s disease (AD) in clinical studies emphasizes the need for validation of novel therapeutic targets with new mechanism of action. One strategy is to look to the body?s natural defense mechanisms. Postmortem studies of AD patients and aged-matched controls have confounded researchers for years with evidence of known pathological markers of AD in control groups with lack of cognitive impairments. Rather than asking if elevated beta-amyloid and neurofibrillary tangles are detrimental for neuronal function and survival, since this has collectively and repeatedly been demonstrated, a more interesting question is, ?Why do many individuals have normal cognition, despite these pathological abnormalities?? The noradrenergic (NE) system is a key modulator of cognitive function, neuroinflammation and the systemic immune system. Severe degeneration of NE neurons in AD patients may underlie disease progression at many levels. Adrenergic receptors on microglia play critical roles in regulating neuroinflammation and governing protective mechanisms for neuronal function and survival. Migration of peripheral immune cells to the brain is also regulated by NE tone and may be impaired in AD patients. This proposal will determine the role of NE and beta adrenergic 1 and 2 receptor subtypes (ADRB1 and ADRB2) in AD-like cognitive deficits, neuroinflammation, and pathology using a platform of well-established learning and memory paradigms, transgenic models of mice overexpressing human amyloid precursor protein, and DREADD technology specifically targeting NE neurons in the locus ceruleus to reduce NE tone followed by restoration of tone at ADRB1 and ADRB2 with selective pharmacology. Innovative flow cytometry analysis of brain, blood, spleen and bone marrow will identify effects of modulation of NE tone on resident microglia, systemic immune cells and recruitment of systemic immune cells to the brain. Development of transgenic mice in which ADRB1 and ADRB2 can be conditionally deleted in myeloid lineage cells (e.g., microglia and macrophages, but not neurons) will enable the exploration of the cell-type and receptor subtype specificity of previously described effects of NE in modulation of AD-related behavior and pathophysiology in vivo. Subsequent experiments using an in vitro culture platform of isolated microglia/macrophages from transgenic and wildtype mice, with the ability to conditionally delete ADRB1 and ADRB2, will examine the receptor subtype dependent effects of NE on microglia/macrophage proliferation and phagocytosis."
"9323562","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important factor in the control of gene regulation is the 3-dimensional organization of the nucleus, which is dynamically assembled and regulated in different cellular states. Yet, how this nuclear organization is established and how it dynamically changes across cell states is largely unknown. Recently, several nuclear- retained long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to be important for shaping 3-dimensional genome organization. It is currently unknown how many of the thousands of chromatin-associated lncRNAs may similarly be important for shaping nuclear organization. The main challenge in addressing this question is that we currently lack the tools to comprehensively integrate RNA into our understanding of genome organization. Current genome-wide methods for mapping RNA-DNA interactions can only map a single RNA at a time, do not provide information about the 3-dimensional interaction of their targets, provide an ensemble view derived from millions of cells, and provide an aggregate picture across all RNA molecules, rather than single molecule resolution of RNA localization in the nucleus. Here, we aim to develop a novel approach to enable comprehensive single molecule mapping of the 3-dimensional DNA targets of all RNA molecules within thousands of single nuclei. First, we will a develop a novel genome-wide sequencing method that will enable the generation of comprehensive single molecule maps of the 3-dimensional DNA targets of all RNA molecules in the nucleus (Aim 1). Next, we will develop novel microfluidic devices that will enable the measurement of RNA-DNA nuclear compartments in hundreds to thousands of individual nuclei (Aim 2). Finally, we will extend this technology to study the single cell temporal dynamics of RNA-DNA interactions across cellular reprogramming and functionally validate these maps by testing the role of several identified RNAs in nuclear organization (Aim 3). These methods will overcome a major barrier by enabling, for the first time, comprehensive exploration of the role of nuclear-retained RNAs in shaping nuclear structure. Furthermore, these methods will provide transformative tools for studying nuclear structure - beyond the immediate questions explored in this proposal; we expect that these tools will be generally applicable to many additional questions for understanding nuclear structure in single cells."
"9391915","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Coordination between cell division and differentiation is essential for mammalian development and tissue homeostasis. Early in embryonic development cell division and differentiation undergo a major transition during gastrulation. Prior to gastrulation, the gap phases of the cell cycle of the rapidly dividing pluripotent cells are extremely short.. During gastrulation, the gap phases lengthen and the rate of cell division decreases. Furthermore, genes that show periodic expression during the cell cycle phases in adult somatic cells, do not oscillate in pluripotent cells. However, very little is known about when and how during early mammalian development, these genes begin to oscillate with cell cycle phases and the relationship of this oscillation to extension of gap phases.. Given the intimate connection between cell division and differentiation, the establishment of periodic cell cycle expression is likely to play a central role in cell fate decisions. The objective for this exploratory grant is to identify genes induced to periodically oscillate during mammalian gastrulation as well as differences in the genes that oscillate between lineages following gastrulation. The central hypothesis is that the number of oscillating genes markedly increases coincident with the emergence of somatic cell fates during gastrulation and that the identity of many of these oscillating genes differs between post-gastrulation cell lineages. To address the hypothesis, two aims are proposed: 1) Identify transcript oscillation induced during gastrulation and 2) identify lineage-specific oscillating transcripts following gastrulation. For aim 1, single-cell transcriptomes of pre-gastrulation epiblast cells and gastrulating somatic cells will be captured from cells sorted based on DNA content. The identity of periodically expressed genes from these two developmental stages will be compared with a collection of bioinformatics tools. Differentially oscillating genes will be validated by single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). For aim 2, post-gastrulation embryos will be dissociated, sorted based on DNA content and their transcriptomes single-cell sequenced. The gene expression signature of these cells will be used to separate cells into distinct embryonic lineages. Transcript oscillation will be identified as differential expression across phases within each lineage and compared between lineages to find lineage-specific oscillation programs. These will be validated by single molecule FISH. This proposal is highly significant as it will elucidate cell cycle programs that emerge during, and therefore likely regulate, cell fate decisions. Future studies where these programs are targeted or functionally manipulated could redirect cell fate or uniquely alter proliferation in select lineages."

"9328011","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Project 2 Cancer is one of the leading causes of human mortality worldwide. Owing to its highly heterogeneous nature, and evolutionary cell populations dynamics, it is also one of the most treatment-resistant diseases. Vast majority of cancer related deaths are due to invasive and ultimately metastatic spread of tumor cells. To target cancer metastasis, new insights are required from orthogonal perspectives. In Project #1, we propose to investigate the fundamental mechanisms responsible for initiation and progression of cancer metastasis with a focus on the cell-autonomous characteristics of cancer cells. In project #2 we propose to focus on non-cell- autonomous control of invasive process, i.e., those involving cell-cell interactions, both within invading tumors and at the tumor-stroma interface.  Our preliminary data, as well as accumulating evidence from other labs indicate that cancer invasion is a collective cell behavior, involving a variety of cell-cell interactions that shape the possibility and extent of cancer progression. Importantly, many of the regulatory pathways and networks, and the associated phenotypes involved in invasion, are shared by normal physiological processes, including wound healing, placental implantation into endometrium, and blood vessel growth. In an innovative approach, we will capitalize on the differences between normal invasive processes in different species and corresponding differences in the aggressive cancer progression in the same species, to gain comparative evolution-based insights into factors promoting and arresting invasive spread. We will test these insights by focusing on hetero-typic interactions between cancer and stromal cells (Aim 1) and homo-typic interactions among cancer cells adopting different phenotypes (Aim 2).  A key novel hypothesis that will be tested in this analysis is that cancer-stromal interactions can yield novel targets that are stromal-specific and, as such, will be less subject to development of drug resistance, if considered as a part of new therapeutic development. Furthermore, we hypothesize that disruption of interaction between aggressive, migratory cancer cells and their proliferative counterparts can decrease the degree and effect of invasive cancer spread. The results of this analysis are thus expected to lead to new approaches to controlling invasive cancer spread."
"9301412","7. Project Summary- PESC The purpose of the UM-OAIC Pilot and Exploratory Studies Core (PESC) is to provide critical, initial funding for pilot and exploratory studies that are consistent with the Center?s overall goals of: 1) advancing our understanding of the mechanisms by which exercise and activity-based rehabilitation interventions directed at specific impairments affect multiple body systems underlying functional performance; and 2) developing and testing interventions to restore function and minimize disability following acute disabling events and gradual declines related to serious chronic diseases. To meet this objective, the PESC will provide research support and mentoring of investigators with high quality pilot and exploratory research proposals designed to acquire preliminary data needed for future crucial studies congruent with the Center?s focus. Priorities for awards include relevance to the UM-OAIC goal, potential for subsequent independent funding, new multidisciplinary collaborations and translational potential. PESC funding and mentoring of junior faculty in the conduct of pilot projects are essential to ensure the 1) coordination of innovative translational approaches to research in exercise and rehabilitation sciences; 2) investigation of the mechanisms underlying mobility limitation, physical disability, recovery and the prevention of disability in vulnerable older adults; and 3) assessment of the functional and clinical responses to novel exercise and activity-based rehabilitation interventions. Five innovative pilot studies will be supported in the first year of this competitive renewal. These studies will investigate: 1) the feasibility of delivering a home-based intervention for hip fracture patients with cognitive impairment; 2) an innovative hip abductor function intervention for older adults at risk for falls; 3) novel functional genetic biomarkers for upper arm motor recovery in chronic stroke patients using genome-wide expression profiling and DNA methylation; 4) phenotyping in Parkinson?s disease using a portable biosensor device, and 5) inflammatory biomarkers and neuropsychiatric changes after hip fracture. The preliminary data obtained in these studies will form the basis for larger, investigator-initiated studies to advance our ability to improve outcomes from disabling conditions in older persons and develop the careers of new academic leaders pursuing research in this important area."
"9319163","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The Developmental Therapeutics Core (DTC) works with RHLCCC investigators to facilitate translation of new oncology therapeutic agents to the clinic. DTC provides a range of services that include in vitro tumor cell line assays such as the NCI60 panel, proliferation, apoptosis, cytotoxicity, migration and invasion assays. Animal studies run by DTC include a variety of subcutaneous and orthotopic models of tumor growth and metastasis that can be used to study mechanism and evaluate new drug candidates, exploratory pharmacokinetics (in collaboration with the RHLCCC funded Clinical Pharmacology Core), and exploratory toxicology including histopathological evaluation. In addition, DTC assist investigators with drug formulation and initial assessments of drug stability. DTC staff are proficient using all routes of administration including PO by gavage, IV, IP, and SC and in small animal surgery, which allows for implantation of osmotic minipumps for continuous infusion. To date, DTC has collaborated with a broad spectrum of different investigators including clinicians looking to evaluate new drugs or combinations before moving these into the clinic and basic science researchers such as chemists or individuals who lack tumor biology or animal model expertise. DTC has also collaborated with the Center for Molecular Innovation and Drug Discovery (CMIDD) to carry out initial in vitro evaluation for a number of early discovery projects. DTC also advises on study design and provides consulting and training to faculty and students. DTC has been able to accelerate implementation of studies by working with the lACUC to set up and manage a number of blanket proposals under which it can run most of these studies that it engages in simply by filing a one page study-specific addendum describing the cell line used, if applicable, and the drug to be studied. DTG routinely adds fellows and students to these protocols in order to facilitate hands-on training. DTC currently has one full time and one part time FTE in addition to the director but is in the process of hiring two additional research associates to meet the growing demand for its services. DTC currently occupies bench and office space in Silverman Hall West it carries out all of its animal work in the vivarium that is located in Pancoe Hall, which adjoins Silverman Hall. In addition, DTC carries out a number of studies in collaboration with the Molecular and Translational Imaging Core (MTIC). DTC routinely labels most of its cell lines using Luc2 and dTomato (bioluminescence and fluorescence, respectively), which allows real time monitoring of orthotopic tumor growth and metastasis using the IMTIC facilities for this purpose. Finally, in addition to increasing staff to meet the demand for existing models, DTC is collaborating with the pathology core facility (PCF) to develop a novel repository of patient-derived xenografts across a variety of histologies that will only be passaged in vivo."
"9328126","Tobacco smoke is a very complex sample, containing upwards of 4800 individual substances (Hoffmann, Hoffmann et al. 2001, Baker, Bishop 2004, Thielena, Klusb et al. 2008). The volatility of these substances vanes over a large range as does the concentration. Some of the substances are additives to the tobacco, but most are products of pyrolysis/combustion of natural components of tobacco, e.g. cellulose. The relatively high temperature (~ 950 °C) allows complex reactions to occur, generating a very diverse collection of compounds. However, almost two-thirds of additives undergo <5% decomposition or reaction (Baker, Bishop 2004). The compounds are distributed between the gas phase are particle phase (liquid aerosol). For organic compounds, about 75% are in the particle phase and 25% in the gas phase. Sampling the particles is a very challenging task. Typically particles are collected on filters,  extracted (and sometimes derivatized), and then analyzed by GC/MS or LC/MS (Figure 1). It has been known for some time that artifacts can be produced in this procedure. We have confirmed this using the setup shown in Figure 1. Research in our lab has recently been focused on developing new approaches to reduce or eliminate collection/extraction steps in the analysis of smoke, to minimize artifact formation."
"9349498","ABSTRACT Fluorescence is the current standard method of choice for intravital microscopy and cytometry. However, the broad emission spectrum of fluorescent probes?dyes, fluorescent probes, and quantum dots?limits the number of cells that can be tracked simultaneously without ambiguity. DNA barcodes can label cells but cannot be visualized in vivo, as they require in vitro genetic reading. The optical principle of stimulated emission and cavity resonance used in a laser can generate extremely narrow spectral line-widths over a broad spectral range. This project will miniaturize lasers to the sizes of mitochondria or viruses and develop instrumentations to utilize the laser particles as novel probes for massively parallel imaging and assays. By tracing individual cells over time in mice, the proliferation, migrations and cell-cell and cell-tissue interactions can be studied in vivo. The cells can be further analyzed by flow cytometry and sorted for gene profiling and single-cell RNA sequencing, providing comprehensive information from molecular, cellular, tissue, and systems levels over millions to billions of cells in a single animal experiment. The first specific aim is to create a new paradigm for imaging-compatible cellular labeling using injectable, biocompatible micro- and submicron-cavity lasers. The second aim is to develop Laser Particle Stimulated Emission (LASE) Microscopy for conducting labeled microscopy in vivo at depths of up to 3 mm. The third specific aim is to demonstrate massively multiplexed, high-throughput cell tracking and analysis. The breakthrough capabilities will be used to dissect tumor heterogeneity in progression, metastasis, and response to therapy at unprecedented single-cell resolution."
"9392394","Abstract  Since its introduction, in May 2015, the mosquito-borne Zika virus (ZIKV) has rapidly spread to more than 40 countries throughout the South Pacific and the Americas. The association between infection with ZIKV while pregnant and the occurrence of microcephaly in the fetus has raised a significant public health concern. To date, there is no effective antiviral treatment or vaccine to combat this rapidly escalating pandemic.  The primary focus of this R21 application is to develop a novel Zika virus (ZIKV) capsid-capsid interaction assay and employ it to screen and identify chemical inhibitors of ZIKV replication. The formation of the ZIKV capsid protein dimer is a prerequisite to executing multiple functions in the virus lifecycle. Previous studies on other ZIKV-related C proteins have provided ample evidence that a relatively subtle perturbation in the efficiency and timing of C protein dimerization can disrupt proper viral assembly/disassembly and block virus infectivity. A recently described Dengue virus capsid assembly inhibitor supports the feasibility of our approach in exploring the ZIKV capsid as a target for anti-ZIKV drug discovery.  Successful completion of this project will allow us develop a novel high-throughput assay for identifying ZIKV capsid assembly/disassembly inhibitors. The compounds identified through this work can be further studied to develop viable anti-ZIKV drug candidates that could be used for treatment of ZIKV infection in humans."
"9430579","Astrocytes remove the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate from the extracellular space following neuronal activity via sodium-driven, voltage-dependent excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs). Robust glutamate uptake by EAATs ensures the temporal and spatial fidelity of glutamate signaling. Interestingly, we recently found that neuronal activity rapidly (within milliseconds) and reversibly slows glutamate uptake in the adult cerebral cortex. This slowing prolongs neuronal NMDA responses, consistent with prolonged extracellular glutamate dynamics, and is highly dependent on the frequency and duration of stimulation. Additionally, glutamate clearance can be modulated by neuronal activity with synapse specificity, even within a single astrocyte. We believe this may have important consequences on neurotransmission, extrasynaptic receptor activation, and synaptic plasticity. Based on that exciting finding, we hypothesized that neuronal activity induces microdomain-level changes in astrocyte membrane potential (Vm) that locally modulate EAAT function. GLT1 is the predominant astrocytic EAAT in the adult forebrain, is abundantly expressed, and ensures that glutamate in the extracellular space is rapidly sequestered by EAAT binding. Once bound to EAATs, the transport of glutamate into the astrocyte is both sodium-driven and voltage-dependent. Under normal conditions, astrocytes are hyperpolarized (-80 mV) due to their high permeability to potassium. However, neuronal activity increases extracellular potassium, [K ]e, and astrocyte Vm is especially sensitive to [K ]e changes. Therefore, it stands to reason that neuronal activity can alter EAAT function by depolarizing astrocytes. Changes in astrocytic Vm may be especially relevant in fine astrocytic processes, where EAATs are concentrated, and where small intracellular volumes may amplify changes in Vm, as compared to soma. A major challenge to testing our hypothesis, however, is an inability to monitor astrocyte Vm at distal processes due to low membrane resistance and process morphology. Overcoming this challenge is important because astrocyte distal processes are the site of synaptic interaction and EAATs localization. In order to detect distal changes in astrocyte Vm, we have begun to develop an approach to image Vm in astrocyte processes using QuasAr, a genetically-encoded voltage sensor. Dr. Adam Cohen, who developed QuasArs, is a collaborator on this proposal. Utilizing astrocyte and neuron electrophysiological recording, optogenetic manipulation of astrocyte Vm, and QuasAr imaging of astrocyte membrane potential we have generated preliminary data that supports our hypothesis that EAAT function can be modulated by activity-induced changes in astrocyte Vm. "
"9336836","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Women who have served in the military are a rapidly growing minority in the US population and the fastest growing group of new users in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Recent studies suggest that compared to civilians, women Veterans report significantly higher rates of trauma exposure and consequent high rates of PTSD. Despite the existence of evidence-based treatments for PTSD, most women Veterans underutilize VA care. One innovation in treatment delivery that has the potential to reach and engage these women is use of the Internet to administer treatment. A few web-based CBT interventions for PTSD have been developed and evaluated. However, all but one of these evaluations was conducted outside of the US and with civilian populations. The exception, Delivery of Self Training and Education for Stressful Situations (DESTRESSS), has been primarily tested on male service members and Veterans; only a handful of women participated in the two clinical trials evaluating its efficacy. Thus, ther are limited data on its efficacy for this population, suggesting the need to evaluate whether it wil meet the needs of women Veterans. Moreover, DESTRESS may not be optimal for women as it was not designed to target women Veterans' unique trauma experiences and needs. For example, DESTRESS does not include psychoeducation on interpersonal traumas nor does it address social support and relationship concerns central to women Veterans. To this end, we propose to conduct qualitative research with women Veterans and clinicians with content expertise to elicit their feedback on DESTRESS, make modifications to the program based on this feedback, and then conduct a pilot randomized clinical trial (RCT) evaluating the revised web-based, phone-assisted intervention with phone support only. Specifically, in Phase I we will conduct semi-structured interviews with 20 women Veterans with PTSD as well as with 4-6 expert providers regarding their impressions of DESTRESS. Changes will be made to DESTRESS as a result of this formative work, and the same women Veterans and expert providers will be re-interviewed to provide feedback on the changes made. In Phase II, we will conduct a pilot RCT wherein 70 women Veterans with PTSD are randomized to the intervention or phone support only. Measures of PTSD symptom severity (primary outcome) and depression and quality of life (secondary outcomes) will be collected at baseline, post-treatment, and 12- and 24-week follow-up assessments. Information about program utilization, dropout, patient satisfaction, and acceptability will also be collected. The long-term objective of this line of research is to develop low cost, accessible interventions for women Veterans with PTSD. Findings should improve our general knowledge about women Veterans' responses and preferences for care regarding tailored treatments for them, as well as result in an innovative, web-based intervention for women Veterans with PTSD."
"9357381","Project Summary  Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are adult stem cells with roles in angiogenesis and endothelial function. Human and animal studies suggest that autologous stem cell therapy using an EPC enriched population of cells can be therapeutic in diseases such as hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke, and diabetes. However, EPCs from diseased and aging hosts show decreases in number and function that are likely to compromise therapeutic efficacy, thus masking the potential of EPC based therapy. The objective of this study is to determine the mechanism of impaired angiogenic competency of EPCs in an animal model of EPC dysfunction. In the proposed animal model, the SS/MCWi (SS) rat, EPC competency and longevity is impaired in vivo but rescued in vitro. We have observed an increase in the natural killer (NK) cell receptor 2B4 (CD244) on the membrane of SS EPCs and an increase in killing of SS EPCs by SS NK cells. We hypothesize that increased expression of CD244 on the EPC membrane leads to increased NK cell mediated destruction of SS EPCs in vivo, which compromises their ability to induce angiogenesis. We will use an in vitro cytotoxicity assay and an in vivo model of hind-limb angiogenesis to test the effects of CD244 knockdown and NK cell depletion on NK cell mediated destruction and angiogenic competency of SS EPCs. We will also assess the physiological impact of the various observed CD244 transcript sequences in an in vitro cell culture system. Because we have previously shown that low-dose angiotensin II (AngII) restores angiogenesis in SS rats and angiogenic competency in SS bone marrow mononuclear cells, we will assess the effects of AngII on the angiogenic competency, CD244 expression, and NK cell mediated cytotoxicity of SS EPCs."
"9490833","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The proposed studies are part of our long-range effort to study the fundamental mechanisms of transcription and its regulation using bacterial model systems. Proper control of gene regulation is critical for organismal development, cellular response to environmental signals, and the prevention of disease states. The first step in gene expression, transcription, is carried out by multi-subunit RNA polymerases (RNAPs) that are conserved in sequence, structure and function from bacteria to humans. Thus, a detailed mechanistic understanding of transcription in bacteria facilitates an understanding of transcription in all organisms. The proposed studies will apply a comprehensive approach combining genetics, biochemistry, structural biology, genomic, and high- throughput sequencing based methods to (1) understand the diversity of regulatory mechanisms that link changes to cellular state to changes in the activity of RNAP and (2) obtain a quantitative understanding of transcription that defines the mechanistic basis for each step of transcription and confers the ability to predict transcriptional output from the DNA sequence content of a gene. We tackle these areas by developing new methodologies to understand the interface between DNA sequence and RNAP function, and to reexamine long-held notions of RNAP function for unexpected paradigms or unknown biology."
"9329412","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many of the 3.5 million children currently infected with HIV-1 worldwide are expected to reach adulthood and develop chronic kidney disease (CKD). Very little is known about how HIV-1 induces chronic renal injury in these children, and our pediatric HIV-program is currently in a unique position to address this problem. Recently we found that TNF-? facilitates the establishment of a low level productive infection of cultured podocytes and human glomerular endothelial cells (HGEc) through a trans-membrane TNF-?-envelope- mediated mechanism that is independent of CD4, and is associated with an up-regulated expression of the ApoL-1 risk alleles that are associated with CKD and hypertension (HTN) in people of African ancestry. Furthermore, we found that (i) podocytes and HGEc that are primed by HIV-1 and Tumor Necrosis Factor -? (TNF-?) undergo paradoxical apoptosis or cell death when exposed to Fibroblast Growth Factor-2 (FGF-2); (ii) podocytes expressing HIV-1 genes, and Nef alone, secrete molecules that impair the angiogenic behavior and survival of HGEc; (iii) Renal tubular epithelial cells and macrophages isolated from children with HIV- renal diseases (HIV-RD) secrete an FGF binding protein (FGF-BP-1) that enhances the vascular activity of Angiotensin II (Ang II) and causes HTN in mice; and (iv) HIV-Tat, alone or in combination with FGF-2, precipitates the development of CKD and tubular salt wasting disorders in HIV-Tg26 mice. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that HIV-1 and TNF-? impair the ability of renal epithelial cells and HGEc to survive or regenerate when exposed to FGF-2, affecting the regeneration of glomerular capillaries, and precipitating the development of CKD and HTN. In aim 1, we will define whether HIV-1 and TNF-? prime mature podocytes and HGEc to undergo apoptosis or cell death when exposed to FGF-2, and define whether podocyte precursors are more resistant to HIV-infection and less susceptible to TNF-? + FGF-2 mediated cell death. In aim 2 we will define how factors secreted by podocytes expressing HIV-genes, or Nef alone, affect the angiogenic behavior of HGEc, and identify the most relevant signaling pathways and soluble factors involved in this process. In aim 3 we will test the hypothesis that HIV-1 can cause HTN through the induction of chronic endothelial injury and contractility changes in vascular smooth muscle cells, via an Ang II- mediated mechanism that involves FGF-BP-1, FGF-2 and Rho-A activation. Here, we will use Tat-inducible HIV-Tg26 to determine whether HIV-1 genes impair the expression of Ang II receptors in renal tubules and induce a salt wasting disorder that delays the onset of HTN in patients with HIVAN. This study will fill a unique gap in our knowledge of childhood HIV-RD, and define how HIV-1 affects the bidirectional crosstalk between podocytes and HGEc precipitating the development of CKD and HTN."
"9408787","More than 500,000 U.S. patients have end stage renal disease and over 80% utilize hemodialysis as their renal replacement modality of choice. The Achilles Heel in the care of dialysis patients is the development of a functioning and durable vascular access, preferably an arteriovenous fistula (AVF). The annual cost of treating vascular access dysfunction totals over one billion US dollars. This is largely due to the high proportion of AVFs that fail to mature. After creation, sixty percent of AVFs fail to mature successfully for dialysis use, due to early venous neointimal development and inadequate vasodilation. At present, there are no effective therapies to promote vascular access maturation. Endomimetics has developed a nitric oxide (NO) releasing nanomatrix gel that mimics the characteristic properties of native endothelium. This nanomatrix can be applied on the dialysis AVF at the time of creation. In our Phase I SBIR, the nanomatrix gel demonstrated release of NO over 30 days, inhibited neointimal hyperplasia, and reduced expression of inflammatory markers in a rat AVF model. The Endomimetics nanomatrix gel is a biocompatible peptide based material and minimizes the risk of inflammatory responses. In this Phase II SBIR, we propose to evaluate the efficacy of the nanomatrix gel for AVF maturation at a clinically relevant time point. Aim 1 will include evaluation of gelation properties, ex vivo blood vessel dilation, and assessment of NO effects on inhibition of inflammation. In collaboration with Dr. Lee at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Aims 2 and 3 will evaluate the efficacy of the Endomimetics nanomatrix gel in an established rodent AVF model, and in a porcine model. Development of the Endomimetics NO releasing nanomatrix gel that promotes AVF maturation may have significant impact in the treatment of patients requiring dialysis. With successful completion of Phase II, we plan to move forward in discussion with the FDA."

"9358313","Summary Shortage of available allogeneic donor organs represents the greatest unmet medical need in the field of transplantation today. The survival of pig-to-primate organ transplants has improved markedly over the past three decades but unfortunately remains insufficient for clinical application. Further progress in this field will likely depend upon genetic modifications of porcine source animals both to overcome molecular incompatibilities with primate recipients and to allow the induction of immunological tolerance. The objectives of this proposal are to produce such pigs and to identify additional genetic modifications that will help attain the goal of clinically relevant xenograft survival. Advanced genetic engineering techniques, including site-specific recombinase-driven gene additions and edits using the precision CRISPR-Cas9 system, will be used to effectively deliver multiple genetic modifications affecting complement activation, coagulation and barriers to induction of mixed hematopoietic chimerism to achieve tolerance. These modifications will be made efficiently and rapidly by applying state-of-the-art genomic sequencing and guide RNA design specifically tailored to the highly inbred MGH miniature swine to be engineered. Genetically modified pigs incorporating the new modifications will be tested in Projects 1, 2, and 3 for efficacy in promoting organ survival and mixed chimerism for tolerance induction in primate and humanized mouse models."
"9301409","7. Project Summary- Resource Core 2 Cardiovascular deconditioning, chronic inflammation, and endocrine-metabolic dysfunction are inherent to the pathophysiology of the physical impairments in older persons hindered by disabling chronic diseases of aging. Sarcopenia, poor fitness, inflammation, and acute events causing disability -- such as falls, stroke, and hip fracture -- occur with advancing age and may worsen mobility and increase risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and metabolic abnormalities. The Applied Physiology and Tissue Mechanisms Resource Core?s (RC-2) hypothesis is that exercise and activity-based rehabilitation can improve multiple physiological systems in older, mobility-limited individuals, leading to improved functional performance, reduced cardiometabolic disease risk, and prevention of functional decline. This core focuses on the following specific aims: 1)To facilitate the conduct of musculoskeletal and tissue mechanistic exercise rehabilitation and preventive biomedical research in aging and disability across the UM-OAIC pilot projects, UM-OAIC scholars? research, Development Projects (DPs), and external NIH and VA funded research; and 2)To provide research support, mentoring, and training to UM-OAIC scholars, junior faculty, and UM-OAIC researchers in the performance of aging research relevant to exercise and rehabilitation-based restoration of function and the prevention of functional declines in older people with chronic disabling diseases. RC-2 leadership and investigators represent a multidisciplinary team of basic scientists with clinical geriatricians who have worked together for 15-20 years. The characterization of the clinical and metabolic phenotype(s) of individuals with stroke, hip fracture, and other chronic disabling diseases in RC-2 have allowed UM-OAIC investigators to develop successful specific exercise rehabilitation strategies to improve functional and clinical outcomes. Thus this core, in collaboration with the other UM-OAIC cores, will continue to support innovative research studies examining the mechanisms and physiological effects of multisystem rehabilitation and preventive strategies on functional and physiological outcomes in older adults aging with chronic disabilities, with translation of these outcomes in novel clinical trials."
"9527916","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The NU SCOR explores the overarching hypothesis that genetic variation resulting in hyperandrogenemia produces the phenotypic features of the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) by androgen programming in utero as well as by ongoing androgen actions at critical developmental periods and in the adult. We have found sex-specific metabolic phenotypes in PCOS families, mapped several PCOS susceptibility genes, developed animal models of androgen programming and discovered that androgen-mediated estrogen resistance is an important mechanism for these androgen actions. It is clear that the genes for PCOS so far identified do not explain the high heritability of this disorder. We will investigate te mechanisms for this deficit in heritability as well as the molecular mechanisms by which estrogen resistance can produce obesity and metabolic abnormalities in PCOS. Our strategy for achieving the SCOR objectives is to directly investigate the genetic, epigenetic and hormonal determinants PCOS in three highly interactive, synergistic and interdisciplinary projects: Projects I and II are clinical research projects and Projects III will utilize a novel non-human primate model. Although each project is discrete, the proposed SCOR as a whole will continue to comprehensively investigate novel mechanisms for the pathogenesis of PCOS. Project I will test the hypothesis that rare genetic variants will account for much of the deficit in heritabilityof PCOS. We predict that we will identify rare variants in pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of PCOS in mapping of common variants, such as TGF¿ signaling, Wnt signaling, insulin signaling, gonadotropin action and extracellular matrix, as well as rare variants in genes in novel  pathways. Project II will test the hypothesis that a significant component of the heritability of PCOS is due to epigenetic changes including variation in methylation patterns, that these changes in methylation patterns correlate with changes in expression patterns, and that these changes in methylation are due to either specific changes in the DNA or environmental factors including the in utero environment. Project III will develop a novel non-human primate (marmoset) model of diet-induced obesity to test the hypothesis that androgenic programming of metabolic features of PCOS is mediated by induction of resistance to the actions of estradiol in target hypothalamic neurons that modulate energy homeostasis. These studies are extremely innovative, highly synergistic and likely to have a major impact on the field through elucidating the pathogenesis of PCOS and its metabolic phenotypes."
"9315759","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cell-to-cell signaling in bacteria, also known as quorum sensing, involves the production and detection of small molecules, or pheromones, that are exchanged between bacteria. Quorum sensing is used to coordinate important physiological processes such as virulence development, biofilm production, and the ability to transfer genetic information between cells, also known as competence. Genetic disruption of these pathways can severely affect the capability of bacteria to perform those functions. Therefore, defining these signaling mechanisms, and developing methods to interfere with them could provide novel strategies to treat bacterial infections. Streptococcus mutans, the primary agent of dental caries,  uses a quorum sensing pathway involving a short peptide pheromone called XIP and its cognate receptor, ComR. XIP develops from a precursor peptide called ComS that is secreted from the cell and processed into the mature pheromone. For XIP to be detected, it is transported into the cytosol where it is bound by ComR. The ComR/XIP complex induces a transcriptional cascade that results in development of the competent state. Interestingly, the ComRS pathway and all known components of the competence system are conserved across all members of the Mutans, Pyogenic and Bovis groups. Our data indicate that although XIP orthologs are generally specific to each species, there is evidence of cross-talk between species and groups of streptococci, We hypothesize that interactions between ComR and XIP of different species are promiscuous. Aim 1 of this proposal seeks to define the specificity and promiscuity between the ComR and ComS proteins of multiple streptococcal species. Using an S. mutans 'test bed' strain that we developed to contain a luciferase reporter monitoring ComR activity , we will test interactions of con- and hetero-specific pairings of XIP and ComR alleles. These tests will allow us to determine whether ComR and ComS proteins from different species are able to successfully interact to induce luciferase activity. By characterizing the interactions between all  combinations of ComR and ComS proteins, we will gain evidence as to what is necessary for a successful interaction. Aim 2 of this proposal involves screening genetic libraries of ComS variants to identify peptides that inhibit signaling. We have designed a method to generate large and diverse libraries of ComS-derived peptides. Using the power of bacterial genetics, we will screen for peptide variants that block productive interactions between XIP and ComR. The identification of inhibitors will aid our abilities to define components of XIP that are critical t generate a productive signal, and will also allow us to begin developing methods to interfere with other pheromone-dependent signaling pathways in Gram-positive bacteria."
"9386479","Project Summary/Abstract: Greater Providence, Rhode Island is comprised of several urban ?core? cities of high poverty and significant pediatric asthma disparity. The RI-Asthma Integrated Response (RI-AIR) Asthma Care Implementation Program (ACIP) is a comprehensive system of identification, screening and intervention for pediatric asthma. Core components include: a 1) state of the art technology platform (the RI-AIR information data system, or RI-AIR IDS) to integrate data from LifeChart (EHR), REDCap (research data system), and KIDSNet (state-based database of child health information), 2) algorithm for stratification of asthma management services based on level of asthma control/risk, 3) multilevel school-based education (CASE) to family/child/school system for children whose asthma is not well-controlled, 4) intensive home-based intervention (HARP) for children with poorly controlled asthma, and 5) enhanced coordination between caregiver, school nurse, and health care provider to promote integration across sectors of care. The first aim of the proposed work is to evaluate the effectiveness of the RI-AIR ACIP using a randomized, stepped wedge design. During Years 2-4, we will provide our intervention sequentially to sixteen high-risk communities involving approximately 1500 urban, ethnically diverse children (aged 2-12) with asthma and their families. We will evaluate both individual-level (e.g., asthma control) and community-specific outcomes (i.e., rates of ED a multi-level process evaluation of the RI-AIR ACIP during implementation (Years 2-5). We will assess penetration within identified communities and school districts, and evaluate characteristics of families that accept and complete the intervention vs. those who do not. We will determine fidelity of the RI-AIR IDS technology platform in assigning interventions according to asthma control/risk, and treatment fidelity and dose delivered of the HARP and CASE programs. We will use focus groups and provider surveys to determine facilitators of and barriers to visits) for children with asthma. The second aim of this application involves conducting effective implementation. The third aim involves conducting a mixed-methods evaluation of the sustainability of the RI-AIR ACIP, with ongoing input from our community stakeholders during Years 5-6. We define sustainability as continued capacity, continued activities, and continued benefits. We expect over 1 year, participants receiving the RI-AIR ACIP will have improved asthma control and fewer symptom free days relative to baseline. We expect over 1 year, relative to baseline, caregivers will have improved asthma knowledge, self-efficacy, asthma QOL, and indicators of effective disease management. We expect over 1 year, communities receiving the RI-AIR ACIP will have reduced ED visits and hospitalizations relative to their baseline year, and relative to targeted communities that have not yet received RI-AIR. We plan to demonstrate that RI-AIR ACIP is a replicable, evidence-based and cost-saving model that improves asthma outcomes for children at most risk, and can be disseminated to other urban communities to address asthma disparities."
"9319179","Overview and Response to Previous Review The Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University (Lurie Cancer Center) is dedicated to the conduct of innovative, translational clinical research. Novel investigator-initiated clinical trials (IITs) are a key element ofthe Lurie Cancer Center clinical research program and are of highest priority. In this competitive granting environment, funding for such studies is often either unavailable or only partially available. While industry sponsors are an important source of funds for such trials, the start-up process with our industry partners can be lengthy. The work of the Operational Efficiency Working Group (OEWG) has made it clear that rapid activation and enrollment to trials is vital. As such, the Lurie Cancer Center is committed to facilitating local, IITs through the CCSG mechanism of Protocol Specific Research Support (PSRS).      PSRS funding is competitive in nature and supports protocol coordination and data management for early phase research trials. The goal of such support is to allow for the rapid development and completion of novel, translational hypothesis-driven trials that show promise for advancement to later phase clinical research deserving of independent funding. IITs are those institutional trials that are conceived of and written by Lurie Cancer Center investigators, and fall under the purview ofthe Lurie Cancer Center for ensuring appropriate conduct ofthe trial. Since the last competing application, the Lurie Cancer Center has provided support to 21 trials developed by Lurie Cancer Center members. The funding request for PSRS in this competing application consists of one Study Coordinator and one Data Manager."
"9353393","Abstract One important yet understudied aspect in nanomaterial applications is the cell biology of nanomaterial transport into cells and through tissues. To overcome the cell membranes and reach their sites of action within, nanomaterials are often complexed with targeting ligands, such as cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), to engage with cell surface receptors. The receptor-mediated cell entry is also advantageous in concentrating more nanomaterials into certain cell or tissue types (e.g. tumors). However, the cellular machineries that mediate and/or regulate the cargo transport after receptor binding remain to be further elucidated. In this proposal, I aim to decode the cellular machinery of one such cell entry pathway, macropinocytosis (MP).  MP has relatively large endocytic vacuoles (>200 nm in diameter) and thus can more readily engulf cargo as large as nanoparticles. However, MP pathway, especially receptor-mediated ones, has remained elusive due to the lack of specific tracers. Recent studies on CPPs, including ours, have shed new light in this problem by discovering two novel receptor-mediated MP processes, which are initiated by peptide ligation with either heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans or another cell surface protein, neuropilin-1 (NRP1). We further showed that NRP1 and HS pathways are two functionally distinct subtypes of receptor-mediated MP, and generated peptide tools to exclusively trace one or the other of these two pathways. In the Aim 1, I will perform a genome-wide RNAi screening to identify genes and signaling cascades that play essential roles in initiating and regulating receptor-mediated MP. Silver-based nanoparticles coated with NRP1- or HS-binding peptides will be used to probe NRP1 and HS pathways simultaneously. In the Aim 2, I will determine the regulation of NRP1- and HS-mediated nanomaterial delivery by a variety of Ras oncogenes, which are among the most commonly mutated genes in human cancers. My proposed studies hold great potential for unveiling important cellular machineries for nanomaterial transport, boosting the efficiency of intracellular delivery, and opening the door for personalized nanomaterial delivery and even nanomedicine."
"9315621","The objectives of the BCM IDDRC Neurobehavioral Core are three-fold. The first is to provide training in the  rigorous performance of mouse behavioral assays. The second goal is to provide priority access to the  Neurobehavioral Core facilities for BCM IDDRC investigators interested in identifying and characterizing  behavioral abnormalities in mice carrying mutations relevant to IDD. BCM IDDRC investigators will have two  options available to them for the behavioral analyses of their mutant mice. Investigators will be able to either  test their own mice, or they will be able to utilize core services to perform behavioral analyses for them on a  collaborative basis with Dr. Paylor's group for either mutant mice or newly developed mutant rats (1). This  latter strategy is referred to as a collaborative core service. The third objective of the Neurobehavioral Core is  to provide training in experimental design and statistical analyses that is customized for the mutant mouse  behavioral analyses.  While the ability of laboratories to use genetic and molecular techniques for generating mutant mouse models  of intellectual disabilities has become more routine, the ability to perform comprehensive analyses of the  behavioral responses of these mutant mice is still expensive, requires numerous pieces of specialized  equipment and specially designed laboratory space. Perhaps most significant, appropriate training in the  design of studies and analysis of the resultant data (along with use of the equipment) is necessary to generate  high quality and reproducible results. It is the goal of the Neurobehavioral Core to provide access to state of  the art facilities that are equipped with specialized equipment for behavioral studies. It also provides rigorous  training to ensure successful analysis of mutant mice generated by BCM IDDRC investigators. In addition, a  collaborative service is available to those BCM IDDRC investigators interested in having the testing performed  for them in collaboration with Dr. Paylor. The collaborative model applies, in particular, to the newly developed  rat genetic models that are already being analyzed and are likely to be advanced in the coming years.  The BCM IDDRC Neurobehavioral Core will provide BCM IDDRC investigators with a battery of assays that  will offer initial insight into the behavioral consequences of specific mutations. In addition, the Neurobehavioral  Core will also provide access and training on the use of additional behavioral assays that will allow a BCM  IDDRC investigator to perform critical secondary or follow-up studies important to better understand the nature  of any behavioral abnormality detected with a primary behavioral test battery.  The Neurobehavioral Core of the BCM IDDRC is well established in studying the behavioral responses of  mutant mice. The Core has been in operation for more than 15 years, since the original recruitment of Dr.  Paylor. Dr. Paylor was involved in the initial studies of behavioral effects in a knockout mouse model in 1991,  and has since evaluated the behavioral effects of over 200 different mutations in lines of mice. Most recently,  he has characterized 7 mutations resulting in gene knockouts in rats, which are now possible with the use of  TALEN and CRISPR methods for generating genetic lesions. Shortly after joining BCM, Dr. Paylor became the  Director for the BCM IDDRC Neurobehavioral Core. His laboratory developed and utilizes a comprehensive set  of behavioral assays to evaluate a wide range of responses in mutant mice and his skills and experience have  been translated to the Neurobehavioral Core. Dr. Corinne Spencer is the Co-Director for the BCM IDDRC  Neurobehavioral Core. She joined the Neurobehavioral Core approximately 8 years ago and has quickly  become a major strength of the Core by providing management of the day-to-day operation of the Core,  training investigators on various items of equipment, the development and validation of new testing assays,  and training users in best practices for rigorous and reproducible behavioral studies in the mouse.  Users of BCM IDDRC Neurobehavioral Core have access to a wide array of behavioral assays (see below) to  assess numerous domains of CNS function. The Core has been incredibly successful during the previous  funding period as measured by the number of users, hours of use, and publications by a variety of users.  Moreover, the Core continues to expand its ability to assess behavioral responses of mutant mice and now  rats, responding to increasing needs and desires of BCM IDDRC investigators."
"9371401","a. Project summary/abstract: Sarcopenia is the age-related loss in skeletal muscle mass and strength; it leads to a host of co-morbidities including loss of physical function and overall resilience. One such perturbation in persons with sarcopenia is the diminished ability to regenerate muscle after injury. Muscle stem cells, referred to as satellite cells, are required to activate, proliferate and differentiate to regenerate muscle and restore physical function. Aged satellite cells are slower to activate upon injury; susceptible to apoptosis; and less efficient in repairing injured muscle. The AMPK/ULK1/p27Kip1 pathway appears critical for successful transition from quiescence to entry into the cell cycle. Our preliminary data identify perturbations in the AMPK/ULK1/p27Kip1 pathway with advanced age. This award period will investigate the role of the AMPK/ULK1/p27Kip1 pathway in the phenotype of satellite cell aging in both human and mouse models. In Aim1, we will test the hypothesis that activation of AMPK and its downstream targets ULK1 and p27Kip1 regulate the autophagy/apoptosis decision in aged satellite cells. We will use molecular assays to rescue the functional loss of this pathway in aged cells and return proliferative capacity. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that exercise, a physiological inducer of AMPK and autophagy, stimulates the AMPK/ULK1/p27Kip1 pathway, thereby enhancing proliferation and metabolic function in aging murine and human satellite cells. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that AMPK/ULK1/p27Kip1 signaling will regulate the beneficial effects of caloric restriction on aged satellite cells. Together, the experiments in this proposal will test the hypothesis that the AMPK/ULK1/p27Kip1 pathway is impaired in aging satellite cells resulting in a reduction in autophagy and susceptibility to apoptosis. Key aspects of Dr. White's career enhancement will be: to learn how to coordinate clinical exercise trials; to train in methods of satellite cell isolation and metabolic analysis, especially in the context of the aging organism. The training program will entail dedicated internal and external scientific presentations; pertinent course work/workshops in stem cell biology and aging; and intensive career mentorship to ensure progress toward independence. The research and career development plan detailed in this proposal will be conducted with a team of outstanding mentors. Dr. William E. Kraus, a professor at the Duke Medical School is an established expert in clinical exercise studies and muscle/satellite cell biology; he will serve as the primary mentor. Drs. Kenneth Schmader, Deborah Muoio (Duke) and Amy Wagers (Harvard) will serve as co-mentors; they will facilitate training in aging biology, cell metabolism and aging stem cell biology, respectively. The environment at the Duke School of Medicine is ideal for the research and training activities outlined in this proposal. This award will provide Dr. White with optimal training to ensure an outstanding start to his career as an independent investigator."
"9353371","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stenosis at the graft-vein anastomosis due to neointimal hyperplasia (NH) is the predominant cause of failure of arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) used for hemodialysis. Currently, there are no clinical therapies that significantly prevent or tret primary AVG NH. Shunting of arterial blood flow directly into the vein greatly alters the hemodynamics in the vein. Consequently, the fluid shear stress (FSS) and wall circumferential stress (WCS) at the NH-susceptible sites of AVGs are markedly altered. We propose that these hemodynamic changes are major contributors to NH development at the venous anastomosis of AVGs. This project aims to understand the hemodynamic regulation of NH development in AVGs. Detailed FSS and WCS in the AVG setting are not yet fully understood. We will use state-of-the-art image-based computational mechanics to characterize these stresses, and apply these data to design experiments to delineate mechanotransduction pathways. We will focus on i) the roles of two receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), as major mechanosensors in the pathogenesis of NH; and ii) the role of the transcription factor E twenty-six-1 (Ets-1) as the primary effector activated by RTK, leading to NH formation. Our proposal is based on our preliminary findings that i) VEGFR, PDGFR and Ets-1 are up-regulated in NH-susceptible sites in a porcine AVG model; ii) the RTK inhibitor sunitinib inhibits Ets-1 expression and NH development in a perfused vein organ culture model; iii) NH formation is reduced by Ets-1 inhibition in a rat model of carotid artery balloon injury and a mouse model of native arteriovenous fistula. Our hypotheses are as follows: i) The activation of RTK and Ets-1 is initiated by increases in FSS and WCS, as a result of increased blood flow and wall distention respectively, at the juxta-anastomotic vein segment of the AVG. ii) VEGFR and PDGFR are the primary mechanosensors in vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells, respectively, that mediate Ets-1 activation by FSS and WCS. iii) RTK activation followed by Ets-1 activation is a critical event in NH formation in the AVG. There are three Specific Aims: i) Understand differences in the mechanical environment between the NH- susceptible and NH-resistant sites of AVG in a porcine model. ii) Determine in a perfused vein culture model whether increased FSS or WCS enhances RTK and Ets-1 activation and subsequently NH formation. iii) Explore whether RTK and Ets-1 mediate NH formation in a porcine AVG model. Delineation of the RTK- and Ets-1-dependent mechanotransduction pathways and exploration of the roles of these pathways in NH formation is novel. The results have the potential for broad applications in other vascular pathological conditions where there is altered blood flow, including AV fistulas. The perfused organ culture system can be used to investigate pharmacological therapies under relevant flow conditions."

As industrialized farming has increased in China, the prevalence and variety of swine influenza viruses (SIVs) have increased. In this controlled, 5-yr project, we will collaborate with leading Chinese infectious disease researchers and employ a One Health approach (human, animal, and environment) to study SIV transmission in Confined Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) in mainland China. We will select CAFOs with a high prevalence of SIVs and prospectively follow the swine workers and their pigs, as well as examine the CAFO environment as a source for SIV persistence and transmission. In this collaboration, our aims are: 1) to identify and characterize enzootic and emergent SIVs, 2) to employ aerosol, fecal, environmental swabs, and water sampling to identify environmental areas with a high prevalence of SIVs, 3) to identify occupational risk factors for SIV infection, and 4) to identify serological and mucosal immunity biomarkers of protection against prevalent and emergent SIVs. This One Health approach to zoonotic influenza virus research is unique and made possible by our Chinese collaborators who have unique access to their swine production industry."
"9325296","Project Summary/Abstract Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of intractable blindness disorders that affects 1.5 million individuals worldwide. RP is characterized by a stereotypical pattern of photoreceptor death whereby rod apoptosis precedes a secondary loss of cones. Importantly, generation of therapies for RP is complicated by the fact that mutations in over 60 genes can yield the disease. However, current evidence suggests that a common pathway, regardless of the inciting mutation, leads to cone death and thus represents a potential therapeutic target. Though preservation of rods would be ideal, it is the detection of light by cones that produces the high acuity, color vision that drives the most important aspects of human behavior. Therefore, the long-term goal of this research is to characterize the cone death pathway in order to uncover gene therapy approaches to specifically enhance cone viability in all forms of RP. The current literature suggests that oxidative stress, inflammation and activation of microglia occur as a result of rod death and exacerbate photoreceptor cell injury in murine RP. Importantly, indirect evidence of these processes has been detected in the eyes of human RP patients. My central hypothesis portends that blockade of oxidative stress, inflammation, and microglial activation will preserve cone viability and vision in RP. This hypothesis will be tested through two specific aims: 1) Perform preclinical studies of rAAV vectors delivering either antioxidant or anti-inflammatory cDNAs in mouse models of autosomal dominant RP (adRP). 2) Characterize microglial and macrophage activation in mouse models of adRP. In aim 1, utilizing two mouse models of RP, I will test the efficacy of two rAAV vectors that either a) enhance the signaling of an antioxidant transcription factor known as nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), or b) simultaneously block the activity of two inflammatory signaling molecules, the Nlrp3 inflammasome and Nuclear Factor kappa B (NF?B). Expounding on preliminary studies, aim 2 will characterize the evolving phenotype of microglia and macrophage, either M1 (neuroinflammatory) or M2 (neuroprotective), in the retina as photoreceptors die during RP pathogenesis. Additionally, the M1 phenotype of microglia contributes to other central nervous system (CNS) disorders, such as stroke and Alzheimer?s disease. Thus, to better understand the protective effects of the vectors employed in specific aim 1, their ability to block the M1 phenotype will be explored both in vitro and in vivo. The research proposed in this application is significant because it would produce important information that will facilitate the generation of successful therapies that preserve cones in human patients affected by RP. Furthermore, the gene therapy approaches tested here are innovative because they deviate significantly from the current status quo of RP treatment, which involves nutritional supplementation, and would only require a single dose for the lifetime of the patient. Finally, since the retina is nervous tissue, results derived from the proposed research could be extended to other CNS diseases with an oxidative, inflammatory, or microglial component, such as seen in spinal cord injury and Parkinson?s disease."
"9490765","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The prevalence of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) is rising dramatically among both adults and youth and ENDS use is fast becoming a major public health issue. However, because of their recent emergence, researchers know little about ENDS, their use, their effects on human physiology and health, their risks and benefits, or their impact on tobacco control efforts. A common barrier to studying ENDS is the lack of data on objective, real world use of ENDS. Thus, the proposed project aims to adapt existing innovative mobile assessment tools that can be used to target critical ENDS research gaps by providing mobile sensing technology that can objectively collect precise data regarding ENDS use in real time in real world. Specifically, the proposed revision project will expand the scope of Project On Track (1R01CA190329-01A1, PI: Wetter) by extending the application of puffMarker, an existing tool that automatically detects smoking, for the assessment of ENDS use. The current project has three aims: 1) adapt and validate puffMarker to identify discrete episodes of ENDS use, 2) adapt and validate puffMarker to distinguish between cigarette smoking and ENDS use among dual users of ENDS and cigarettes, and 3) utilize the Project On Track protocol to collect real time, real world data investigating potential determinants of ENDS use among both exclusive ENDS users as well as dual users of cigarettes and ENDS. Altogether, 120 participants (30 for Aim 1, 30 for Aim 2, and 60 for Aim 3) will be enrolled. Participants recruited for Aims 1 and 2 will attend laboratory (three 2-hour sessions) and field (3 days) studies. In the laboratory sessions, participants will wear the AutoSense wireless sensors and be asked to use ENDS (Aim 1) or use ENDS and smoke a cigarette (Aim 2). Participants' ENDS and cigarette puffs will be recorded by an independent observer. In the field studies, participants will wear the AutoSense wireless sensors and be asked to use ENDS (Aim 1) or use ENDS and smoke cigarettes (Aim 2). Participants will be asked to record each instance of ENDS use or cigarette smoking on a SP. The goals of the laboratory studies are to collect data to train puffMarker to identify ENDS use and to distinguish between cigarette smoking and ENDS use. The goal of the field studies is to validate puffMarker in real-life, natural environments. Aim 3 will utilize the Project On Track protocol to collect the first real time, real world data on ENDS and dual use. Participants will be assessed for 6 days using AutoSense, EMA, and GPS to examine potential determinants of ENDS use. A validated puffMarker that detects ENDS use and distinguishes between ENDS use and smoking can enhance many areas of research inquiry on ENDS. Knowledge learned from Aim 3 will be essential for the development of comprehensive conceptual models with respect to ENDS use and smoking cessation."
"9383215","Summary The CB1 receptor (CB1R) a therapeutic target for treatment of addictions, neurodegenerative disorders and pain management, but medicinal compounds based upon the CB1R have been limited. The functions of the CB1R to regulate neuronal processes in development, retrograde signaling in neurotransmission, and cellular mechanisms of neuroprotection are critical to brain function. Endocannabinoid ligands 2-arachidonoylglycerol and anandamide are the primary neuromodulators of synaptic activity, but the full understanding of how CB1R signaling can be regulated by associated proteins in specific cell types is just beginning to be appreciated. The Scientific Premise is that CRIP1a modulation of the CB1R can be understood at the structural and functional level such that drug design based on peptide or small molecule interventions can target the CRIP1a-CB1R interaction. Our recently published studies have demonstrated that CRIP1a reduces the density of cell surface CB1R, attenuates the agonist-dependent but not the constitutive internalization processes by competing with ?-arrestins for binding to C-terminal sites, and curtails the trafficking of newly- synthesized CB1R to the cell surface after prolonged WIN55212-2 but not CP55940. Other studies demonstrated that CRIP1a has a critical role in regulating CB1R cellular signaling by altering the preference for coupling from Gi3 & Go, which require the C-terminus for activation, to Gi1 & Gi2, which do not. In unpublished studies, we have determined the high resolution structure from X-ray crystallography, and found that CRIP1a is a member of the family of carriers for myristoylated or isoprenylated proteins. Based upon this major advance in knowledge of the structure and function of CRIP1a, we hypothesize that the function of CRIP1a is to interact with the CB1R?G-protein complex in ways that can be regulated by G-alpha and/or G-gamma subunit specificity, phosphorylation, and interaction with other regulatory proteins that are known to release cargo. We propose to investigate the CB1R associated proteins in the N18TG2 neuroblastoma cell model which endogenously expresses the CB1R and its associated proteins, as well as in in vitro experiments of purified recombinant proteins and peptides derived therefrom. The aims of this project are to investigate: the interaction of CRIP1a with the CB1R; the structural and functional interaction of CRIP1 with G- proteins; and the regulation of CRIP1a function by cargo-releasing proteins and phosphorylation. The results of the proposed investigation should prove to be transformative for the field by providing evidence that CB1R and associated CRIP1a interact to direct cellular signaling pathways. From this understanding, novel peptides and small molecules could be developed as therapeutic agents for neurological diseases in which both CB1R and CRIP1a co-exist in neurons."
"9325055","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  Crosstalk between the immune and reproductive systems dramatically impacts fertility. In particular, studies have shown that a tight spatiotemporal control of leukocyte infiltration into the ovary is pivotal for successful ovulation. Once infiltrated, the leukocytes differentiate into a cohort of pro- or anti-infiammatory cells in the preovulatory ovary and play critical roles in ovulation and luteal formation. In this study, we will test the hypothesis that progesterone (P4) and prostaglandins (PG) play pivotal roles in recruiting leukocytes into the preovulatory ovary. Aim 1. To determine the mechanism(s) by which P4 and PG regulate  WBC infiltration. We will first determine the roles of P4 and PG on WBC infiltration by treating cycling adult rats with RU486, indomethacin and vehicle, and measuring the effect on the numbers, populations and localization of infiltrating WBC by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry together with a functional analysis of the expression of chemokines, cytokines, their receptors and cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) in serum, on ovarian cells and WBC by ELISA and qPCR. Aim 2. To determine whether P4 and PG regulate  WBC infiltration in primate ovary. In this Aim, we will investigate P4 and PG regulated WBC infiltration in primates. Similar to rodents, primates, including humans also require P4 and PG for normal ovulation.  Therefore, we hypothesize that P4 and PG will regulate WBC infiltration in the primate ovary. The actions of P4 and PG will be inhibited by treating primates (Cynomolgous monkeys) with trilostane (3|3HSD inhibitor; inhibits progesterone synthesis), celecoxib (selective COX-2 inhibitor) or vehicle under ovarian stimulation.  The effects on the numbers, populations and localization of WBC together with the expression of infiammatory mediators will be determined. Upon the identification of the P4- and PG-regulated WBC subtypes and infiammatory mediators in the monkey, the localization and expression patterns of their homologs will be determined in the human ovary. Aim 3. To determine the regulatory mechanism of preovulatory splenic WBC release. We will identify the trigger(s) and the mechanism of action of splenic WBC release from spleen. We hypothesize that either LH, decreased concentration of circulating WBC or angiotensin-ll (the only known trigger of splenic leukocyte release) act as the trigger. To identify the trigger(s), ovariectomized rats will be treated with candidate triggers (LH and angiotensin-ll) or artificially reduce the concentration of circulating WBC by perfusing rats with plasma. The effects on splenic WBC release will be measured by counting WBC numbers in spleen and peripheral blood."
"9512259","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal seeks funds to establish a Center for Humanized Mice Development. This new facility at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) will offer environmentally, genetically, and xenotransplantation- engineered mouse models for translational studies and drug discovery, which are the mainstream at UNMC. It is well known that often clinical studies are successful in animal models but fail at the human level. Also the focused use of micro-animals, mice in particular, makes applicability to humans problematic. In turn, we are developing a resource that will generate improved animal models to study human immunity, human-specific infections, vaccines, and human-specific drug interactions. The resources are expected to be efficiently utilized for speeding the translation of new therapeutics to patients. Our goals to improve existing strains of mice are as follows: modify mouse backgrounds for the studies of human-like adaptive immune responses to broader range of pathogens and evaluation of vaccine candidates, create strains of mice that are compatible with the function of human immune system based on human-like glycosilation patterns, modify mouse backgrounds for studies of human-like drug metabolism and drug interaction, study HIV-1-related co-infections, such as hepatitis, tuberculosis, and malaria, and lastly examine HIV-1-associated comorbidities, including end-organ diseases like HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND)."
"9366680","In our previous studies we had demonstrated that arsenic (As3+), an environmental metalloid metal, was able to induce transformation of the human bronchial epithelial cells. Additional experimental data revealed presence of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) among the transformed cells induced by As3+. Other preliminary data showed that: (i) The CSCs induced by consecutive low-concentration As3+ treatment of the human bronchial epithelial cells exhibited significant decrease of reactive oxidative species (ROS) due to severe inhibition of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS); (ii) As3+ induced JNK and STAT3 (pSTAT3S727) phosphorylation in mitochondria along with a diminish of the mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM); (iii) integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses demonstrated a higher rate of glycolysis and lower levels of mitochondrial metabolism due to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion among these As3+-induced CSCs; and (iv) a unique glycolytic feature that is different from naïve embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and cancer cells was found in these As3+-induced CSCs. Both ESCs and cancer cells direct glycolysis for lactate production. In contrast, the As3+-induced CSCs show increased conversion of the glycolytic intermediates into the subsidiary pathways for the generation of N-acetylglucosamine important for O-GlcNAcylation of the stemness genes and the S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) that contributes to DNA and histone methylation. Accordingly, the goal of this application is to determine: (1) is As3+-induced JNK-dependent pSTAT3S727 responsible for the inhibition of mitochondria; (2) if so, how this JNK-dependent pSTAT3S727 signaling pathway elicited by As3+ impairs the integrity or function of mitochondria, such as mtDNA replication, transcription, OXPHOS, etc; and (3) how the impaired function of mitochondria contributes to the generation of the CSCs induced by As3+. We hypothesize that As3+-induced JNK-dependent pSTAT3S727 signaling promotes formation of the CSCs by inhibiting mitochondrial OXPHOS and ROS generation, and the subsequent enhancement of glycolysis of the cells. To test this hypothesis, the following three specific aims are proposed: Specific Aim 1: determine how As3+ activates mitochondrial JNK that phosphorylates STAT3 S727 (pSTAT3S727) in BEAS-2B and other lung cells for the formation of CSCs. We will focus on the activation of mitochondrial-localized upstream kinases of JNK in response to As3+. The JNK dependent phosphorylation of additional mitochondrial proteins will be investigated through mitochondrial phosphoproteome; Specific aim 2: understand how As3+-induced JNK-dependent pSTAT3S727 inhibits mitochondria by addressing the role of pSTAT3S727 in mtDNA binding, its interaction with the mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), and its effects on mitochondrial ROS production, proteome and the cellular metabolomics in the As3+-treated cells and As3+-induced CSCs; Specific Aim 3: utilize our unique mouse orthotopical lung cancer model, together with clinically relevant targeting agent, to preclinically explore therapeutic potential of inhibitors of JNK, STAT3 and glycolysis in CSC-generated lung cancer model in mice. Both short- and long-term systemic regimens of JNK, STAT3 and glycolysis inhibitors will be tested. We anticipate that the results from the proposed studies will unravel importance of As3+-induced JNK-dependent pSTAT3S727 on the generation of CSCs and lead to emerging of new concepts of As3+ carcinogenesis by emphasizing the ability of As3+ in CSC induction. Moreover, we believe that the date generated from completion of this project will be of real value in defining some new and straightforward targeting points that may help accelerate their use in clinical settings.     "
"9324831","Abstract: Cytometry Facility (CF)  Cytometry is a mainstay of cancer cell biology and immunology research and, as a single-cell multiparameter  analytical tool, provides a key to deciphering cellular heterogeneity. As a preparative method, flow cytometric  sorting is rapidly becoming integrated with genomic and transcriptomic studies, permitting molecular analysis  of well-characterized single sorted cells, or phenotypically homogeneous cell populations. Both analytical and  preparative techniques are particularly well-suited to rare event problems, with cancer applications ranging  from detection of circulating and disseminated cancer cells, monitoring minimal residual disease, and defining  the role of cancer cell subsets within heterogeneous tumors. The UPCI Cytometry Facility (CF), a UPCI-  managed shared resource and located in the Hillman Cancer Center Research Pavilion, provided services to  more than 100 users over the past funding period. The CF has 5 specific aims, to: 1) Train users to operate  the Facility?s four analytical flow cytometers; 2) Perform high-speed biocontained fluorescence activated cell  sorting for investigators; 3) Perform rigorous QA/QC to ensure that the instruments in the facility are properly  calibrated on a daily basis and advising users concerning the proper settings for their experiments; 4) Advise  investigators on experimental design and data analysis and assisting in performance of complex multi-  parameter experiments; and 5) Archive all data produced by the facility. The current instrumentation at the CF  includes a Beckman-Coulter (BC) MoFlo Astrios high speed cell sorter, equipped with a BSL Class II  containment cabinet, a Becton Dickinson (BD) LSR2 Fortessa SORP 4-laser analyzer, a BC 3-laser analyzer,  2 BD Accuri 2-laser analyzers, and a ThermoFisher/Cellomics VTI100 high throughput imaging system. CF  upgrades during the past funding period were extensive, including the Astrios sorter (SIG RR032768-01), and  the Fortessa, Gallios and Accuri analyzers (all purchased with UPCI funds). CF informatics upgrades include  a gigabit link to a new high capacity file server maintained by UPMC, and iLAB, a new web-based  scheduling/billing system. The usage of the CF has remained high, with cell sorting regularly exceeding 50%  of absolute capacity and analytical cytometry exceeding 50% of business-hour capacity. Future plans of the  CF include a collaborative initiative to develop an interface between rare event sorting and imaging cytometry,  providing high resolution confocal images of sorted cells for signaling studies (nuclear translocation,  phosphorylation), and live-cell imaging of matrix experiments in which labeled cells are sorted in varying  proportions directly into culture wells and outcomes are measured by microscopic imaging. During current  project period members of all 10 UPCI Research Programs used the CF."
"9518118","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physicians in academic medicine make both direct and indirect contributions to the biomedical research enterprise. Physicians make direct contributions through their research activities; roughly half of all National Institutes of Health (NIH) research award dollars to medical schools go to physician principal investigators. Physicians also make indirect contributions through their participation in the education of students in a wide range of health professions and graduate training programs and their service as role models and mentors for these students and trainees. Thus, examining factors associated with both academic medicine career development and NIH-funding receipt, which are related but distinct outcomes, will contribute to our knowledge about factors that broadly promote physician participation in the biomedical research enterprise. Physicians from historically underrepresented minority groups ([URM ]; e.g., Black, Native American/Alaska Native, and any Hispanic) are particularly underrepresented in academic medicine. To develop strategies to increase the diversity of physicians in academic medicine, it is imperative first to identify those factors associated with academic medicine careers that can be targeted for intervention. In our first grant cycle (R01 GM085350; 8- 2008 to 7-2011), we created a database of all 1993-2000 U.S. medical school matriculants (N=129,867) and identified predictors of full-time academic medicine faculty appointment and mediators of racial/ethnic disparities in faculty appointment among graduates in this cohort (18% of white,19% of Asian/Pacific Islander, and 14% of URM graduates held full-time faculty appointments). This competitive renewal application is in response to RFA-GM-12-002. We plan to examine factors associated with 1) promotion and attrition among U.S. medical graduates with full-time academic medicine faculty positions, 2) time to promotion and attrition, and 3) among all graduates, receipt of individual NIH fellowship (F), career development (K), and research (R) grants. We will obtain follow-up data through 2012 for this cohort to update our current database, allowing for examination of factors associated with their careers as academicians and as NIH-funded researchers. Data for our outcomes of interest will be obtained from Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) Faculty Roster and NIH individual award receipt records. We will use multivariable regression models to identify factors associated with each of faculty promotion and attrition, faculty appointment among our subset of over 3,000 MD-PhDs (not examined during the first grant period because so many MD-PhDs were still in training), and individual NIH-award receipt. We will examine gender and race/ethnicity differences in time to faculty promotion and attrition using Cox proportional hazard models and Kaplan-Meier curves. The proposed study will make a substantial contribution to the literature about factors associated with the advancement of URM students interested in research along the medical-education continuum from medical school matriculation to their professional development as academicians and as NIH-funded biomedical researchers."
"9319076","PROJECT SUMMARY  While amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are Alzheimer's disease (AD) defining features, Alzheimer himself originally identified a third pathology? inflammation of the brain's glial support cells. Neuroinflammation in AD is characterized by reactive astrocytes and microglia that surround amyloid plaques and chronically secrete inflammatory innate immune cytokines. The dominant view for decades has been that all forms of inflammation damage the AD brain. Yet, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs failed to produce a positive signal for AD primary prevention. This raises a fundamental question: should we be blocking or possibly even promoting inflammation as an AD therapeutic? While the focus has mainly been on pro-inflammatory cerebral innate immunity, little attention has been paid to factors that curtail peripheral innate immune responses. The unifying theme of our work is that `rebalancing' peripheral innate immunity to homeostasis by releasing immunosuppression will limit AD progression. Strikingly, our focus on innate immunity in AD has just recently been validated by genome-wide association studies. These results have taken the field by storm; identifying clusters of AD risk alleles in core peripheral macrophage pathways.  As a key cytokine suppressor of innate immunity and inflammation, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-?) mRNA abundance is increased in AD patient brains. We hypothesize that the AD brain over- compensates to pro-inflammatory signals by producing these abnormally high levels of TGF-?. Paradoxically, this sets up early, low-level and chronic neuroinflammation that fails to support amyloid-? (A?) clearance. I and my team have shown in published and preliminary data that genetic or pharmacologic blockade of TGF-?- Smad 2/3 signaling in peripheral macrophages leads to brain entry of these cells and A? phagocytosis; sparing neurons from injury and restoring learning and memory.  To further explore this theme, we have now generated the TgF344-AD rat that recapitulates cognitive impairment and the full array of human AD pathological features: neuroinflammation, plaques, tangles, and frank neuronal loss. In AIM 1, we will use non-invasive longitudinal imaging approaches to determine whether early neuroinflammation preempts later cognitive impairment, A? deposition, structural connectivity changes and neuronal death in TgF344-AD rats. AIM 2 is designed to longitudinally evaluate if blocking peripheral innate immune TGF-? signaling licenses A? phagocytosis and mitigates AD-like changes by delivering cutting- edge nanoparticles containing small molecule TGF-?-Smad 2/3 signaling inhibitor payload to hematogenous macrophages. Finally, we will pharmacologically delete peripheral macrophages to definitively establish if they are responsible for the beneficial effects of TGF-? signaling inhibition. While AD animal model studies are typically limited by cross-sectional designs, this project will break this barrier by coupling the most advanced multimodal, longitudinal brain imaging with peripheral TGF-? signaling inhibition in the TgF344-AD rat."
"9313724","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fundamental to understanding brain function is the ability to relate the spatio-temporal firing patterns of specific neurons to their functional connectivity and determine the strength and experience-dependent regulation of those connections. Genetically-encoded optical indicators have revolutionized both endeavors, enabling action potentials and synaptic transmission to be detected, but these approaches face two major hurdles: 1) overly dense expression often makes it impossible to trace the morphology and hence connectivity of specific neurons, and 2) there has been no method to measure the probability of synaptic transmission (Pr) and quantal size of synapses in vivo, leading synaptic strength connections and the mechanism of experience- dependent change unresolved. The first problem emerges from a lack of ability to target activity indicators to specific cells that are few enough in number so that their morphology and physical connectivity could be determined in a densely packed environment, to then permit the physical picture to be related to activity and connectivity. To meet this challenge, we propose a generalizable strategy for the creation of turn-on genetically-encoded activity indicators. These indicators are rationally modified from some of the best existing indicators of neural activity and synaptic transmission. The re-engineering enables the indicators to be activated by light to provide a Golgi-like view of cell morphology and report on action potentials and synaptic input. Because the indicators are turned on by light (unlike in the random labeling methods like the Golgi stain), one can select specific target cells and functionally image densely packed cells whose processes heavily overlap while knowing which process belongs to which cell, thereby permitting a simple form of elegant connectivity mapping. The second problem emerges from the lack of a method for synapse-specific quantal analysis. Large-scale quantal resolution imaging of synaptic responses would represent a powerful addition to the experimental neuroscience toolkit to help address how dynamic changes in synaptic strength contribute to sensation, action, learning and memory. Despite a wealth of knowledge on synaptic function in reduced ex vivo preparations, such as brain slices, due to the lack of effective tools, our knowledge of synaptic function in vivo during learning and behavior is extremely limited. A new approach that overcomes this technical gap would bridge the divide between synaptic and circuit level analyses in awake, behaving animals. High signal-to-noise spine level calcium imaging in behaving animals could address this gap. To meet this challenge we propose to develop synaptically-targeted calcium indicators that enable excitatory synaptic transmission to be imaged with quantal resolution simultaneously at hundreds to thousands of connections. Because this is an imaging method, it provides synapse-specific information that one cannot readily obtain from electrophysiological recordings that lump together measurements from a large number of inputs distributed over a neuron's dendritic tree. Optical quantal analysis in behaving animals would permit direct assessment of the dynamic fluctuations in synaptic efficacy that may underlie learning. It will also open whole new avenues of research that could explore how changes in synaptic efficacy contribute to fundamental aspects of sensation, action, and higher cognitive function. The collaboration between Isacoff, Scott and Adesnik enables these new tools to be validated for in vivo applications in brain circuit analysis and behavior in three model organisms: zebrafish, fruitfly and mouse."
"9527359","Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major pathogen that causes a wide range of hospital- and communityacquired infections. The greatest obstacle to treating these infections is antibiotic resistance; the rising prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa is a major public health concern. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop novel therapeutics, which can circumvent drug resistance mechanisms applied by bacteria. Inhibrx has developed a platform based on single domain antibodies (sdAb) to enable development of novel antibiotics based on different mechanisms of action to circumvent the development of resistance. This platform is a modular format wherein multiple camelid heavy chain only antibody binding domains are joined end to end, together with an effector domain (Fc), to create multi-specific, multivalent antibodies targeting multiple epitopes. We propose to develop a therapeutic antibody against P. aeruginosa that simultaneously targets multiple secreted toxins as well as a cell-surface target, in a molecule that also contains a functional human IgG1 Fc domain. Inhibrx has used its versatile antibody format to develop two lead hexavalent, tri-specific, humanized molecules with specificity against two epitopes of a crucial component of the T3SS virulence mechanism and against an outer membrane lipoprotein that is highly conserved in all P. aeruginosa strains. These antibodies bind to all Pseudomonas strains tested and show improved efficacy in a murine infection model compared to the current leader in potential anti-Pseudomonas antibody therapeutics. We hypothesize that a therapeutic based on these antibodies will prove superior to all other existing P. aeruginosa therapeutics. Toxin blocking functionality is expected to protect immune cells recruited to the site of infection, while cell binding capability will enable opsonization of the bacteria, followed by their phagocytosis and clearance by the immune system. In this project we seek to take our candidate antibodies through Investigational New Drug (IND) enabling toxicology. In Phase I (Specific Aim #1) we propose to characterize these antibodies for their ability to bind P. aeruginosa and block T3SS dependent cytotoxicity in vitro and to compare their efficacy in in vivo models of infection, establishing one of them as a clinical candidate. Phase II of this project will focus on performing IND enabling research to facilitate taking the candidate antibody selected in Phase I to clinical trials. Pharmacokinetics (PK) will first be tested in Specific Aim #2 in human FcRn transgenic mice, as human antibodies generally have relatively short half-lives in wildtype rodents. IND-enabling multi-dose toxicity studies will then be performed in non-human primates (NHPs) to determine safety and PK of our clinical candidate. At the conclusion of this project, Inhibrx will have developed a much needed antibody therapeutic for treating MDR Pseudomonas that will be ready for IND filing. We expect this therapeutic to be highly impactful and transformative for MDR P. aeruginosa infections."
"9387090","Project Summary. This application is being submitted in response to PAR-16-355, Social Epigenomics Research Focused on Minority Health and Health Disparities (R01), and the overarching long-term goal of this research effort is to learn how to positively influence health trajectories, modify disease risk in racial/ethnic minorities, and reduce health disparities. This grant is designed to unravel the mechanisms by which social adversity confers risk for obesity in youth. Obesity was selected as the primary health outcome as it is a health measure with widening racial/ethnic disparities over the past three decades, and it is a potent predictor of a host of negative social, educational, vocational, and health outcomes later in life. In this study we propose to leverage two ongoing prenatal cohorts in Florida and North Carolina, and recruit a sample of 470 pregnant women and follow their children to 24 months of age. The sample will be enriched for adversity in pregnancy and approximately evenly divided among Caucasian, African American, and Hispanic subjects. We will assess the impact of mothers' prenatal stress on measures of DNA methylation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), which are homogenous in terms of cellular composition, and widely accepted as an optimal choice for examining in utero responses to stressors. In the epigenetic analyses we will use both targeted and big data approaches, using pyrosequencing to measure methylation of 31 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that regulate ~90 known imprinted genes, and the Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC (850k) bead chip for whole epigenome analyses. We will also assess maternal and child postnatal psychosocial stress exposure, and child growth in the first 24 months of life. Children who are overweight at any point during the first two years of life have an approximately six-fold increased risk for obesity at five years of age, and risk for chronic health problems across the lifecycle. The primary hypotheses of this study build on preliminary work from our group and include: 1) Maternal prenatal stress will be associated with increased DMRs regulating the expression of imprinted gene insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) and maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) DMR, increased methylation in Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type IV (CAMK4) gene, and methylation changes in novel CpG sites identified in the 850K analyses; 2) DNA methylation profile changes associated with prenatal stress will be related to alterations in gene expression; and 3) Methylation markers identified in Aim 1 will predict growth trajectories and measures of obesity at 24 months of age. Secondary analyses will examine several moderating factors, including: maternal Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE), maternal social supports, maternal postnatal psychosocial distress, postnatal offspring ACE, genetic variants, and relevant confounding variables. The mediating role of inflammatory markers will also be explored, and saliva DNA specimens will be collected on the full cohort at 24-months and 50 children at birth, allowing for tests of comparability of DNA methylation between HUVECs and saliva, and the stability of markers over time."
"9353595","We proposed to study at high resolution the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) locus in multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system and common cause of non- traumatic neurological disability in young adults. Over 200 loci have been firmly associated with susceptibility. The main association signal genome-wide maps to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) gene cluster in chromosome 6p21, and explains up to 10% of the genetic variance underlying risk. This region contains ~165 genes, about half having pivotal roles in the immune system. These include the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes, which have been associated with more than 100 infectious, autoimmune and inflammatory disease phenotypes, as well as drug reactions and cancers. Despite a sustained research effort on the HLA region in MS, further studies are needed to generate unifying and testable mechanistic models connected to disease pathogenesis. By examining large and well-characterized cohorts, we aim to reveal important aspects of the contribution of immune polymorphism to both, risk and progression. Our experimental approach involves complete sequencing of the 5 Mb MHC, generating high depth coverage of exonic and intronic as well intergenic segments, thus identifying all possible variants associated with the phenotypes, and distinguishing otherwise identical classical HLA alleles that differ in noncoding regions. In Specific Aim 1 we will sequence the MHC in 2,000 MS cases and 2,000 controls representing European, and African ancestries for a comprehensive analysis of sequence and structure variation. In Specific Aim 2 we will implement a systems-level pathway analysis pipeline, leveraging large open access databases to allow the identification of MHC variants with regulatory potential. Finally, in Specific Aim 3 we will employ genomic editing technologies to setup a robust cellular platform with the capability to efficiently screen the identified candidate variants, prioritizing on regulation of gene expression and gene-gene interactions. Full description of MHC variation in informative, poly-ancestral MS datasets, coupled with state-of the art-bioinformatics and hypothesis driven molecular approaches promises to yield novel insights into the genetic underpinnings of disease susceptibility."
"9352508","Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic autoimmune disease resulting in loss of pancreatic ß-cells and insulin secretion. Attempts to suppress autoimmunity and preserve ß-cells have returned modest clinical efficacy, both in magnitude and duration. Many trials involved generalized immunosuppression and/or depletion of various immune cell types, or short course therapies, which may not afford sustained benefit given the chronic nature of islet autoimmunity; yet chronic immunosuppression is limited by safety concerns. There is a need for therapies that afford immunomodulation and can be given chronically with high margins of safety to treat islet autoimmunity. It is important to develop therapies with antigen specificity, for enhanced safety, potency and disease relevance. The cytokine Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is essential for effector T cell responses, but also for regulatory T (Treg) cells that are key to self-tolerance. Clinical trials with low-dose IL-2 conducted in several immune-mediated diseases report significant clinical benefit associated with enhanced Treg function, with an excellent safety profile. We have shown that human CD4 Treg cells have heightened sensitivity to low-dose IL- 2 compared to effector T cells (Teff), in vitro, and uncovered some of the mechanisms by which IL-2 could promote Treg function and immune regulation when given at low doses to patients with T1D, as observed in the first T1D trial, which was not designed to did not test effects on insulin secretion. We now propose a multicenter clinical trial to investigate low-dose IL-2 as a therapeutic agent in T1D and its mechanisms of action. We will enroll 12-21 year-old patients with established T1D (4-12 months duration); most patients meet C-peptide eligibility criteria for at least 2 years following diagnosis and demonstrating benefit in this population would impact the field by expanding the therapeutic window. Participants will be randomized to placebo for 2 years, or low-dose IL-2 therapy for either 1 or 2 years. The primary hypothesis is that low-dose IL-2 therapy will be safe, will preserve insulin secretion and increase Treg proportions. This trial will exploit the fact that T1D requires multiple insulin injections daily and thus patients immunize themselves with a key T1D autoantigen. We hypothesize that insulin therapy synergizes with low-dose IL-2 by inducing insulin-specific Treg cells. This result would support exploiting IL-2 in combination with antigen(s) to promote antigen/disease specific immune regulation in autoimmune disease. The study has three specific aims: Aim 1: To determine the efficacy and safety of low-dose IL-2 therapy in patients with established T1D. The primary clinical and mechanistic objectives are the efficacy of low-dose IL-2 in preserving insulin secretion and improving proportions of Treg cells, compared to placebo. Aim 2: To identify mechanisms and biomarkers of response in T1D patients undergoing low-dose IL-2 therapy through the study of immune homeostasis, IL-2R signaling, gene expression, and T cell metabolism. Aim 3. To evaluate the ability of low-dose IL-2 therapy to reduce autoreactive CD4 and CD8 T cells and increase insulin-specific Tregs. These data will be related to effects of the therapy on serum cytokine levels and the TCR repertoires."
"9382770","CD1d-restricted NKT cells with invariant TCR? chains (iNKT cells) are a unique and conserved component of the mammalian immune system. Studies in mice have shown dramatic in vivo effects of iNKT cell activators, such as the CD1d-presented glycolipid antigen ?-galactosylceramide (?GalCer), in a wide variety of animal models, but despite remarkable therapeutic effects with iNKT cell activators in murine models of cancer and other diseases, this area has been slow to progress to more advanced clinical development. This application addresses issues that are likely to be major limitations in advancing iNKT cell-based therapeutics, and seeks to provide practical solutions to these impediments. We hypothesize that attempts to move iNKT cell therapeutics into the clinic for applications such as cancer immunotherapy or as vaccine adjuvants have been slowed by three specific issues, all of which will be directly addressed by the current proposal. The first is the suboptimal design of synthetic iNKT cell activators, which we will overcome using recent discoveries from our work on the structure-activity relationship of ?GalCer analogues. The second issue is the tendency of iNKT cell agonists to induce deletion and hypo-responsiveness of the responding cells (?anergy?), making them at best ?single shot? therapeutics. We will use recently developed novel glycolipid delivery methods to overcome this limitation. We also propose studies based on recent gene expression profiling in iNKT cells to identify the cell surface receptors that control post-activation anergy, which will provide mechanistic insights into the anergic response and strategies to overcome it. A third issue addressed by the proposal relates to the inadequacy of standard mouse models for development of potential iNKT cell therapeutics, for which we will implement human CD1d knock-in mice as the first practical, humanized model for in vivo evaluation of iNKT cell-based immunotherapies. Overall, this competing renewal application proposes innovative solutions to major impediments in the ongoing effort to harness the potential of iNKT cell-based therapeutics. Successful completion of the aims of the proposal should advance our understanding of iNKT cell biology, while also helping to drive progress in the area of cancer immunotherapy."

His long-term career goal is to lead a program of biobehavioral research to test how behaviors and genes combine to affect body composition and the development of obesity during adolescence. His work will help to inform childhood obesity prevention and promote healthy bone development. This career development award will provide him with training in sleep and he will develop expert knowledge on the integrated relationships between sleep, dietary intakes and physical activity in childhood. He will also receive training on the genetics of childhood obesity and bone mass, and this will enable him to lead gene-environment interaction studies. Finally, he will receive expert training on the methodologies used to measure body composition in the lab setting so that he can specifically estimate adiposity and bone mass in his research studies. His development in these areas will be achieved through a series of training activities and a research project, guided by an interdisciplinary team of senior scientists with expertise in sleep, genetics, nutrition, physicl activity, and body composition. He will complete coursework and attend seminars at the University of Pennsylvania that will cover sleep, nutrition, and obesity research. He will collaborate with members of his mentoring team to complete laboratory rotations and independent studies on sleep measurement, body composition measurement, and the genetics of body composition. He will complete short courses that cover physical activity research and longitudinal data analysis, and he will attend annual scientific meetings hosted by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (SLEEP), the American Heart Association (Epidemiology and Prevention/Lifestyle and Cardiometabolic Health [EPI/Lifestyle]), and the Obesity Society (Obesity Week). He will lead a research project that will use resources at the University of Pennsylvania, Perelman School of Medicine and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). The research project aims to investigate the association between sleep, adolescent obesity and energy intake and physical activity. He will recruit a sample of 100 healthy adolescents aged 13 to 14 (8th grade) at baseline and will re-assess these adolescents at 1-year follow-up (9th grade. The participants have already been genotyped for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), representing obesity susceptibility loci, at the Center for Applied Genomics at CHOP. At both time points, he will provide each participant with two accelerometers; one will be worn for 24 hours per day for 2-weeks on the wrist to estimate total sleep time (TST). The second will be worn on the hip during waking hours for 2-weeks to estimate time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary behavior (SB). During the 2-week wear periods trained Nutrition Core staff will call each participant on three occasions to record foods consumed in the past 24 hours; these data will be used to estimate energy intakes. Each participant will visit the CTRC Nutrition Core to have his or her fat mass estimated by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). He hypothesizes that: 1) declines in TST will be associated with higher fat mass, 2) declines in TST will be associated with increased energy intake, and 3) declines in TST will be associated with less time spent in MVPA and more time spent in SB. This longitudinal study will provide the experience and necessary pilot and feasibility data to support a larger R01 study of the effects of sleep, diet and physical activity on adiposity changes during adolescence."
"9403144","Chorioamnionitis (CAM), or inflammation of the fetal membranes, is often the result of ascending bacterial infection and is a major contributor to premature birth, neonatal sepsis, and long-term disability and morbidity in babies. Unfortunately, CAM is often asymptomatic and not easily diagnosed in time to prevent maternal and fetal adverse outcomes. Solving this problem is hamstrung by a limited understanding of early steps in disease pathogenesis. Despite its relatively simple structure, surprisingly little is known about how fetal membranes participate in immune defense against potential pathogens. Defining the cellular and molecular basis of innate immunity within the membranes promises to reveal actionable, host-based targets for diagnosis, prevention and therapy against CAM. Our objective is to define specific contributions of macrophages to fetal membrane immunology in the context of bacterial CAM caused by the common pathogen Group B Streptococcus (GBS). Macrophages in the gravid uterus balance host defense activities with pregnancy-specific actions such as promoting placental development and governing immune tolerance between mother and fetus. It is fascinating that both maternal (decidual) and fetal (placental) macrophages are present at the maternal-fetal interface, yet their specific roles in innate immunity are unknown. We hypothesize (1) that maternal and fetal macrophages make unique contributions both to host defense and tissue inflammatory responses during bacterial infection and (2) that the common CAM pathogen, GBS, evades innate immunity by resisting the oxidative stress within these macrophages. We will test this hypothesis through three Aims. In Aim 1 we will determine the extent to which maternal and fetal macrophages contribute to the natural history of CAM in vivo using a model of ascending GBS infection. In Aim 2 we will identify the extent to which GBS survival within macrophages depends upon the NADH peroxidase (npx) or other genotype-specific intracellular survival defenses. Mutagenesis studies will be conducted to better understand the impact of npx and other GBS mutations on survivability and disease in vivo, and to classify bacterial and host genes important for the process using RNA sequencing. Additional genotypes will be examined for variation in the ability to survive inside decidual and placental macrophages and persist in the presence of antibiotics commonly used to treat GBS infections. Lastly, in Aim 3 we will define the paracrine contribution of macrophages within the human fetal membrane during infection. For this aim, we will take a deconstructive approach, populating a microfluidic, instrumented fetal membrane-on-chip with decidual or placental macrophages, decidual stromal cells, trophoblasts and amnion epithelial cells. We will test the sub-hypothesis that distinct macrophage types contribute uniquely to inflammatory quiescence within uninfected membranes and amplify proinflammatory responses upon microbial threat in specific manners. These studies will shed new light on reproductive immunology and accelerate the development of new diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic interventions that support healthy pregnancies."
"9324967","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate is an accomplished gastroenterology fellow with formal training in epidemiological methods and a commitment to a career in clinical and translational research in the study of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The candidate's long-term career goal is to become an independently funded physician investigator, devoting more than 75% of his time to establish and maintain a clinical research program in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The candidate's short-term career goals are to 1) build large analytic datasets based upon administrative data collected in registries; 2) design and interpret genetic data, including application of gene-environment interaction methodology; 3) oversee the collection of new bio specimens and understand the complexities of efficient bio banking; 4) acquire skills in the analysis and interpretation of high dimensional data sets, including genetic polymorphisms and gut micro biome sequence data; 5) produce the data and publications necessary for a successful R01 application. This application outlines the institutional commitment, research plan, career development activities and key mentors involved to ensure the candidate accomplishes these goals. In prior work, the candidate has demonstrated that use of oral contraceptives (OC) is associated with an increased risk of developing CD. This finding, in agreement with several other prior studies, has convincingly established OC as an etiologic risk factor for CD. Nonetheless, data regarding an influence of OC on CD progression and potential biological mechanisms underlying associations with CD are lacking. In this proposal, the candidate seeks to fill this knowledge gap through a comprehensive examination of the complex interaction between OC, sex steroid biomarkers, genetic risk loci, and alterations in the intestinal microbial environment in the etiology and progression of CD. The specific goals of this study are to 1) estimate the relative and population attributable risk associated with OC of developing CD or developing CD-related complications among patients with CD using comprehensive Swedish nationwide registries; 2) evaluate the interaction between OC and CD risk loci on incident CD and evaluate the relationship between prediagnostic plasma sex steroid hormones on risk of CD using two large, well-characterized cohorts which have provided detailed and updated lifestyle data for over 30 years; 3) evaluate the effect of OC use on gut microbial composition and mucosal inflammation within clinic-based patient cohorts. As an integral part of this proposal, the candidate's career development will be complemented by participation in advanced coursework and research seminars to develop expertise in genetic epidemiology, plasma biomarker, and micro biome data analysis. A formal mentorship committee and advisory team, consisting of multidisciplinary experts in epidemiology, genetics, genetic epidemiology, and the micro biome will provide supervision, guidance, and assistance for the candidate to achieve his goals. The research environment, which includes the MGH Crohn's and Colitis Center, the NIH-supported Center for the Study of IBD, the Channing Laboratory of chronic disease epidemiology, the Harvard School of Public Health, and the Karolinska Institute, will provide a rich, collaborative, and intellectually stimulating atmosphereto ensure the candidate's success. Through this award, the candidate will emerge as an independent clinical investigator by contributing to our understanding of the role of OC in the etiopathogenesis of CD through a series of studies that bridge epidemiologic correlation with disease causation."
"9321420","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor in adults and one of the most lethal of all cancers, with a median patient survival of 12-15 months despite advanced treatment. There is no effective therapeutic strategy to antagonize GBM malignant growth. Therefore, identification of new molecular targets and development of innovative treatment strategies are desperately needed. EGFR/PI3K/Akt signaling has been shown to be activated in around 88% of GBM patients, which suggests that it could be a promising therapeutic strategy to target this pathway to treat GBM. Unfortunately, targeting EGFR, PI3K and mTOR using its small molecular inhibitors has shown no or very short-term response. To significantly improve the efficacy of GBM treatment, it is essential to better understand the underlying molecular mechanisms of GBM pathogenesis and its biologic characteristics. Metabolism reprogramming has been shown to coordinate with oncogenic growth signaling and promote rapid tumor growth. However, the detailed mechanisms of metabolic changes and their molecular links with oncogenic signaling are still unclear. Our previous study was the first to demonstrate that fatty acid synthesis is highly elevated in GBM and is upregulated by EGFR/PI3K/Akt signaling through activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), a master lipogenesis transcriptional factor. In addition to fatty acid cholesterol is also important for cells as it is an essential component of cell membranes. However, whether cholesterol metabolism is altered in cancers remains unknown. Our preliminary data shows that cholesteryl esters and cholesterol-rich low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR) are both highly elevated in GBM cell lines and patient tissues, particularly in EGFRvIII- expressing cells. Our data further demonstrate that GBM cell growth is highly dependent on LDL uptake, and activating nuclear receptor liver X receptor (LXR) significantly inhibits GBM cell growth. The hypothesis of this application is that GBM cells are dependent on cholesterol uptake for rapid growth, and its high levels are maintained by EGFR/PI3K/Akt signaling through upregulation of the SREBP-1/LDLR pathway to promote LDL uptake. We predict that LDLR and LXR are novel molecular targets in GBM and depriving cells of cholesterol alone or in combination with inhibition of fatty acid synthesis will significantly inhiit GBM growth. In this study, we aim to identify a novel therapeutically targetable tumor survival pathway, and investigate the efficacy of targeting LDLR or activating LXR by its synthetic agonists GW3965 and T9091317, separately or in combination with the FASN inhibitor C75 on GBM xenograft tumor growth. We will: 1) determine the molecular mechanism by which EGFR/PI3K signaling upregulates LDLR and LDL uptake, and test atorvastatin treatment in GBM cells in Aim 1; 2) investigate the role of LDLR on GBM tumor growth in Aim 2; 3) determine the mechanism and efficacy of activating LXR by GW3965, T9091317 alone or in combination with FASN inhibitor C75 on GBM tumor growth, and evaluate the translational potential of these drugs to treat GBM in Aim 3."

"9328005","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Core 1 (Microfabication) The Microfabrication Core is a virtual infrastructure built upon the established microfabrication capacities in the laboratories of Drs. Fan and Levchenko, which have been geared toward innovative microfluidics and bioMEMS platforms for biomolecular and phenotypic analyses of cancer cells. It is also supported by the shared facility at Yale University West Campus. Specifically, the Core will support both Research Projects by fabricating and supplying nano-topographic patterned array substrata and microchip platforms as well as the assay services performed with them to i) measure single cancer cell migration and invasiveness in response to combination of external cues and genetic alterations to identify the molecular networks responsible for the P-A phenotypic switch, and ii) measure a panel of paracrine signals mediating heterotypic cell-cell communication that drive non-cell-autonomous mechanisms of invasive spread. In parallel, the Core will be a technology innovation center will develop novel technology platforms to enable new opportunities for scientific discoveries that cannot be achieved using the existing tools. Thus, the Core will be built upon substantial research in engineering innovation and represent an important component of the Yale's Cancer Systems Biology Center. Integration of the Core and the Research Projects will be performed according to the following research plan. First, fabrication of the nano-tographic patterned array substrata for directed cell migration measurement. Second, developing a microfluidic cell invasiveness assay chip via integrating the aforementioned substrata with microfluidic control of the cell media. This platform will be used to analyze melanoma and glioblastoma cell motility and quantify phenotypic heterogeneity (Project 1), and measure the influence of stromal cells and paracrine factors secreted therefrom (Project 2) on cancer cell invasiveness via further integration with the dual channel microfluidic co-culture device. Third, developing a microfluidic cell-cell communication assay microchip. This platform will be used to analyze how cell-cell communication alters the fate of cancer cells in a non-autonomous fashion (Project 2). The Core 1 will also function as a base to bridge engineering and biology to train cross-disciplinary cancer researchers and outreach activities.

"9260642","Project Summary Understanding how the CD4 T cells that harbor HIV in vivo differ from those that do not may spur the development of prophylactic or therapeutic antiviral strategies. Unfortunately, due to the complexity of HIV-infected CD4 T cell populations and to key technical obstacles, the detection and manipulation of these rare cells in blood and lymphoid tissue samples from HIV-positive individuals has previously been infeasible. We have therefore developed a novel technology termed PCR-activated cell sorting (PACS) that allows identification and manipulation of individual CD4 T cells in microfluidically-generated water-in-oil emulsions by the presence of intracellular HIV genomic DNA. In the proposed investigations, we will use this technology to sort single HIV-infected CD4 T cells from blood and lymphoid tissue of HIV-positive individuals for gene expression profiling by whole transcriptome deep sequencing. This comprehensive approach will allow discovery of novel markers of HIV-infected CD4 T cell in vivo, which will then be validated in follow-up tissue staining and cell sorting studies. Importantly, access to well-characterized NIH Clinical Center cohorts of HIV- positive study participants with spontaneous control of the virus, with uncontrolled infection, and with virus suppression on antiretroviral therapy (ART) will allow targeted study of these distinct clinical subgroups. Comparing results from these subgroups will allow differences between HIV infected CD4 T cells under differing degrees of natural or treatment-induced virologic suppression to be understood. By thus elucidating the determinants of HIV target cell selection and persistence in vivo, these studies may lead to the development of novel HIV cure strategies."
"9336820","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The aim of this career development proposal is to explore neuroimaging correlates of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) on the Default Network (DN), as a vehicle to train the candidate for a career in PTSD neuroimaging research. The candidate will use three separate and complementary means to examine the effects of PTSD on the DN, by evaluating changes in resting state functional connectivity, task-induced deactivations, and white matter integrity utilizing diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in a group of subjects with the disorder for comparison with an appropriate control group. The candidate is guided by previous research in these areas in civilian PTSD; given the potential of this research it is critical to investigate these findingsin Veteran populations.  The candidate's long-term career goal is to investigate the DN as a potential prognostic tool for PTSD: to predict those at risk for developing PTSD after trauma exposure and develop metrics to measure, or predict, treatment response. The candidate's immediate career goals are to use this proposal to learn the research skills needed to pursue an independent career in clinically informed neuroimaging in Veterans. The central hypothesis of this career award is that PTSD adversely affects the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), a node of the DN, which in turn leads to network-level effects that contribute to the clinical symptoms of PTSD.  The candidate will evaluate this hypothesis using three Specific Aims; that Veterans with combat associated PTSD have 1) decreased resting state functional DN connectivity, 2) increased magnitude of task-associated DN deactivations, and 3) decreased integrity of white matter tracts connecting DN regions, compared to Veterans without PTSD.  To accomplish these aims, the candidate will pursue a careful training plan under the expert tutelage of a transdisciplinary mentoring team. This approach is innovative, as it explores different yet complementary means to evaluate the DN, and is significant because it may lead to identification of possible biomarkers of PTSD with many potential applications to improve our Veterans' health. The focused impact of this proposal is that it pursues research in the service of the candidate's training, to bring a young investigator to the VA for a career in independently funded PTSD neuroimaging research."
"9516051","We aim to revolutionize the traditional newborn screening paradigm by developing a point-of-care digital microfluidic platform for biochemical screening of fatty acid oxidation disorders (FAOs) and galactosemia. These disorders are inborn errors of metabolism that have profound neurological and hypoglycemic effects if not detected early. Although these disorders are included in traditional newborn screening with a multi-day turnaround, infants still die due to the ?deadly delays? inherent to the system of transporting dried blood spots to a central laboratory. Confirmation of a diagnosis of common FAOs by enzymatic or molecular analysis can take months, leaving families in a stressful position of uncertainty. Point-of-care testing by enzyme activity is critical to address these issues. As of yet there is not a single point-of-care newborn screening technology available for biochemical screening or diagnostic confirmation. Baebies? digital microfluidic platform is a recognized innovative, affordable, automated microdroplet-based liquid handling system that can be configured to address this challenge. The digital microfluidic technology enables miniaturization of assays and significantly reduces reagent and sample volumes while providing timely data to guide clinical intervention. Baebies is guided by a vision that every newborn deserves a healthy start. Baebies? current product is for a laboratory setting and has been in use for over 2 years in the state of Missouri for the first ever newborn screening pilot study of multiple lysosomal storage disorders in the United States. The proposed point-of-birth (POB) newborn screening platform utilizes the same underlying digital microfluidic technology and aims for a time-to-result of 15 minutes so that prompt treatment through a controlled feeding schedule can be initiated. The project objective is to demonstrate technical feasibility of using digital microfluidics to detect medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency, very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency and galactosemia in whole blood samples for improved newborn screening at the point-of-birth. The Phase I specific aims include biochemistry development of the assays on whole blood samples, integration and analytical validation of the multiplexed panel, and preliminary method comparison using blood samples from newborns at the University of Pittsburgh. In Phase II, we will complete hardware development of the point-ofbirth platform, complete development of a self-contained cartridge, and perform a pilot study for method comparison. The point-of-birth platform will have the ability to expand to other time-critical conditions in the future."

"9455116","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Knowledge of the neurons with which the brain detects and responds to changes in CO2/pH (central chemosensitivity) is critical to understanding both homeostatic regulation and the nature of diseases resulting from failures in chemosensitivity, such as sleep apnea, Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome and the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. Medullary raphe neurons synthesizing the neurotransmitter serotonin (5HT) or ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA) are proposed as 1st order chemosensory neurons. Unknown, however, are the critical potential reciprocal interactions between 1st order neurons, and the role of 2nd order chemosensory neurons that may integrate, amplify and coordinate activities of 1st order neurons, to modulate homeostatic reflex responses to chemosensory stimuli. We postulate that 1st order raphé 5HT and GABA chemosensory neurons interact between themselves and drive a specific population of 2nd order neurons. Together, these form a local raphé chemosensory amplifier (RCA) network. Our overarching hypothesis is that 1st order sensory neurons of the medullary raphé are integrated by reciprocal interactions and 2nd order neurons to form a local coordinated network. We have two aims. Specific Aim 1: Intrinsic sensitivity of raphé 5HT and GABA neurons is shaped by the RCA network. Specific Aim 2: RCAI integrate and amplify inputs from 1st order 5HT and/or GABA neurons. Proposed studies will confirm and localize, or refute the existence of critical network interactions within the raphé influencing chemo responsiveness of neurons when within an intact nervous system. Results will test the validity of the RCA model, and will suggest an organization of the raphé chemosensory system and advance the understanding of central chemoreception by contributing definitive information about the network characteristics involved in this vital process."
"9260162","Project abstract: The number of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) genes almost equals to the number of protein coding genes. However, the functions of most of lncRNA genes are unknown. Differential expression of lncRNA genes in different hematopoietic lineages implies that lncRNA genes are important regulators for hematopoiesis. One subgroup of lncRNA genes consists of antisense RNA genes that are transcribed in the opposite direction of their sense counterparts. Many genes important for hematopoiesis such as RBM15, PU.1, WT1, p53 and RUNX1 have antisense counterparts. In this proposed study, we plan to investigate the molecular details on how an antisense RNA (AS-RBM15) of RBM15 gene regulates hematopoiesis. We reported that AS-RBM15 promotes RBM15 protein translation via interaction with the 5'UTR of RBM15 mRNA. Furthermore, AS-RBM15 may promote megakaryocyte differentiation via RBM15-dependent and RBM15-independent pathways. We plan to address the hypothesis that AS-RBM15 regulates hematopoiesis via enhancing protein translation. 1) Determine how the cytoplasmic AS-RBM15 regulates RBM15 protein translation in hematopoietic cells. In this specific aim, we plan to understand how the RNA-RNA interaction involving AS-RBM15 and uORF in 5'UTR of RBM15 mRNA regulates RBM15 protein translation, and what kind of hematopoietic signals regulate AS-RBM15-mediated protein translation. 2) Determine the in vivo biological functions of mouse AS-Rbm15 in hematopoiesis. Although the primary RNA sequences between humans and mice are very different, the biological functions of AS-RBM15 genes may still be conserved. We plan to use mouse leukemia cell lines to investigate AS-Rbm15's molecular functions and to use bone marrow transplantation assays to investigate hematopoiesis in vivo. Accomplishing this proposal will provide us with new paradigms on RNA-mediated regulation, establish methods to study other antisense RNA genes and open up new avenues to understand the roles of long noncoding RNA in normal hematopoiesis."
"9411638","ABSTRACT In the twenty years since effective HIV treatments became available, the lifespan of HIV-infected adults in high- resource settings has increased to within a decade of uninfected individuals. Nevertheless, antiretroviral treatments (ART) fall short in restoring health, and if therapy is discontinued virus usually rebounds to pretreatment levels due the persistence and reactivation of proviruses. Curative therapies are being sought, including therapeutic vaccines, chemotherapies paired with stem-cell transplant, chimeric antigen receptor T cells, neutralizing and immune modulating antibodies, gene therapies, cytokines and initiation of ART during acute infection. While some of these approaches have reduced the ?reservoirs? of infectious viruses and in one case may have cured HIV infection, a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying HIV persistence is needed to develop an effective, safe and economical cure. HIV reservoirs are primarily established early in infection, and while they decay and change in composition during ART, the mechanisms that sustain reservoirs are only partially known. We hypothesize that HIV reservoirs are maintained by: (1) Integrated proviruses that modulate gene expression to promote survival of these cells, allowing infected cells to persist by proliferation or latency; (2) HIV-specific immune responses become exhausted due to dysregulation of T-regulatory cells resulting from provirus integration; and (3) Epigenetic marks repress expression of proviral DNA, allowing infected cells to persist due to ?deep? latency of proviruses. We propose studies to explore the role of these mechanisms in sustaining HIV reservoirs using specimens collected prospectively from a unique Belgian cohort of chronically infected individuals sampled during ART-suppression as well as during and after an analytical treatment interruption (ATI). Samples for this study include blood, cerebral spinal fluid, bone marrow, bronchioalveolar lavage fluid, lymph node, duodenum, ileum, and colon. The knowledge gained from the proposed studies should point to interventional strategies that could be tested and potentially contribute to the goal of developing an intervention to cure HIV infection."
"9357691","Each year, more than 40 million Americans present to US emergency departments (EDs) for evaluation after trauma exposure (TE). While the majority of these individuals recover, an important subset develops adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae (APNS). These APNS include traditionally categorized outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, minor traumatic brain injury (MTBI), and regional or widespread pain. However, these previous definitions of outcome have limited progress, and we now appreciate that the actual trajectories of APNS are multidimensional, incorporating a range of specific outcomes that may be best understood, and optimally targeted for intervention, by dividing across specific domains of functioning. This application, submitted in response to RFA-MH-16-500, proposes to identify and characterize the trajectories of the most common trauma-induced APNS within these domains of functioning using the RDoC classification system. 5,000 patients presenting to the ED after trauma will be screened, recruited, and will receive initial baseline evaluation in the ED, including blood collection and psychophysical, survey, and neurocognitive evaluation. They will be closely monitored over the next 8 weeks using innovative technologies (a wrist wearable for continuous-time monitoring of daytime physiology and sleep; a smart phone app for continuous-time monitoring of GPS and daily ?flash? surveys; weekly web-based neurocognitive tests; periodic mixed-mode surveys; serial saliva collection; deep phenotyping [blood collection, fMRI, psychophysical evaluation]) and then followed less intensively using similar procedures (including deep phenotyping) over the remainder of a 52-week follow-up period. Adaptive sampling and state-of-the-art statistical methods will be used to (1) optimize precision in characterizing RDoC construct trajectories and (2) test theoretically-guided, ?high yield? hypotheses evaluating the effects of pre-trauma, peritraumatic, and recovery-related factors on these trajectories and on multivariate RDoC construct trajectory profiles. The longitudinal schedule of rich, granular, multidimensional data collection in the study has been specifically designed to evaluate those constructs most important to post-TE outcomes and to test the proposed hypotheses. Ensemble machine learning methods will be used to develop tiered-targeted clinical decision support models to identify individuals at high risk of specific, common APNS outcomes. The close-knit ED research network that will undertake the study has a strong track record of prospective research on APNS and is ideally suited to carry out this exceedingly complex study. The study has been designed to be a resource for the entire field (for example, it has been designed and budgeted to collect and store a great many more biological samples at the NIMH Biorespository than we can analyze, for use by other investigators)."
"9353844","Project Summary This project is designed to reveal how the cancer-driver mutations found in the genes encoding central metabolic enzymes cause epigenetic consequences in the multiple types of cancers in which they are found. Work in the field indicates that mutations affecting one of these enzymes, isocitrate dehydrogenase, produce an onco-metabolite known a 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) which can inhibit enzymes that remove methyl modifications of DNA and histones. Which methylated targets play critical roles in cancers is unclear. The PI has show that the very same mutations found in human cancer, when engineered into the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae produce 2-HG. He has also found a yeast gene that encodes an enzyme that metabolizes 2- HG. Using an ingenious assay for pertubations of heterochromatin, the overproduction caused by these mutations appears to hyper-stabilize heterochromatin, not by inhibiting DNA demethylation, but by inhibiting demethylation of a specific methylated species of lysine 36 on histone H3. The proposed experiments extend these genetic inferences by direct biochemical tests. They will test whether 2-HG is affecting any of the other structures of chromatin by well- established genomic methods that they are expert in. Further aims extend their surprising discovery that 2-HG is also made by wild-type cells. By harnessing the power of systematic genetic array (SGA) technology, they will identify the natural role of 2-HG in cells by identifying all genes that, when mutant, render cells sensitive to elevated 2-HG. Yeast models for the cancer-driving alleles of succinate dehydrogenase and fumarase will be made and tested for epigenetic impacts, and if found, the mechanism of the impact will be established. Building upon success with the yeast model of isocitrate dehydrogenase mutants, the PI has completed a successful pilot screen that identified 5 genes so far that affect heterochromatin stability through effects on metabolism, and propose completing the screen with an estimated recovery or 50- 100 genes, representing a near-comprehensive set of intersections betweeen metabolism and epigenetics. The mechanism behind each perturbations's epigenetic effect will be determined."
"9208438","PROJECT 2 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Herpesvirus miRNAs target many different cellular and viral processes involved in viral immune recognition, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, cellular trafficking as well as viral latency and lytic replication. We have made significant advances elucidating functional roles for HCMV miRNAs including the identification of HCMV miRNAs that regulate HCMV IE1 as well as multiple cellular genes involved in cell cycle modulation, formation of the viral assembly complex, and TLR2 signaling. Importantly, we have observed that the HCMV miRNAs work coordinately to efficiently down-regulate individual genes and that the HCMV miRNAs target multiple individual genes within the same cellular pathways. Recently, we have determined that several HCMV miRNAs target multiple members of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) signaling pathways that are important in viral latency and hematopoiesis. We have observed that a double HCMV mutation of two of the miRNAs targeting this pathway results in an increase in viral reactivation while two other viral miRNA double mutants fail to reactivate in a human progenitor cell (HPC) culture system in vitro. Lastly, EGFR signaling has also been shown to be important in HPC hematopoiesis. We have observed that infection of HPCs with single and double HCMV miRNA mutations results in reduced levels of CFU-GM, CFU-GEMM and BFU-E colony formation as well as myelosuppression in comparison to WT HCMV, suggesting a role for the miRNAs in hematopoiesis. Therefore, we hypothesize that HCMV miRNA regulation of EGFR signaling plays a critical role in viral latency and reactivation as well as hematopoiesis. In the current proposal we will characterize the EGFR HCMV miRNA targetome and the functional relevance of the EGFR miRNA targets for viral latency and replication in CD34+ HPC in vitro. These studies will be extended in a newly developed human fetal bone, liver and thymus (BLT) NOD-scidIL2Rgc null mouse model that is able to support latent HCMV infection as well as reactivation from latency (Core A). We will determine how the HCMV miRNAs that target this pathway interphase with UL133/8 EGFR regulation in the establishment and maintenance of viral latency in Project 1. Additionally, several of the HCMV miRNAs also target genes activated by the HCMV latency gene US28 and UL7. We will examine the role that these miRNAs play in regulating US28 signaling and US28-EGFR signaling cross-talk in Project 3 and UL7 (Project 4). Lastly, we will determine the contribution of the HCMV EGFR miRNAs in hematopoiesis in comparison to results of WT HCMV in Project 5."

"9321573","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rising global prevalence of Alzheimer disease (AD) has heightened the urgency to develop effective AD therapeutics. Many lines of evidence support the hypothesis that AD pathogenesis involves dysfunctional innate immune effector cells in both the periphery and central nervous system (CNS). Innate immunity promotes tissue repair, clearance of debris, release of cytokines and chemokines which act to signal appropriate interface with adaptive immune responses. However, dysregulation of CNS innate immune cells, microglia, or of peripheral monocytes, contributes to a neurotoxic environment directly injuring synapses, creating a feed forward loop of neural injury. Recent technological advances have produced powerful tools to survey the molecular regulators of the innate immune network contributing to AD pathogenesis. MicroRNAs, a class of small non-coding RNAs, have emerged as powerful modulators of CNS and peripheral innate immunity, regulating pro-inflammatory activity, phagocytosis and contributing to mechanisms of A? clearance. MiRNA profiles are altered in brain tissue, serum and CSF of patients with AD. In particular, miR146 and miR155, proximal inflammatory modulating miRNAs, are dysregulated in AD implicating miRNAs in the inflammatory arm of AD pathogenesis. Work by our group and others have demonstrated that miR146 and miR155 participate in in the development of age-dependent chronic inflammation in vivo. These data underscore putative pathways by which AD pathogenesis is influenced by inflammatory miRNA regulatory networks. In this multi-PI application, we have designed a systems approach to investigate the role of miRNAs in CNS and circulating innate immune cell regulation in the context of AD. MicroRNA profiling, gene co-expression analysis and amyloid-? (A?) clearance studies will be performed in peripheral macrophage and microglia-like cells differentiated from individuals with early symptomatic AD and early or asymptomatic carriers of familial autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease genes (PSEN1, PSEN2 and APP). In parallel, we will employ the murine APP/PS1 and 5XFAD AD models to determine the impact of altered miR146 and miR155 expression in vivo on cognitive deficits, synapse loss, A? clearance and chronic CNS inflammation. By capturing the inflammatory miRNA landscape and inflammatory profile in patients destined to develop dementia of the Alzheimer type and modeling microRNA modulation in vivo, we aim to identify targetable pathways which leverage the bidirectional communication between CNS and peripheral inflammation."

"9323669","Fetal inflammation and infcetion remains a major cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity. Our previous studies showed that histological chorioamnionitis (HCA), microbial-driven infiltration of leukocytes to the maternal-fetal interface, was associated with a focal increase in the number of Hofbauer cells (HBCs) (i.e. placental macrophages of fetal origin located beneath the syncytium and adjacent to fetal capillaries), in the placental villus. Elucidation of cell type-specific responses to polymicrobial challenges would lead to new interventions which reduce the incidence of and/or severity of adverse outcomes including fetal-inflammatory response syndrome (FIRS), a multisystemic/microbial-driven inflammation in the umbilical cord (funisitis) and fetus, which is associated with significant neonatal/pediatric mortality and morbidity. Microbial compounds trigger innate immune response through Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and TAMs, a recently characterized subfamily of protein tyrosine kinase receptors shown to inhibit TLR function in non-placental cell types. In addition, inflammatory response to microbes is regulated through the inflammasome, a multi-protein complex. Our central hypothesis is that herpes virus infection of HBCs suppresses their inflammatory responses to bacteria by altering TAM receptor and Nalp3 inflammasome function, thus inhibiting HBCs' ability to control bacterial growth and, therefore, exacerbating placental/fetal infection, and chorioamnionitis. Our Specific Aims will: 1) Test the hypothesis that herpes virus infection of HBCs blocks LPS-induced TNF-? and IL-1? through modification of the expression and function of TAM receptors and the Nalp3 inflammasome; 2) Test the hypothesis that HV infection of HBCs increases TAM receptor function and inhibits inflammasome activity which promotes the migration and colonization of bacteria to the fetus; 3) Test the hypothesis that a polymicrobial herpes virus-bacterial infection increases placental macrophages with a suppressed inflammatory phenotype in vivo, promoting the migration of bacteria from mother to the fetus."

"9392356","Inflammation/infection has been implicated in the origin of 20-30% of epithelial cancers and, in many cases, occurs concurrently with increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the precise pathways linking infection/inflammation to cancer are not well defined. Our data demonstrate that induction of the polyamine catabolic enzyme spermine oxidase (SMOX) by infection/inflammation produces DNA-damaging ROS and causes changes observed in carcinogenesis; inhibition of SMOX reduces the incidence of the observed carcinogenic changes. Importantly, we have compelling data indicating that the DNA damage induced by ROS leads to epigenetic transcriptional silencing. These data identify a molecular pathway in which infection/inflammation-induced SMOX activity is directly linked to carcinogenesis and define SMOX as an attractive target for chemoprevention. Selective inhibitors of SMOX would be of great value as probes to study inflammation/infection-induced carcinogenesis and would hold potential as chemopreventive agents, but, unfortunately, no such inhibitors exist. In light of these facts, the overall goals of this application are to identify and test selective inhibitors of SMOX that can serve as tool compounds and leads for the identification of chemopreventive agents. The following Specific Aims are designed to pursue these goals. Aim 1. To identify inhibitors of SMOX using chemical synthesis of analogues, similarity searching, and structure-based design techniques. We will use multiple medicinal chemistry approaches to identify and synthesize potential inhibitors of SMOX, followed by hit-to-lead optimization of selected compounds with therapeutic potential. Aim 2. To evaluate newly synthesized compounds for the ability to selectively inhibit SMOX and alter cellular response. The goal of this specific aim is to identify compounds that have selective inhibitory activity against SMOX with little or no inhibitory activity against closely related FAD-dependent amine oxidases, including the MAOs and LSD1. In this aim, we will determine the enzyme inhibitory kinetic profile for selected analogues, and we will determine the cellular effects of SMOX inhibition by these analogues in vitro. Aim 3. To evaluate the effectiveness of SMOX inhibitors in vivo. As the primary purpose of this proposal is to identify effective and selective inhibitors of SMOX that have potential as chemopreventive agents, it is critical that they demonstrate effectiveness in a relevant carcinogenesis model. We will use our ETBF/Min mouse colon tumorigenesis model and a Mongolian gerbil model for H. pylori-induced gastric cancer, as we have previously published, to determine the in vivo anticancer effectiveness of newly identified SMOX inhibitors."
"9527354","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The gammaherpesviruses establish lifelong latency in the human host. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesviruses (KSHV) and Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) are members of this family. These viruses are associated with several different cancers in the human population, are present in the oral cavity, and can be transmitted orally. The gammaherpesviruses establish life-long latency in the host. During latency the viral genome is chromatinized by host factors, and viral gene expression is extremely limited during latency. However during viral reactivation, many of the chromatin modifications are changed resulting in the transcription and expression of many more viral genes. We have recently performed a siRNA screen and identified a novel cellular kinase, tousled like kinase (TLK) that is involved in regulating the gammaherpesviral latent-lytic switch and modulating the host genome. In response to RFA-DE-13-002, we propose to understand how TLK regulates the viral epigenome to augment latency and suppress reactivation. Understanding of the mechanism involved in governing gammaherpesviral latency and reactivation is relevant to oral cancer and oral disease associated with replication of these viruses. Our investigation may help guide novel therapies for treatment of oral disease."
"9398771","Project Summary/Abstract Hypertension is prevalent in 68.5 million U.S. adults and is one of the leading chronic disease risk factors in the world. The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) evaluated the effect of intensive (<120 mmHg) and standard (<140 mmHg) BP targets on cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. Intensive BP lowering was associated with a 25% reduction in cardiovascular events and a 27% reduction in all-cause mortality. BP measurement in SPRINT followed guideline adherent protocols. Unfortunately, BP measurement in routine clinical practice is often not adherent to American Heart Association recommendations; inappropriate technique is associated with an overestimation of BP by approximately 5 to 15 mmHg. Therefore, the achieved BP in routine clinical practice during the treat to target phase of SPRINT is unknown. An additional limitation of SPRINT is that acute kidney injury (AKI) was only assessed in the inpatient setting and adjudication was based on billing codes and discharge summaries, not the gold standard for assessing AKI ? creatinine values. Fortunately, SPRINT was one of the first large trials performed in the era of electronic health records (EHRs). The timing of the SPRINT trial provides a unique opportunity to link SPRINT data to EHR data to perform analyses that would be otherwise infeasible within either data source alone. The goals of the proposed study are to a) inform implementation of the SPRINT results by comparing contemporaneous BP in the routine clinic setting to those measured at SPRINT study visits, b) provide creatinine values to assess the effect of intensive and standard BP targets on rates of AKI and other renal outcomes during the trial and in long-term, post-trial follow-up, and c) inform the design of future pragmatic clinical trials by reporting on the concordance between EHR based and formal SPRINT based assessment of renal and cardiovascular outcomes. For the proposed study, SPRINT and EHR data (BP and creatinine values and ICD-9/10 codes) from a number of the larger SPRINT sites will be linked. The specific aims are to evaluate 1) the concordance between BP measured in the general clinic setting to BP measured using guideline recommended technique at SPRINT research visits; 2) the effect of intensive versus standard BP targets on renal and cardiovascular outcomes using SPRINT and EHR based creatinine values; and 3) the concordance between EHR based and formal SPRINT based assessment of renal and cardiovascular outcomes to inform the design of future pragmatic clinical trials. Our results will support physicians and clinic managers in their efforts to implement appropriate BP measurement protocols and will inform implementation of the SPRINT results. Finally, this study will be the first to link clinical trial data with EHR data on a large scale and will serve as an example for how these types of data can be merged to leverage the strengths of both data sources."
"9356947","Project Summary ? Project 1 Tumor progression is the product genetic mutations that affect gene function and epigenetic alterations that affect patterns of gene expression and cellular states. Together with the effects of the tumor microenvironment, these changes produce the phenotypes that underlie the biology of cancer. From extensive genomic studies performed over the past decade the genetic landscape of cancer progression is beginning to emerge, but much less is know about how tumors evolve epigenetically. Project 1 is focused on the investigation of tumor evolution through the lens of changes in epigenetic states and gene expression programs. It is anticipated that an improved understanding of these aspects of tumor development will yield new strategies to intervene in this process as well as to treat established tumors. Three Specific Aims will be pursued addressing these questions in the context of well-established genetically-engineered mouse models of human lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) based on mutations of K-ras (?K?) or the combination of K-ras and p53 (?KP?). Of note, K-ras mutations occur in approximately 30% of human LUAD and targeted therapies do not exist for this subtype of the disease. Preliminary data in support of the Project 1 demonstrates that as tumors progress in the KP model they develop subpopulations of cells that have cancer stem-cell like properties and show markers of response to the Wnt signaling pathway and other cells that markers of Wnt-producing cells that express the enzyme Porcupine (Porcn). It is hypothesized that these Porcn+ cells act as niche cells for the cancer stem-like cells. In Aim 1, a combination of genetic marking, molecular profiling and cell ablation studies will be used to characterized and functionally test these putative niche cells for their importance in tumor development. These studies may identify new targets for the treatment of human lung cancer. Using single cell mRNA sequencing (SCmRNAseq), performed in collaboration with the laboratory of Aviv Regev, the Jacks laboratory has profiled individual cancer cells from K and KP tumors. These data reveal extensive intratumoral and intertumoral transcriptional heterogeneity. Aim 2 of Project 1 will complete the characterization of transcriptional heterogeneity as a function of tumor genotype and tumor progression as well as explore the epigenetic mediators of these effects. Finally, the transcriptional programs of cancer cells are expected to be affected by immune infiltration and anti-tumor immune responses, potentially in a heterogeneous fashion across tumors. These questions will be explored in Aim 3 of Project 1 using SCmRNAseq-based profiling and functional studies of ?immunogenic and ?nonimmunogenic? tumors. The identification and functional validation of pathways that contribute to immune suppression in this model could reveal new targets of therapy for human lung cancer and other cancer types. In all of the Aims of Project 1, a series of innovative genetic technologies (including lineage tracing, cell marking, cell ablation, and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing and gene activation) will be used to functionally characterization of genes and pathways identified through profiling."

"9371609","Project Summary Dr. Macey L. Henderson, JD, PhD, is research faculty in the Department of Surgery at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. She seeks a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award in order to gain training and experience in patient-oriented research, qualitative methods, mHealth intervention development, and RCT design. Live donor kidney transplantation (KT) offers patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) timely treatment with superior outcomes to dialysis or deceased donor KT. But for the 6000+ live kidney donors (LKDs) yearly who make the sacrifice, and the 100,000+ living with one kidney, nephrectomy represents an elevated risk of kidney disease and other comorbidities. Dr. Henderson is a previous kidney donor and has dedicated her career to improving the lifelong donor experience. Currently, the most striking gap in the care of LKDs is the lack of regular medical follow-up. While hardly adequate for true care of LKDs (policy only requires follow-up to 24 months), implementation of even this rudimentary requirement has proven nearly impossible: LKDs between 2013-2015 still have only 68%, 62%, and 53% successful follow-up at 6, 12, and 24 months, with no further improvement since the policy requirement, even in the face of disciplinary action to centers who do not meet follow-up benchmarks: clearly transplant centers currently lack the tools to improve LKD engagement. Given the embarrassing failure of the current system of LKD follow-up, alternative approaches are of the utmost urgency for the medical community to uphold its obligation to care for these altruistic, at-risk individuals. Follow-up barriers cited by transplant centers, including administrative burden, cost, and lack of patient engagement, may be overcome by leveraging electronic communications and mobile health (mHealth) technologies which are convenient, low cost, and easily scalable. The aims of the project are: 1) to analyze preferences for and barriers to adoption of mHealth by LKDs and transplant providers, 2) to develop a functional mHealth system to support LKD follow-up and engagement, and 3) to pilot the mHealth system and design a future randomized control trial of this intervention. This proposal gives Dr. Henderson the training required to complete the proposed research. This knowledge can support the development of patient-oriented ESRD prevention strategies, promote health maintenance behaviors, and lay the foundation for a randomized controlled trial of our novel mHealth system. Our findings will address a critical knowledge gap in how follow-up and patient-engagement for LKDs can be improved. Conducting this study will expand Dr. Henderson's skillset to include patient-oriented research, qualitative methods, mHealth intervention development, and RCT design enabling her transition to independence."
"9319169","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions)  The Mouse Histology and Phenotyping Laboratory (MHPL) provides the Northwestern University research community with histopathology assessment of murine tissues by trained pathologists and comprehensive histology services performed by expert histotechnologists. In addition, training is provided for investigators to learn to detect gross anomalies in rodents, to harvest tissue from various organ systems and to perform immunohistochemical and special histological stains on tissue sections generated by the MHPL. The MHPL was developed to fulfill a need by the investigative community to assist with the analysis of new murine models, to leverage the expertise of pathologists in the histopathological assessment of tissue anomalies and neoplasms, and to increase the likelihood of extracting meaningful phenotypic information to guide future investigations. Murine tissue has histological characteristics distinct from human tissue and therefore accurate interpretation requires microscopic examination by.pathologists with an understanding of disease pathobiology, rodent histopathology and murine development. Moreover, tissue isolation, processing, and sectioning often require the involvement of highly skilled histotechnologists, especially when embryonic lethal phenotypes or complex developmental abnormalities are to be studied. The MHPL is directed by an anatomic pathologist and neuropathologist with more than twenty years of experience in diagnosing human tumors and developmental abnormalities. He has equally extensive training in rodent adult and developmental pathobiology and histopathology. Other members ofthe MHPL staff include a second fulltime associate pathologist, three full-time ASCP certified histotechnologists, two part-time histotechnologists and two part-time technical/administrative assistants. Together, this team provides a broad range of technical and diagnostic services to investigators throughout the Northwestern University research enterprise in a high-volume and fast-paced environment. These comprehensive histopathology support services enhance the ability of our Cancer Center investigators to characterize viable and embryonic lethal mouse models and to develop and analyze new in vivo model systems to study cancer biology."

"9388655","Project Summary The motivation for my research program has been to understand how oncogenic signaling promotes human cancer. An important facet of our work, which distinguishes our contributions from those of others, is that we have focused on fundamental questions about molecular mechanisms of both normal and aberrant signaling, emphasizing structural, biochemical, molecular, and cell-based approaches. My overarching research goals over the award period build from our sustained contributions over almost two decades in the Notch field, and will emphasize answering the following key questions: i) What is the molecular mechanism of normal and pathogenic Notch activation by ADAM-family proteases? Ligands normally convert Notch receptors from a dormant to signaling-active state by rendering them susceptible to proteolysis by ADAM-family metalloproteases at a site immediately external to the cell membrane, yet our understanding of ADAM-mediated proteolysis of Notch receptors remains remarkably rudimentary. We will elucidate the structures of the full ADAM10 and ADAM17 ectodomains, and determine how interplay between the regulatory and catalytic domains of the ADAMs executes Notch proteolysis in normal and oncogenic signaling. Structural features that distinguish the ADAM10 active site from that of ADAM17 can then be used to guide development of highly selective ADAM10 or ADAM17 inhibitors. ii) What is the molecular mechanism of engagement of the transcriptional machinery by Notch nuclear complexes? Binding of intracellular Notch (ICN) to the RBPJ transcription factor in the nucleus leads to MAML recruitment, but how Mastermind-like proteins (MAMLs) cooperate with Notch-RBPJ complexes to induce transcription remains a fundamental unresolved question in the field. By defining the sequence of events connecting Notch1 signaling and MAML1 recruitment to gene expression changes, we will illuminate the role of MAML in the response of cancer cells to Notch activation. iii) What is the molecular mechanism of feedback regulation by Notch transcriptional targets? As a core transcriptional target regulated by Notch in diverse cell types, NRARP is an integral part of the Notch signal transduction circuitry, acting as a negative feedback regulator of signaling by binding to the core Notch transcription complex. Our goals will be to elucidate the structural basis for NRARP recruitment to the Notch transcription complex, uncover the molecular mechanism underlying assembly of NRARP inhibitory complexes, and elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying NRARP inhibition. Together, these studies will uncover a central mechanism of Notch signal modulation, and create opportunities for development of novel regulators of Notch signaling."
"9384436","Project Summary/Abstract: We now appreciate that Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is caused by multiple variants defined by CFTR2 comprising >300 clinically validated variants contributing to disease. Deletion of Phe 508 from the first nucleotide binding domain (NBD1) of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein is the prominent mutation found in ~90% patients, a residue critical for both intra- domain and inter-domain contacts controlling the intrinsic thermodynamic stability of the CFTR fold and channel function. Folding of CFTR and its function is determined not only by its primary sequence, but by an extensive proteostasis network that chaperones the dynamic protein fold throughout it?s lifespan. In addition to an improved understanding of the roles of proteostasis and interaction networks during the previous funding period by the Balch laboratory, the Riordan group has made major advances in addressing the structural elements of CFTR responsible for its marginal thermodynamic stability that make the fold susceptible to complete destabilization by single amino acid changes. The unifying hypothesis from Balch and Riordan underpinning this proposal is that variants impacting the ?functional? structure of CFTR in the cell are manifested as networking problems within the dynamic protein conformational organization of CFTR (cis interactions) and between this dynamic structural network and components of proteostasis network in trans. Our objective is to understand the relationship(s) between these cis and trans networks in depth by focusing on the properties of the fold found in vivo (Balch) and relating these biological properties of the physiololgic fold to biochemical, biophysical and structural features defined in vitro (Riordan). Unique to our hypothesis is the postulate that proteostasis biology can be modified to ?repair? the function of CFTR folding mutants by impacting their stability and functional dynamics. These issues will be addressed in two Aims. Aim 1 (Balch and Riordan) will jointly focus on understanding key proteostasis components contributing to loss and correction of F508 function in the NBD1 domain in vivo (Balch) in relation to its conformational stability in vitro (Riordan). Balch will investigate the role of factors influencing mRNA stability, translation and early folding events that we hypothesize are critical to management of the structural defects directing export from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for downstream function. The Riordan laboratory exploit major advances made in the expression and purification of high quality wild-type (WT) and variant CFTR protein suitable to understand these NBD1 defined events at the biochemical, biophysical and structural levels in vitro in the context of the full- length protein. Aim 2 will expand Aim1 to focus on additional rare CFTR2 variants that tune the fold of NBD1 to understand the differential impact of proteostasis in the global management of NBD1 with the hypothesis that each variant provides a unique view into intermediate folding states responsible for function. Integration of the long-term Balch and Riordan efforts will now provide an unprecedented understanding of the CFTR folding landscape."

"9300665","Abstract Few studies have been designed to assess impacts of prenatal pesticide exposures on adverse pregnancy events and outcomes including preterm birth and fetal growth. Earlier epidemiological studies were mainly relatively small case/control studies, with limited information about exposure relying on self-reported data that produced equivocal findings. Recently, reports emerged suggesting pregnancy complications such as gestational diabetes, or preeclampsia in relation to early pregnancy exposure to pesticides. Endocrine disrupting properties suggested for several classes of agricultural pesticides, have been proposed to contribute to increases in risks for adverse pregnancy events and birth outcomes. Thus a well-designed large scale population based study with detailed and reliable pesticide exposure assessment (not based on parental recall) is urgently needed. Our proposed study will address this gap in a highly efficient and timely manner, leveraging our existing resources established with funding from NIH, by combining sophisticated pesticide exposure assessment with large-scale population and record-based birth cohort data. California is an excellent locale for such a study: the state ranks 1st among US states in agricultural production, with 1/4 of US total agricultural pesticide use, and is the only state which maintains a statewide pesticide use reporting system. Building onto this unique resource, our team has longstanding experience developing and applying a geographic pesticide exposure assessment tool (GRAPES) that utilizes the unique California Pesticide Use Report system, in combination with agricultural land-use maps, to derive estimates of residential exposures to specific pesticides.  We propose to conduct a records and population based study focused on the agricultural counties of California, including the Central Valley, one of the world?s most intensely farmed regions (the Nation?s ?Fruit Basket?), using all births 1998-2013 (n>700,000) for which we will newly create detailed periconceptional/ prenatal and trimester specific pesticide exposure estimates. We will comprehensively assess risks for preterm birth, fetal growth indicators, fetal and infant death, and pregnancy complications (gestational diabetes, preeclampsia). This approach will provide the - to our knowledge - largest population based study with advanced exposure assessment not relying on self-report, to address the hypotheses that exposure to specific chemicals such as endocrine disrupting agents increase risk for adverse birth outcomes. For this study, we will focus on chemicals used in high volume, potential endocrine disrupters, and those previously found to have adverse effects in animal/human studies, including glyphosate, organophosphates, neonicotinoids, pyrethroids. Thus, leveraging the resources we previously created with NIH funding, this study will likely have high impact as it addresses public concerns about prenatal health effect of pesticide exposures, and has the potential to influence public health policies and future research in a highly cost-efficient manner. The design of future biomarker studies we plan, will build upon the findings of the proposed record-only study."
"9341797","  Abstract / Project Summary Approximately 360 million people worldwide have disabling hearing loss and the vast majority live in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC) were services are scarce. Hearing loss is the most common birth defect and many cases of childhood hearing loss in LMIC are related to untreated ear infections. Unfortunately, many cases of pediatric hearing loss are unrecognized. Many of these children will suffer from poor language development, educational outcomes, and employment opportunities if the hearing loss is untreated. School hearing screening in LIMC is challenging due to high background noise in these environments and the lack of trained personnel. Preliminary research in rural Nicaragua suggests that 27% of schoolchildren fail initial hearing screening exams, but poor quality screening exams from high ambient noise levels lead to a presumed high rate of unnecessary referrals. Less than 10% of these children ever receive further evaluation or treatment. Mobile health techniques that provide early and accurate recognition of childhood hearing loss, combined with a reminder system for appointments, could improve the outcomes from hearing screening efforts. This project combines a team experienced in hearing testing in both rural Nicaragua and Tanzania (Saunders, Buckey) with an innovative noise attenuating-wireless headset with direct mobile communication (via cell phone or internet). Creare, LLC has developed a hearing threshold screening device that performs automated audiometry, is controlled through a mobile platform, and provides superior background noise attenuation using innovative, integrated, high-quality, noise-attenuating ear cups. This technology can also communicate directly with a mobile health network to facilitate initial management and follow up appointments. This project will demonstrate that minimally-trained personnel can use mobile-health-technology-based hearing screening to perform high-quality audiometry on Nicaraguan school children in their schools. The efficacy of this mobile-health-technology-based system will then be investigated in a large-scale study of schoolchildren in rural communities throughout Jinotega, Nicaragua. Children who fail automated hearing exams with this system will receive further evaluations (otoscopy and tympanograms) and management recommendations if appropriate. This information and mobile contact numbers will be uploaded to a Mobile Hearing Health Management System (mHHMS) based on the widely available web-based database management system REDCap, which will be used to make necessary medical and audiology appointments in real time, send reminders regarding appointments, and track identified children through this process. Finally, this mobile health system will be used to determine the prevalence and socio-geographical distribution of hearing loss in Nicaraguan school children. We hypothesize that we will be able to improve outcomes in hearing screening by performing high-quality audiometry in the field, improving compliance with follow-up appointments, and reducing unnecessary referrals.  "
"9358700","The effects of drinking alcohol within recommended limits on risks of CVD, diabetes, and related diseases are perhaps the most important questions yet to be answered in the fields of alcohol, nutrition, or prevention. Approximately half of all adults worldwide report current or former alcohol consumption, and the benefits or risks that alcohol poses to their health urgently need clarification. Epidemiological studies have consistently found that alcohol intake within recommended limits is associated with lower risk of coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and diabetes, yet no long-term randomized trial of alcohol consumption on risk of any chronic disease has yet been performed. In direct response to PAR-16-363 (Multi-Site Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial Research Center on Alcohol's Health Effects), we propose a worldwide, six-year, balanced-design randomized trial, comparing the effects of one standard serving (~14 grams) of alcohol intake daily to abstention on risk of CVD, diabetes, mortality, and related outcomes among 7,800 adults at above-average cardiovascular risk worldwide. To maximize feasibility and reflect actual use most closely, we propose to test alcohol consumption per se to abstention and thus to offer participants flexibility in their choice of beverage, while employing novel and intensive yet efficient methods to monitor safety. The Primary Specific Aim of this trial is to determine the effects of 14 gm of alcohol intake daily compared with abstention on risk of major cardiovascular events or death (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hospitalized angina, need for revascularization, or death) over an average of 6 years of follow-up among 7,800 adults aged ?50 years with estimated 10-year CVD risk ?15% or prevalent CVD >6 months prior to enrollment. Secondary Aims will test the effects of alcohol on risks of incident diabetes and major cardiovascular events. Tertiary Aims will test risks of hard cardiovascular events and progression to impaired fasting glucose. Similar to other large randomized trials, we will establish ~16 centers worldwide using a stepped approach, with a 9-month vanguard phase among 7 centers in the US, Europe, Africa, and South America (in this application), followed by a second wave of additional sites to complete enrollment. Participants will be monitored for safety in multiple complementary ways, including brief electronic real-time reporting and validated yearly instruments and laboratory measures. We have brought together highly successful groups in the US and Europe to establish clinical, data, and biospecimen coordinating centers, our field centers include many of the most experienced clinical trialists anywhere, and our group has strong working relationships with NIAAA and other NIH staff necessary to ensure seamless collaboration during a U10-funded cooperative research endeavor. In this application, we propose the first randomized clinical trial of alcohol consumption, aiming to determine whether it increases or decreases the risk of CVD and diabetes among adults at above-average cardiovascular risk worldwide."
"9208440","PROJECT 4: SUMMARY Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ?-herpesvirus infecting 44-100% of the population and remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in solid organ transplant (SOT) and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (SCT) recipients. Infection in SCT patients is often associated with myelosuppression and graft failure due to virus reactivation from latency but the associated mechanisms are still largely unknown. We have recently identified a secreted viral factor, UL7, containing an Ig-like domain with structural and functional homology to carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1), a protein with multiple cellular activities including differentiation. We recently demonstrated that UL7 stimulates an inflammatory response in endothelial cells, inducing the secretion of IL-6 and other cytokines mediated in part through the phosphorylation of STAT3 and ERK1/2 in the JAK/STAT and MAP kinase pathways. Secretion of IL-6 and activation of the ERK-MAPK signaling pathway have been reported to stimulate viral reactivation. Importantly, we have shown that although UL7 is not expressed during latency, HCMV with a deletion of UL7 fails to reactivate in latently infected CD34+ HPCs in vitro and in vivo although the virus is replication competent in fibroblasts. These data indicate that UL7 is acting after the initiation of reactivation in latently infected CD34+ HPCs but before the lytic program is initiated, suggesting that UL7 reprogramming of the cell is essential for the reactivation event. In addition, we have shown that UL7 is sufficient to promote CD34+ HPC differentiation into myeloid lineage cells. Therefore, based upon our exciting new findings, we hypothesize that UL7 modulates the JAK-STAT-AKT pathways downstream of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) to promote reactivation from latency and cellular differentiation for viral dissemination. In this project we will examine UL7 signaling in CD34+ HPCs and identify the cellular pathways necessary for viral reactivation and hematopoiesis in the context of infection. We will also determine whether these UL7 pathways cross-talk with pathways modulated by US28 (Project 3) and UL133/8 (Project 1) or HCMV miRNAs (Project 2), other HCMV factors important to latency and differentiation that modulate host signaling downstream of EGFR (Project 5). We propose the following specific aims: 1) To determine how UL7 signaling in CD34+ HPCs intersects with EGFR signaling pathways using a multi-omics approach; 2) To determine what molecular characteristics of UL7 mediate HCMV latency and reactivation using both in vitro CD34+ HPCs and in vivo humanized BLT mouse model; 3) To determine what UL7 signaling pathways promote CD34+ HPC hematopoiesis also using both in vitro CD34+ HPC and in vivo huBLT models. Results of this study will generate new virus latency and reactivation paradigms promoting the development of novel therapies to prevent virus reactivation and to treat HCMV-mediated myelosuppression."
"9310655","Project Summary The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway plays a central role in specifying the embryonic pattern of metazoan organs. Post-embryonically, the Hh pathway controls homeostatic maintenance and injury-induced regeneration of adult tissues. Drugs that block Hh pathway activity have received FDA approval or are in clinical trials for treatment of basal cell carcinoma or medulloblastoma, cancers that are associated with elevated pathway activity in primary tumor cells. In pancreatic, bladder, and other cancers of endodermal origin, Hh pathway activity in tumor-associated stroma restrains cancer growth and progression, suggesting pharmacological pathway activation as a potential therapeutic approach. In addition, pathway activation may have a therapeutic role in regenerative medicine through its ability to enhance neurogenesis (e.g., in Down Syndrome), to accelerate bone and muscle repair, and to ameliorate inflammatory bowel disease, among other emerging biological activities. Despite the importance of Hh signaling in development and physiology, and the established and growing role of pathway modulation in control of malignant and non-malignant disease, we fundamentally do not understand how the extracellular Hh protein signal is transduced across the membrane.  The Hh receptor is unusual in that its signaling activity is subdivided into sensing of the extracellular Hh ligand by the transporter-like protein Patched (Ptch), and propagation of this signal into the cell by the seven- transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo). Mechanistically, Ptch is thought to inhibit Smo by acting as a chemiosmotically-driven transmembrane transporter of a lipidic Smo modulator, but the chemiosmotic driver and lipidic substrate of Ptch remain to be elucidated, as does the mechanism by which Hh binding disrupts Ptch activity. We have developed an in vitro assay that directly monitors activity and conformation of a purified, reconstituted Smo protein allowing us to directly test Smo modulation by distinct classes of ligands, including a recently identified class that is the leading candidate for mediating Ptch suppression of Smo. We also have developed a real-time in vivo assay of Smo conformation that monitors Ptch activity, and will use this assay to further elucidate the role of a candidate chemiosmotic driver that we have recently identified. Furthermore, we have purified an active, well-behaved form of Ptch for functional reconstitution and for tests of interaction with candidate mediators; we have in addition generated a cryo-EM based structure of this Ptch protein in complex with a Hh ligand, and will refine this structure as a basis for illuminating the mechanism of Ptch-Smo regulation and understanding Hh inactivation of Ptch. Finally, we will determine how the dual lipid adducts of the mature Hh ligand are shielded within the soluble complex that allows movement of Hh from its cellular source to the Ptch receptor on target cells, and how the transition from this complex to interaction with Ptch is accomplished. Our findings will be integrated into a detailed molecular account of Hh signal transduction, and may provide a basis for improvements in cancer or regenerative therapies involving Hh pathway inhibition or activation."
"9384896","Proposal Summary Intestinal aging is characterized by a decline in stem cell regeneration and renewal, inflammation, DNA damage, and loss of mucosal barrier integrity, all of which can dramatically raise cancer risk. Despite the fact that the vast majority of cancers arise in older adults, tremendous gaps remain in our understanding of why cancer risk rises exponentially with age, including the role of the aging host?tumor microenvironment interaction in disease pathogenesis. Because many age-related cancers are suspected to arise after decades of cell-intrinsic alterations, it seems intuitive that only long-lived cells (i.e. stem and progenitor) would be susceptible to such manifestations, and serve as the origin of many age-related cancers. Relevant to this proposal, we have developed parabiosis as a tractable system for aging research, and used this approach to demonstrate that intestinal homeostasis is markedly impaired in young mice exposed to old blood, suggesting that these phenotypes are mediated at least in part, by systemic factors. Based upon these data, we hypothesize that the old systemic milieu provokes inflammatory responses in the gut to drive intrinsic aging of the intestine and increase the probability for later transformation and tumorigenesis. We will test this hypothesis by performing two innovative Aims utilizing heterochronic parabiosis. In Aim 1, we will determine the contribution of the intestinal microenvironment versus the old systemic millieu in age-related intestinal decline. We have shown that intestinal decline can be instigated by exposure to old blood and hypothesize that this effect requires an altered gut microenvironment. This will be tested by performing heterochronic parabiosis in combination with genetic models and oral mesalamine treatment, to determine whether gut inflammation is required for the age-related decline in intestinal function by exposure to an old environment. Further, we propose that TNF?, IFN? and IL-1? (local and/or systemic) are key mediators in driving local inflammation and DNA damage, both of which are risk factors for transformation. To that end, we will determine the contribution of TNF?, IFN? or IL-1? inhibition with mAbs to restore normal local immune function, reduce oxidative stress and DNA damage. In Aim 2, we will utilize novel parabiotic pairs to determine the role of cell intrinsic versus cell extrinsic aging to Lgr5+ intestinal stem cell-derived tumorigenesis. Specifically this aim will determine the role of Lgr5+ stem cell intrinsic aging versus systemic aging on tumorigenesis and disease progression in isochronic (Y-Y, O-O) and heterochronic (Y-O) Lgr5EGFP-IRES- creERT2/Apcfl- mice. Further elucidating and validating the role of systemic factors in old blood to intestinal aging and tumorigenesis, will not only shed greater light onto the underlying biology of intestinal decline and transformation, but should also important insights toward new therapeutic targets, in an effort to prevent malignancy and promote healthy aging and longevity in humans."
"9477806","Project Summary: Diabetes is a growing epidemic in the United States. Drugs that target glucagon- like peptide-1 (GLP-1) or its receptor (GLP-1R) are used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. In addition to the demonstrated therapeutic efficacy for diabetes, GLP-1 analogs decrease food intake. The effect on food intake is promising because of the clear association between diabetes and obesity. More recent studies, however, show that GLP-1R agonists also decrease water intake. This is particularly relevant for certain patient populations that are at high risk for both diabetes and dehydration. In older adults, for example, the incidence of diabetes is more than two times greater than it is in younger adults and dehydration is common and particularly problematic in the elderly. As such, knowing how GLP-1 affects fluid intake is essential to inform treatment decisions and help lead to future therapies that treat diabetes and reduce body weight, while preventing any complications related to decreased fluid intake. Studies from our laboratory suggest that GLP-1 can act in the brain to suppress fluid intake, but it remains unknown if endogenous GLP-1 is normally involved in the regulation of fluid intake. The studies in this proposal are designed to test the working model that GLP-1 does, indeed, play a role in the control of fluid intake and, more specifically, does so by acting as a satiety signal. The proposal describes experiments that test the following Specific Aims: 1) Does knockdown of GLP-1 or GLP-1R increase drinking behavior and is this effect the same in male and female rats? 2) What effect do challenges to body fluid homeostasis have on GLP-1-expressing cells in the CNS, particularly in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS)? 3) What is the effect of challenges to body fluid homeostasis on targets of NTS projections? These experiments use multiple approaches including viral-mediated knockdown, measures of gene expression, in vivo microdialysis, optogenetics, and refined analysis of behavior to test for changes in fluid intake, neural activity, gene expression, and release of GLP-1. These studies will improve our understanding of the control of fluid intake and could have a broader impact by improving our understanding of peptides that have divergent actions (e.g., used as hormone and neuromodulator). From a translational perspective, the experiments will provide greater insight regarding treatment options for patients with diabetes and could reveal information about the link between co-morbid disorders related to energy balance (e.g., obesity) and disorders related to fluid balance (e.g., hypertension)."
"9240749","Project Summary Ethanol-induced changes in the brain transcriptome underlie the development and persistence of  alcohol use disorder (AUD). INIA-N investigators and others have discovered that ethanol induces  specific and dramatic alterations in a highly restricted group of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) that  includes long ncRNAs (lncRNAs).  We posit that these ethanol responsive lncRNAs coordinate AUD  brain transcriptomes.  Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that individual lncRNAs are key  regulators of ethanol drinking.  To test this hypothesis, genetically engineered mice with altered  expression of lncRNAs will be created and analyzed.  Those mutant lines with altered drinking  behavior will be scrutinized for mechanistic insight by multiple INIA-N investigators. A barrier to the study of ncRNA function in brain is the dearth of efficient methods of  noninvasively delivering ncRNAs and/or ncRNA antagonists to large portions of the brain. Here we  posit that intransally administered exosomes (endogenously produced, liposome like nanoparticles)  can be harnessed to deliver ncRNA anatagonists or mimics throughout the brain. This approach can  also be used to deliver drugs preferentially to brain.  Such an approach would target drugs  selectively to the desired site of action (brain) while avoiding peripheral toxicities that limit  therapeutic efficacy. Because this approach has the dual benefits of target specificity and  noninvasiveness, it has tremendous translational potential.  Specific Aim 2 will test the  hypothesis that exosomes can be harnessed as effective ncRNA/drug delivery vehicles to modulate  ethanol drinking. Genetically engineered rodents permit investigation of the involvement of putative ethanol targets  in the context of whole animal behavioral responses.  Because hypotheses concerning putative  ethanol targets must ultimately explain ethanol-induced behavioral phenotypes, whole-animal  experiments represent the most rigorous test of relevance.  To this end, Specific Aim 3 will create  designer mice for both INIA-N and INIA-Stress investigators. Genetically engineered animals will be  produced using state of the art CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology.  This collaborative Specific  Aim is the continuation of the INIA-West Genetically Engineered Rodents Core that was funded during  the previous project period."
"9321468","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Long Life Family Study (LLFS), established in 2005 in response to an NIA RFA, enrolled families enriched for exceptional longevity (EL), to discover factors that contribute to healthy aging and survival. From 2006 to 2009, LLFS enrolled 539 sibships (G1), their offspring (G2) and spouses (total 4,953). Comparison with a referent cohort reveals that LLFS families have strong exceptional clustering of EL. The G2 offspring have a variety of Healthy Aging Phenotypes (HAPs), defined as an unusually low age-specific prevalence of one or more specific conditions or risk factors, compared to population-based cohorts suggesting enrichment of shared (possibly genetic) protective effects in LLFS families. In the second funding period (2010-2013), we conducted a 2.5 million SNP GWAS (dbGaP phs000397); developed a high-throughput technique and sequenced ~450 candidate genes and replicated many variants and found additional ones associated with Healthy Aging Phenotypes (HAP) and longevity. 54% of LLFS G1 and 92% of G2 remain alive. Participant retention has been 94%. We now propose a third funding period to conduct a second in-person examination (V2) to prospectively study rates of change in HAPs with age and identify genetic and other factors contributing to HAPs and longevity. We hypothesize that EL and HAPs entail common and rare variants that individually have modest effects, but which in combinations strongly influence longevity and specific HAPs, and may only be detectable in family studies enriched for HAPs, such as LLFS. HAPs evaluated at the initial in-person visit show strong linkage peaks which are not explained by common haplotypes interrogated by GWAS (HLODs ranging from 6.0-45.1). These are likely driven by rare, lineage-private alleles that will only be found by sequencing specific families, and may point to important new biology. Specific Aim 1 is to conduct a second in-home examination on all surviving LLFS participants. Specific Aim 2 is to analyze cross-sectional and longitudinal phenotypes. The goal is to identify pathways for EL and HAPs by characterizing the shared and distinct LLFS phenotypes and environmental factors. We will characterize individual longitudinal patterns of HAPs to identify subgroups showing similar patterns and exceptional phenotypes. We will test whether these HAPs are heritable, and test for differences with internal and external referent groups. Specific Aim 3 is to find genes/variants associated with cross-sectional and longitudinal phenotypes using a) Whole Exome Sequencing to comprehensively search for coding variants associated with HAPs and EL and b) Targeted Regulatory Sequencing of regions under linkage peaks for HAPs in selected families showing the strongest linkage evidence. Specific Aim 4 is to replicate our genetic and epidemiological findings in other aging study cohorts. This study could lead to the discovery of pathways and potential therapeutic/prevention targets affecting HAPs and EL. A Data Management and Coordinating Center and 4 Field Centers comprise the major components of the LLFS. This renewal application is submitted by the Duke Uni./Uni. of Southern Denmark Field Center."

We have identified a number of abnormalities in the urothelium (UT) of SCI bladders including alterations in barrier function and a hyperplasia as well as a heightened sensitivity to mechanical and chemical stimuli. Changes to the urothelial barrier occur as early as a few hours following SCI and may be mediated in part by an interaction with bladder nerves (directly or indirectly via urothelial-cell interactions). In contrast, the regenerative process (occurs within the first few weeks following SCI) takes place when bladder nerves are quiescent, suggesting a role for additional factors (including trophic factors). These processes are not mutually exclusive, but interact in a complex manner culminating in altered UT structure and function that can impact on bladder function. The goals of this project are to evaluate and understand mechanisms that underiie both the eariy and delayed changes in the UT that occur following SCI. Aim #1 will evaluate the mechanisms by which neurotransmitters promote acute barrier disruption by measuring transepithelial resistance and permeability. We will also examine whether pelvic nerve stimulation mimics the acute changes of SCI on UT barrier function. Aim #2 will evaluate mechanisms underlying delayed responses of the UT following SCI. We will evaluate whether chronic overdistension of the bladder plays a role in urothelial structure and proliferative function and the involvement of NGF by use of chronic antibody treatment in SCI animals. Aim #3 will continue to examine the impact of chronic SCI on UT function by use of in-line isolated cells, bladder sheets and cross-sections of intact bladder and optical imaging to examine transmitters that may influence UT-cell communication. The Ca2+ sensing protein, GCaMP4, will also be used to measure afferent-UT dynamics in a physiologically relevant context. This use of different experimental approaches will help us elucidate mechanisms underlying changes in cellular responses in SCI. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The bladder urothelium, in addition to its barrier function, plays an important role in the transduction of sensory events. Understanding how the urothelial barrier is disrupted by SCI then repaired and how changes in epithelial function impacts on sensory signaling is of major physiological importance (potentially providing therapeutic targets to alleviate the downstream effects of nerve injuries)."
"9322323","ABSTRACT The Hepatorenal Fibrocystic Disease Core Center (HRFDCC) has a robust Pilot and Feasibility (P&F) Program that provides one to two years of support for outstanding and innovative research proposals related to hepatorenal fibrocystic diseases (HRFDs), with an emphasis on ARPKD. The mission of the HRFDCC P&F Program is: 1) to attract and support the development of junior scientists interested in HRFD-related research; 2) to enable established investigators from other fields to explore the feasibility of innovative concepts in HRFD; and 3) to entice investigators with existing expertise in the Center's thematic areas to apply their expertise to HRFD-related questions. The Center has been very successful in accomplishing all of these goals and has supported 16 projects over the past nine years. This included support for many physician-scientists and nine investigators that were new to the HRFD field. In agreement with the intent of the Center to serve a national research base and to develop junior faculty, most of the awardees were from outside the HRFDCC institutions (UAB/MUSC/CN) and were at the Assistant Professor rank. Our P&F awardees have been remarkably successful with 35 peer reviewed publications and $10.4 million (from $1.13 million investment in P&F awards) in follow-up direct support related to their P&F awards. Importantly, all but two of the P&F awardees remain active in HRFD research. Major added value of the HRFDCC P&F Program are the collaborative environment established with the UAB/UCSD O'Brien Center, the UAB Nephrology Research and Training Center (NRTC), the CTSA programs at UAB, MUSC, and CN, and the continued leverage of institutional resources to increase investment and training opportunities for the Pilot Program recipients. These joint efforts will allow support for a third P&F award utilizing institutional resources to the HRFDCC and the NRTC for a UAB investigator with a highly meritorious application focused on one of the Center's themes. In addition, the HRFDCC P&F Program is partnering with other P30 PKD Centers for joint mentorship, training, and professional development activities, to develop a national awards program, and for expanded access to resources and important services that will further increase P&F awardee success outcomes. Finally, the P&F Program will offer Vouchers to junior investigators with meritorious projects that did not quite rise to the level of funding in our P&F program (or through other funding agencies) for Core usage to facilitate novel resource or assay development or for preliminary data generation needed for successful grant resubmission. This will also enhance interactions between the Investigator Base and our Cores and promote innovative advances through generation of new models and establishment of new services that will benefit the whole HRFD research field.          "
"9325576","Our goal of identifying novel antagonists of HlV-1 vif involves the efforts of four investigators at four different institutions. The research plan requires close communication between these groups, rapid exchange of data, research materials and reagents as well the ability to solicit input from the Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) and act on that input. These activities will be coordinated by the Administrative Core. The major functions of the Core will include: Coordinate biannual, in-person meetings between project leaders and the SAB in order to overview progress, set milestones and action items for the individual projects. Maintain budgetary oversight for the individual research components and, if necessary reallocate resources if recommended by the SAB. Promote continuous dialog between investigators engaged in the project through teleconferencing. Coordinate data sharing and the exchange of materials at different stages in the project. Coordinate preparation of progress reports to the NIH as well as an annual NIH site-visit. Coordinate the presentation of research findings at scientific meetings and publication of research findings. Serve as an intermediary with the Commercial Ventures and Intellectual Property office of the participating Institutions as well as for any issues that arise through intellectual property agreements. Mario Stevenson, Ph.D. will serve as Director of the Administrative Core and will be assisted by Maria Pieiga who, as Administrator of the Division of Infectious Diseases, has extensive expertise in the oversight of NIH and Industry-funded projects."
"9383521","Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) is causally related to Burkitt's Lymphoma, Hodgkin's Lymphoma, and Lymphoproliferative Diseases in immune suppressed and HIV infected people. In humans deficient in T cell immune responses, Latency III infected B-cells can be highly malignant. EBV conversion of Resting B Lymphocytes to continuously proliferating Lymphoblasts (LCLs) by expressing Latency III EBV nuclear antigens EBNA2, LP, 3A, 3C, and Latent Membrane Protein LMP1, is a relevant and experimentally useful model for EBV oncogenesis. EBNA3A and EBNA3C are essential for LCL growth and they regulate the expression of hundreds of cell genes. EBNA3A and EBNA3C bind to thousands of enhancer sites and alter enhancer-promoter looping. EBNA3A and 3C suppress CDKN2A/B p16INK4A and p14ARF expression to enable continuous cell proliferation. To further characterize the molecular mechanisms through which EBNA3A and EBNA3C regulate transcription, our specific aims are to: 1. Determine the effect of EBNA3A/3C on genome reorganization and their effect on LCL growth using Hi-C and ChIA-PET. 2. Determine the mechanisms through which EBNA3A/3C suppress senescence by examining the effect of EBNA3A/3C on enhancer/silencer promoter looping at the CDKN2A/B loci. 3. Determine the molecular mechanisms by which EBNA3A/C are tethered to DNA. These studies will provide new insights on how EBNA3A and EBNA3C contribute to EBV mediated growth transformation."
"9370886","The goal of the proposal is to determine the potential of a new class of compounds, selective inhibitors of dysregulated proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines, to increase the therapeutic gain for cancer patients receiving radiotherapy for tumors that are known to be radiation resistant (e.g. malignant brain tumors, pancreatic cancer, and lung cancer - stage III/IV). The exploratory proposal builds on our previous discoveries that the lead cytokine/chemokine inhibitor mitigates radiation injury in multiple tissues and the same compound confers an enhancement in radiation tumor growth delay. Two specific aims are planned to confirm the studies in orthotopic tumor models and to elucidate the mechanism of action. In Aim 1, we test the hypothesis that the inhibitor when administered to rats with brain tumors enhances the radiotherapy efficacy and reduces the radiation injury to normal brain. We aim to determine if the therapeutic ratio of a cytokine inhibitor combined with radiation is superior to radiation alone. In Aim 2, we test the hypothesis that the inhibitor suppresses acute proinflammatory cytokines including those produced by activated macrophage in the tumor tissue and reduces neuroinflammation caused by activated microglia in the normal brain following radiation. We aim to elucidate the mechanism of action of a cytokine inhibitor?s effects on the radiation response of tumor and normal brain following single and fractionated radiation. At the completion of these studies we expect that a new paradigm for improving radiation therapy will have been initiated."
"9354427","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Conflicting results exist in the literature on the effects of drugs on driving. This is a major concern as 9.9 million persons reported driving under the influence of illicit drugs in 2013. The Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), a census of all U.S. fatal vehicle crashes, is a source of information that could shed light into this discrepancy. However, currently it is not possible to determine tests performed as FARS only records positive and not negative results. This gap is a major impediment to understanding the impact of drugs and driving. FARS also does not distinguish between the active THC, responsible for the acute effects of marijuana, and the inactive metabolites, which can persist for weeks. Therefore, we do not know if fatally injured drivers were under the influence of marijuana at the time of the crash or if the consumption occurred days prior the crash. These deficiencies preclude conducting studies evaluating drug involvement in crashes, trends, or the effects of drugged driving laws. Comprehensive and high quality data on fatally injured drivers exists in certain states with centralized forensic laboratories. The current structure of FARS does not utilize this information as no mechanism is in place to link these reporting systems. The long-term objective of this study is to reduce drug related traffic injuries by developing a reliable databas using toxicology data that can support valid drugged driving research. The main aim of this R21 exploratory grant is to demonstrate the feasibility of developing a sentinel Drug-FARS research database to investigate important issues regarding drugs and traffic crash risk. Subsequent aims include determining the prevalence and trends in drug involvement in fatally injured drivers; and identifying potential states and counties for development of a comprehensive Drug-FARS for future research. This study is an innovative, cost-effective, and sustainable application of data linkage of medical examiner, toxicology, and FARS databases to address the public health need for data on drug use and driving. A multi-disciplinary Expert Working Group will advise on the development of a toxicology database model for traffic fatalities. Toxicology laboratory and medical examiner data from three states, Maryland, Washington, and West Virginia will be examined and data harmonized into common data elements. Linkage of toxicology data with FARS at the state level will enrich the quality data on crash circumstances and contributing factors. The database will be used to determine accurate drugged driving prevalence and trends. In-depth analyses of drugs testing in FARS will also be conducted to identify candidate states for development of a comprehensive Drug-FARS. This research will result in a research database (Sentinel Drug-FARS) that will enable researchers to determine risks related to individual drugs and driving, and to design, monitor and evaluate interventions targeting drugged driving. The fulfillment of the aims will potentially influence the core toxicoloy drug data collection and linkage methodology from the local to the national levels. This study will also contribute to standardize the data process to facilitate comparison across states and time."
"9452501","In the proposed project, we will study the role of mast cells in inflammation leading to brain injury and consequently to mental and neurological disorders after neonatal hemorrhagic stroke, specifically germinal matrix hemorrhage (GMH). Most importantly, we will test whether stabilization of mast cells after GMH will attenuate GMH-induced brain injury and improve mental and neurological functions. GMH is a devastating disease affecting over 12,000 premature infants annually, resulting in hydrocephalus and cerebral palsy, leading to mental retardation and lifelong disabilities. GMH, occurs in nearly half of low birth weight infants, significantly increases risk of depressive and obsessive-compulsive disorders. Additionally, GMH-induced parenchymal lesions and ventricular enlargement increases the risk of attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder. GMH patients who survive without disability will have significantly higher risk of developing attention deficit, anxiety, and mood disorder. GMH induced cerebral ventricular enlargement is a strong and significant risk factor for the development of autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. We recently developed a GMH model in neonatal rats and the neurological sequelae observed in this animal model were similar to that seen in human preterm neonates clinically. In the GMH pups, we observed a significant delay in development, which resulted in the loss of `working' memory' (evaluated by T-Maze test), impaired spatial learning (Water Maze test), and hyperactivity (Open Field test) as well as in motor dysfunctions during the juvenile development stage. In this model, we demonstrated that TGF?1 accumulation and the activation of the TGF? pathway significantly contributed to brain injury after GMH. However the source of active TGF?1 in this model remains unclear. In Aim 1 of the proposed project, we will determine if mast cells are a major player in GMH- induced TGF? pathway activation. Most importantly we will determine if mast cell stabilization will decrease GMH-induced brain injury and improve mental functions. In additional to tests mentioned above, recording observations of repetitive stereotypic movements will provide measures of autism-like and/or obsessive compulsive behaviors. Affective behaviors, including anxiety and risk-taking behaviors, will be assessed with the zero maze, and depression/learned-helplessness-like behaviors will be measured using the forced swim, and sucrose preference tests. Finally, social dominance, approach, and scent marking will be measured by recording observations associated with exposure to novel females and males. For mast cell stabilization we will use 1) Omalizumab, the drug clinically approved for treating the diseases related to pathologic mast cell activation in humans and 2) Hydrogen inhalation, a safe treatment without reported side effects. In Aim 2, we will study the mechanism of mast cell stabilization-induced brain protection. We hypothesize that inhibition of mast cell mediators will attenuate TGF? activation thus decrease brain inflammation via downregulation of IL- 17, resulting in the attenuation of brain injury and neurological deficits after GMH."
"9319285","PROJECT SUMMARY Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness in the world, affecting over 60 million people. Extensive research has demonstrated that increased intraocular pressure (IOP) results in a progressive loss of ganglion cells that is subsequently expressed as a loss of vision. The exact relationship between the chronic dynamics of IOP and the damage experienced by the eye is still unknown and is the central focus of glaucoma studies across the world. Over the years, scientists have developed several animal models in which a wide variety of methods is used to damage the drainage pathways of the eye so that fluid cannot get out as easily. Such techniques tend to be time consuming, present a low success rate, last permanently, and offer no control over IOP amplitude or dynamics. All of these issues significantly hamper our continued ability to study the causes and effects of the disease. Current technology to monitor IOP is also a limiting factor. Tonometry, the most used technique to measure IOP, yields insufficient data and requires a skilled operator at all times. Implantable sensors have been commercially developed to address the issue but they rely on battery power to function, which limits their operating lifetime and the accuracy of the data collected. This project describes one-of-a-kind wireless implantable devices that are capable of continually measuring and regulating IOP, doing so with high accuracy, near-zero failure rate, and virtually unlimited operational lifetime. For the first time they give the experimenter complete control over the IOP history to which an eye is exposed. This project proposes to use the technology to investigate the response and resiliency of the eye to elevated IOP when fluid drainage pathways are not overtly damaged like in all other animal models of the disease. The specific aims are to systematically and quantitatively assess the effects of experimental glaucoma and this new perfusion-induced hypertension model on: i) IOP variability, ii) ocular fluid dynamics, iii) retinal structure and function, and iv) visual sensitivity of rats."
"9322322","PROJECT SUMMARY There is no FDA-approved therapy for any form of HRFDs. However, molecular pathways highly relevant to pathobiology of several specific HRFD have recently been identified. This raises hope that pharmacological targeting of druggable components of these pathways may attenuate HRFD progression. Since similar level of disease knowledge triggered identification of FDA-approved treatments for other inherited disorders (e.g., cystic fibrosis), we believe that comparable success can be achieved for at least some forms of HRFD. To help facilitate this goal, we have established the Therapeutics Development and Screening Resource (Core D) to provide essential tools, models and technologies, along with an integrated plan for their use in lead compound optimization and preclinical development.  Specifically, (i) to address lack of predictive in vitro assays that can be used to identify and characterize HRFD lead compounds, Core D will develop a tractable model for lead compound identification consisting of a well characterized panel of cell lines with known HRFD mutations. Coupling of such cell-based resource with HRFD relevant reporter assays offers innovative and robust tool for identification of HRFD lead compounds and for characterization of functional HRFD protein domains that are potentially targeted with a single drug. (ii) To improve assessment of drug efficacy, Core D will develop in vivo predictive models for standardized longitudinal monitoring of drug effects in animal HRFD models using established and newly developed markers of the disease progression. (iii) To enhance preclinical safety assessment of prioritized drugs, Core D will develop HRFD-specific toxicology and safety screens.  In summary, to advance development of HRFD therapeutics, Core D will establish innovative drug discovery and standardized drug efficacy screening systems. These newly developed resources will be made available to the HRFD Core Center Investigator Base to advance discovery and evaluation of new HRFD therapeutics. In addition, a standardized strategy for drug efficacy testing in HRFD models will help to solidify emerging hypotheses by providing cost-effective in vivo evaluation of specific HRFD progression modulating effects. Therefore, we anticipate that Core D will also catalyze development of HRFD therapeutics indirectly by attracting additional funding to HRFD research by enhancing quality of HRFD grants and manuscripts and by attracting new non-HRFD investigators to this field.  "
"9379383","This new R01 application is submitted in response to Funding Opportunity RFA-CA-15-008 ?Research Answers to NCI's Provocative Questions?. The hypothesis to be tested is in response to PQ3. We hypothesize that the benefit afforded by immune surveillance to the individual and populations of cancer patients may depend on the levels of aneuploidy and expression of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) complex Class II (MHCII) in the tumor. We further predict that a population of individuals defined by tumors with high aneuploidy and low MHCII expression is at higher risk of progression and poor outcome, and unresponsiveness to immunotherapy by regulating the size and composition of intra-tumor immune infiltrates. Within this new paradigm, we also propose to investigate the possible causative mechanism of aneuploidy- induced proteotoxic stress. The study will be a combination of genomic analyses and immunological interrogation in UCSD Moores Cancer Center patients, and will ultimately seek validation in through TCGA data as well as data from immunotherapy trials. We propose four Aims. (1) To validate aneuploidy/MHC II as predictors of progression and clinical outcome. TCGA data will be interrogated to relate an association between aneuploidy and levels of MHCII expression to overall survival. and response in immunotherapy (ICPi) trials. (2) To measure markers of natural immune response in cancer patients grouped according to aneuploidy/MHC II status. We will study the size and clonality of tumor-infiltrating T cells by profiling TCR reactive with TERT, an antigen expressed by cancer cells at every stage of differentiation, as a proxy of the autochthonous anti-cancer response. By comparing tumor-infiltrating T cells to circulating T cells, we expect to determine if (a) tumor the aneuploidy/MHCII signature predicts T cell infiltration, and (b) lower immune T cell infiltration displays high TCR heterogeneity. (3) To determine whether aneuploidy/MHCII status interferes with response to ICPi therapy. We will determine if high aneuploidy/low MHCII expression impairs immune reactivation after ICPi therapy, and use immunoscore from responder and nonresponder patients. (4) To determine whether proteotoxic stress is the mechanism by which aneuploidy interferes with immune response. Because aneuploidy induces proteotoxic stress, the ensuing UPR provides a mechanistic link between cancer cell biology and immune surveillance. In vitro and in vivo experiments using cells with pharmacologically-induced aneuploidy will be used to determine the extent to which UPR cell nonautonomous effects may account for a disruption of local immunity, i.e., number and characteristics of tumor infiltrating myeloid cells.  We believe that an analysis at the interface between cancer genomic and immune surveillance may reveal general rules for immune-mediated control of cancer. This may help stratify patients and their clinical trajectory, and predict clinical responses to immunotherapy more accurately. !"
"9326962","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity has become an epidemic throughout the world and therapeutics to mitigate this have yet to be successfully developed. In recent years, the relationship between olfaction and metabolic function has become apparent. A variety of metabolic cues alter olfactory behavior by modulating signaling within the olfactory bulb (OB). Likewise, gene-target deletion in mice of the voltage-gated ion channel Kv1.3 yields increased excitability of the primary projection neurons in the OB and a concomitant OB dependent increase in metabolism. The PRIMARY GOAL of this proposal is to determine if targeted disruption of Kv1.3 in the OB can alter metabolism, in turn proving to be a potential therapeutic target for obesity and other metabolic disorders. The METHODS of this proposal are highly interdisciplinary, applying electrophysiology (heterologous expression and traditional slice), pharmacology, nanoparticle technology, drug delivery (surgical implantation of osmotic mini-pumps and intranasal delivery), drug tracking (magnetic resonance imaging), and metabolic assessment. The SPECIFIC AIMS of this proposal are based upon two HYPOTHESES: 1) Addition of an magnetic nanoparticle to a Kv1.3 inhibitor will lead to increased concentrations retained within the olfactory bulb during application of magnetic field and will allow for trackingof the drug vector's distribution throughout the brain with magnetic resonance imaging, and 2) A targeted reduction of Kv1.3 conductance will alter electrical activity in the olfactory bulb, in tun increasing metabolism and reducing body weight. The work in this proposal will develop a nanoparticle drug vector and its pharmacological properties will be determined using patch-clamp electrophysiology. Following delivery of the drug vector to mice, in-vivo magnetic resonance imaging will be performed such that targeted delivery towards the OB can be confirmed and optimized. To determine the drug vector's effect on metabolic function, animals will be housed in custom engineered metabolic chambers while drug delivery is being performed. This work aims to both determine if targeted disruption of Kv1.3 can alter metabolism as well as develop a means of targeted drug delivery towards the OB."
"9409096","Mortality from premature birth has dropped in half in the past decade in Sri Lanka. This tremendous success is tempered somewhat by the large number of survivors who are at risk for epilepsy and developmental disabilities, disorders which often go unrecognized because of poor access to medical services.  We adapt mobile technology so that EEG and evoked potential studies can be done remotely, using Wi-Fi, which is available throughout most of the country, to transfer data to the major medical school in Colombo for analysis. The public health goal of this work is to expand care for children with neurologic problems related to premature birth through the use of novel technology to provide early diagnosis. The research goal is to integrate systematic clinical assessments with portable electrophysiology to identify early markers of developmental disabilities, and to design new therapy based on the capability of a much more timely diagnosis.  In collaboration with the University of New Mexico and the Mind Research Network, a clinical study is conducted that identifies electrophysiology markers of potential value in predicting developmental outcome and risk for epilepsy. EEG studies are performed using a portable system adapted to infants and young children. Electrophysiology is characterized over the first year of life in healthy term born children as well as preterm children, and correlated with developmental outcome in the second year. This project develops a multidisciplinary research team capable of extending preliminary findings to a larger treatment study, based on a novel approach to early diagnosis, leading to more timely and effective treatment."
"9353786","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The diabetes epidemic in the United States (US) has evolved considerably over the last quarter century. Of note, the growth in prevalence and absolute numbers of people with diabetes has far exceeded statistical projections, growing proportions of those affected by diabetes are people of minority race/ethnicities and from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, and onset and first diagnosis appear to be younger than in decades past. Though the evidence base for diabetes prevention and management has grown ? and with that, some improvement in care and control of diabetes and associated co-morbidities ? major gaps persist: 1) The proportion of people with undiagnosed diabetes and prediabetes has not improved; 2) Engagement in prevention is exceedingly low; and 3) Young adults and disenfranchised populations with diabetes fare poorly in terms of control. And, while incidence rates of ?classical? diabetes complications like myocardial infarction, stroke, and amputations have dramatically declined in the last 20 years, again, these declines were less impressive for young adults, minorities, and low socioeconomic populations; and there have been increases in other diabetes complications like cognitive decline, depression, and heart failure. As such, it appears that younger people with diabetes will contend with classical complications earlier in life and older Americans with diabetes will contend with more years of physical and mental disability. This has profound implications for US health care in terms of the volume, complexity (i.e., multi-morbidity) of cases, and health system costs related to diabetes. To address these trends in the Southeastern US, where disparities in diabetes outcomes are particularly apparent, Emory University, Georgia Institute of Technology, and the Morehouse School of Medicine together propose to establish the Georgia Diabetes Translation Research Center (GDTRC). With its broad base of expertise; wealth of federal- and foundation-funded project platforms; access to communities, health systems, local and federal government; and readily-available tools and technologies; the GDTRC is poised to accelerate the conduct and use of diabetes translation research in the Southeast. The GDTRC offers Translation Research Cores (Design and Evaluation; Engagement and Behavior Change; and Disparities) designed to be responsive to the need to close remaining gaps in diabetes detection, prevention, and care, and to the changing profile of the US diabetes population. GDTRC will bring a spirit of innovation, collegiality, multidisciplinarity, inclusivity (e.g., considering disparities from traditional [race/ethnic] and new perspectives [e.g., disparities across the lifespan; disparate outcomes in people with depression or cognitive decline]), and continued learning towards promoting more and useful diabetes translation research. Further, the GDTRC's Regional Core, Enrichment Program, and Pilot and Feasibility Program will ?grow the pie? and generate awareness and demand, linkage to expert faculty, tools (e.g., open- access resource library) and opportunities (e.g., pilot and micro grants), and host online and in-person platforms to engage with GDTRC and its base of tremendous resources."

"9209603","Abstract: The primary goal of this COBRE is to strengthen the biomedical research infrastructure in Louisiana by training Promising Junior Investigators (PJIs) who can develop independent research addressing a major health problem in our region. Virus-associated cancers remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality in our region and disproportionately affect the African American population. These include HPV- associated cervical, anogenital, and head and neck cancers, KSHV-associated Kaposi sarcoma and primary effusion lymphoma, HCV- and HBV-associated liver cancers and others, all which are unusually highly prevalent in our area. Increases in these diseases may be explained, in part, by the large number of HIV-infected patients in the region. In addition, our data also indicate that co-infection of cells with more than one virus promotes or associates with malignant transformation. Therefore, understanding how particular viruses and viral co- infections promote the development of malignancies is essential to identifying and implementing new preventative, diagnostic and treatment strategies. It follows that training a new cadre of investigators capable of conducting novel research in the field of viral oncology is essential for our state. This will be accomplished by developing a Center for Translational Viral Oncology (CTVO) that leverages existing resources in order to train new investigators, develops novel laboratory infrastructure, and supports research projects designed to study these diseases in our unique populations. The CTVO will support the scientific, mentoring and administrative needs of the PJIs by providing (i) experienced mentoring teams composed of NIH-funded and internationally recognized investigators who are committed to guiding PJIs in developing cutting edge research, ensuring their successful training, and supporting their development as independent researchers; (ii) unique clinical material from high risk patient populations ? PJIs will have preferential access to a unique (and increasing) set of clinically annotated biospecimens from HIV+ and HIV- patients with virus-associated cancers collected at the University Medical Center ? New Orleans (iii) well-established administrative and cutting edge scientific infrastructure including integrated cancer and HIV clinical trials programs to translate the findings of these projects, advanced core research laboratories, and a new expanded and unique biorepository, the HIV/Clinical Tumor Biorepository (HCTB) Core. Initially, this COBRE brings four projects led by PJIs to study the role of oncogenic viruses such as HPV, KSHV and EBV, as well as, viruses of increasing interest in human carcinogenesis such as human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), human endogenous retrovirus sequences (HERVs), and human neurotropic Polyomavirus JC (JCV). These cancers arise more commonly in the setting of immune deficiencies (including HIV infection), and disproportionately affect African American patients in Louisiana. Implementation of the proposed work will be directed by the following Specific Aims: 1) to establish interdisciplinary teams of investigators and laboratory core infrastructure to support PJI-led research projects on virus-host interactions and their role in pathogenesis of cancer; 2) to develop an administrative infrastructure to mentor and promote the independent career of the PJIs; and 3) to leverage institutional NIH-funded Centers and Programs at the participating institutions to facilitate the integration of PJIs within the clinical and translational research infrastructure. The completion of this program will provide this region with enhanced capabilities to address these and other virus related health problems that may arise in the future."

Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center is staffed with expertise on survey research design, outcomes measurement (psychometrics) and research operations support activities for cancer projects involving survey data. The Core Facility consists of four faculty social scientists and three research associates, with additional experienced and diverse faculty and staff available to support the activities of the Core. Core Facility faculty are members of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University and have appointments in academic departments in the Feinberg School of Medicine. The specific aims of the Core are: 1. to provide consultative and analytic expertise on self-reported outcome measurement, including special attention to literacy and cultural diversity upon data quality and interpretability; 2. to serve as a central resource for state-of-the-science instruments and measurement methods; and 3. to provide in-house research support services for the translation, collection and psychometric analysis of outcomes and survey data. During the current usage reporting period 08/01/11 - 07/31/12, the Core worked on 70 projects for 46 different Cancer Center members. The Core usage extends across seven different programs, and Core members interact with several other relevant Cores, particularly the Biostatistics Core Facility. In the past 5 years the Outcomes Measurement and Survey Core usage has grown by over 350% compared to the previous 5 years. Core members participated in numerous primary and subcontract federally-funded grant applications and co-authored 88 papers collectively. Over the next five years, the Core will continue to provide the Cancer Center with psychometric and survey research support in the areas of study design, data collection, and analysis and interpretation. State-of-the-science psychometric methods and novel multimedia tools will continue to be used. Collaboration with the Biostatistics, Bioinformatics and Clinical Research Office cores is expected to be strengthened due to shared collaborative interests and support of funded projects. The Outcomes Measurement and Survey Core Facility will continue to respond to user requests for participation in grant applications, expand faculty and staff effort as needed to respond to the changing needs of funded grants, strive to maintain a revenue profile where funded grants represent the majority revenue sources relative to CCSG and institutional funds, and strive to maintain the professional level of faculty and staff through their attendance at and participation in outcomes measurement, survey research, and statistical/psychometrics meetings and conferences."
"9356364","One of the major challenges of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the identification, development and validation of novel molecular markers and imaging probes that would enable earlier detection and provide a rational guide for treatment regimens. We are proposing the integrin subtype ?v?6 as a novel molecular imaging marker for further development and validation combined with a non-invasive peptide-based molecular imaging strategy for in vivo detection of disease progression. ?v?6 is an epithelial-specific cell surface receptor that is undetectable in healthy adult epithelium but is significantly upregulated in a wide range of epithelial derived cancers. This receptor is often localized to the invasive front of tumors and plays a key role in invasion and metastasis. ?v?6 was initially identified in pancreatic cancer with the majority of human PDAC samples tested receiving the maximum score from IHC. The PI has developed an ?v?6-directed molecular imaging agent, 18F-?v?6-binding-peptide (18F-?v?6-BP), which has high affinity and selectivity for ?v?6 integrin and demonstrated favorable pharmacokinetics in tumor-bearing mice and non-human-primates. Approval to proceed with a first-in-human study was recently granted by the FDA.  The overall goal of this U01 is to validate ?v?6 integrin as a non-invasive molecular imaging target for the early detection of PDAC with PET using 18F-?v?6-BP. Our three Aims will run in parallel over this five year proposal. In Aim 1 a) we will evaluate ?v?6 expression in human pancreatic tissue (IPMN, MCN and PDAC), and b) we will evaluate ?v?6 expression non-invasively in murine pancreatic cancer progression models of IPMN or MCN to PDAC using small animal PET imaging to determine if ?v?6 is a useful marker to evaluate progression of neoplastic transformation. In Aim 2 we will perform a human prospective cohort study evaluating ?v?6 imaging. Patient with suspect PDAC and cystic pancreatic lesions (IPMN or MCN) will get standard of care (SOC) treatment, molecular analysis of the aspirate and 18F-?v?6-BP-PET/CT. We will compare a) SOC and molecular testing with 18F-?v?6-BP-PET/CT imaging in risk stratification and b) 18F-?v?6-BP-PET/CT imaging with resected specimen pathology. In Aim 3 we will develop a multiplexed targeting strategy to interrogate two molecular markers simultaneously in vivo. We have selected ?v?6 and Plectin-1 as our initial model as both targets have been identified in PDAC and peptide-based targeted molecular imaging agents already exist for each target.  This targeted molecular imaging approach facilitates personalized medicine, with ?v?6-directed imaging identifying high-risk precursor lesions for intervention while sparing low risk lesions unnecessary intervention. The team assembled has significant expertise and resources in molecular probe development and small-animal molecular imaging that can be leveraged by the Pancreatic Cancer Detection Consortium for rapid validation of future molecular imaging probes."
"9304363","Large-scale population genetic studies have begun to map the genetic architecture of schizophrenia (SZ). We now know that the genetic contribution of this multifactorial trait arises from a variety of lesions that include a) rare copy number variants (CNVs) of strong effect; b) common non-coding alleles of mild effect; and c) rare coding alleles that cluster in biological modules. Our recent studies have afforded us the opportunity to synthesize genetic, genomic, and functional studies to dissect the contribution of microtubule and ciliary dysfunction to SZ and to develop physiologically relevant assays to interrogate the effect of genes and alleles as a means of augmenting statistical power. Here, we will continue to focus on a specific biological module, the protein cluster that regulates microtubule function as it relates to axon/dendritic growth and ciliary function, and to dissect its contribution to SZ in terms of CNV pathomechanism; regulatory mutations; and rare alleles of large effect. We are uniquely placed to measure the contribution of this module to SZ. First, we will improve our understanding of the 16p11.2 CNV pathology, one of the most significant contributors to SZ; drawing from expertise both from our group as well as from Projects 2, 3 and Core C, we will test the contributory hypothesis for KCTD13, a gene for which we and others have amassed strong, but indirect, genetic and functional evidence of involvement. Second, we will assay the downstream effect of changes in four microtubule genes, including changes of regulatory elements, on the rest of the transcriptome and on SZ associated genes and pathways (with Project 2 and Core B). Finally, we will implement our in vivo assays to interpret sequencing data on candidate SZ genes in order to establish the direction of effect of candidate pathogenic alleles and to measure the overall burden of these loci to SZ. Taken together, our work, upon intersection with the studies of the other Center components, will inform the genetic contribution and the biological mechanisms of microtubule (dys)function to discrete aspects of SZ pathology and potentially help improve the design of treatment paradigms and future clinical trials."

"9357689","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV and AIDS has had a devastating effect on family food security and household wealth in sub-Saharan Africa through the debilitation of the most productive household members, decreased household income, and increased caregiver burden. Children under five living in households affected by HIV and AIDS are at particularly high risk for food insecurity and its subsequent negative impacts on nutrition and health outcomes. While there is widespread agreement that interventions to improve food security and reduce poverty may improve ongoing responses to the HIV epidemic, there is a dearth of evidence regarding the effectiveness of such interventions on the nutritional, health and neurobehavioral development outcomes of HIV-affected children. Such interventions are most needed in settings such as Nyanza Region in Western Kenya: a largely rural, agricultural area characterized by high levels of poverty, HIV, food insecurity, and child mortality. Here, we propose to leverage the infrastructure of a recently funded cluster randomized controlled trial (NIMH R01MH107330) designed to determine the effectiveness of a multisectoral agricultural intervention on improving HIV clinical and other health outcomes of HIV-infected adults in Western Kenya (the `parent study'). We propose to assess the impact of the intervention on nutrition, health, and neurobehavioral development outcomes for HIV-affected children. The parent study will include 8 matched pairs of health facilities, randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the intervention and control arms, enrolling 44 HIV-infected adult participants per facility (N=704 adults, 50% female) and followed for 2 years. The proposed study will enroll and follow all HIV- affected children (enrolled at age 6- to- 36 months) and their primary caregiver (age >18 years) who reside in compounds of participants in the parent study (1:1 ratio, intervention and control). The study will include a minimum of 352 children (n=176 per study arm) with their primary caregiver. Children's HIV status will be ascertained, and children will be assessed at regular intervals for two years for the outcomes of interest. Our specific aims are as follows: Aim 1: To determine the effect of the intervention on nutritional, health, and neurodevelopment outcomes of HIV-affected children under 5 years old. Aim 2: To understand the pathways through which the intervention may improve nutritional, health, and neurobehavioral development outcomes of HIV-affected children. Aim 3: To evaluate the incremental cost and cost-effectiveness of the intervention with respect to children's health outcomes (in coordination with the parent study's analysis for adults). By addressing the root causes of food insecurity and poverty, the intervention may contribute to improvements in child nutrition, health and neurobehavioral development. Our project is responsive to several priority areas of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief as well as those of the World Health Organization regarding care and treatment for children affected by HIV and AIDS. Results from the proposed study will provide the needed evidence to promote scale-up of an integrated, multisectoral approach, if it is shown to be effective."
"9336724","Project Summary/Abstract Lanthipeptides are a class of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide natural products (RiPPs) that contain thioether linkages, endowing them with unique activities and protease resistance. This proposal is focused on expanding on the already realized display of the lanthipeptide modified NisA on phage and the remarkable discovery that such phage has a radically shifted host range. Three aims are proposed to characterize, expand, and exploit this discovery. First, clear definition of the means of infection of this phage will provide guidance in engineering future variants with improved properties ? either broader host range or more focused infectivity. An array of competition binding experiments as well as mutation and truncation of NisA are proposed to investigate how the phage infects the host. Second, display of other peptides on phage will both validate the usefulness of the system to display a broad range of RiPPs and potentially further impact the infectivity of the phage. It is proposed to display both additional lanthipeptides and another class of RiPP, the lasso peptide MccJ25. Finally, clear definition of the host range achievable in the engineered phages as well as the range of genetic manipulation that can be accomplished has enormous potential to impact biotechnology through facilitating transformation of industrially relevant bacteria and to impact the academic world through increasing the speed at which knockouts of biosynthetic pathways can be constructed via CRISPR-Cas9 or homologous recombination, thereby enabling rapid determination of natural product maturation pathways or even virulence production pathways. A recent report noted that endowing native bacteria in the gut with new bacteriocin producing machinery allowed them to out-compete virulent strains, thereby restoring gut health. A robust and highly infective version of our phage may be able to perform such a transformation in situ, thereby leveraging native gut fauna to expunge virulent fauna. Moreover, such phage could use a CRISPR-Cas9 system to delete essential genes for virulence. Taken together, these aims will allow the development of this phage variant as a tool for use in biotechnology, academic, and medical fields."
"9384547","Abstract. Building healthy fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption habits early in life are critical for primary prevention of diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease. However, youth in the US do not come close to meeting the national recommendations for FV intake. Given that youth consume 1/3-1/2 of their dietary intake in schools and the school meals program serves over 30 million children, major efforts have been made to improve access and subsequent consumption of FVs through the passage of the Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act. Salad bars are one of the most heavily promoted ways to meet the FV regulations in the Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act as a means to increase student FV intake. Let's Move Salad Bars to School, an arm of Let's Move!, Michelle Obama's obesity prevention initiative, has already instituted over 4715 salad bars in schools, with the goal of having a salad bar in every single school, an investment of millions of dollars. Contrary to popular belief, to date, just a single quasi-experimental study has evaluated the efficacy of implementing school salad bars for increasing FVs; this study was conducted with only elementary students from one school district. No studies have examined whether implementing salad bars in middle or high schools increase students' FV consumption. Grounded in the conceptual framework of behavioral economics, the purpose of this study is to examine whether introducing salad bars in elementary, middle, and high schools that have never had salad bars affects students' FV consumption and waste during lunch. A cluster randomized controlled trial will test new salad bars against wait-list controls for 6 weeks, with and without an additional 4- week marketing phase (N=36 schools, N=6804: n=12 elementary, n=12 middle and n=12 high schools). Plate waste measurements of students' selection of FVs and waste will be used to objectively estimate consumption. The primary aim of this study is to compare FV consumption in schools without salad bars to those with new salad bars by grade level (i.e., elementary, middle, high). We hypothesize that students' FV consumption will be greater in schools that implement salad bars. We will examine three secondary aims: a) how FV marketing impacts the success of salad bars at changing FV consumption. We hypothesize that marketing will help to increase FV consumption; b) assess whether salad bars differentially result in more FV plate waste compared to traditional serving methods; c) test the cost-benefit of using salad bars for FV consumption over traditional serving methods in order to provide better evidence to over 100,000 schools serving meals to children participating in the National School Lunch program. A tertiary aim is to examine how salad bar location (inside service line before point of purchase vs. outside service line) is related to FV intake. When the aims of this study are complete, this project stands to be one of the most definitive studies to date on the efficacy of salad bars in schools and contextual factors that promote their success. Findings will provide evidence for how to best spend limited federal dollars to improve FV intake in schools."
"9350173","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multi-atlas label fusion (MALF) is a powerful new technology that can automatically detect and label anatomical structures in biomedical images. It is arguably the most successful general-purpose automatic image segmentation technique ever developed. Automatic segmentation is in high demand in clinical and research applications of medical imaging, since segmentation forms a crucial step towards extracting quantitative information from imaging data, and since manual and semi-automatic approaches are ill suited for today's increasingly large and complex imaging datasets. Despite a number of papers that demonstrated outstanding performance of MALF methods across a range of biomedical imaging applications, the broader biomedical imaging research community has been slow to adopt this technique. This can be explained by multiple factors, including the technique's high computational demands, lack of a turnkey software implementation, as well as scarcity of validation in clinical imaging datasets and in the presence of extensive pathology. The present application seeks to remove these barriers and to enable a broad range of clinicians and biomedical researchers to take advantage of MALF technology. It builds on our strong track record of innovation in the MALF field, including a novel redundancy-correcting MALF technique that led in segmentation grand challenges in the past two years. Aim 1 seeks to improve the computational performance of MALF by replacing dense deformable image registration, by far the most time consuming component of MALF, with faster and less constrained sparse registration strategies. We hypothesize that this will not only reduce the computational cost of MALF, but will also make it more robust to anatomical variability, in particular enabling its use for tumor and lesion segmentation. Aim 2 proposes algorithmic extensions to MALF that support automatic segmentation of dynamic and multi-modality imaging datasets, which have been largely overlooked in the MALF literature. Aim 3 will develop a turnkey open-source implementation of MALF methodology. Taking advantage of cloud computing technology, this software will allow users with minimal image processing expertise to take full advantage of MALF segmentation on their desktop. Aim 3 will also provide a set of publicly available atlases and the means for users to build new custom atlas sets from their own data. Aim 4 will perform extensive evaluation of the new methods and software in challenging real-world clinical imaging data, including brain and cardiac imaging. As part of this evaluation, we will quantify how well our MALF approach and competing techniques generalize to novel imaging datasets with heterogeneity in acquisition parameters and clinical phenotypes."
"9307917","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An influx of genotype data from disease cohorts and diverse ethnic groups is markedly increasing the power of genome-wide scans for disease association and positive selection. These scans identify loci relevant to the pathogenesis of disease and survival in the face of historic threats such as infectious agents, climate change, and dietary limitations, setting the stage for the development of genotype-based diagnostics and personalized therapeutics to reverse inherited disease and protect against acquired disease. However, it is difficult to isolate disease-causing variants from nearby neutral variants to which they are closely linked. One potential solution is to assay all potentially causal variants for molecular function. However, it is infeasible to individually assay the thousands of variants potentially associated with disease, especially in light of the prediction that most variants responsible for selection and disease will be regulatory. We aim to elucidate novel variants underlying disease and adaptive phenotypes by developing a high-throughput screen for posttranscriptional regulatory function. To accomplish this goal, we will adapt the recently described Massively Parallel Reporter Assay (MPRA) to allow the quantification of allelic differences in expression and translation for thousands of variants in tandem. We will utilize this adapted MPRA to comprehensively assay loci implicated in disease and adaptation for variants with posttranscriptional function. Finally, after identifying variants with quantifiable effects on expression or translation, we will perform targeted follow-up studies to gain mechanistic insight into posttranscriptional processes underlying these traits. These aims will enable us to move from genome-wide scans for disease and selection to elucidation of posttranscriptional mechanisms that may be manipulated to devise novel therapeutic approaches."
"9325996","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Cancer and subsequent metastatic disease continue to be a significant source of mortality. Treatment and outcome are largely determined by whether the cancer has disseminated or metastasized, and once the cancer is no longer locally confined, patient prognosis is poor. We have few treatment opportunities for patients once they have metastases, typically resulting in palliative care. This project aims to study the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) pathway in metastatic prostate cancers, which preliminary data indicates may be a target for therapy and could potentially revolutionize the management of metastatic disease. This proposal focuses on three key areas: 1) Skeletal metastases, which may be dependent upon BMP signaling to persist. 2) Myeloid cell suppression of anti-tumor immune responses, which may be BMP dependent. 3) Restoration of the adaptive immune system to kill tumor cells through targeting in vivo the myeloid immune suppressive cells BMP signaling. Use of small molecule BMP antagonists developed by VA scientists originally for cardiovascular medicine may hold promise as novel treatments in the fight against metastatic cancers."
"9345675","Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) represent a major global public health problem, with an ICU incidence of 10.4% and an associated mortality rate of 35-45%. Early detection of ARDS is essential for appropriate application of Lung Protective Ventilation, the only therapeutic intervention demonstrated to improve mortality in mechanically ventilated patients with established ARDS. In response to this need, tools that electronically monitor ABG results and interpret radiology reports of CXR findings for evidence of ARDS criteria in mechanically ventilated patients have been developed and deployed in critical care settings. Although these tools have been sufficiently accurate to detect ARDS, they fail to detect early stages of disease progression, prior to full-blown ARDS development, in at risk patients. Recent initiatives are focused on tools to identify patients in very early stages of ARDS before wide-spread alveolar damage has occurred, enabling strategies focused on prevention of ARDS development. Among efforts to use EMR data to reliably identify patients at high risk of developing ARDS, the most notable are the Lung Injury Prediction Score (LIPS) and the ?early acute lung injury? score (EALI). Validation studies show these promising tools have discriminating performance with an area under ROC curve (AUC) in the .7-.8 range, and demonstrate risk detection early in the course of illness, well in advance of frank respiratory failure. Our vision is to build on these efforts, and derive a highly automated early identification algorithm based on routinely captured medical record data that reliably and accurately identifies trajectories associated with post-exposure to specific classes of risk factors that predicts patients at risk for development of ARDS with an AUC discrimination in excess of .95. We believe the predictive performance of existing ARDS screening tools can be significantly improved by: 1) combined use of highly specific/sensitive cognitive/explanatory models to help guide machine learning by reducing ?label noise? and identifying specific risk-induced trajectories associated with progression to ARDS; 2) exploring a full constellation of predictive risk factors not yet addressed by earlier efforts; 3) use of advanced natural language processing technology to extract ARDS risk information from free text clinical reports, and 4) use of enhanced machine learning algorithms that are label noise tolerant and combine the predictive power of nonparametric algorithms with the feature interpretability associated with parametric techniques."
"9387932","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Asthma prevalence among children on the Navajo Nation, the largest tribal reservation in the United States, is 2-3 times that of the general population and fueled by health disparities that include devastating poverty, multiple environmental pollutants, and large travel distances to obtain healthcare. Delivery of evidence-based asthma care through the Indian Health Service (IHS), the only healthcare system on the reservation, is inconsistent. While schools and communities identify pediatric asthma as a strong concern, no comprehensive asthma care implementation plan has been previously introduced. Therefore, this proposed study will combine two previously tested programs, one focused on training providers and one on school-based education and monitoring, to build a comprehensive, integrated, team-based Asthma Care Implementation Program to address medical care, family, home, and community to improve the health of Navajo children with asthma. A one-year engagement phase has resulted in strong support from Navajo Nation organizations including the President and Vice President of the Navajo Nation, governmental organizations, healthcare centers, schools, and communities in the three participating agencies (Fort Defiance, Chinle, and Tuba City). Approval of the proposed study by the Navajo Nation Human Research Review Board has been obtained. Key recommendations from communities including use of existing resources such as the Navajo Epidemiology Center, Navajo Health Department, local media, lay health workers, and ongoing involvement of stakeholders are included in this plan. Using a stepped-wedge design, the intervention will be introduced sequentially into three agencies. A mixed-methods analysis strategy will be employed that includes annual examination of asthma exacerbations through the IHS database (primary outcome), interviews with 300 families with a child with asthma, and key informant interviews with healthcare providers and school teachers and nurses. During the sustainability phase, meetings will be held with multiple organizations including local chapter houses to share outcome data, gather feedback, and plan for future dissemination to other agencies and reservations. The RE-AIM framework will be employed to evaluate the implementation process and facilitate dissemination to other tribal populations."
"9317360","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common psychiatric illness that often emerges in childhood and causes life-long disability in over 50% of patients. Psychological theory suggests that OCD symptoms are driven by difficulty disengaging affect from simple tasks (e.g. washing hands, locking a door) due to excessive anxiety about performance errors. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), the gold standard treatment for OCD, repeatedly exposes patients to OC-relevant error cues during task performance until this anxiety habituates. While CBT is more effective in pediatric than adult samples, patients from both age groups are usually left with residual symptoms, highlighting the need for better treatments and raising the possibility that developmentally sensitive treatment may optimize outcomes for individual patients. Brain stimulation and/or cognitive training have the potential to augment CBT, but knowledge of the neural mechanisms of CBT is needed before these strategies can be appropriately targeted. Prior neuroimaging work in adolescent and adult OCD show common and distinct alterations of neural substrate for error-processing, even when OCD symptoms are not directly provoked. Specifically, adolescents and adults exhibit exaggerated anterior insula (aIns) activity, while adolescents show posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC) hyperactivity that associates with lower symptom severity, and adults show atypical aIns - vmPFC connectivity that normalized with CBT. These findings point to developmentally sensitive alterations of error processing in the aIns, pMFC and vmPFC that may need to be targeted to enhance recovery and may need to be targeted differently at different stages of development. Based on these pilot data, CBT could work by increasing pMFC activity in youth, or by restoring the normal relationship between aIns and vmPFC in adults. In distinction to prior neuroimaging research, CBT will be studied in adolescent and adult patients, and in comparison to an active, non-CBT condition to control for non-specific effects of psychotherapy. Sixty adolescent (age 13-17) and 60 adult (age 25 - 45) patients, both with childhood onset OCD, will be randomized to either state-of-the art CBT for OCD, or stress management training (SMT), an active control therapy with minimal effects on OCD symptoms. Using a validated, incentivized performance monitoring task (Incentive Flanker Task, IFT) and resting state functional MRI, the following aims will be addressed: Aim 1) Demonstrate neural changes associated with CBT treatment, and Aim 2) Evaluate the effects of development on mechanisms of CBT. This knowledge will elucidate developmentally specific neural targets at which to direct brain stimulation therapy with transcranial magnetic stimulation and/or cognitive training to augment CBT for OCD."

"9373768","Project Summary Our group has developed an inductively-powered, biocompatible, micro-electromechanical systems (bioMEMs) sensor that is capable of monitoring implant strain and report these data telemetrically using an external antenna. The work-to-date has produced sensors that have been fabricated on non-biological substrates (i.e. silicon and flexible tape) which can be attached to implanted hardware in order to predict the course of fracture healing in the critically-important acute healing time phase (i.e. before radiographic data are capable of discriminating the healing pathway). We have recently designed a novel technique for printing the bioMEMs circuitry directly on bone (boneMEMs) and have leveraged our existing technology to produce a new class of sensors which we postulate can be used to directly monitor bone graft loading and incorporation in vivo. These boneMEMs sensors may represent a significant diagnostic advancement because it is estimated that over 2.2 million bone graft procedures are performed annually worldwide to repair osseous defects, and many of these procedures go on to an unsatisfactory clinical result. For example, typical nonunion rates of intercalary diaphyseal reconstructions range from 15 - 35%, demonstrating the critical need for the development of novel technologies that can predict and diagnose the course of allograft incorporation in the acute post-operative time period. We hypothesize that the boneMEMs sensor can inform on the temporal loading profile and degree of incorporation of osseous repairs using instrumented bone allografts. Accordingly, the proposed research seeks to implement our bioMEMs platform directly on allograft tissue by designing novel architectures and robust biological substrate printing protocols (Specific Aim 1), use a series of in vitro experiments to evaluate the sensor's suitability for in vivo implementation (Specific Aim 2), and perform a pilot large animal in vivo study to evaluate the sensor's ability to monitor and predict large allograft incorporation and healing (Specific Aims 2 and 3). Successful development of this technology will, for the first time, provide clinicians real-time data with regard to the loading experienced by large allografts and a means for predicting the eventual course of bone graft incorporation."
"9470503","Project Summary  In the US, stroke is the third leading cause of death and primary cause of severe disability, with over 700,000 individuals experiencing an ischemic episode each year. Tissue plasminogen activator, the only FDA approved thrombolytic drug for stroke, must be infused within a short period following the initial ischemia and has limited benefits and outcomes. Stroke therapy using adult stem cells such as human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) from bone marrow and adipose tissue sources has emerged as a promising avenue to reduce and reverse neurodegeneration resulting from stroke by promoting tissue protection and repair. The project seeks to (a) investigate the in vivo fate and mechanisms of implanted hMSC that underlie their homing and therapeutic benefits in stroke treatment using high field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) and (b) define expansion and pre-conditioning culture environments that preserve hMSC therapeutic potency. The project's hypothesis is that hMSC expansion conditions impact efficacy in stroke treatment though hypoxic induction factors, and these impacts can be monitored and further optimized with time course information gathered by in vivo high field MRI and MRS about functional recovery. The project is built upon complementary expertise and preliminary results in high field MRI analysis of hMSC fate in stroked animals as well as bioreactor systems for hMSC expansion. The project will investigate the migration and engraftment of culture-expanded hMSC within stroke lesions by MR techniques and delineate the impact of hypoxic pre- conditioning and aggregation on hMSC in vivo fate. The project also will evaluate the interactions of hMSC and endogenous neuroprogenitors and their synergist role in stroke lesion recovery. The goal of these efforts will be to determine achieve timed injections of culture expanded hMSC during stroke recovery and determine the efficacy of hMSC therapy beyond the current window of thrombolytic drugs. Additionally, as a means of translating findings, the project investigates bioreactor conditions that enable scalable expansion to increase availability to human patients and impact therapeutic efficacy. The success of this project will expand knowledge about in vivo hMSC fate as influenced by pre-activation, identify the mechanisms and range of impacts for hMSC action in stroke recovery, and establish a scalable bioreactor strategy for clinical translation. Relevance  Current thrombolytic agents must be employed quickly after ischemic onset, limiting their effectiveness in all but 5% of stroke patients. hMSC promote stroke lesion recovery outside this acute window, but their eventual clinical application requires in-depth knowledge of mechanisms and biodistribution as well as the availability of a transplantable cell population. Utilizing a unique set of experiments, the project is designed to provide mechanistic insights into the efficacy of bioreactor expanded and pre-conditioned hMSC for stroke treatment."
"9388051","PROJECT SUMMARY Inflammation is an immune response protecting us from infection and injury. However, unchecked or improperly activated inflammation can result in chronic diseases such as arthritis, cardiovascular diseases and insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is a metabolic condition in which tissues no longer respond to insulin. A major function of insulin is to lower blood glucose levels by promoting glucose uptake into peripheral tissues including skeletal muscles and adipocytes. Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake is mediated by GLUT4, a facilitative glucose transporter enriched in insulin-responsive tissues. Under basal conditions, GLUT4 is sequestered in intracellular storage vesicles. Upon insulin stimulation, GLUT4 is relocated from intracellular vesicles to the cell surface where it facilitates the uptake of excess blood glucose into the cells for disposal. Defects in GLUT4 exocytosis disrupt blood glucose balance and are a hallmark of insulin resistance. Commonly associated with obesity, insulin resistance is a characteristic feature of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Laboratory and clinical studies have established that inflammation plays a central role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. In particular, the two proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 1? (IL-1?) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF?) directly interfere with insulin responses in adipocytes, hepatocytes and skeletal muscles. While the connection of proinflammatory cytokines to insulin resistance is well established, the molecular mechanisms of cytokine-induced insulin resistance remains poorly understood. The major goal of this exploratory project is to help bridge this gap by globally identifying mediators of cytokine-induced insulin resistance, using insulin-dependent GLUT4 exocytosis as a model system. In this work, we will first determine whether and how GLUT4 trafficking regulators are impaired by IL-1? and TNF?. We will also perform new unbiased genome-wide genetic screens to identify suppressors of cytokine-induced impairment in GLUT4 exocytosis. These exploratory studies will pave the path for a full understanding of cytokine-associated insulin resistance and will likely identify novel therapeutic targets for treating insulin resistance and T2D. This work will also serve as a springboard to understanding other functions of proinflammatory cytokines in the immune system."

Productivity and innovation is enhanced by interaction with other IDDRC Cores, coordinating, e.g., studies correlating brain cell and anatomic changes with behavioral phenotype (AP), genetic or epigenetic evaluations on isolated cell subpopulations (NGEN), and translational studies on reprogrammed cells from patients (HCP). Core resources also serve the U54 research project on 22q11.2DS by providing imaging and quantitative analyses of changes in gene expression, analysis of neural subtypes and dendritic changes in mouse models, and generating iPS cells and differentiating neurons from patient samples carrying 22q11.2 deletions. The Core maintains high standards of quality control through scheduled internal evaluations and the annual user survey carried out by the ADM Core. Collectively, the NCEI Core represents a significant part of the scientific bridge between genetics and cognitive phenotypes and as such has a broad and significant impact on the research carried out by IDDRC investigators that are focused on and critical to understanding and treating IDDs."
"9383658","The use of pyrethroid insecticides has been increasing over recent years since the restriction of organophosphates for household use. Deltamethrin is a potent type II pyrethroid with extensive use in agriculture and residential applications. Detectable levels of pyrethroid metabolites have been found in the urine of the general population, with much higher levels observed in pesticide applicators. More recently, neurological symptoms in individuals highly exposed to pyrethroids have been reported. Cumulative exposure to low levels of pesticides has been hypothesized to contribute to neurological impairment, yet few data related to their effects on cognitive function exist. Indeed, rigorous quantitative assessment of pyrethroid effects on neurogenesis has not been performed, nor have analyses of neurogenesis and behavior been performed in parallel. Our preliminary investigations indicate that repeated exposure of adult mice to deltamethrin, at a dose near the lowest observable adverse effect level, causes ER stress in the hippocampus and deficits in learning and memory in mice. These effects were accompanied by marked increases in dentate gyrus cell death and reductions in stem cell proliferation, suggesting potential effects on adult neurogenesis. Based on these findings, the goals of this project include (1) define deltamethrin effects on adult neurogenesis: morphological analyses of hippocampal stem cell proliferation and their localization, differentiation, migration, and fate, (2) investigate the mechanisms by which deltamethrin exposure leads to disruption of hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive dysfunction, and 3) characterize the relationship between ER stress and hippocampal neurogenesis through pharmacological and genetic approaches."
"9326983","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Enhancing CKD health: Kidney Awareness Registry and Education-2 (KARE-2) trial Abstract Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common, causes excess mortality and morbidity, and is associated with socio-demographic disparities with respect to prevalence and clinical outcomes. Measures such as glycemic control in persons with diabetes, blood pressure control, and reduction of proteinuria with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) can help delay CKD decline and decrease CKD-associated morbidity and mortality; however, many individuals with CKD are not benefiting from these scientific advances. This lack of translation may be due in part to very low levels of CKD awareness among providers and patients leading to inadequate primary care provider self-efficacy for delivery of CKD care and poor patient engagement to participate in healthy lifestyles and adhere to medication regimens. To address this need, our multi-disciplinary team has developed and piloted two interventions that increasing awareness among providers and patients and translate that knowledge into more optimal CKD care. The provider intervention is a CKD registry tailored to the entire healthcare team that provides point-of-care decision support regarding CKD management and outside-of care summaries of CKD relevant clinical data to optimize delivery of guideline-concordant CKD care via outreach and population health. The patient intervention is a comprehensive self-management support program that includes low-literacy educational materials, linguistically/culturally tailored automated telephone self-management support (CKD-ATSM), health coaching, and reminder text messages. Our team has successfully piloted both interventions in a pilot feasibility study (NCT01530958) in one academic clinic that serves a low-income, multilingual population. We have since refined the interventions to integrate the registry with the electronic medical record and to include mobile texting in the self-management program. We are now poised to study the effectiveness of the refined interventions on health outcomes among a large diverse, low-income population using the Chronic Care Model framework of health care delivery. We propose a 2x2 factorial randomized controlled trial entitled Kidney Awareness Registry and Education-2 (KARE-2), in which we will randomize 60 providers and 400 patients with CKD in 6 federally qualified community health centers to receive the provider intervention (CKD registry) or usual care and the patient self- management support intervention (CKD-ATSM) or usual care. We will assess the impact of the provider intervention component of KARE-2 (Aim 1); the patient intervention component of KARE-2 (Aim 2); and their interaction (Aim 3) on patient-level clinical outcomes (e.g., blood pressure, CKD decline); provider behavioral outcomes (e.g., provider self-efficacy for CKD management); and patient behavioral outcomes (e.g., CKD awareness, participation in self-management behavior). If one or both KARE-2 interventions are effective at improving health among high-risk patients, they can be disseminated to other delivery systems to change the way CKD care is delivered in the US, leading to reductions in CKD-associated morbidity and mortality."

"9324850","Abstract: Melanoma Program (MP)  The overall mission of the Melanoma Program (MP) is to improve the clinical outcome of patients with  melanoma. MP members conduct basic and translational research studies to elucidate the mechanisms of  melanoma progression, and the critical pathways of melanoma immune escape, to translate laboratory findings  into novel therapies for both advanced and adjuvant disease settings. Research within the MP falls under three  central themes: 1) immunology and immunotherapy of melanoma; 2) investigation and treatment of melanoma  brain metastasis; and 3) novel investigator-initiated trials (IITs) and combinations for adjuvant and neo-  adjuvant interventions for resectable disease as well as for the early detection and prevention of melanoma.  Specific aims of the MP are to: 1) understand the basic tumor and immune mechanisms of progression and  resistance to therapy; 2) identify new biomarkers of clinical outcome in patients treated in the adjuvant,  neoadjuvant, and advanced disease settings; and 3) translate laboratory findings into novel IITs with  correlative studies at UPCI and in the cooperative groups. The Program has 13 members representing 6  departments in 2 schools at the University of Pittsburgh. The MP is supported by NIH/NCI extramural grants  including an NCI Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) in Melanoma and Skin Cancer. MP  members currently receive a total of $4.2 M in annual direct funding, of which nearly all peer-reviewed support  is provided by the NCI ($1.8 M). Between January 2010 and April 2014, MP members published 190 cancer-  related publications, of which 38% resulted from intra-programmatic and 46% from inter-programmatic  collaborations. Approximately 41% of the papers represent collaborations with external investigators.  Collaborative efforts are fostered by weekly translational research meetings that review all active and pending  MP clinical trials, as well as weekly clinical pathology reviews and monthly research seminars that bring  members from multiple other UPCI programs together for interdisciplinary scientific discussion. The phase II  and III studies of the ECOG-ACRIN Cooperative Group have emerged in part from the work of the MP, whose  members are actively engaged in the research agenda of the National Cooperative Groups, and serve as lead  investigators or co-investigators on ECOG-ACRIN and Intergroup initiatives. UPCI support, including Clinical  Protocol and Data Management and Shared Resources, specifically the Biostatistics Facility, Cancer  Bioinformatics Services, Cancer Genomics Facility, Cancer Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics Facility,  Cancer Proteomics Facility, Cell and Tissue Imaging Facility, Cytometry Facility, Immunological Monitoring and  Cellular Products Laboratory, In Vivo Imaging Facility, Investigational Drug Services, and Tissue and Research  Pathology Services facilitates and enhances MP research."
"9542638","Project Summary Flaviviruses are insect-transmitted human pathogens that most notably cause Zika-associated microcephaly, dengue fever and West Nile fever. This study aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the flaviviral nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), a multi-functional virulence protein. Intracellular NS1 is essential to replication of the viral RNA genome, whereas secreted NS1 interacts with innate immunity proteins and, in some cases, induces disease phenotypes. Our crystal structures of full-length, glycosylated NS1 from Zika virus (ZIKV), dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2) and West Nile virus (WNV) will guide experiments to identify which of the distinct domains of NS1 are responsible for which of its several functions. Despite their overall similarity (~50% identical amino acid sequences), several properties specific to individual flaviviruses are attributed to the NS1 proteins, making comparative analysis especially powerful in dissecting the molecular functions of NS1. An extensive panel of mutants based on comparative mutagenesis of DENV2 and WNV NS1 will be expanded to include ZIKV NS1. Based on observations in the initial comparative study that NS1 affects virus particle assembly, we will test the hypothesis that NS1 acts as an infectivity factor by aiding viral structural protein folding or virus particle transit through the secretory system. Intracellular NS1 is localized to the ER lumen as a membrane-associated dimer with a critical role in replication through association with viral transmembrane proteins. We will probe the interaction with viral protein NS4B through mutagenesis and biophysical experiments. Electron cryo-microscopy or crystallography will be used to investigate the structure of secreted NS1, a hexameric lipo-protein particle. An initial observation that NS1 remodels membranes will be followed by detailed experiments using light microscopy with fluorescently tagged lipids to determine any lipid preference in this key association. Binding experiments will identify which domains of NS1 interact with which domains of two proteins of the complement system and the innate immunity Toll-like receptor 4. The results will provide a foundation for development of antiviral drugs and/or effective vaccines, which are not available or of limited use for Zika, dengue or West Nile viruses."
"9360206","Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a complex disease currently has limited pathogenic understanding and no cure. However, Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have identified ~203 AD-associated loci based on National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) catalog of published GWAS. These loci include ~3738 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with r2>0.8. In theory, there is only one functional SNP (fSNP) in each LD that is responsible for the pathogenesis of AD; however, GWAS cannot tell which one is the fSNP in each LD, a challenge in the post-GWAS era. To meet this challenge, we developed two novel techniques: functional Single Nucleotide Polymorphism-next generation sequencing (fSNP-seq) and DNA competition pull-down-Mass spectrometry (DCP-MS). fSNP-seq is a high throughput screen to identify fSNPs with the SNPs in LD on the risk loci revealed by GWAS. DCP-MS uses fSNP sequences as ?bait? to identify their regulatory proteins in a semi-high throughput way with minimum background. We have demonstrated the feasibility of these fSNP-seq and FREP-MS, a prototype of DCP-MS, in our pilot screening on the CD40 locus as well as in a HTP screen on a library that contain 608 juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)- associated SNPs. In this application, we propose two aims to apply our new methods to the GWAS data on AD risk loci. Aim 1. We will use fSNP-seq to identify fSNPs by screening 3738 SNPs on the ~203 AD risk loci and validate the positive hits by allele-imbalanced electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and/or CRISPR/Cas9. Aim 2. We will employ DCP-MS to identify the AD risk gene regulators by screening on the validated fSNPs and characterize these proteins by shRNA knockdown and/or CRISPR/Cas9. We will focus our study on the fSNPs on the HLA-DRB5/HLA-DRB1, INPP5D and MEF2C loci that are involved in the inflammation/immune response pathway in AD. The goal of this proposal is to build a foundation for us to study cell type specific AD- associated signal transduction and allele specific transcription network for drug development."

"9391520","Proposal Summary/Abstract Glycans play an essential role in the maintenance of diverse cellular functions such as cell adhesion, signal transduction and immune response through interaction with a large number of glycan-binding proteins (GBPs) such as C-type lectins, galectins, siglecs and microbial GBPs. Another main category of GBPs is antiglycan antibodies that are critical determinants for blood transfusion and may also have a tremendous potential as diagnostic and prognostic markers for many diseases including cancer and autoimmunity. Despite the critical importance of GBPs, progress in this field has been slow due to the lack of powerful technologies for evaluation of glycan structures recognized by GBPs. This obstacle was partially alleviated by advent of the solid surface glycan arrays, which greatly enhanced our understanding of glycan functions. However, solid glycan array is technically challenging and cannot be easily made available to non-experts and it is not a suitable clinical tool. With a recent R21 award, we have developed the first generation of Luminex Multiplex Glycan Array (LMGA) containing 202 glycans. LMGA is a technology that meets all the requirements for large scale GBP analyses. Our pilot studies with LMGA-202 demonstrated the feasibility of using LMGA to simultaneously analyze many mammalian GBPs, lectins, recombinant anti-glycan antibodies, and natural antiglycan antibodies in serum/plasma. This platform is capable of analyzing up to 500 glycans in a single assay for 1020 samples per day per technician. We have successfully demonstrated that LMGA has very high sensitivity and specificity, is cost-effective and flexible in glycan composition, has a rapid turn-around time, and requires small sample volume. These attributes render the platform accessible by all biologists and an excellent choice for clinical testing. The first major goal of this U01 is to create the second generation of LMGA that will comprise at least 1000 glycans covering the diverse glycospace (LMGA-1K). The second major goal is to make LMGA less complex and more affordable via streamlining the procedures and to make the technology accessible to all biologists with interest in glycobiology through four complimentary approaches: a) provide core services for custom samples including lectins, GBPs, antiglycan antibodies, natural antiglycan antibodies in serum/plasma samples as well as cells and microbes using our high throughput and high content LMGA infrastructure; b) conjugation and testing of custom glycans against their GBPs; c) provide our ready-to-use glycan beads for others to use in their own laboratories; and d) develop and provide a standard operation protocol (SOP), QC reagents, bioinformatics tools, training and technical assistance, and a quality evaluation program so that other users can establish the LMGA platform in their own laboratories."
"9301422","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT ? Research Education Component (REC) The overall goal of the Research Education Component (REC) is to develop the next generation of leaders in integrating basic science and clinical insights into interventions promoting reserve and resilience in late life. To accomplish this we build upon strong existing training programs in Geroscience and Biology of Aging to fill key gaps in aging research education. Specifically, the REC will coordinate delivery of aging research curriculum to early investigators across the institution (Aim 1) promoting basic and clinical science integration in reserve and resilience across the lifespan (Research Colloquia on Reserve and Resilience, Data Integration Working Group), and new interventions that support reserve and resilience in diverse populations of older adults (Intervention Development in Elderly Adults Workshop, Disparities Research Curriculum, Pilot Studies Workshop). We utilize an existing infrastructure linking scholars across the 9 funded career development programs at Duke to enhance the impact of the curriculum. Second, accessing a strong pipeline of talented early investigators, we provide individualized aging research mentorship (Aim 2) by offering mentored research experiences and professional development to up to 5 select ?Pepper Scholars? each year. Scholars create individualized professional development plans and are supported by a carefully selected mentorship team including at least 2 OAIC Core faculty. They complete research training which may include coursework, professional development workshops, or research technique tutorials from Core faculty. Regular presentation of their work in the Data Integration Working Group is mandated in order to promote basic and clinical science integration. Pepper Scholars receive salary, project, and/or professional development plan support from the OAIC. Finally, the REC is responsible for evaluating the effectiveness of aging research education across the Duke OAIC (Aim 3). Guided by educators in the Aging Center with nationally recognized expertise in curriculum development and evaluation, the REC will measure the impact of OAIC programs on Scholars' career progression using innovative evaluation methods such as nominal group sessions. Our ability to leverage institutional resources will markedly enhance the impact of the REC program. We have established a close partnership with the Duke Clinical Translational Science Award Center (CTSA) KL2 program to enhance scholar recruitment, share curriculum and resources; the Duke OAIC REC and CTSA share the same co-leader and project director to facilitate interactions. The School of Medicine offers excellent professional development programs, research leadership training, and grant-writing education and support services that will be utilized by our scholars. The support of the REC program by Duke's Leaders is demonstrated by the commitment for matching funds for REC scholars by the School of Medicine Dean and the Department of Medicine Chair, and the funding of the REC-initiated Colloquia on Reserve and Resilience by the School of Medicine Dean."
"9364419","Project Summary The identification of novel susceptibility genes for complex diseases like COPD could transform our understanding of disease pathophysiology and provide new targets for treatment. The primary goals of this project are to identify the functional genetic variants within five well-established COPD GWAS loci; to identify the key genes influenced by these functional variants; and to assess the impact of these key genes and functional genetic variants on COPD pathogenesis. In recent collaborative GWAS through the International COPD Genetics Consortium, we found 22 genomic loci associated with COPD at genome-wide significance. We will focus our studies in this proposal on five of these COPD GWAS loci that include multiple candidate genes and for which a likely functional variant has not been identified. We hypothesize that an integrated approach that utilizes whole genome sequencing for fine mapping, gene expression data, bioinformatic approaches, and new laboratory assessments will enable the identification of the key genes and functional variants within these five COPD GWAS loci. Moreover, we hypothesize that focused cell-based studies of these key genes and their functional variants will provide novel insights into COPD pathogenesis. To address these hypotheses, we will start by identifying functional variants within these five loci using massively parallel reporter assays in multiple cell types, bioinformatic approaches with public and recently generated Omics data, and genetic association analysis. We will then determine which gene or genes are influenced by these functional variants by performing chromosome conformation capture (4C-Seq), confirming the regulatory effects of the functional variants on the endogenous promoter of the implicated gene, and demonstrating effects on gene expression of the implicated gene by gene editing the regulatory region using CRISP-Cas9 approaches. Finally, we will use cellular models to determine the effects of inactivating the key gene and its functional variants on COPD-related read-outs of cell death, apoptosis, and cell activation. To accomplish these goals, a unique and highly integrated approach combining genetic association analysis, molecular studies of regulatory elements, and functional cell-based assays has been developed that will likely provide important insights into COPD pathogenesis."
"9388782","Autophagy is a major mechanism of degradation of damaged mitochondria. Without elimination of damaged mitochondria, depolarized mitochondria and reactive oxygen species (ROS) rapidly affect healthy mitochondria, leading to wide-spread mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. Understanding how damaged mitochondria are removed will provide a key to achieving healthier mitochondria in cardiomyocytes (CMs) and developing novel treatments for heart failure. Although it is believed that damaged mitochondria are degraded primarily by Pink1-Parkin-mediated mitophagy, we have discovered that CMs degrade mitochondria through an Atg7-independent and Ulk1-dependent form of autophagy that is homologous to the ?alternative? autophagy previously reported by Nishida, and that this form of autophagy plays a significant role in the elimination of damaged mitochondria in response to starvation. However, neither the molecular mechanism nor the functional significance of mitophagy mediated through alternative autophagy has been clearly established in CMs yet. Thus, the goal of this project is to demonstrate the functional significance of alternative autophagy in eliminating damaged mitochondria in the heart in response to relevant stresses and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Hypothesis 1: In response to myocardial ischemia, the heart activates Atg7- independent/Ulk1-dependent alternative autophagy, which plays an essential role in mediating the clearance of damaged mitochondria and protects the heart from myocardial ischemia. Hypothesis 2: Ulk1 phosphorylated at Ser555 acts as a scaffold to induce Rab9 interaction for autophagosome formation and phosphorylation of Drp1 at Ser616 for mitochondrial fission, both of which are important in mediating mitochondrial autophagy in response to myocardial ischemia. We will: Aim 1: Demonstrate that the atg7-independent and ulk1-dependent alternative autophagy is activated by myocardial ischemia. Evaluate whether alternative autophagy protects the heart during myocardial ischemia. To this end, we will use cardiac-specific atg7- and ulk1-knockout mice, electron microscopy, specific reporters of alternative autophagy and mitochondrial autophagy, and functional analyses of mitochondria. We will show that damaged mitochondria are degraded primarily through alternative autophagy during myocardial ischemia. Aim 2: Evaluate whether phosphorylation of Ulk1 at Ser555 plays an essential role in mediating alternative autophagy and cardioprotection during myocardial ischemia by stimulating interaction with Rab9 and Ser616-phosphorylated Drp1. To this end, we will use loss-of-function and knock-in mouse models and unique and reliable reporters for alternative autophagy and lysosomal degradation of mitochondria. The knowledge obtained from this aim should lead to development of specific interventions to modulate mitophagy during myocardial ischemia. In summary, our study will demonstrate that alternative autophagy is a novel and predominant mechanism of mitochondrial degradation, which is essential for the maintenance of mitochondrial quality in the heart during ischemia."
"9280422","SUMMARY (PROJECT 3) Recent therapeutic advances have led to incremental improvement in response rates and survival in multiple myeloma. Unfortunately, the disease remains mostly incurable. Anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor redirected T cells have been particularly successful in other B-cell malignancies; CD19 is rarely expressed on the malignant plasma cell, though CD19 may be present on rare putative myeloma precursor cells. The B Cell Maturation Antigen, BCMA, is commonly present on neoplastic plasma cells but may not be on the earliest precursors or resistant clones. In patients with advanced multiple myeloma we have observed potent anti- myeloma responses with CAR T cells directed against BCMA (BCMA-CAR) and prolonged responses after CTL019. The depth and durability of these responses are promising, but have varied, and not all patients have had clinical benefit. Treatment failures have been observed in CD19 expressing malignancies such as ALL, CLL and NHL and a number of resistance mechanisms have been observed. In this Project we seek to determine the particular resistance mechanisms that limit CAR T cell therapy for myeloma and develop strategies to overcome them. This will be accomplished in three specific aims. In Aim 1 the frequency and functional clonogenicity of clonotypic B cells will be determined from samples derived from patients treated with CTL019 and BCMA-CAR and correlated with clinical outcome. In Aim 2, we seek to target both early precursors and more differentiated malignant cells to completely eliminate the malignant clone. The feasibility and safety of combining CTL019 and BCMA-CAR will be tested in a clinical trial of patients with advanced myeloma. The degree of depletion of malignant clones and comparison of these clinical results to monotherapy will be assessed. The combined results of Aim 1 and 2 will guide future trials of dual-CAR therapy. In Aim 3 we seek to invent a better anti-myeloma CAR T cell. Detailed immunophenotyping and functional assays of CAR T cells and the tumor environment from samples derived from patients treated on the CAR T trials will be made. These studies will guide the construction of new BCMA-CARs that utilize CRISPR gene-editing to knock-out the most relevant immune checkpoint molecules. This research will be significant because it is aimed at eliminating the myeloma cell of origin and be potentially curative. The innovation of the proposed research lies not just in targeting an antigen commonly on the tumor cell (BCMA) but in addition targeting a second antigen (CD19) on the malignant precursors. The knowledge gained by this project will advance the cellular immunotherapy field."
"9310831","PROJECT SUMMARY The heterogeneity of genetic etiology and the corresponding neural complexity of schizophrenia have rendered the task of understanding disease pathophysiology and developing new improved treatments rather inauspicious. In light of this complexity there is need to identify convergent molecular and neural substrates that can serve as entry points to prevent or reverse disease progression. Along the same lines, identification of mutations or variants that confer protection against disease by disabling protein function via loss-of-function (LoF) effects, akin to those of a therapeutic agent, hold great promise for devising therapeutic schemes to restore or prevent some or all of disease symptoms. During the first iteration of this grant, we characterized the microRNA dysregulation in a model of the 22q11.2 deletion, one of the strongest genetic risk factor for schizophrenia [Df(16)A+/- mice]. We found that postnatal brain upregulation of Mirta22/Emc10, an inhibitor of neuronal maturation, represents the major transcriptional effect of the 22q11.2-associated microRNA dysregulation. Mice where the Df16(A) deficiency is combined with a LoF Mirta22 allele show a profound rescue of core SCZ-related deficits such as sensorimotor gating deficits, working and social memory deficits, as well as several of the underlying synaptic and cellular deficits. Thus several key disease alterations observed in Df(16)A+/? mice can be attributed to the abnormally sustained inhibitory influence of elevated Mirta22 levels. Building on these findings, this competitive renewal aims to elucidate further the nature of neural substrates underlying the protective influences of Mirta22 LoF mutations, compare the effects of normalizing Mirta22 levels during neonatal, adolescent and adult time periods using conditional genetic manipulations in mouse models (including the use of new therapeutic modalities of translatable value) and determine the relevance of our mouse results in human disease neurons. Determining when during the lifespan Mirta22 normalization is most effective at reversing disease phenotypes will be crucial for determining its potential use as a therapeutic target. !"
"9324080","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Significance: Pediatric patients with pulmonary artery stenosis face treatment options with significant limitations. For example, metal stents are limited by long-term interference with natural vessel growth. Patients implanted with metal stents are subject to multiple hospital admissions for interventional stent expansions, often requiring fracture of the stent and open- heart surgery for removal. As such, there is an emergent need for pediatric-specific devices for this underserved population. Approach: In response to a solicitation from NHLBI, 480 Biomedical developed a self- expanding, bioresorbable stent to treat pulmonary artery stenosis under a Fast-Track SBIR. Through the Fast-Track project, promising animal results were achieved through the device resorption period, while in growing vessels. On the strength of these Fast-Track data, we raised $1.2M of funding from Broadview Ventures. This Phase IIB SBIR application will enable advancement of this product towards commercialization application. In this project, first-in- human experience with this innovative device will be achieved. During Year 1, current bench and animal data will be supplemented to create a data package to enable submission of an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) for an Early Feasibility Study (EFS). This accomplishment will enable enrollment of clinical subjects during Year 2. Year 3 will be focused on 12mo follow-up in the EFS, and along with an extensive package of bench and pre-clinical data, this human data will be submitted to the FDA for marketing clearance. This project represents an important step in the commercialization of a therapy that has the potential to be a game-changer for pediatric patients with pulmonary artery stenosis. Innovation: 480 Biomedical's novel stent couples full bioresorption with self-expansion: two features that are ideal for the pediatric population. This combination of properties is achieved through our unique composite design. By utilizing a strong base braid coated with a proprietary elastomer, we can achieve properties that are similar to metal in a fully resorbable design. The self-expansion of this design provides the added benefit of enabling the stent to maintain apposition with the vessel wall as a pediatric patient grows. The fast, yet safe, resorption characteristics of the design will enable the device to grow with the vessel without impeding early intervention, if required."
"9518198","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to take advantage of a unique opportunity to study cognition and its relation to other domains in a large untreated sample of individuals with psychosis (IWP), within an ethically appropriate context that is unlikely to continue to be available. After the onset of psychosis, studies of cognition in treated IWP suggest persisting deficits in many SCZ patients; these are present in bipolar affective psychoses to a somewhat lesser extent, indicating a continuum of severity in psychosis. To address this, we propose to study cognition among a large sample (n=500) of completely untreated IWP, assessed prior to AP treatment, within Ningxia Province who span a wide age range (21 to 65) and are community sampled. Ningxia is among the most poor and remote provinces in China, where the 686 Program has not fully penetrated but where identification of untreated cases is increasing. A community sampled comparison group of treated IWP's (n=500) (matched on locale, gender, age, and duration of illness) will also be recruited. Our goal is to illuminate the natural course of cognition and its relation to symptoms and functioning, in the absence of medication effects. We possess an unprecedented opportunity to do so within the 686 national treatment program. Our multidisciplinary research team is comprised of world-recognized experts from the fields of epidemiology, clinical psychology, and psychiatry. Building upon a history of successful collaborations, each investigator brings extensive capacity-building experience to execute this challenging project. A major goal is also to train a new cohort of investigators in Ningxia Province to increase capacity to intervene with untreated psychosis, thus serving as a model for scale-up for the 686 program."

NECN investigators have first-authored all 3 of the most highly-cited CTN publications and all 4 CTN publications cited most often per year.  The overarching goal of the NECN is to develop effective and sustainable interventions for substance use disorders that can be delivered in multiple healthcare settings, addressing substance use in all its diversity. Achieving this goal will entail 1) building on single-site efficacy trials to conduct multi-site effectivenes studies of promising interventions; 2) improving interventions with promising but modest results to date; and 3) developing innovative approaches for prevalent problems with no clearly established standard of care, or with suboptimal results in early studies (e.g., screening and brief intervention for drug use in primary care).  To address these goals, the NECN has added 1) local, regional, and national hospital-based and primary care networks that cover millions of individuals, and 2) investigators from 7 New England universities who have conducted seminal work in addiction medicine and innovative technology (Drs. Fiellin, Higgins, Marsch, O'Connor, Saitz, Samet). The NECN research agenda demonstrates its capacity to develop and implement novel approaches to improve treatment for substance users wherever they contact the healthcare system.  Proposed studies build on the previous work of NECN investigators and include, among others: 1. Screening and brief intervention (SBI) vs. repeated BIs vs. computer-based cognitive-behavioral therapy  for risky drug use in primary care (Saitz, Carroll); 2. Financial incentives for pregnant smokers in obstetrical practice (Higgins); 3. Buprenorphine initiation in the emergency department vs. facilitated referral for opioid dependent patients  (Fiellin, D'Onofrio); and 4. Use of peer navigators to enhance treatment retention among opioid dependent patients started on buprenorphine during hospitalization (Liebschutz, Stein)."
"9346012","Abstract As older adults make up a growing share of the population, the prevalence of dementia will likely increase, but the magnitude of the increase will depend on the course of age-specific rates. Most projections of Alzheimer's disease and dementia assume that age-specific prevalence rates do not change and that population aging alone will drive dementia prevalence trends. There is some recent evidence, however, that age-specific prevalence may be declining Europe and possibly in the United States. This study will use data from the Health and Retirement Study to estimate the trajectory of dementia prevalence and to examine risk factors. Since 1992, the HRS has surveyed biennially a panel of Americans over age 50, including about 8000 over 70. Data collected include assessments of cognition, health, socioeconomic status, family background, and now genetic information and biomarkers. A sub-study in the early 2000s administered an in-depth cognitive assessment covering dementia to 856 HRS respondents, and now a new sub-study to begin in 2016 will assess dementia status in a subsample of about 3000. This study has five specific aims. First, it will estimate the age-adjusted prevalence of dementia from 1998 to 2016 in the population over age 70 based on an improved model of dementia probability, including the use of genetic information; it will also estimate age-adjusted trends in dementia incidence (onset) and dementia mortality. Second, it will analyze subpopulations such as by gender or by race/ethnicity to document differences in dementia risk by groups. It will test whether any such differences can be explained by differences in exposure to risk factors such as diabetes or education and whether group-specific trends in risk factors affect group-specific trends in dementia. Third, where risk factors are found to be associated with dementia prevalence, the study will seek to determine whether these associations reflect causality. Fourth, using the models of the probability of dementia, the evidence about causality, and forecasts of risk factors, the study will predict dementia prevalence for the population and for important subpopulations to 2040. Fifth, the study will forecast the use and availability of informal care, e.g., care by family members, and how it will affect nursing home use and costs."
"9383068","Abstract Pituitary gland dysfunction affects growth, fertility, the stress response, and many other physiological functions. Hypopituitarism can result from congenital defects in organ development (about 1/4000 births) and from pituitary adenomas, which are among the most common type of intracranial tumor. Treatment involves hormone replacement therapy, which can involve daily injections of recombinant growth hormone at great expense per patient. Some adenomas respond to pharmacological therapy, while others are recurrent, potentially causing disfigurement, multiple trans-sphenoidal surgeries, and can result in blindness and death. Genetically engineered mice have been used to identify the roles of several transcription factors and signaling molecules in differentiation, and there is excellent correspondence to human pituitary disorders. In previous years of this grant we used mouse mutants to define the roles of several transcription factors (PITX2, GATA2, FOXL2, LHX3, LHX4 and ISL1) and signaling pathways (BMP, FGF, WNT) in pituitary development and disease. We also determined how the transcription factor mutations affected expression of cell cycle regulators to cause pituitary hypoplasia, and identified a novel gene that drives cell proliferation in a mouse model of thyrotrope adenoma. The long-term goal of this research is to improve diagnosis and therapy for people with genetic or acquired pituitary disease by increasing our fundamental understanding of how pituitary growth and cell specification are orchestrated at the molecular level. The overall objectives of this application are: to define the roles of two key transcription factors, Isl1 and Zeb2, in pituitary development and disease, and to employ an unbiased approach to identify novel transcription factors, lncRNA and chromatin changes that drive pituitary thyrotrope cell fate and establishment of robust hormone production. We generated the first model of Rathke's cleft cysts by deleting Isl1 in pituitary development, and we have evidence that this leads to misregulation of pituitary stem cells and formation of adenomas. We also show that Zeb2 is necessary to drive an epithelial to mesenchymal-like transition (EMT) in pituitary stem cell cultures. The proposed research uses up to date approaches for analysis of Isl1 and Zeb2. It is innovative because it uses an unbiased approach to discovering new factors and pathways, including exploring the role of noncoding RNAs, which is a relatively new area of investigation, and it uses state of the art genomic analysis techniques to identify regulatory regions of genes, which are likely sites of mutations in patients with hypopituitarism or adenoma risk factors. This research will be significant because it will provide fundamental information about the molecular mechanisms of formation of pituitary cysts and adenomas, the regulation of EMT, and it will establish the regulatory mechanisms underlying thyrotrope fate. This information will contribute to identification of the basis for human pituitary diseases including congenital hormone deficiencies and adenomas."

"9521830","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this exploratory R21 grant is to investigate the concept that GM-CSF & IL-17 dual producing CD8+ T cells are necessary for vaccine-induced immunity against respiratory fungal infections. Fungal infections in immunocompromised patients, especially AIDS patients, have skyrocketed. CD4+ T cells are primary effectors against fungal infections. Hence, it is not surprising that both opportunistic an primary fungal infections occur mainly in CD4+ T-cell deficient subjects. However, our previous studies in a mouse model of vaccine-induced fungal immunity that lack CD4+ T cells have shown that memory CD8+ T-cells are maintained without apparent loss of numbers or functions, i.e., cytokine production, suggesting a potential avenue in exploiting residual immunity by CD8+ T cells in at risk individuals. Further, we showed that the cytokines, especially GM-CSF and IL-17, derived from memory CD8+ T cells, are necessary to mediate the fungal immunity, although we do not know the development and function of GM-CSF+IL-17A+ T-cells. While multi-cytokine producing memory CD8+ T cells are desired in vaccine-induced immunity against pathogens including in respiratory infections, recent studies in other models have underpinned the pathogenic role of GM-CSF+ Th17 cells during central nervous system inflammations. Thus, it is essential to understand whether vaccine-induced `pathogenic (GM-CSF+)' Th17 or Tc17 cells mediate effective immunity or exuberant responses leading to immunopathology during the respiratory fungal infections. Filling this gap would aid in our understanding in designing vaccines and/or adjuvants against infections and mitigate immunopathology during infections. The goal of this exploratory R21 proposal is to delineate the development, maintenance and function of GM-CSF+ Tc17 cells during pulmonary fungal infections. We hypothesize that GM-CSF+ Tc17 cells are necessary for effective anti-fungal immunity where, IL-1 beta signaling is required for their generation and recall into the lungs during pulmonary infections, whereas IL-23 is required to maintain their phenotype and also acts as `rheostat' to regulate GM-CSF+ Tc17 cell functions during pulmonary infections thus balancing immunity and immunopathology. Objectives of our present proposal are: (i) to dissect the role of GM-CSF+ Tc17 cells in vaccine-induced immunity during pulmonary fungal infections; (ii) to define the dynamic and distinct roles of IL- 1beta and IL-23 for generation, maintenance, and recall responses of GM-CSF+ Tc17 cells during vaccine- induced fungal immunity; (iii) to delineate dynamics of IL-23 during pulmonary infection in immunity and immunopathology.  Our work will unravel the role of GM-CSF+IL-17+ T cells in immunity against fungal infections and dissect the cytokine requirements for their generation and memory homeostasis in a vaccine model."
"9348486","This revised Phase I SBIR proposal aims at developing a topical formulation of siRNA-nanoparticle that delivers siRNA to treat skin fibrosis. Our platform has inherent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, further benefitting the treatment of skin fibrosis for which there is no effective treatment. Upon completion, the platform will have broad applicability since siRNA can be designed to knock down any gene responsible for other diseases, such as psoriasis, skin disorders, and skin cancers. Our patent-pending delivery platform is a hybrid of mesoporous silica nanoparticles and co-polymer coating, which is more effective and safer than the siRNA-polyplex counterpart. Preliminary data following intradermal injection of the siRNA-NP shows promising efficacy for treating skin fibrosis in mice. A topical formulation to be developed in this Phase I proposal will significantly reduce patient burden and thus is an integral step towards clinical translation of this technology. Aim 1: We will screen appropriate vehicles for a topical siRNA-NP formulation to maximize penetration to epidermis and dermis and siRNA knockdown efficacy in a 3D human skin model. Aim 2: We will apply the optimized topical formulation to deliver siRNA against HSP47 to treat fibrosis in a 3D human skin model and benchmark against a current treatment (corticosteroid). Aim 3: Ultrasound and targeting agent (anti-EGFR antibody) will be applied on the nanoparticle to enhance penetration and cellular uptake, potentially leading to greater treatment efficacy, which will be validated in in vivo mouse study. Aim 4: Preliminary toxicity studies in cell lines, 3D human skin, and mice will be performed. The Go/No-go criteria include 1) effective topical formulation that can penetrate both epidermis and dermis layers, 2) >70% knock-down of target (HSP47) genes, 3) reduction of anti-fibrotic markers (NOX4, ?-SMA, COL I), and dermal thickness to the baseline level, 4) <15% non-specific cell death, and 5) more favorable safety and efficacy profile than the topical corticosteroid counterpart. This project is led by PDX Pharmaceuticals, LLC, a spin-off company from Biomedical Engineering Department at OHSU. The team consists of Ngamcherdtrakul, PhD, the lead developer of the siRNA- nanoparticle platform as the contact PI and Yantasee, PhD, MBA, Associate Professor at the BME of OHSU, and Oregon Nanomedicine Signature Researcher as OHSU's PI.

"9330473","Summary The overall goal of the U19 proposal is to combine kidney and islet transplantation with nonmyeloablative hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) to achieve immune tolerance to the donor tissues. We will use a the cynomolgus monkey model to develop this approach for deceased and living donor scenarios, using expanded polyclonal and donor-specific recipient regulatory T cells respectively, in Projects 1 and 2. We hypothesize that tolerance will involve both expansion and induction of donor-specific regulatory T cells and deletion of donor- specific effector T cells. A key to development of this procedure will be the tools to identify and track these donor-specific T cells. We previously developed such a method in humans. Core B will extend this technology to cynomolgus monkeys (cyno) and apply the assay to support Projects 1 and 2. Specifically, Core B will follow the same development pipeline we have used for human and mouse to develop a T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing assay for cyno. Since TCRs rearrange somatically with massive diversity, each TCR is nearly unique. This allows us to track hundreds of thousands of T cell clones over time and between tissues by their TCR sequence. We leverage with technology by first isolating donor-specific T cells through a mixed lymphocyte reaction (explicitly stimulating T cells that are specific to the donor tissue). The clones in these expanded donor- reactive CD4 and CD8 T cells are compared to those in sorted, unstimulated functional subsets, including effector and regulatory T cells, and the expanded sequences are identified as belonging to the donor-reactive subset. We will validate this assay in cynomolgus monkeys receiving allotransplants and optimize methods .for defining donor-reactive effector and regulatory T cell clones. Timed, sorted T cell DNA samples from infused Tregs, peripheral blood and graft-infiltrating lymphocytes as well as DNA from biopsy specimens and urine pellets from transplanted cyno monkeys in Projects 1 and 2 will be sent to Core B, where the assay will be applied. Over time, we will monitor the clonal expansion and contraction of these T cell subsets in blood, tissue, and urine pellets to identify mechanisms of immune tolerance in this preclinical model."
"9354673","Daily use of marijuana use is increasingly common in persons living with HIV (PLWH). In Florida, which continues to have one of the highest rates of HIV incidence and prevalence in the US, voters are expected to pass an amendment to legalize medical marijuana for use by PLWH in late 2016. While there is some evidence that marijuana can improve HIV-related symptoms, there is almost no existing evidence regarding the long- term health effects of marijuana in PLWH. Marijuana, which contains a number of different cannabinoid products, could affect HIV health outcomes via both behavioral mechanisms (e.g. medication adherence, motivation) and biological mechanisms (e.g. anti-inflammatory, viral suppression). The overarching goals of this study are to obtain evidence regarding the influence of marijuana on major health outcomes and behavior in PLWH in order to help guide clinical recommendations and identify risk factors for consequences. We are especially interested in the relationship of marijuana to novel aspects of cognitive function (e.g. motivation, intention, planning) and to systemic inflammation. To accomplish these research goals, we propose a new, longitudinal cohort of 480 PLWH (160 regular marijuana users, 160 occasional marijuana users, and 160 non- users). We will obtain detailed marijuana assessments, including cannabis biomarkers, together with repeated measures of cognition, systemic inflammation, and HIV care engagement and health outcomes. Our Specific Aims are: 1) To prospectively determine the association of daily and occasional marijuana use with HIV care engagement, viral suppression, and HIV disease progression; 2) to prospectively determine the association of past and current marijuana use with cognitive function, motivation, and planning; and 3) to prospectively determine the association of chronic marijuana use with cytokine markers of chronic inflammation. For each of these aims, we will conduct subgroup analyses to explore whether these relationships vary by individual characteristics such as gender and age (>50 vs. <50), and by characteristics of past and current marijuana use, including cannabis use disorder. This will be the largest prospective cohort study focused on the health effects of marijuana in PLWH. The findings will inform HIV treatment providers and patients who are considering marijuana to manage HIV-related symptoms or HIV disease itself, and will identify patterns of marijuana use that are most strongly associated with the incidence of substance use disorders. Our research team is multidisciplinary, our infrastructure is in place, and our preliminary data support the need for this project. The research is consistent with current NIH HIV research priorities to reduce HIV transmission (by successful treatment and viral suppression) and to reduce the onset of HIV-related comorbidities, including cognitive dysfunction."
"9409994","ABSTRACT Thyroid dysfunction is among the most common morbidities of the neonatal period and can result in permanent cognitive disability and other serious complications if not rapidly identified and treated. While newborn thyroid screening in state public health laboratories has revolutionized the identification of children with severe congenital primary hypothyroidism, this screening does not effectively identify several other common neonatal disorders of thyroid function that may result from preterm birth or maternal hyperthyroidism. Major barriers to comprehensive thyroid testing in newborns currently include the relatively large volume of blood needed for multiple tests (>2 mL), long assay turn-around times and a need for repeated testing to establish an appropriate treatment plan. These limitations are further complicated by the lack of clear consensus guidelines for identification and treatment of hypothyroidism in preterm newborns. We propose to develop a novel digital microfluidic system (FINDER) for rapid, near patient thyroid testing in newborns using microliter volumes of whole blood. Through this Fast-Track SBIR mechanism, we will develop a multiplexed panel of assays to measure total T3, free T4, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyrotropin receptor antibody (TRAB) in whole blood, with an anticipated run time of less than 45 minutes. The FINDER thyroid system will allow clinicians: to (a) rapidly identify infants with true central or primary hypothyroidism; (b) differentiate central hypothyroidism (which requires treatment) from the more common hypothyroxinemia of prematurity; (c) perform repeated thyroid function testing in blood volume-limited neonates; and (d) rapidly identify neonates with Graves disease as a consequence of maternal hyperthyroidism. Phase I Specific Aims include: 1) develop automated immunoassays for T3, free T4, TSH and TRAB on the digital microfluidic cartridge; 2) perform preliminary analytical validations of each assay; and 3) demonstrate preliminary feasibility of the individual assays on discarded serum samples. The key milestone for progression to Phase II will be the successful completion of all assays on-cartridge with high reliability and precision. Phase II Specific Aims are: 1) optimize reagent formulations for on-cartridge drying and storage; 2) multiplex all assays to perform simultaneously on the same cartridge using whole blood samples and perform analytical validations using dried reagents and whole blood samples; and 3) preliminary clinical validation of the complete thyroid testing panel using standard reference tests at Duke Clinical Laboratory as a comparison. At the conclusion of Phase II, we will have a commercializable product for rapid, efficient and accurate thyroid testing in high-risk newborns using microliter volumes of whole blood. We will seek FDA approval of the final product, which will initially be marketed for use in pediatric patients in U.S. hospitals, with a potential future market towards other patients who may benefit from the innovative features of the platform."
"9205988","Abstract DESCRIPTION: It is estimated that over 500,000 bone grafting procedures are performed each year in the United States with over 50% of them being done in the setting of spine fusions, which is one of the toughest clinical bone healing environments. Orthopaedic surgical treatment of these problems typically requires bone grafting, yet iliac crest bone graft may fail to heal in 25-45% of patients. Numerous bone substitutes, electrical stimulation, and stem cells have failed to show sufficient potency to initiate bone healing. The first recombinant bone morphogenetic protein (rhBMP-2) was approved in 2002 and represented a major advance by demonstrating unprecedented bone healing potential. Unfortunately, the high dose made routine use of rhBMP-2 economically unfeasible in most bone healing situations and local side effects (swelling, hematoma, inflammation, transient bone resorption) along with the possibility of increased cancer risk have further slowed its adoption. This proposal will describe a novel approach to initiate local bone formation without the use of supra-physiologic doses of recombinant BMPs or the use of exogenous stem cells. RESEARCH PLAN: In this proposal, we provide a well-designed process for identifying and screening repurposed drugs for the clinical challenge of spine fusion. Through a computerized drug design and screening process we identified a family of small molecules which are capable of displacing a repressor (FKBP12) off the BMP-receptor, thereby enabling local activation of the bone formation cascade. Tacrolimus and rapamycin are already FDA-approved as safe local and systemic anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressant drugs, making them ideal to be repurposed as local osteogenic agents. The success of this work will provide profound evidence that an already FDA-approved immunosuppressant small molecule may be applied towards a new indication, bone regeneration for spine fusion. SPECIFIC AIMS: Aim 1: Target validation of tacrolimus- and rapamycin-osteoinduction in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is via activation of the BMP receptor. Aim 2: Local delivery of tacrolimus or rapamycin induces dose-dependent in vivo bone formation. Aim 3: Tacrolimus or rapamycin can induce bone fusion in a clinically relevant, orthotopic spine fusion rabbit model. METHODS: The first aim will expand on preliminary data and validate the binding of the small molecules to the target region of the BMP receptor. Aim 2 will establish a therapeutic dose range for induction of ectopic bone by the small molecules and test the effects of a compression resistant nanofiber mesh to enhance retention at the site of delivery and improve bone formation. The third aim will test one-time local administration of the small molecules in a well-established pre-clinical model rabbit spine fusion (initiating new bone formation)."

"9376574","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Poor reading comprehension is a longstanding problem in the U.S. that has not improved over the past two decades. Poor reading comprehension causes children to struggle academically, to drop out of school, to earn less over their lifetime, and puts them at high risk for poor health outcomes (National Academy of Sciences, 2004). Our long-term goal is to develop methods for preventing and treating reading comprehension problems by understanding the changing structure of reading across development and the cognitive, psychological, and ecological mechanisms that contribute to reading comprehension outcomes. We will continue our longitudinal study of reading comprehension, conducted by the Language and Reading Research Consortium (LARRC), with two groups of children - those who entered preschool speaking primarily English and those who entered preschool as Spanish-English dual-language learners. We will also recruit new groups of 6th and 10th grade monolingual English and Spanish-English bilingual students for cross-sectional studies. We will address the following specific aims: (1) Determine which language, cognitive, and pre-reading skills in preschool and kindergarten, or growth in these skills from preschool to kindergarten, most accurately predicts reading comprehension in grade 6; (2) Determine whether there are children with late emerging reading comprehension problems in grade 6 and if so, whether they can be identified using language, cognitive, and pre-reading measures from PK or K; (3) Determine the factor structure for reading comprehension in grades 6 and 10 to assess whether a single-factor model of reading comprehension is sufficient or whether additional factors are required to take into account text type (i.e., narrative versus expository) and measurement type (i.e., processing versus product), and whether there are differences between grades; (4) Determine whether a new model of reading that includes multiple indicators for cognitive, psychological, and ecological factors better predicts reading comprehension in grades 6 and 10 than models with fewer factors and indicators examined in prior literature.; and (5) Determine whether findings for Aims 1-4 differ for children who entered preschool speaking English and children who entered preschool as Spanish-English dual-language learners.  This project is innovative in the length of time we follow students (preschool through grade 6), the breadth and depth of cognitive, psychological, and ecological skills assessed, and the study of both English and Spanish-English bilingual students using both longitudinal and cross-sectional samples. Results will positively impact our ability to identify children at risk for poor reading comprehension, even before they learn to read, and will provide a sound basis for the development and testing of reading comprehension assessments, curricula, and interventions for older students and DLLs."
"9327291","PROJECT SUMMARY Obese asthma represents an important clinical problem due to the growing number of affected patients worldwide, and their disease severity which is poorly controlled with existing medications. Changes in metabolism, and associated changes in redox homeostasis are believed to contribute to obesity-associated diseases. This project addresses whether S-glutathionylation chemistry (PSSG, a redox-based modification of protein cysteine residues involving conjugation with glutathione) contributes to the pathogenesis of obese allergic asthma. We have discovered a close association between PSSG chemistry and glycolysis in lungs from mice with house dust mite (HDM)-induced allergic airways disease, and in primary nasal epithelial cells from asthmatics. Redox proteomics identified he glycolytic enzyme, pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) as an important target for S-glutathionylation. PKM2 had recently been implicated in the augmentation of pro-inflammatory responses. Importantly, both PSSG and glycolysis were increased in settings of obesity, suggesting that PSSG and linked alterations in glycolysis may be a key feature of obese allergic asthma. These findings led us to hypothesize that glycolysis is a critical process that promotes allergic airways disease, and that this process is enhanced by S-glutathionylation of the glycolytic enzyme PKM2 (PKM2-SSG). We furthermore hypothesize that these processes are augmented in obese asthmatic individuals compared to lean allergic asthmatics. Avenues to inhibit glutathione S-transferase P (GSTP, a catalyst of S-glutathionylation) or to promote de-glutathionylation of PKM2 by increasing expression of the de-glutathionylating enzyme, glutaredoxin-1 (GLRX), are anticipated to attenuate glycolytic reprogramming and to decrease airways disease in obese allergic asthmatics. In Specific Aim #1 we will determine the impact of genetic ablation or inhibition of GSTP in decreasing glycolysis in mice house dust mite (HDM)- diet induced obesity (DIO)- mediated lung disease, and in nasal epithelial cells from lean and obese allergic asthmatics. In Specific Aim #2 we propose to assess the impact of modulation of GLRX in lung tissues in order to attenuate PSSG, PKM2-SSG, and glycolysis in settings of lean or obese allergic airways disease. We will utilize transgenic approaches or administer recombinant GLRX directly into airways of lean or obese mice with existing allergic airways disease. Specific Aim #3 addresses the importance of pyruvate kinase M2 for lean or obese allergic airways disease. We will specifically ablate the Pkm2 gene from airway epithelial cells in mice and propose pharmacological approaches to enhance PKM2 activity in mice with existing HDM/DIO-induced allergic disease and in nasal epithelial cells derived from lean or obese healthy subjects or asthmatics. Completion of the proposed studies will provide new mechanistic insights into how S- glutathionylation facilitates glycolytic reprogramming and has the potential to offer clinically/translationally relevant strategies targeting S-glutathionylation chemistry in order to attenuate glycolysis, resultant lactate production, airways inflammation and remodeling in individuals with obese allergic asthma."
"9306706","Abstract Many subpopulations of special interest to public health, such as sex workers, are hard to survey because they are rare and would require a large number of screening interviews to generate a sufficient sample size or because they are stigmatized and unlikely to trust researchers with personal information. Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) is one of the most effective means of sampling such subpopulations, because it asks and incentivizes subpopulation members to recruit other members through their personal social networks and then weights the resultant sample to correct for biases induced by the sampling design and make inferences about univariate statistics that are, under certain conditions, generalizable to the subpopulation of interest. Hundreds of studies have been conducted using RDS, backed by over $166 million of federal funding. The basic methodology of RDS has been subjected to several methodological extensions, evaluations, and criticisms, but prior statistical developments have largely focused on improving estimators for univariate statistics (e.g., prevalence of a risk factor). We propose to extend prior methodological work on statistical estimation in RDS to develop accurate and efficient tools that will allow researchers to estimate the parameters of multivariate regression models which will enhance understandings of hard to survey subpopulations. The current practice of multivariate RDS estimation is ad hoc with researchers applying over 10 distinct approaches throughout the literature but offering little or no justification for the approach they chose. RDS methodologists have yet to establish best practices or evaluate the performance of these different approaches. We propose to perform this evaluation. By doing so, this project will enable future RDS studies to address multivariate research questions about hard to survey subpopulations, and it will add substantial value to the hundreds of RDS studies that have previously been funded and collected. The proposed project has two components that will provide guidance to researchers (and the public health community) about conducting multivariate analyses with RDS data and the tools to conduct these analyses. The first component consists of a series of simulation studies that evaluate the performance of the most popular multivariate RDS estimators. The simulation studies will be designed to explore the performance of the estimators across a range of theoretically ideal and more realistic RDS sampling scenarios as well as a diversity of network types. The second component involves the development and dissemination of software in two commonly used statistical packages (R and Stata) that implements the best performing multivariate estimators identified in the simulation studies. The data collected in RDS studies has vast untapped potential to contribute to understandings of specific risk factors in hard to survey populations and the multivariate tools we will develop as part of this proposal will help to unlock this potential.  "
"9372952","Resource for marking clones on the fly 4th chromosome For over a century, studies employing Drosophila melanogaster have resulted in significant advances in our understanding of highly conserved cellular processes and signaling systems. In the area of human health, Drosophila genetics has been an effective means for identifying disease-associated genes and for providing insights into their mechanism of action. The fourth chromosome (IV) is the final frontier for genetic analysis in Drosophila. Small and devoid of recombination IV has been largely ignored. Nevertheless, the long arm of IV contains roughly 105 genes. 55% of these genes have obvious human orthologs and 67% of the human genes have a disease association. A complete understanding of multicellularity requires the genetic analysis of mutations in these genes. Somatic and germline clones are established tools for studying the functions of lethal mutations in flies. The MARCM system for tracking clones of mutant cells he has been widely employed to study central nervous system development and adult intestinal stem cells. However, MARCM is not useable on IV due to the lack of appropriate chromosomes. As a resource for the Drosophila community whose investigators are funded by virtually all of the NIH Institutes and Centers, we propose a collaborative R21 (in response to PAR-16-141) to generate the necessary chromosomes for MARCM-IV. Our two labs are currently NIH funded for studies of TGF-? signaling and have worked together previously on the role of the Sno oncogene in TGF-? signal transduction. We will employ an innovative strategy integrating molecular methods (Crisper-Cas9) with genetics (X to autosome jumping). MARCM-IV will then be tested in studies of TGF-? signaling in the mushroom body and the enteric neurons of the larval brain. The Specific Aims of this project are: Aim1 Resource Development: To create the unique fourth chromosomes necessary for MARCM-IV. Aim2 Discovery: Proof of principal studies will utilize MARCM-IV to generate marked clones for three mutant genes. These are the TGF-? ligands activin-? and myoglianin and the Smad-interacting signal transducer dCORL (fussel in Flybase). These applications of MARCM-IV will advance our knowledge of molecular mechanisms in the TGF-? pathway, neural-glial interactions and the development/function of subesophageal neurons in the brain. The results should attract the attention of others in the Drosophila community whose interests encompass genes on IV. We will provide the MARCM-IV lines to any qualified investigator and evidence of community interest is already visible in letters appended to this proposal. Given that many of the genes on IV are conserved, new insights from MARCM-IV in flies can be readily translated into new hypotheses for normal development/physiology or diseases in humans. Looking ahead, it is likely our innovative approach can easily be expanded to an analysis of all genes on IV. The valuable community resource created by this project will be made freely available to all qualified researchers to facilitate our understanding of conserved features of developmental signaling and neurobiology impacting human health and disease.  "

Through this support, the CTMC enables IDD researchers in the DC region to pursue and investigate a variety of pediatric diseases with a focus on neurodevelopmental disorders, fetal and neonatal brain injury, and genetic diseases. The CTMC has traditionally provided light microscopy, electron microscopy and confocal microscopy services. However, due to the growing need of DC-IDD researchers for enhanced imaging resolution, the Core has acquired new instruments that allow expansion of its services to include advanced electron microscopy (EM) technologies, Multiphoton, and super resolution imaging abilities. These developments will enable imaging from nanoscale to whole tissue and embryo scale. This growth has been supplemented by the significant expansion in Core?s infrastructure, which allow to handle large datasets, and carry out analysis of large structural and functional data sets. Additional developments in the Core will significantly enhance the ability of IDD researchers to perform in vivo and ex vivo functional imaging with combined optogenetics and electrophysiology. To support this growth in the CTMC, two new Core managers have been hired, who bring their expertise in in vivo functional imaging, EM, and correlative light and EM imaging. These and other dedicated Core staff members are all practicing researchers and offer their specific expertise not only through designated Core activities, but also through collaborative projects. These abilities of the Core are further supplemented by the collaborations forged between the Core and multiple microscopy and imaging technology companies. Additionally, the Core interfaces with other DC-IDDRC Cores, including the Neurobehavioral Evaluation, Genomics and Proteomics, and Human and Animal Imaging Cores. We will use the expertise and services offered by the CTMC staff, leverage on the involvement of users affiliated with this Core, and create partnerships with microscopy companies, in order to provide the following services: 1) training researchers in microscopy-based imaging approaches, 2) assisting researchers in proper choice and use of light and EM tools for examination of cells and tissues, 3) helping develop and implement approaches for quantitative analysis of the data obtained for each project, 4) maintaining high quality of data acquisition, analysis and publication, and 5) training and educating the next generation of IDD researchers in the application of microscopy-based technologies through hands on training, education on specific technologies, and workshops. !"
"9412019","ABSTRACT Outbreaks of HIV and HCV in rural areas of the Midwest have been associated with syringe-sharing among partners injecting nonmedical prescription opioids. Illinois ranks as the third highest state in percentage increase in death rates involving synthetic opiates between 2014-2015. The southernmost 16 counties of Illinois comprise the Illinois Delta Region (IDR) and share many of the characteristics of rural areas that have experienced recent HIV epidemics. A deeper understanding of community characteristics, including transitions from oral to injection opioid use, circumstances for high-risk injection practices, and accessibility to existing and potential health-related resources will be essential to developing models of disease prevention and treatment. Partnering with state and local public health other state agencies, community based programs, local coalitions and healthcare systems, we will take a mixed analytical approach using predictive modeling, GIS analysis, qualitative and survey analysis, network methods, and infectious disease epidemiology to understand geospatial and sociocultural factors impacting health outcomes in people who inject drugs in the IDR. These data will inform evidence-based interventions to strengthen access to disease screening and linkage to care and treatment, expansion of needle exchange and naloxone overdose programs, screening and referral to substance use treatment, and telehealth capacity building for the provision of PrEP, HCV management, and medication-assisted treatment for substance use disorder. UG3 Aim 1. Determine the geographic areas in the rural Illinois Delta Region at greatest risk for opioid misuse and infectious diseases in the IDR based on disease surveillance, healthcare utilization, prescription drug monitoring, arrest and drug seizure, and resource scarcity mapping. UG3 Aim 2. Understand how sociocultural factors impact risk and health seeking behaviors, social networks, and disease transmission of people who inject drugs in high risk geographic areas identified in Aim 1. UG3 Aim 3. Integrate and apply the epidemiological, geospatial, qualitative and network data to inform expanded harm-reduction services and targeted telehealth capacity building for related clinical care. UH3 Aim 1. Expand harm reduction services including syringe services, naloxone overdose prevention, substance use treatment referral, HIV, HCV, HBV and STDs testing and linkage to care through capacity building of existing programs as well as through new local health department based harm reduction units. UH3 Aim 2. Build capacity for HCV management, PrEP, substance use screening, referral, and medication- assisted treatment through telehealth programs targeted at PWID-preferred settings. UH3 Aim 3.

"9346063","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): X-ray tricontrast imaging provides three different modes of contrast: absorption contrast (the mechanism behind how conventional medical X-ray imaging equipment images), phase contrast (which provides up to 1000X more contrast than absorption-based contrast for soft tissue), and scatter contrast (which provides information of features at dimensions smaller than the resolution of absorption and phase contrast). Access to all three contrast modes is widely considered one of the most exciting developments in modern X-ray physics, and has significant potential to change the face of biomedical imaging for early detection of cancer, osteoarthritis, and other soft tissue diseases. The recent development of Talbot-Lau interferometry, a grating- based technique that uses three gratings to achieve tricontrast imaging, has high potential to achieve tricontrast imaging in clinical use. However, there are several major limitations stemming from the use of two out of the three gratings. These two gratings are not entirely necessary and the removal of the gratings would still allow the technique to work, as long as substantial innovation is made to the source and to the detector. We propose to develop a high detective quantum efficiency (DQE) microstructured detector with good resolution to enable clinical Talbot interferometers without need of one of the two problematic gratings. The other grating may be removed by innovation on the source, for which we have also devised a proposal that has previously been submitted to the NIH and is awaiting a final funding decision (it received an outstanding impact score of 20). The proposed Phase I 6-month project is a proof-of-principle demonstration that the microstructured detector can be manufactured and would provide high detective quantum efficiency, and the proposed Phase II 24-month project would produce working prototypes of the detector."
"9383459","7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hepatitis C (HCV) is a leading cause of chronic liver disease and mortality worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently recognized the need to prevent and control HCV infection, and proposed that HCV elimination is feasible by 2030 by reducing new chronic infections by 90% and HCV-related mortality by 65%. In the U.S., elimination strategies are urgently needed that focus on persons who inject drugs (PWID), the group at most risk for acquiring and transmitting HCV infection. Despite the long-term availability of harm reduction strategies such as syringe exchange programs (SEP), opioid substitution therapies (OSTs), and behavioral counseling, HCV incidence in the U.S. is on the rise among PWID. The recent availability of all oral direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) with high reported cure rates (e.g., >90%) that can prevent liver disease progression and HCV transmission, combined with prevention and harm reduction strategies, make HCV elimination an attainable goal. However, given considerable barriers (e.g., cost of DAAs, poor linkage to care and adherence, possible reinfection, PWID lifestyle), it is essential for policy development and strategic planning to understand the factors that would most effectively promote HCV elimination among PWID. Understanding the dynamic and complex interplay of factors at the individual (e.g., risk behaviors), social (e.g., injection networks), structural (e.g., access to syringe exchange programs and opioid substitution therapies), and geographic (e.g., non-urban residence) levels is essential to improve understanding and development of HCV elimination strategies. Current models cannot account for such dynamic and complex interactions. As such we propose to develop a comprehensive, data-driven agent-based model for Hepatitis C Elimination in PWID (HepCEP) using the Chicago PWID population as a template and proof of concept that would enable policy makers to identify the most effective intervention strategies for elimination of HCV by 2030 based on the aforementioned WHO's proposed reduction estimates. The long term significance of these efforts would be to adapt the HepCEP framework to (i) model HCV transmission in the general population of Chicago and in Illinois prisons, (ii) forecast the spread of HCV in other U.S. urban and non-urban PWID populations (e.g., Albuquerque, NM), (iii) perform cost-effectiveness analyses, and (iv) assist vaccine-trial sponsors in designing and evaluating clinical trials."
"9454679","Project Summary Cerebral ischemia as a result of strokes or cardiac arrest remains one of the leading causes of death and disability in the U.S.A. It is now well accepted that mitochondria are key players in cerebral ischemic/reperfusion injury hours to days following the ischemic insult. The main goals were the elucidation of signaling pathways involved in the fate of brain mitochondria following cerebral ischemia. Studies from us and other groups, have demonstrated Protein Kinase C isozyme (PKC?) translocates to mitochondria to activate pathways of neuroprotection1,2. We have identified that PKC? acts as a signaling metabolic master regulator that alters NAD levels, mitochondrial sirtuins and cell metabolism and promotes neuroprotection against cerebral ischemia. Previous studies demonstrated the importance of NAD replenishment3 in neuroprotection against cerebral ischemia. Thus, we propose experiments to elucidate the mechanisms by which PKC? alters NAD levels in the brain and define its downstream pathways that enhance ischemic tolerance. These goals will be achieved in the following specific aims: 1) To determine if PKC? via Sirt1 promotes increases of the NAD+ biosynthetic pathway and define the role of this pathway in ischemic neuroprotection. Model: Mouse; Paradigm: Oxygen-Glucose Deprivation (OGD); 2) To determine if the PKC?/Sirt1 pathway promotes a `caloric restriction' (CR)-like bioenergetic phenotype in the brain. Model: Mouse; Paradigm: Oxygen-Glucose Deprivation (OGD), Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion (MCAo); and 3) To determine whether post-treatment with a PKC? activator can rescue the NAD+ salvage pathway and its downstream pathways following MCAo in aged rats. Model: Rat; Paradigm: MCAo."
"9325085","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cortical spreading depression (CSD) in acute brain injury, including stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and severe traumatic brain injury has significant clinical (3.2M patients/year) and economic importance (>$34B/year). A major limitation to current assessment of CSD is that it can only be observed with cortical electrodes requiring an invasive craniotomy. Thus only a small fraction of the most critically injured patient are monitored. We propose to develop a system that reliably detects CSDs with a non-invasive, scalp-mounted sensor array using direct-current electroencephalography (DC-EEG). Whereas conventional AC-coupled EEG is widely used clinically, it is not optimal for detecting the slowly moving DC-potential wave of CSD. In contrast, the underused technology of DC-coupled EEG is ideally suited for CSD detection. We aim to design, build, and validate a scalp-mounted, CSD-detection system by first optimizing the sensor array using computer simulation and creating software to process the signals and detect the CSDs. Our preliminary numerical simulations of CSD detection from the scalp agree well with the limited published data and indicate that propagation of the CSD is detectable with a sufficiently dense array. Specific Aim 1 involves the computer simulation of scalp potentials generated by CSDs of varying shapes and propagation patterns which will allow for the virtual design of the sensor array and the development of detection software. Specific Aim 2 involves prototype development, including the sensor array and user interface. Specific Aim 3 entails the testing of the device in normal control subjects and validating it using patients with acute brain injury in the Neuro-Intensive Care Unit (Neuro-ICU) who is known to exhibit CSD. In achieving these three Specific Aims we will reach five milestones: 1) the virtual design of the sensor system; 2) a software package for detection and analysis of CSDs; 3) a functioning prototype array; 4) a graphical user interface; and 5) human validation of the prototype. In Phase II, our primary goal will be to develop a marketable device for acute brain injury in the Neuro-ICU. Phase II will also test whether use could be expanded to include other conditions where CSD is hypothesized to occur, but which cannot currently be detected without our device (e.g. concussion, acute brain injury patients in emergency situations). From the use of our device in the Neuro-ICU (~20 times the number of those with a craniotomy), we estimate a potential market of 60K US customers that could generate $7M/year in revenue with a 5% market share. Our team combines individuals with expertise in electrical hardware and software design, EEG electrode development and implementation, numerical modeling and virtual design, and clinical and experimental investigation of CSD in brain injury. This expertise will allow us to produce this device through solid engineering principals. The direct and non-invasive assessment of CSD, as a primary neuropathological mechanism, would allow therapeutic targeting to improve outcomes in acute brain injury patients with CSDs, and possibly, after SBIR Phase II, provide an objective assessment of concussion."
"9538449","Abstract Integrated control of metabolism requires inter-organ communication in the peripheral tissues; this crosstalk is largely orchestrated by secreted hormones. Our long-term goal is to understand hormonal control of energy homeostasis. This proposal is a competitive renewal of a continuing research project focusing on a conserved family of secreted plasma proteins we identified, the C1q/TNF-related proteins (CTRPs). In the last decade, we have provided new and important knowledge on the roles and contributions of various CTRP hormones to whole-body glucose and lipid metabolism. In the next budget cycle, we will focus our studies on CTRP6, a protein with fundamentally different modes of action compared to other CTRPs characterized to date. Our preliminary studies on CTRP6, combined with recent studies of other CTRP family members, has led to the Yin and Yang concept, in which different CTRPs function as positive or negative regulators of substrate metabolism. The central hypothesis, based on gain- and loss-of-function mouse models, is that CTRP6 functions as a negative physiological regulator of glucose metabolism. We propose two specific aims toward understanding the mechanisms by which CTRP6 negatively regulates glucose metabolism at the tissue (Aim 1) and cellular (Aim 2) levels. We expect Aim 1 and Aim 2 to provide critical insights into metabolic gene circuits and signaling networks directly regulated by CTRP6 in adipocytes, skeletal muscle, and liver to control systemic energy metabolism. Since over-activation of the CTRP6-regulated pathways contributes to obesity-linked insulin resistance and diabetes, our studies have the potential to provide insights that lead to innovative strategies to reverse or mitigate metabolic disease outcomes in clinical settings."

"9369795","This application is for a K23 award for Dr. Joyce S. Lee, an Assistant Professor at the University of Colorado (CU) Denver. Career Goals: This k23 award will facilitate the following goals: (1) to understand the application of genetic and genomic epidemiology in the field of interstitial lung disease (ILD); (2) to gain knowledge in computational approaches to big data analysis; (3) to develop training in biomarker testing and development in subclinical disease states; (4) to conduct clinical and translational investigations to better understand subclinical rheumatoid arthritis-associated ILD (RA-ILD); and (5) to achieve her long-term career goal of becoming an independent clinical and translational research investigator in the field of ILD. Mentorship: To achieve these goals, Dr. Lee has assembled a mentoring team comprised of Dr. David Schwartz (primary mentor), an internationally recognized scientist in the field of ILD; Dr. Michael Holers (co- mentor), an internationally recognized expert in the immunologic investigations of early RA; and a research advisory committee that includes Dr. Tasha Fingerlin, an expert statistical geneticist and genetic epidemiologist, and content experts including Dr. Kevin Deane and Dr. Jill Norris. Training and Environment: She has constructed a rigorous career development plan that includes specific coursework, high-impact workshops, and mentorship, centered at CU, which provides the infrastructure, resources and collaborators necessary for high impact clinical research.  Research Objective: The overall goal of this research proposal is to define the clinical and molecular/genetic phenotype of subclinical RA-ILD. Relationship to Health: Deaths from RA-ILD are increasing despite an overall decline in RA mortality. Early detection of subclinical RA-ILD will identify patients with a lower burden of lung disease, potentially more salvageable lung, and may reveal novel molecular targets for intervention that are effective in the subclinical and/or early clinical stages of this progressive disease. Rationale: Preliminary data demonstrate clinical, genetic and biologic similarities between RA-ILD and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). This proposal leverages the progress that has been made in the understanding of established and subclinical forms of IPF. Hypothesis: Patients at risk for RA-ILD and IPF have shared clinical, genetic, and biological risk factors. Aims: This research proposal will define the phenotype and estimate the prevalence of subclinical RA-ILD (Aim 1), test the role of the MUC5B variant in subclinical RA-ILD (Aim 2A), and derive and validate a biomarker profile in subclinical RA-ILD (Aim 2B). Approach: To address this hypothesis and accomplish these aims, 400 RA patients will be enrolled and abnormalities of ILD identified using high-resolution computed tomography scans. This information will be used to develop a robust risk prediction algorithm to identify RA patients at highest risk for ILD in the clinical setting. Using this cohort, the genetic and biologic factors associated with subclinical RA-ILD will be investigated."
"9411178","PROJECT SUMMARY  Hypertension (HTN) affects approximately 33% of all adults living in the United States, particularly African Americans, who comprise over 42% of those with HTN [1-2]. In aging, HTN is associated with decreased cognitive functioning, and increased risk for clinically meaningful cognitive impairments and incident age-related neurodegenerative disorders [3-4]. HTN may confer risk for cognitive impairment via alterations in cerebral autoregulation (CA) caused by structural and functional changes to the cardiac and cerebral vasculature induced by HTN [5]. The impact of HTN on cognitive functioning in diverse, aging persons living with HIV (PLWH), however, is largely unknown, especially whether HTN differentially affects cognitive outcomes in HIV+ African Americans. Work in the cognitive aging literature suggests that HTN has a greater impact on cognitive functioning among African Americans than Latinos and non-Hispanic Whites [6]. One possible explanation for these differences may be due to disparities in HTN control that disproportionately affect African Americans [7-8].  As a result, we hypothesize that with aging, HTN as well as poor HTN control will exacerbate cognitive impairment in PLWH and that this effect will be greatest among African Americans. Therefore, the first aim of this study is to examine the longitudinal relationship between HTN and cognitive functioning in a diverse cohort of aging PLWH to examine the effects of HTN and HTN control on risk for cognitive impairments. These data will also be used to examine for racial disparities in the rates of cognitive impairment in this cohort. Finally given our limited understanding of the biological effects of HTN on brain functioning and cognition, the third aim of this study is to evaluate the longitudinal relationship between pulse pressure (PP), a surrogate marker of arterial stiffness, and cognition to indirectly explore the biological consequences of hypertension on the brain and CA [9]. Investigations regarding the potential impact of HTN, HTN control and PP on the brain and cognitive functioning are relevant given the increasing prevalence of HTN in aging PLWH, especially among HIV+ African Americans who currently comprise 50% of all HIV cases in the U.S. and experience greater hypertension burden [10]. Therefore, this project is both highly novel and significant as it will be the first to examine the longitudinal relationships between HTN, HTN control, PP and cognition in an exceptionally well- characterized and diverse sample with extensive longitudinal outcomes. Improved understanding of the role of HTN and HTN control on cognitive functioning in diverse, aging PLWH is critical to elucidate sources of health disparities frequently affecting underrepresented minority populations (URM). Thus, the results of this project also have important implications for public health, as this study will provide empirical evidence to inform and develop targeted intervention strategies that may mitigate cognitive dysfunction in URM."
"9367862","Project Summary This project aims to characterize at the molecular, cellular and organismal levels the pathophysiology of clonal histiocytic disorders, exemplified by Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH) and Erdheim-Chester Disease (ECD). These diseases display a considerable heterogeneity in terms of prognostic and clinical presentation, and are characterized by the occurrence of neurodegenerative syndromes and liver and lung fibrosis, the mechanisms of which are mysterious. Their pathophysiology is largely unknown. Two recent discoveries offer an opportunity to re-evaluate the pathophysiology and molecular underpinning of clonal histiocytic disorders, improve their diagnostic, prognostic, and offer new therapeutic strategies. First, the discovery of somatic mutations of the RAS-ERK pathway in >70% of cases of LCH and ECD by us and others has led to new therapeutic approaches based on the use of BRAF inhibitors and has renewed interests in efforts toward solving the pathophysiology of these diseases. Second, an important revision of our understanding of myeloid development stems from recent works from our laboratory and others which have revealed that the tissue- resident macrophages found in adult mice originate from early hematopoietic progenitors from the yolk sac independent of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and persist within their tissue of residence in adults. Following on this work, we made the novel hypothesis that somatic BRAF mutations in yolk sac progenitors may causes histiocytoses and we have developed in vivo models that allow to test this hypothesis experimentally. Our preliminary results indicate that conditional expression of a BRAFV600E allele in yolk sac hematopoietic progenitors in vivo does results in the accumulation of BRAFV600E macrophage clones in various tissues, and is responsible in particular for a neurodegenerative syndrome in adult mice, that recapitulates for the first time one of the most intriguing and adverse phenotypic characteristics of the human histiocytic neoplasms. We will (Aim 1) will investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie the development of brain neurodegenerative disease and identify molecular pathways that drive pathological histiocytes, (Aim 2) determine the pathological roles of BRAFV600E macrophages outside the brain in vivo and in particular in liver fibrosis, and (Aim 3) investigate the efficiency of BRAF inhibitor administration in the murine models. These experiments will provide a proof of concept that a mutations in yolk sac progenitors can cause an histiocytic disease in adults, help elucidate the pathophysiology and mechanism of histiocytoses and some of their most adverse complication such as the neurodegenerative syndrome, and reveal novel therapeutic targets to be used in conjunction with, or alternatively to, BRAF inhibitors.  "

"9395522","Abstract Biofilms and their persistence pose a serious public health concern, particularly in the hospital setting. Adhering to both biotic and abiotic surfaces, biofilms are implicated in a variety of different infections largely due to their significant decrease in antimicrobial susceptibility and clearance resistance. Not only are they found on medical devices, such as catheters, artificial joint implants, and prosthetic devices, but biofilms are also found in cystic fibrosis lungs and chronic cutaneous wounds. In the majority of bacterial species, the highly ubiquitous and important second messenger, c-di-GMP, is a central regulator of biofilm formation. We and others have recently discovered that c-di-GMP directly interacts with a subset of transcription factors belonging to the widespread NtrC-like bacterial enhancer binding protein (EBP) family to modulate biofilm gene expression as well as virulence factor, quorum sensing, and motility gene expression. In Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of the life-threatening disease cholera responsible for 5 million cases and over 100,000 deaths per year, the response regulator VpsR is the master EBP that interacts with c-di-GMP to positively regulate biofilm gene expression in vivo in part at the vpsL biofilm gene promoter. Although EBPs typically activate RNA polymerase (RNAP) containing the alternate s factor, s54, substitutions at crucial residues in VpsR needed for EBP function have suggested that the mechanism of VpsR activation is novel. Furthermore, the mechanism by which c-di-GMP interacts with transcriptional activators to directly alter gene expression is unknown. Using V. cholerae as a model to study c-di-GMP signaling and biofilm formation in vitro and in the bacterial cell, the goal of the proposed research is to elucidate this c-di-GMP-dependent transcription mechanism. With my preliminary work, I have established an in vitro system to show for the very first time that not only can an EBP together with c-di-GMP directly activate transcription in vitro, but also VpsR together with c-di-GMP activates transcription from RNAP containing the primary s, s70. Using these conditions, I will determine in Aim 1 the specific step by which VpsR/c-di-GMP activates transcription by assessing DNA binding, RNAP recruitment, open complex formation, and promoter clearance. In Aim 2, I will use genetic and biochemical tools to investigate protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions to construct a 3-dimensional molecular map of the transcription complex. Finally, in Aim 3, I will determine the VpsR/c-di-GMP binding pocket using a high- throughput genetic screen followed by in vitro confirmation for c-di-GMP binding and transcription activation and in vivo analysis for biofilm formation. The proposed research will be the first to utilize in vitro transcriptional studies to determine how c-di-GMP interacts with transcriptional regulators to directly change gene expression. This understanding will not only provide a new paradigm in c-di-GMP-dependent transcription activation and elucidate mechanistic processes that regulate biofilm formation, but also provide the foundation needed for the development of novel chemical inhibitors against V. cholerae and biofilm-based nocosomial infections. !"
"9471926","Accumulating evidence implicates inflammation and immune responses in the pathophysiology of stroke. Immunomodulation has therefore emerged as a promising therapy for stroke. Regulatory lymphocytes, including CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (CD4+ Treg) and IL-10+ regulatory B cells (Bregs) are established modulators of immune responses in the injured brain. We recently discovered that another specialized T cell subpopulation?the CD8+CD122+CD49dhigh regulatory T cell?is among the first to enter the ischemic brain, even preceding the infiltration of CD4+ Tregs and Bregs. The primary function of CD8+ Tregs is to modulate the activities of other immune cells, especially effector T lymphocytes, and to maintain immune homeostasis. We found that selective depletion of circulating CD8+ Tregs exacerbated brain injury and functional outcomes at 3 and 7 days after stroke, and this could be reversed by the reconstitution of CD8+ Tregs. These exciting results suggest that CD8+ Tregs are natural defenders against ischemic brain injury. Further pilot studies discovered that: 1) CD8+ Treg-afforded early protection relies on their infiltration into the ischemic brain, as CD8+ Tregs lacking the ?brain targeting signal? CXCR3 do not infiltrate into the ischemic brain and lose their capacity to reduce brain infarction in CD8+ Treg-depleted mice. 2) The infiltrated CD8+ Tregs undergo genomic reprogramming upon brain infiltration and transcriptional upregulation of a group of genes that possess inflammation-resolving and/or neurorestorative functions, including the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) receptor and epidermal growth factor-like transforming growth factor (ETGF). 3) Post-stroke adoptive transfer of CD8+ Tregs significantly reduces brain infarct, enhances white matter integrity, and improves neurological functions up to 14d after tMCAO. 4) Adoptive transfer of ETGF-deficient CD8+ Treg fails to protect against tMCAO. The current proposal will further explore the effects of CD8+ Tregs in ischemic stroke and develop CD8+ Treg adoptive transfer as an immune therapeutic therapy for stroke. The novel central hypothesis to be tested is that brain infiltration of CD8+ Tregs promotes long-term neurological recovery after stroke through LIF/LIFR/ETGF-mediated neuroprotection, resolution of neuroinflammation, and neurorestorative mechanisms. Three specific aims are proposed. Aim 1. Establish post-stroke adoptive transfer of CD8+ Tregs as a clinically relevant treatment against acute ischemic brain infarct. Aim 2. Test the hypothesis that post-stroke adoptive transfer of CD8+ Tregs promotes long-term neurological recovery and neurorestoration after ischemic stroke. Aim 3. Test the hypothesis that LIF/LIFR-mediated release of ETGF is essential for CD8+ Treg-afforded neuroprotection and neurorestoration. This study will be the first to rigorously investigate the role of CD8+ Tregs in ischemic brain injury.

Global efforts to combat TB are hampered by the emergence of drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), and variable efficacy of the currently licensed vaccine, M.bovis BCG (BCG). After pulmonary infection with Mtb, aerosolized bacteria are inhaled and interact with the host, resulting in the recruitment of immune cells to the lung to form the tubercle granuloma. Although the presence of granuloma has long been considered a hallmark of TB, the immunological differences between a protective granuloma and a non-protective granuloma has been elusive. Our recent published data, suggest that the presence of inducible Bronchus Associated Lymphoid Tissue (iBALT) within granulomas is indicative of protective granulomas that mediate Mtb control. In contrast, infiltrating neutrophils are characteristic of granulomatous inflammation in PTB patients. These new findings significantly change the overall consensus that TB granulomas in general are protective, but instead put forth the new paradigm that during TB, protective granulomas contain iBALT, while non-protective granulomas are neutrophilic. Our new preliminary data demonstrate that Group 3 Innate Lymphoid cells (ILC3) are among the first innate cells to rapidly accumulate in the lungs upon Mtb infection, and localize within B cell follicles in iBALT-containing granulomas. ILC3 deficiency in mice also results in increased early Mtb susceptibility, and coincides with reduced macrophage accumulation and poorly formed iBALT structures. Thus, the work proposed in this grant will mechanistically address a functional innate role for ILC3 in Mtb infection. In Specific Aim 1 we will define the host factors that mediate early lung ILC3 accumulation following Mtb infection. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine the mechanism(s) via which ILC3 mediate formation of iBALT-containing granulomas and facilitate Mtb control. In Specific Aim 3, we will determine a role for ILC3 in vaccine-induced immunity against TB, and identify new ways to target ILC3 to improve immunity against Mtb infection. Together these aims will provide novel evidence for a critical role for ILC3 in mediating iBALT formation and inducing protective host immunity to TB. Identifying new ways to target ILC3 cells to improve vaccine-immunity as proposed here, will open up novel avenues that can be harnessed for TB vaccine design."
"9430547","Project Abstract DNA replication is the most essential event in the propagation of a species. Defects in this process can cause diseases including birth (developmental) defects and cancer. When DNA replication is compromised genetically or environmentally, a state known as ?replication stress? (RESS) occurs that can lead to the aforementioned deleterious outcomes. Extensive basic research on the biochemistry of DNA replication has been conducted in single celled organisms and cultured cells, without regard for potential gender differences that may exist in higher organisms such as mammals. The goal of this project is to understand how the universal process of DNA replication is subject to dramatic sexual dimorphism in mammalian embryogenesis. Preliminary studies found that female mouse embryos were dramatically more prone to lethality when levels of the MCM2-7 (Minichromosome maintenance 2,3,4,5,6,7) DNA replication licensing and helicase proteins were genetically reduced and the helicase destabilized. Subsequent studies revealed that the female-biased lethality began occurring immediately after sex determination, and was not related to defects in X-inactivation.Transgene-mediated conversion of female embryos to males or testosterone administration reversed the gender-biased lethality, indicating that the phenomenon is related to secondary sexual characteristics. Further experiments suggested that testosterone enabled female embryo rescue by virtue of its anti-inflammatory activity, a possibility supported by the observation that ibuprofen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), also rescued MCM-deficient female embryos. This project seeks to elucidate the cellular and mechanistic basis of this novel example of mammalian sexual dimorphism. Aim 1 will test whether female- biased embryo lethality in MCM-depleted animals is due to gender differences in DNA replication per se, or differential sensitivity to intrinsic RESS. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that female embryo hypersensitivity is related to RESS-induced inflammation, while males embryos are protected by the anti-inflammatory activity of testosterone they produce in high levels following sex determination. Aim 3 will explore the basis of preliminary data showing that a key contributing factor in the sex bias phenomenon is the maternal environment; only dams with intrinsic RESS preferentially lost female embryos. This will be accomplished transferring at-risk genotypes of zygotes into foster mothers that are genotypically wild-type, MCM-deficient, or deficient for the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Overall, these studies will can impact our understanding of the relationships between RESS, inflammation, and adverse pregnancy outcomes related to maternal and/or fetal inflammatory responses that are genetically or environmentally induced."

"9324211","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Congenital Anomalies of the Kidney and the Urinary Tract (CAKUT) account for 40-50% of pediatric end-stage kidney failure worldwide. Among CAKUT categories, congenital obstructive uropathy represents a common and severe form of malformation. Congenital hydronephrosis is the most frequent anomaly of the urinary tract detected by prenatal ultrasound, occurring in up to 2% of normal pregnancies. Congenital obstructive uropathy can occur as familial or sporadic disease with highly variable phenotypic expression. Due to paucity of fundamental insight about primary pathogenesis, diagnostic and therapeutic options are severely limited. We recently implemented whole exome sequencing combined to functional modeling in zebrafish to identify dominant mutations in DSTYK in up to 2.3% of patients with congenital obstructive uropathy and associated urinary tract malformations (Sanna-Cherchi et al, New Engl J Med 2013). The protein encoded by DSTYK acts as a positive regulator of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling during nephrogenesis. This study illustrates the power of combining whole exome sequencing with functional modeling in animal models to identify novel disease causing mutations in traits characterized by high genetic heterogeneity, incomplete penetrance, variable phenotypic expression, and small/medium pedigree size. Here we propose to characterize the function of DSTYK during embryonic development and nephrogenesis in cell cultures and in mouse models harboring Dstyk mutations, to extend our gene identification effort to 50 additional families with autosomal dominant congenital obstructive uropathy and to perform functional modeling in zebrafish to identify novel susceptibility genes. This study will provide insight into the pathogenesis of congenital obstructive uropathy in humans and animal models and will help develop new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies."
"9458355","ABSTRACT  Myocardial infarction and stroke are major causes of morbidity and mortality among patients with cardiovascular disease and a major cause of long-term disability in the United States. Current imaging techniques are primarily used to determine the severity of luminal stenosis resulting from carotid plaque; however, stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) are often associated with the rupture of plaques from regions with non-significant luminal stenosis. Accurate identification of these high-risk, rupture-prone plaques may potentially prevent stroke, TIA and myocardial infarction in a significant number of patients. Non-contrast CT and CT angiography (CTA) are capable of quantifying calcium burden, plaque ulceration, and presence of lipid; however, CT uses ionizing radiation and cannot provide further information regarding risk of plaque rupture. Magnetic resonance imaging and angiography (MRI-MRA) can be used for assessment of plaque composition. However, MRI is technically difficult which prevents its large scale implementation for routine clinical use. There is an unmet clinical need for a non- invasive imaging test to accurately identify carotid plaques which are likely to rupture. Our team is developing a noninvasive test for identification of vulnerable plaque with the use of a new 18F labeled compound that can be detected with positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. This tracer has been shown to bind to integrin molecules found on the cell surface of macrophages, smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells, all of which are found in great abundance in vulnerable plaque. As a first step towards using this agent for clinical applications, we propose to demonstrate that carotid plaque uptake of this compound is increased in vulnerable plaque in patients who have had a recent stroke or TIA relative to patients with stable carotid artery plaque who are free of stroke or TIA. Our goal is to develop a noninvasive imaging test that can predict which carotid plaque is vulnerable and at an increased risk of rupture. This will enable physicians to prevent stroke or TIA in these patients by removal of plaque by surgery or carotid artery stenting. Ultimately, this technology may be used to detect vulnerable plaque in other vascular beds including the coronary arteries."
"9309940","Heart Failure (HF) is the most frequent cause of hospitalization among patients aged 65 or greater and leads to an enormous personal, societal and economic burden for the US population. Loop diuretics such as torsemide and furosemide are a cornerstone of HF therapy utilized to improve congestive symptoms. Prior data suggest that torsemide compared to furosemide advantageously alters pathophysiological mechanisms associated with progression, has a favorable pharmacodynamic profile and may decrease HF morbidity and mortality. Yet, furosemide is overwhelmingly utilized in daily practice which highlights clinical equipoise and an unmet need for an adequately powered study to definitively determine whether torsemide compared to furosemide improves outcomes to guide clinical practice. The ToRsemide compArisoN with furoSemide FOR Management of HF (TRANSFORM-HF) trial is a robustly-powered, prospective, randomized, comparative-effectiveness study which will change guidelines and have immediate clinical implications for the management of millions of patients with HF. The primary hypothesis of the TRANSFORM-HF trial is that torsemide will reduce all-cause mortality by a relative 15% compared with furosemide over a period of 12 months. Important secondary hypotheses include that torsemide compared to furosemide will 1) reduce 1-year all-cause mortality and first HF re-hospitalization; 2) improve health-related quality of life; and 3) increase survival time and decrease total cardiovascular hospitalizations compared with furosemide. The specific aims of the TRANSFORM-HF Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) and Data Coordinating Center (DCC) are to (1) Develop and administrate a clinical trial organization to efficiently coordinate study conduct and analysis; (2) Implement and monitor a ?real-world?, large-scale, pragmatic, clinical-effectiveness study using streamlined data acquisition with call center follow-up, and (3) Disseminate the trial results and implications to a broad audience and serve as a prototype for future pragmatic clinical trials. Our prospective, unblinded, 2-arm, phase III clinical trial of 6,000 hospitalized HF patients targeting robust enrollment of racial and ethnic minorities and women will randomize subjects 1:1 to either oral torsemide or furosemide prior to discharge. Enrollment will occur at 50 US hospital sites with established HF clinical excellence. A systematic data acquisition approach will minimize investigator and subject burden and use a call center at 6 and 12 months to document vital status, medication adherence, and health-related quality of life, and to acquire hospitalization information. The TRANSFORM-HF trial will be led by investigators and an operations team with substantial experience and expertise in HF care, clinical trials, data integration and administration working within the highly proven environment of the Duke Clinical Research Institute.

"9284289","The overall goal of this project is to develop a personalized approach to the diagnosis and treatment of human blood diseases where pathophysiology is driven by the alternative pathway of complement (APC). The APC is an important driver of thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA) including atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), post-transplant TMAs (ptTMA), hemolysis, elevated liver function tests, and low platelets (HELLP) syndrome and hypercoagulable states such as antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) and catastrophic antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (CAPS). For this proposal we refer to these closely related diseases as ?complementopathies?. Germline mutations in the genes that regulate the APC are found in up to 50% of patients with aHUS and have also been reported in ptTMAs, HELLP, and APS/CAPS. Unfortunately, the functional consequence of these mutations is not always clear. Terminal complement inhibition with eculizumab is highly effective for treating aHUS but is not used routinely because of difficulty in distinguishing aHUS and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and because of the high cost of the drug (~$600,000) annually. There are case reports of eculizumab being effective in treating ptTMAs, HELLP, and APS/CAPS. Currently, the pathophysiology of HELLP syndrome, APS/CAPS, and ptTMAs remains obscure and there are no FDA approved drugs to treat these often fatal or highly morbid diseases. Recently, we developed a novel serum based assay, modified HAM test, which is highly sensitive and specific for detecting systemic activation of the APC; the assay is also highly effective in distinguishing aHUS from thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). We also demonstrate that continued administration of eculizumab is unnecessary in most aHUS cases if therapy is instituted rapidly. Our new preliminary data demonstrate that systemic activation of the APC is also a driver of the HELLP syndrome, APS/CAPS and ptTMAs. In this project we endeavor to solve the most pressing needs in the field of complement-driven TMAs (aHUS, HELLP, APS/CAPS etc) by: 1) establishing a rapid diagnosis; 2) predicting which patients will benefit most from complement inhibition (precision medicine); 3) linking the genotype and phenotype of complementopathies; and 4) defining ?innocent versus guilty? autoantibodies in APS/CAPS. Therefore, this laboratory research project is hypothesis-driven, translational, and goal-oriented. If successful, our proposal will open the door to precision medicine for TMAs and potentially APS/CAPS."

"9205858","PROJECT SUMMARY Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death globally, with roughly 700,000 cases diagnosed worldwide in 2012 alone. Treatment with the standard care agent sorafenib only modestly improves overall survival by an average of 3-months. Therefore, there is a huge unmet clinical need to identify new effective therapies for HCC patients. Drug repurposing is one shortcut to give HCC patients more options. One drug repurposing method makes prediction based on the reversal relation of gene expression between diseases and drugs. It has led to a number of drug candidates successfully validated in preclinical models. The recent NIH-funded projects The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) have dramatically increased the number of expression profiles of diseases and drugs, providing new exciting drug repurposing opportunities. By use the data from TCGA and LINCS, we identified four candidates (niclosamide, pyrvinium pamoate, mebendazole, and miglitol) that could significantly reverse HCC gene expression and are novel to HCC. Interestingly, these candidates are reported to target glucose metabolism. Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to leverage our capabilities to evaluate the four candidates based on the criteria proposed by this RFA. Our central hypothesis is that a drug that reverses the HCC gene expression signature and targets glucose metabolism could be a novel therapeutic in HCC. To validate our hypothesis, we propose two aims:(1) Select Drug X from four drug candidates based on their efficacy, specificity, potency to reverse disease gene expression, and the effect on glucose metabolism in vitro (2) Evaluate in vivo anti-tumor efficacy of Drug X in PDX models and primary mouse models. Our methodology can be extended to the evaluation of other top predicted candidates, and be applied to the study of other types of cancers"
"9381002","Decreases in the immune response with aging, including B lymphocytes and their progeny, antibody- secreting (ASC), are a major contributor to mortality and morbidity in the elderly population. This can be seen by increased infections and lower response to vaccination as well as an increase in various diseases such as cancer and autoimmunity. The age-related decrease in B cell function is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation and associated with an increase in fat, visceral adipose tissue (VAT). Despite its public health importance, the root causes of this decrease in B cell function are not well understood. We have recently shown that aged/old mice have increased VAT associated with lower in vivo antibody response, and adipocyte-derived molecules may not only recruit immune cells but also contribute to the inflammatory process. Our preliminary data in mice show infiltrating immune cells in the VAT, higher percentages of pro- inflammatory B cells (Age-associated B Cells, ABC) and T cells (??, gamma-delta), and higher amounts of the IgG2c subclass, associated with autoimmune antibodies.  We hypothesize that the VAT is an important generator of inflammatory B (and T) cells which contributes to the dysfunction of the aged immune system. Our preliminary data show that adipocytes secrete chemokines which could attract B cells to the VAT and for which the corresponding receptors are expressed by VAT B cells. In this proposal, Aim 1 will determine if the adipose tissue is contributing to the phenotypic and functional changes in B cell subsets observed in older/obese mice. Included in these studies will be testing for the promotion of pro-inflammatory B cell subsets by co-culture of adipocytes from the VAT with splenic B cells from the same mice. Our preliminary data for this show an increase in the relative percentage of the inflammatory ABC, similar to what we have observed in the VAT. We will also confirm if adipocytes produce several pro-inflammatory chemokines and if there are autoantibodies in the VAT for self-antigens. In Aim 2 we will determine which changes in metabolic pathways are responsible for the reduced antibody responses in mice undergoing DIO (diet-induced obesity) by doing mechanistic studies on mitochondrial function in DIO and controls and associating with an in vitro B cell response. An in vivo response to NP-OVA will also be measured in DIO mice. In Aim 3 we will determine if ABC are making autoimmune antibodies and less protective antibodies (than FO, follicular B cells) in response to in vivo antigen stimulation and do interventions to determine how that might be improved. These studies will help to determine mechanisms for obesity-related changes in inflammation, how these decrease the function of the immune system and if we can restore B cell function in the aged and obese mice. At the conclusion of our studies we will have expanded our knowledge of mechanisms for inflammation generating B cell deficiencies in aging/obesity and identified candidate strategies for their improvement."

"9378970","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This application is in response to NCI Provocative Question (PQ) 9 to test an innovative hypothesis that senescent cells (SCs) induced by ionizing radiation (IR), particularly senescent type 2 alveolar epithelial cells (AEC2s), are the perpetuators primarily responsible for initiating pathogenesis and driving progression of radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis (RIPF); therefore, clearance of SCs with a senolytic drug that selectively kills SCs can prevent RIPF and/or delay its progression and, more importantly, reverse existing tissue fibrosis, even after RIPF becomes a progressive disease. This hypothesis is based on the long-term understanding of tissue fibrosis pathogenesis and the exciting new findings about the role of SCs in pulmonary fibrosis, including RIPF. Specifically, pulmonary fibrosis is a disease caused by aberrant wound healing responses that are presumably initiated by cellular senescence induction in AEC2s, which are considered alveolar stem cells (ASCs). This process causes AEC2 defects in self-renewal and differentiation and an inability to generate AECs for maintenance of the alveolar epithelial barrier and to repair damaged lung epithelium. Senescent AEC2s also produce increased levels of reactive oxygen species and release an array of proinflammatory and profibrotic factors, as a result of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) expression, which may initiate and perpetuate pulmonary fibrosis development by inducing chronic oxidative stress and inflammation and promoting abnormal repair of tissue injury. This is supported by the findings that (1) AEC2 senescence, induced by AEC2-specific deletion of telomeric repeat-binding factor 2 (Trf2), in adult mice causes ASC failure, provokes pulmonary inflammation and fibrotic responses, and sensitizes mice to bleomycin- induced pulmonary fibrosis and (2) cellular senescence inhibition can prevent RIPF and delay bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis progression. Our preliminary studies showed that treatment of the thoracic irradiated mice with ABT-263, a specific Bcl-2/xl inhibitor and a newly discovered senolytic drug by our group, almost completely reversed RIPF, even when ABT-263 treatment was delayed until RIPF was established. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that RIPF can be reversed by a drug after it becomes a progressive disease. From these novel findings, we will test our hypothesis through the following specific aims using our well- established thoracic irradiation mouse model: (1) validate that SCs are the perpetuators primarily responsible for initiating pathogenesis and driving progression of RIPF; (2) elucidate the mechanisms by which clearance of SCs prevents and reverses RIPF; and (3) develop a safer and more effective senolytic drug treatment for RIPF. RIPF is one of the most deleterious late effects of thoracic radiotherapy. Our proposed studies will lead to the identification of the underlying mechanisms whereby IR causes pulmonary fibrosis and development of an innovative mechanism-based therapy that can not only prevent and/or delay RIPF but also reverse RIPF."
"9322566","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a common and devastating complication of Diabetes mellitus responsible for increased morbidity and mortality, loss of quality of live and rising costs. Current treatment options have shown only limited success. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression on a post-transcriptional level, mediate many disease processes and are considered novel diagnostic and interventional candidate due to their biochemical structure. Therefore, the overall aim of this project is to define the role of miRNAs in DN. To identify candidate miRNAs that mediate progression of DN, we determined miRNA expression in glomeruli and tubule-interstitial compartments of patients with DN and normal glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and correlated miRNA expression with albuminuria, a risk factor for progression of DN. miR-21 was highly abundant and glomerular expression strongly correlated with albuminuria, whereas no correlation was detected with expression in tubulo-interstitial (TI) compartment. In murine models of glomerular injury loss of miR-21 was associated with increased proteinuria and podocyte apoptosis, consistent with findings in cancer models where miR-21 is considered oncogenic. In contrast, inhibition or loss of miR-21 ameliorates TI fibrosis after injury and does not regulate TEC-survival. In miR-21-deficient podocytes and tubular epithelial cells (TEC) unique transcriptomic responses to TGF-beta were detected, and inhibition or loss of miR-21 was associated with increased TGF-beta/Smad and ERK signaling activity in podocytes and glomeruli, but decreased activity in TEC and kidney cortex of diabetic mice. These findings suggest functions of miR-21 are dependent on cell-type. Furthermore, we determined that miR-34a expression is repressed by miR-21 and miR- 34a induces apoptosis in podocyte but has not effect on TEC survival, suggesting miR- 34 as a downstream mediator of cell-type-specific functions of miR-21. Cell-type specific function of miRNAs is further supported by different miRNA binding sites detected between primary neurons and podocytes using Photoactivatable-Ribonucleoside- Enhanced Crosslinking & Immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) method to determine RNA transcripts incorporated into the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC). Therefore we hypothesize that the functions of miRNAs differentially expressed in DN and induced by cellular stress are not equivalent in all cell types and that those differences are at least partially reflected in the functions of transcripts of codig genes bound to RISC. We propose to test this for miR-21, which exhibits cell type- and context- specific functions and determine the role of miR-34 as a downstream mediator of cell- type specific functions of miR-21 in DN."
"9366378","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder. There are no existing therapies that can reverse disease progression, and thus new approaches are urgently needed. Accumulation of amyloid beta (A?), a proteolytic cleavage product of amyloid precursor protein (APP), is considered the initiating step in pathogenesis, but the signaling pathways that control this process are not well defined. Synaptic activity is thought to be a key driver of APP amyloidogenic processing, but the molecular links between neuronal activity and A? production are unclear. An attractive candidate is Plk2, a synaptic activity-inducible member of the polo-like kinase (Plk) family that functions in homeostatic synaptic plasticity to weaken synapses in response to prolonged overexcitation. Plk2 is upregulated in AD brain, directly phosphorylates APP and is required for APP amyloidogenic processing in response to chronic hyperexcitation in vitro. Importantly, inhibition of Plk2 (using transgenic dominant negative interference or a small molecule Plk inhibitor) shows encouraging evidence of slowing pathogenesis in AD model mice. The physiological function of APP has remained elusive, but as a Plk2 substrate, APP may play a role in synaptic depression. We identified Plk2 phosphorylation sites within APP C-terminus that was critical for downregulation of AMPA receptors during homeostatic synaptic plasticity. Interestingly, distinct APP phosphorylation sites are required for AMPA receptor internalization during a different form of plasticity, NMDA-receptor dependent long term depression (LTD). In this proposal we will test the hypotheses that (1) pharmacological inhibition of Plk2 using 2 different small molecule inhibitors slows disease progression in mouse models of AD; (2) Plk2 plays a selective role among Plk family members in activity-regulated APP processing, as determined by analysis of conventional and conditional knockout mice for Plk1-3; and 3) APP is centrally involved in synaptic depression of AMPA receptors at excitatory synapses under diverse plasticity paradigms, triggered by different kinases (Plk2 or GSK3) signaling through a combinatorial ?phosphorylation code? in the APP C-terminus. This proposal is highly significant as it will help elucidate novel physiological mechanisms that link different forms of synaptic activity to APP amyloidogenic processing. These studies will advance basic understanding of APP function and synaptic plasticity, while uncovering and validating novel targets for therapeutic interventions in AD."
"9341290","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this proposal for the K01 Career Development Award from the NIDDK is to enhance the learning and research skills of the applicant in order to transition into an independent investigator. The career development aspect of this award is facilitated by his mentoring team, relevant courses, journal clubs, seminars, university centers, and cores dedicated to enhancing collaboration between clinicians and researchers. The research portion of this proposal is focused on the autoimmune disease IgA nephropathy (IgAN), which causes progressive kidney damage, and the mechanisms of autoantigen production. Identification of mechanisms involved in autoantigen production will allow for disease-specific therapies to be developed, which is absent in current therapeutic modalities. This has a huge cost burden on IgAN patients, both in terms of money and quality of life.  The long-term goal of the applicant is to become an independent investigator, and as a current postdoc this will require more training and experience. This will be accomplished through collaboration with mentors who have extensive experience in molecular biology research, and specifically IgAN and kidney related diseases. The university has exceptional core programs set up to help young investigators with finding and writing grants, obtaining proper collaborative expertise, research training programs, and lab management courses.  IgAN is an autoimmune disease, which leads to decreased kidney function, with 40-50% of patients requiring dialysis and/or transplantation. In this autoimmune disease, B cells from the immune system produce IgA1 that has an aberrant glycosylation (termed Gd-IgA1) that causes the body to recognize IgA1 as a foreign antigen. The autoantigen, Gd-IgA1, is elevated in IgAN patients and forms the basis for immune-complex formation, which deposits in the kidney, leading to progressive kidney damage. The aims of this proposal are to identify mechanisms responsible for elevated Gd-IgA1 production in patient B cells. Identification of specific glycosylation enzymes that are differentially regulated and over activation signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) by cytokines in IgAN patient B cells has provided us with a strong starting point. We propose to investigate mechanisms responsible for altered signaling in IgAN patients, thereby providing bases for future drug development to reduce autoantigen production."
"9209895","OVERVIEW-SUMMARY The emergence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002-3 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012 demonstrates that zoonotic coronaviruses (CoV) have and will likely continue to spread from zoonotic sources to infect human populations. MERS-CoV continues to circulate in camels and to spread to susceptible humans, highlighting the need to better understand the pathogenesis of diseases mediated by pathogenic human respiratory CoV. In this PPG, investigators with experience in coronavirus pathogenesis, molecular biology, immunology and vaccinology will work together to understand how virus factors and dysregulated innate and adaptive immune responses contribute to MERS and SARS disease in young and aged animals and in animals with co-morbidities. All of the projects will utilize newly developed mice expressing human MERS receptor (DPP4) in lieu of the mouse receptor (hDPP4-KI) and a mouse-virulent MERS-CoV, selected in these mice (MERSMA). Project 1 will use MERSMA to investigate the role of aging in infected mice. Project 1 is also based on published data showing that specific eiconsanoids with anti-inflammatory properites and their upstream phopholipases increase during aging, contributing to a delayed immune response after SARS-CoV (and by extension, perhaps MERSMA) infection. Project 2 is based on preliminary data showing that MERS-CoV has a greater dependence on host cell proteases for virus entry than does SARS-CoV. This project will investigate unique mutations found in the surface (S) glycoprotein of MERSMA that appear to affect protease function. Project 3 will investigate how MERSMA causes more severe disease than the initial human EMC/2012 strain, with focus on the ORF4b accessory protein. This project will also investigate how hDPP4 contributes to disease severity. Project 4 is based on published data showing that the CoV E protein has ion channel activity, is a virulence factor and contains a PDZ binding domain (PBM), which is critical for virus viability. This project will focus on how the E protein causes edema in lungs and on the role of the PBM in pathogenesis. A novel PBM in the C terminal of E arose in MERSMA during mouse passage and its role will be studied. This project will also continue to develop safe, live attenuated MERS and SARS vaccines. All of the projects will use the Animal/Virology Core, which will provide nonrecombinant and recombinant MERS-CoV and SARS-CoVs and will monitor and analyze infected mice. Using the Core for these purposes will maximize experimental quality control and effective use of our resources. These projects are all interrelated and collaborative, will take advantage of the unique skills and expertise of the project directors and provide new information about MERS and SARS pathogenesis that is essential to vaccine development."
"9374257","Project Summary / Abstract Exposure to acute single-incident trauma is unfortunately common for children. Injury (unintentional and violence-related), disasters and terrorism, and other potentially traumatic events affect millions of children each year. Trauma-exposed children exhibit a wide variation in psychological and functional adaptation and outcomes, with a significant proportion developing traumatic stress or other psychological sequelae which can impact child health and functioning. Although the vast majority of studies examining these sequelae have been cross-sectional, a growing body of prospective studies have assessed children's adaptation over time following acute trauma exposure. Due to resource limitations, many prospective studies involve small samples, and variation in measures and assessment timing make cross-study comparisons challenging. Integrative cross- study analyses using individual patient data are possible, but require substantial attention to dataset integration and data harmonization that is generally beyond the reach of individual investigators. Our overarching objective is to create a research resource for the child trauma field that will enhance the utility and value of child trauma studies by allowing integrative cross-study analyses and promoting the use of common data elements across future studies. In the proposed R03-funded project, we will leverage the solid framework of an existing set of 20 datasets and related expertise in data harmonization, to create the Prospective studies of Acute Child Trauma and Recovery (PACT/R) data archive. The PACT/R archive will include US and international prospective studies with data from at least 31 studies representing more than 7000 children from 6 countries exposed to a wide range of potentially traumatic events including injury, violence, and natural disaster. Project aims include (Aim 1) Adding at least 11 new datasets (data from >4000 children) and establishing reproducible templates for data intake and cleaning, as well as application of meta- data and creating a searchable database of studies, variables, and measures. (Aim 2) Guided by an expert advisory panel, we will create, apply, and share algorithms for data harmonization of key variables and constructs to enable integrative cross-study data analyses. (Aim 3) We will promote awareness of the PACT/R archive as a resource for data sharing and secondary data analysis via a PACT/R webpage, and (Aim 4) convene an expert advisory panel to identify challenges to data harmonization as well as gaps in available data from acute child trauma studies, and recommend common data elements for future prospective studies in this area of research. Project results will advance data sharing, enable secondary analysis of prospective data on child trauma and recovery by the scientific community that would not otherwise be possible, and enhance the value of future research in this crucial area of study by recommending core data elements."
"9362298","Our goal is to leverage our collective academic and industry experience in antiviral research and development to advance an exciting novel inhibitor with broad-spectrum activity against the influenza A virus (IAV) Priority Pathogen?towards an IND. Our lead molecule, LNA9, is a short 15 base locked nucleic acid (LNA) ?gapmer? that specifically targets an essential IAV packaging signal composed of a unique RNA second- ary structure that we recently discovered and found to be conserved across all examined subtypes of IAV, including 1918 pandemic flu, high path avian (H5N1) and 2009 `swine' (H1N1). LNA9 has a nuclease-resistant phosphorothioate backbone and an internal RNAse H activating sequence that is designed to catalytically disrupt and degrade its target IAV packaging signal. In vitro, LNA9 dramatically inhibits IAV packaging at nM concentrations when added before or after infection, and in vivo, intranasal (IN) administration of LNA9 at -12, 8, and 36 hours post infection completely prevents IAV lethality in mice. We now seek to develop LNA9 into a clinical stage drug by: 1) Further expanding the virology data package by a) demonstrating activity against additional highly pathogenic and drug resistant strains of IAV; b) providing additional evidence for LNA9's high barrier to the development of resistance compared to other direct-acting antivirals in vitro and in vivo; c) determining the minimum in vivo effective dose, and number of days before or after infection that LNA9 administration can rescue from influenza mortality; and d) demonstrating LNA9's efficacy in second validated ferret model, including prevention of transmission: 2) Enabling the optimal delivery and monitoring methods for in vivo preclinical studies by: a) demonstrating the in vivo efficacy of IV delivery to complement the currently proven IN route; b) establishing the analytical methods to monitor the distribution and clearance kinetics of LNA9 following in vivo administration; and c) performing mouse, rat, and dog single dose PK studies via IN and IV routes; 3) Manufacturing LNA9 to support the requisite IND-enabling and initial clinical studies by a) synthesizing 5g of non-GMP LNA9, and 10g of GMP LNA9; and b) performing the final release/stability studies of the product (API); 4) Performing initial in vitro ADME-Tox and preclinical animal safety testing; and 5) Completing the IND-enabling GLP safety pharmacology and multiple dose 14-day escalation rodent and non- rodent toxicity studies, a clinical development plan, and pre-IND meeting package.  Our multidisciplinary team--including academics and industry partners with demonstrated expertise in virology, influenza biology, oligonucleotide chemistry, pulmonary formulation and delivery, regulatory affairs, and successful early drug development?is ideally suited for this proposal. Successful accomplishment of our specific aims will yield an exciting novel drug capable of conferring protection against this key Priority Pathogen, including its most virulent strains that threaten millions. !"
"9326289","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The acute nucleus (ARC) is a key regulator of metabolic homeostasis in the brain through actions of two key neurons containing the neuropeptides POMC and NPY. Mutations in Pomc are directly linked to obesity caused by hyperphagy and a reduction in locomotor activity. These phenotypes are observed in both mice and humans. Despite the critical importance of POMC containing neurons, little is known about genes and pathways that regulate both formation of these neurons and expression of Pomc. Another subset of neurons found within the ARC are also involved in reproductive function and puberty onset: Kisspeptin neurons. Disruptions in Kisspeptin signaling result in hypergonadotropic hypogonadism and are linked to infertility. Despite some studies of neurogenesis within the ARC, it is still unclear at which stage of embryogenesis development of each neural subtype occurs. There is strong evidence suggesting that POMC and NPY neurons involved in energy homeostasis arise from a common intermediate progenitor. However, whether Kisspeptin neurons are also derived from the same progenitor remains unknown. It has been accepted that the Notch signaling pathway regulates progenitor maintenance and cell fate in the ARC. If Notch signaling is not extinguished, neurogenesis cannot occur within the ARC. In contrast, if Notch signaling is absent, there is a premature burst of Pomc and NPY neuron differentiation at the expense of HVZ progenitors. The molecular pathway that Notch signaling regulates to control this process is unknown. Additionally, since Kisspeptin neurons also reside within the ARC and are presumed to develop from the same progenitor pool, it is plausible that Notch signaling may be involved in development of these neurons as well. The major goals of this proposal are to determine the lineage relationship of different neurons in the ARC and to define the mechanism by with Notch signaling controls ARC cell fate. Utilizing an established BrdU birthdating paradigm in combination with a well-characterized Pomc reporter line, the timetable and lineage of neurons involved in feeding and reproduction found within the ARC will be determined. Using conditional knock-out and transgenic persistent expressor mouse models, the role of the Notch signaling pathway in development of Kisspeptin neurons will begin to be uncovered. A novel in vitro embryonic hypothalamic cell line will allow exploration of the mechanism by with the Notch signaling pathway regulates expression of genes vital to the establishment of neuronal subtypes of the ARC. Results from these studies will define the progression of neurogenesis in this key homeostatic region of the brain and may provide insight into developmental origins of obesity and infertility."
"9376903","PROJECT SUMMARY Recently, the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) reported that more intensive blood pressure (BP) treatment (target systolic BP<120 mmHg) reduced major cardiovascular disease (CVD) by about 25% and all-cause mortality by about 27% compared to standard BP treatment (target systolic BP<140 mmHg) among hypertensive patients aged ?50 years and at high risk for CVD. SPRINT clearly answered the question ? Will lowering BP more than the currently recommended goal further reduce the risk of CVD and mortality? The next important question is how to implement a more intensive BP treatment program in real-world clinical practice, especially in populations with health disparities. Traditionally, underserved populations have benefited less from clinical research, which contributes to health disparities in the US. We propose to conduct an effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial to simultaneously test the effectiveness of a multicomponent intervention for more intensive BP treatment and the feasibility, fidelity, and sustainability of implementing the intervention in underserved patients with hypertension and at high risk for CVD in Louisiana. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research has been used to guide the development of the multicomponent intervention, including protocol-based treatment using the SPRINT stepped-care intensive BP management algorithm, dissemination of SPRINT study findings among patients, provider-teams, and administrators, team- based collaborative care, BP audit and feedback, home BP monitoring, and health coaching on BP medication adherence and lifestyle modification. We will collaborate with 30 Federally Qualified Health Center clinics that serve low-income populations in southeast Louisiana to conduct the proposed trial. The primary clinical outcome is the difference in the proportion of patients with systolic BP <120 mmHg between the intervention and control groups at 18 months. The secondary outcomes are the differences in mean changes of systolic and diastolic BP from baseline to 18 months, adverse effects, and quality of life. The fidelity of the intervention, measured by intensification of treatment (titration or addition of new medication) by provider-teams and adherence to medications in patients, will be the primary implementation outcome. The proposed trial, with a sample size of 30 clinics (38 patients/clinic), has 90% statistical power to detect a 15% increase in the proportion of patients with systolic BP<120 mmHg (primary clinical outcome) at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05. An intra-cluster correlation of 0.049 and a proportion of patients with intensive BP control (systolic BP <120 mmHg) of 25% in the control group are assumed based on previous experience. We will recruit 1,350 patients (45 patients/clinic) to make up for lost statistical power due to potential withdrawal. This study is very timely and has important public health and clinical implications. It will generate urgently needed data on effective, adoptable, and sustainable intervention strategies aimed at eliminating health disparities and reducing the BP-related disease burden in ethnic minority and low-income populations in the US."
"9307797","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol and drug abuse among sexual minority women (SMW) is an increasingly recognized public health concern in the United States. Across a multitude of nationally-representative samples, SMW populations report higher rates of substance use and disorder (SU/D) across the lifespan, and further report greater levels of adversity in both childhood and adolescence as members of a stigmatized group.1,2 Although minority stress models suggest that higher levels of adversity may explain mental health disparity among sexual minority populations,3,4 few studies have examined the impact of adversity across development among SMW in predicting SU/D in later life; none have examined psychological mediators of this proposed pathway; and none have examined moderators of this developmental pathway. The goal of the present proposal is to examine the impact of adversity on psychological risk factors of SU/D across development and address protective factors that reduce risk for later SU/D among SMW. Specifically, the proposed study will test whether adversity and subsequent increases in emotion dysregulation (ED) among SMW in childhood and adolescence account for higher levels of SU/D through young adulthood, and will examine whether social support from peers and parents within adolescence buffers this proposed risk pathway. Data will be drawn from 2,278 heterosexual and 173 sexual minority women who participated in the Pittsburgh Girls Study. The Pittsburgh Girls Study is a large, diverse sample of inner-city girls followed prospectively from age 5 to age 23, and contains a large longitudinal sample of SMW ideal for addressing the proposed study aims. Factor analysis, latent growth curve modeling (LGM), and multi-group structural equation modeling (SEM) will be used to test 1) whether ED and adversity experiences in childhood and adolescence predict increases and higher levels of SU/D through young adulthood; 2) whether ED mediates the effects of adversity and SMW status on SU/D, and whether ED moderates the impact of adolescent adversity on SU/D; and 3) whether social support moderates the effect of ED and early and adolescent adversity on later SU/D across sexual orientation groups. Addressing these questions will inform both preventative and treatment intervention efforts to reduce the prevalence of substance disorder among lesbian, gay, and bisexual populations by informing the early identification of environmental risk factors associated with sexual minority status across development; by identifying target psychological processes that have a direct impact on substance use and disorder among lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals; and by addressing risk and resilience in the context of social support within this at-risk population."

"9301419","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT ? Physical Measures Core (PMC) An important consideration for investigators undertaking studies relevant to our theme ?To Understand and Optimize Reserve and Resilience? is how to select and implement the most appropriate and meaningful measures. A Physical Measures Core will provide this service by serving as the central resource for Center investigators seeking advice, training, laboratory access, and equipment for valid, sensitive, and reliable measures. A panel of 13 members, with complementary expertise in measurement across multiple domains, comprises the Core. The Physical Measures Core will provide highly integrated, customized support to investigators supported by our Research Education Component, Pilot/Exploratory Studies Core, Externally Funded Projects, and the larger Duke Community engaged by the Duke Older Americans Independence Center. The Core will support investigators by meeting regularly throughout the full spectrum of project development, from early phase planning, to final interpretation of findings, to subsequent grant preparations to dissemination and/or implementation. These meetings will concurrently involve members of the Analysis and Molecular Measures Cores to assure maximal synergy. We propose three Specific Aims. Aim 1 - To provide centralized expertise available for consultation on the measurement of reserve and resilience. Aim 2 - To develop measurement protocols and train personnel in administration and data collection. Aim 3 - To identify gaps in resiliency measures and develop or adapt innovative new measurement approaches across the adult lifespan for related outcomes. Projects for five REC Scholars and two PES awardees will be supported during the first two years of funding. Members of the PMC will also provide service to five EPs, and propose an innovative ?Emerging Discovery Project? to develop two new tools to measure muscle reserve and function using electrical impedance myography and quantitative muscle ultrasound. Two workshops are proposed, one to provide training in physical performance and functional testing, and one to provide training in ambulatory measurement and data collection, to augment the measurement capabilities of our trainees; if successful these workshops can be disseminated to other OAICs. The PMC will provide an invaluable service to our Center, which will lead to greater understanding of reserve and resilience, and which in turn, will point to opportunities to improve the current and future health and well-being of aging Americans across the lifespan."
"9323836","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is the infection of the human nervous system by the larvae of the pork tapeworm Taenia solium. Subarachnoid neurocysticercosis (SANCC) accounts for 20-35% of all NCC cases. It is an aggressive, progressive and frequently lethal presentation of NCC, endemic in most non-Muslim developing countries. Unlike intraparenchymal disease (where the predominant manifestation is seizures and epilepsy, and parasites are located in the brain tissue), in subarachnoid disease the presence of the parasitic masses in the surroundings of the brain, their growth, and the concomitant inflammatory process lead to mass effect, intracranial hypertension and/or hydrocephalus, resulting in heavy morbidity and significant mortality which can be more than 20%. The response to antiparasitic treatment in SANCC is usually slow and partial, but if complete parasite resolution is obtained patients may be cured without further symptoms.  This application naturally expands the scope of and applies the knowledge obtained from a recent NINDS-funded trial on combined albendazole (ABZ) plus praziquantel (PZQ) treatment of intraparenchymal NCC [R01 NS054805]. The current treatment regimens for SANCC have quite limited efficacy and the disease is still associated with significant mortality in many places of te world. Combining ABZ and PZQ, along with appropriate steroid coverage and other safety measures, is the logical next step to improve the management of subarachnoid NCC and has not been examined before in a controlled trial.  In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, 164 patients with subarachnoid cysticercosis of the basal cisterns or the Sylvain fissure, will be assigned to either the standard of care anti- parasitic regime (30-day ABZ at 15 mg/k/d) or a combined regime adding PZQ at 50 mg/k/d for the initial 15 days of anti-parasitic treatment. The primary study endpoint is the proportion of patients with disappearance of their parasitic lesions in neuroimaging at six months after therapy onset. Secondary outcomes include the decrease in volume of parasitic masses measured by MRI at 3 and 6 months after treatment onset, clinical improvement evaluated as the proportion of patients asymptomatic and without need for further antiparasitic treatment 6 months post-treatment, the frequency of serious adverse events (SAE) of the combined regime compared to the standard of care, the decrease in the serum levels of circulating parasitic antigen at 3 and 6 months after treatment onset, and the proportion of patients whose lesions resolve and do not relapse by 12 months after treatment onset.  The trial will initially involve four centers: two in Peru, one in Brasil and one in Ecuador with the potential to expand to more centers if required. By comparing two active regimes, the proposed parallel group design permits open assessment of control neuroimaging scans for patient safety without affecting treatment blinding, and will provide the first data to support either therapeutic change or maintenance of the standard of care. If this tril succeeds, it will provide a new, more appropriate standard of care, available worldwide."
"9325007","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anemia is a major source of morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly among women and children. Much of this burden is attributable to defective red blood cell production (erythropoiesis). A greater understanding of erytkhropoiesis holds promise for the development of better therapies for various forms of anemia. Recent genome-wide association (GWA) studies have revealed over 75 loci associated with red blood cell traits. Furthermore, multiple bioinformatic analyses suggest that the majority of variation du to these common variants is intrinsic to red cell progenitors and precursors, allowing for directed studies on the effects of these genetic variants. Nevertheless, only a few studies of specific candidates have revealed new regulators of erythropoiesis. We and others have shown that many of the erythroid-trait associated loci (and variants in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD)) ar located in non-coding regions of the genome, enriched for empirically defined regions of open chromatin and erythroid enhancer elements marked by the erythroid transcription factors (TFs) GATA1, TAL1, KLF1, and NFE2. In select cases, we have shown that these variants are contained in and affect the activity of those enhancers and that they are dependent upon GATA1 activity. In this project, we propose to utilize a novel and innovate approach termed massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to systematically measure the activity of thousands of putative enhancer elements containing variants in strong LD with GWA study loci. Enhancers that show differential activity dependent upon the allele of the candidate variant contained will be prioritized for functional follow-up using cutting-edge CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology to confirm causality of that variant with respect to changes in proximal gene expression. Additionally, we will perform a second MPRA in GATA1-induced cells to examine whether each element is dependent upon the activity of the key hematopoietic TF GATA1. Increased differential enhancer activity will likely signal disruption of GATA1, co-factor, or nove TF binding sites, providing evidence of the underlying biological mechanism. Furthermore, each enhancer element of interest will be fully explicated per nucleotide using an innovative multiple mutagenesis approach in a similar MPRA, allowing for identification of TF binding site motifs linked to known or novel TFs involved in erythropoiesis. Successful execution of the proposed work will at a minimum identify multiple causal variants implicated in GWA studies of erythroid traits and create a public resource of erythroid-specific enhancer activity and important TF binding sites for future studies of erythropoiesis. Additionally, the proposed study establishes not just a new paradigm for high-throughput follow-up of GWA studies in troublesome non- coding regions of the genome, but creates a novel method for investigation of common transcriptional regulatory pathway disruption of cell-type or lineage-specific TFs and master regulators by common genetic variation which can be extended to many different cell types and human diseases."
"9409860","Project Summary Zika virus, until recently an obscure mosquito-borne flavivirus from Africa, has emerged rapidly within the past two years as a major threat to public health in the Western Hemisphere. Having traveled across the Pacific, it has become endemic in Brazil and is expanding its territory northwards in South and Central America, Mexico and the Caribbean, carried by a similarly expanding Aedes mosquito population. While Zika virus infection is generally relatively benign in the acute stage, it is suspected based on growing evidence of causing microcephaly in infants born to infected women, and has been linked to Guillain-Barré syndrome and meningitis in other cases. In addition to transmission by mosquito bite, Zika can likely be transmitted by sexual contact and through blood transfusions. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared Zika to be an international public health emergency, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are actively ramping up efforts to prepare for and respond to the threat posed by Zika in the United States. Accordingly, FDA has advised the temporary deferral of blood donors who have had potential exposure in endemic areas such as Puerto Rico, and has recently approved the use under IND of investigational blood screening assays detecting viral RNA. However, given the very short duration of viremia, most individuals exposed to Zika virus are likely to be negative when tested for viral RNA, and the only means to detect prior exposure and associated health risks is through serologic tests for antibodies to the virus. As the emergence of Zika as a significant human health threat is so recent, there has been no demand for diagnostic assays until now, and commercial products are either non-existent or inadequately validated. This project addresses the critical need for a clinical diagnostic assay for Zika virus infection. The need is further exacerbated by the difficulty in distinguishing Zika from Dengue virus infection given that the two viruses are genetically related, and overlap in mosquito vector and regions of endemicity. In Phase I, we propose to identify peptide epitopes specific for the Zika virus that will enable development of an ELISA allowing accurate serologic identification of Zika infection in individuals beyond the viremic phase, who may also have had exposure to Dengue or other flaviviruses. To accomplish this, we will probe overlapping peptide microarrays derived from Zika proteins with serum samples from individuals with Zika or Dengue infection, confirmed by nucleic acid and immunological assays. Longitudinal sampling from individuals originally identified with acute Zika infection by RNA assays will provide gold standard serum samples with successive IgM and IgG seropositivity for assay development and validation. Immunoreactive peptides will be identified and translated into ELISA test format. In Phase II, we plan to refine this assay into an FDA-cleared, manufactured product for in vitro diagnosis of infected individuals and management and counseling of blood donors."

A multimodal microscope will be used in conjunction with a high sensitivity cancer targeting agent to detect positive margins on lumpectomy specimens. Enhanced contrast fluorescence imaging will be first applied to identify potentially positive margins, while combined high-resolution confocal microscopy-optical coherence tomography imaging will be then used to visualize tissue morphology at the sub-cellular scale and confirm or rule out cancer presence. In Phase I we demonstrated the suitability of this technology for positive cancer margins detection on surgical specimens in a benchtop study.

The TRAP will offer cutting edge approaches to assist investigators in biomarker discovery, assessment and validation. We will provide sophisticated computational analysis, bioinformatics and data management to drive the movement of novel biomarkers into the realm of clinical use for individual based/personalized risk assessment, monitoring of progression or disease, or predicting response to treatment. The TRAP will bridge the gap between bench and clinic with four strategic Services, each designed to address a particular barrier to translation. First, the TRAP will provide study design and biostatistical expertise in the development of pre-clinical and clinical studies. Next, the TRAP will offer services for the ascertainment and procurement of cutaneous tissue and hair follicle samples, a critical resource that has been in high demand at our institution, and we expect will be extensively utilized by resource community members. We will provide links to the National Alopecia Areata Registry Database, thereby allowing access to several thousand individuals who have given consent to be re-contacted for additional research in AA.

"9487411","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a nanofluidic platform for the high-throughput restriction mapping of complete genomes. This platform consists of monolithically integrated fluidics for the extraction of chromosomal DNA from cells, its digestion by restriction endonucleases in a long nanochannel, and the high-resolution sizing of ordered restriction fragments. In contrast to other nanochannel-based approaches, we do not rely on the imaging of highly confined and elongated DNA molecules. Rather, fluorescently labeled DNA is digested by restriction endonucleases in a relatively large diameter (300 - 500 nm) channel in which nanochannel confinement and electrostatic forces prevent diffusive mixing of adjacent fragments. After digestion, the ordered fragments are electrophoretically driven to an injection point where the channel diameter decreases to ~100 nm. As each fragment reaches this point, it is accelerated by the higher electric field, creating separation from its trailing neighbors. Thse separated fragments migrate through a focused laser spot and the duration and integrated intensity of each fluorescence pulse is detected and analyzed to determine fragment size.  We anticipate several advantages to our approach; it relies on nanochannels greater than 100 nm, ensuring that, after prototyping, devices can be fabricated using low-cost, high-throughput methods. The ability to fabricate very long nanochannels with diameters of 300 - 500 nm enables us to confine long genomic DNA in the reaction nanochannel, greatly reducing the need for map assembly from smaller DNA molecules. Integration of DNA extraction on chip increases the probability of interrogating intact chromosomal DNA, eliminating map assembly entirely and providing truly global coverage. Single-point detection obviates the need for image storage and analysis. In addition, many unique opportunities for pre- or post-mapping functionality are possible.  We have conducted preliminary studies demonstrating the ordered injection of fragments from a reaction nanochannel into a smaller detection nanochannel and the ability of this approach to resolve neighboring fragments. Together with other elements developed by the Ramsey group and others, we believe that we would be generating restriction maps during the first half of the proposed project. Consequently, our team includes members with expertise in next generation sequencing (NGS) and bioinformatics. We will validate our restriction maps against reference sequences and physical maps generated using other methods. We will also demonstrate the utility of our restriction maps as scaffolds for de novo assembly of NGS data. Any errors or biases determined from these assessments will direct platform improvements."
"9163948","Project Summary There is an urgent need to develop new therapeutic options for metastatic breast cancer. The goal of this proposal is to help fulfill this need by shedding new light on the molecular pathways driving breast cancer progression and metastasis. Our recently published data indicate that AKT1 phosphorylates S326 of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), the transcription factor known as the master regulator of the heat shock response, leading to HSF1 activation. S326-activated HSF1 increases expression of Slug, an important mediator of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is an early step in metastasis. Our preliminary data further indicate that S326-phosphorylated HSF1 was frequently detected in breast cancer metastases. Pharmacologic inhibition of HSF1 synergizes with an AKT inhibitor to reduce breast cancer cell growth and cancer stem cell self-renewal. These results led us to hypothesize that S326-activated HSF1 contributes to breast cancer progression and the dual targeting of HSF1 and AKT inhibits breast tumor growth and progression. To fully address this hypothesis, we will complete the following three Specific Aims. (1) Determine the effects of HSF1 S326 phosphorylation on breast cancer progression. First, we will assess the effects of S326 phosphorylation on HSF1 activity in breast cancer and the role of different AKT isoforms in HSF1 activation. Second, we will utilize in vitro and in vivo models of breast cancer and in patient tumors to determine the impact of HSF1 S326 phosphorylation on breast tumor growth, progression, and metastasis. (2) Investigate whether pharmacologic inhibition of HSF1, alone and in combination with AKT inhibition, suppresses breast cancer growth and metastasis. First, we will determine whether combined inhibition of HSF1 and AKT targets the treatment-resistant tumor initiating cells using in vitro and in vivo models of breast cancer. Second, we will determine whether this novel treatment strategy suppresses primary breast tumor growth and metastasis using multiple animal models. (3) Identify an AKT-HSF1 pathway activation gene expression signature and use it to predict breast cancer clinical progression and patient outcomes. First, we will identify a gene expression signature indicative of AKT-HSF1 pathway activation. Second, we will use this signature to examine the association between HSF1 activation and patient outcomes. This proposal is significant because it will gain a deeper understanding of breast cancer progression, investigate a novel combination treatment for aggressive breast cancer, and develop a gene expression signature that informs clinical progression and outcomes. This project has conceptual, translational, and technical innovations as it will: i) examine the role of HSF1 as a novel mediator of metastasis, ii) investigate a new therapeutic regimen that simultaneously targets HSF1 and AKT, and iii) develop an HSF1 pathway activation gene expression signature as a novel prognostic indicator for breast cancer survival and response to chemotherapy."
"9340260","Abstract: Project Description The Hispanic/Latino (H/L) population in the US has a disproportionately higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The proposed K01 Mentored Career Development Award to Promote Faculty Diversity will facilitate Dr. Rosalba Hernandez in establishing an independent research career with expertise in therapeutic psychosocial interventions for H/L adults with poor cardiovascular health. But, successful attainment of status as an independent investigator requires further training. Training objectives aim to increase her expertise in: clinical trials design; statistical methodology for randomized trials; physiological mechanisms of the brain-heart interaction and non-invasive cardiology; delivery of positive psychology interventions; and advanced skills in research dissemination and enhanced professional development. Training takes full advantage of the candidate's strong institutional support and environment at the University of Illinois.  Observational studies demonstrate a robust association between positive psychological well-being (or `emotional well-being') and cardiovascular health, but experimental testing is required to assess whether interventions geared toward improving psychological well-being result in enhanced heart health. This proposal consists of two interrelated studies that together explore the link between psychological well-being and cardiac- health, with nuanced exploration of biobehavioral mechanisms. Using data of the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) (n=16,415), we will examine the cross-sectional and prospective association between positive emotional well-being (e.g., optimism) and cardiovascular health, with in-depth exploration of plausible intermediaries such as autonomic nervous system activity, inflammatory biomarkers, and endothelial function. The large and heterogeneous HCHS/SOL cohort data allows identification of effect modifiers such as country of origin and level of acculturation, which is often not feasible in the context of a small experimental trial. We additionally propose implementation of a pilot cluster-randomized trial. A total of 126 H/L adults with uncontrolled hypertension will participate in a pilot cluster-randomized trial testing the efficacy of a positive psychology (PP) intervention. Efficacy of the PP intervention versus an attentional control arm will be assessed primarily for blood pressure, and secondarily for emotional well-being, health behavior adherence, heart rate variability, and C-reactive protein.  The proposed studies will provide preliminary data to conduct a larger fully-powered RCT with pursuit of funding via an R01 mechanism. Dr. Hernandez will obtain critical skills through interdisciplinary mentorship from experts in cardiovascular epidemiology, non-invasive cardiology, and clinical psychology. Experiences gained from the proposed K01-related activities will provide the necessary competences for Dr. Hernandez to become a successful independent investigator."

"9304870","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Susanne Muehlschlegel is a Critical Care Neurologist at the University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS) whose goal is to become an independent investigator with expertise in patient outcome prediction, shared decision making, and decision-science to improve clinical decision making for patients with catastrophic brain injuries and their families. Moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (msTBI) remains the leading cause of death after trauma which mostly follows withdrawal of care. Dr. Muehlschlegel will tackle the life-or-death decision about continuation or withdrawal of care (goals-of-care) in msTBI patients and develop a decision aid for health care proxies of these critically ill patients. Dr. Muehlschlegel's career development plan brings together an outstanding team of investigators from three leading institutions, including the UMMS, University of New England, and University of Pittsburgh. Dr. Muehlschlegel has already obtained preliminary results in msTBI patients confirming that intensive care unit (ICU) complications are associated with worse short-term functional patient outcomes and mortality, and also lead to worse subjective prognostication by clinicians. Based on her daily interactions with families of msTBI patients in her unique clinical position as a neuroICU physician, Dr. Muehlschlegel is acutely aware of the need to improve prognostication and its communication between physicians and families while also including patient's values and preferences. Under the mentorship of Drs. Goldberg, Col, Shutter and Mazor, Dr. Muehlschlegel proposes to: (1a) identify key psychosocial factors of goals-of-care decisions in health care proxies of msTBI patients and physicians in focus groups and structured interviews; (1b) develop a new outcome prediction score for msTBI patients including ICU complications and previously validated admission predictors in a prospectively collected hospital-based cohort of patients with msTBI and to validate her findings internally; (2) create a decision aid prototype for goals-of- care decisions in msTBI patients by incorporating results from Aims 1a and 1b, and the well known and validated msTBI outcome prediction IMPACT score based on hospital admission variables; and (3) to pilot test the decision aid in a feasibility trial in the neuroICU. The overal goal of this proposal is to develop a goals- of-care decision aid that may improve health outcomes for msTBI patients by ensuring proxies receive evidence-based prognostication, understand projected outcomes and risks, while also addressing patient's preferences and values. This well-defined mentored patient-oriented research proposal will bring together cutting-edge qualitative and quantitative methods for decision aid and outcome prediction rule derivation, and a team with expertise in outcomes research, shared decision making, and neurocritical care of msTBI patients. This proposal, in concert with a structured didactic curriculum of advanced statistical, qualitative, and decision- science coursework, will provide Dr. Muehlschlegel with the skills and mentorship that are essential for her to develop an independent career in neuroICU research at the cutting edge of shared decision making science."
"9321433","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proper neural circuit function and behavior requires the establishment of connections between correct synaptic partners, maintenance of connections, and elimination of irrelevant synapses. Increasing evidence suggests that synaptic cell-adhesion molecules are essential for synapse formation. However, molecules essential for universal aspects of synapse formation, as well as molecules underlying the remarkable diversity and specificity of synaptic connections in vivo, remain to be elucidated. Mammalian latrophilins (Lphn1, 2, and 3) are adhesion-type GPCRs that have recently emerged as candidate synaptic cell adhesion molecules by heterophilic binding to teneurins and FLRTs. Lphns are highly enriched in the mammalian brain, and Lphn1 and 3 are transiently upregulated during the massive period of synaptogenesis in the brain. Lphns are also highly conserved across vertebrates and invertebrates, suggesting they may mediate universal aspects of synapse development. Moreover, polymorphisms in Lphn3 are correlated with ADHD, suggesting that Lphn3 regulates information processing. Despite these fascinating properties of Lphns, their precise biological roles in the nervous system remain elusive. We propose to investigate the neuronal function of Lphns by interrogating Lphn constitutive and conditional KO mice with viral-mediated neuronal tracing, histology, electrophysiology, and behavior. Furthermore, we will elucidate the molecular mechanisms of Lphn neuronal function using Lphn structure/function mutants, including polymorphisms associated with ADHD. These studies will provide insight into neuronal adhesion, synapse development, and a common human neurological disorder."
"9377975","Project Summary/Abstract Cadmium (Cd) is a ubiquitous environmental and industrial pollutant that currently ranks seventh on the US EPA/ATSDR Priority List of Hazardous Substances and is a known human carcinogen that causes kidney, liver and bone damage. Cd is associated with diabetes mellitus (DM) and prediabetes in epidemiological and experimental studies. In a study of the US population, 25% of individuals that were diabetic or prediabetic had elevated urinary Cd levels. It is unknown how Cd disrupts blood glucose levels. However, Cd exposure is associated with low serum insulin levels in individuals with occupational exposure and Cd has been shown to impair glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in animal studies. For a large subsection of patients with DM impaired glucose-stimulated insulin, secretion occurs in the progression of type II DM. The overall aim of the proposed project is to determine the mechanism by which Cd causes impaired glucose-stimulated insulin release. Normal insulin secretion and pancreatic ?-cell function are dependent upon cell-cell adhesion; especially important is the role of the calcium-dependent cell adhesion molecule, E-cadherin. Cd has been shown to disrupt E-cadherin mediated cell-cell adhesion in the kidney. Initial studies will establish a range of doses and duration of exposure of Cd that result in necrotic and/or apoptotic cell death in isolated islets and the pancreatic ?-cell line, MIN6. Subsequent studies will be determined if impaired glucose-stimulated insulin release is a response to a generalized Cd-induced oxidative stress response or altered energy status (ADP/ATP) at doses and durations of exposure below those that cause cell death. Live cell imaging studies will be utilized with sensitive fluorophores to detect changes in the production of mediators of oxidative stress. Studies outlined in Aim two will determine the ability of Cd to cause loss of E-cadherin mediated cell-cell adhesion in relation to glucose- stimulated insulin release in isolated islets and the MIN6 cell line. Additional studies will examine the effects of E-cadherin antibodies that bind to the extracellular domain and siRNA of E-cadherin to experimentally disrupt cell-cell adhesion to determine if there are synergistic effects of Cd on inhibiting glucose-stimulated insulin release. Aim three will determine if Cd causes voltage-gated calcium channel blockade resulting in subsequent impaired glucose-stimulated insulin release in isolated islets and MIN6 cells. Additional studies will determine if there are synergistic effects of Cd to impair glucose-stimulated insulin release in the presence or absence of the L-type voltage-gated calcium channel blockers. Also, live cell imaging will be utilized with fluorophores that selectively detect changes of intracellular Cd, zinc or calcium. In Aims two and three, in vivo studies using a well-characterized model of long term Cd poisoning will be used to verify the in vitro findings. Overall, these studies will identify the mechanism of the diabetogenic effects of Cd, a widespread environmental contaminant that is associated with DM and prediabetes."
"9526191","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Particulate matter (PM) air pollution is considered a top-10 contributor to (and the leading environmental risk factor for) the global burden of disease.  To date, evidence on PM health effects has been gathered primarily from medium-to-large scale epidemiology studies, which have traditionally relied upon relatively crude measures of human exposure (i.e., fixed site sampling for PM mass with little to no PM composition analyses). As a result, these studies tend to emphasize the effects of PM on more sedentary populations (such as the elderly) and/or that live close to air monitoring sites. The field now recognizes that air pollution exposure is highly heterogeneous and that exposure measurement error substantially limits the linkage of exposures to specific pathologies. Recently, epidemiologic interest in mobile  populations (e.g., school-aged children or working adults) has increased and the exposure assessment field has shifted towards measures and models of personal exposure to specific PM chemical constituents (and PM properties) suspected to drive human morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately existing technologies for both sampling and analysis are limited by cost, and usability. Thus, a need exists for personal PM sensors that are inexpensive, wearable (with low-burden), yet still highly sensitive and capable of measuring specific PM properties. Our team has developed technology that meets these needs: a small, portable, inexpensive micro environmental sampler and a low cost sensing chemistry that can quantify PM chemical composition both quickly and cost-effectively. During this project, we propose to 1) Evaluate and validate the sampling and analysis methods using laboratory, field, and limited personal exposure studies (R21 phase) and 2) Demonstrate performance and added scientific value through application in the Children's Health and Air Pollution in the San Joaquin Valley (CHAPS-SJV) study (R33 phase). In the first phase, we will demonstrate the usability of our technology by engaging multiple test populations (college students, 9-11 year olds in Fort Collins, CO and high school students in Fresno, CA). In the second phase, we will use the system to provide first of its kinds information on micro environmental exposures and PM composition as it relates to inflammation biomarkers for acute exposures. The resulting data will be used to improve models of air pollution exposure for children in the San Joaquin Valley with the long-term goal of improving the health of these children."
"9349350","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During the last two decades, there has been increased appreciation of the role biomedical and biobehavioral research play in strengthening of systems and understanding of population health. In Uganda most of the biomedical and biobehavioral research is developed and funded by investigators from the developing countries from the US and Europe. Funding agencies have lately developed stringent pre and post award requirements and reporting regulations that require researchers to have certain competencies and skills to be able to meet the set expectations. In Uganda, the majority of research institutions have weak research administration systems, investigators have inadequate skills to compete favorably, the few that are engaged in scientific writing are over burdened by research administrative functions limiting their involvement in grant/research development, and information on available funding opportunities not consistently accessible. Although both Makerere University Walter Reed Project (MUWRP) and the Uganda Cancer Institute (UCI) have implemented NIH funded research in the past, the funding has been secured based on applications developed by US Collaborating institutions and primary grants management activities are carried out in the US utilizing the strong infrastructure at the US institutions. Estimates at the 3 institutions indicate that less than 33% of faculties/technical staff is activel engaging in some form of scientific writing, less than 50% have access to funding source information and less than 40% engage actively with research mentors on a regular basis. Designed as public private partnership (PPP) and to leverage resources at the 3 partner institutions, the proposed Strengthening Institutional Capacity for Research Administration (SICRA) project will strengthen research capacity at the three institutions by strengthening infrastructure for research administration functions, targeted training to improve research development competencies, supporting structural adjustments to create a sustainable research environment, and supporting the development of pre and post award processes. The EA working with guidance from the Mentor will be responsible for the overall leadership of the grant, utilizing resources at MUWRP. The goal of this proposal is to obtain funding to support the strengthening of the research administrative infrastructure and enhance research production in the PPP. Specifically 8 aims have been organized under 3 broad objectives,1) To strengthen research administration leadership primarily at the three participating institutions, 2) To institutionalize a dynamic research administrative support system that provides responsive, efficient, and consistent, support to staff/faculty actively engaged in writing and implementing research proposals at the three participating institutions, and 3) To strengthen institutional research governance structures for program quality and sustainability. By the end of the 5 year grant period a fully functional and responsive office of research and Supported Programs will be in place, grant productions will be growing at a rate of 50% per year, and staff engagement in scientific writing will have improved by more than 50% at all the 3 institutions."
"9069760","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The most common indication for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) in children is high- risk acute leukemia, with equal distribution between acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). With advances in risk-classification, donor tissue typing, conditioning regimen, and transplant care, outcomes for transplant recipients have steadily improved over time. Thus, HCT is now a well-accepted therapy for children with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and many subtypes of high-risk ALL and AML. A key question remains regarding the best approach to the 40-50% of children who do not have matched donors available. Encouraging data have been published recently using unrelated human leukocyte antigen (HLA) - mismatched umbilical cord blood (UCB) in both the adult and pediatric populations. Excellent outcomes were also observed with killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR)-mismatched HLA-haploidentical HCTs. However, no direct comparisons of these two stem cell sources have been performed in children. In this proposal, five participating institutions of the Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplant Consortium (PBMTC) will examine the feasibility and outcome of HCTs in patients who will receive an HLA-mismatched graft because a matched donor is not available. Based on the availability of a KIR-favorable parental donor, the participant will be biologically assigned to receive an HCT from either a KIR-favorable haploidentical donor, or the best alternative donor (typically HLA-mismatched UCB). Specific Aim 1 will assess the disease-free survival at 1 year after transplantation and costs of a favorably KIR-mismatched haploidentical HCT in a multi-center setting. The primary hypothesis is that T- and B-cell-depleted, favorably KIR-mismatched, haploidentical HCT is feasible in a multicenter setting and will result in an 80% DFS at 1 year with acceptable standardized costs and outcomes comparing favorably with unrelated UCB HCTs in the 5 participating centers and in CIBMTR registry. Furthermore, recent data suggest that patients who received a donor graft containing the functionally stronger KIR2DL1 alleles with arginine at amino acid position 245 (KIR2DL1-R245) had better survival and a lower relapse rate than those who received a donor graft that contained only the functionally weaker KIR2DL1 allele with cysteine at the same position (KIR2DL1-C245). Therefore, in Specific Aim 2, we will estimate the effect of donor KIR2DL1 polymorphism on the outcome of HCTs in the context of this clinical trial. The primary hypothesis is that HCT using a KIR2DL1-R245 donor will result in a better survival rate at 1 year than those using a KIR2DL1-C245 graft. If successfully completed, this study will provide high-quality data essential for future improvement of transplant strategies for the large number of children without an HLA-matched donor."

The WU-CDTR has evolved to become a ?network of networks?, with investigators affiliated through a regional resource core with the University of Missouri at Columbia, and two health disparity population cores with the National Congress of American Indians, and the African American Collaborative Obesity Research Network. The WU-CDTR fosters transdisciplinary collaborations, catalyzes new ideas, and supports investigators through six research cores led by national experts in their respective fields that provide distinctive but complementary scientific expertise to inform research with populations at risk for disparities, including: (1) the Dissemination and Implementation in Diabetes Research Core, which advances the study of dissemination and implementation science in diabetes research; (2) the Policy and Systems Science Analysis in Diabetes Research Core, which advances the study of policy- and system-level interventions in diabetes research; (3) the Health Communication and Health Literacy Core, which advances the study of health communication science to test strategies for addressing health disparities in diabetes research; (4) the Health Informatics in Diabetes Research Core, which advances the development and application of healthcare informatics in translational diabetes research; (5) the Research Partnerships with American Indian/Alaska Native Communities Core, which increases the capacity of researchers to engage in translational research with American Indian and Alaska Native communities; and (6) the Solutions to Diabetes in Black Americans Core, which provides methodological and content expertise to support research with the Black population. The WU-CDTR supports a vibrant Pilot and Feasibility Program designed to attract and retain new investigators as well as established investigators new to the field; and it also supports an Enrichment Program that promotes transdisciplinary research, learning opportunities, and mentorship for young investigators. Evidence that the WU-CDTR has been successful in pursuing the mission includes a record of outstanding productivity reflected by publications and funding in diabetes and related research. Success is also measured by the growth of our research base of established and new diabetes investigators, and underrepresented racial minority investigators. The WU-CDTR is positioned as the nexus for transdisciplinary team science and transformative diabetes research addressing multiple dimensions of diabetes disparities."
"9526080","Obesity is one of the most serious public health problems in the US; its prevalence has tripled in the last three decades and is associated with a range of short- and long-term medical and psychosocial problems. Adolescence is a critical period for the development and persistence of obesity, and is associated with changes in diet, physical activity and fitness, fat distribution and insulin sensitivity. There are racial and sex-specific disparities in the prevalence and burden of obesity. African-American (AA) females have the highest rates of obesity, and the clustered risk factors for coronary heart disease and metabolic syndrome are twice that of AA males. The reasons for racial and sex-specific disparities in the prevalence and burden of obesity are not well understood. AA experience higher stress levels than Non-Hispanic Whites (NHW) due to economic and social inequalities, and the effect of stress on energy-dense diet and adiposity is more prominent in females. A better understanding of the mechanisms that link stress to obesity, particularly during adolescence when high rates of obesity, increased stressful experiences and stronger behavioral and physiological responses to stress emerge, will contribute to new clinical guidelines for reducing obesity and associated medical conditions in AA females.  The Physiological stress system affects obesity and mediates its adaptive functions via hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Prolonged stress-induced glucocorticoid secretion promotes the consumption of energy-dense diet (EI) and abdominal fat deposition both directly and indirectly through its effects on metabolic hormones. Stress also reduces physical activity and alters energy balance. The proposed study will examine the effects of stress and HPA axis on EI and physical activity-related energy expenditure in 100 AA and 100 NHW adolescent females. The effects on EI will be assessed in two contexts, the natural environment and under controlled conditions incorporating a standardized psychosocial stressor. Stress will be assessed in the natural environment as multiple domains (i.e., individual, family and social), and several indices of the HPA axis will be obtained to represent diurnal variation, its status over 12-15 weeks and reactivity to stress. Obesity- related parameters will be measured through anthropometry, fat distribution and cardio-metabolic biomarkers.  Associations among stress, HPA activity/function, energy balance and obesity-related parameters will be compared between and within AA and NHW samples. In combination they will improve our understanding of the social factors and biobehavioral mechanisms of both racial and individual differences in obesity and facilitate the development of effective treatments within and across racial groups according to the principles of individualized medicine. To our knowledge, racial differences in objectively-measured diet intake and energy expenditure in response to stress, or their underlying physiological mechanisms, have not been assessed in adolescents or adults. This is an important knowledge gap in our efforts to develop better evidence-based translational obesity prevention and weight-control interventions as the traditional interventions are not effective with minority youth."
"9390544","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Background: Surgery for hip fracture can be devastating for older adults, with complications including delirium, increased risk of dementia, and inability to walk. As an anesthesiologist and clinician-scientist, I have focused on reducing delirium after surgery. In this proposal, I will build the foundation for a research career focused on the broader goals of reducing neurocognitive and functional decline after surgery in older adults. I will specifically focus on the role of optimizing intraoperative cerebral perfusion, because of pilot data suggesting that reduced cerebral perfusion during surgery is a modifiable risk factor for delirium. Career Development Plan: I am proposing specific educational goals that address gaps in my current knowledge. First, I will develop expertise in cerebrovascular physiology and monitoring under the mentorship of Dr. Koehler, an expert in cerebral blood flow regulation. Second, I will develop expertise in neurocognitive testing and dementia assessment under the mentorship of Dr. Kamath, a neuropsychologist, and Dr. Gottesman, an expert in dementia adjudication in the research setting. Third, I will gain expertise in clinical trials and measuring functional status through the mentorship of Drs. Sieber and Neuman (experts in perioperative clinical trials in older adults), and Dr. Walston (a geriatrician with expertise in functional status). Finally, I will develop as a leader through interactions with my mentors, courses, and leadership opportunities. Research Proposal: During hip fracture surgery, extreme variations in blood pressure are common in older adults, who are susceptible to cerebral ischemia and vulnerable to consequences of hypotension. However, there is no standard of care as to what constitutes adequate blood pressure during surgery. Our group has championed methodology to define optimal blood pressure in individual patients by real-time monitoring of cerebral autoregulation. Using these methods in cardiac surgery, we have shown that mean arterial pressure (MAP) below the limits of cerebral autoregulation is associated with postoperative morbidity, and that an intervention to target intraoperative MAP based on this monitoring may reduce delirium. Although promising, these results in cardiac surgery may not apply in hip fracture surgery. To address this gap in knowledge, I will extend these methods to hip fracture surgery patients. I will characterize (a) the extent of, and (b) risk factors for intraoperative MAP variation above and below the limits of cerebral autoregulation during hip fracture surgery (Aim 1). I will also examine associations of MAP variation with neurocognitive and functional outcomes (Aim 2). Based on these results, I will design a pilot feasibility/safety trial to determine whether targeting MAP within the limits of autoregulation could improve neurocognitive/functional outcomes (Aim 3). Summary: Promising results from this proposal would support a definitive trial, which would have the potential to fundamentally alter anesthetic strategies across a wide range of surgical populations. The educational plan in this proposal will support my career goal of improving outcomes for older adults after surgery."
"9233494","The major goal of this grant application is to test a novel hypothesis that age-related changes in the dermal extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment promote skin cancer development. Cancer is a disease of aging. For example, keratinocyte skin cancer, the most common form of human cancer, rarely occurs in individuals under the age of 40, but very common in the elderly. The importance of stromal connective tissue microenvironment in epithelial cancer is receiving increased recognition. However, the concept that natural aging brings about changes in the ECM microenvironment that promote cancer development has received little attention. In human skin, dermal fibroblasts are responsible for homeostasis of the collagenous ECM, which comprises the bulk of skin. Our recent studies reveal that aged dermal fibroblasts in vivo, express elevated levels of a protein called CCN1 (first member of CCN family proteins), which is secreted and binds to the dermal ECM. We find that elevated CCN1 up-regulates numerous proteins related to senescence-associate secretory phenotype (SASP), and thus promotes dermal connective tissue aging. These alterations include: 1) reduced levels of collagens, which causes dermal thinning; 2) elevated levels of multiple collagen-degrading enzymes, which cause increased fragmentation of ECM; and 3) increased levels of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines, which contributes to dermal inflammaging. Importantly, all of these CCN1-indced alterations are readily observed in aged human skin in vivo. Based on these considerations, we have created a transgenic mouse model that expresses CCN1 under control of a fibroblast-specific promoter, the source of elevated CCN1 in aged human skin (col-CCN1TG). These mice display alterations of the dermal ECM microenvironment by secretion of SASP-related genes. In the transgenic mice, skin is thin, finely wrinkled, and collagen fibrils are fragmented and disorganized, as observed in aged human skin. Importantly, these mice display a high propensity for skin tumor formation elicited by two- stage carcinogenesis protocol. Based on these data, we hypothesize that age-associated dermal ECM microenvironment promotes epithelial tumor development. This application will test the above hypothesis using a novel cell-type-specific double-transgenic mouse model, in which the epidermal oncogene Ras is specifically expressed in the skin epithelium and aged-associated dermal ECM microenvironment is generated by fibroblast-specific expression of CCN1. The proposed studies will directly investigate the novel concept that age-associated dermal ECM microenvironment promotes skin cancer development in cooperation with epithelial oncogene, and thus may have profound impact on the field of cancer prevention/treatment in the aged by identifying age-associated dermal microenvironment as a key target for therapeutic intervention."
"9470290","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The skin provides the first line of innate immune protection against pathogens by producing antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Staphylococcus aureus is an important bacterial pathogen that is resisted by AMPs but remains responsible for the majority of serious skin infections in humans. Unfortunately, the growing obesity epidemic has further increased this risk for skin and soft tissue infections, but the mechanism responsible for the decreased defense against microbes is not well understood. This proposal seeks to better understand both normal skin immune defense and why obesity is associated with skin infections by advancing our recent discovery that dermal white adipose tissue (DWAT) is a major source of AMPs in the skin. This potent immune defense function of DWAT was previously unsuspected, but we have shown it to be a key layer for host defense by the skin against S. aureus. Since dysfunction of adipose tissue is known to occur in obesity, we hypothesize that an abnormality in DWAT innate immune functions are part of the loss of function of the adipose in obesity. Our investigations will advance this hypothesis by defining the molecular mechanisms responsible for AMP production by adipocytes and then investigating these functions in mouse models of obesity. This approach will permit us to test our hypothesis that AMP dysfunction in DWAT contributes to increase in S. aureus susceptibility and advance the understanding of fundamental skin immunity. This work may also open new therapeutic avenues for improving the global burden of S. aureus skin infection as compounded by the obesity epidemic. Three aims will be investigated in this project to advance our overall goals: 1. Define how DWAT is activated during host defense. We will determine whether DWAT are activated by bacterial products produced by S. aureus and/or inflammatory signal from the recruited myeloid cells. 2. Define the mechanisms by which DWAT provides cutaneous immune defense. We hypothesize that DWAT influences defense by both producing antimicrobial molecules and modulating inflammation. To test this, we will determine whether cathelicidin is the major antimicrobial peptide produced by adipocytes, and we will also characterize how skin inflammation is regulated by DWAT using mouse models with impaired adipogenesis. 3. Determine the impact of obesity on the innate immune function of DWAT. We hypothesize that AMP dysfunction in DWAT is the key factor driving S. aureus susceptibility in obesity. We will determine how diet-induced obesity (DIO) impairs dermal adipogenesis and we will determine potential therapeutic approach targeting (pre)adipocytes to restore normal skin defense in obesity."
"9385076","Abstract !  The work outlined in this revised proposal for the Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Award (K08) will provide the training and mentorship necessary for the candidate to develop into an independent investigator and expert in the immunological consequences of CKD, specifically in relation to cardiovascular comorbidities. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death for the nearly 20 million Americans living with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Uremic cardiomyopathy, characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and diastolic dysfunction, predicts mortality among patients with CKD. The underlying mechanisms contributing to the development of uremic cardiomyopathy are incompletely understood, limiting treatment options. The literature suggests that the accumulation of pro-inflammatory T cells during CKD confer risk for cardiovascular disease via unknown mechanisms, leading us to further explore a role for T cells in uremic cardiomyopathy. We have exciting preliminary data suggesting T cells mechanistically underlie the pathological cardiac changes in an experimental model of CKD. Our overarching hypothesis is that T cells altered by uremia contribute to cardiac remodeling during CKD.  The scientific approach in this proposal utilizes a murine model of CKD that results in uremic cardiomyopathy (LVH and diastolic dysfunction) and accumulation of pro-inflammatory T cells. First, we will identify the differential role of the two major subsets of T cells (CD4+ and CD8+) in the pathogenesis of uremic cardiomyopathy. Next, we propose interrogating the role of T cells bearing the co-inhibitory receptors, PD-1 or KLRG1, in uremic cardiomyopathy via adoptive transfer studies and the necessity of the PD-1 signaling pathway using antibody blockade in vivo. Finally, we will investigate the contribution of the co-stimulatory pathway, OX40, including how it relates to the up-regulation of KLRG1 and PD-1 in T cells during CKD. This work will provide important mechanistic insight into the role of T cells during uremic cardiomyopathy, paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies in patients with CKD.  We have assembled of a team of NIH-funded mentors with diverse and complementary expertise to support the candidate?s development in three scientific domains: immunology, cardiovascular biology, and chronic kidney disease. The career development plan is structured to expand knowledge in immunology, master advanced experimental methods in immunology, further develop skills in experimental methods in cardiovascular biology, mature skills in scientific communication, and lay a foundation to enable translation of basic science discoveries in the future. The candidate?s primary mentor, Dr. Mandy Ford, is a classically- trained immunologist with expertise in T cell memory development and costimulatory signaling. Dr. Ahsan Husain, as co-mentor, will provide expertise in cardiovascular biology, and Dr. Larry Greenbaum will assist me in forming relationships and project ideas for future translational studies. !"
"9283081","Dogs and humans are the only species in which naturally occurring malignant gliomas are common. Effective therapeutics for malignant glioma represents a major unmet need in medicine, as the prognosis for dogs and humans with malignant gliomas remains poor. We and others have described the clinical, imaging, histomorphologic, and molecular similarities shared between canine and human gliomas. Our collaborative efforts have identified that canine gliomas overexpress interleukin 13 receptor alpha 2 (IL-13RA2), and EphA2/EphA3 analogous to what has been found in human glioblastoma (GBM). Further we have been actively investigating novel methods for loco-regional drug delivery to the brain, such as real-time MRI monitored convection enhanced delivery, photothermotherapy, and electroporation-based approaches, and have demonstrated the safety and feasibility of these therapeutic platforms in dogs with spontaneous gliomas. Core 3 will provide the veterinary clinical and regulatory expertise and support to enable use of client-owned dogs with spontaneous gliomas as a unique and unifying model system for the pre-clinical evaluation and translation of the novel therapeutic approaches developed in Projects 1-4. We will specifically support the projects through three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will generate IACUC protocols and obtain institutional approvals to harvest canine tissues for use in in vitro experiments, as well as to perform the in vivo clinical studies in client-owned dogs with gliomas described in Specific Aims 3 of both Projects 2 and 3. In Aim 2, we will collect, clinically annotate, and bank canine glioma tissue specimens. These tissues will be distributed to PPG project investigators to characterize the expression and distribution of IL-13RA2, EphA2, EphA3, and EphB2 receptors in canine glioma for validation of targeting canine gliomas with the QUAD-CTX multivalent and Pep1L-CTX cytotoxins, and optimize the electrical field thresholds required for tumor ablation using high- frequency irreversible electroporation (H-FIRE). In Aim 3, we will provide the veterinary clinical and neurosurgical expertise necessary to conduct pre-clinical studies to evaluate the ability of our innovative technological platforms, the H-FIRE and convection-enhanced thermo-chemotherapy systems (CETCS), to deliver the novel targeted cytotoxic drug conjugates, QUAD-CTX and Pep-1L-CTX generated in Project 1, to naturally occurring intracranial gliomas in dogs, and to provide procedural training and oversight of the H-FIRE treatment, GBM resection, and convection-enhanced delivery in the rodent models described in Projects 3 and 4."

The main objectives of TARPS are to provide a mechanism to simplify, streamline, and standardize the  process of research tissue accrual and disbursement, and to provide efficient research pathology support  services. The tissue accrual and disbursement function of TARPS originated in 1991 as a small service facility,  with a focus on genitourinary cancers. The resource has substantially expanded in the last 23 years and now  procures and disburses tissue materials from patients with a diverse array of cancers, providing support to  major research projects such as the Specialized Programs Of Research Excellence (SPORE) in Head and  Neck, Lung, Ovary and Skin Cancers; the Early Disease Research Network (EDRN)-related research efforts;  the Hematology-Oncology Service, and several other cancer research programs. The specific aims of TARPS  are to: 1) Provide tissue and biological specimen procurement services. This includes procurement and  preservation of tissue and biological specimens; storage and filing of specimens and downstream retrieval of  specimens for researchers; providing appropriately sub-sampled tissue specimens with appropriate Quality  assurance and Quality control of specimens; and associated data, as per the needs of the project. 2) Provide  research histology services. This includes routine processing of tissue samples; design and manufacture  paraffin tissue microarrays (TMAs); evaluation of novel antibodies and establishing protocols;  immunohistochemical staining of conventional and TMA tissue sections, using an automated platform; and  Quantitative Image Analysis and Morphometry services, when needed. 3) Annotate samples with clinical data.  Data annotation is per needs of the project. TARPS utilizes resources including EMR, Pathology LIS and the  UPMC Cancer Registry database for these data annotation services. 4) Provide whole slide imaging and  image analysis services. TARPS has played a major role in the TCGA program having provided more than  1000 cases. Services provided by TARPS include: (1) tissue and biological specimen procurement, (2)  research histology, (3) annotation of samples with clinical data, and (4) Tissue Micro-Array (TMA) facilities (5)  Quantitative Image analysis and whole slide Imaging.. Future efforts include the development of a large array  of TMA blocks from the TCGA cases to facilitate leveraging the molecular data generated. We are also  engaged in the development of new protocols to enable profiling of numerous markers on a single slide.  During the current project period investigators from all 10 Research Programs used TARPS."

Project Summary- REC The purpose of the Research Education Core (REC) is to foster the career development of junior faculty from multiple disciplines into academic scientists in gerontology and geriatrics, focusing on theme of exercise and activity-based rehabilitation and recovery research. The REC supports mentor-based research training and education to promote the career development of REC Scholars as well as other junior faculty, fellows and students pursuing research careers in aging. The UM-OAIC has a successful history of mentored training that crosses traditional disciplinary boundaries to develop novel research for improving function and independence in older persons. This has enriched the cadre of scientists at UM and elsewhere conducting aging research in exercise and rehabilitation science. The UM-OAIC RCDC, now REC, has evolved over 20 years to develop unique components, and is innovative in that it: attracts and brings junior faculty from multiple departments, medical subspecialties, and schools at UM in Baltimore and Baltimore County together to pursue interdisciplinary research and research training in aging; uses research working groups (RWG) individualized to each trainee to pursue and facilitate interdisciplinary studies focused on translational research projects; integrates OAIC programs with other career development programs at the University of Maryland, including the Office of Research Career Development and the Clinical Research Education and Training Program; and develops individualized career development plans and RWGs to guide and measure Scholar?s progress. The specific aims of the REC are to: a). recruit, select and support REC scholars; b). mentor REC scholars and affiliated scholars; c). provide career development opportunities in areas relevant to aging research and d. evaluate the activities of the REC. The REC?s comprehensive research training program has developed junior scholars trained with skills at the bench and in the conduct of clinical research, poised to translate clinical problems into mechanistic studies, and laboratory findings into clinical application in the elderly. That is why our scholars are so successful in the receipt of federal career development awards (NIH Ks and VA CDAs), and subsequent independent research funding and academic promotion."
"9358307","This is a renewal of a highly synergistic PPG exploring tolerance induction for xenotransplantation. Themes include: 1) Tolerance of the adaptive immune system; 2) Overcoming innate immune barriers; and 3) Using advanced genetic engineering techniques to improve genetically modified (GM) MGH inbred miniature swine. In Project 1, ?Achieving Xenograft Tolerance through Thymic Programming in Primates?, we will study and attempt to avoid the proteinuria which limits GalT-KO pig kidney transplant survival in baboons; we will optimize tolerance and protective immunity by transplanting a hybrid vascularized thymus (VT) containing pig and baboon TECs and combine this with mixed xenogeneic chimerism with intra-bone injection of pig bone marrow to simultaneously tolerize both adaptive and innate immunity. In Project 2, ?Achieving Xenograft Tolerance through Mixed Chimerism?, which also uses the pig-to-baboon model, we have achieved prolonged mixed chimerism in baboon recipients of human CD47 (hCD47) Tg pig hematopoietic cells (HCs), resulting in remarkably prolonged pig skin graft survival; we will combine this approach with intrabone injection of hCD47 Tg/hCD55 Tg/GalT KO pig hematopoietic cells and use ex-vivo expanded recipient Tregs to enhance engraftment, aiming to achieve more durable chimerism and, with it, tolerance of B, NK and T cells; we will also test HCs from new GM swine produced in Project 4. Project 3, ?Tolerance of Adaptive and Innate Human Anti-Pig Immune Responses in Humanized Mice?, combines mixed xenogeneic chimerism and porcine thymic transplantation in humanized mice with robust human immune systems; we will combine engineered pig/human hybrid thymi with mixed xenogeneic chimerism to achieve multi-faceted immune tolerance along with protective immunity for both human and porcine tissues; we will determine the impact of the hCD47 Tg on induction of porcine mixed chimerism in these mice and determine the impact of duration of this mixed chimerism on human T, B and NK cell tolerance. In Project 4, ?Improving Xenogeneic Chimerism and Tolerance through Genome Engineering Technology?, advanced genetic engineering techniques will be used to generate two optimal GM pig lines, one for tolerance induction and the other for organ transplantation, on a background of inbred miniature swine with common GMs that will be needed for both purposes. Core A will provide administrative support for the PPG, facilitating interactions between the primary and subcontract sites. Core B will support all large animal needs, including non-human primates and GM MGH inbred miniature swine; provide support for infectious diseases, coagulation and clotting issues of swine and baboons; and provide mAbs and antisera. The synergism of these projects and cores and the fertile interactions among them should bring us closer to the goal of clinical xenotransplantation."
"9408878","PROJECT SUMMARY The objective of this proposal is to develop potent and selective inhibitors of the kinase, DYRK1A, to treat mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). A compelling body of data points to hyperphosphorylated tau species as mediators of toxicity in AD. p-Tau species may significantly impact a number of cellular events. Prominently, they participate in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), whose presence is closely linked with disease progression. An important question that remains is how tau is hyperphosphorylated. DYRK1A is a dual specificity kinase for which tau serves as a substrate. DYRK1A activity may be involved in AD pathogenesis because: (1) DYRK1A is a kinase for which tau serves as substrate; (2) it is robustly expressed in CNS neurons; (3) increased DYRK1A immunoreactivity is found in AD in the cytoplasm and nucleus of neurons of the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus and neocortex; (4) its presence there is associated with increased phosphorylation of tau; (5) DYRK1A-induced phosphorylation of tau reduces tau's ability to stabilize microtubules; and (6) DYRK1A-induced phosphorylation of tau promotes self-aggregation and fibrillization. Significantly, DYRK1A `primes' tau for additional phosphorylation by GSK3? kinase which is known to contribute to AD pathogenesis. These findings support our hypothesis that inhibition of DYRK1A activity will be disease-modifying and significantly impact on the lives of those with AD. In spite of a role for p-tau in AD pathogenesis, few pharmaceutical industry efforts are targeting the modulation of DYRK1A. Avanti Biosciences is specifically and uniquely focused on DYRK1A and aims to discover small molecule DYRK1A negative modulators derived from natural catechins. The main ingredient of green tea, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), is a potent allosteric negative modulator of DYRK1A that results in decreased kinase activity. Unfortunately, EGCG is relatively unstable metabolically and achieves low brain exposure. To discover new catechins that exert the same activity with improved drug-like properties, we characterized the catechins in green tea and discovered that EGCG was not the most potent catechin. In fact, the trans catechin derivatives Gallocatechin gallate (GCG) and Catechin gallate (GC) were more potent, more stable and may achieve better brain exposure. We propose to modify these natural catechins to improve potency, metabolic stability, and brain bioavailability. Selected lead compounds will be validated as negative modulators of DYRK1A activity in vitro and in the rTg4510 tauopathy model. These studies are intended to support future IND enabling studies of potent negative modulators of DYRK1A and eventual AD clinical trials."

"9335176","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Drug addiction is a prevalent and chronically relapsing disorder that affects millions of Americans. Our laboratory has recently developed a behavioral economics (BE) paradigm that determines individual motivation for cocaine and propensity for drug relapse in a single testing session. In this paradigm, the neuropeptide orexin (also called hypocretin) is involved in driving motivation for cocaine. Lateral hypothalamus (LH) orexin neurons are highly associated with motivation for reward and project to numerous reward-associated brain regions. However, it remains unclear how LH orexin neurons are recruited to drive motivation for cocaine. Rostral lateral septum (LS) strongly innervates the LH orexin cell field and has been linked to orexin- dependent, stimulus-associated cocaine seeking. The ability of orexin to drive motivation for cocaine also may involve its extensive projections to ventral tegmental area (VTA), a region highly implicated in reward, motivation, and drug addiction. Using a within-session BE paradigm, this proposal will explore the role of LS inputs to LH orexin neurons and LH orexin projections to VTA DA neurons in demand for cocaine. I predict that both of these projections will be necessary for cocaine demand in the BE paradigm. This hypothesis will be tested using three Specific Aims. Aim 1 will determine individual differences in neuronal activity of the LS-LH orexin and LH orexin-VTA circuits using retrograde tract tracing combined with Fos staining in both LS projections to LH, and LH projections to VTA following BE. Aim 2 will utilize pharmacological and morpholino antisense approaches to specifically inhibit the LS-LH orexin circuit and determine its role in cocaine demand. Aim 3 will combine pharmacological, antisense, and chemogenetic approaches to inhibit LH orexin input to VTA DA neurons during BE performance.  Together, these studies will elucidate the inputs and outputs of LH orexin neurons involved in cocaine demand to uncover neuropathology underlying drug addiction. This fellowship will train the applicant in several innovative techniques in systems and behavioral neuroscience, including chemogenetic, pharmacological, and antisense manipulations; drug self-administration and behavioral economics paradigms; cannulae and catheter surgeries; and immunohistochemical procedures.  "
"9386817","PROJECT SUMMARY Antibodies are critical components of immune defense and are mediators of vaccine-elicited protection as well as autoimmunity. The heavy and light chains that comprise an antibody molecule are encoded by germline immunoglobulin (Ig) gene fragments that recombine and undergo somatic mutation thereby generating billions of specificities able to contend with a multitude of foreign antigens. The majority of the diversity lies within the antigen-binding (Fab) portion of antibodies although variation also exists within the conserved (Fc) region of the heavy chain that interacts with cellular receptors to mediate non-neutralizing functions. Diversity within both regions impacts on antibody function. Given the protective role of antibodies in HIV and other infections, we propose to mine the depth of the antibody repertoire and study how Fc diversity impacts antiviral activity. It is well known that Africans are more genetically diverse than other populations and yet there is a scarcity of data on African genomes including Ig genes. Our preliminary data using samples from an ethnic Zulu population residing in South Africa has revealed that approximately half of the heavy chain variable (IGHV) genes as well as a significant number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Fc are not recorded in public databases. Many of these novel IGHV alleles occur at high frequency and in some cases are highly expressed. Importantly, we have shown that they are used to make functional antibodies. We hypothesize that there is significant undiscovered variability within the African Ig gene repertoire some of which will impact on the functionality of anti-HIV antibodies. To explore this, we propose to sequence the entire rearranged, antigen-naïve heavy and light variable chain gene repertoires in 40 individuals of Zulu ethnicity using Illumina MiSeq. Data will be analyzed using a new bioinformatics tool called IgDiscover that will enable the identification of novel and known germline variable and joining region gene segments from both heavy and light chains that are expressed by functional antibodies. Variability in the Fc region of IgG and IgA will be analyzed using SNP analysis in 100 Zulu individuals. Furthermore, the Fc regions from individuals with novel IgG3 SNPs will be sequenced and used to make fully native antibodies for functional studies, including antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), phagocytosis and neutralization. In this way the diversity within both the Fab and Fc regions will be analyzed and the impact on function assessed. This project will contribute new knowledge on African germline immunoglobulin genes, which is essential for a fully comprehensive immunogenetics database. These studies will be of great benefit to the HIV research community as they embark on major vaccine efficacy trials as well as to others studying the immune responses to infection, vaccination, cancer and auto-immunity in this population."

The goal is for trainees to gain an understanding of and experience working on statistical issues for these two important areas of toxicology. These trainees will be qualified to hold unique positions in governmental agencies, academia, and industry where properly evaluating risks associated with relevant chemical exposures is becoming increasingly important. The trainees will be Ph.D. students in the Department of Biostatistics at the Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU), where they will pursue pre-doctoral training in the discipline of biostatistics. Additional expertise will be achieved through work on dissertation/research topics that are pertinent to the field of mixtures or toxicogenomics and through collaborative work with toxicologists and/or environmental epidemiologists actively working in their area of interest. Through these research projects, students will gain experience collaborating with a team of experts working to understand the relationship between environmental exposures and human disease susceptibility. The trainees will assist in the design of studies, conduct appropriate power analyses, analyze resulting data, write reports with proper interpretation of the results, and participate in a collaborative team to produce one or more manuscripts for peer-review publication.

"9459529","Many chronic diseases are complex and very heterogeneous. They can be affected by multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors, and patients of one disease can be divided into subgroups, e.g., cancer subtypes or stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). One can use the genome-wide gene expression data to investigate these disease's molecular signatures, which may help understand disease etiology and guide precise treatments. Graphical models are powerful tools to estimate complex network interactions among a large number of genes. To develop biostatistical and machine learning methods to estimate such directed graphical models using gene expression data is the primary goal of this project. To this end, this project contains the following research activities: (1) Given known disease subtypes, Aim 1 develops novel techniques to jointly estimate multiple undirected/directed graphical models with one model per subtype. (2) In Aim 2, we consider the situation where disease subtypes are not defined a prior. We propose to identify disease subtypes by gene expression clustering, and the uncertainty of clustering is incorporated into the estimation of multiple directed graphical models in Aim 1. (3) Recent single cell RNAsequencing technology enables researchers to profile multiple cells from the same patient. Aim 3 focuses on estimating multiple directed graphical models (e.g., for multiple subclones of tumor cells, or multiple types of brain cells) using single cell RNA-seq data of one patient. The effectiveness of the proposed graphical model estimation methods will be demonstrated using cancer and AD data analysis. The research results have great potential to offer new insights on the understanding and precise treatments of these diseases. Furthermore, these methods are general enough to be applied to analyze omic data of other diseases as well. The research team will disseminate computational efficient and user-friendly software packages, research publications, academic presentations and collaborations with experts in cancer research and neurological diseases."
"9328006","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Core 2 We will establish a core facility for in vivo cancer modeling and screening. This core facility (core 2 in the cancer systems biology center) will consist of several sets of functional components, defined as modules, including vector design and genome-scale library construction, large-scale cell culture and virus production, tumor transplantation and in vivo pooled screening, CRISPR/Cas9 mediated somatic genome editing for invasive phenotype analysis. In preliminary studies, we have applied in vivo somatic genome editing to generate tumor models of specific driver genes in mice, and demonstrated in vivo screening in a lung metastasis animal model. We will build four modules in this core, including the following: Module 1. Facility for vector design and genome-scale library construction. This module supports functional investigations of the mammalian genome that can reveal how genetic alterations lead to changes in phenotype, for example cellular invasiveness phenotype described in the Projects 1 and 2. Module 2. Facility for large-scale cell culture, viral vector production and transduction. This will serve for two purposes: (1) generation of customized viral particles for in vivo studies involving animals models for Projects 1 and 2 as well as other collaborators; (2) high-throughput screening applications that requires transduction of a population of cells with highly complex libraries. Module 3. Facility for tumor transplantation and in vivo pooled screening. This module will setup a facility with two capacities: (1) tumor transplantation and (2) in vivo pooled screening. This will serve for the purpose of validating the genes discovered in the projects in mouse models, to discover new genes with invasive phenotypes using in vivo screens, or to enable collaborative research for discovery of new drug targets. Module 4. Facility for CRISPR/Cas9 mediated somatic genome editing, for somatic genome editing in various animals for virtually any loci in the mouse genome. We will establish this platform and utilize it for research described in the projects and for setting up collaborations with various Yale investigators. Specifically, we will utilize CRISPR library approach in conjunction with the Rapid Analysis of Cell migration Enhancement (RACE) system described in the Projects, to identify how genetic alterations lead to changes in cellular invasiveness phenotype. In addition, we will utilize these modules in the core to build novel models of WNK1, NKCC1 and their targets, as well as combinations of mutant ERK, AKT and downstream genes. In summary, this core will be tightly integrated into the U54 center, provide a powerful technology and resource platform for in vivo cancer systems biology, and support Research Projects in the center as well as other collaborators at Yale and the wider scientific community. Since there is no facility currently existing at Yale providing similar functions, this new core will facilitate the establishment of the first in vivo cancer modeling and screening core facility at Yale.

"9345612","1 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  2 (No longer than 30 lines of text) 3 Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained dysrhythmia worldwide. Although new AF 4 treatment strategies have emerged over the last decade, a major challenge facing clinicians and  5 researchers is the paroxysmal, often short-lived, and frequently asymptomatic nature of AF. Paroxysmal  6 and asymptomatic AF would be found in a growing percentage of our population if it were detectable, and  7 causes major long-term health consequences despite being so silent. There is, therefore, a pressing need to  8 develop an inexpensive device for long-term, continuous monitoring containing an accurate real-time AF  9 detection algorithm, to lower our nation's healthcare costs. Such a device would not only increase rates of 10 detection in symptomatic patients and allow for better evaluation of treatment efficacy, but could become 11 widely-adopted enough to flush out asymptomatic people, if coupled with a strong awareness campaign. 12 Given the ever-growing popularity of wearable devices, our approach to AF detection using leadless 13 wearable armbands and a smartphone app will give patients as well as health care providers the 14 opportunity to monitor for AF under the wide variety of conditions in a patient's real life. We want to make 15 a device the user can truly live in, long term. Because our approach does not involve ECG leads, it will be 16 minimally obtrusive, thereby leading to better acceptance and use by patients. Our wearable device has 17 the potential to disrupt the traditional delivery of AF healthcare. For this objective to be successfully 18 achieved, four key technology pillars must be commercialized. The first is an accurate AF detection 19 algorithm. The second is a reusable, rugged, flexible electrode material that does not cause skin irritation 20 with prolonged use in all real-world conditions. The third is an accurate motion artifact removal 21 algorithm. The fourth is leadless ECG capture. The first two technological developments have been 22 achieved by our company's CTO. Our AF algorithm has been shown to be accurate in multiple peer- 23 reviewed publications, and is now commercially available in a Holter monitor from Scottcare Corporation. 24 We have also developed novel waterproof, flexible, gel-less, reusable electrodes that do not cause skin 25 irritation. Hence, the objective of this SBIR project is to bring to maturity the last two pillar technologies. 26 Preliminary work on concepts for both show great promise. We believe this work will result in rapid 27 translation in later Phases into an innovative and disruptive AF detection product. The envisioned product 28 has the potential to significantly reduce healthcare costs by accurately and more succinctly establishing the 29 diagnosis of AF in at-risk groups, thereby providing clinicians with an opportunity to prevent expensive 30 secondary complications of these life-threatening arrhythmias."
"9506917","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to determine how growth and polarity are regulated in developing tissues to form organs of appropriate size and shape. We will investigate two processes that play fundamental yet incompletely understood roles in controlling organ size and shape: Ds-Fat signaling and cytoskeletal tension. A remarkable feature of Ds-Fat signaling is that it can be regulated by the vector and slope of Dachsous (Ds) and Four-jointed (Fj) gradients to influence distinct downstream processes that control planar cell polarity (PCP) and, through regulation of Hippo signaling, growth. These gradients polarize Fat activity within cells, as can be visualized by the polarization of the Fat signaling component Dachs. Characterization of this pathway will provide novel insights into the control of cell behavior, and how patterning and growth can be linked during development. It has also been proposed that mechanical forces could play roles in modulating organ size and shape, but the mechanisms by which this occurs are not well understood. Recent studies however, including our characterization of the regulation and role of the Jub protein, have implicated the Hippo signaling pathway in regulation of growth by mechanical forces.  The studies proposed here will enhance molecular understanding of how patterning, e.g. as provided by morphogen gradients, directs organogenesis, how mechanical forces within and between cells modulate organogenesis, and how these biochemical and biomechanical processes are integrated. The first aim proposes studies to define molecular mechanisms that control the accumulation and polarity of the key Fat signaling component Dachs. The second aim will focus on defining mechanisms by which Dachs and other factors influence planar cell polarity, including both tension-dependent and tension-independent processes. The third aim investigates molecular mechanisms that regulate the key Hippo pathway kinase Warts to control growth, and interrelationships among growth-regulatory processes that affect Warts.  The proposed studies will provide a deeper understanding of mechanisms that control tissue polarity, and that control growth through Hippo signaling. Organ shape is crucial for normal organ function, and specific requirements for Ds-Fat signaling in humans have been revealed by its association with Van Maldergem syndrome. As inappropriate growth during development results in organs that are incorrectly sized or shaped, it can cause birth defects. Controlling organ growth is also important for understanding how stem cells can be used to repair or replace damaged organs, which is a goal of regenerative medicine. Additionally, the inability to limit growth in mature organisms results in cancer. Cancers in a wide variety of organs have been associated with inactivation of Hippo signaling, including liver, kidney, skin, brain, intestine, lung, ovary, breast, and prostate Understanding the regulation of Hippo signaling is thus relevant to a range of human health issues, including birth defects, cancer, and regenerative medicine."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): New technologies and approaches, such as data collection with smartphones and censors, are producing data sets that are rich with information that could be used to create a new generation of interventions for drug abuse and HIV prevention and services. However, statistical analysis methods, the keys investigators use to open the door to the scientific knowledge contained in behavioral data, have not kept up with the complexity of modern data sets and the sophistication of the questions posed by today's behavioral researchers. The focus of the proposed Center for Complex Data to Knowledge in Drug Abuse and HIV Behavioral Science (CD2K Center) is development and dissemination of the innovative statistical methods that are essential to unlock the knowledge contained in complex behavioral data and apply it in the fight against drug abuse and HIV. We propose a set of three exciting, thematically integrated research projects, each developing innovative methods for analysis of complex data. We also propose three cores to support and enhance the research, disseminate the innovative methods broadly, and attract and mentor newcomers to the field of behavioral drug abuse and HIV methodology. The overall Specific Aims of the CD2K Center are (A) To develop innovative methods for analysis of complex data that will be tailor-made to inform sophisticated, powerful, and efficient behavioral interventions for drug abuse and HIV prevention; increase knowledge about the etiology of behaviors related to drug abuse and HIV; and guide more effective delivery of drug abuse and HIV intervention services. The methods developed will facilitate the acquisition of highest quality empirical evidence based on complex data. (B) To apply the innovative methods developed in Aim A in existing drug use and HIV data sets, for the purpose of advancing behavioral science in the areas of prevention of drug abuse and HIV, drug abuse and HIV etiology, and delivery of drug abuse and HIV intervention services. We will work with a vibrant network of drug abuse and HIV scientists on empirical studies using the data they have collected and publish the results in peer-reviewed outlets. (C) To serve as a national resource by placing the innovative methods developed in the CD2K Center in the hands of drug abuse and HIV scientists worldwide.

"9365438","PROJECT SUMMARY COPD is now the 3rd leading cause of death worldwide. Emphysema, characterized by airspace enlargement and impaired gas exchange, is a major subtype of COPD. The cumulative effects of cigarette smoke exposure (CS) and environmental toxins across the lifespan are important contributing factors to the development of emphysema. Yet very little is known about the underlying mechanisms, which limits therapies. Our overall goals are to understand the molecular mechanisms of how our lungs maintain normal structural integrity and how they protect against inhaled toxins, such as CS. We identified a critical role for an innate immune receptor, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), in lung maintenance and in preventing inappropriate activation of aging and injury pathways. Unfortunately, age and CS, two of the most common risk factors for COPD, result in inadequate levels of TLR4, thus predisposing to emphysema. Our studies will fill current gaps in our understanding of how the immune system, in specific lung cells, can impact lung-protective responses even in the absence of infection, thereby offering potential new therapeutic targets. Using TLR4-deficiency and CS as clinically relevant experimental models of emphysema, we identified mechanistic roles for the senescence molecule, p16INK4A, and DNA-modifying enzymes, HDAC2, Dnmt3a and Tet2, in emphysema. In addition, we offer the first in vivo evidence that increased p16INK4A contributes to emphysema. Our overall hypothesis is that structural cell TLR4 is required to maintain normal lung integrity, at baseline and after CS, by inhibiting p16INK4A via HDAC2-Dnmt3a-Tet2-mediated mechanisms. We will use a combination of age- and CS- exposed human and mouse lungs/cells as well as innovative gene manipulations to test this hypothesis in the following Aims: 1) Identify mechanisms of decreased TLR4 expression with aging and CS and the contribution of TLR4 in specific structural cells to emphysema. 2) Determine the mechanisms of decreased HDAC2 in TLR4-deficient and CS-exposed cells. 3) Identify HDAC2 and Dnmt3a / Tet2 -mediated mechanisms of p16INK4A induction and the contribution of p16INK4A in specific structural cells to emphysema. Our studies will expand our basic understanding of the molecular drivers of emphysema, establish previously unrecognized interactions amongst innate immunity, senescence and DNA modifications and inform future preventative or therapeutic approaches to a range of age- and CS-related lung diseases."
"9297673","PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal aims to develop DNA cytosine deaminase enzymes as a non-destructive alternative to bisulfite for base-resolution mapping of cytosine modifications. Tailoring of the genome permits adaptation and specialization of various cell lineages derived from the same coding sequence. These epigenetic changes include modification of cytosine bases at the 5-postion of the nucleobase. The most common modification is 5- methylcytosine (mC), followed closely by 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (hmC), a product of TET enzyme-mediated oxidation of mC. Transformations involved in development, differentiation, pluripotency and even oncogenesis involve changes in the genomic patterns of mC and hmC, making it important to have robust methods to localize these modifications. The core methods most commonly used to detect these modifications involve treatment of genomic DNA with bisulfite, as the different cytosine modification states have a different propensity for bisulfite-induced deamination which can be analyzed by sequencing. Chemical deamination, however, takes place under extreme temperature and pH conditions that can degrade the vast majority of starting DNA. Therefore, the landscapes of cytosine modifications in many small or transient cell populations, like those of primordial germ cells or oocytes, have only been characterized to a limited extent. In this proposal, we will develop APOBEC-Coupled Epigenetic Sequencing (ACE-Seq), an enzymatic and non- destructive alternative for base-resolution localization of genomic hmC. This method relies on APOBEC3A (A3A), a cytosine deaminase enzyme from the AID/APOBEC family that canonically functions in innate immunity. In our preliminary work, we have demonstrated that A3A can efficiently discriminate between different cytosine modification states, offering a means for localizing modifications under mild, bisulfite-free conditions. We propose to manipulate A3A and other enzymatic components of ACE-Seq to increase its efficiency and broaden the window for discrimination between cytosine modification states. After protocol optimization, we will apply ACE-Seq in parallel with established methods to profile the hmC landscape of embryonic stem cells. Our effort will highlight the ability for ACE-Seq to function on trace quantities of DNA and to localize modifications obscured by current methodologies, offering the field a novel approach to access the epigenome of previously inaccessible genomes."
"9336151","Project Summary Rates of Obesity and Type II Diabetes (T2D) remain high in the United States. The consequences of these rates can be measured in dollars, including treatment costs and lost productivity, and in lower indicators of quality of life. Despite the general knowledge that decreased calorie intake and increased calorie expenditure can lead to weight loss and better glucose tolerance, Americans have not made a significant dent in the rates of these diseases through sustained dieting and exercise. Clearly, new treatments are needed to help combat these diseases. One new approach that has received a lot of attention is to increase a type of fat called brown fat, also known as thermogenic adipose tissue. In mammals there are two types of adipose tissue: brown fat and white fat. Brown fat oxidizes fatty acids as heat energy. White fat stores lipids for future use. Previously, our lab has shown that the JAK/STAT pathway is required for proper differentiation of brown adipose tissue in- vitro, specifically Tyk2-STAT3 signaling. This proposed study focuses on the STAT3 aspect of brown fat differentiation. There is almost nothing known about the targets STAT3 regulates during differentiation of brown fat, however, in the preliminary data we show that inhibiting STAT3 significantly reduces expression of brown fat-selective genes while moderately affecting expression of genes common to brown- and white- fat. The in-vivo consequences from loss of STAT3 in brown fat are unknown, and no role of STAT3 in the development of human thermogenic fat has been reported. We hypothesize that STAT3 plays a major role in the terminal differentiation of brown fat by directly regulating brown fat-selective genes. The aims of this study are to determine: 1) The gene targets regulated by STAT3 by performing ChIPseq on murine brown preadipocytes in-vitro, 2) the disturbances to whole animal metabolism due to loss of STAT3 in thermogenic fat, and 3) the role of STAT3 in the differentiation of human thermogenic fat, specifically if STAT3 regulates similar genes that we will identify in rodent tissue. The answers to these questions will increase our understanding the differentiation mechanism of thermogenic adipose tissue, which would be the first step to realizing a therapeutic approach."
"9340261","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although  severe  asthma  afflicts  a  relatively  small  percentage  of  individuals  with  asthma,  it  affects  millions  of  individuals  in  the  United States.  Despite  the  numerous  therapies  available  for  patients  with  this  disabling  diseas,  severe  asthma  remains  difficult  to  control  in  many  patients  due  in  part  to  pathobiologc  and  clinical  heterogeneity. YKL-40 is a chitinase-like protein that is encoded by the Chitinase-3-Like-1 (CHI3L1) gene in humans.  Our  laboratories  discovered  that  YKL-40  is  elevated  in  the  circulation  and  lung  of  a  subgroup  of  severe asthmatics.  In addition, we determined that the levels in the blood correlate with YKL-40 expression in the airway, reduced lung function, and pathologic airway remodeling.  These  studies  suggested  that  YKL-40  levels  could  serve  as  a  biomarker  for  selecting  a  subset  of  patients  with  asthma  and  be  useful  for  asthma  management. We also conducted a genome wide association study of serum YKL-40 levels and discovered  that  variation  in  the  CHI3L1  gene,  including  a  single  nucleotide  polymorphism  in  the  gene's  core  promoter  region,  influences  serum  YKL-40  levels,  asthma  prevalence,  and  lung  function.  Our  group  and  others  then  discovered  that YKL-40  functions  as  a  critical  mediator  of  inflammation  and  remodeling  by  controlling  apoptosis, modulating innate and adaptive immune responses, and mediating repair responses in the lung via  binding to IL-13 receptor ?2 (IL-13R?2). This leads to activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),  protein  kinase  B/AKT,  and  Wnt/ß-catenin-signaling  a  cascade  of  events  that  regulates  oxidant  injury,  apoptosis,  pyroptosis,  inflammasome  activation,  antibacterial  responses,  melanoma  metastasis,  and  TGF-ß production in vivo.  Furthermore, multiple studies have shown that inhibition of YKL-40 in knockout mice or  using  antibodies  against  YKL-40  inhibits  inflammation  in  animal  models  of  asthma  and  downstream  of  transgenic expression of IL-13. These studies demonstrate that a therapeutic against YKL-40 has the potential to be an effective therapy for severe asthma.  In  this  proposal,  our  multidisciplinary  team  in  translational  research,  genomics,  drug  development,  and  immunology  will  complete  the  pre-clinical  development  of  humanized  monoclonal  antibodies  against  YKL-40.  In  Aim  1,  the  UH2  Phase,  we  will  develop  a  humanized  clinical  lead  candidate  monoclonal  antibody  against  YKL-40  that  inhibits  allergic  airway  inflammation  with  a  favorable safety and, pharmacokinetic profiles. In the Aim 2/UH3 Phase, with a commercial partner Covance, we will conduct ADME studies. In Aim 3, we will develop a companion diagnostic test using intermediate anti- YKL-40  monoclonal  antibodies  clones  for  the  measurement  of  free  and  drug-bound  YKL-40  for  patient  selection and therapeutic monitoring.  We will prepare to submit an Investigational New Drug (IND) application  for  a  humanized  anti-YKL-40  antibody  for  the  treatment  of  severe  asthma.  Ultimately,  targeted  blockade  of  YKL-40  will  be  a  critical  addition  to  the  astma  physician's  armamentarium  to  treat  patients  with  this  chronic  severe disease and could prove useful in other disease where inflammation is modulated by YKL-40."

Through the ongoing participation of the PCCs, ASSESS-AKI-Phase 2 will become an unparalleled resource that will expand the science related to AKI natural history as well as the impact of AKI on the development and progression of CKD, cardiovascular disease, survival, quality of life, functional status and other important outcomes."
"9336888","Abstract ? Clinical and Translational Core (Core E) Despite recent significant and important advances in characterizing pathways of disease progression in ADPKD, the management and treatment of the disease remains largely supportive, without proven disease- modifying interventions. Additional clinical and translational investigations are clearly needed to identify promising new therapies. Significant challenges to such investigations include limited resources, limited access to sufficient numbers of well-characterized patients with ADPKD, incomplete characterization of human kidney tissue from ADPKD patients, lack of sensitive instruments for quantifying patient symptoms, and insufficient expertise in clinical study design. The Baltimore PKD Center Clinical and Translational Core has established a strong foundation of key resources for these investigations and begun to disseminate these resources to active investigators. In our next phase, we propose to promote and expand these resources through: 1) the longitudinal collection of repeated biorepository specimens and clinical measures among 250  participants with ADPKD, including total kidney and liver volume, renal function, and occurrence of acute  ADPKD complications. 2) the creation of a novel human tissue bank of ADPKD kidneys among 40 patients receiving simultaneous  nephrectomy and renal transplantation and control donor nephrectomy tissue. 3) the development of a web-based disease registry for recruitment into clinical trials and cohort studies. 4) the development and testing of a novel mobile health-informatics tool to prospectively collect patient-  reported outcomes in a ?real-world? setting. 5) Development of a structured consultation service for ADPKD investigators on the design of clinical and  observational trials and methods of human subjects protection. These resources will be disseminated among a robust user base of accomplished internal and external clinical and translational investigators. With these Aims, the support of the University of Maryland Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) and in close collaboration with the Administrative Core and the other Scientific Cores, the Clinical and Translational Core will provide the resources and expertise to greatly enhance clinical and translational research in ADPKD throughout the Mid-Atlantic region and nationally."
"9362529","ABSTRACT Routine influenza exposure and vaccination generate inadequate cross-protective immunity against novel avian influenza. This fuels concerns for pandemics that may cause high numbers of severe illness and deaths in immune naïve populations. Avian H7N9 influenza poses a threat to human health because of its high case fatality rate consistently observed in annual epidemic waves since it emergence in 2013. The potential for virus adaptations that increase human-to-human transmissibility raises concern for an H7N9 influenza virus pandemic. H7N9 influenza HA elicits weak neutralizing antibody responses in natural infection and vaccination. To prepare for an H7N9 influenza pandemic, vaccine strategies that overcome the poor immunogenicity of H7N9 HA are needed. We hypothesize that a stronger CD4+ T cell response to H7N9 HA will support an improved hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody response. To address this hypothesis, we propose to introduce seasonal HA-specific CD4+ T cell epitopes into H7N9 HA, using a structure-guided approach, to produce a novel immunogen capable of priming protective HI responses by inducing CD4+ T cell memory. The proposed studies are grounded in our prior work showing that the H3-HA306-318 CD4+ T cell epitope introduced into the corresponding site in H7N9 HA boosts effector T cell and antibody immune responses while preserving neutralizing antibody epitopes that would be encountered in natural infection. Here, we propose to introduce more memory CD4+ T cell epitopes into the existing optimized H7-HA because the frequency of CD4+ T cells that recognize the H3-HA306-318 epitope varies among individuals depending on their history of seasonal influenza exposure. Aim 1 will evaluate novel HAs composed of different numbers of engineered CD4+ T cell epitopes. A new HA containing the fewest engineered seasonal HA CD4+ T cell epitopes that best approximates the biophysical properties of wild type H7N9 HA and demonstrates enhanced mouse and human immune responses over wild type H7N9 HA will be selected to go forward to Aim 2 refinement studies. In Aim 2, we will reduce the mutational load of the immunogen that emerges from Aim 1 to generate an improved design that maintains the gain in protective immunity while more closely preserving structural and biophysical properties of wild type H7- HA. The benefits of a lower mutational load will be minimized perturbation to neutralizing antibody targets and improved manufacturability. The proposed studies will identify a lead candidate with minimum mutational load and maximal immunogenicity and protective efficacy that is ready for IND enabling studies by the end of this Partnerships program."

"9391486","Analytical methods for liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) of glycans and glycopepeptides are mature and available to biomedical scientists with access to mass spectrometry instruments. The primary barrier to the adoption of such methods by non-glycoscientists is the lack of tools for processing the raw LC- MS data, evaluating the results, and results visualizations that present those findings in a systematic fashion. Academic research groups have defined algorithmic approaches for interpretation mass spectra in the glycoscience domain. Despite this effort, there remains a paucity of practical, user accessible tools for processing glycan and glycopeptide mass spectral data. The first problem is that public domain and commercial proteomics workflows make peptide-specific assumptions that exclude released glycans and glycosylated peptides. The second is that available glycoscience mass spectral analysis tools, do not address the full scope of data processing needed for high throughput LC-MS data sets. Thus, users with access to mass spectrometry through local proteomics core facilities do not have access to adequate software tools for processing the liquid-chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) datasets. The result is a serious bottleneck for dissemination and use of glycoscience LC-MS methods in biomedicine. We have developed three software programs for glycoscience mass spectrometry that we now propose to engineer and disseminate as accessible solutions for biomedical scientists. GlycReSoft processes glycan profiling and integrated omics of glycoproteins. GAGfinder is a second generation algorithm for sequencing glycosaminoglycans from electron activated dissociation (ExD) tandem mass spectra. GlycoDeNovo determines branched glycan topologies and linkage configurations from ExD tandem mass spectra. We propose to engineer and disseminate open source pipelines for processing glycan and glycopeptide LC-MS data. This will include all modules necessary to process vendor-independent mass spectrometry data, perform LC-MS profiling, tandem mass spectrometry assignments and generate publication quality graphical outputs. We will deliver software that builds on available data standards and MS processing libraries. The software will use modern glycan representation standards and communicate with the international glycan structure repository and namespace (GlyTouCan). Users will have the option of running the software as a desktop application, through a server, or as a GRITS Toolbox plugin. The software tools will be available open source through a Github repository. In Aim 1, we will develop our GlycReSoft program and related tools into a complete solution for glycomics and glycoproteomics LC-MS data analysis. In Aim 2, we will develop GAGfinder software into a complete solution for sequencing glycosaminoglycans from ExD tandem mass spectra. In Aim 3, we will develop a pipeline based on our GlycoDeNovo software for sequencing N- and O- glycans."
"9319726","The goals of this program are to characterize lower urinary tract (LUT) dysfunction due to spinal cord injury and to test new therapies. Effects of spinal cord injury are multifaceted involving changes in the spinal cord, peripheral neurons and different cell types in the bladder and urethra leading to detrusorsphincter- dyssynergia, urothelial cell hyperplasia, interstitial cell pacemaker activity, afferent nerve sensitization and smooth muscle cell hypertrophy. Therapies to be tested include botulinum neurotoxin serotype A, |33-adrenergic receptor agonists, PDE-5 inhibitrors, and nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor antibodies. Optical mapping techniques we developed are extremely effective in studying LUT and are a key link between projects. These approaches utilize unique mouse and rat preparations including spinal cord slices, bladder-urethra sheets, sheets with spinal nerves, wall cross-sections and 'inline' primary urothelial, neuronal, interstitial and smooth muscle cells. GCaMP4 encoded viral vectors will be used to label sensory nerves innervating the bladder and sensory nerves and motoneurons in the spinal cord controlling the bladder and urethral sphincter. The program Pis and core Directors have extensive expertise in urologic research and optical mapping. Anthony Kanai, project 1 and imaging core co-director, is an expert in afferent nerve, urothelial and interstitial cell interactions and was first to use optical mapping to study the LUT. Lori Birder, project 2, is an expert in urothelial cell pathophysiology and was first to demonstrate their neuronal-like properties. Naoki Yoshimura, project 3, is an expert in the pathophysiology of sensory neurons and was first to demonstrate changes in ion channel expression in DRG neurons as a mechanism for bladder afferent sensitization. William de Groat, project 4 and animal core director, is an expert on the autonomic pathophysiology of the LUT and was first to show the role of C-fiber afferents in bladder overactivity. Guy Salama, imaging core co-director, is an expert in optical mapping and was first to develop methods to simultaneously record action potentials and Ca2+ transients.

The proposal builds oh nine years of ? ICOBRE-funded research that have supported the development of new concepts and innovative model systems! 'for studying the underlying mechanisms of Jung disease and chronic airway infection, bringing us closer to our goal of developing new therapeutics for these diseases. Lung disease is the third most frequent cause of death in the United States, claiming ~360,000 Americans annually. Tragically, millions more live with chronic lung diseases including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cystic fibrosis (CF), and the number of patients is increasing at an alarming rate. Thus, a better understanding of the etiology of lung disease is required, as are new therapeutic approaches. With support from COBRE I and II (2003-present), our Center has grown dramatically, from 6 investigators in 2002 to 32 tenure-track investigators in 2012. Of our 32 faculty, 12 are physician-scientists recruited to the Center with COBRE support. Our faculty have developed novel in vitro models to study host-pathogen interactions in CF; initiated an ambitious program to characterize ; ;the CF respiratory microbiome and mycobiome and thus develop more effective therapies for chronic, .polymicrobial lung infections; and established an ambitious CF drug-discovery program. During the period of ;COBRE l/ll support, our group has published 1,007 papers, garnering editorial and Faculty of 1000 recognition. [Our faculty have also obtained $151M in extramural research support and received national awards.

"9407685","Project Summary Lead can enter drinking water when service pipes that contain lead corrode, especially where the water has high acidity or low mineral content. Lead is a toxic heavy metal that can be harmful to human health even at low exposure levels, and it can bioaccumulate in the body over time. Young children, infants, and fetuses are particularly vulnerable, and even low levels of exposure have been linked to damage to the central and peripheral nervous system, learning disabilities, shorter stature, impaired hearing, and impaired formation and function of blood cells. Current methods for lead measurement in drinking water require someone to send a water sample to a laboratory, where bulky instruments are used to evaluate lead concentrations, and the results get back in a few days. While some colorimetric test strips are available on the market that can be used to measure lead in homes, they lack the accuracy needed, and the cost of each test strip is >$10, too expensive for people who want to determine lead levels in their tap water frequently. Intelligent Optical Systems, Inc. (IOS) proposes to develop a low-cost, simple, and reliable home-use test kit for measuring lead in tap water to better protect families from lead poisoning. The proposed test kit is based on a highly innovative method of combining aptamers with nanomaterials, making the kit highly selective and sensitive for lead testing. The test kit will be easy to use; simply add tap water to the test kit vial and the water will change color according to the concentration of lead in the water. Each test kit will cost<$2. With the proposed test kit, householders can check their tap water quality regularly and avoid lead poisoning."
"9526126","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad goal of this proposal is to develop and apply a novel sensing platform to detect and molecularly profile exosomes for monitoring tumor progression and treatment response in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Exosomes are membrane-bound phospholipid nanovesicles actively shed by cancer cells and the platform will be used to determine the abundance and composition of exosomes in serum. The candidate, Hyungsoon Im, has extensive experience in developing new sensing platforms with a background in engineering and now aims to transition to biomedical cancer research. Through the training, he will further develop skill sets to conduct independent translational research and make significant contribution to the field of cancer exosome research. This work will be conducted in the Center for Systems Biology at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School under the mentorship of Dr. Ralph Weissleder MD, PhD. To expand expertise, he has also brought in Xandra Breakefield, an internationally recognized expert in exosome biology and Prof. Antonio Chiocca, a neurosurgical oncologist with interest in translational work for additional mentoring and expertise. These members of the advisory committee will facilitate the transition of Hyungsoon's work toward a unique and independent line of investigation and allow him to develop a successful career as an independent biomedical cancer researcher. The research plan aims to first develop a microarray nano-plasmonic exosome sensing platform (nPLEX) for multiplexed profiling of exosome proteins and nucleic acids in serum. Exosomes have unique advantages as a circulating biomarker, but the quantification of their molecular composition has been challenging especially in clinical settings. This work stems from preliminary research using plasmonic nanoholes for sensitive detection of exosomes in a label-free manner and quantification of their marker expression levels. In specific aim 1, an advanced nPLEX platform with 400 sensing arrays will be developed by integrating with state-of-the- art nanofabrication techniques and a high-throughput readout system. In specific aim 2, the nPLEX platform will be applied for serial analyses of exosomes in GBM mouse models. Longitudinal assessment of exosomes pre- and post-treatment will be used to identify specific exosomes markers that correlate with tumor progression and treatment response to predict therapeutic efficacy. The proposed platform would allow comprehensive analyses of tumor-derived exosomes to shed light on molecular profiles of primary and metastatic tumors and provide information to guide efficient treatment schemes. The new nPLEX system could be a transformative tool facilitating cancer research and clinical practice."
"9302229","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neuroimaging and postmortem histopathological studies report that up to one-third of AD patients have some degree of vascular pathology. Midlife vascular risk factors, particularly hypertension, have been associated with an increased risk of AD in later life. Similarly, reductions in BP are associated with protection against AD. Ths indicates that long-standing uncontrolled BP and other vascular factors may contribute to AD pathology, possibly through decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) and accumulation of ?-amyloid (A?) a key pathological feature of preclinical AD. While studies show that vascular risk factors contribute to AD risk and progression, there are currently no effective interventions to prevent or slow AD progression that target these modifiable vascular factors. Although vascular risk factors have been linked to AD, the mechanism has yet to be clarified and it is unknown to what extent these measures interact with ApoE and familial history.  Two mechanisms by which vascular risk factors may contribute to AD are reduced CBF and A? neuropathology. To better understand the mechanisms by which increased vascular risk and subsequent arterial dysfunction may modify CBF, A? levels and cognition, we propose a longitudinal study enrolling 80 asymptomatic, middle-aged (45-65 yrs) adults at risk for AD, due to a parental history of AD. We will make use of the University of Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center's (ADRC) NIH-funded cohort, comprised of middle-aged participants 'at risk' for AD based on family history and created to facilitate AD prevention studies. This cohort is at high risk for AD and would likely benefit the most from an early intervention.  CBF will be quantitatively ascertained via a state-of-the art neuroimaging modality developed at the UW Madison, called 3D phase contrast, vastly undersampled, isotropic voxel radial projection imaging (PC VIPR). This novel technique provides a thorough evaluation of cerebral arterial function, including flow volume, velocity, pressure gradient and shear wall stress, measures closely related to the peripheral arterial indices that we will collect in the proposed project (i.e. pulse-wave velocity and flow mediated vasodilation). CBF will be assessed in the middle and posterior cerebral arteries, bilaterally. These arteries are responsible for blood flow to the hippocampus and frontal lobes, regions impaired in AD. A? levels will be collected in CSF and cognitive tasks of particular interest will include executive function and working memory domains.  The objective of the proposed study is to determine the extent to which arterial function, as ascertained by cardiac index, flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD), pulse wave velocity (PWV) and nocturnal blood pressure patterns predict: 1) cerebral blood flow (CBF) in medium and large cerebral arteries and cerebral perfusion via ASL, 2) A? levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and 3) cognition over 2 years, in participants at-risk for AD based on family history. Outcomes will then be combined to test our model described in the application and determine the primary mechanism by which arterial function may influence cognition (i.e. CBF) over time."

"9481524","Project Summary Over 350,000 open surgical procedures to treat cardiovascular disease are performed each year in the USA, with many more being performed worldwide. A great number of these eventually fail due to intimal hyperplasia (IH), which is primarily caused by smooth muscle cell (SMC) transformation from a quiescent to a pathogenic (proliferative, migratory, and inflammatory) phenotype. Current clinical methods for preventing IH (e.g., drug-eluting stents) are not applicable for traditional open surgical procedures such as bypass, endarterectomy, or dialysis access. Thus, there is a notable lack of clinical options for delivery of drugs that block IH following open cardiovascular surgery. We have developed a novel unimolecular nanoparticle (NP) which provides a unique opportunity to meet this medical need through its multiple favorable properties, which include excellent stability, the ability to provide sustained drug release, and the chemical versatility for conjugation with ligands or molecules that target periadventitial collagen (for the creation of a perivascular reservoir) or pathogenic SMCs (for more precise control of IH). Our preliminary studies demonstrate that NPs are capable of prolonging the release of the clinically used drug rapamycin, resulting in a more durable inhibition of IH in an animal model of IH. The goal of this project is to develop a novel NP- mediated multifunctional drug delivery platform that: (1) is readily applicable to the outer surface of blood vessels at the time of open surgery, (2) produces sustained drug release for periods of up to 3 months and beyond, and (3) specifically targets pathogenic SMCs thereby focusing toxicity to these cells while sparing quiescent cells. To achieve sustained drug release, we will generate a ?perivascular NP reservoir? of rapamycin either by sequestering NPs around the blood vessel using a hydrogel or by ?painting? NPs onto the outer surface of the vessel. In the latter case, the NPs are conjugated with a small molecule or peptide that facilitates their attachment to the adventitia. To test the efficacy of targeted drug delivery, we will conjugate NPs with ligands that bind to receptors that are highly expressed on the surface of pathogenic SMCs. Thus, in Specific Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that the perivascular application of a rapamycin/NP reservoir maintained in a 1-month durable hydrogel produces sustained inhibition of IH. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that a rapamycin/NP reservoir ?painted? onto the outer surface of the vessel produces sustained inhibition of IH. And in Specific Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that rapamycin/NPs capable of targeting pathogenic SMCs are more efficacious in mitigating IH than non-targeted NPs. Our long-term goal is to create a perivascular nanoplatform that can be readily applied at the time of open vascular reconstruction and is effective in preventing recurrent vascular disease via durable and targeted drug delivery. We believe that the success of these studies will be facilitated by a collaborative team including a vascular surgeon scientist, a biomedical engineer and a biochemist, and will benefit hundreds of thousands of patients."
"9371095","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT:  Despite all the advances in lung transplantation, we still have no effective non-invasive methods for assessing the immune function of lung transplant recipients. The standard method for assessing the immune function of lung transplant recipients remains the surveillance bronchoscopy with trans-bronchial biopsy, a procedure that carries a small but real risk of morbidity. Current immune-suppression practices are protocol based, where recipients receive the same immunosuppression, mostly based on their time from transplant. This approach however, does not take into account the considerable variability in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and underling immune strength which is observed between patients. This protocol based approach leads to unnecessary morbidity and mortality due to both over-immunosuppression (infection, malignancy, toxicity) and under-immunosuppression (acute rejection). Importantly, each episode of infection and acute rejection increases the risk of Chronic Lung Allograft Dysfunction (CLAD), the major factor limiting survival after lung transplantation.  The objective of this prospective study is to determine if plasma CXCR3 chemokines (CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11) can be used to non-invasively diagnose episodes of acute rejection and identify recipients at increased risk of developing CLAD. The successful completion of these aims would improve our current management of lung transplant recipients by minimizing the need for surveillance transbronchial biopsies, allowing for early non-invasive diagnosis of acute rejection and tailoring of immune suppression regimens to serial measurements of actual immune function. This proposal is the ideal springboard into my independent career and R01 application conducting a clinical trial tailoring an individual?s immunosuppression regimen to serial biomarker(s) measurements as a method to minimize the incidence of acute rejection, pneumonia and CLAD.  My prior work experience, Master of Science in Clinical Research and clinical training in lung transplantation make me uniquely suited for the current proposal. However, I require additional training in three critical areas to successfully complete the current aims and transition to independent investigation: molecular/cellular biology techniques, advanced statistical methods and clinical trial design. During this award period, I will acquire new skills which will improve my ability to assess the bioactivity of chemokine pathways and immune function after lung transplantation, statistically model complex data, optimize diagnostic performance of biomarkers, conduct biomarker validation studies as well as clinical trials implementing their use. My career development plan takes full advantage of the resources available at UCLA, including coursework, Center of Immunogenetics, Departments of Pathology and Biomathematics, scientific and career development seminars, as well as the internationally recognized expertise of my mentors and collaborators."
"9410091","Project Summary This fellowship training program proposes rigorous didactics, innovative research, and strong inter-disciplinary collaborations aiding both. It will prepare me for productivity in translational HIV research, as my goal is an academic career as a physician-scientist advancing elimination of non-AIDS complications of ART-treated HIV infection. The research proposal builds on my sponsor's recent work on T cell metabolic reprogramming and HIV replication, extending it to monocyte-related immunopathogenesis of cardiovascular disease in HIV infected patients. My preliminary data indicate that a catalytic mTOR inhibitor (mTORi), as well as a statin, diminish ex vivo activation of downstream effectors of mTOR in monocytes from uninfected persons, and suppress emergence of inflammatory monocyte phenotypes after TLR engagement. A more complete characterization of the mTOR signaling pathway and its downstream functions in monocytes is proposed to rigorously delineate its contribution to ongoing inflammation in ART-treated HIV-1 infection. Aim 1 will determine whether mTOR activity is necessary and sufficient for monocytes to develop an inflammatory phenotype after exposure ex vivo to LPS (a TLR4 ligand) and RNA (a defined TLR7/8 ligand). I will also determine whether the inflammatory phenotype of monocytes isolated from HIV-infected donors can be reversed by ex vivo exposure to mTORi. I also propose to extend my additional preliminary results supporting the hypothesis that inhibition of mTORC1-dependent cellular functions contributes to the anti-inflammatory effects of statins. Aim 2 will evaluate the effect of ex vivo statin (rosuvastatin) treatment on mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity in unstimulated and TLR-stimulated monocytes from uninfected subjects, as well as whether rosuvastatin blocks a shift to inflammatory CD16+ monocyte phenotypes. I will rigorously study causality using genetic approaches to impact mTORC1, and also determine whether starting in vivo statin treatment in HIV patients with recent coronary events is associated with decreasing mTOR activity in their monocytes."
"9407512","Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common types of bacterial infection encountered by humans throughout their lifespan and are a major health problem afflicting millions of people each year. Gram-negative bacteria cause the majority of infections of which Escherichia coli is the primary pathogen and prone to antibiotic resistance. The standard methods for species diagnosis and susceptibility determination are culture- based protocols that take up to 48 h. As a result, UTIs are one of the most frequent reasons for antimicrobial prescriptions in healthcare facilities, without the benefit of a confirmed diagnosis. Therefore, modern day rapid diagnostic methods that promote rapid identification and antimicrobial stewardship are crucial.  The long-term objective of this R&D is to develop an easy to use platform for the rapid (?3 h) identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (ID/AST) of UTI pathogens directly from urine. A major goal is to develop a diagnostic that can bypass the need for bacterial amplification and isolation and thus overcome the major time-limiting step of current diagnostics. The platform will consist of species-specific bacteriophages (phages) engineered to express heterologous marker proteins, a lateral flow immunoassay, and analysis by Sofia, a fluorescent assay reader produced and marketed by our Quidel collaborators. Upon bacterial cell infection, the recombinant phages will produce large amounts of a foreign marker protein, which following phage-mediated cell lysis, can be rapidly and sensitively detected by an immunoassay and objectively read by Sofia. As the marker protein production is correlated to cell fitness, the platform termed Phage-accelerated Test (PhACT), can rapidly determine an isolates sensitivity, or resistance to a particular antibiotic, a key attribute in this 'post-antibiotic' era. The Phase I proof-of-principle studies will focus on demonstrating feasibility for E. coli as this species is responsible for >70% of uncomplicated UTIs. Specific Aim 1 will generate a cocktail of genetically engineered E. coli phages harboring the foreign marker protein. Specific Aim 2 will develop phage-mediated lateral-flow immunoassay and determine its performance characteristics for direct ID/AST from urine samples. The research is significant as the technology enables simultaneous detection and phenotypic drug susceptibility analysis without culture amplification and isolation, thus bypassing the major time limiting step in diagnostics. This is key as decreasing length of time for diagnosis and the administration of appropriate therapy positively impacts patient outcomes and promotes antimicrobial stewardship."

"9386145","PROJECT SUMMARY Rationale: Cardiovascular (CV) disease is the leading cause of death for women and men in the US, accounting for one in every four deaths. In 2014, CV deaths among African-Americans were 30% higher than among non-Hispanic whites, and while CV mortality rates decreased for both blacks and whites over the past four decades, racial/ethnic disparities increased substantially. Despite considerable progress on the identification of behavioral, environmental, social, and economic mechanisms underlying racial/ethnic disparities in CV outcomes, little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which these socially-patterned risk factors become physically embodied. Although it has been proposed that epigenetic factors, such as DNA methylation (DNAm), may contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in CV outcomes, this hypothesis has yet to be empirically tested. Methods: The proposed study will examine DNAm patterns among African-American and non-Hispanic white participants in the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 1999-2002), a nationally representative population-based sample with detailed measures on potential underlying mechanisms of racial/ethnic differences in DNAm, including health behaviors, environmental toxicant exposures, and individual- and neighborhood-level social and economic factors, as well as genetic data to account for population stratification. We will perform genome-wide DNAm assays on >850,000 CpG sites using biobanked DNA from 535 African-American and 1,952 white individuals aged 50+ from NHANES 1999-2002. DNAm data will be linked to existing survey data, laboratory data, and 15-year mortality follow-up data to accomplish the following aims: (1) To quantify racial/ethnic differences in DNAm patterns, overall and by age, (2) To determine whether these differences are explained by factors already known to contribute to health disparities, such as sedentary behavior, lead exposure, food insecurity, poverty, and residential segregation, and (3) To determine whether racial/ethnic disparities in CV mortality are explained by differences in DNAm patterns. Relevance: By adding DNAm data from a diverse, nationally representative sample to the growing number of studies with methylomic data, the proposed study will help ensure the equitable translation of epigenomic discoveries into health applications, such as precision medicine initiatives, that will benefit the health of everyone in the US, including racial/ethnic minorities, the poor, and those who live outside large urban centers, all of whom tend to be underrepresented in genetic research. Moreover, DNAm data from this study will be made available to the public through the CDC Research Data Center, enabling others in the research community to explore additional critical hypotheses about the role of DNAm in producing racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and rural disparities in a variety of health-related outcomes."
"9389794","Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), a devastating asbestos-induced cancer, has <10% 5-yr survival. Treatments are few and limited. Aggressive surgery (extra-pleural pneumonectomy (EPP) or pleurectomy/decortication (PD)) followed by chemotherapy is effective in a subset of patients, yielding 20%-30% 5-yr survival, but identifying the patients who will benefit from this treatment is a significant challenge. Surgery of any type for MPM is associated with considerable morbidity and some mortality. The primary goal is to enhance and validate prognostic biomarkers and a robust risk score to identify only those patients who will be long-term survivors to undergo surgery. We previously developed and prospectively validated a 4-factor pathology staging score (MPS=MPM Prognostic Score) that is the best reliable prognostic test after surgery for MPM. We extended this effort to develop a pre-treatment clinical prognostic score to inform patients in their decisions regarding therapy. Herein we propose for multicenter clinical evaluation this risk score (MRiS = MPM Risk Score) based on 4 simple tests (Chest CT, CBC, 2 molecular tests on pleural biopsy). We will leverage 4 unique prospective patient cohorts (total: 1101 patients) with clinical data and specimens for the proposed work. These cohorts constitute a one-of-a-kind resource that also allows to generate, evaluate and validate new candidate biomarkers. In a recent study published in Nat. Genetics, we defined 4 robust, distinct and more homogeneous expression clusters consistent with the epithelial to mesenchymal transformation and demonstrated that expression cluster I (defined by CLDN15/VIM ratio) can be a surrogate for the histological- subtype-diagnosis in MRiS and we propose to expand this to the other clusters. We also constructed and validated a derivative of a simple existing blood test (neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio) that is prognostic and a part of MRiS representing the immune response. We hypothesize that 1) adding new genetic and clinical test information to our current prognostic models will enable more accurate allocation of MPM patients into more homogeneous pre-treatment subpopulations, allowing for rational assignment of therapies; 2) our new prognostic models can be successfully transferred to FFPE and be used clinically. The Aims are: 1. Prospectively validate a new pre-treatment prognostic algorithm to predict survival for MPM patients, by enrolling all new patients with MPM into a clinical trial where the MRiS is determined prior to treatment and outcome is measured by follow up. We will also: a. Determine test and specimens properties for the molecular tests in pleural biopsies; and b. Develop, explore and test new diagnostic, prognostic and predictive signatures for MPM based on expression clusters membership and response to specific therapies. 2. Transfer the molecular tests to FFPE preserved pleural biopsy samples and determine concordance, specimen and test properties of proposed molecular tests (MPT and expression cluster membership) using RT-PCR. 3. Prospectively validate MRiS as well as MPT and MPS in FFPE specimens from multi-center collections."
"9306795","Project Summary  Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States, with African Americans (AAs) suffering a higher lung cancer incidence than any other ethnic or racial group, for reasons that are poorly understood. Recent studies have shown that the lungs are inhabited by communities of diverse types of bacteria and that bacterial infection in the lungs has been associated with lung cancer risk. Recent studies have also shown that the oral microbiome is the primary source of bacterial microbiota in the lungs and that the bacterial communities of the lungs overlap those found in the mouth. We found in our pilot study that multiple bacterial taxa in mouth rinse samples were associated with lung cancer risk. We hypothesize that (1) oral microbiomes may play a role in the etiology of lung cancer, (2) oral bacteria may interact with cigarette smoking and chronic lung diseases to influence lung cancer risk, and (3) the oral microbiome of AAs may differ from that of European Americans (EAs) in ways that could lead to a high incidence of lung cancer in AAs. To test these hypotheses, we will use already collected data and stored biospecimens from the Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS) and Black Women's Health Study (BWHS). Mouth rinse samples were collected from approximately 39,000 SCCS participants and 28,000 BWHS participants using a similar collection method. In the proposed study, we will conduct a nested case-control study of lung cancer, with 800 incident cases (600 AAs and 200 EAs) and 1,000 matched controls (600 AAs and 400 EAs), using pre- diagnostic mouth rinse samples. We will perform whole metagenome shotgun sequencing and use advanced biostatistics and bioinformatics techniques to investigate oral microbial composition (bacterial species/strains abundance and diversity) and functional capabilities (bacterial genes/pathways abundance and diversity) for their associations with lung cancer risk (Aim 1). We will evaluate the possible interaction of oral microbial communities with other risk factors in relation to lung cancer risk (Aim 2). We will further evaluate whether the oral microbiome and lung cancer association differs between AAs and EAs and whether African ancestry modifies the microbiome-lung cancer association (Aim 3). Finally, we will perform in vitro studies to evaluate potential function of identified bacteria (Aim 4). The proposed study is highly innovative, as there are no published studies on the association between the oral microbiome and lung cancer risk. The exceptional resources of the SCCS and BWHS, coupled with state-of-the-art whole metagenome shotgun sequencing and bioinformatics technologies, provide an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the role of the oral microbiome in lung cancer risk. Results from our proposed study will increase understanding of the pathophysiological effects of microbiomes on the etiology of lung cancer and could provide useful information for preventive interventions as well as providing new information to ameliorate disparities in lung cancer.  "

"9374439","Parkinson's disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) produce profound motor and cognitive impairment associated with aggregation of ?-synuclein (?Syn). In these diseases, ?Syn undergoes complex post-translational modifications and fragmentation. In particular, many reports show increasing levels of C- terminally truncated (?C) ?Syn in brains of familial PD ?Syn mutation carriers and as a function of disease severity. Notably, truncated ?C-?Syn can induce soluble full-length ?Syn to co-assemble and thus accelerate, or even initiate, its aggregation. Limited research has focused on the proteases mediating ?C-?Syn truncation, their potential activation pathways, and the specific forms of the ?Syn substrate. Known caspase and calpain recognition sites occur in the ?Syn C-terminus, and inhibiting these proteases lowers ?C-?Syn and subsequent ?Syn aggregation. Moreover, the PI's recent studies of ?Syn in rodents exposed to paraquat, a herbicide linked to sporadic PD risk, showed elevated ?C-?Syn due to activation of calpain-1. However, these and other studies examining ?Syn in neurons or brain tissue have used denaturing conditions that preclude discriminating between monomers and the physiological ?Syn tetramer/multimers that our and other labs recently discovered. Using an intact-cell crosslinking assay that preserves the lysis-sensitive tetramers/multimers, we have shown that all fPD missense mutants shift normal tetramers to monomers. Further, we reported that mutating the N-terminal KTKEGV repeat motif, namely expressing E35K+E46K (?2K?) and E35K+E46K+E61K (?3K?) that mimic a doubling or tripling of the fPD E46K mutation, decreases the propensity of ?Syn to form normal tetramers/multimers. The resultant excess monomers associate with membranes, form ?Syn-rich vesicular inclusions, cause neurotoxicity, and could be subject to ?C truncation.  Hence our central hypothesis is that excess ?Syn monomers arising under both familial and `sporadic' PD conditions provide the substrate for adverse proteolytic truncation. To pursue this hypothesis, we propose (Aim 1) to phenotype in detail our novel ?2K? and ?3K? tetramer-abrogating mice that develop neuronal aggregates in nigra and cortex containing ?C-?Syn and show progressive motor deficits with prominent tremor. As a distinct but complementary approach (Aim 2), we will apply paraquat to activate calpain-1 and to see if the resultant increase ?C-?Syn alters the multimer-to-monomer ratio by sequestering monomers into aggregates. Mechanistically, cholesterol-rich caveolar membranes regulate Ca2+ entry and calpain-1 activity, so we will ask if the calpain-mediated ?C truncation induced by paraquat or the fPD mutations is associated with changes of caveolar structure/structural proteins. In sum, we will generate new tools including novel tetramer-abrogating ?Syn tg mice and paraquat-treated neurons to identify ?Syn forms and examine proteases underlying the adverse ?C truncation that contributes to the progressive aggregation centrally implicated in PD and DLB.  "

Additional data types not yet generated will include miRNA-seq, protein levels, DNA methylation, ChIP-seq, and DNase I hypersensitive site data among others. The ability to easily access, interpret and integrate these large data sets by a wide range of users with varying needs and skills is becoming of critical importance to leverage the full utility of the data. The GTEx Portal (http://gtexportal.org/) is the most widely accessed resource for the GTEx project, hosting all unprotected data, analysis results and numerous visual exploration tools, and has been enthusiastically received by the scientific community. To maximize the impact of this resource, we plan to expand the portal to: host data currently in production and new data types still to be generated; present novel and integrative analyses of existing data, and data from external sources; and to develop and share flexible tools for data analysis, visualization and access. Aim 1. We will host and support all open-access GTEx data and analysis results, performing systematic re-analyses of the data with new methods to reflect the state-of-the-art in RNA-seq analysis. We will add all new data sets to the portal to include novel assays (e.g. mi-RNA-seq, protein, methylation assays, etc/), derived analysis results (e.g. trans-eQTLs, splice- QTLs, GWAS enrichment analyses, protein-QTLs, etc.), and RNA-seq data sets from external investigators. Aim 2. We will work closely with both small focus groups of tool developers and engage our large user-base to identify and prioritize new features for development to display and integrate between multiple data types, and collaborate with other large genomic resources (e.g. ENCODE, UCSC and ENSEMBL browsers) to enable better integration of data sources and to enhance the utility and accessibility of the GTEx resource. Aim 3. We will automate and share all analysis pipeline tools with the scientific community. To support a wide range of user access needs, we will develop an open-source API to provide comprehensive data access, and also improve visualization tools and user-driven data analyses on the portal. To maximize use of the resource, we will design and offer training videos and outreach workshops.  "
"9296172","Advances in the field of mouse genetics, including truly remarkable new strategies for controlled gene  expression and engineering of mutant lines, have significantly enhanced the use of murine models in the study  of intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). The Preclinical Core (PC) offers innovative, multidisciplinary  approaches for measurement at the level of behavior, brain, and cell. These services are essential  for IDDRC projects utilizing mouse models in genetic, molecular, neurobiologlcal, and preclinical intervention  research. The Core has three components: the Mouse Behavioral Phenotyping Laboratory, the Confocal  and Multiphoton Imaging Facility, and the Brain Imaging Analysis Service (for processing data from  magnetic resonance (MRI) and diffusion tensor (DTI) imaging). By spanning multiple aspects of mouse model  evaluation and use, these components provide a basis for integrative, translational neuroscience within the  UNC IDDRC. The Core proposes four objectives to support high-caliber mouse model research:  A.I. Provide innovative and translational behavioral phenotyping for genetic and environmental  mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders. The Mouse Behavioral Phenotyping Laboratory offers  researchers a multifaceted test regimen, including assays for sensory, motor, social, emotional, and cognitive  function, and approaches for neonatal behavior and preclinical drug screens. The PC also provides expertise,  training, and access to a range of automated measurement systems for state-of-the-art phenotyping.  A.2. Provide consultation, hands-on training, and cutting-edge resources for confocal, multiphoton,  and widefield imaging. The Confocal and Multiphoton Imaging Facility offers a state-of-the-art microscopy  laboratory, with multiple systems for evaluation of neural tissue in vitro and in living mice. Facility staff provide  consultation and hands-on training in molecular and cellular microscopy techniques, including utilization of  optogenetic and photosensitive probes, automated time-lapse imaging of neurons and glia, and multiphoton  imaging of spatiotemporal dynamics in neuronal migration and connectivity in intact, living embryonic brains.  A.3. Develop, utilize, and disseminate advanced methods for analysis of MRI and DTI scans from  animal IDD models. The Brain Imaging Analysis Service devises innovative strategies for the processing and  interpretation of brain imaging data, and methods to track abnormalities in neural development and function.  The Service works to validate and optimize new methods to allow automated volumetric and connectivity  analysis in MRIs of the developing rodent brain, and to validate measures applicable to both human and  animal scans. Novel processing pipelines for segmentation and atlas-building, developmental brain atlases,  and other critical tools for morphometric and functional analyses, are made publicly available.  A.4. Facilitate integrative and multidisciplinary IDDRC research. The correlation of complementary  mouse phenotypes, such as behavioral responses, dendritic morphology, cortical architecture, and regional  brain volume and connectivity, provides a powerful approach to identify the mechanistic basis of abnormalities  relevant to neurodevelopmental disorders. By combining behavior, microscopy, and neuroimaging, the PC  offers IDDRC investigators the expertise, infrastructure, and collaborative opportunities for multidisciplinary  research using mouse models. The PC is also a source of information on services provided by other UNC  core facilities, and works to maintain strong connections with the Clinical Translational Core to enhance the  relevance of mouse model work to studies in humans."
"9333269","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Host response targeting of both immune and stromal components, represents a game changing opportunity to overcome cancer through the body's built in defense mechanisms. Our focus in this application is to exploit the host response through nano approaches for cancer disease management and treatment. We propose developing targeted methods for the delivery of biologics and, immunologic- modifiers and chemotherapies against melanoma and non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), utilizing innovative nanotechnologies developed here at UNC-Chapel Hill. We have proposed four projects in this proposal. The projects revolve around the central theme of exploiting the host response against tumors with an emphasis on the immune response. Project 1 is the designated basic science project since novel polymetformin nanoparticles are being proposed for more efficient and effective delivery of siRNA, which is a critical challenge for drug delivery The project targets Vemurafenib resistant melanoma, and emphasizes direct suppression of drug resistance that is coupled with a new vaccine approach. Project 2 evaluates ways to enhance the anti-tumor immune response through novel delivery of antigens via Particle Replication in Non-wetting Templates (PRINT(r)) nanoparticles. Unique adjuvants, such as Pathogen-associated Molecular Patterns, are being explored as well as the active suppression of blockers of host immunity in melanoma. Project 3 takes advantage of the biology of antigen release and the abscopal effect post irradiation through specifically designed nanoparticles to enhance antigen capture and the immune response to both primary tumors and metastases in melanoma. Project 4 uses polymeric micelles with high capacity loading to deliver therapeutics targeted to the tumor microenvironment as well as tumor cells in NSCLC. In summary, our Carolina CCNE is focused on improving cancer disease control and management to enhance treatment options for patients by the use of novel nanoparticles used in innovative ways that should have impact far beyond the specific disease conditions that are being studied."
"9321931","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek support for a Rare Lung Diseases clinical research Consortium (RLDC) facilitating clinical research, training, and education for a group of rare lung diseases based on molecular pathway-driven development of novel diagnostics and therapeutics. The proposed Specific Aims include 1) establish a Consortium focused to Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis (PAP), and Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (HPS), 2) conduct longitudinal and therapeutic clinical studies related to LAM, PAP, and HPS at abroad network of rare lung disease clinical centers established initially via LAM clinics, 3) conduct of a Pilot and Demonstration program for the development and evaluation of novel diagnostics, therapeutics, and outcome measures for these and additional 'on-deck' rare lung diseases, 4) provide clinical research training at RLDC clinical centers and attract new investigators to the field, and 5) develop rare lung disease educational materials for patients, medical providers, and the public. Synergies between diseases include the use of quantitative radiological outcome assessment, an emphasis on development and evaluation of blood-based biomarkers and diagnostic tests, and the evaluation of the natural history of each disease. We build on prior successes including development of novel diagnostics (in PAP and LAM), the first successful therapeutic trial for LAM conducted through the RLDC ('MILES'), longstanding partnerships with patient advocacy groups, and a track record of training and career development in rare lung diseases (including a former trainee who is now a project leader in this application). The network consists of three translational sites at Cincinnati Children's (the coordinating center), the University of Cincinnati in Cincinnati, Ohio (a co-directorship), and Vanderbilt, and clinical research sites selected from the existing LAM Clinic Network. Participating patient support groups include the LAM Foundation, PAP Foundation, HPS Network, and the Alpha-1 Foundation. These centers and Foundations are already closely integrated with clinical sites chosen from active networks of collaborating clinical centers that include over 28 sites in 22 states distributed throughout the United States. Participating translational centers will leverage resources from existing NIH Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) and a racially diverse population that includes pediatric opportunities. Each center provides ongoing longitudinal clinical studies, an excellent clinical training program,  and active clinical programs designed to test novel therapies, develop diagnostic tests and evaluate outcome measures that will lead to new therapies and improve the lives of affected"
"9374676","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cilia are cell projections built around a bundle of specialized microtubules (the axoneme) that mediate essential motile and sensory functions. Cilia propel cells, generate extracellular fluid flows, support signal transduction and release extracellular vesicles. The length of cilium is an important parameter. Motile cilia that are either too short or too long fail to generate or respond to hydrodynamic forces. In mammals, hedgehog signaling is compromised by mutations that alter the cilium length. Genetic studies led to the discovery of several highly conserved kinases that negatively regulate cilium length including: MAK/ICK, LF4/MOK, LF2/CCRK/DYF-18, CNK/NEK/NRK and LF5/CDKL5. Mutations in these kinases cause diseases (ciliopathies) including developmental disorders (endocrine-cerebro- osteodysplasia syndrome, short rib polydactyly syndrome), retinitis pigmentosa, polycystic kidney disease and juvenile epilepsy. How the activity of cilium length kinases is regulated and how they act to adjust cilium length is poorly understood. The steady-state cilium length is dependent on a balance between the rates of ciliary assembly (driven by intraflagellar transport that delivers precursors) and ciliary disassembly pathway that removes axoneme subunits. The identity of the sensor that measures cilium length is unknown. How the activity of cilium length kinases affects the executive pathways that adjust cilium length (intraflagellar transport and disassembly) is poorly understood. Identification of phosphorylation substrates of cilium length kinases will help in revealing the underlying mechanistic principle of cilium length sensing and adjustment. The cilium length kinases are conserved from ciliated protists to man. We will use a unicellular model with a high density of cilia, Tetrahymena thermophila, an excellent genetic and biochemical model, for a novel genetic suppressor screen, based on a gain of function mutation in a conserved cilium length kinase, LF4/MOK, that causes shortening of cilia and cell paralysis. We will use this screen and a new pipeline for comparative whole genome sequencing, to identify extragenic suppressions of LF4/MOK gain of function. This screen has strong potential for identification of novel LF4 interactors including its phosphorylation substrates, opposing phosphatases and upstream activators. The nature of LF4 interactors will dictate functional studies into the mechanism of sensing and execution of cilium length."
"9364386","Project Summary Persistent pain states, arising from inflammatory conditions, such as in arthritis, diabetes, HIV, and chemotherapy among others, have an extraordinary negative impact on quality of life. A common feature of these initiating events is the release of damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecules, which can activate Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4). Our previous studies suggest that TLR4 is critical in mediating the transition from acute to persistent pain. TLR4 as well as other inflammatory receptors localize to lipid raft microdomains on the plasma membrane. Lipid rafts, enriched with cholesterol and sphingomyelin, facilitate ligand-mediated receptor dimerization and downstream signaling. Removal of cholesterol from the plasma membrane reduces lipid rafts and often results in inhibition of receptor function. We have found that the secreted apoA-I binding protein (AIBP) accelerates cholesterol removal, disrupts lipid rafts, prevents TLR4 dimerization and inhibits microglia inflammatory responses to LPS. Furthermore, because AIBP binds to TLR4 and its affinity increases when TLR4 is activated by an agonist, we propose that AIBP targets cholesterol removal to lipids rafts harboring activated TLR4. In our recent work, we have also found that this mechanism is relevant to regulation of neuropathic pain states. Intrathecal injections of recombinant AIBP prevented LPS-induced tactile allodynia and, remarkably, reversed established cisplatin-induced allodynia. Based on these findings, we propose that targeted, AIBP- mediated disruption of lipid rafts and its effects upon TLR4 signaling can be a potential therapeutic strategy in treating neuropathic pain states. The Specific Aims of this proposal are: (1) to test the hypothesis that AIBP targets lipid rafts harboring activated TLR4; (2) to test the hypothesis that AIBP reduces glial activation and neuroinflammation in mouse models of neuropathic pain; and (3) to identify the origin and function of endogenous AIBP in the spinal cord. To test these hypothesis, we propose experiments, in vivo and in isolated glial cells, to elucidate the AIBP-TLR4 binding and lipid raft mechanism, and to characterize glial activation and neuroinflammation states. We will also make AIBP variants with mutated apoA-I or TLR4 binding interfaces to validate the proposed mechanism. Using our unique AIBP knockout and AIBP flox/flox mice, we will identify the role of endogenous AIBP in lipid raft regulation and neuroinflammation. In summary, our proposed experiments will elucidate the mechanisms by which AIBP reduces neuroinflammation and alleviates neuropathic pain. Our studies may also suggest that raising AIBP levels in the CNS may be a novel therapeutic approach to treat persistent pain states."
"9377292","Scleroderma/Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a prototypic fibrotic disease that affects multiple organs including the skin and lung. Lung fibrosis is the leading cause of death in SSc patients. The hallmark of fibrosis is the disruption of extracellular matrix (ECM) homeostasis, with accumulation of ECM components and subsequent organ failure. However, the basic mechanisms responsible for the initiation and perpetuation of fibrosis are incompletely understood, which impedes the development of effective therapies. One of the hotly debated questions is the origin of fibrogenic cells. We identified an extensive population of pericytes in normal lung, defined by FoxD1 lineage tracing and pericyte marker expression. Our preliminary data, using genetic fate mapping, demonstrate that FoxD1 derived lung pericytes are a major source of myofibroblast progenitors following bleomycin-induced lung injury. However, whether pericytes are a major source of collagen and myofibroblasts in skin remains unexplored. We identified a peptide derived from endostatin, named E4, that is effective at reducing skin and lung fibrosis if given subcutaneously, intraperitoneally, or intratracheally. However, it is unclear whether E4 targets pericytes or pericyte-derived myofibroblasts in lung or skin, key myofibroblast progenitors. Our preliminary data suggests that E4 treatment of pericytes decreases markers of fibrosis. Understanding the relevant target cell type will be important in optimizing the translation of E4 to the clinic. Based on these findings we hypothesize that activated pericytes contribute to myofibroblast populations in both skin and lungs, and pericytes are an important target cell for the anti-fibrotic activities of E4. To investigate these hypotheses, we propose to: 1. Compare the role of lung and skin pericytes as myofibroblast progenitors in murine fibrosis models. 2. Compare the distribution and function of pericytes from lung and skin from normal and scleroderma patients. 3. Determine if lung and skin pericytes are a target of the novel anti-fibrotic peptide E4. If successful, our findings will have significant impact on our understanding of skin and lung fibrosis in SSc, a disease that remains incurable and facilitate the translation and development of an anti-fibrotic peptide."

"9321934","Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is characterized by accumulation of surfactant in pulmonary alveoli resulting in respiratory failure and increased infection risk in most patients due to the defective granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) signaling. Disruption is caused by GM-CSF autoantibodies (GMAbs) in autoimmune PAP (aPAP) accounting for 90% of cases or by mutations in the GM-CSF receptor a or p genes [CSF2RA, CSF2RB] in hereditary PAP (hPAP) in 5% or less. Historically, a diagnosis of PAP has required a lung biopsy. However, while a lung biopsy can determine if PAP is present, it cannot identify the disease responsible and therefore does not inform prognosis or therapeutic alternatives. This is a critical limitation since therapeutic options, treatment responses, and prognosis vary widely depending on which disease caused PAP. We developed a set of blood tests that can diagnose aPAP and hPAP with high specificity and sensitivity. We recently developed an approach using a dried blood spot card (DBSC) for blood collection, which patients can use to collect their own samples and send them by mail in an envelope to the test center. While a pivotal study has demonstrated that inhaled GM-CSF therapy of aPAP is effective, further studies are needed to optimize the protocol in a larger group of patients. Importantly, to translate these novel findings into clinical practice, it will be necessary to organize the PAP patient community and establish the natural history of PAP. The long term goal of this research is to improve the diagnosis and therapy of PAP. The objectives of this application are to evaluate blood-based diagnostics, identify novel disease mechanisms and HLA associations. measure the incidence and prevalence of PAP in the United States (US), and define the natural history of aPAP and hPAP. Our central hypothesis is that an observational study with cross-sectional and longitudinal components will inform the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and natural history of PAP and will facilitate the conduct of planned, future therapeutic trials in people with PAP. This hypothesis will be addressed in the following Aims. In Aim 1, we will optimize and validate DBSC testing for the diagnosis of aPAP and study the epidemiology of PAP in the US. In Aim 2, we will identify human alleles associated with an increased risk of developing PAP. In Aim 3, we will utilize DSBC testing to conduct prospective, longitudinal observation study to evaluate the natural history of PAP. Anticipated results will validate novel blood-tests for the diagnosis of PAP, and identify new mutation(s) as a novel cause of hPAP, define the incidence and prevalence of PAP, potential HLA allele-specific associations of aPAP, and comprise the first prospective natural history study of PAP. This project will impact the field by transforming how PAP is diagnosed: using a simple, inexpensive, self-administered test that improves access for patients in remote locations, and by organizing the patient community for planned therapeutic trials. Finally, we will help organize the PAP patient community for planned therapeutic trials by creating a National PAP registry using inexpensive methods integrated with our CCTST."
"9321293","SUMMARY Loss of dopaminergic neurons is the principal cellular pathology underlying Parkinson's disease (PD). A fundamental but unresolved challenge is how to replenish dopaminergic neurons and restore the neurotransmitter dopamine-regulated neural circuits. Transplantation of dopaminergic neurons into the striatum can reverse behavioral deficits of PD, highlighting the therapeutic value of striatal dopamine. However, the efficacy of transplanted stem cells is limited by the survival and integration of induced neurons, as well as, the potential for tumorigenesis. The long-term goal of this proposal is to define a new regenerative strategy for neuronal induction using patient-specific endogenous glial cells. Our preliminary results show that resident glia can be in vivo reprogrammed into neuroblasts in the adult striatum. These neuroblasts proliferate and generate mature neurons when supplied with neurotrophic factors or the small chemical compounds valproic acid. Most importantly, the newly generated striatal neurons can functionally integrate into local neuronal circuits. Three aims are proposed in this application to further analyze and optimize the in vivo reprogramming process: 1) to optimize the reprogramming process for the generation of dopaminergic neurons, 2) to functionally characterize these induced dopaminergic neurons in the adult brain, and 3) to examine translatability of induced dopaminergic neurons. The results of this work may lead to an entirely novel treatment paradigm for PD."
"9315480","PROJECT SUMMARY  Meiosis is a complex, highly conserved process that ensures that the parental genomes are properly distributed to the gametes to prevent aneuploidy in the offspring. Model organisms such as yeast, flies, and worms have contributed the bulk of what is understood about meiosis: how the chromosomes replicate, condense, and how the protein zipper called the Synaptonemal Complex assembles between the homologous parental chromosomes. The machinery that generates the double-stranded DNA breaks required for recombination, and the processes that guide DNA repair to yield cross-overs between the homologs have also been highly studied. In contrast, little is understood about how the homologous chromosome sets recognize each other, exclude heterologous interactions, and pair and align with each other in any organism. Without proper homolog recognition and alignment, all other meiotic processes are usually rendered moot, since recombination-mediated attachments must only occur between homologs for proper distribution of the genome into the gametes. Most eukaryotic genomes are highly repetitive, thus homology recognition may not include, and may actively prevent, recognition by DNA sequence alone. DNA sequences may play some role, but other features of meiotic chromosomes must contribute to homolog identity.  One feature unique to each chromosome is their linear arrangement of genes. The gene pattern for each chromosome is further refined by which genes are active during meiosis. Recent results from a variety of species indicate histone modifications play important and conserved roles in meiotic events. Furthermore, there is evidence that readers of histone modifications are also important for meiotic processes, including homolog pairing and alignment. We propose that the histone modifications produced by active gene expression create a stable ?epigenetic bar code? that is unique to each chromosome. This bar code is then recognized by ?epigenetic readers? that provide a Velcro-like interface in which the most stable linear alignments between all chromosomes in a set are those between homologs. The dynein-dependent forces that are known to pull on the aligned chromosomes during meiotic pairing provide the force required to select for maximal alignment of the bar-code, and hence interpret homology. The C. elegans germline represents an ideal system to test the predictions of the epigenetic bar-code model, since the writers and readers of the histone modifications in germ cells are largely known. Importantly, mutations in the enzymes involved are known to have only minor effects on germ cell transcription, which allows for testing of the hypothesis with minimal interference from indirect effects. We are thus poised to investigate the role of chromatin architecture produced by transcription dependent patterns of histone modifications in meiotic chromosome homolog recognition and pairing, which will provide the first mechanistic insights into this poorly understood but highly essential process."
"9333270","Small Animal Imaging Core Abstract  As the preclinical imaging has been increasingly used in drug discovery and development, the  Small Animal Imaging (SAI) core has become an indispensable component in the proposed  CCNE grant, with the goal of providing cutting edge imaging techniques and expertise to  facilitate nanoparticle technology development in each project. The SAI core has been long  involved in the CCNE projects since the CCNE phase I, and has made substantial contributions  in the nanotechnology development by providing comprehensive support on in vivo optical  imaging, microCT imaging, MR imaging, PET/CT, SPECT/CT, ultrasound imaging, and the  combined multimodality imaging technique on ten projects in the past two CCNE phases. On  the other hand, the imaging core has had significant expansion in the past ten years. Our  imaging equipment has increased from one MRI and one optical system in 2004 to current  eleven imaging systems covering almost all the animal imaging modalities. The recent  relocation to the new building has expanded the facility space to more than 40,000 sq ft with  upgraded lab space. The new cyclotron and radiochemistry facility further enhanced the  molecular imaging capability, enabling on-demand imaging probes produced nearby and novel  imaging probes development. Faculty recruitment on radiochemistry and radiopharmacy has  added the imaging core with the expertise on radiosynthesis and translational imaging studies.  Operated as a recharge core facility, the imaging core has also made considerable  enhancement in the infrastructures on scheduling, registration, animal support, protocol  development, system maintenance, and billing.  Leveraging on these impressive resources and capacities the SAI core aims to provide  advanced imaging technology to facilitate the proposed projects. Two specific aims have been  proposed: 1) Optimize optical and PET imaging methods for biodistribution studies; 2) Develop  multimodality imaging approach to evaluate cancer treatment efficacy. Specifically, optical  imaging and PET/CT imaging will be used to characterize developed nanoparticles or  nanodrugs in terms of PK and biodistribution in the four projects. In addition, multimodality  imaging, including optical, ultrasound, microCT, and PET/CT imaging will be used to evaluate  treatment efficacy in project 1-4. Overall, we believe that the enhanced imaging capability and  infrastructure in the SAI core will greatly benefit the nanodrug development, and facilitate the  success of the proposed projects."
"9391524","PROJECT SUMMARY In the oral environment, interactions between lectin-like adhesins on bacteria and complementary glycan motifs on mucosal epithelia and saliva-coated tooth surfaces play central roles in initial bacterial colonization. Lectin-glycan binding also is important for bacterial coadhesion, leading to the formation of multi-species microbial biofilms that have the potential to turn into pathogenic habitats causing dental, oral, and perhaps systemic disease. Considering (a) the multitude of bacterial species identified in oral biofilms, (b) the rich diversity of species-typical sialoglycans found on salivary glycoproteins, and (c) the innumerable glycan motifs expressed on the surface of other bacteria, it is likely that many more unidentified lectin-like bacterial adhesins exist in the oral microbiome, beyond the few ones currently known. In our preliminary studies, we have focused on a well characterized class of bacterial adhesins, the serine-rich protein (SRR) adhesins of oral streptococci. We were able to demonstrate that the glycan binding regions of these SRR proteins (SRR-BRs) can be forged by recombinant DNA techniques into highly specific probes for detecting and localizing glycan receptor structures in a variety of applications. We also identified hitherto unknown SRR-BRs that exhibit novel glycan-binding specificities. The overall objective of this project is to expand and greatly diversify the tool box of available SRR-BRs by harvesting novel SRR-BRs from the oral microbiomes of other mammals that express strikingly different sialoglycan termini. We will also use a diverse panel of human and animal red blood cells and synthetic glycan-functionalized particles to identify additional SRR-BRs with novel glycan-binding properties. All SRR-BRs created in this project will be tested and cross-validated for their usefulness as simple, affordable and easy-to-use and well-controlled tools to probe the glycomes of biological or pathological samples. This work will also greatly complement, expand and diversify prior efforts at tool generation initiated under earlier Common Fund mechanisms. The specific aims of the project are to 1. Harness previously identified SRR-BRs as glycan-binding probes and determine their glycan- binding specificities, using available glycan array technology. 2. Identify additional SRR-BRs with novel glycan-binding specificities to further expand the tool box of available glycan-binding molecules 3. Demonstrate the usefulness of novel SRR-BRs to probe glycomes of the oral environment, the blood circulation, and other diverse biological samples."
"9298404","The Jackson Laboratory Cancer Center (JAXCC) is undergoing a profound expansion of its membership, driven by new cancer-focused leadership and the opening ofthe JAX Genomic Medicine campus. Combined with the revitalization of the program at JAX Mammalian Genetics (Bar Harbor), the JAX will more than triple the cancer-focused faculty. The recruitment of eight new members since January 2012, when Dr. Liu became the JAXCC Director demonstrates the feasibility of this plan. The new JAXCC members bring new cancer research and technological expertise and a strong translational research capability to the Cancer Center. Institutional commitment to these new investigators is estimated at $19 million over the next five years.    Developmental funds are a crucial factor in assuring the JAXCC's continued growth and productivity. In the previous grant cycle, new investigator funds were used to support seven junior faculty members. Funds are requested for partial support of new investigators, which will be leveraged by significant institutional commitment of funds. The strategic plan calls for the recruitment of 8 additional JAXCC members over the next 5 years, with institutional commitment estimated at $22 million. The overall goals in recruiting to the Cancer Center, determined in consultation with internal and external advisory committees include: 1) expanding the focus on cancer systems biology and cancer genomics; 2) engaging translational sciences that include cancer pharmacology/systems pharmacology, chemical biology, and molecular pathology to enrich the basic science focus; and 3) strategically recruiting faculty who will strengthen orthogonal approaches to cancer, such as experts in systems computational biology, and aging. The result will be a cancer focus that comprises research focused on human genetics and genomics in Connecticut, tightly integrated with mouse genomics expertise in Maine to model the complexity of the human cancer genome.     The pilot project program is an essential part of the plan to achieve the JAXCC's strategic goals. Projects are awarded based on the quality ofthe science, their anticipated contribution to one or more strategic goals, and the plan for securing federal funding, especially from NCI, for the mature project. In the previous grant cycle, 12 proposals were funded, including 9 since 2012. CCSG ($156,556) and institutional ($367,645) funds supported the project. In total, the funded projects support collaborations among 9 JAXCC members and 8 external institutions. One publication has resulted and three are in preparation. Nine grant proposals based on those pilots have been submitted to peer-reviewed agencies to date; 2 were awarded, and 3 are under review.    An increase in funds is requested for expansion of the pilot project program, with at least a one to one match from institutional funds. Projects that develop translational technologies that will move basic science to clinical impact are of special priority. Oversight ofthe program has been strengthened. The Scientific Executive Committee (SEC) sets the priorities for the annual proposal solicitation, works with applicants to refine a research plan that achieves the strategic goal(s), approves awards, and provides scientific guidance for the project's duration. Dr. Tennent, Associate Director for Research Administration, monitors progress of each pilot toward stated milestones and tracks resulting grant and manuscript submissions."
"9387243","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common and debilitating mental disorder that has a profound public health impact and for which the disease burden falls disproportionately on African Americans (AAs). Socially adverse experiences of discrimination and isolation, stressful life events, and low socioeconomic position (SEP) have a profound impact on mental and physical health, with AAs being more likely to encounter many of these exposures; yet how these exposures become translated into ill health, in particular poor mental health, is unclear. To address this gap in knowledge, this application seeks to determine whether social adversity among AA residents of Detroit impacts glucocorticoid receptor regulatory network (GRRN) DNA methylation to lay the foundation for future risk of psychopathology. Exposure to stressful and traumatic events produces a physiologic cascade that includes epigenetic modification of genes whose activity contributes to psychopathological development. In particular, stress hormones (e.g. glucocorticoids) and genomic factors associated with them have been strongly linked to etiology of PTSD and other stress-related mental disorder. It remains unknown to what extent socially adverse exposures such as low SEP, discrimination, loneliness, and stressful life events impact DNA methylation in genes belonging to this pathway. We hypothesize that DNA methylation of GRRN genes in leukocytes is associated with prospective risk of PTSD and traumatic stress in Detroit-dwelling AAs, due to their role in the physiology of stress in both central and peripheral tissues. We further hypothesize that exposure to socioeconomic and psychosocial stressors impact DNA methylation variation in GRRN genes, laying the foundation for vulnerability to psychopathology, including post-traumatic stress symptom severity, depression symptom severity, and generalized anxiety symptom severity. This proposal brings together a strong investigative team with extensive expertise in social epidemiology, epigenetics, PTSD, and AA health. Our team will leverage data from a comprehensive, population based cohort study of mental health in AAs, the Detroit Neighborhood Health Study (DNHS).

In addition, in vitro cell culture experiments will be leveraged to test GRRN dysregulation in neuronal cell lines, and will test the functional significance of GRRN DNA methylation variation."
"9299936","Autosomal dominant facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is among the most prevalent muscular dystrophies, affecting 1 in 8,333 to 1 in 20,000 individuals. FSHD was formally classified as a major form of muscular dystrophy in 1954, but the pathogenic events leading to the disease have only recently started coming into focus. Several studies now support an FSHD pathogenesis model involving aberrant expression of the DUX4 gene, which encodes a myotoxic transcription factor. The emergence of DUX4 represented a momentum shift in the FSHD field as it provided an important target for therapy design. Indeed, as FSHD is currently untreatable, developing effective FSHD therapies is a critical need in the field. We hypothesized that an FSHD treatment should center on inhibiting toxic DUX4 expression in skeletal muscles. The objective of this proposal is to develop safe and effective prospective FSHD therapies aimed at reducing toxic DUX4 with RNAi approaches in two novel mouse models of FSHD, using therapeutic non-coding RNAs delivered by adeno- associated viral vectors (AAV). We have designed three Specific Aims to accomplish this objective. Upon completion of these aims, we expect to produce pre-clinical data supporting the translation of a new AAV- based RNAi therapy for FSHD that can be ultimately used for translation toward our goal of clinical application."
"9325575","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):    Despite the widespread use of anti-retroviral therapy in AIDS patients, the prevalence of HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders (HAND), including Asymptomatic Neurocognitive Impairment (ANI), Mild Neurocognitive Disorder (MND), and HIV-Associated Dementia (HAD), remains significantly high. Even mild forms of neurocognitive impairment may impact quality of life and antiretroviral drug adherence in H1V+ individuals (McArthur, 2004). The reason CNS complications may develop or persist in treated individuals is not known, but failure to eliminate viral reservoirs and inadequate drug penetration to the CNS could play a role in allowing low level viral replication to persist. For these reasons the development of novel compounds to treat HIV encephalitis (HIVE) is an objective of significant biomedical importance. In this project, we embark on proof-of-concept studies in nonhuman primates to test novel anti-Vif candidate drugs in support of efforts to accelerate basic and translational discoveries toward the advancement of new drug therapeutics for HAND. HIV-1 Vif is a highly attractive yet unrealized therapeutic target for the intervention of HlV-1 replication.       HIV-1 Vif is essential for primate lentivirus replication in vitro. We have identified a lead Vif antagonist (RN18) that exhibits exquisite antiviral specificity against Vif-dependent viral replication. We plan to evaluate the in vivo efficacy ofthe most promising RN18 analogs in proof-of principal studies in a simian model of neuroAIDS. Vif antagonists with the most desirable antiviral activities, validated mechanism of action (Projects 1 and 2), and acceptable toxicity and pharmacokinetic profiles in rodents will be examined for in vivo antiviral activity in a monkey model of SIV-induced encephalitis (SIVE). We anticipate in vivo analysis of 2-3 Vif antagonists/year in groups of 6 animals each."
"9375737","Interstitial fluid (ISF) flow has many functions including the maintenance of ionic balances, flushing of wastes and providing a route for migration of both cell signals and cells. Recently, the use of multiphoton microscopy, which enables in vivo studies with cellular resolution, has resulted in novel findings, especially in the brain, about dynamics and anatomy involved in ISF flow. Notably, ISF flow may be critical in dealing with protein accumulation in Alzheimer's disease and is regulated by sleep. Although much progress has been made, there remains controversy about some of the fundamentals regarding ISF flow. Much of this may be due to complications in the experimental methods. Studies to date require the injection of tracers which can be imaged by multiphoton microscopy or other imaging methods such as MRI. However, the process of injection of the tracers may itself affect the flow due to the delicate balance of pressures within the brain. In addition, injected tracers do not mimic the origin of proteins, wastes and cytokines made by the brain. Studies are limited to superficial sites accessible by current generation imaging technologies. This proposal generates optical and biological tools that address these short comings using in vivo multiphoton microscopy. First, in a new way to generate tracers in situ, cells within the tissue of interests will be transduced so that they secrete fluorescent proteins into the extracellular space. This will be used to resolve existing controversies about the route of ISF flow within the brain. Second, the newly discovered brain lymphatics are thought to link to the peri or paravacular spaces that serve as conduits for ISF. This work will use the new secrete tracers to answer whether and how these lymphatic channels link to the these spaces. This fluid flow may be altered in different conditions, so this will be studied in normal function mimicking sleep and waking, as well as with a stroke model. Third, three-photon microscopy now enables much deeper imaging than traditional two-photon microscopy. This enables imaging of anatomy previously not accessible. This work will study ISF flow in the hippocampus, a critical brain structure in memory and cognition, that seems to be particularly vulnerable to disruptions to ISF. This work will establish novel tools that can enable new experiments to address ISF in many systems."
"9506091","Project Abstract Tetra Discovery Partners is seeking Phase II SBIR funding for a multiple ascending dose, human Phase 1 clinical trial of BPN14770 to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and cognitive profile in healthy young and elderly male and female subjects. BPN14770 is a first-in-class phosphodiesterase-4D negative allosteric modulator (PDE4D-NAM) that targets the protein kinase A - cAMP response element binding protein (PKA- CREB) pathway for synaptic plasticity. The compound has the potential to show broad cognitive efficacy across a range of neurologic, psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Lead indications are the improvement of cognitive function in the elderly with age-associated memory impairment and in patients with Alzheimer?s disease. Prior experience with BPN14770 in a single ascending dose, human Phase 1 clinical trial indicates that the compound is absorbed after dosing by an oral route, reaches a level in human blood projected to show cognitive efficacy based on animal studies, and is well tolerated. The clinical objectives of the multiple ascending dose study are the following: 1. To evaluate the safety and tolerability profile of multiple oral ascending dose levels of BPN14770 in  healthy young (21-45 yr) and elderly (>65 yr) subjects. 2. To characterize the steady state plasma PK profile of BPN14770 following multiple oral administration  in healthy young and elderly subjects. 3. To provide assessment of the cognitive effect of BPN14770 in healthy young and elderly subjects. The study will enroll up to 84 subjects. The number of subjects to be enrolled is a balance between the need to establish safety by exposing a limited number of subjects to the experimental drug versus enrolling an expanded number of subjects to explore potential efficacy. The study will enroll sufficient subjects to obtain preliminary cognitive data to inform Phase 1b and Phase 2a studies, but is not powered to detect small changes in cognition that might be clinically relevant in patients. Steady state PK parameters will be compared between young subjects and the initial cohort of elderly subjects and an adjustment in dose will be made if needed. As this is the first multiple dose study of BPN14770 in humans, safety assessment in young subjects is needed before evaluation of the drug in more vulnerable, elderly subjects. Cognitive assessments will include measures of verbal learning and memory, visual learning (pattern separation), visual paired associate learning and measures of visual and verbal memory with 24 hr delayed recall. PDE4D is a well validated target for improving cognition through modulation of the PKA-CREB pathway for memory consolidation. Compared to the assessment of immediate memory, there have been few attempts to assess the effects of investigational drugs on longer forms of memory. Should the Phase 1a study provide an indication of cognitive benefit in elderly subjects, a larger Phase 1b trial will be designed to confirm and extend the results of the initial trial in elderly subjects with age-associated memory impairment."
"9319735","CORE B - This program project will investigate the effects of thoracic level spinal cord transection on lower urinary tract dysfunction using various animal models based on C57BL/10 mice (Projects 1, 2 and 3) and Sprague Dawley rats (Project 4). These models include spinal cord transected, pudendal nerve cut and ureter diverted adult mice or rats, neonatal rats and matched controls. The different projects will also use models and controls where the bladder, dorsal root ganglia or striated external urethral sphincter is injected with pseudorabies virus (PRV) linked with the genetically encoded Ca2+-indicator, GCaMP4, or GFP or RFP fluorescent indicators. PRV only transfects nerves and, depending upon the viral strain, is transported by the afferent or efferent nerves to dorsal root ganglia or spinal motoneurons in only a retrograde direction, or both retrograde and anteriograde directions. Within the spinal cord, PRV crosses synapses and is transported transneuronally in a retrograde manner to interneurons located at upstream sites on reflex pathways Animal Core B will secure and maintain the animals for the different projects. Animal orders, surgeries, postoperative care and record keeping will be carried out by the fulltime Assistant Core Director. The optimal animal numbers for each set of experiments have been determined and will continue to be adjusted with the assistance of the program's experienced statistician and his assistant. Thus, the animal core will offer the advantages of reproducibility, ease of data comparison across projects and time- and cost-effectiveness. These advantages will be further enhanced by the different projects using multiple tissues from the same animals. Animal Core B will closely interact with Imaging Core A and the project directors to effectively schedule animal preparation and usage."
"9379612","Abstract: The human body is comprised of a large collection of diverse cell types, each providing a specialized and context-specific function. The establishment and maintenance of a cell's identity is largely driven by chromatin structure. Novel genomic tools, such as ATAC-seq, enable highly multiplexed readout of regulatory and functional elements in the genome; however, these approaches only infer the chromatin structure and regulation but do not capture how the structural architecture of the genome is related to regulation and function. Here, we propose to leverage the existing expertise between the Chen and Buenrostro labs by combining fluorescent in situ sequencing, super-resolution microscopy, and ATAC-seq to develop and validate in situ ATAC-seq and ATAC-ExSeq, novel technologies that directly sequence genomic regulatory elements within the context of the 3D architecture of the genome. Our approach will involve the development of molecular biology protocols in conjunction with complementary hardware and software platforms. We will utilize these technologies to characterize the structural organization of the epigenome as well as explore multi-modal in situ assays for transcription factor binding and RNA co-localization. These in situ technologies will represent a fundamentally new and enabling capability for studying chromatin architecture and single-cell epigenomics."
"9367045","PROJECT SUMMERY Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a common, life-threatening event that is associated with poor patient outcomes. Only ~30% of patients survive to hospital admission and less than 10% are ultimately discharged alive. Yet as a recent Institute of Medicine (IOM) report highlighted, some communities have been consistently more successful in responding to and treating OHCA than others. While this is largely believed to be due to the adoption of key care processes by emergency medical services (EMS) agencies in the pre-hospital setting, how these processes are actually utilized in routine practice and the underlying factors contributing to their successful implementation is largely unknown. Further, an integrative systems approach that examines the interaction of EMS agencies with other important stakeholders who provide care before and after EMS arrives ? such as first-responders (e.g., police, fire) and hospitals ? has not been undertaken. A better understanding and dissemination of strategies to improve care processes employed by high-performing EMS agencies across the continuum of OHCA care is a critical yet unfulfilled step for improving outcomes. Accordingly, the Enhanced Pre-Hospital Outcomes for Cardiac Arrest (EPOC) study will lay the foundation for future quality improvement efforts in OHCA through the following three aims: (1) Identify top- and bottom-performing EMS agencies in survival for OHCA.; (2) Define `best practices' at top-performing EMS agencies; (3) Validate factors associated with high survival at top-performing EMS agencies. We will use a sequential mixed methods approach to accomplish these aims. We build on extensive prior work by our investigative team to systematically understand factors associated with delivering optimal care in other emergency settings (mass casualty incidents, heart attacks, in- hospital cardiac arrest) and leverage our team's multidisciplinary expertise in emergency care, cardiology, clinical epidemiology, and mixed methods research. Findings from this study will be used to construct a toolkit of `best practices' ? the EPOC Toolkit ? that may be implemented by EMS agencies both within and beyond CARES through key state and national partners to improve OHCA outcomes in communities across the U.S."

"9409639","PROJECT SUMMARY Asians Americans are among the fastest growing minority groups in the United States, the same as HIV epidemics in Asian Americans. According to the New York City census, Asian American is the only racial/ethnic category showing an increase in HIV diagnosis compared to Black, Hispanic, White and Native American from 2001 to 2013. Asian Americans is ?a forgotten population,? whose HIV prevention and treatment needs have long been ignored and specific research on Asian Americans with HIV infections is sparse. A variety of cultural factors may affect individuals seeking HIV-related care and treatment. These factors include HIV stigma and discrimination against homosexuals, lack of social support and/or immigration issues. In addition, among Asian American immigrants, research indicates that lack of support from the family, poor English language ability, and the length of residence in the United States are all related to acculturative stress and poor self-management behavior. For HIV-positive Asian Americans, managing the disease can be a major concern?particularly in cultures that offer HIV-positive individuals few resources to understand and cope with the disease. Self-management is a process used to identify illness needs and activate resources for living with a disease like HIV. HIV-positive individuals who self-manage are expected to recognize HIV-related symptoms, decide when to alert their medical providers, and evaluate the results from treatment strategies. Not surprisingly, there is a paucity of data about self-management, including ART adherence, stress, and stigma among Asian Americans in the U.S. To this end, in this pilot project, we aim to improve the understanding of self-management barriers and facilitators among HIV-positive Asian Americans. This includes better understanding how they manage their physical and psychological discomforts, ART adherence, and quality of life, and how clinicians assess the need and readiness for self- and family-management intervention. In-depth interviews with 20-30 HIV-positive Asian Americans who have been diagnosed within last 5 years and 20-30 of their family caregivers will be conducted over two time points. Specific Aims are 1. To deepen understanding of the sociocultural and family context and characterize facilitators and barriers to self-management of Asian Americans living with HIV. 2. To assess the need, acceptability and readiness for an HIV self- and family management-based intervention. The preliminary data obtained from this project will be used to inform the development and testing of a self- and family management intervention to improve health outcomes in this population."
"9444560","The role of APOE genotype in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains one of the most critical questions in AD research. Over the past few years, we have pursued an interesting hypothesis that APOE genotype alters normal brain neurochemistry and structure early in life, generating an environment that alters the risk of AD with aging. Our previous studies of APOE knock-in mice have demonstrated that, even in young control mouse brains, APOE genotype affects brain lipid biochemistry, neuronal structure, and spatial learning. In exploring the cause of these various effects, we are now testing the hypothesis that early alterations of brains in APOE4 individuals are due to differences in normal lipid metabolism in astrocytes and neurons. In preliminary studies, we found that APOE isolated from the brain exists in two separate populations: either modified and water soluble, or unmodified and membrane associated. New mass spectrometry approaches allowed us to define that soluble APOE was glycosylated at several sites with several types of glycans; most of the modified APOE in the CNS was not found in the plasma (particularly with unique modification of APOE in its lipid binding domain). In vivo studies showed that APOE4 was less lipidated in CSF lipoproteins compared to APOE2 and APOE3, and that APOE4 mice have altered brain lipid homeostasis. Finally, we found that APOE4-associated phenotypes in mice were rescued by an AD preventative treatment. In this work, we propose to define how brain lipid homeostasis is affected by APOE isoforms, including the newly identified glycoforms. In Aim 1, we will define how APOE modifications alter APOE metabolism, trafficking, and function in the CNS. For these studies, we will identify and quantify new post-translational modifications of APOE across tissues, and develop new astrocyte culture models for expression and modulation of human glyco-APOE isoforms. In Aim 2, we will determine whether APOE4 causes poor lipid efflux in vitro and in vivo, leading to increased activation of LXR targets in mouse and human brains. We will use computer modeling to test the effects of glyco-APOE species on APOE tertiary structure and on APOE binding to CNS lipoproteins. In Aim 3, we will test whether APOE4 causes poor lipid uptake in vitro, leading to changes in neuronal APOE metabolism. We will use glial and neuronal cultures to define how APOE modification changes as APOE travels through CNS compartments. Finally, in Aim 4, we will test whether approaches that prevent AD in mice and humans (anti-inflammatory drugs and exercise/environmental enrichment) affect brain lipid metabolism and brain structure/function. We will test whether our new markers that are affected by the presence of APOE4, including the CNS-specific glycoforms, respond to conditions that reduce AD risk. Thus, this proposal provides new mechanistic insight into the post-translational modification of APOE in the CNS and how the complex set of APOE isoforms in the brain modulate lipid metabolism in ways that could lead to increased risk of AD."
"9416212","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The sequencing of the human genome marked the beginning of a collective scientific expedition to understand complex organisms. Genes, of course, merely contain the instructions for which proteins will populate the cell. Untangling the multi-faceted networks that regulate complex organisms and their diseases will require innovative technologies to globally monitor many classes of biomolecules, including nucleic acids, proteins, and metabolites. High-throughput technologies for gene and transcript measurement are well-developed and broadly accessible, and, as such, have had a fantastic and transformative impact on modern biology and medicine. For numerous reasons, methods for global analysis of proteins and metabolites - crucial biological effector molecules - are less evolved and markedly less accessible. The overarching mission of my program is to (1) facilitate expedient, comprehensive analysis of proteins and metabolites by innovating new mass spectrometric technologies and (2) apply these techniques to advance biomedical research. To accomplish these goals we center our efforts on four main areas: Instrumentation and Informatics, Proteomic Methodology, Metabolomics, and Biomedical Applications. First, leveraging our extensive electron transfer dissociation (ETD) development history, we plan to expand our ability to interrogate many currently intractable peptides, post-translational modification (PTMs), and other biomolecules. Second, with these and other tools, we will simplify and expedite proteome analysis; we envision analyzing an entire proteome (>10,000 proteins) or PTMome (>10,000 phosphorylation sites) in hours, or even minutes. Third, by development of novel chemical instrumentation and software tools, we will advance the field of metabolite profiling and discovery. Finally, the above mentioned technologies are most meaningfully developed in the context of relevant biology and, therefore, we plan to apply our innovative tools to many cutting-edge biomedical projects."
"9324345","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary/Abstract  Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a debilitating and often fatal disease for which there is currently no cure. The environmental and genetic factors that drive susceptibility to the development of PH and responses to therapy are poorly understood. This observation is particularly true in specific demograghic (i.e. male) and clinical (i.e. scleroderma) cohorts noted to experience greater risk and severity of PH. Additionally, little is known about the impact of ethnicity on disease severity These information gaps are exacerbated by the perplexing assortment of clinical characteristics, histopathological entities and responses to therapy that constitute the 5 categories within the current World Symposium classification of PH patients. While providing a framework for the diagnosis and treatment, the current classification has serious limitations in clinical practice. Derived in part from functional measurements with limited predictive ability, more disease-specific measurements are needed that predict survival, quality of life, progression and response to therapy. The University of Arizona (UA) Medical Center is a major regional referral center for treatment of patients with PH, including a large population of Latino PH patients. Our program has an over-representation of Latinos with PH across all 5 Groups (25% Latinos with high Native American admixture with Group 1-PH). Based on our exceptionally strong published sub-phenotyping studies in well-defined PH subgroups (CTEPH, PH-associated with sickle cell disease) and patients with complex lung disorders (sarcoidosis, IPF, lung transplant), we propose to employ the state-of-the-art physiologic, genomic and epigenetic strategies to sub-phenotype Latino and non-Latino PH patients across the 5 PH categories. SA #1 will leverage our advanced diagnostics clinical algorithm, incorporating cardiac MRI, echocardiography, and catheterization to reliably measure ventriculo- vascular coupling (VVC) and pulmonary vascular impedance and cardiopulmonary exercise tesing to physiologically phenotype Latino and non-Latino PH patients across all Group 1-5 PH phenotypes. SA #2 will generate genome-wide, genetic/epigenetic molecular signatures in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to sub-phenotype PH patients across all 5 WHO PH categories. These studies will include genome- wide gene expression, miRNA arrays, and DNA methylation arrays. SA #3 will extend out prior studies utilizing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) and utilize whole-genome sequencing to identify novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are over-represented in Latinos with category- specific PH. We will further examine the relationship of SA #1-3 to the clinically important composite variable, time to clinical worsening (TTCW). Together, the large UA pool of diverse PH patients, large PH referral base, comprehensive UA BioBank initiative, and prior experience with these phenotyping tools, all serve to increase the feasibility of our novel sub-phenotyping strategy focusing on Latinos with PH. These highly translational studies will generate novel category-specific biomarkers in this devastating pulmonary vascular disease and hold promise for a) identifying groups at high-risk for development of PH, b) personalizing PH therapies (combination therapy, transplant or surgical referral), and c) providing the rationale for novel PH classification paradigms."
"9318526","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An estimated 11% of women and 5% of men suffer from symptoms related to interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS), which generates a minimum $20 billion in direct medical costs annually in the United States. Approximately 17-40% of IC/PBS patients exhibit symptoms of a secondary chronic pelvic pain disorder and up to half suffer from depression and/or panic disorder. Comorbidity of syndromes has been associated with altered functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which regulates stress response and influences the perception of pain. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is the principal initiator of the stress response and, along with the related urocortis (Ucn), mediates downstream stress responses, as well as influences both positive and negative feedback onto the HPA axis. CRF is also a potent stimulator of peripheral mast cell degranulation and functions as a neuropeptide involved in regulating the central micturition reflex. Early life stress or trauma is a significant risk factor for HPA axis disruption and significantly increases the likelihood of developing chronic pelvic pain and mood disorders during adolescence or adulthood. Rodent models of neonatal stress display disruption of proper feedback onto the HPA axis, resulting in anhedonia, anxiety-like behaviors, and hyperalgesia and neurogenic inflammation in the pelvic viscera. Voluntary exercise has been shown to reverse many abnormalities associated with early life stress, including symptoms associated with chronic pain and mood disorders. The goal of the current proposal is to understand how manipulation of the limbic regulation and downstream output of the HPA axis affects both behavior and urogenital sensitivity in mice that were exposed to early life stress. Our central hypothesis is that comorbid urogenital pain syndromes and mood disorders in NMS mice arise from increased output of the HPA axis, due to diminished negative regulatory input from the hippocampus, and can be differentially attenuated by peripherally- and centrally-mediated interventions. We have designed three specific aims (SAs) to test this hypothesis. SA1 will determine how NMS alters the expression patterns and downstream peripheral influences of CRF-responsive brain regions. SA2 will determine the impact of mast cell activation on urogenital sensitivity and micturition in NMS mice. SA3 will determine the impact of voluntary exercise on improving hippocampal regulatory input onto the HPA axis in NMS mice. At the completion of this project, we will have gained novel insight on the mechanisms underlying comorbid pelvic pain and mood disorders following early life stress. We will also have obtained preclinical evidence on the efficacy of exercise, an easily translatable intervention, as a potentil treatment strategy for these debilitating disorders."

Of note, the P and F Program will embrace and support high impact studies in diverse populations with disproportionately high diabetes burdens. The P and F Program is a center-wide activity designed to support investigators in conducting studies that address the priority focal areas of GDTRC's Translation Research Cores: Design and Evaluation of patient- centered preventive and care services (Core B), Engagement and Behavior Change in high-risk communities (Core C), and Disparities due to a vast array of vulnerabilities (race/ethnic, gender, age, socioeconomic, co- morbidity, and geography)(Core D). The integration across GDTRC's Cores and the P and F Program ensures that pilot study investigators will be supported by Core Faculty ?nationally-recognized experts in their fields? in conducting innovative studies using state-of-the-art technologies, innovative design, and multi-disciplinary evaluation approaches. The P and F Program's main roles are: to serve as a funding catalyst (Aim 1), to support high-quality research through linkage to Faculty in GDTRC's Cores (Aim 2), and to help enhance productivity, visibility, and impacts of pilot grant recipients through offering dissemination skills training (Aim 3). These aims will be accomplished through innovative aspects of the Program: direct matching resource commitments (totaling $182,000 per annum) from GDTRC institutions to co-support pilot studies (e.g., Emory's Division of Geriatrics has committed $20,000 annually to co-support translation studies focused on the needs of older adults with diabetes); a Micro Grants program used successfully by Emory's Center for AIDS Research where small resources to support data collection or conference travel have resulted in a 43:1 return on investment; a multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional review group to oversee the P and F award selection; close connections with the Enrichment Program to co- host skills development modules for aspiring investigators; processes to link P and F applicants with Core Faculty; an innovative mentee-to-mentor program that involves mentoring pilot grant awardees to transition to mentoring others; and efficiently leveraging other NIH-funded programs (e.g., the Atlanta Clinical and Translation Science Institute's Biostatistics and Community Engagement Cores can provide statistical and community engagement methods guidance, respectively, to investigators developing pilot grants). Based on GDTRC's broad research base and rich history of engagement with communities, clinical centers, and local and federal health agencies in the region, P and F investigators ? whether from GDTRC or regional affiliates? will have access to some of the most understudied vulnerable populations, underused but impactful datasets, and some of the finest mentors in diabetes translation research."
"9315512","Project Summary: Bladder cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the U.S. Up to 80% of patients initially present with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) confined to the mucosa of the bladder. These patients are treated by tumor resection followed by intravesical chemotherapy or Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) therapy. Despite treatment, up to 60% of patients will experience tumor recurrence and, of these, about 50% will undergo radical cystectomy in an attempt to control disease progression and 30% of these patients will progress and succumb to their disease. Due to its high recurrence rate, NMIBC is the costliest of all cancers to treat. Since the FDA has not approved a drug for NMIBC in the last 20 years, novel therapies are desperately needed to prevent NMIBC disease progression and allow bladder preservation. T cells and natural killer (NK) cells have been implicated as critical mediators of the antitumor immune response using BCG therapy. Interleukin-15 (IL-15), considered by the NCI as the most promising immunotherapeutic that could potentially cure cancer, is a crucial factor for effector NK cell and CD8+ memory T cell stimulation and exhibits potent efficacy against tumors in various animal models. To advance IL-15-based therapies into clinical development, we have isolated a novel proprietary IL-15 superagonist mutant and associated it with an IL-15 receptor ??Fc fusion protein to generate a complex referred to as ALT-803. In numerous preclinical models, ALT-803 was shown to have improved pharmacokinetic, biodistribution and immunostimulatory properties and greater antitumor activity than IL-15 alone. We postulate that intravesical treatment of ALT-803 in combination with BCG will induce durable cell-mediated immune responses providing antitumor efficacy in patients with NMIBC. In clinically relevant rodent NMIBC tumor models, we found that intravesical ALT-803 + BCG therapy provided significantly better immune responses and antitumor activity than BCG monotherapy. Based on these results, a multicenter Phase 1/2 clinical trial of intravesical ALT-803 + BCG in NMIBC patients was initiated under the SBIR Phase II project and the dose escalation portion has now been successfully completed. The recommended Phase 2 dose of ALT-803 was established based on a safety profile comparable to BCG monotherapy. High-response rate with impressive durability (i.e., no disease recurrence at up to 18 months) and bladder localized immune cell activation were observed in all treated patients. These findings strongly support advancing to the randomized 2-arm dose expansion portion of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial as proposed in this Phase IIb application. In the Phase 2 study, NMIBC patients will receive intravesicular instillation of either ALT-803 + BCG or BCG alone and the disease-free response rate, duration of recurrence, and localized and systemic immune activation will be assessed. Improved clinical outcomes using ALT-803 + BCG would support a Phase 3 evaluation of intravesical ALT-803 therapy in patients with NMIBC with the ultimate goal of developing more durable or curative therapies in this indication."

CBS will also develop PGRR informational sessions  and also develop bioinformatics services to facilitate use. 4) Develop specialized databases for programs  such as UPCI Skin SPORE that integrate disparate clinical data sources, enabling integration of genomics  biomarker data with clinical phenotypes using the open source Informatics for Integrating Biology to the  Bedside (i2b2) platforms and related technologies. 5) Provide IT support for the Cancer Genomics Facility  (CGF) high performance computing needs, 6) Prepare data for publication including submitting data to the  Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and assist with manuscript preparation, and 7) Collaborate with the Health  Sciences Library System (HSLS) to evaluate bioinformatics tools for licensing and teach quarterly  bioinformatics courses to the user community. The goal of CBS is to provide cost effective and efficient  bioinformatics analysis services to the UPCI CCSG community. The current proposal focuses on expanding  these services as they are critical to the scientific discovery of new cancer biomarkers and therapeutic  targets. During that current project period all 10 Research Programs used CBS services."
"9397372","Project Summary  Despite the prevalence of the RyR in cardiac function, only a few therapies have been developed for the prevention and treatment of cardiac disease that target the ryanodine receptor (RyR). To determine whether or not such therapies might be developed from the isoryanodane framework, we propose to complete a total synthesis of the natural isoryanodanes perseanol and 18-hydroxyperseanol. Access to the isoryanodanes will position us to assess the ability of these diterpenes to bind to the RyR, specifically, through the preparation of unnatural isoryanodanes bearing the critical pyrrole-2-carboxylate ester.  Two highly convergent strategies aimed at efficiently establishing the polycyclic framework of these natural products are detailed. In the first strategy, a Heck cyclization/Stille cross-coupling cascade is proposed. The resulting allyl group serves as a handle to forge the 7- membered D-ring lactone in a two-step sequence involving a highly chemoselective Stahl aerobic oxidation. In the second strategy, a late-stage SmI2-mediated ketyl radical cyclization is envisioned to forge, at once, the C8?C9 bond and a critical all-carbon quaternary center. The development of an efficient and general approach will allow a comprehensive evaluation of these small molecules for the preparation of RyR isoform-selective molecular probes. The result of such a systematic approach will be the ability to rationally design small molecules for the treatment of cardiac disease. In doing so, we believe novel and potentially more effective cardiac treatments will be produced."
"9513765","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Mount Sinai Alzheimer Disease Research Center (MSADRC) continues its historic success in research by using its unprecedented resources and expertise to seize opportunities for innovative approaches to understand, treat, and ultimately prevent the earliest signs of cognitive loss due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other causes of dementia. We have conducted critical basic translational and clinical studies to characterize cognitive loss and dementia in the elderly. We have used the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) as a road map to focus our established strengths. We continue our commitment to therapeutic development with innovative and powerful systems biology approaches to establish networks that can identify new targets and select trial ready candidates through pharmacological repurposing and by using the novel opportunity offered by our role in the international stem cell consortium, to develop neural progenitors, approaches to find unique models for therapeutic targets. We will develop a trial ready registry of non- demented elders who are informed and eager to participate in prevention studies. We will expand our characterization of racially and ethnically diverse elders currently underrepresented in research, and ensure the opportunity for them to participate in clinical research fully, including genetic analysis, biomarker studies, and clinical trials. We will continue to collect brains from our well-characterized clinical populations and focus our efforts on the pathology associated with the transition from normal aging and cognitive impairment. Contributing to National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center resources with clinical, neuropathological, and neuroimaging data will be continued as well as our commitment to provide the National Cell Repository for AD with samples for every eligible participant in our cohort. In keeping with the recommendations of NAPA and the 2013 AD-Related Dementias Research Workshop to include in the study of AD- related disorders a specific focus on the contribution of vascular risks, we will build on our expertise by proposing 3 projects that focus on the intersection of type 2 diabetes (T2D) one of the most common comorbidities of the at risk age group of AD. In Project 1, we will characterize cognitive loss and dementia in T2D individuals, examining markers of AD and insulin resistance including inflammation and cerebrovascular disease to identify the individual contribution and interactive roles of each pathogenetic factor. Minority participation will be a major feature of ths project to assure that our findings are applicable to the most applicable and understudied individuals. In Project 2, our well-characterized participant cohorts and animal models will be used with stem cell technology to identify the contribution of insulin resistance through cell types. In project 3, we examine the effects of T2D and AD on angiogenesis and angiogenic complexes. Together these efforts are aimed at identifying targets for intervention and prevention of AD. The resources of the cores and opportunities of the projects support the multidisciplinary studies of the widest community of researchers in cognitive loss and dementia."
"9479337","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) affect 1%-2.5% of children worldwide. We suggest that etiological and genetic heterogeneity might converge in a few neurobiological downstream pathways. We have been investigating the pathobiology of ASD with large brain volume (macrocephaly), a phenotype which confers poorer prognosis. Ongoing studies have shown that telencephalic organoids differentiated in vitro from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) derived from patients with ASD and macrocephaly have increased cell proliferation, increased synaptic growth and overproduction of GABAergic inhibitory neurons, indicating an early imbalance in glutamate/GABA neuron ratio. RNA interference experiments suggested that the overproduction of GABAergic cells is attributable, at least in part, to an increase in expression of FOXG1, a master regulatory transcription factor crucial for telencephalic development. Major goals of this application are (1) to expand our analysis of the developmental pathways that are dysregulated in ASD to a larger number of families and (2) to understand to what extent developmental alterations we identified in ASD with macrocephaly also apply to ASD in general. To this end, we will obtain data on neurobiological measures, transcriptome and chromatin active regions in organoids derived from ASD patients with enlarged brain size and ASD patients with normal brain size. The altered gene regulatory network will be inferred and the two networks will be compared to understand similarities and differences in the two subgroups of ASD. To begin to understand the upstream causes of these developmental alterations, we will then investigate whether patients with ASD carry an increased burden of rare genomic variations in regions of the genome that participate in this regulatory network. Finally we will perform overexpression and RNAi knockdown experiments to examine the specific role of our current best candidate transcription factor, FOXG1, in the constellation of neurobiological and transcriptome alterations found in ASD-derived progenitors. We will assess the impact of perturbing FOXG1 gene expression on neurobiological functions (cell proliferation, glutamate/GABA neuron fate, synaptic growth), transcriptome and activity of transcription regulatory regions by RNA-seq and ChIP-seq, respectively, to gain insights into the role of a FOXG1-driven transcriptional program in the aberrant neuronal differentiation of ASD-derived neural progenitors. In summary, in this application we delineate strategies for (1) identifying gene networks and biological pathways that characterize altered development in two subgroups of ASD; (2) testing the causal role of one crucial node in such networks, the transcription factor FOXG1, which is over- active in ASD with macrocephaly; and (3) identifying regulatory factors, both genetic and epigenetic, upstream from neurobiological and gene expression abnormalities. The impact of these experiments will be the definition of a number of biological functions and molecular markers that are implicated in the neurobiology of ASD."
"9378073","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The diabetes rates for Asian Americans has been increasing over the last twenty years, with over 1 out of 5 Asian Americans having diabetes, almost twice the rates to their White counterparts (11.3%) (Lee et al., 2011; Menke, Casagrande, Geiss, & Cowie, 2015). The diabetes prevalence for Asians living in the U.S. are higher than those individuals living in their countries of origin (Fujimoto et al. 2012; Stewart 2016 et al.), and these vary widely by ethnic subgroup (Kanaya, 2010; Wang et al. 2011; Stewart et al 2016). We know little about what are the causes of these health disparities, and why the rates of the immigrants and the growing second generation are more at risk than in their respective Asian countries. Together, these observations suggest that assimilation, or the process of becoming American, may be putting immigrant minority groups, especially at risk for diabetes and other chronic diseases (Oza-Frank et al 2011; Popkin & Udry, 1998).  This mixed-method project examines the relationship between assimilation and diabetes prevalence in Asian American populations, using quantitative and qualitative approaches. Pooling data from years 2005- 2014 from the California Health Interview Survey, it examines the relationship between immigrant generation and type 2 diabetes, focusing on the top 6 Asian American ethnic groups in California. It also examines the extent acculturation and socioeconomic contextual factors might lead to differential risks for diabetes, while considering known risk factors. Partnering with the Los Angeles community-based organization, Asian Pacific Islanders Obesity Prevention Alliance (APIOPA), we supplement our quantitative findings with multilingual focus groups and interviews with Asian American from the different ethnic groups.  As one of the only research projects at our university to focus on Asian American health, the proposed project will provide a valuable opportunity for Asian American students to engage in research directly affecting their community as well as for other students with an interest in immigrant and minority health. Undergraduate and graduate students will be involved throughout the project including concept development, developing multicultural competent measures for quantitative data analysis, interview-guide construction, manuscript writing, and skills for community-engaged research."
"9410710","Abstract Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) holds great promise to reduce susceptibility to HIV infection for those who are HIV-negative and take PrEP regularly. However, PrEP initiation is serostatus dependent, and starting PrEP when risk emerges requires men who have sex with men (MSM) to maintain regular HIV testing routines and regularly assess PrEP eligibility. Currently many MSM do not test for HIV regularly, and PrEP uptake has been slow. PrEP will not have sufficient impact on HIV incidence among MSM unless it is brought to scale; PrEP coverage of 40-50% would be required to reduce HIV incidence by 25%. Today, PrEP uptake among MSM stands at 8.5%. We propose to test the efficacy of a mobile app (HealthMindr) to promote PrEP uptake in 3 US cities with substantial HIV epidemics among MSM: Atlanta, GA, Jackson, MS, and Washington, DC. The prevention app has already been developed and tested with 121 MSM; 9% of PrEP eligible MSM who used the app initiated PrEP during a 4-month follow-up period. Further, the app was found to be very acceptable to MSM. Minor enhancements to the PrEP component of the app will be made, including addition of additional PrEP information. The app will include components for self-administered risk assessments, developing and supporting a plan for frequent HIV testing, and monthly self-assessment for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) eligibility. The app will link those eligible for PrEP to services with a locator for PrEP providers, including private providers and details about services available, and with public PrEP navigators. The app will be tested in an RCT versus standard of care (referral to existing PrEP information and resources) in the three cities. The primary outcome will be rate of PrEP initiation, confirmed by tenofovir-diphosphate detection in a dried blood spot (DBS) specimen and/or photographic evidence of PrEP prescription."
"9298401","The long-term goal ofthe research program. Genetic Models for Precision Cancer Medicine (Drs. Bult, Dai, and McKeon co-Leaders), is to develop novel therapeutic and diagnostic concepts for cancer by modeling and interrogating the complex genomics of human cancers. Research is organized around three inter-related themes, all of which involve the systems genomics ofthe cancer cell and its host environment. The first theme. Cancer Cell Robustness, aims to define the dynamic genome alterations at a systems level that generate primary drug resistance in a cancer and its subclones. The second theme. Genetic and Genomic Complexity, aims to measure and quantify genomic instability in primary cancers; to describe the associated genomic configurations; and to use defective maintenance systems for genome integrity for therapeutic advantage. The third theme. Progenitor Cell Biology, aims to define the genomic parameters of certain cancer progenitors; to reconstruct cancer states in primary cells using systems approaches; and to use this knowledge to provide effective combinatorial therapeutics. All program goals rely on interactions with program members who are developing advanced cross cutting technological approaches. The first approach, precision model development, includes efficient methods for humanizing cancer-relevant genomic regions in the mouse; tool strains for directing and visualizing temporal and tissue-specific gene expression; optimized immunodeficient mice for sustained engraftment of primary human cancers; and populations of mice that model human genomic heterogeneity. The second approach, genomic technologies, develops new high throughput DNA interrogation methodologies for detailed assessment of structural and sequence mutations and their transcriptional consequences. The third key technology is computational, including algorithms for modeling gene networks; ontology development that supports data integration and enables in silico modeling of gene functional associations; and informatics and database systems are essential for integrative studies and comparative genomic analyses. The 47 program members include 35 at Bar Harbor, 8 at Farmington, and 1 at Sacramento, together with 3 adjunct members from UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center, Eastern Maine Healthcare Systems, and Trinity University (TX). Through its emphasis on basic research and unique technology development, the program leverages funding from multiple NIH ICs in support of cancer focused research. In total the program is supported by $40,150,131 total costs in NCI and other peer reviewed cancer-related support in the last budget year. Over the past grant cycle, program members produced 1022 publications, including 10% intra-programmatic collaborations and 62% with collaborators external to JAX"

"9387865","HDAC6, a new therapeutic target for chronic pain Chronic neuropathic pain is a severe medical condition and an important unmet medical need. Current first-line medications successfully provide relief in a subset of patients but their activity usually require weeks to months of administration a delay also observed in preclinical models. In contrast, recent preclinical studies show that broad-acting histone deceatylase (HDAC) inhibitors, such as trichostatin A (TSA) and Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), rapidly relieve hyperalgesia in various models of neuropathic pain. This points to HDAC inhibition as a promising avenue for the development of new treatments. However, the exact mechanisms underlying this rapid analgesic activity remain elusive. Characterizing the specific HDAC isoforms, the HDAC substrates, and brain networks that mediate these analgesic effects, will provide important insights for the design of newer medications with improved side-effect profile. Our preliminary data indicate that the selective pharmacological blockade of HDAC6, a mainly cytoplasmic class IIB isoform, is sufficient to fully recapitulate the analgesic activity of broad acting HDAC inhibitors, even though this isoform does not deacetylate chromatin in vivo. Under Aim I we will combine state of the art isoform-selective pharmacological probes and conditional loss of function of HDAC6 using a floxed HDAC6 allele to investigate the role of HDAC6 in pain- like behaviors associated with peripheral nerve injury. Specifically, we will use the spare nerve model of neuropathic pain to test the hypothesis that HDAC6 activity at certain supraspinal sites, such as the serotonergic Raphe Nuclei (RN), is necessary and sufficient for the development of sensory hypersensitivity and/or depression-like behaviors. Under Aim II, we will track changes in the expression and activity of HDAC6 at successive time-points after the induction of nerve injury. We will also monitor changes in the phosphorylation of HDAC6 and the acetylation of Hsp90 and alpha-tubulin, two validated targets of HDAC6, under neuropathic pain states. Finally, we will assess the impact of HDAC6 in cytokine expression in the RN."
"9333074","Project Summary The increasing clinical use of cannabinoids highlights the importance of developing a more complete understanding of cannabinoid pharmacokinetics and predicting potential drug-drug interactions of cannabinoids with other commonly prescribed medications. Following administration, cannabinoids including ?9- tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are metabolized and inactivated by cytochrome P450 enzymes primarily within the liver. These metabolic enzymes are solely located intracellularly, yet cannabinoids localize to cellular membranes as a result of their highly hydrophobic nature. A protein-mediated cytoplasmic transport mechanism must exist to shuttle cannabinoids into the cell for subsequent metabolism. Cannabinoid transport within hepatocytes remains poorly characterized, highlighting a major gap in our knowledge of phytocannabinoid inactivation. Identification of hepatic proteins that facilitate intracellular shuttling of exogenous cannabinoids would greatly enhance our knowledge of cannabinoid inactivation. The current proposal will test the hypothesis that hepatic fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) mediate phytocannabinoid metabolism by shuttling these lipophilic compounds to their intracellular metabolic enzymes for subsequent biotransformation and elimination. In addition to phytocannabinoids, hepatic FABPs bind to and transport numerous clinically used drugs and therefore present a potential new site of drug-drug interactions. The principal goal of this research project is to test the hypothesis that hepatic FABPs influence THC pharmacokinetics and consequently the magnitude and duration of THC effects. In the first aim, the role of FABP1 in THC metabolism will be explored in vitro, utilizing primary hepatocytes derived from wild-type and FABP1 knockout mice. The second aim will characterize differences in cannabinoid metabolism and efficacy between wild-type and FABP1 knock out mice. Metabolite production will be examined by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry while THC efficacy will be examined by real-time monitoring of physiological and behavioral THC effects. The outcome of this work will identify FABPs as novel regulators of cannabinoid metabolism and may serve to predict drug-drug interactions caused by competition for binding, and subsequent uptake, at the FABPs."
"9327022","Project Summary This R21 application proposes the development and pilot evaluation of a clinically-based, technology- augmented secondary prevention intervention for adolescent victims of cyber-bullying. Approximately 25% of adolescents (age 13-17) report past-year cyber-victimization. Cyber-victimization correlates with numerous negative long-term psychosocial effects, including suicidality, depression, and substance use. Pediatricians currently provide in-clinic preventive interventions to adolescents on a variety of topics. They have been encouraged to screen and counsel adolescents on cyber-victimization; however, no effective cyber- victimization prevention interventions exist for the clinical setting. Brief in-person interventions and longitudinal text-message interventions are acceptable, feasible, and effective at changing adolescent behaviors, including those related to occurrence of physical victimization. Drawing on prior work, this application proposes using a rigorous two-step process to develop an intervention consisting of a brief in-clinic cyber-victimization prevention session, followed by an eight-week tailored, two-way text-messaging program. The two-part intervention will focus on (a) enhancing participants' self-efficacy and resetting norms regarding cyber- victimization and (b) improving participants' emotional regulation and cognitive restructuring in the face of cyber-victimization. In Aim 1, the novel intervention will be developed based on social cognitive learning theory, prior work by the research team, semi-structured interviews with adolescents, and an iterative refinement process during a series of open pilot tests. In Aim 2, the feasibility and acceptability of the novel in- clinic + text-message intervention will be assessed through a pilot randomized controlled trial (n=50). Additionally, the study team will establish the feasibility of an innovative method for measuring cyber- victimization, downloading participants' anonymized social interactions directly from their phones using a previously-piloted computer program, and developing preliminary coding schemes to identify victimization. If the intervention is shown feasible and effective, this study is expected to inform a future large scale effectiveness study to embed a technology-augmented intervention in the clinical setting. The proposed intervention would have broad public health implications, giving clinicians a much-needed tool to reduce cyber- victimization and its consequences in adolescents, addressing both NICHD Vision Themes and critical adolescent objectives of Healthy People 2020."
"9369549","During the current outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV), there has been an increased association of ZIKV infections with microcephaly and other congenital neurological disorders prompting extensive efforts to develop antiviral strategies; however, none have thus far been approved for use in humans. The identification of host cellular factors required for virus replication may lead to novel therapeutic strategies. The host ubiquitin (Ub) system is a conserved cellular pathway important in many functions, including innate immune signaling and virus replication. The goal of this proposal is to define the molecular mechanisms of ZIKV replication involving the ubiquitin system, and identify host proviral factors that can be targeted for therapeutic intervention.  The envelope (E) protein of flaviviruses is essential for virus replication because it mediates attachment to host cell receptors, thereby promoting virus internalization. Further, the E protein may also confer specific cellular tropism by recognizing host factors expressed by specific cell types. Although the E proteins of closely related flaviviruses, like dengue virus (DENV), are well characterized, little is known about ZIKV-E function, and whether host cellular factors are linked to the characteristic neurological disorders observed during ZIKV infections is unknown. There is a major gap in knowledge regarding how ZIKV establishes productive infections in its host and whether it uses the ubiquitin system for replication. Because of its critical function in virus internalization, the E protein has been proposed as a target for therapeutic intervention. Therefore, the identification of host cellular factors required for virus replication by regulating E protein function may provide novel antiviral targets.  Our preliminary data indicate that the ZIKV-E protein is ubiquitinated by TRIM7, a member of the E3-Ub ligase tripartite motif (TRIM) family. Knockdown of TRIM7 resulted in reduced ubiquitination of E, which correlated with reduced ZIKV replication in placenta-derived cell lines, suggesting that TRIM7 has a proviral function by ubiquitinating E. TRIM7 is highly expressed in placenta and reproductive tissues, two important sites of ZIKV replication. Therefore, our hypothesis is that the envelope protein of ZIKV is ubiquitinated by TRIM7 to promote ZIKV replication within specific sites of the host. By using in vitro biochemical approaches, recombinant ZIKV mutant viruses, and an in vivo mouse model, we will determine whether ubiquitination of E is important for ZIKV tropism and reveal how TRIM7 contributes to ZIKV replication. We propose the following specific aims: 1) Determine the role of ubiquitination of the ZIKV envelope protein in virus replication and 2) Determine the molecular mechanism by which TRIM7 regulates ZIKV replication. The outcome of these studies is significant because it will provide fundamental knowledge about the mechanism of ZIKV replication, which may apply to other members of the Flaviviridae family. This work also identifies a host cellular factor, TRIM7, that can potentially be targeted as a novel therapeutic strategy."
"9280927","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for a K23 Mentored Research Career Development Award for Dr. James Chen, an Assistant Professor and Orthodontist at UCSF. Dr. Chen is working to establish his research on early interceptive orthodontic treatment for socially disadvantaged children and his clinical expertise. This application is designed to provide the necessary mentoring, training, and research support Dr. Chen needs to become a successful independent investigator. Specifically, this award sets out to accomplish the following goals: (1) become an expert in patient-based early interceptive orthodontic treatment research; (2) to determine the equivalence in treatment outcome and child self-perception between a removable-appliance-based protocol and a fixed-appliance-based protocol; (3) to learn and implement advanced biostatistical methods in clinical research; (4) to learn and implement cost-effectiveness analysis models on early interceptive orthodontic treatment protocols; (5) to develop and grow a strong independent clinical research career; (6) to be a leader in access to orthodontic health care in the United States. In order for Dr. Chen to achieve these goals he will need support to design and implement his study. Dr. Chen has assembled a diverse mentoring team comprised of a primary mentor, Dr. George Taylor, who is the Department Chair of Preventive and Restorative Sciences and conducts public-health-related research on diabetes and periodontitis, and three co-mentors with one consultant: Dr. Greg Huang, Chair of Orthodontics at the University of Washington, who is an expert on evidenced based orthodontic research; Dr. James Kahn, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology in Medicine at UCSF, who is an expert on cost-effectiveness analysis and health care economics; Dr. Jing Cheng, Associate Professor in the School of Dentistry, who is an expert on study design and biostatistical analysis; and Dr. Gerald Nelson, Acting Chair of Division of Orthodontics at UCSF, will serve as a clinical consultant because of his extensive knowledge and experience with early interceptive orthodontic treatment. Oral health disparities and access to orthodontic care for socially disadvantaged children is a major concern in the United States. Dr. Chen's research will focus on critically analyzing a novel removable appliance based treatment protocol aimed at reducing orthodontic need while limiting the financial impact on low-income families compared to the existing fixed appliance based treatment protocol. The hypothesis of this study is that a treatment protocol based on using removable appliances provides the same treatment outcome but better cost-effectiveness than a traditional fixed-appliance protocol. The crux of this study will include comparing the differences in treatment outcome (AIM 1), measured by occlusal index scores (PAR Index and ICON Index), the differences in child self-perception measured by Child Perception Questionnaire (AIM 2) after orthodontic treatment, and the difference in cost-effectiveness (AIM 3) between the removable appliance only group and the fixed appliances only group. For all three aims, Dr. Chen will recruit participants beginning early interceptive orthodontic treatment at La Clinica Community Clinic and UCSF Orthodontic Residency Clinic and he will follow them to completion of their orthodontic treatment and then progression into full permanent dentition. This study will require sophisticated multiple linear regression analyses. This research will be the starting point for developing and initiating a large intervention trial comparing removable based appliance therapy to fixed appliance based therapy for socially disadvantaged children. Towards the end of this K23 award Dr. Chen will prepare and apply for a R34 award to develop the intervention trial followed by an application for an U01 clinical trial award."
"9382357","ABSTRACT Many diseases including Alzheimer's, cardiac arrhythmias, and multiple metastatic cancers exhibit dysregulated intercellular Ca2+ transients (ICTs). Calcium ions (Ca2+) serve as critical second messengers involved in cell signaling and in coordinating proper organ development. Ca2+ is also important in the transduction of mechanical forces in tissues and for integrating multiple biochemical signals from diffusible proteins termed morphogens. Both morphogen signaling and mechanical force inputs have been implicated in the size control and patterning of developing organs. However, much is still unknown about the regulation and functions of ICTs during tissue growth and regeneration. For example, it has been known for some time that a left-right asymmetry in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations exists during vertebrate development; however, the exact mechanism governing this observed asymmetry remains unclear. The overall goal of the research program is to identify the underlying principles and mechanisms that govern the coordination of cellular processes during growth and regeneration with a particular emphasis on understanding the regulation and functions of ICTs. Our lab is at the forefront of developing multi-disciplinary approaches to define the interplay between ICTs, morphogen signaling, and mechanical forces during tissue growth and regeneration. We have recently discovered anterior-posterior patterning of ICTs in developing Drosophila (fruit fly) wing discs. We have identified that genetic disruption of the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway, which directs patterning of the anterior- posterior axis in the wing primordium, abolishes this observed asymmetry of ICTs. This establishes a fundamental link between morphogen signaling and ICTs in a developmental context. We are now currently focused on bridging the large gap between descriptive observations and systems-level quantitative analysis of ICTs. We are studying the impact of ICTs on morphogen signaling, organ development, and regeneration by modulating ICTs and morphogen activity both genetically and pharmacologically in Drosophila wing discs. Further, we are capturing dynamic and multi-scale measurements of ICTs to characterize modulators of Ca2+. We are also developing computational models to test hypothesized cross-talk between morphogenetic signaling and Ca2+ signaling dynamics. Cumulatively, this research will result in novel quantitative imaging approaches to map ICTs to morphogenetic patterning in developing and regenerating tissues. A mechanistic understanding of ICT regulation and function will lead to critical insights into how tissues grow and regenerate. This fundamental understanding also will allow us to understand and mitigate unwanted side effects of targeting Ca2+ signaling therapeutically and will potentially reveal innovative strategies for accelerating tissue regeneration."

The specific aims of IDS are to 1) Review protocols (pre-approval process), assist with protocol  implementation, and coordinate drug management and investigational drug supply; 2) Make clinical  recommendations for drug therapy, provide dose calculations and monitoring plans, and manage adverse  events; 3) Assist in writing medication administration and delivery section of protocols; and 4) Provide  experiential education opportunities for clinical pharmacists in training at the University of Pittsburgh and  Duquesne University. The goal of the IDS is to ensure that the procurement, receipt, storage, accountability,  preparation, dispensing, labeling, and shipping of investigational agents are performed in accordance with all  state and federal laws. Clinical recommendations for drug therapy, monitoring plans for a treatment regimen,  managing adverse events, and dose calculations are performed with respect to the treatment of patients who  have agreed to participate in a clinical research protocol. Moreover, the IDS works with physicians, nurses, and  other clinical research personnel in order to provide optimal care for patients with cancer. The IDS pharmacy  employs two pharmacists and one pharmacy technician. In addition to the IDS personnel, the UPMC  Shadyside-Hillman Cancer Center Clinic Pharmacy works with the IDS and has ten full-time pharmacy  technicians, twelve full-time pharmacists, and 2 part-time pharmacists. These individuals assist in treating  patients enrolled in protocol treatments mainly through checking eligibility for the trials and treatments, entering  chemotherapy orders, and mixing chemotherapy. The IDS reviews all approved IRB protocols, standard  chemotherapy and protocol regimens, supportive care regimens (antiemetics and other premedications), and  investigational drug policies and procedures. The IDS pharmacy prepares, labels, and dispenses all  investigational medications and maintains accurate and complete drug accountability records for all  investigational agents. For oral agents, an IDS pharmacist counsels each patient receiving an investigational  drug dispensed for home administration at the Hillman Cancer Center. This process occurs with the first  dispense, along with any dose changes (dose reduction or dose escalation). Throughout the entire network,  the IDS provides oversight and monitoring for all clinical trial related activities. In the current project period  members of six UPCI Research Programs used IDS."
"9540401","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed Oregon Health and Science University R25 program (Translational Training in Biomedical Imaging Research) will provide an immersive training experience for selected residents in the methodology and performance of biomedical imaging research for one year during residency, after which participants will enter an innovative two year clinical fellowship program at OHSU with protected academic time (20-40%) dedicated to research. Team mentoring will be provided by drawing together experienced research supervisors from faculty members in radiology, other clinical specialties, and basic sciences. These teams will comprise an experienced and expert group of research scientists engaged in the development and applications of a comprehensive array of imaging methods for biomedical applications. While the program is linked to a novel six year structure of combined residency and fellowship, which aligns with ongoing changes in the American Board of Radiology exam structure and the current tough radiology job market, only the dedicated research year will be funded by R25 funds. We plan to take promising young trainees and jumpstart their academic careers by providing them with a multidisciplinary and mentored research exposure early in their training, with the broad long term goal of improving imaging detection, monitoring, and treatment of disease by producing a cadre of physicians who will become independent clinical scientific investigators and future leaders in academic biomedical imaging. That is, the overarching purpose of the program is to produce skilled academic radiologists by providing a facilitated transition between residency/fellowship and academic faculty positions in Radiology. Such individuals are crucial for the continued evolution of biomedical imaging. Radiologists are uniquely positioned to be the cornerstone in multidisciplinary biomedical research, but they can only fulfill this role if adequately trained, prepared, and skilled in building and developing interdisciplinary teams. In addition, we plan to give special attention to the recruitment and training of residents from under-represented minorities or with disabilities or other social, cultural, economic, or educational disadvantages, since OHSU recognizes the importance of diversity in enriching the institutional culture and fulfilling the wider-ranging mission of the campus. A relatively broad theme has been deliberately chosen for this program, so trainees can pursue any of a wide and flexible range of research options within the multiple areas encompassed by biomedical imaging. A broad theme also capitalizes on one of the core strengths of our institution, namely, the breadth and diversity of the research activities and interests at OHSU and the wide spectrum of available imaging facilities and resources. A common core training block of coursework in research methodology, biostatistics, and biomedical imaging tools will provide those entering the training program with a shared foundation of knowledge. Trainees are mentored in the ethics and methods of biomedical research, as well as in grant writing and other important career skills."
"9285649","Multi-feature modeling of the neural representation of emotion- and identity-related information derived from facial and vocal cues. People signal their internal emotional state by a range of cues including facial expressions, non-verbal vocalizations and the tone and content of speech. Much work to date on emotional signaling has focused on a small number of emotions and has relied on stimulus sets with limited numbers of exemplars and poor representation of individuals of different ages and ethnicities. The computer vision literature has long recognized the need to be able to compare models, for example of face recognition, across complex, diverse, and naturalistic stimulus sets. Here, we argue that a parallel approach needs to be applied if we are to achieve a robust and generalizable understanding of how the human brain represents emotion and identity related information derived from facial and vocal cues. Three multi-session functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments are proposed. In the first, participants will view a large corpus (~2000) of faces of individuals varying in age, gender and ethnicity and showing a wide range of emotional expressions. In the second, participants will be presented with a large (~1000) and equally diverse set of emotional vocalizations. The third experiment will make use of an even more complex and naturalistic stimulus set comprising ~1000 video clips of individuals expressing emotions through facial expression, non-verbal vocalizations and emotion-laden speech. This set will be broken into three parts, with as closely matched content as possible. These will be presented to participants in audio only, visual only and audio-visual (bimodal) conditions, with the stimuli allocated to each condition balanced across participants. For each experiment, data collection will comprise separate Model Estimation and Model Validation periods with the majority of stimuli presented at Validation being distinct from those presented at Estimation. A range of models will be fit to the fMRI data acquired during Estimation runs and tested and compared using data acquired during Validation runs. These models contain sets of features that describe the emotional content of the stimuli presented in terms of either dimensional or categorical models of emotion. By comparing the fit of these models we can determine which models capture most variance in voxel response profiles and examine how this varies across brain regions. Across the three experiments, we also seek to establish whether there are regions where voxels show common coding of emotional state regardless of whether information is carried by facial or vocal cues or a combination of both. Further, by contrasting models with and without terms for characteristics such as age, gender and ethnicity we can also investigate the (in)dependence of the representation of emotion and identity-related features. The proposed research has the potential to greatly advance our understanding of how cues to others' emotional state are represented in the human brain and the extent to which this is influenced by the characteristics of the person we are interacting with. In the medium term, we plan to extend this to also model listener/ viewer characteristics (both demographics and predisposition to anxiety or depression) in a hope to advance our understanding of how biases in the interpretation of emotional signals can arise."
"9367361","PROJECT SUMMARY Substance use disorders disproportionately affect individuals seeking treatment in Emergency Departments (EDs). Nicotine addiction is a commonly reported substance use disorder in ED populations that impacts adults directly and their children through secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe). EDs are uniquely positioned to deliver preventive intervention for tobacco use disorders to at-risk adult and child populations with limited access to sources of preventive care. While EDs could expand medical care to include a focus on health promotion and disease prevention for children and their caregivers, implementation of such efforts is rare. Commonly reported barriers include time, resources, and skill in public health intervention. Thus, there is a call to train scientists capable of leading multi-disciplinary research that extends the clinical mission of EDs to include health promotion and disease prevention efforts. However, little attention has been given to quantifying the contribution child SHSe has on pediatric ED (PED) utilization and exploring how to effectively implement SHSe reduction interventions into this opportune setting. Therefore, the specific aims of this project are: 1) To determine the contribution that child SHSe has on healthcare utilization and related costs in SHS-exposed children who present to the PED compared with unexposed children; 2) To select one of two existing, evidence-based SHSe reduction interventions, and identify ways to adapt and successfully implement the intervention in the PED setting by conducting focused interviews with physicians, nurses, social workers, and healthcare administrators; and 3) To develop an implementation plan and corresponding manual of procedures for use in a future R01 SHSe reduction intervention that will be adapted for the PED setting. The successful completion of the proposed project will result in identification of the health and economic burden of child SHSe on the PED and creation of an implementation plan to reduce SHSe to be tested in a future R01 trial. Dr. Ashley L. Merianos, the candidate, is an Assistant Professor at the University of Cincinnati. The National Institutes of Health Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) will provide the candidate with fundamental research and career training in mixed-methods methodology and preventive intervention to implement the proposed work. Dr. Merianos? long-term career goal is to be a health services researcher with expertise in developing, adapting, and implementing evidence-based behavioral interventions for substance use disorders affecting children in the acute healthcare setting. Through the proposed K01 work, she plans to focus on child SHSe in the PED to acquire new skills needed to incorporate health promotion and disease prevention into the acute healthcare setting."
"9472442","Project Summary NIA has established the National Institute on Aging Genetics of Alzheimer's Disease Data Storage Site (NIAGADS) as a national genetics data repository in order to facilitate access by qualified investigators to genotypic data for the study of the genetics of late-onset Alzheimer's Disease (AD). It is the policy of the NIA that all Genetic Data derived from NIA funded studies for the genetics of late-onset Alzheimer's disease be deposited at NIAGADS or another NIA approved site or both whenever possible. NIAGADS is also the Data Coordinating Center for Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP), a White House/NIH initiative to identify new genetic variants by sequencing genomes/exomes of ~15,000 AD patients and cognitively normal controls. In the second funding period, NIAGADS will continue its mission as the national repository for AD genetics with these proposed activities: (1) receive and organize AD genetics datasets for community access, (2) coordinate data production and support analysis activities for ADSP, (3) develop the AD Genomics Information Gateway (AD-GIG), an integrated information platform for researchers to access AD knowledge, data, and other resources at NIAGADS more easily, (4) expand NIAGADS resource by interfacing with other research initiatives, and (5) promote community involvement with an active outreach program."
"9214309","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Endochondral ossification is the major process of embryonic skeletal development and longitudinal bone growth. During this process chondrocytes within each skeletal element become organized into growth plates and undergo maturation and hypertrophy. Following hypertrophy, the cells reach a final late-hypertrophic stage during which they facilitate cartilage matrix remodeling and mineralization and invasion of blood vessels, leading to replacement of calcified cartilage by bone. This sequence of phenotypic changes requires tight control by numerous systemic and local factors, and alterations of such regulatory mechanisms underlie congenital and acquired skeletal pathologies. The retinoic acid receptors ?, ? and ? (RAR?, RAR? and RAR?) are nuclear hormone receptors that regulate fundamental biological processes. During the previous funding cycle, we studied the roles of RAR signaling in growth plate function and found that (1) RAR? is the dominant receptor in growth plate; (2) expression of RAR? enhances aggrecan production in cultured chondrocytes under retinoid-free condition; (3) RAR? mRNA is predominantly localized in proliferative and prehypertrophic zones but the active form of retinoic acid (atRA) is hardly detectable in these zones; and (4) RAR? deficiency induces skeletal growth retardation. These findings led us to conclude that RAR? exerts an essential role in cartilage matrix production as a ligand-less transcriptional repressor in growth plate. Surprisingly, immuno- histochemical analysis of RAR? revealed that RAR? protein was localized to the hypertrophic zone where atRA was present, indicating that ligand-bound RAR? acts on hypertrophic chondrocytes. We found also that selective RAR? agonists markedly stimulated gene expression levels linked to late-hypertrophic function in cultured primary chondrocytes and that administration of RAR? agonist accelerated chondrocyte hypertrophy and caused growth-plate closure in mouse. These and other findings lead to our central hypothesis that ligand-bound RAR? in hypertrophic zone stimulates late-hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes and endochondral ossification and that modulations of RAR? pathway could have therapeutic value. Our specific goals are (1) To define the role of RAR? in regulation of late-hypertrophic differentiation of growth plate chondrocytes and transition from cartilage to bone; (2) To determine the molecular mechanisms by which RAR? regulates late-hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes; and (3) To examine the role of RAR? in pathological growth-arrest of long bones and test if selective inhibition of RAR? ameliorates the condition. We will modify RAR? signaling in hypertrophic chondrocytes by use of genetically modified mouse systems and/or pharmacological manipulations and clarify physiological importance of RAR? in growth plate. The results could also provide a new avenue to therapy for precocious growth plate closure and arrest of bone growth which is not currently available for most cases."

"9409483","Project Summary/Abstract  Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) is a retrovirus that infects CD4+ T cells of the immune system. If left untreated, HIV-1 infected individuals will progress to AIDS and may ultimately die as a result. Combination antiretroviral therapy is extremely effective at stopping the replication of HIV-1 in infected individuals. Despite the success of this therapy at suppressing HIV-1 replication to clinically undetectable levels, antiretroviral therapy is not curative. This is due to the persistence of HIV-1 in a silent, or latent, state within a subset of CD4+ T cells known as resting memory CD4+ T cells. In this latent state, these infected cells are not targeted by antiretroviral drugs and cannot be eliminated by the immune system. In HIV-1 infected individuals, latently infected CD4+ T cells are found at extremely low frequencies (~1 per million resting memory CD4+ T cells). However, this population of latently infected cells is very stable, demanding that HIV-1 infected individuals remain on antiretroviral therapy indefinitely. Therefore, this population of latently infected CD4+ T cells is the main barrier to curing HIV-1 infection.  Developing strategies to eliminate latently infected cells is a major focus of the NIH, NIAID, and the HIV-1 research field. One primary strategy involves the reactivation of latent infected cells, driving their elimination. We need sensitive, validated molecular assays to monitor this reactivation of latently infected cells in patients receiving such therapeutics. The most direct way to quantify reactivation is to measure the induction of intracellular HIV-1 mRNA, yet current methods suffer from critical shortcomings.  Accelevir Diagnostics, LLC is developing a new quantitative assay to measure intracellular HIV-1 mRNA in infected patients. Importantly, this assay will cover globally distributed HIV-1 subtypes. Broadly, this proposal aims to optimize the assay, perform key assay validation studies, and define baseline intracellular HIV-1 mRNA values for ART- suppressed individuals. The goal of this proposal is to develop an optimized commercial prototype, with accompanying standard operating procedures, and set the stage for rapid analytical validation and market entry. !"

"9315617","The UC Davis MIND Institute IDDRC proposes a Research Project relevant to the Multi-modal  Treatment Approaches theme that spans basic and clinical science and utilizes five of the proposed cores.  Recent advances in the neurobiology of fragile X syndrome (FXS) have led to targeted treatments that rescue  many phenotypic features in the FMRI knock out (KO) mouse and other animal models (Berry-Kravis et al.,  2011; Bhakar et al., 2012; Hagerman et al., 2012). Many of these treatments are based on the mGluRS  (metabotropic glutamate receptor 5) theory of FXS, which proposes that absence or reduction of FMRP in the  full mutation leads to hypersensitivity of the mGluRS pathway to glutamate, which causes intellectual  impairments, seizures, and other features of FXS (Bear et al., 2004; Dolen et al., 2007; Huber et al., 2002;  Osterweil et al., 2010). In fact, mGluRS antagonists have proven effective in rescuing several FXS-related  phenotypes in rodents (Dolen et al., 2010). In contrast to animal studies, therapeutic approaches targeting  mGluRS show only modest efficacy in humans (Berry-Kravis et al., 2012). Three factors have contributed to the  human findings, (a) Multiple pathways are affected in FXS; thus, targeting only a single pathway is unlikely to  fully correct the complex phenotype. Additional targets must be identified so that a polypharmaceutical  approach can be developed, (b) The outcome measures used in many clinical trials are not adequate for  detecting subtle but meaningful treatment effects. (3) Important treatment-induced changes in brain function  may produce only modest short-term changes in observable behavior in individuals with FXS, who have a  history of missed and non-normative learning opportunities prior to treatment. It may be possible, however, to  boost the phenotypic effects of a drug by adding a behavioral intervention to take advantage of improved  brain function."
"9222886","ABSTRACT With the career goal of becoming an independent investigator, Dr. Marcus Bachhuber describes a mentored research project and a rigorous career development plan which will prepare him to study the implementation and testing of interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality from substance use. Prescriptions for opioid analgesics have increased dramatically and, in parallel, downstream consequences such as nonmedical use, opioid use disorders, and overdose have also increased. While most research focuses on opioid analgesics for chronic pain, the use of these medications for acute pain is also associated with a risk of adverse events such as overdose. Furthermore, up to three-quarters of people receiving an opioid analgesic prescription have leftover pills, which are often accidentally ingested (e.g., by children) or diverted for nonmedical use. Our project seeks to reduce harms from opioid analgesics used for acute non-cancer pain by reducing the quantity prescribed. The use of prescription defaults (i.e., a default number of pills for every new prescription) in the electronic health record (EHR) has the potential to change provider behavior, but has not been rigorously studied for opioid analgesics. This research centers on the implementation of default quantities for all new opioid analgesic prescriptions in the EHR, termed e-DROP (Electronic Defaults to Reduce Opioid Prescribing). In a cluster-randomized trial, we anticipate randomizing 27 primary care and 4 ED sites (over 900 providers writing in excess of 19,000 opioid analgesic prescriptions annually) to either e-DROP or the usual EHR. This proposal aims to: 1) Determine the impact of e-DROP on the quantity of opioid analgesics prescribed (primary outcome) as well as subsequent medication reorders and health care visits (secondary outcomes); 2) Examine the impact of e-DROP on patient-reported outcomes such as pain (primary outcome), leftover opioid analgesic pills, and satisfaction (secondary outcomes); 3) Determine provider factors associated with prescribing the default number of pills or fewer; and 4) Determine the effect of e-DROP on total direct health care costs. To accomplish these aims, Dr. Bachhuber will pursue training in implementation science, randomized controlled trial design and conduct, cost analysis of randomized trials, and advanced longitudinal data analysis. With completion of these activities, along with intensive mentorship, Dr. Bachhuber will develop the skills necessary to achieve his career goal of becoming an independent investigator."

"9346089","Advancing Genomics Of Recessive Ataxias Project summary Hereditary spastic paraplegias have a heterogeneous genetic etiology. While ~50% of all patients of dominant HSP are explained by three major genes (spastin, atlastin, REEP1), the remaining genetic causes are rare and explain no more then another 15% of patients. For recessive HSP only about 40-50% of patients receive a genetic diagnosis. Recent progress is tremendous and will likely identify the genetic basis for another 20% of patients in the coming five years. Especially interesting is that less than 50% of cases are clarified in select exome sequencing approaches, implaying that whole genome studies will be necessary. In addition, HSPs often show clinical overlap with related neurological diseases, such as ataxias, leukodystrophies, metabolic disorders, and mitochondrial disorders. Thus, there is a two-fold need: 1) to standardize the clinical classification in a collaborative fashion and 2) to expand the knowledge of underlying causative genes and molecular pathways. This will be beneficial beyond HSP and contribute to our understanding of a number of related neurological diseases. For this study, we will create a collaborative structure between investigators in the USA, Germany, France, Belgium, Brazil, Austarlia, and indirectly Middle East and Northern Africa. We will be able to systematically study THE largest clinical sample of HSP in the world led by world-renowned clinical and genetic experts. Importantly, existing genomic data will be contributed in kind by our collaborators and jointly used in the analysis. Our recent success in identifying dozens of genes for familial neurological disorders, including HSP validates the suggested approach. Data will be shared with dbGAP. We expect to identify and publish 2 ? 4 novel genes per year and create a lasting resource of clinical and genomic data."
"9533763","?    DESCRIPTION: The objective of this proposal is to develop electrochemical biosensors capable of providing continuous real-time therapeutic drug monitoring with unprecedented chemical specificity and temporal resolution. The ability to provide real-time information about an individual's response to therapeutics has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by offering personalized treatment. Drugs with narrow therapeutic windows become toxic or ineffective if over- or under-dosed. Maintaining the most efficient dosage, personalized to the patient, can reduce toxicity, maximize efficacy of treatment, and ultimately improve patient outcome. Unfortunately, current methodologies for monitoring therapeutics are cumbersome (requiring tens of minutes to hours) and are performed removed from the point of care precluding real-time feedback. Biosensors represent a promising alternative but often fail to respond to specific targets when challenged in biological sample matrices. This failure is a result of biofouling, which masks the true sensor response. Here, we aim to leverage state-of-the-art bioanalytical science with biocompatible material (hydrogel) engineering to develop hybrid sensors capable of real-time continuous therapeutic drug monitoring in vivo. The specific goal is to couple the biocompatibility of hydrogel membranes with the rapid, selective, and specific recognition capabilities of electrochemical, aptamer-based (E-AB) sensors. The aims of the proposal are to first establish fundamental and universal sensor design and biomaterial engineering guidelines followed by the translation of the sensor to commercially engineered in vivo probes for multi- analyte detection. The short-term goal is to develop sensors for the real-time monitoring of the antibiotic tobramycin used for treatment of cystic fibrosis pulmonary exacerbations. In the long-term, combining the sensor development expertise of the PI and the biomaterial engineering expertise of the Co-PI, the general sensors developed here will be adapted to interface with a variety of biological interfaces including tissue and neuronal systems."
"9384942","As our population ages, the incidence of Type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) continues to rise, nearly doubling from the age of 45 to 65. T2DM is characterized by both hyperinsulinemia and hyperglucagonemia. The majority of research in the metabolic field has focused on the hyperinsulinemia that is characteristic of this disease. However, inhibition of glucagon action is highly effective in treating T2DM. In fact, metformin, the most prescribed anti-diabetic drug, activates AMP Kinase (AMPK) to inhibit hepatic glucagon signaling and limit hepatic glucose production in T2DM. Similar to the metabolic field, research focused on the accelerated aging in T2DM has primarily examined the role of hyperinsulinemia. Interventions and genetic models which decrease insulin signaling enhance lifespan, alter energy metabolism, and decrease age-related diseases in the mouse. Despite the hyperglycemia of T2DM and essential role of glucagon receptor signaling in the long-term survival of the lean aging mouse, we lack knowledge of the role glucagon plays in the accelerated aging of obesity or the slowed aging resulting from calorie restriction (CR). The widespread use and development of new therapeutics that inhibit glucagon signaling to treat T2DM demand studies focused on the role of glucagon signaling in healthy aging. I propose 3 aims focused on the role of global, hepatocyte, and adipocyte glucagon signaling in metabolic control and progression of aging in lean, obese, and calorie restricted mice. The studies proposed in this grant will be the first that investigate the role of glucagon signaling in healthspan, assess the response to elimination of glucagon signaling in either the adipocyte or hepatocyte, and address the potential for alternative responses to glucagon signaling inhibition in obesity, normal weight, and calorie restriction."
"9380634","Project Summary/ Abstract Female surgical sterilization is the second most commonly used contraceptive method in the US and is disproportionately used by low-income women and women of color. Whether the higher use of sterilization in these populations reflects inappropriate overutilization is unclear. On one hand, low-income and racial minority women frequently misunderstand the permanent nature of sterilization, are often unaware of reversible contraceptive alternatives, and commonly experience regret after the procedure? suggesting suboptimal decision making. On the other hand, there is evidence of substantial unmet demand for sterilization among low-income women, due to unique access barriers posed by Medicaid sterilization regulations, putting them at high risk for unintended pregnancy and the adverse health and social consequences associated with unintended pregnancy. Medicaid sterilization policy currently requires that all women requesting a federally-funded procedure complete a standardized consent form at least 30 days prior to sterilization. This policy was originally instituted in the 1970s to protect vulnerable women from coercive sterilization practices by attempting to ensure informed and voluntary consent. However, there is growing consensus that the policy is incapable of ensuring informed consent, and that the mandatory 30-waiting period impedes access to desired sterilization for many low-income women. The lack of a process that can ensure both informed consent and timely access for sterilization procedures hampers progress toward reproductive health equity for low-income women. The proposed project seeks to build and test a novel, web-based decision support tool to optimize low-income women's ability to make informed and value-concordant decisions about surgical sterilization. A decision support tool may be particularly useful in the context of sterilization decisions because this is a preference- sensitive decision with permanent implications and because there is a high level of misunderstanding about sterilization and limited awareness of alternative options among women who have undergone the surgery, indicating critical gaps in the quality of pre-sterilization counseling. Furthermore, patient-provider interactions may be complicated by a broader social and historical context in which poor and minority women's reproductive choices have not always been valued. Thus, the specific aims of this proposal are to qualitatively determine low-income women's decision support needs and preferences as well as providers' perspectives on the role of decision support around surgical sterilization (Aim 1); build a patient-directed, web-based decision aid to support women's sterilization decision making (Aim 2); and conduct a 3-site, randomized controlled trial to test the effect of the decision aid plus usual care compared to usual care alone on decision quality among 350 racially-diverse, low-income women requesting post-partum sterilization (Aim 3)."
"9302561","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overarching goal of this proposal is to push the depth penetration of multiphoton microscopy targeting neuroscience applications in need of large-scale recording of cortical activity where high resolution requirement (in the order of singl microns) cannot be relaxed. To achieve deep high-resolution imaging while retaining sufficient signal-to-noise ratio of the measurements for imaging of activity (e.g., for detection of single spikes induced calcium transients), we will develop an unconventional non-degenerate 2-photon microscopy capitalizing on the recent practical demonstration of the advantage of using long wavelength light (~1700 nm) for deep penetration 3-photon microscopy but circumventing the low probability of 3-photon absorption (3PA). Our deliverables - complementary to engineering efforts elsewhere aimed at large-volume sampling - would have a transformative impact on our ability to reconstruct spatially distributed neuronal circuit activity providing unprecedented opportunities for tests of biological hypotheses that are currently unfeasible. The seed of the new technology is a well-known phenomenon where absorption of the second photon by the fluorophore molecule is enhanced through an intermediate state induced by absorption of the first photon. This warrants an increase in the excitation efficiency given the right combination of the wavelengths. For our goal of deep penetration, the IR beam will deliver high photon flux to the focal volume inside the cortical tissue. The second higher energy photon beam will have lower intensity. Thus, while the higher energy photon beam would experience higher scattering in the brain tissue, the flux requirement for this beam will be relaxed (compared to that in the conventional 2-photon microscopy) helping to achieve deep imaging. Importantly, by increasing the intensity of the IR beam while lowering the intensity of the shorter wavelength beam, we will decrease the unwanted out-of-focus excitation on the brain surface. This is because the shorter wavelength beam will not have enough photon density at the surface while the IR beam will lie outside the degenerate 2- photon absorption (2PA) range for visible emission fluorophores. Finally, we will implement an innovative Adaptive Optics strategy to correct the phase distortions that will be experienced by the beam delivering higher energy photons. Specifically, we use the IR beam, which can be focused well deep inside the tissue, as a reference point (guiding star) and adjusting the phase of the second beam to reach the maximum overlap. Overall, we expect to achieve ~1.6 mm penetration inside the cortical tissue while avoiding excessive laser power and retaining the excitation volume characteristic for 2PA of the IR beam alone in the degenerate excitation mode. Our endpoint deliverable will be a prototype device with the proof-of-concept demonstration of its performance for imaging of brain activity in vivo using synthetic calcium indicators and genetically encoded calcium-sensitive fluorescent proteins. This project will lay the groundwork for an academic-industry partnership proposal in 3 years to fully develop and deploy the new technology as a commercial product."
"9518385","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a common and debilitating psychiatric condition. The defining feature of this disorder is worrying, which is a future-oriented and maladaptive cognitive process. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is generally effective for treating GAD, especially when combined with mindfulness approaches. However, CBT is not widely disseminated. In contrast, yoga is widely practiced to enhance mindfulness, reduce stress, and alleviate anxiety. However, little is known about the efficacy of yoga for GAD and how these strategies compare to CBT. In the current application, we propose a five-year multi-site study to examine the comparative efficacy of yoga, CBT, and stress education, a previously employed control condition, for patients with GAD. We propose to randomize 186 patients with GAD to 12-weekly yoga, CBT, or stress education sessions. Independent clinical assessments will occur before the 12-session intervention phase, at mid- treatment, after the intervention, and at 6-month follow-up. We predict greater GAD response and symptom reduction in individuals randomized to receive yoga and those who receive CBT than individuals who receive stress education at post-treatment. Moreover, we predict that the improvement in GAD symptoms in individuals receiving yoga will be comparable to those receiving CBT at post-test. Our secondary aim is to examine the long-term treatment efficacy of yoga on GAD symptoms. We hypothesize that yoga and CBT are equally effective at the 6-month follow-up. Our tertiary aim is to examine and compare the mechanism of treatment changes in yoga and CBT. We predict that treatment changes during yoga are mediated via changes in mindfulness and changes in sympathetic activation, whereas changes in CBT are mediated via changes in maladaptive cognitions. The results of this proposed study have important clinical implications for the practice of yoga and will answer important theoretical questions about the mechanism of treatment change."

The initial SWGs?Continuum of HIV Care  and Personalized HIV Care?were identified as high-priority areas that take advantage of these strengths and  local resources, and to allow our CFAR to have the greatest impact on the field. These SWGs have synergistic  goals to improve HIV care on the population and individual level, and will drive research and implementation  strategies to contribute to the TN-CFAR mission to provide HIV/AIDS research leadership at our institutions,  mentor the next generation of HIV researchers, and ultimately reduce the burden of HIV/AIDS. Specific Aims of  both SWGs will be to (1) connect clinical investigators, laboratory scientists, public health practitioners, and  community stakeholders; and (2) nurture trans-institutional and trans-disciplinary protocol teams that  implement and complete collaborative research addressing critical questions in each area. These Aims will be  achieved through processes common to each SWG that will be overseen by the Administrative Core, and  several initiatives and Sub-aims specific to each SWG. To develop the next generation of HIV/AIDS  investigators, both SWGs will implement processes specifically designed to attract new and junior  investigators, will provide an environment that fosters effective mentorship, and will assure that each  new/junior investigator has a specific mentor. These SWGs will be highly data-driven, working with the  Administrative Core and the Biostatistics and Biomedical Informatics Core to develop REDCap databases to  collect and disseminate real-time data on SWG performance. Among the most important outcome measures  will be: 1) high impact publications with trans-institutional, trans-disciplinary authorship; and 2) new grant  submissions and awards that are trans-institutional and trans-disciplinary. Additional data collected and  evaluated will include extent of engagement from all three partner institutions and community stakeholders,  new and junior investigators, and mentors identified for junior investigators. Each SWG includes an innovative  concept project led by a mentored junior investigator to be initiated in Year 1 of the TN-CFAR."
"9307124","The PPP2R2A gene encodes B55?, a B regulatory subunit of PP2A, which is found hemizygously deleted at high frequency in prostate, ovarian and luminal B breast cancer. PP2A is a Ser/Thr phosphatase that consists of a collection of trimeric holoenzymes whose substrate specificity, and thus biological function, is determined by the regulatory B subunit. There are at least fourteen known genes encoding different B subunits belonging to four unrelated gene families. While it is well known that PP2A plays a key tumor suppressor function, which inhibition is required for transformation of a variety of human normal epithelial cells and fibroblasts in cooperation with defined sets of oncogenes and inactivated tumor suppressor genes, the actual holoenzymes implicated are not well understood. Data from TCGA and others shows that PPP2R2A is deleted in the majority of prostate tumors (>50% hemizygous/~7% homozygous loss). Importantly, PPP2R2A hemizygous loss correlates with its reduced mRNA expression. Moreover, PCa patients present reduced disease free survival with this alteration. While this has led to the suggestion that PPP2R2A is a tumor suppressor, there is not data supporting that loss of this gene contributes to PCa. We have found that limited ectopic expression of B55? in PCa cell lines, which naturally express lower levels than normal prostate epithelial cells and other PCa cell lines, results in dramatic toxicity. This toxicity is linked to mitotic arrest, euploidy, cell death, and potent tumor growth inhibition in SCID mice. Our preliminary studies also show growth inhibition and architecture defects in PCa and DU145 3D organoids following inducible upregulation of B55?. Moreover, treatment of PC3 cells with phenothiazines, which bind and activate PP2A, mimic cell cycle effects seen with B55? reconstitution. We hypothesize that PPP2R2A hemizygous deletion and/or other alterations that reduce B55? expression in PrECs promote transformation and tumorigenicity and restoring B55?/PP2A activity has therapeutic potential. To test this hypothesis we propose two aims: (1). To determine the transforming potential and tumorigenicity of B55? loss/downregulation in Prostate Epithelial Cells (PrECs) and PCa cell lines and the effect of reconstitution of B55? expression in their ability to differentiate, grow and/or invade when grown as 3D organoids. (2). To determine if the growth suppressor function of B55? in 3D organoids is associated with its mitotic functions and/or the result of alterations in survival/differentiation pathways and if it can be targeted with PP2A activating drugs. Successful completion of this work will support the feasibility of multiple studies aimed at understanding (a) oncogene/tumor suppressor gene cooperativity in prostate tumor development in mice, and its correlation in human tumors; (b) signaling mechanisms and identification of key target substrates; and importantly, (c) devising strategies to therapeutically upregulate this holoenzyme in tumor cells. Because PPP2R2A alterations occur at high frequency in prostate tumors, the proposed studies will lay the molecular and biological framework for the development of novel classes of PP2A drugs that could potentially help treat the large pool of PCa patients with hemizygous deletions on PPP2R2A."
"9347354","The Epithelial Na+ Channel (ENaC) is the rate limiting step for Na+ absorption across many epithelia. In the airways of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, ENaC is abnormally hyperactive leading to disproportionate Na+ absorption and a depletion of airway surface liquid (ASL) volume. ENaC hyperactivity contributes to mucus stasis and increased incidence of airway infections that frequently lead to the death of the patient. Despite previous efforts, there are no existing therapies to treat abnormal ENaC activity in the lung. Using a proteomic screen, we have identified the protein SPLUNC1 as a potent allosteric inhibitor of ENaC that binds extra-cellularly to ENaC, reducing the amount of ENaC in the plasma membrane and subsequently limiting ENaC activity. We have also identified the ENaC-inhibitory domain of SPLUNC1, and have synthesized small peptide that corresponds to this domain, called SPX-101. This peptide robustly inhibits ENaC and prevents ASL hyperabsorption in CF airway cultures for 24 h following a single dose. SPX-101 continues to function in the presence of neutrophil elastase, which is highly abundant in CF airways, suggesting that this peptide may be therapeutically beneficial in the treatment of CF lung disease. We have also demonstrated that SPX-101 improves survival in a transgenic mouse model of CF that specifically overexpresses ENaC in the lung epithelia (?ENaC-Tg) and that SPX-101 can be effectively delivered to the lung via nebulization. Notably, SPX-101 does not induce diuresis or hyperkalemia when delivered by intravenous infusion in rats. Furthermore, nebulized SPX-101 remains sequestered within the lung and <1% of the dose administered to the lung reaches systemic circulation in rats. To advance the development of a SPX-101 for the treatment of CF we are seeking this Phase I SBIR grant to: (i) measure the effect of SPX-101 in rat, canine and ovine bronchial epithelial cells to demonstrate the relevance of these species for toxicological and translational studies, and (ii) define the maximal effective dose and fully power the dose dependent effects of SPX-101 in a CFTR inhibitor- induced inhibition of tracheal mucus velocity in sheep. Completion of the proposed work will lead to a Phase II application that will be aimed at completion of toxicology studies and human clinical trials of this novel therapy for CF."
"9337259","SUMMARY  The retina contains ~100 neuronal cell types, each of which contribute to visual processing by wiring together in distinct parallel circuits. The point of convergence for circuit determination resides in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) of the retina, where axons and dendrites from ganglion cells, bipolar cells, and amacrine cells coalesce to form a synaptic neuropil containing 10 distinct sublayers. Neurons belonging to the same circuit stratify distinct sublayers of the IPL to make circuit specific synaptic connections. The cellular and molecular cues that direct development of these layers are largely unknown but crucial to determining which neurons wire together. The objective of this application is to determine the developmental mechanisms that enable the formation of one specific circuit, the direction selective (DS) circuit. My central hypothesis is that starburst amacrine cells (SACs) create and organize the DS circuit, through interactions among themselves as well as with the arbors of other DS circuit cell types. The rationale for this work is that the DS circuit is not only of great importance to understanding organization of the IPL, but understanding how the DS circuit forms will elucidate the mechanisms used by circuits throughout the CNS. I have formulated two specific aims that will directly test my central hypothesis. Aim 1) Determine the mechanisms that initially create the DS circuit IPL sublayers. Our preliminary data suggests that SAC-SAC homotypic contact prompts stratification of the IPL. When MEGF10, a cell-surface molecule known to mediate SAC homotypic recognition, is removed, assembly of the circuit is delayed. Aim 2) Determine the mechanisms that recruit DS ganglion and bipolar cells to the DS layers of the IPL. We have discovered a mouse line that has SAC IPL projection errors. This unique tool enables me to determine if SACs recruit their synaptic partners, DS-circuit ganglion and bipolar cells, to the DS IPL sublayers. Together, these two aims will reveal the cellular and molecular mechanisms SACs use to initially stratify the IPL and direct assembly of the other DS cell types. The knowledge we gain from this study will contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms neurons in the CNS use to form cell type specific connections and will further our understanding of how the IPL develops. A thorough understanding of these processes will be required to eventually repair neural circuits after disease or injury."

Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center (RHLCCC), Keck has been one of Northwestern's Shared Resources since April 1,1999.     The Keck Facility has a set of 20 advanced instruments that together allow for integrated biophysical analyses of macromolecular structure, interactions, and function. Each particular biophysical instrument, such as a circular dichroism spectrometer, a fluorimeter, or a calorimeter, provides just one or a few individual facets of a complex overall picture. Data from many individual biophysical studies - using a diverse set of particular instruments - must be combined to yield the needed comprehensive picture.    In the past 5 years, the facility has been thoroughly modernized with state of the art equipment that replaced older instruments, addition of new technologies and capabilities, a modern internet-based reservation/administration system and many upgrades. In parallel, the Facility has invested in personnel training in order to provide users with outstanding technical expertise and assistance. To better accommodate the needs of our diverse user base, we are offering a flexible array of services. Besides counseling, training and assistance, full service options are also available on all the Facility's instruments.    The Keck Facility currently has 506 active users from 90 research groups (students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty who are authorized to use Keck Facility equipment). Researchers affiliated with the RHLCCC account for over 80% of the total utilization ofthe Facility. As such, the Keck Biophysics Facility is a critical resource for cancer research."
"9396926","Proposal Summary/Abstract While the 5-year survival rate of the most common cancers such as lung, colon, breast, and prostate cancer have improved over the last several decades, the 5-year survival rate of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have remained flat-lined at only 3%-7%. The aggressive nature of PDAC often subjugates the effects of current treatment options, and the lack of screening tools make early detection rare. The later stages of PDAC have been thoroughly characterized and studied, but the understanding of early pancreatic cancer development remains limited. The large body of published research supports the idea that pancreatic lesions originate from acinar cells that transdifferentiate into ductal-like cells- a process called acinar to ductal metaplasia (ADM). Broadly stated, this proposal aims to develop a better understanding of what drives ADM initiation and the role of ADM drivers in maintaining PDAC development. Our supporting in vitro data suggest that overexpression of transcriptional repressor REST in pancreatic acinar cells can sufficiently induce ADM transformation. While REST has been well characterized for its gene regulating role in neurogenesis, the functionality of REST in pancreatic cancer tissue remains largely unexplored. This proposal will use Chromatin Immunoprecipitation to identify direct binding targets of REST within pancreatic acinar cells, giving insight into the mechanism underlining the effects of REST in ADM progression. To determine if REST activity is necessary for ADM progression and PDAC development in vivo, this proposal will develop a novel REST mouse model with conditional knock-out of REST expression within acinar pancreatic cells. The effects of conditional REST knockout on ADM and early pre-cancerous lesions will be determined by inducing pancreatitis (PDAC pre- disposing factor) and quantifying ADM transformation. Furthermore, we will determine the effect of conditional REST knockout on impeding PDAC development and prolonging survival by crossing REST knockout mice with an established transgenic PDAC model. Our goal is to establish the role of REST activity in early and late PDAC to ultimately offer a new therapeutic target that serves as a prevention intervention for patients at high-risk of PDAC development and treatment intervention for PDAC patients."
"9314532","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is an application for renewal of a longstanding program to provide intensive training in modern methods of nephrologic research to clinically trained individuals with the M.D. or M.D./Ph.D. degree. Continued funding of seven stipends per year is requested for this joint training program that provides support for both adult and pediatric nephrology fellows. Although the highest priority of this program is to train physician-scientists, basic scientist trainees with the Ph.D. degree who are strongly committed to careers in kidney research are also supported whenever possible. Each year 3-4 new trainees are recruited into the program after completing residency training in internal medicine or pediatrics. Only fellows with a strong commitment to multi-year research training are recruited into the program. Training is provided in both laboratory-based and patient-oriented research. The training faculty is drawn from multiple clinical and basic science departments (Internal Medicine, Pediatrics, Biomedical Engineering, Cellular and Molecular Physiology, Cell Biology, Epidemiology and Public Health, Genetics, Immunobiology, Pathology, Pharmacology) and spans diverse biomedical disciplines relevant to kidney disease research (electrolyte physiology and pathophysiology, cell biology and experimental pathology, genetics and developmental biology, immunology and transplantation, vascular biology, tissue engineering, and clinical epidemiology and biostatistics). Although the core of research training is provided through work on a selected research topic under the supervision of an individual preceptor, training is enhanced by a broad array of teaching conferences, seminars and courses. Indeed, many recent fellows have enrolled in graduate degree programs specifically designed for training clinician investigators including the Investigative Medicine Ph.D. program, and the Program in Chronic Disease Epidemiology that leads to a Master of Science in Epidemiology and Public Health. Over the past 35 years this program has trained many leaders in academic nephrology, and the recent track record continues to be outstanding. The overwhelming majority of trainees who completed training during the past 10 years currently hold either full-time academic positions or research-related positions in industry, and many have successfully competed for career development faculty grants from the NIH or American Heart Association (e.g. K08, K23, Fellow-to-Faculty Transition Award) or have already obtained NIH R01 grants. The program also has made progress in achieving ethnic diversity, as four current fellows are underrepresented minority trainees."
"9318315","Clinical Translational Core Project Summary Major advances in our understanding of the genetic and environmental structure of neurodevelopmental disorders present new opportunities to prevent or ameliorate intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). The Clinical Translational Core (CTC) of the IDDRC@WUSTL will function as a conduit from new discovery in pathogenic mechanisms to clinical innovation, as well as the reverse (i.e., from clinical data acquisition to breakthroughs that deepen our understanding of complex disease mechanisms). Both directions are crucial and fundamentally interact to facilitate the development of higher-impact interventions for IDD, which is the overarching goal of the Center. The Core will catalyze this bidirectional exchange and serve as an integrative scientific hub of the IDDRC@WUSTL. The specific aims of the CTC are as follows: (1) To provide investigators with the expertise, resources, and assessment services needed to complete comprehensive behavioral and genomic characterizations of human subjects. Behavioral and genomic characterization will occur via a CTC unit structure that features a Human Behavioral Assessment Unit (HBAU) and a Human Genomic Characterization Unit (HGCU). The HBAU is a unique, multifaceted behavioral assessment program that provides state-of-the-art phenotyping relevant to the characterization of developmental, behavioral, and environmental aspect features of infants and children affected by or at risk for IDD. The HGCU was established during Year 05 of the IDDRC@WUSTL and has already garnered some $300,000 of supplemental institutional and philanthropic support, leveraging world-class facilities of WUSTL for genomic research, including the Genome Technology Access Center (GTAC) for genomic sequencing and the Genomic Engineering and iPSC Center (GEiC) of the CTSA for modeling inherited disease mechanisms. HGCU team members include international authorities in neurogenetics, clinical genetics, and human genetics (including deep expertise in the interpretation of deleteriousness of disease-causing variants). (2) to strategically harness services and expertise of allied WUSTL facilities that critically and cost-effectively complement the IDDRC@WUSTL scientific cores to constitute a discovery pipeline for higher-impact intervention for individuals affected by or at risk for IDD.

"9313709","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the proposed training plan is to further develop the applicant's knowledge and research skills in the areas of mood dysregulation, neurocognition, neuro-immunology, advanced statistical methods, and ethics. In line with these goals, the cornerstone of the applicant's training will be the daily activities associated with the proposed study of the inflammatory processes underlying negative mood disturbances and cognitive dysfunction among youth. In addition, this project is carefully aligned with structured training and mentoring experiences to promote the applicant's ultimate career goal to conduct high-quality translational research as an independent investigator on the neurobiological risk factors for affective dysregulation and cognitive dysfunction throughout development that inform the prevention of illness progression and timing of interventions. This training plan includes course work, experience with longitudinal methods and data analyses, regular sponsor meetings, clinical practice, and professional development activities. The proposed research will complement this training plan by providing applied experience with biochemical and neurocognitive methodology, clinical sample recruitment and screening, and data analysis and interpretation. This particular research topic was chosen not only because it fits well with the applicant's career goals and prior experience, but also because depression is highly prevalent among youth and an enormous public health problem, ranking as the leading cause of disability, mortality, and impairment among youth. Further, this project is aligned with the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative to apply a dimensional approach to study the specific sub- domains of loss within the dimension of negative valence, and cognitive control within the dimension of cognitive systems, that represent core dysfunctions in depression. The proposed project has potential implications for informing the discovery of novel therapeutic targets and the translation of this information into effective treatments specific to youth along a spectrum of severity at elevated risk for a chronic and recurrent course of illness.  Immune system response, triggered by stress, is thought to interact with multiple systems (e.g. neurotransmitter metabolism, neuroendocrine function) to predispose towards depression and neurocognitive dysfunction. Therefore, markers of this response may represent a key advance in understanding biomarkers of stress, loss, and cognitive control in mood disorders, as few studies have linked peripheral markers with dimensions of mood and cognition. Further, studies of these markers are strikingly rare among children and adolescents, despite significant methodological obstacles to generalizing findings from adults to youth. Therefore, Aim 1 of the proposed study is to demonstrate differences between youth with any mood disorder (AMD spectrum) and healthy controls in loss and evaluate the association between peripheral inflammatory markers and the loss sub-domain. Aim 2 is to demonstrate differences between AMD spectrum and HC in cognitive control and evaluate the association between peripheral inflammatory markers and the cognitive control sub-domain. Aim 3 is to test the impact of life stress on the association of inflammatory makers with loss and cognitive control. Data will be collected from 30 individuals with a range of negative mood disturbance (AMD spectrum, inclusive of sub-threshold and unspecified conditions) and 30 healthy controls ages 10-17. Mentorship for this project will be provided by experts in the areas of mood dysregulation during development (Dr. Amy West), neurocognition (Dr. Scott Langenecker), neuro-immune function (Drs. Pandey and Goldstein) and data analysis (Dr. Henry). This study will be the first to utilize a dimensional modeling perspective to understanding the associations of inflammation, loss, cognitive control, and stress among youth, as well as one of the first to relate immune system response with measures of neurocognitive function. Thus, the proposed fellowship will be instrumental in propelling the applicant's career and promises to yield results that help specify whether there exist critical periods for neurobiological markers of mood and neurocognitive dysfunction. If the hypotheses are supported it would suggest that targeting biological stress response systems in treatment may disrupt the feed-forward cycle between inflammatory response, mood dysregulation, and neurocognitive dysfunction."

Pilot and Exploratory Studies Core (PESC) The objective of the Pilot/Exploratory Studies Core (PESC) of the Duke OAIC is to conduct high quality Pilot Projects that inform the selection, design, and conduct of subsequent larger, hypothesis-driven research in our theme: to understand and optimize reserve and resilience. The Specific Aims are to: 1) advance top quality science related to late-life reserve and resilience, 2) attract and nurture a diverse cadre of outstanding early investigators in aging research or established investigators pursuing promising new directions related to our theme, and 3) build and sustain relationships with critical stakeholders to maximize the impact and translation of the work conducted through this and future OAICs. By leveraging institutional funding, we will support at least three Pilot Projects per year. We use small exploratory pilot monies as a rapid response mechanism to take advantage of cutting edge areas. The PESC solicits and selects high quality pilot studies from across Duke University Medical Center using a rigorous, multi-stage process that incorporates internal and external review. The PESC carefully monitors study progress and assists in the development of larger grant proposals from pilot study findings. To accomplish our Aims, the Duke PESC includes several highly innovative features: 1) the Pilot Grants Workshop, developed by OAIC Director Kenneth Schmader and frequently requested in national venues, 2) the inclusion of patient/community representatives on the Review Panel selecting pilots, 3) the Data Integration Working Group, which is a central hub for scientific development, oversight, and promoting translation, and 4) mechanisms that support the science and careers of unfunded pilot study applicants. Four Pilot Projects are proposed in the first two years. PES1 investigates the feasibility and efficacy of a pre- operative exercise intervention (?prehabilitation?) to enhance resilience for older adults undergoing elective surgery. PES2 investigates the role of transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4)-mediated mechano- transduction in restoring the reserve capacity of old chondrocytes, potentially improving their ability to withstand physiological load and avoid osteoarthritis. PES3 will demonstrate the effect of aging on autophagy in muscle stem cells and seek specific mechanistic targets for enhancing muscle reserve and reducing sarcopenia. PES4 incorporates clinical and biological data to develop clinical prediction rules useful in predicting resilience in older multiple myeloma patients undergoing chemotherapy. The PESC impacts public health by performing studies that develop knowledge to maintain or recover independence in older Americans, by promoting reserve and resilience in the face of chronic and acute stressors."
"9313330","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research on spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8) supported by this application has led to two discoveries that fundamentally change our understanding of how a broad category of microsatellite expansion mutations are expressed. First, we demonstrated that the SCA8 CTG?CAG expansion is bidirectionally transcribed1. This was the first demonstration that a single expansion mutation could lead to the expression and accumulation of toxic CUG and CAG expansion RNAs and a CAG-encoded polyGln expansion protein1. Second, we discovered that the canonical rules of translation do not apply for CTG?CAG repeats and that CAG and CUG expansion transcripts can express homopolymeric expansion proteins in all three frames without an AUG start codon2. We showed this repeat associated non-ATG (RAN) translation is hairpin-dependent, occurs without frameshifting or RNA editing and is observed in cell culture and SCA8 patient tissues2. RAN translation also occurs in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1)2, C9ORF72 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia (ALS/FTD9)3-5, and fragile X tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS)6. The discoveries of bidirectional transcription and RAN translation change our understanding of how genes are expressed and highlight the need for therapies that target both sense and antisense transcripts as well as RAN proteins. Our central hypothesis is that both RNA and RAN gain of function (GOF) contribute to SCA8 and can be mitigated by therapies based on MBNL1 overexpression or RNA knockdown. Our specific aims will test the following hypotheses: 1) RNA gain of function and RAN translation contribute to SCA8; 2) RAN translation can be modulated by MBNL proteins and stress pathways; 3) antisense oligo (ASO) knockdown of ATXN8 and ATXN8OS will block RNA and RAN effects and reverse disease in an SCA8 mouse model."
"9317820","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Substance use increases dramatically during college and is associated with significant negative effects for individuals and society1?3. To improve the efficacy of interventions designed to decrease collegiate substance use, we must identify risk factors that are amenable to change. Whereas numerous established risk factors (e.g., gender, SES, ethnicity) are difficult or impossible to change, poor self-regulation is malleable6. Substance use and addiction is somewhat more common in poor self-regulators5,7?10, as assessed by self-reports and experimental paradigms with limited ecological validity (e.g., stop-signal, Go-NoGo). Employing more meaningful appetitive self-regulation paradigms (e.g., craving reappraisal) may help clarify the relationship between self-regulation and substance use in late adolescence. Currently, most extant work on reappraisal during this time has relied on experimental paradigms instructing participants to regulate their affective82,83 or appetitive35,36 reactions to stimuli. However, in late adolescence, when many individuals leave the family home, intrinsic motivation and the ability to autonomously self-regulate consummative behavior in the absence of external cues becomes a crucial asset likely to promote positive developmental trajectories. Research strongly supports the relationship between autonomy and health and well-being11, and autonomy enhances self- regulation and is associated with distinct patterns of neural activity49,50. Pilot data from our lab further suggests that neural activity during autonomous regulation is a better predictor than controlled (extrinsically motivated) regulation of various substance use outcomes during the transition to college. In order to better understand the role self-regulation plays in late adolescent substance use, this proposal aims to 1) validate the use of food craving reappraisal as a developmentally appropriate model of appetitive self-regulation in the context of substance use, and 2) characterize the ability of autonomous and controlled regulation to predict substance use trajectories during the transition to college, above and beyond other established risk factors. Appetitive self-regulation will be assessed during neuroimaging, using a paradigm designed to examine autonomous and controlled reappraisal of the desire to consume personally-craved foods13,17,35. We propose to use personally- craved foods as a developmentally appropriate model for resisting a broader range of potentially harmful temptations encountered during the transition to college. Substance use will be assessed four times: once immediately prior to starting college and again each quarter during freshman year. This will allow us to investigate individual differences in changes in substance use and related outcomes. The proposed program of research will help refine neurobiological theories about self-regulation during periods of significant change in external regulatory scaffolding, and is essential to the development of targeted interventions aimed at helping adolescents autonomously resist the temptation to engage in substance use behaviors."

Numerous genetic variants with a moderate to high effect in relevant pathways were found to be present in this cohort. In particular, we identified 2 deleterious and 5 potentially damaging variants in the ATM gene in the normal DNA from these high-risk women with ovarian cancer. The role of ATM in ovarian cancer has been underestimated because of a lack of functional assays for the effects of these genetic changes. In this project we will pilot the development of a general approach to determine the nature of private and rare mutations in DNA repair associated genes using cell-based functional assays. The functional analysis of novel germline variants in the gene ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) will be studied in immortalized normal ovarian and mammary epithelial cells. This approach is superior to using established tumor cells that already have DNA repair defects. The PI's lab is experienced in studying the genetics of cancer and the ramifications of mutant hereditary cancer genes on normal cell biology and genomic instability focusing previously on Li-Fraumeni Syndrome. ATM codes for a protein kinase that regulates the DNA damage response initiating the signaling cascades that activate cell cycle checkpoints and the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. We will develop cell-based assays that can be used for the functional analysis of genetic variants of unknown significance (VUSs) in the ATM gene. ATM mutations are associated with the risk of breast cancer; however little information is available on ovarian cancer. Therefore, we will compare the biological and biochemical impact on immortalized normal mammary and ovarian epithelial cells that have had their ATM genes edited to contain the SNPs that we have identified in patients' DNA. We will determine whether these clearly deleterious and potentially damaging variants have significant impact on cell cycle or DNA repair mechanisms in a cell type specific fashion. Deleterious and potentially damaging VUSs in ATM were statistically overrepresented in our cohort (Table 1) compared to the MAF in the 1000 genomes database. However each VUS will require some functional analysis to provide clinically useful information to patients. This project will be pursued in two aims: AIM 1: We will employ gene editing of the endogenous ATM gene in hTERT immortalized normal mammary and ovarian epithelial cells using CRISPR/Cas9 to produce potentially deleterious ATM variants. AIM 2: Using functional assays in pathways known to be associated with inherited risk of ovarian cancer we will determine the impact of these VUSs on cell cycle control and DNA repair mechanisms."
"9388170","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Bisphenol A (BPA) is commonly used in plastics and epoxies, and has been shown to leach from these materials under certain conditions. Although it provides desirable material properties, numerous studies have shown adverse health effects after exposure, particularly in developing fetuses, infants, and children. In this work, we aim to develop and utilize a high-throughput platform for assessing the relative toxicity of BPA and BPA substitutes (both known and novel) in neurodevelopment using Schmidtea mediterranea planaria as a novel model system. Planaria are small freshwater flatworms. They possess a central nervous system consisting of a bilobed ?brain? called the cephalic ganglia and two ventral nerve cords that traverse the length of the body and support a peripheral nerve ladder. Most remarkably, these animals have the ability to regenerate their entire body, including the central nervous system, from almost any piece of the organism due to a large population of pluripotent adult stem cells called neoblasts. Previous work by the investigative team has shown that planarian head regeneration is impeded by exposure to alcohol or BPA, which suggests that neurodevelopmental toxicity in planaria may be analogous to that in humans. One major goal of this exploratory research is to categorize the effects of BPA and BPA substitutes on neuroregeneration and neurodevelopmental processes by developing and utilizing a high-throughput platform for assessing the relative toxic effects of BPA and BPA substitutes, including those effects that are dependent upon timing, duration, and dosage of exposure. Additionally, in this project, the investigators aim to develop and produce novel BPA substitutes that are derived from renewable resources, and to assess the relative toxicity of these alternatives using the high-throughput planaria testing platform. The ultimate objective of these substitutes is that the novel compound provides equivalent or superior material properties with reduced toxicity and the environmental advantages associated with development using sustainable practices and renewable resources. Taken together, the results of this work will enhance our understanding of neurodevelopmental toxicity by BPA and BPA substitutes, and provide potential novel BPA substitutes that could have equivalent or superior material properties and reduced toxicity."
"9411664","PROJECT SUMMARY One strategy for eradicating the HIV-1 viral reservoir combines a means of activating viral gene expression in latently infected T cells (a ?kick?) with a way to eliminate these activated cells (a ?kill?). The TLR7 agonist GS-9620 is a safe, well tolerated latency reversing agent that indirectly induces latently infected T cells to produce virus. Preliminary data indicates that it can partially reduce, or in some cases perhaps completely eliminate, the SIV reservoir in rhesus macaques. eCD4-Ig is an antibody- like entry inhibitor with unmatched breadth and very potent neutralizing and antibody-dependent cell- mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) activities against HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV. Moreover, it can protect macaques against from repeated high-dose challenges with two divergent viruses ? SIVmac239 and SHIV-AD8. Finally a single dose of an IgG1 form of human eCD4-Ig protein can suppress infection in macaques by 2.5 logs without evidence of viral escape. eCD4-Ig?s potent neutralization and ADCC activities, and its exceptional breadth, suggest that it may uniquely overcome the diversity of the viral reservoir and facilitate the elimination of most reactivated cells. Accordingly, we will test the hypothesis that the effector functions of eCD4-Ig can accelerate reduction of the latent reservoir observed in GS-9620-treated macaques. To do so, we will first optimize the half- life, immunogenicity, neutralization potency, and ADCC activities of eCD4-Ig. We will then optimize the schedule, dosing, and route of administration of GS-9620, and establish the relationship between GS- 9620-induced virus ?blips? and reservoir reduction. Finally, we will compare GS-9620, eCD4-Ig, and both therapies combined, for their abilities to reduce the size of the latent reservoir and/or establish a stable state of virologic control. If successful, these studies will lay a foundation for future human clinical trials combining GS-9620 and eCD4-Ig."
"9485628","Area CA 1 of the hippocampus plays a key role in learning and memory. CA 1 pyramidal neurons receive two major input streams, one from the entorhinal cortex that mediates sensory information about the external world, and another from area CA3 that mediates retrieval of previously stored representations. The neuromodulator acetylcholine (ACh) is thought to gate encoding and retrieval. Our preliminary results indicate that ACh, by activating the Ca2+-activated nonspecific cation current ICAN and modulating other ion channels, dramatically affects the intrinsic response to a triangular current ramp simulating the excitatory input, thus levels of ACh may regulate the pattern of place field firing by shifting the peak to later positions in ramp. This shift could cause the coding to shift from prospective, representing upcoming locations, to retrospective, representing recently visited locations, which may favor encoding over retrieval. Our preliminary data also shows that ACh can induce sustained firing; since novelty increases ACh levels, this persistent firing may facilitate the synaptic plasticity required to form new place fields. Moreover, we find that there are both intrinsic and synaptic mechanisms that endow CA 1 pyramidal neurons with low pass filtering capabilities specific to the Schaffer collateral (SC) inputs from CA3, and that these capabilities are switched off by ACh. In Aim 1, we test the hypothesis that cholinergic modulation converts the shape of the rate response to a triangular current ramp from decelerating to accelerating in a dose-dependent fashion, with a concomitant shift in the peak. In Aim 2, we test the hypotheses that intrinsic properties of CA 1 neurons mediate low pass filtering of SC inputs, with a critical additional component provided by parvalbumin-positive (PV+) basket cells, and that cholinergic modulation removes the low pass filtering, such that CA 1 can follow higher input frequencies from CA3. This work seeks to elucidate the neural bases of complex behaviors and mental illnesses. Better understanding of the mechanisms underlying cholinergic modulation of neuronal ensembles may lead not only to an improved understanding of information processing important in learning and memory, but eventually to improved therapies for cognitive disorders."
"9321085","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - OVERALL The principal aim of the UC Davis ADC (UCD ADC) is to measure trajectories of cognitive change and transition to dementia among a carefully studied and highly diverse subject cohort in order identify modifiable risk and protective factors with the ultimate goal of developing novel interventions to improve cognitive health and prevent dementia. This principal aim is accomplished through recruitment, maintenance and longitudinal follow up to autopsy of a cohort of subjects from both community and clinical referral sources that varies along the spectrum of cognitive ability, race/ethnicity, educational achievement, social economic status, spoken language and degrees of medical comorbidity. To accomplish this principal aim, the UCD ADC utilizes six highly integrated resource cores and a research education component to create a strong research infrastructure while emphasizing a highly collaborative environment to facilitate novel research efforts, education and training. In addition, UCD ADC encourages researcher diversity through the newly developed Latino Aging Research Resource Center (LARRC) a NIA Resource Center in Minority Aging Research (RCMAR) program. This highly diverse and predominantly cognitively normal cohort was developed to pursue four major scientific themes: 1) identify the earliest clinical and biological evidence of age-related dementing diseases, 2) identify and evaluate protective factors with emphasis on developing strategies to increase cerebral reserve or resistance to age-related degenerative diseases, 3) examination of the impact of mixed pathological processes on cognitive decline and conversion to dementia and 4) discovery and evaluation of biological markers of cognitive health or decline. In line with the pressing need to develop novel clinical therapeutics for AD, the UCD ADC also has begun to support investigator sponsored therapeutic studies. This work, performed in a highly collaborative and inclusive environment that fully utilizes the unique resources of the UC Davis environment and the skills of our collaborators, not only aims to advance new scientific knowledge, but also encourages new and innovative research, improved clinical diagnoses, training, patient and community education and superb data management and data sharing to leverage ongoing activities of the UCD ADC to the wider research and educational community. To obtain these objectives, the overall specific aims of the UCD ADC are to: Provide an environment and core resources to enhance cutting-edge research as well as encouraging extensive use of these resources by basic science, biomedical, behavioral, social and clinical investigators. Manage these resources ethically, responsibly and efficiently through a well-established and highly effective administrative structure that seeks to foster new and innovative areas of research and treatments. Provide investigators and research groups with a unique resource of well-characterized patients and control subjects through recruitment, retention and comprehensive assessment of a highly diverse cohort. Provide a rich training environment for students, fellows and junior faculty to acquire research skills and experience in interdisciplinary aging and dementia research as well as mentor new and diverse faculty members. Respond effectively to national needs related to AD and associated dementing disorders by timely submission of NACC reports, support of NACC data acquisition through MRI analyses and DNA submissions. Educate individuals across the knowledge spectrum from medical professionals to the lay public and share new scientific information developed at the UCD ADC with NIA stakeholders. Continue dementia advocacy in collaboration with the Alzheimer's Association at local, national and international levels, as well as supporting the NIA through service on various committees."
"9443832","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop, test, and apply a new computerized adaptive testing approach to measuring severity of depression, anxiety, mania, disruptive behavior, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders in children and adolescents (9-17 years). This proposal contributes both methodologically and scientifically to research on the assessment of pediatric psychopathology. The proposed work will advance mental health research and improve psychiatric screening and monitoring in primary care.  The methodological work proposed in this application is driven by a fundamental scientific challenge that has limited progress in measuring psychopathology in pediatric populations. We need to understand how the measurement of psychopathology in youth changes from childhood through adolescence. Our proposed work includes new statistical methodology for a Computerized Adaptive Test (CAT) based on multidimensional Item Response Theory (IRT) that allows us to tailor the measurement process to each child's developmental level (vertical scaling). The overarching aim of this application is to develop a CAT for children and adolescents that achieves the following goals: Aim 1: Provides dimensional severity scores for depression, mania, anxiety, disruptive behavioral disorders (DBDs), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Aim 2: Identifies children and adolescents who have symptom severity associated with functional impairment who would potentially benefit from a more extensive diagnostic assessment to evaluate the need for treatment. Aim 3: Uses differential item functioning to identify a set of items that optimally discriminate high and low levels of severity or each of psychopathology dimension equally well for parent and child ratings of that dimension. Aim 4:Accurately predicts DSM categorical diagnoses of major depressive disorder (MDD), ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), conduct disorder (CD), anxiety disorders (AD; generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, social phobia, specific phobia), and bipolar disorder (BD). Exploratory Aim: Using the same powerful psychometric strategies, we will take several important steps toward developing and testing of a parallel CAT measure of two of the core biopsychological processes identified in the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC). To achieve these aims, we will develop a bank of approximately 1000 items addressing at different developmental levels symptoms of depression (including a subdomain of suicidality), mania, anxiety, DBDs and ADHD, as well as positive and negative valence RDoC domains. We will then calibrate the item bank using a bifactor IRT model and then develop, test and validate CAT-based administration."
"9386172","Project summary/Abstract Increased lifespan in developed countries has led to a higher prevalence of aging-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer Disease (AD). These diseases are characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins in aggregates. Under stress conditions, eukaryotic cells efficiently over-express molecular chaperones or heat shock proteins (HSPs), preventing proteins from unfolding and forming aggregates. The robust expression of HSP70 relies on the Heat Shock transcription Factor 1 (HSF1) and the translation elongation factor 1A1 (eEF1A1) which links HSP70 transcription to translation. This coupling suggests a role for the translational machinery in activating the stress response to adapt the transcriptome and assist protein quality control. We hypothesize that certain neurons are prone to accumulate unfolded proteins because of their inability to activate an efficient stress response. This deficiency could result from the switch in the expression of eEF1A1 to the isoform eEF1A2, characteristic of postnatal development of specific neurons. eEF1A2 is unable to mediate HSP70 expression and could enhance neuronal vulnerability to accumulate unfolded protein aggregates. Hence, the goals of this proposal are: 1) Engineer a ?therapeutic? eEF1A isoform to dissociate protein aggregates that cause neurodegeneration and 2) Characterize how eEF1A isoforms tune the molecular response to damage in hippocampal neurons. The stress response mechanisms as well as eEF1A protein are highly conserved between yeast and mammals and protein aggregation models mimicking human diseases already exist. Therefore, the versatile and fast manipulation of the yeast S. cerevisiae is tremendously advantageous for this proposal. For each new therapeutic eEF1A isoform, the expression of these molecular chaperones will be characterized at the single cell and single-molecule level. The mechanism and efficiency of the selected isoforms on restoring protein homeostasis in individual cells will be tested. Single cell and single-molecule techniques provide the spatial and temporal resolution required to interrogate rare cell populations like hippocampal neurons. Therefore, primary hippocampal cultures will be subjected to different stresses and single molecule FISH will be used to assess molecular chaperone biogenesis. These experiments will identify the localization of HSPs genes, their transcriptional output and the distribution of the mature transcripts. In parallel, and considering the amino acid differences between eEF1A1 and eEF1A2, a therapeutic EF1A2 isoform will be engineered to fulfill chaperone induction without altering neuronal translational competence. This proposal will stablish a new perspective on the etiology of neurodegenerative disorders and approximations to treat them. ! !"
"9319831","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The NINDS Stroke Trial Network (NSTN) has been charged with the development and testing of new therapies for stroke treatment, recovery/rehabilitation, and prevention that can decrease the global burden of stroke. The overall goal of this National Coordinating Center (NCC) application for the NSTN is to provide interdisciplinary leadership, expertise, innovation, and infra-structure for the efficient initiatin, completion, and dissemination of results of Phase I, II and III stroke trials, as well as biomarker-validation studies, as prioritized by the NSTN and NINDS leadership. Our NCC leadership team has extensive experience in initiating, directing, and completing large multi-center trials. The recent Stroke PRG and NINDS review of the SPOTRIAS program recognized the importance of a stroke-oriented clinical trial network, the growing collaboration among SPOTRIAS centers, and the need for similar networks for stroke recovery and prevention. However, in reality, there has been no organized coordinated approach to stroke trials in the U.S. As result, multiple NINDS- funded trials have directly competed against one another within the same treatment space at the same institutions, thereby slowing recruitment for all of the trials. Finally, entire trial infrastructures have been created and then dismantled with each large NINDS-funded Phase II and Phase III stroke trial; this has resulted in enormous inefficiency and increased costs in the evaluation of new treatments. Our Specific Aims for the NCC and the entire NSTN are: 1) create the NSTN infrastructure and initiate collaborative relationships within the NSTN and with the NETT, NeuroNext, ongoing NINDS-funded stroke trials, CTSAs, non-U.S. stroke networks, and industry. 2) Facilitate the design, oversight, and management of 6-8 Phase I to III clinical trials of acute treatment, recovery/rehabilitation, and prevention within the next five yers and meet recruitment goals by addressing recruitment barriers within the NSTN, collaborating with other NINDS-funded networks and non- U.S. stroke networks, and establishing a rigorous quality control process for monitoring recruitment, adherence to established deadlines, and protocol compliance to facilitate the overall success of the RCCs. 3) Implement network-wide educational activities and mentoring programs for NSTN fellows, faculty, and coordinators in collaboration with the NETT and NeuroNext networks."
"9425932","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses the RFA: Effectiveness of Treatment for Oral Diseases in Medically Compromised Patients (R01). Radiation therapy (RT) for head and neck (H&N) cancer has significant long-term adverse effects, including irreversible hyposalivation and xerostomia, which result in increased rates of dental caries and tooth loss. RT also impairs the ability of bone to heal, leading to a life-long risk of osteoradionecrosis (ORN), often precipitated by dental extractions. Consequently, these patients are caught in a vicious circle, being at higher risk of needing dental extractions, but with extractions to be avoided post-RT due to risk for ORN. To reduce such complications, pre-RT dental assessment is now considered a best practice. However, pre- and post-RT dental management varies widely among centers, due to lack of reliable data on which evidence-based guidelines can be based. The objectives of this prospective observational cohort study are to collect data on dental outcomes after H&N RT, to identify risk factors associated with tooth loss and restoration failure, and to conduct selected comparative effectiveness analyses among dental restorative materials (some of which have been reported to have very high failure rates in this population). The specific aims are: 1.To measure the 2-year rate of tooth loss in patients who have received a standard of care dental assessment prior to H&N RT. A multi-center longitudinal cohort study will be conducted of H&N cancer patients who are to receive high-dose RT. All subjects will receive a standard-of-care pre-RT dental assessment with detailed documentation of dental/oral status and pre-RT dental management. Tooth loss will be documented at follow- up visits every 6 months. Secondary analyses will assess risk factors for tooth loss by examining associations between oral health status variables (for example: periodontal index) prior to RT and subsequent tooth loss. 2. To measure failure rates of the most commonly used dental restorative materials in patients who have received H&N RT. Additional clinical assessments, at the pre-RT and follow-up study visits, will include documentation of date and type of restorations placed and of restoration failure or replacement. Secondary analyses will compare failure rates for the most common restorative materials, and assess risk factors for restoration failure by examining associations between variables affecting oral health status (for example: fluoride use) and subsequent restoration failure. The proposed research will provide evidence to guide decision-making for optimal management of these complex patients. This contribution will be highly significant because it will directly improve patient care and outcomes by identifying evidence-based best practices for the pre- and post-RT dental management of patients receiving H&N RT. This research will enable the long-term outcome goal of developing evidence-based guidelines for management of dental disease in these patients."
"9340305","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The College of Health Science (CHS), Addis Ababa University (AAU) is submitting this application entitled, MEPI Scholars Program for Developing Research Capacity of Junior Faculty at Addis Ababa University with the goal of upgrading research capacity through creating cohorts of core faculty with specialized research skills and careers in four selected scientific disciplines (HIV/AIDS and related infections, maternal and child health, non-communicable diseases [e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular], and mental health) which are strategic components of the AAU CHS development plan. The main objectives of the training program are: to build core capacity in research through training of cohorts of junior faculty in selected priority scientific disciplines; to provide long-term didactic and mentored research and research training opportunities (2 years) to promising AAU junior faculty to advance their overall career development; and to continue to improve the research infrastructure and research support at CHS including the AAU Office of Research Administration (ORA) and strengthen graduate and certificate research training programs within the CHS. Four scientific areas are targeted in this application: HIV/AIDS and related infections, maternal and child health, non-communicable diseases [e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular], and mental health. These are topics that reflect priority health challenges in Ethiopia with need to train researchers who can conduct high quality research to fill in critical knowledge and implementation gaps. Research training in the selected four scientific topics will have synergistic effects within the overall development of research capacity at AAU as well as at the national level. The training design consists of didactic training and mentored research training and will be conducted primarily in-country, enhanced by semester-long distance learning courses developed during the first Medical Education Partnership Initiative (MEPI) cycle and a series of in-country short courses. The proposed program will include training in: research methods, grant writing, biostatistics and data management; ethics; and advanced trainings on content-specific subjects in the four scientific disciplines of focus. Mentorship will be provided by mentoring teams, which include a senior faculty member from CHS, and a mentor from a U.S. partner collaborating institution. This new program will therefore provide opportunities for hands-on and classroom-based research training by providing trainees with protected time, high quality didactics and mentored research training. It will address research capacity gaps including limited time, resources, and institutional capacity, and insufficient opportunities to work on relevant research, and is responsive to institutional needs, building upon existing efforts, and leveraging other ongoing training infrastructure and collaborations. Existing collaborations under the first cycle o MEPI will be further developed with Emory University as the primary training partner and Johns Hopkins University and University of Alabama providing advanced trainings and mentorship in focus area topics. The program aims to train a total of 24 junior faculty members: six trainees per scientific topic area. There will be a competitive and transparent process to select AAU junior faculty trainees for the program. Eligible participants will include both physician and PhD-level junior faculty at AAU who are committed to a research career. The duration of research training will be two years for each cohort and trainees will develop a hypothesis driven research proposal to be carried out under the guidance of their dual Ethiopian- U.S. mentoring team. A cohort of 8 junior faculty will be enrolled the first year and the third year and a cohort of 4 wil be enrolled in the third and fourth year. The program is also expected to enhance the research training and infrastructure of the institution to continue to train junior faculty and produce strog, sustainable interdisciplinary research teams that can address the priority health challenges of the nation."
"9317437","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Moderate to severe pain following surgery is common, even after surgeries thought of as minor. Opioids are the mainstay for acute postoperative pain care despite their known side effects and related adverse events. Most research to date has focused on the anesthetic and surgical factors associated with higher acute pain, thereby largely ignoring the inter-patient variability in pain sensitivity. As such, pharmacological adjuncts to opioids and regional anesthetics have been broadly applied in an all or none fashion rather than personalized based on patient characteristics. There is a growing appreciation of the importance of altered central nervous system (CNS) processing of pain and other symptoms in chronic pain states. The widespread body pain, hyperalgesia and comorbid symptomatology of centralized pain states has been best studied in fibromyalgia. Rather than being present or absent, fibromyalgia symptoms occur on a continuum that has been termed fibromyalgianess and can serve as a crude surrogate of the degree of centralization. Opioids are thought to be less effective in centralized pain patients. Our primary hypothesis is that although peripheral nociceptive input is important in the acute pain response, some patients possess varying degrees of CNS amplification (higher fibromyalgianess) that plays an equally or even more prominent role in the expression of pain and opioid consumption. Thus, we hypothesize that the patients with pain that is more centralized in that the degree of pain centralization as measured on a simple self-report measure strongly predicts acute opioid pain responsiveness by providing a surrogate measure of endogenous opioid tone. To test our hypothesis, we will conduct a prospective assessment of pain, opioid consumption and adverse acute postoperative period in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (n=200). These data will be used to assess whether fibromyalgianess predicts higher acute pain, more opioid consumption, and a lesser response of pain for the opioids administered. To assess the mechanistic underpinnings of these clinical findings, we will conduct preoperative functional imaging (fMRI and PET scanning) in 60 of the 200 knee arthroplasty patients across the continuum of fibromyalgianess to determine preoperative opioid tone and previously described brain imaging findings of hyperalgesia. The opioid consumption and pain reports will then be analyzed with the brain imaging findings. Consistent with our long term goal of personalized pain medicine, the proposed research could have a major impact on clinical practice because a subset of individuals could be easily identified who would be strong candidates for non- or reduced opioid acute analgesic regimens."
"9356351","Summary/Abstract  Vascular cognitive impairment dementia (VCID) is a heterogeneous disease that is an important cause of dementia. This proposal is in response to a RFA to identify biomarkers to separate patients into subgroups for treatment trials. Although much is known about multiple biomarkers individually, there is a major gap in our understanding of the optimal ones to use in collaborative studies, which is the aim of this proposal. Subcortical ischemic vascular disease (SIVD) is the progressive small vessel disease (SVD) form that is optimal for treatment trials. MRI modalities and CSF biochemical studies provide the most promising biomarkers. White matter damage is the hallmark of SIVD, and MRI is the optimal method to show the progressive changes. Biochemical studies of CSF show the inflammatory biomarkers of albumin, matrix metaloproteinases (MMPs) and cytokines. In an on-going clinical study of SIVD, our group has identified microstructural studies with MRI and biochemical studies of MMPs in the CSF as the two most promising biomarkers. This two-phase, milestone-driven proposal is to identify the optimal microstructural and biochemical biomarkers to both identify the SIVD subgroup and to use as surrogate markers of progression. In the first U2 phase, the optimal method to measure CSF MMPs will be determined for patient classification and the optimal MRI biomarkers to show progression will be determined. Normal-appearing white matter (NAWM), which is a region with normal FLAIR signal, often has abnormal diffusion signals, indicating tissue at risk (prodromal). The hypothesis is that CSF and MRI biomarkers can be used for classification of SIVD patients with CSF for primarily classification and MRI for both classification and as a surrogate marker for predicting disease progression that can be used for patient treatment decisions. There are three specific aims: 1) to demonstrate that the growth of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) as defined by FLAIR images can be predicted based on biomarkers calculated from multi-shell, high b-value diffusion MRI (dMRI); 2) to identify functional brain connectivity, structural brain connectivity and gray matter atrophy biomarkers that predict cognitive decline (executive and memory function) in VCID subjects over a period of two to three years; and, 3) to compare MMP measurements made with zymography with two novel methods, including an ELISA-based method and an activity assay based on immunocapture and fluorescent peptide cleavage in order to optimize the biochemical studies. This proposal will fill a gap in knowledge as to the optimal biomarkers to use for collaborative studies. The major aims are related to refining the set of biomarkers for patient selection, which will be done in the U2 phase by increasing the size of the existing University of New Mexico (UNM) cohort from 100 to 200 patients, and to perform the CSF studies for patient classification and the dMRI studies longitudinally to define surrogate markers to use for outcome measures in clinical trials in the U3 phase. The long-term goal is to have the biomarkers in place by the time the future treatment trials are planned in the fifth year."
"9382998","Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infections kill approximately 1.5 million people annually. Although tuberculosis generally remains confined to the lung, pathogenic mycobacteria also are able to disseminate to other tissues. The interplay of bacterial and host factors that contribute to dissemination is incompletely understood. We identified an outbreak strain that presents with high rates of extrapulmonary dissemination and an extremely high rate of tuberculous bone disease. We have sequenced and assembled the NCG genome and find that is a member of an ancient Mtb lineage. We have identified the Type VII secretion system substrate EsxM as intact in the outbreak strain but truncated in all modern Mtb strains and hypothesize that the ancient variant is an important contributor to bone dissemination.  We have developed a zebrafish model to directly examine dissemination and bone disease during mycobacterial infection with Mycobacterium marinum. Using this model we can perform live visualization of osteoblast and osteoclast dynamics. We have found that the full-length versions of EsxM found in M. marinum and ancient lineages of Mtb promote dissemination to bone and are sufficient to modulate macrophage motility. We will 1) interrogate the function of EsxM in modulating the behavior of infected macrophages; 2) identify mechansisms by which EsxM interacts with specific host proteins in macrophages 3) translate these findings in mouse models of dissemination and bone disease. These studies will provide insights into the genetic basis of mycobacterial dissemination and bone disease, a fundamentally important question in our understanding of tuberculosis and other infectious diseases."
"9403459","Abstract:  In the past decade a number of alternative vaping products have hit the market, rapidly gaining consumers among adults and, especially, adolescents. Electronic nicotine delivery systems or e-cigarettes (e-Cigs) have become the sought-after product due to the belief that they are much safer than traditional cigarettes. Moreover, tobacco smoking (TS) is associated with vascular endothelial dysfunction in a causative and dose dependent manner primarily related to the TS content of reactive oxygen species (ROS), nicotine, and oxidative stress (OS) -driven inflammation. Current scientific opinion considers OS-mediated pathways to play a major role in the pathogenesis of these disorders, especially stroke. Preclinical studies (and preliminary data presented herein) have shown that nicotine (the principal e-liquid's ingredient) can cause OS, exacerbation of cerebral ischemia and secondary brain injury. Likewise, chronic e-Cig vaping could be prodromal to cerebrovascular impairment and promote cerebrovascular conditions that favor the onset of stroke and post- ischemic brain injury, suggested by our initial findings. The health impact of e-Cig vaping is currently unknown and the limited research and dearth of regulatory guidelines for the content of the vaping solution for e-Cigs (various harmful compounds including aldehydes, nitrosamines etc. have been detected in the e-Cig vapors) has become a critical public and regulatory concern we also want to address with this research. Further, we and others have found that TS promotes glucose intolerance and increases the risk of developing type-2 diabetes mellitus (2DM) with which it shares other pathogenic traits including the high risk of cerebrovascular and neurological disorders like stroke via ROS generation, inflammation, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) impairment. Recent in vitro findings and preliminary data from our group, supports an additive release pattern of angiogenic, oxidative and inflammatory factors by BBB endothelial cells in response to hyperglycemia (HG) and/or stroke conditions with comcomitant exposure to cigarette smoke extracts (CSE), thus suggesting the involvement of common pathogenic modulators of BBB impairment. To this end, metformin (MF; a widely prescribed, firstline anti-diabetic drug) before and after stroke injury has been shown to reduces stress and inhibits inflammatory responses 88. Recent preliminary data revealed that MF activates counteractive mechanisms which drastically reduce TS toxicity at the level of the BBB. These beneficial effects have been shown to be mediated by MF activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) 51. Our hypothesis is that excessive OS caused by TS and e- Cigs dysregulation of the cellular antioxidant response system is the linking underling mechanism prodromal to cerebrovascular toxicity and highten risk and/or severity of stroke In this respect we will: 1) Assess the potential cerebrovascular pathogenic impact of e-Cig vaping vs. TS through a side by side comparative study as per a recent call to action to investigate e-Cig toxicity by the regulatory agency and the Surgeon General; 2) Assess the molecular mechanisms (Nrf2/mitochondrial focused) driving TS-dependent impairment of the BBB and enhanced risk stroke and 3) Assess the viability and effectiveness of metformin (MF) to prevent/reduce TS and possibly e-Cig vaping-induced BBB damage and subsequent ischemic stroke injury. This is of outmost importance since chronic smoking carry high risks for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and stroke but care treatment(s) only begins upon clinical manifestation of a disease. For chronic smokers (including early stage former smokers for whom the risk of stroke is still very high) there are no prophylactic options available."
"9318515","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Overactive bladder is a highly prevalent condition, affecting approximately 33 million adults in the United States. Symptoms include frequency, urgency, urge incontinence, or nocturia. As bladder volume increases, involuntary contractions of the detrusor muscle are often associated with overactive bladder. The mechanisms underlying these involuntary contractions have not yet been fully elucidated. Despite the considerable impact this condition has on patients' quality of life, the pharmacological treatment of overactive bladder still remains controversial because of the adverse effects of commonly using anti-muscarinic agents. The purinergic- mediated responses can be another targeting for the treatment of detrusor over activity (DO). P2X receptors mediate contraction and P2Y receptors involve relaxation. P2X receptors are highly expressed in smooth muscle cells but limited expression of P2Y receptors. Thus, we hypothesize that purinergic relaxation might be mediated by activation of P2Y receptors in specialized cells.  P2Y receptors are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR). GPCR modulate the activity of ion channels. The activation of ion channels by P2Y receptors has not been explored in detrusor muscle. We will characterize the functional expression of P2Y receptors, the subsequent increase in intracellular Ca2+ and modulation of Ca2+- activated K+ channels which are involved in detrusor relaxation. Functional expression of small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (SK) channels in the detrusor muscle has been reported. However the current density of SK channels in detrusor smooth muscle cell was almost negligible at negative membrane potentials. We hypothesize that the expression and activation of SK channels in specialized cells within the detrusor wall are involved in the hyperpolarization and relaxation responses.  Recently, our lab reported that specific classes of interstitial cells exist in the bladder. These interstitial cells are identified using antibodies aainst platelet-derived growth factor receptor-? (PDGFR-?+). These cells were distributed throughout detrusor muscle, and were in close apposition with intramural nerve fibers. PDGFR-?+ cells have been described in the gastrointestinal tract and are implicated in purinergic inhibitory neurotransmission. We hypothesize that PDGFR-?+ cells have functional roles on the detrusor purinergic relaxation and abnormality of PDGFR-?+ cells induces DO.  In summary, we will characterize a novel population of cells that generate the purinergic inhibitory component of bladder neurotransmission. Isolation of PDGFR-?+ cells and functional study of PDGFR-?+  cells will allow more detailed understanding of purinergic neurotransmission and may reveal new targets for therapies to control detrusor motility. This information will open up important novel areas of investigation in urodynamics physiology and expand new venue of treatment of bladder over activity."
"9519209","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The U.S. Military is a high-risk population for tobacco use given their demographics (young, predominantly male, high minority prevalence), psychosocial risk factors (rebelliousness and risk-taking behaviors, high prevalence of alcohol abuse), stress of deployment, and targeted marketing by the tobacco industry. Currently, more than 30% of active duty military personnel use tobacco and that prevalence has been increasing since 1998. Military personnel are considered a highly vulnerable population. Advancing our understanding of the prevalence, incidence and diversity of tobacco product use in this population will improve scientific knowledge and inform FDA tobacco regulatory decision-making.  We were funded FDA supplemental funding to collect preliminary process and formative information as well as instrument validation in a small cohort of military personnel assessing traditional and new and emerging tobacco products. In the current application, we are proposing a logical extension of these efforts by expanding our assessment of new and emerging tobacco products, along with concomitant risk factors of tobacco use with a sufficient sample size to evaluate small, but clinically significant subgroup (e.g., gender, ethnicity) and tobacco type (e.g., e-cigarettes) differences. We will collect data on 30,000 Airmen, Air National Guard, and Reservists by administering surveys at three time-points (baseline, 1 year, 2 years) at the four active Technical Training Air Forces Bases (AFBs). To determine the optimal length of time between survey assessments, we will first conduct a pilot investigation to determine the reproducibility, feasibility, and amount of new information learned by evaluating participants Reservists every three months. Thus, the specific aims of the current study are to:  (1) Determine the prevalence and incidence of traditional tobacco products, new and emerging tobacco products, and multiple tobacco use behaviors; (2) Determine social cognitive (e.g., self-efficacy) and affective factors (e.g., perceptions, attitudes, beliefs) associated with the use of new and emerging tobacco products, ST, and little cigars; (3) Evaluate how marketing claims of reduced carcinogen exposure (e.g., switching from cigarettes to ST) influence perceptions and beliefs about risk and harm of different tobacco product use; (4) Assess the association between awareness of tobacco marketing strategies (e.g., free samples and price promotions), how they receive information about tobacco products, and tobacco use behaviors among Airmen; and (5) To directly compare tobacco initiation, resumption, and predictors of tobacco use between (a) Airmen (who remain active duty) with (b) National Guard/Reservists (who train and then return to civilian life). This will allow a direct comparison of those who remain in the military environment versus those who return to the civilian sectors."
"9340956","Project Summary Compounds from the pharmaceutical and other industries undergo safety and efficacy testing but the in vitro and animal models that are used often fail in their translation to human physiology, resulting in late stage failures during development and significant costs. There is a need to identify more physiologically relevant in vitro systems for both healthy and disease states that translates into the clinic. This need is especially pronounced for pharmaceutical and therapeutic compounds where the dearth of human safety data, particularly for preclinical evaluation of compounds, is largely attributable to inadequate in vitro systems that cannot accurately predict the effects of compound or drug exposures on relevant cells, tissues, and organs. There is a clear need for more life-like systems which incorporate 3D cellular architecture, fluid movement, and mimic in vivo compound dosing with non-linear compound and metabolite gradients that allow repeat low concentration dosing over time courses and amenable to running cell based assays. The scope of this SBIR project is to develop a first-in-class fluidics bio-tool that can promote highly functional 3D liver organoid formation, link multiple-organs and incorporate non-linear compound and metabolite gradients. The 3D organoid SciFlow system to be developed in this work will provide three major advances over current toxicological testing options: 1) Increased physiological relevance through promotion of 3D cellular architecture, and multi-organ systems, 2) Incorporation of non-linear exposure gradient of compounds and metabolites across multi-organ systems, and 3) a simple to use system with SBS-format and broad compatibility with standard laboratory equipment including high content imagers and plate readers. In Phase I, we will complete the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Characterize and select a non-binding surface chemistry to promote non-adherent cell culture and 3D spheroid formation. Aim 2: Establish a multi-organ system with 3D liver cell cultures capable of increased bioactivation (metabolism) of therapeutic compounds resulting in an increased drug potency on downstream tumor cells. Upon completion of the Phase I aims, our Phase II work will focus on validating the system and scaling the unit for production. Successful completion of this project will result in development of the SciSlick multi-organ 3D system, which will leverage the inter-compartment flow with the ability to culture different cell types, suitable for repeated dosing in long-term to investigate parent compound:metabolite complexities all in an easy to use, accessible microfluidics device."
"9324841","Abstract: Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS)  The Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS), called Protocol Review Committee (PRC) at the  University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute (UPCI) has responsibilities before and after trial activation. In the  narrative it will be referred to as PRC/PRMS. The specific aims of PRMS are to: 1) Provide scientific review of  clinical protocols before submission to the Institutional Review Board (IRB), 2) Monitor open clinical trials for  ongoing scientific merit and scientific progress, and 3) Close trials that fail to meet benchmarks for continued  scientific merit and timely accrual. Prior to trial activation, PRC/PRMS reviews each protocol for scientific  quality and priority. Once open, PRC/PRMS monitors each trial for ongoing scientific merit and progress. The  goal of Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) is to promote the highest scientific quality and ensure  efficient conduct of cancer clinical trials at UPCI and UPMC CancerCenter (UPMC CC). Clinical research is a  tightly coordinated activity at UPCI where Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM), the Data and  Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) and PRC/PRMS work in concert. Importantly, the PRC/PRMS role in  clinical research, to provide review and monitoring for scientific merit and progress, is distinct from the DSMC  responsibility to ensure protocol safety and data quality. The PRC/PRMS also works in conjunction with three  other parts of the clinical trials enterprise, the University of Pittsburgh IRB, the UPCI Biostatistics Facility, and  the UPCI Disease Center teams. PRC/PRMS includes four committees (Committees A, B, C, and E).  Committees A and B each meet once a month (off cycle) to provide coverage every 2 weeks to facilitate  prompt review of cancer treatment protocols. Committee reviews all biobehavioral, cancer epidemiology,  cancer prevention and control, and complementary medicine protocols as the need arises. Committee E was  established in April, 2014 to provide Electronic review of industry trials, selected by the UPCI Director and/or  Associate Director of Clinical Investigation, for expedited activation, for example, review of a study that uses a  novel agent that might benefit a patient at UPCI and is already open at other sites. Membership of the  PRC/PRMS includes a diverse group of cancer experts including medical, radiation, and surgical oncology,  pharmacology, biostatistics, nursing, regulatory affairs, and laboratory scientists. PRC/PRMS members are  appointed by the UPCI Director in consultation with the Associate Director for Clinical Investigation. The  PRC/PRMS evaluates each protocol for study design, scientific quality, and availability of patient and financial  resources required to complete the proposed trial. PRC/PRMS approval of cancer clinical trials is required  before the study can be submitted to the University of Pittsburgh IRB, NCI CIRB or other accredited IRB. Once  a trial is opened, the PRC/PRMS reviews for ongoing scientific merit and progress every six months. The  PRC/PRMS has the authority to suspend or close any study that fails to meet the scientific requirements.  Oversight for PRC/PRMS activities is provided by the UPCI Clinical Research Oversight Committee (CROC)."
"9381318","PROJECT SUMMARY The long-term goal of our research program is to define molecular mechanisms regulating chromatin modification signaling. We are particularly interested in understanding the complex relationship between DNA methylation and histone posttranslational modifications; two key epigenetic regulators of genome accessibility and function. Within this broad framework, we question 1) how are the writers and erasers of chromatin modifications regulated, 2) how do nuclear proteins and their complexes interface with (i.e., read) epigenetic marks to perform their chromatin regulatory functions, and 3) how does deregulation of chromatin signaling contribute to human disease? Our current studies are focused on UHRF1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is the cornerstone of a pathway responsible for maintaining a major portion of the DNA methylation found in mammalian cells. We recently showed that UHRF1 functions as a key regulator of DNA methylation inheritance through its interconnected reader and writer activities toward histone H3. While details of how UHRF1 performs its regulatory function are beginning to be uncovered, major gaps in knowledge exist in our basic molecular understanding of DNA methylation regulation and the role of UHRF1 in this process. Projects in the lab under this framework will question 1) how does UHRF1 interact with and modify chromatin, 2) what is the relationship between UHRF1, DNA methylation, and genome accessibility, 3) what is the role of histone ubiquitination in DNA methylation regulation, and 4) how does the structurally related protein UHRF2 regulate DNA methylation? Through a multidisciplinary and collaborative research program that leverages strengths in biochemical, biophysical, structural, genomic, proteomic, and cell-based studies of chromatin and epigenetic regulation, we hope to translate basic knowledge of epigenetic mechanism into therapeutic benefit."
"9315614","The primary objective of the UC Davis MIND Institute IDDRC Neurobehavioral Analysis Core (NAC) is to  help investigators generate detailed phenotypic characterizations of individuals with Intellectual and  Developmental Disabilities (IDD). Phenotypic characterization requires measures that are appropriate for a  representative sample of individuals with IDD and are designed, executed, and analyzed with the most  precision and fidelity possible. Existing standardized tests, rating scales, and checklists are often not adequate  for such characterization and adaptations of such measures or the creation of new measures are required.  Moreover, many measures are often applicable to only a very narrow segment of the IDD population of  interest. The NAC will assist IDDRC investigators in ensuring that they have the measures needed to generate  advanced biobehavioral characterizations that can stand alone, be used to assess environmental contributions  to IDD, or provide the evidence base for the development and evaluation of targeted treatments for IDD. To  achieve this objective, the NAC will draw on the interdisciplinary expertise and already developed measures of  several MIND Institute and UC Davis faculty and staff to provide key services for investigators conducting  neurobiological studies of cognition, emotion, language, and other aspects of brain and behavior in human  research participants with neurodevelopmental disorders that create IDD."
"9383906","Project Summary/Abstract Sepsis is the most common cause of mortality in many intensive care units and is responsible for more than 250,000 deaths in the United States annually. Microbial infection and trauma are the most common causes of sepsis. Sepsis is characterized by an exaggerated innate immune response leading to a cytokine storm. Recent studies suggest that activation of the innate immune cells causes vigorous metabolic changes towards increased glucose utilization. Elevated glucose metabolism is also a common feature in the initial state of sepsis. However, the role of glucose metabolism reprogramming in the regulation of innate immune function and its relevance to sepsis is poorly understood. In this Proposal, we aim to study the role of two individual glucose metabolism pathways in microbial sepsis, the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Our preliminary studies revealed essential roles of HBP-associated O- GlcNAc (O-linked ?-N-acetylglucosamine) signaling and PPP in antagonizing inflammatory response and bacterial spreading, respectively. We further identified nuclear factor E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) as a critical mediator of both HBP and PPP pathways. Therefore, promoting the activities of HBP and PPP pathways through pharmacological activation of Nrf2 may represent a promising therapeutic regimen for treating microbial sepsis. We hypothesize that 1) HBP-associated O-GlcNAc signaling inhibits the innate immune activation through O-GlcNAcylation of RIPK3 (receptor-interacting serine/threonine kinase 3); 2) PPP is required for macrophage bacterial killing and host survival in sepsis by mediating caspase-1 activation; 3) Genetic and pharmacological activation of these glucose metabolism pathways is effective in the treatment of microbial sepsis. Cecal ligation and puncture-induced polymicrobial sepsis model will be employed to examine the role and functions of glucose metabolism pathways. We will test whether dimethyl fumarate (DMF) treatment plays a protective role in sepsis-induced mortality. The goal of the proposal is to examine the function and mechanism of two glucose metabolism pathways on macrophage bacterial killing and inflammation, both of which are key determinants of host survival. Results of these studies will provide novel insights into the regulation and function of glucose metabolism signaling, which can potentially lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets in the treatment of microbial sepsis."
"9382043","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) is known to have a variable temporal course and a complex genetic basis that likely involves hundreds of loci. However, due to the lack of computational tools that can relate longitudinal markers of AD to genetic variation, our current knowledge about the genetic underpinnings of AD progression is very limited. To date, most genetic studies of AD are cross-sectional, which treat diagnosis, cognitive meas- urements, or neuroimaging biomarkers of AD as stationary. Yet, the pathophysiological process of AD is dy- namic and progressive, and individuals advance through disease stages at variable speeds. Existing genetic studies of longitudinal AD markers often involve only a smaller number of data points spanning a short period of time, which do not fully characterize the disease trajectory, or employ suboptimal statistical methods when handling serial measurements, which produces biased estimates and reduces statistical power. This project aims to systematically investigate the genetic basis of AD progression by analyzing longitudinal structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, neuropsychological assessments and genomic data from two large- scale independently funded studies: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS). Innovative statistical methods will be developed and implemented to integrate high- dimensional genomic data and longitudinal markers of AD (on average ~5 time points per subject spanning 3+ years) that exhibit serial dependence within subjects, missing data points, drop-outs and irregularly spaced measurements across subjects. This project will offer critical analysis tools to model the trajectories of cogni- tive decline and change in AD biomarkers over time, and dissect the genetic basis of AD progression. The pro- ject will build on Dr. Ge's strong quantitative background and prior experience in neuroimaging statistics and imaging genetics. During the award period, Dr. Ge will receive formal training in statistical genetics and ge- nomics, and cognitive aging and AD, which will help him develop into an independent investigator and launch a multidisciplinary research program at the intersection of imaging sciences, genomics, statistics and Alzheimer's research."
"9358015","Immune function is highly dependent upon costimulatory signals where their role has become apparent in the study of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes; expression of PD-L1 can engage PD-1 leading to T cell dysfunction with unchecked tumor growth. Similarly, there is a central role of T cell costimulatory signals in autoimmune disease particularly with activation of autoreactive T cells and induction of epitope spreading which has become evident with the emergence of autoimmune toxicities after blockade of coinhibitory signals in patients with cancer. Moreover, genetic variants identified in the costimulatory receptor CD226, and its ligand CD155 (shared with TIGIT) are strongly associated with risk of MS, indicating that this pathway maybe central in MS autoimmunity. These studies have led us to more deeply examine the TIGIT/CD226/CD155 and PD-1/PD-L1 pathways in autoimmunity versus their opposing roles in cancer followed with building regulatory networks in T cells by first analyzing interactions between these costimulatory pathways pairwise and then integrating co-stimulatory/co- inhibitory T cell signals. The uniqueness of this grant resides in 3 areas: 1) in vitro and in vivo model systems to evaluate costimulation in autoimmune disease; 2) availability of unique reagents to inhibit costimulation; and 3) PPG investigators to translate basic research to the clinic. In Project 1, we will examine the role of TIGIT/CD226 pathway in regulating T cell responses, investigating the hypothesis that TIGIT has dual roles in regulating T cell responses, cooperating with other co-inhibitory molecules to regulate effector T cell and Treg responses. We will dissect the roles of TIGIT in effector T cells and Treg in experimental inflammatory conditions. In Project 2, we hypothesize that loss of TIGIT expression or function in MS drives autoimmune responses, while in tumors, increased TIGIT expression or signaling allows tumors to escape immune surveillance. We will determine the role of TIGIT/CD226 in regulating CD4+ T cell activation in human inflammatory disorders. Secondly, we will investigate the role of TIGIT/CD226 on the function of Treg populations in MS, hypothesizing there are defects in the function of TIGIT+ Tregs in MS patients inducing dysfunctional Th1-like Tregs. In Project 3, we will use an integrative approach to understand mechanisms of costimulation. Our goal is to define genetic circuits underlying interactions between the costimulatory coinhibitory receptors PD-1 and TIGIT. We will determine how these costimulatory and coinhibitory receptors interact to regulate CD4+ T cell functions, and from that infer a transcriptional network mediating T cell function. Finally, we will test the roles of candidate regulators in the network underlying the activities of co-stimulators and co-inhibitors in CD4+ T cells. These studies will provide mechanistic insights into how TIGIT and PD1 exert their critical immunoregulatory functions in regulating T cell tolerance and autoimmunity. Understanding mechanisms inducing blockade of co-inhibitory signals that have had such dramatic effects in treating cancer may provide insight into therapeutic approaches for blocking co-stimulatory signaling in autoimmune diseases."
"9322601","DESCRIPTION: A working group commissioned by the Office of AIDS Research of the NIH identified multi-morbidity, functioning, impacts of anti-retroviral therapy (ART), immune senescence, inflammation and a focus on women caregivers among the areas where critical needs for research exist. One of the major limitations identified by the working group, was the lack of appropriate comparison populations in existing studies, thereby limiting the inferences from data collected on older adults in Western populations due to different exposures and risk behavior. The need to leverage and build on existing cohorts was emphasized. The proposed study addresses many of these issues. The World Health Organization's Study on Global AGEing and Adult Health (SAGE), in its Well-Being of Older People Study (WOPS) sub-study, is currently collecting data on a cohort of about 1300 community dwelling respondents older adults in two low-income rural/periurban settings in sub-Saharan Africa (Uganda and South Africa) to understand the direct and indirect impact of HIV/AIDS on older adults. Half the respondents are HIV- positive and of these about half are currently on ART. The other half of the cohort is HIV- negative, but have been indirectly affected by HIV/AIDS in their families. A control cohort is included in Uganda, with older adults neither infected nor affected by HIV or AIDS. The cohort will already have been interviewed twice before the start of this proposal and with funding from this grant, will provide data for a seven year period over the full course of the study - the longet community dwelling cohort of older adults infected and/or affected by HIV, with a comparable cohort of older adults living in the same areas without HIV. Comprehensive measures of health and the inclusion of an array of biomarkers, including those of immune function and the ageing process, provide an unprecedented opportunity to study the complex nature of HV/AIDS in two non- clinical African populations (South Africa and Uganda). Data from the proposed study will have direct implications for understanding the health and well-being of similar older adult populations with HIV/AIDS in the US, especially those from lower socioeconomic classes and minority populations. Data from the study will use measures that are comparable to other international studies of aging, including SAGE and the US Health and Retirement family of studies. All anonymized microdata from the study will be archived according to international standards along with all metadata and made available to researchers."
"9381421","Project Summary This proposal seeks competitive renewal of a multi-PI project (Fu and Yeo), which aims to use global approaches to elucidate the regulatory principles of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) in mammalian genomes. Built upon our accomplishments in the past funding cycle, we propose to leverage the powerful experimental and computational tools we have developed to pursue four specific aims. In Aim 1, we will couple gain- and lost-of-function multi-target screens to deduce regulatory pathways at both splicing and polyadenylation levels. We will focus on determining the specific function of different RNA polymerase II (Pol II) subunits, rather than by the Pol II CTD alone, in the recruitment of RNA processing machineries for co-transcriptional RNA processing. In Aim 2, we will develop a general strategy for systematic identification of chromatin-associated RBPs to determine direct contribution of some RBPs to transcription and co-transcriptional RNA processing reactions. We will concentrate our efforts in dissecting a potential new pathway in epigenetic control of alternative splicing as well as broader roles of specific RBPs in direct transcriptional control. In Aim 3, we will use a novel strategy for identification and characterization of non-canonical RBPs. Focusing on a large number of newly identified finger zinc (Znf) proteins, we propose to determine their roles in binding to both DNA and RNA and deduce their transcriptome-wide interactions with RNA. We also propose to pursue a specific paradigm in this aim on a newly identified RBP known to associate with the nuclear pore to determine its role in selective mRNA nuclear export, which is pertinent to an ALS-regulated disease pathology. Combined, we believe that this comprehensive, interconnected, and hypothesis-driven research plan will greatly advance our understanding of regulated RNA processing and associated disease mechanisms."
"9469009","PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT  Speech perception is one of the most remarkable achievements of the human brain, but how the brain extracts meaning from a speech signal is still poorly understood. During speech perception, the speech we hear is influenced by sensory input from our eyes and skin. For example, viewing the face of a speaker improves speech intelligibility. Feeling the lips and jaws of a speaker alters the perception of heard speech. Amazingly, individuals can be trained perceive speech through their sense of touch in the absence of auditory input. There is a long history of research on the communication of speech through the somatosensory system, dating back to 1924. Remarkably, no previous study has investigated the neural mechanisms of speech perception in the somatosensory system. The goal of this study is to determine how the brain learns to perceive speech through the sense of touch. The knowledge gained will inform current theories of auditory and visual speech perception, as well as cross-modal plasticity. This project will also inform the design of tactile speech prostheses that can serve as alternatives for patients with auditory nerve damage who cannot receive cochlear implants.  In this study, participants will be trained to perceive vibrotactile speech: tactile patterns generated from recordings of spoken syllables. Behavioral experiments combined with advanced electroencephalography (EEG) techniques will be used to test the following hypotheses: 1) the learning of vibrotactile stimuli derived from speech constitutes genuine speech perception, and 2) the superior temporal gyrus, a key region involved in auditory speech perception, will acquire selectivity for vibrotactile speech after training.  One hallmark of speech perception is the ability to recombine speech units to accurately perceive new stimuli. Therefore, participants will be tested on their ability to successfully generalize to untrained speech stimuli. Multisensory integration is also an important feature of speech perception: visual and auditory speech are effortlessly integrated in the brain to enhance perception. An enhancement of visual speech perception by simultaneously presented vibrotactile speech would provide further evidence that vibrotactile stimuli are learned as speech. To test the hypothesis that visual and vibrotactile speech is perceptually integrated, participants will be tested on their ability to identify visual-only and visual- vibrotactile speech.  To determine how vibrotactile speech is learned and represented by the brain, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) and representation similarity analysis (RSA) will be used. MVPA and RSA are statistical techniques used in cognitive neuroscience to test hypotheses about how physical stimuli are represented in the brain. Pilot data demonstrates the feasibility of successfully decoding auditory speech and vibrotactile stimuli from EEG data using MVPA and RSA. These techniques will be used to test the hypothesis that vibrotactile speech is encoded in the superior temporal gyrus. Overall, this project will provide insights into speech learning in the somatosensory system, addressing the fundamental question about how speech perception is accomplished by the human brain."
"9325092","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA molecules are secreted in extracellular spaces (exRNAs) and act as endocrine signals altering the phenotypes of cancer cells. In this application we will focus on the class of small non-codingRNAs named microRNAs. We propose an innovative therapeutic concept: the depletion of oncogenic microRNAs from malignant cells by enhancing their secretion as exRNAs or blocking suppressor microRNAs' delivery in extracellular space by blocking secretion mechanisms. Our main goal is to develop new strategies using combined miRNA and siRNA to maximize therapeutic benefit by affecting the production of exRNAs. Our proposal centers on the identification and targeting of specific tumor-derived exRNA and exosomes leading to novel therapies and improved therapeutic outcomes. In UH2 phase of the grant, using ovarian cancer (OC) cell lines and cells derived from OC patient tumors, we will identify novel exRNA-based cancer therapeutic lead candidates by siRNA library genome-wide screening based on secretion measurements, by small RNA deep sequencing in paired samples from tumors, plasma and ascites from the same patient, and by functional studies for the lead exRNA candidates. In the UH3 phase, we will achieve pre-clinical optimization by testing the exRNA lead(s) identified in the UH2 for antitumor efficacy in well-established OC murine orthotopic models and their safety using well-established preclinical protocols. The aims in exploratory UH2 phase are designed to identify and validate the function of novel exRNA therapeutic candidates for pre- clinical studies. In UH3 phase, we will formulate the methods for the validation of the assays to determine the activity, pharmacology in tissue and plasma to establish dosage schedules in animal models for the design of rational anti-tumor approaches. Using our nanoliposomal delivery technology, we will also conduct target modulation and efficacy studies to generate clear evidence regarding the safety of exRNA-based therapeutic candidates in the proposed dose range. Our approach, by using a new category of regulatory exRNAs- miRNAs, could substantially enhance therapeutic efficacy for cancer treatment. We will also demonstrate, for the first time, the use of nanoliposome-siRNA-exRNA targeting to generate a synergistic boosting effect for treatment of cancers. While we are focusing on OC due to the high mortality associated with this malignancy, our findings have applications for any type of cancer. This proposal brings synergistic capabilities of scientists working for over a decade in the fields of miRNA (Dr. Calin), siRNA (Dr. Sood), nanoparticle delivery (Dr. Lopez-Berestein), and exosome biology (Dr. O'Halloran). The team has the expertise and synergistic drive to achieve novel exRNA therapeutic development by performing highly innovative research, and has developed RNA-based therapies in the past."
"9355417","ABSTRACT Dysphagia (disordered swallowing) causes nearly 150,000 annual hospitalizations and over 220,000 additional hospital days, and prolongs hospital lengths of stay by 40%. Dysphagia risk is typically identified through subjective screening methods and those identified through screening undergo gold standard imaging testing such as videofluoroscopy (VF). However, screening methods over- or underestimate risk, and completely fail to identify patients with silent dysphagia (e.g., silent aspiration) that can cause pneumonia and other adverse events. Pre-emptive detection of silent or near-silent aspiration is essential. The long term goal is to develop an instrumental dysphagia screening approach based on high-resolution cervical auscultation (HRCA) in order to early predict dysphagia-related adverse events, and initiate intervention measures to mitigate them. The overall objective here is to develop accurate, advanced data analysis approaches to translate HRCA signals to swallowing events observed in VF images. Our strong preliminary data has led us to our central hypothesis: advanced data analytics tools are suitable approaches for the analysis of HRCA in order to automate dysphagia screening. The rationale is that a reliable, robust early-warning instrumental dysphagia screening approach will reduce adverse events in patients with silent aspiration/dysphagia, shorten length of stay and improve overall clinical outcomes. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will pursue the following three specific aims: (1) develop machine learning algorithms to differentiate HRCA signals produced by swallowing physiologic events from similar, non-swallow related signals produced during swallowing; (2) translate HRCA swallowing-signal signatures to actual swallow physiologic events to detect abnormal swallowing physiology; and (3) discriminate normal from abnormal airway protection and swallow physiology via machine-learning analysis of HRCA signals with similar accuracy as VF. Under the first aim, a machine learning approach will be used to detect pharyngeal swallowing events and differentiate them from speech, cough and other non- swallow events, with 90% accuracy, when compared to a human expert?s interpretation of our VF data sets. Under the second aim, objective swallowing physiology observations from VF will be matched to swallowing events observed with HRCA in order to show that abnormal swallow physiology and airway protection will produce distinctive HRCA signal signatures that predict the same events identified with VF. Under the third aim, analytical algorithms will be used to detect signs of disordered airway protection in HRCA signal signatures with 90% accuracy when compared to a human expert?s airway protection ratings from VF images. The approach is innovative, as it will produce analysis tools that will infer about dysphagia and aspiration based on the analysis of HRCA with unprecedented accuracy, before patients are placed in harm?s way. Our work is significant, because it will translate to an early-warning HRCA screening tool that predicts dysphagia- related adverse events in asymptomatic patients reducing medical adverse events, and length of stay."
"9316827","Project Summary  GI colonization with C. albicans is common for humans and generally does not have adverse effects on human health. However, if a patient becomes immunocompromised, colonizing C. albicans cells can escape the GI tract, reach the blood stream and cause disseminated, life-threatening disease. GI colonization is therefore significant because disease-causing fungal cells arise from the populations that colonize the host as harmless commensals. The goal of this research project is to develop a dietary intervention that reduces GI colonization with Candida. The project is based on preliminary results that demonstrate the ability of diets high in medium chain triglycerides to reduce GI colonization by C. albicans in mice. The long-term goal of this project is to reduce the incidence of candidemia and candidiasis by reducing the level of colonizing Candida in patients who are at high risk.  In Specific Aim 1, the goal is to test the hypothesis that a modified diet will reduce the level of Candida gut colonization in preterm infants, a population that is at risk for developing systemic Candida infection.  The focus of Specific Aim 2 is to identify changes that occur in microbiota composition as a consequence of dietary change and to determine whether the colonizing Candida strains change during the administration of the modified diet.  These studies may lead to the development of a dietary method for decreasing Candida gut colonization. The diet may reduce the incidence of invasive candidiasis in hospitalized patients across the life cycle who are at high risk for disease."
"9379700","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This career development award will establish Dr. Oanh Nguyen as a clinician-investigator focused on designing, implementing, and evaluating transitional care interventions to improve health outcomes for vulnerable patients with cardiovascular illness. This award will provide support needed to develop her expertise in: 1) advanced methods in patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR); 2) social determinants of health; and 3) intervention development, implementation, and evaluation in real-world health settings. To achieve these goals, Dr. Nguyen has assembled an expert mentorship team. Her primary mentor, Ethan Halm, MD, MPH, has extensive experience in health services research, PCOR, predictive modeling, intervention development, and training and mentoring faculty. Her co-mentor, Simon Lee, PhD is a medical anthropologist with expertise in qualitative methods, PCOR, and implementation science. Additional scientific advisors include Song Zhang, PhD, an expert in advanced biostatistics and predictive modeling techniques; and Sandeep Das, MD, an expert in implementation and evaluation of evidence-based cardiovascular care delivery interventions.  Readmission within 30 days of hospitalization occurs in up to 1 in 5 adults, and patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) and ischemic heart disease (IHD) are among those at highest risk. Despite federal financial `readmissions penalties' for cardiovascular and other conditions, the most effective strategy to prevent readmissions remains unknown. Current interventions focus on improving medical care processes, but do not address deeper social vulnerabilities such as food and housing insecurity or behavioral health needs associated with higher readmission risk. Informed by her clinical experience and preliminary studies, Dr. Nguyen will conduct a series of studies to: 1) develop predictive models to identify hospitalized patients with CHF and IHD at high risk for readmission, and to stratify individuals by medical severity and social vulnerabilities (Aim 1); 2) conduct qualitative interviews of high-risk patients to understand patient perspectives on how social vulnerabilities affect medical recovery from CHF and IHD, and on the acceptability of community- based interventions to address these vulnerabilities (Aim 2); and 3) develop, pilot, and assess the feasibility of a transitional care intervention enhanced to address social vulnerabilities in addition to traditional medical needs (Aim 3), incorporating an innovative social-health information exchange (Dallas Information Exchange Portal). This research plan leverages existing institutional resources, including Dr. Halm's AHRQ-funded UT Southwestern (UTSW) Center for PCOR; the UTSW CTSA; and novel information technology. This training and research will form the basis for an R01 application for a fully powered randomized controlled trial to assess the impact of a risk-stratified readmission prevention strategy that addresses both social and medical vulnerabilities to prevent readmissions and improve health outcomes in CHF and IHD."
"9304362","The Core A (Administrative Core) is a large core that comprises sub-groups of administration, distinct resources of human materials, and data analyses/database construction. For efficient and central operation of the overall center, we have integrated these distinct components under the leadership of Core A PI, who also serves as the center director. This Core has three major aims: administrative leadership, organization of human bio-resources, and data organization/database maintenance. In Aim 1, this Core will lead financial administration, organization of human and animal subject protocols, and coordination of research meetings and annual retreat inside this Center. This Core will provide scientific leadership to the entire Center by centrally organizing scientific issues towards uniform conclusions inside the Center, and coordinating collaborative research and material exchange with investigators outside the Center. This Core will maintain the web page of the P50 Conte center, organize education and outreach plans. Lastly, this Core will lead the Center in research rigor and integrity and make sure the members to observe data/resource sharing policies. In Aim 2, this Core will organize and provide the center investigators with several types of established human resources, including three case-control sample sets for genetic study, the datasets of RNA-sequencing from human brains, blood from two prospective cohort samples, and human induced pluripotent stem cells. In Aim 3, this Core will continue development of a database in which the multiple types of data obtained in Projects will be systematically stored to support investigators for data sharing, analysis, and preservation. This is also a basis of data and resource sharing within the scientific community as well as public outreach. In summary, believe that this Core will continuously play a key role by providing the central service in administrative coordination, organization of human bio-resources, and data management/database maintenance. This core will lead research rigor and integrity on behalf of the Center. We will emphasize educational and public outreach plans, according to the successful protocol that we have built in the current P50."
"9344614","Project Summary The mission of the Washington University Center for Diabetes Translation Research (WU-CDTR) is to eliminate disparities in diabetes by translating, disseminating, implementing, and sustaining evidence-based research findings into real-world settings. The WU-CDTR is located at an outstanding institution that continues as the intellectual home to an exceptional group of investigators conducting rigorous translational research focused around two interacting scientific themes: (1) the root causes of diabetes disparities, and (2) the prevention of obesity as a major contributing cause of Type 2 diabetes. The WU-CDTR has evolved to become a ?network of networks?, with investigators affiliated through a regional resource core with the University of Missouri at Columbia, and two health disparity population cores with the National Congress of American Indians, and the African American Collaborative Obesity Research Network. The WU-CDTR fosters transdisciplinary collaborations, catalyzes new ideas, and supports investigators through six research cores led by national experts in their respective fields that provide distinctive but complementary scientific expertise to inform research with populations at risk for disparities, including: (1) the Dissemination and Implementation in Diabetes Research Core, which advances the study of dissemination and implementation science in diabetes research; (2) the Policy and Systems Science Analysis in Diabetes Research Core, which advances the study of policy- and system-level interventions in diabetes research; (3) the Health Communication and Health Literacy Core, which advances the study of health communication science to test strategies for addressing health disparities in diabetes research; (4) the Health Informatics in Diabetes Research Core, which advances the development and application of healthcare informatics in translational diabetes research; (5) the Research Partnerships with American Indian/Alaska Native Communities Core, which increases the capacity of researchers to engage in translational research with American Indian and Alaska Native communities; and (6) the Solutions to Diabetes in Black Americans Core, which provides methodological and content expertise to support research with the Black population. The WU-CDTR supports a vibrant Pilot and Feasibility Program designed to attract and retain new investigators as well as established investigators new to the field; and it also supports an Enrichment Program that promotes transdisciplinary research, learning opportunities, and mentorship for young investigators. Evidence that the WU-CDTR has been successful in pursuing the mission includes a record of outstanding productivity reflected by publications and funding in diabetes and related research. Success is also measured by the growth of our research base of established and new diabetes investigators, and underrepresented racial minority investigators. The WU-CDTR is positioned as the nexus for transdisciplinary team science and transformative diabetes research addressing multiple dimensions of diabetes disparities."
"9536335","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project is an evaluation of a novel device, the Air Barrier System (ABS), to reduce the risk of prosthesis- related surgical site infection in a multi-center clinical trial. The ABS shields surgical incisions intra-operatively by creating a field of high-purity air surrounding an incision that prevents airborne microorganisms from entering the incision. Preliminary findings in the ongoing NIH/SBIR Phase II study, after enrolling 258 patients in a single-site trial at the DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) in Houston, indicate a positive trend for the ABS to reduce the clinical incidence of prosthesis-related infection in hip replacement, posterior spinal fusion, and prosthetic vascular graft procedures. Furthermore, preliminary data trends indicate that higher levels of airborne microorganisms in surgical theatres are correlated to an increased incidence of prosthesis-related infections and that the ABS significantly reduces the presence of these organisms during surgical procedures. Nimbic Systems has formed a consortium with researchers and surgeons at Baylor College of Medicine (VAMC and Ben Taub General hospitals) in Houston and University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (Texas Department of Criminal Justice Hospital). These institutions were selected specifically because the reported infection rates in the targeted surgical procedures are high; they perform a broad range of surgical services and can provide adequate enrollment volume; and patient follow-up compliance is high. Research performed will include participation by both Nimbic employees and consortium contributors. This Phase IIB research will evaluate ABS performance in a prospective, randomized, blinded multi-center trial expanded to 816 surgical cases. The surgical procedures studied will include total hip arthroplasty, trauma- related acetabula reconstruction, posterior instrumented spine fusion, and prosthetic vascular graft procedures. Patients will be enrolled during the first two years of the study, and CDC guidelines require a one year follow- up period to monitor patients for potential prosthesis-related infections. The project's key aims are to: (1) compare the incidence of implant-related infections between the control and ABS groups, (2) determine whether increased levels of airborne microorganisms in surgical theatres are correlated to an increase in the incidence of surgical site infections, (3) determine if a risk-assessment model can be constructed to predict the incidence of infection based on airborne CFU levels, (4) evaluate user satisfaction with the ABS device and develop device improvements."
"9236106","Abstract The sigma-1 receptor is an enigmatic transmembrane receptor in humans that has been implicated in a variety of disease processes, including neurodegenerative disease and heart failure. Recently, the sigma receptor has been identified as a regulator of ion channel and GPCR signaling. Despite the growing recognition of the importance of this protein, very little is known regarding the molecular basis for its activity or its contribution to disease. We will study the sigma receptor using a multifaceted approach to examine structure, pharmacology, and dynamics of this important protein. Initial efforts will focus on the use of X-ray crystallography to probe receptor activation mechanism using conformationally selective antibody fragments. Complementing this work, we will explore the role of oligomerization in sigma receptor function using electron microscopy and other methods, and we will characterize the structural dynamics of the receptor by NMR spectroscopy and computational simulations. In the long term, we aim to establish a detailed molecular understanding of the sigma receptor activity and its role in human health and disease."
"9410896","Project Summary The first inclination of public health researchers responding to the call for increasing use of PrEP among populations at high risk for HIV is to focus on research and interventions that target patients in those populations. However, this is only partially addresses the problem. Patients who seek PrEP from their physicians will only be successful if their care providers know about and are willing to prescribe PrEP. That is to say, we cannot increase PrEP utilization in high risk populations unless PrEP is accessible and available to them. Thus, our focus in this R34 is on care providers. We propose to develop a novel tool that uses medical claims data to infer physician networks and then use those networks to determine how to best implement targeted interventions to encourage primary care providers to offer Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis to their patients at risk for HIV. This will increase access and availability of the treatment, thereby increasing the likelihood of uptake and adherence, critical for strengthening the clinical impact of this highly effective treatment modality. We will use regression models that incorporate data gleaned from the probabilistic physician network we create from claims data to explore whether PrEP prescribing clusters by local physician subnetwork, is associated with connections to infectious disease specialists, or to geographic variation related to features of the HIV epidemic, such as stigma. These models, adjusted for social network statistical dependencies, will help us operationalize and understand the relative contribution of three alternative processes: social influence among physicians, social learning (physician education and diffusion of information), and non-network geographic variation. The results of these analyses will guide identification of appropriate intervention targets for education campaigns by Gilead or interested third parties and identification of possible physician ?change agents? for peer-based interventions based on social learning and social influence processes. Physician targeting tools will be designed and tested based on these findings via simulations on the network we create and via direct contact with a small group of physicians we have identified as targets and change agents."
"9451116","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 30% of all incurable lung adenocarcinomas have a KRAS mutation and, despite the impressive advances in targeted therapies over past several years, no approved or highly effective targeted therapy exists for this subset of lung cancers. Recently, we have used comprehensive approaches, including interrogation of genetically-engineered mouse models (GEMMs), to examine the efficacy of novel therapeutic strategies for KRAS-mutant lung cancers. For example, 2 promising treatments are the combination of PI3K inhibitors with MEK inhibitors and docetaxel with MEK inhibitors, both which have activity in KRAS-mutant lung cancers. However, these approaches are not effective in the subset of KRAS-mutant cancers with concomitant loss of LKB1 (kinase that phosphorylates AMPK), suggesting these cancers may require unique targeted therapies. We found that, while Kras/p53-mutant cancers - which are susceptible to these therapies - had strong activation of MEK-ERK pathway, the resistant Kras/Lkb1-mutant lung cancers had strikingly minimal engagement of this pathway. This finding provides mechanistic insight to the primary resistance of Kras/Lkb1 lung cancers to combination therapies with MEK inhibitors. However, recent findings suggest that cancers with LKB1 deficiency have altered metabolic wiring that could potentially be exploited by targeted therapy approaches that would be specifically effective in this subset of cancers. We will accelerate our research to tackle the problem of KRAS-mutant lung cancers. We aim to identify potent, tolerable therapies that will target KRAS-mutant lung cancers both with/without intact LKB1. We have used genome-wide genetic screens, metabolic profiling, and kinase inhibitor screens to identify promising therapeutic strategies for LKB1-deficient and -intact KRAS-mutant lung cancers. In particular, we developed a novel screen to identify targets that specifically combine with MEK inhibitors for KRAS-mutant lung cancers, and have already validated one, an MEK and BCL-XL inhibitor combination, that demonstrated impressive activity in genetically-engineered mouse models and xenografts. Since MEK inhibitor-based regimens may not be effective against LKB1 deficient cancers, we developed a novel screen to identify targets whose inhibition is specifically toxic to LKB1-mutant cancers, and validated 2 potential targets, DTYMK and CHEK1, that regulate pyrimidine metabolism and DNA damage response, respectively. We seek to comprehensively develop these potential therapeutic targets in vivo using GEMMs and primary human lung cancer explant xenografts to prepare for clinical implementation of new therapeutic approaches. Further, we will interrogate hundreds of human KRAS-mutant lung cancer specimens to determine if features distinguishing Lkb1-intact and -mutant cancers in the genetically- engineered mouse models are also observed in their human counterparts. We are confident that successful implementation of the aims will yield important mechanistic insights into the signal transduction and metabolic wiring of the various subtypes of KRAS-mutant lung cancers and lead to development of therapeutics that specifically target each subset."

"9414856","ABSTRACT  While acute stroke is a leading cause of human death and disability in the United States, unfortunately, clinical therapies for stroke are limited and unsatisfactory. The overwhelming failures of stroke treatments in clinical trials strongly indicate that, to battle this multifaceted brain disorder, novel strategies that target multiple cell types and afford different mechanisms of protection are needed to achieve positive therapeutic effects. One strategy, mechanical induction of mild hypothermia (defined as a 1-5oC decrease in body temperature), has shown remarkable neuroprotective effects against brain ischemia in both animal and human studies. At this time, however, available physical cooling techniques are ineffectual and usually impractical. A more recent focus has been to identify pharmacological compounds that can be used to induce hypothermia. In theory, pharmacologically induced hypothermia (PIH) can be initiated much earlier after the stroke event and in the absence of mechanical cooling. Even a small (1-2oC) decrease in body temperature during early hours after stroke prevents detrimental post-stroke hyperthermia, while mild hypothermia (2-5oC reduction) decreases the extent of ischemic injury. In our Phase I and Phase II investigations, we demonstrated that rapid and reproducible hypothermia is induced by several novel neurotensin receptor 1 (NTR1) agonists, resulting in significant neuroprotection against brain damage induced by ischemic stroke, hemorrhage stroke, or traumatic brain injury (TBI) in rodent models. The key breakthrough is that the NTR1 agonists do not induce shivering in the subject animals, the major problem associated with other agents that mechanically or pharmacologically induce hypothermia. The NTR1 compounds also act synergistically with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), the only FDA-approved thrombolytic treatment at this time. During Phases I and II, we also demonstrated hypothermia induction by our leads in non-human primates, and completed a number of IND-enabling tasks with satisfactory outcomes. For this Phase IIb study, in Specific Aim 1, we will continue to study the hypothermic effect of our compounds in monkeys, with the overall opportunity of providing a clear bridge between rodent, non-human primates, and human clinical studies. In particular, we will demonstrate the stroke protection synergism between tPA and our NTR1 agonists, as was previously demonstrated in rodents. In Specific Aim 2, required IND-enabling preclinical evaluations will be completed, while in Specific Aim 3, we will commission 28-day toxicity studies in two species (rat and dog), which also are necessary for IND preparation. Finally, in Specific Aim 4, we will prepare and submit the IND. When these four Specific Aims are completed satisfactorily, our lead will be ready to enter human clinical trials, which will serve as a major value influx point for seeking further funding to support the program."

"9407138","A growing number of studies have demonstrated that combinatorial approaches are providing a path for personalization of strategies to treat a wide array of disease states. While providing a promising path to revolutionize medicine, the evolution of personalized, minimally invasive, combinatorial therapies has been slowed as a result of technological limitations. As such, there is a pressing need for designing new devices to facilitate the development of paradigm changing, minimally invasive, approaches to treat diseased tissues in situ which enable trans-disciplinary strategies to combat disease. This Phase 2 project, which builds upon the success of the completed Phase 1, is designed to address this need through the development of a next generation flexible endoscopic compatible ablation catheter platform (FrostBite) for the treatment of various gastrointestinal cancers including pancreatic and liver cancer. This multi-functional platform will enable the application of multiple therapeutic and diagnostic approaches (pharmaceutical, ablation, among others) in a single device format which when combined with novel vitamin D3 analogs designed to increase the lethality of freezing, will provide for an enhanced treatment option for numerous cancers. The ability to deliver multi-parametric treatment regimens of the FrostBite catheter is enhanced by the incorporation of a novel deployable thermosensor to monitor ablation zone formation in real time. This, when combined with advanced imaging approach compatibility, including endoscopic ultrasound, MRI, and CT, will provide for unmatched control and visualization during a procedure. Phase 1 activities yielded a prototype 1.27mm needle tip catheter capable of delivering cryothermal insults to a target within 10 seconds creating a zone of destruction of ~2.5cm in less than 3 mins. Studies into combinatorial drug/thermal insults also demonstrated improved outcomes in tissue models. This Phase 2 is designed to 1) miniaturize and test the next generation endoscopic compatible cryocatheter, 2) integrate a novel in situ deployable multipoint thermal sensor to enable real time monitoring of the thermal profile of the target during ablation, 3) develop and evaluate a series of vitamin D3 analogs (commercial and novel), and test the optimal combination device and analog protocol in an ex vivo engineered tumor model and in in vivo studies. This project builds upon successful P1 studies, as well as others, and leverages the combined expertise of researchers from CPSI, University of Ottawa, Binghamton University, and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine to develop a new surgical device and adjunctive drug combination approach to more effectively treat cancers of the liver and pancreas. Once completed, this project will provide for an effective, minimally invasive treatment option for individuals suffering from these and other gastroenterological based cancers such as colorectal, stomach and esophageal cancer. Successful completion of this project will provide for a novel medical device enabling the development and application of advanced personalized treatment regimes for 100?s of thousands of patients who suffer from numerous gastrointestinal tissue disease states which are untreatable or inadequately treated with today?s state of the art devices yielding improved patient survival and quality of life."

This will be achieved through the provision of consultative advice on drug development, a patient registry network for clinical trials recruitment, resources and services for conducting clinical trials, and a searchable integrated clinical data repository for observational research. Aim 1 of the Core will provide consultative services for drug discovery and development projects. For this aim, a group of experts in drug development, preclinical testing and clinical care of PKD patients will provide consultative advice on development of PKD therapeutics starting with the identification of a candidate molecule and with the endpoint being a first-in-human clinical trial. Aim 2 of the Core will develop a searchable registry of PKD patient volunteers for clinical trials recruitment. The Core will build a registry of patients willing to be contacted for clinical trials recruitment. This will greatly facilitate assessment of feasibility of trials, development of research protocols, and will enable rapid start-up once a trial is activated. Aim 3 of the Core will provide services and resources to conduct clinical trials. The Core will provide a one-stop shop where all the resources needed to conduct a PKD clinical trial will be provided including clinic rooms, research coordinators, clinical and research laboratory testing, nutritional advice, and guidance with trial design. Aim 4 will build a user-friendly, data-rich observational PKD cohort database. The Core will create an observational database from the entire cohort of patients with PKD that is followed at KUMC. Data from their electronic health records and other sources are imported into the Healthcare Enterprise Repository for Ontological Narration (HERON), an i2b2-based platform.

"9319334","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Crucial to controlling movements is our bodies' sense of limb state arising from mechanically gated neurons located within the musculotendon, called proprioceptors. Understanding the mechanical encoding of proprioceptors is critical to understanding their roles in sensorimotor behaviors such as balance control. Proprioceptive loss due to aging, diabetes, as well as chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) and other disorders can increase the risk for falls, which is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults. Neuromechanical models are essential for predicting the impact of sensory loss on movement because proprioceptors are difficult to access and measure from during actual movements. Here, the goal is to develop a parsimonious model of proprioceptive function appropriate for predictive modeling of sensorimotor control in healthy and neuropathic conditions. Specifically, this work aims to directly test what information is encoded in the instantaneous firing rates and aggregate firing activity of proprioceptors in healthy cat (Specific Aim 1) and in healthy and CIPN rat (Specific Aim 2). Preliminary data suggest that group Ia proprioceptors encode information related to musculotendon kinetics (i.e. passive tension and its first time derivative), but not kinematics (i.e. length and velocity) as previously thought. Usng a combination of previously collected and new datasets with simple musculotendon and spiking neuron model, the proposed work will explicitly test hypotheses about the relationship between firing rates and aggregate activity of group Ia, Ib, and II proprioceptors and musculotendon kinetics in anesthetized cat (healthy) and rat (healthy and neuropathic)."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive renewal application for a 20 year T32 program to train postdoctoral fellows in gastrointestinal basic scientific research by 22 highly selected interdisciplinary faculty mentors drawn from the Center for Gastrointestinal Biology and Disease (CGIBD). The primary goal of this program is to develop the future academic and scientific leaders of gastroenterology by training promising clinically trained (MD, MD/PhD, DVM, DVM/PhD) and PhD postdoctoral fellows to become independent laboratory-based investigators. A diverse, extensive and integrated training program helps our trainees develop new insights into the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal diseases and perform basic and translational research to identify novel diagnostic and treatment approaches. We propose to continue supporting four postdoctoral fellows for 2 years of full time lab-based research. We recruit clinically trained research gastroenterology fellows and PhD postdoctoral fellows, with an equal distribution of clinically trained and PhD trainees. We have a comprehensive, interactive training program that integrates trainees of different backgrounds to broaden the educational experience of all participants. The effectiveness of this integrated training program is proven by results: 16 of our 18 postdoctoral trainees who have completed their T32 mentored training over the past 10 years have obtained academic positions or are currently continuing their training and both of our medical students (supplemental awards) continue their clinical training. We have filled our full complement of trainees for each year of funding with exceptionally well qualified trainees who were actively engaged in basic GI research under highly qualified mentors. Under the stable leadership of Drs. Sartor and Henning, our T32 training program has undergone continued evolution since the last competitive renewal in 2011 that has improved our ability to prepare trainees for independent research careers. We have created a cohesive program with monthly interactions among the T32 trainees and the Executive Committee, a formal research committee for all trainees, written annual progress reviews for each trainee and established an Advisory Committee for external oversight and guidance, including improved recruitment of minority background trainees. Finally, we have appointed extremely talented trainees and maintained an equal balance between clinical and PhD trainees over the past funding cycle. One graduated MD trainee from an underrepresented racial group from the current cycle is now an Assistant Professor at another institution."
"9330983","2017 International HBV Meeting Project Summary/Abstract In this proposal, we request for funding to support the travel expenses for young scientists to attend and participate in the 2017 International Meeting on the Molecular Biology of Hepatitis B Viruses, scheduled for September 3-7, 2017 at the Omni Shoreham Conference Center and Hotel, Washington DC. This meeting is the only forum that gathers the international community of researchers that focus on the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the closely associated hepatitis delta virus (HDV). Approximately 25% of the world's population has been infected by HBV. Unfortunately, despite the availability of prophylactic vaccines, many new infections occur worldwide, mostly because of underutilization of the vaccine due to cost and other issues. Moreover, for the approximately 350 million people already chronically infected with HBV (approximately 15 million of whom are co-infected with HDV), the vaccine is of no therapeutic value. As a result, between 0.5 and 1 million people die of HBV/HDV every year worldwide. It is therefore imperative that basic research on HBV continues, and the latest progress in the field is discussed and disseminated in a timely manner. The annual HBV meeting provides the forum for scientific exchanges and the dissemination of latest research information. The 2017 meeting will uphold and enhance the traditional format. It will consist of 8 oral scientific sessions and 2 poster sessions as well as less structured ?networking? time. The scientific interactions will be facilitated by 3-4 keynote addresses. As in the past, great effort has been made to minimize the cost of the meeting. Furthermore, the Hepatitis B Foundation has made a strong commitment to support this meeting since 2005, in terms of providing a permanent home for organizing the meeting and making its staff available for supervising the meeting and publicizing it, especially to universities with large numbers of underrepresented minorities. In order to allow the participation of junior and minority investigators, support from the NIH to help defray the meeting costs is requested. It is expected that 300-400 attendees will register for the 2017 HBV meeting, which will mark the 33rd anniversary of the HBV meeting."
"9389777","Project Summary/Abstract  Only recently has the extent of the diversity of innate immune effector functions become apparent, with the discovery of multiple novel subtypes of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), beyond long recognized natural killer cells. ILCs derive from common lymphoid progenitors (CLP) in the bone marrow, and a number of transcriptional regulators that are involved in ILC development also play roles in the development of T cells in the thymus. Among these is TOX (thymocyte-selection associated HMG-box protein), a nuclear DNA binding protein and member of the HMG-box superfamily of proteins.  Our previous work has shown that TOX is required for CD4 T cell lineage development in the thymus, and for early ILC lineage specification. Using a TOX reporter strain of mouse we have now identified bone marrow progenitor cells that may be in transition from CLP to the common progenitor to all helper-like innate lymphoid cells (CHILP). CHILP highly express the transcriptional regulator Id2, but we have identified Tox+Id2lo putative precursor cells, suggesting that upregulation of TOX likely precedes the formation of CHILP. We propose to test the cell fate potential of these cells in vitro and in vivo, to determine what ILC lineages they can form and if they have lost T cell potential. Similarly, we will ask if ILC lineage specification even precedes Tox upregulation. Armed with this knowledge, we then propose to determine the transcriptome in these cell types, at the single cell level, and to determine the influence of TOX on gene expression. Notch signaling is also thought to play a role in early ILC lineage specification. We propose that transient Notch signaling is key to distinguish ILC from T cell lineage commitment. Using an in vitro model system that allows differentiation of CLP to multiple ILC subtypes, we will study the cell fate and transcriptional consequences of a temporally limited Notch signal. As Tcf7 (encoding TCF-1), a key Notch signaling target gene, is likely downstream of TOX, we ask if expression of Tcf7 can compensate for loss of TOX. Finally, we address the underlying mechanism of action of TOX, using in vitro and in vivo approaches to ask if TOX functions as part of a novel RSF ISWI chromatin-remodeling complex, and propose to produce a novel mouse strain to aid in identification of gene targets and protein binding partners of TOX in multiple cell contexts."
"9352549","Phosgene (carbonyl chloride, COCl2) is a toxic industrial chemical that causes alveolar injury, resulting in acute pulmonary edema and fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome. No effective therapy currently exists to treat phosgene-induced acute lung injury (ALI), and it is considered a significant chemical threat. Pulmonary edema results from a disruption of alveolar capillary endothelial barrier function. A critical regulator of such barrier function is the endothelial receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2. Tie2 activation by its agonist ligand, angiopoietin-1 (ANG-1), promotes vascular integrity, thereby preventing vascular leak induced by inflammation and other factors. In contrast, ANG-2, which acts primarily as a Tie2 antagonist, promotes vascular leak in a variety of pathological conditions. Importantly, ANG-2 expression is increased in phosgene-induced ALI, suggesting that decreased Tie2 activity is an important factor in phosgene-induced pulmonary edema. In addition to ANG-2, Tie2 is negatively regulated by vascular endothelial-protein tyrosine phosphatase (VE-PTP). Our group has developed highly selective small molecule inhibitors of VE-PTP, which dramatically increase Tie2 activity and promote endothelial barrier function in multiple preclinical models. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that one such VE-PTP inhibitor, AKB-9785, significantly reduces vascular permeability and mortality in a mouse model of phosgene-induced ALI, suggesting that this novel class of compounds could be effective treatments for pulmonary edema secondary to inhalation of phosgene and other alveolar-targeted toxic industrial gases. In work performed under our recent CounterACT R21 award, we have made significant progress in identifying therapeutics for the above clinical syndromes. Specifically, we have: 1) developed a nose-only mouse exposure model of phosgene-induced ALI that allows us to study and treat the respiratory effects of phosgene inhalation; 2) identified potent, selective VE-PTP inhibitors/Tie2 activators through in vitro screening; 3) validated VE-PTP inhibition as an effective therapeutic for reducing pulmonary vascular leak after phosgene inhalation; and 4) demonstrated preliminary efficacy of VE-PTP inhibition in the reduction of phosgene inhalation-induced mortality. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that pharmacological activation of Tie2 using highly selective and potent small molecule inhibitors of VE-PTP will prevent phosgene- induced vascular leak, pulmonary edema, and mortality. Accordingly, the Specific Aims of this proposal are to: 1) Identify the most potent VE-PTP inhibitors with the greatest efficacy in vitro and in vivo; 2) Demonstrate that VE-PTP inhibitors prevent phosgene-induced pulmonary vascular leak and reduce markers of acute lung injury; and 3) Identify the best VE-PTP inhibitor that successfully inhibits phosgene-induced mortality. Accomplishing these Specific Aims is expected to lead to the identification of drugs that can be rapidly translated into effective therapies for the treatment of ALI induced by phosgene and other alveolar- targeted toxic industrial gases."
"9378051","Summary? Rethinking the zinc-copper relationship in Wilson Disease Wilson Disease is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism that impacts an estimated 1:30,000 people. The disease is caused by mutations in the ATP7B copper transporter that leads to pathologic and ultimately lethal copper accumulation in tissues, particularly in the liver and brain. Though the genetic cause of Wilson Disease is known, the underlying mechanisms by which copper overload causes disease is still poorly defined. Copper accumulation is expected to induce oxidative damage to cellular structures; though this mechanism appears to be more apparent later in disease progression, while the early and copper-specific molecular effects of copper accumulation remain elusive. Therapies for Wilson Disease include consumption of a low-copper diet, treatment with de-coppering drugs and zinc supplementation. Zinc supplementation is thought to limit copper absorption by a competition and buffering effect in the intestinal cells, whereby copper is eliminated through natural turnover of the intestinal lining. Our recent work and that of others indicates that zinc-dependent proteins are specifically affected in Wilson Disease, with important physiological impacts on lipid metabolism. Our preliminary data has made novel observations in the genetically-engineered mouse model of Wilson Disease that reveal zinc homeostasis and zinc-dependent processes are disrupted by excess copper. We observed that zinc acquisition machinery is activated in the liver and the liver of the Wilson Disease mouse accumulates excess zinc alongside of copper. This work is undertaken to understand the copper-zinc interaction in Wilson Disease and how clinical therapies impact zinc-dependent systems. The results of the work have potential to inform and improve treatment of Wilson Disease."

Roughly one-third of the U.S. population is obese, and it is estimated that nearly half of the population will be obese within the next two decades. To date, studies investigating the neural contribution to body weight control have focused largely on neuropeptidergic signaling in the hypothalamus, a key brain region involved in feeding behavior. However, signaling from extra-hypothalamic brain regions has also been implicated in regulating nutrient metabolism, appetite, and satiety. We recently uncovered a novel mechanism by which cholinergic signaling in the basal forebrain strongly influences body weight control. This discovery provides intriguing evidence that specific cholinergic signaling pathways in the brain critically regulate feeding behavior and body weight homeostasis. To elucidate the mechanisms by which forebrain cholinergic signaling influences body weight management, feeding behaviors, and metabolism, we will test the hypothesis that cholinergic signaling modulates metabolic and appetitive programs to regulate body weight. Using a combination conditional genetic targeting, optogenetic manipulations, electrophysiology, and behavioral analysis, we will set out to determine the role for basal forebrain cholinergic signaling in body weight control and obesity."
"9531150","ABSTRACT Despite the high prevalence of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in this region. Predictors of CVD are well-established in resource-rich countries, but whether these same risk factors are strongly associated with CVD in sub-Saharan Africa is not known. Growing evidence from the US and Europe suggests that HIV itself may be a risk factor for CVD, through a combination of medication side effects, inflammation and immune activation, but how HIV disease and treatment impacts CVD risk in Kenya and other countries with generalized HIV epidemics is less well studied. The overall goal of this proposal is to determine the prevalence of traditional and non-traditional risk factors for CVD in HIV-infected and uninfected men and women in western Kenya. Metabolic risk factors include hyperlipidemia, glucose intolerance and obesity, which when taken together define a metabolic syndrome (MetS) that has been associated with myocardial infarction and stroke in high-income countries. This will be the focus of the first aim. In the second aim, we determine prevalence and predictors of chronic inflammation and immune activation, comparing risk factor prevalence among HIV-infected and uninfected and defining contributions of high HIV RNA levels, antiretroviral use, and other HIV-specific risk factors among those with HIV. In our third aim, we define rates of subclinical atherosclerosis among these Kenyan adults using high resolution ultrasound to measure carotid intima media thickness (C-IMT). Our multidisciplinary team from the University of Washington (UW), University of Nairobi, Kenyatta National Hospital and the Kenya Ministry of Health will conduct this cross-sectional study of 600 participants, 300 of whom will be HIV-infected, in a part of Kenya where >10% of the adult population is infected with HIV. We will leverage 30 years of experience doing research and training in Kenya, and 10 years implementing studies in the Kisumu District Hospital and surrounding community, to identify young and middle aged individuals with CVD risk factors and abnormal C- IMT. HIV-infected men and women >30 years old will be recruited from HIV clinics and uninfected participants at voluntary HIV testing sites and through outreach to partners. During a single follow-up visit, an interview, blood draw, and carotid ultrasound will be performed; assays will be conducted at a local research laboratory (glucose, lipids) and UW (Interleukin-6, highly sensitive C-reactive protein). This exploratory R21 application is innovative in its use of new technologies to assess C-IMT in HIV-infected and uninfected Kenyans. It will lay a solid foundation for expanding our established research infrastructure into research on CVD and non- communicable diseases by significantly advancing our understanding of subclinical atherosclerosis and how risk is modulated by HIV, metabolic risk factors, inflammation and immune activation. These data will be critical to developing targeted, feasible intervention trials to combat CVD in sub-Saharan Africa over the next decade."
"9314676","Project summary The mentored research project and training plan in this application will help Dr Joji Suzuki become an independent investigator to improve the treatment of patients with opioid use disorders (OUD) initially identified in general medical settings. This is an area of enormous public health concern because patients with OUDs frequently access general medical care, such as hospitals and emergency rooms, and are more likely to be readmitted following discharge. As such, general medical settings may be important venues in which to initiate treatment. However, very little is known about the optimal methods to initiate and retain patients in effective substance use disorder treatment during and after hospitalizations. To fill this unmet need, the proposed project will test the ISTOP intervention (Initiating Substance Use Disorder Treatment for Hospitalized Opioid Use Disorder Patients) targeting hospitalized OUD patients in a randomized clinical trial. The ISTOP intervention combines buprenorphine initiated in the hospital, a care manager in the hospital to address domains shown to reduce readmissions, and a recovery coach to work with participants in the community after discharge. The goal is to increase treatment retention, reduce illicit opioid use, and reduce readmissions. If the ISTOP intervention proves to be effective, it will lay the foundation for a future R01 application. Dr Suzuki will be mentored by a group of renowned researchers to achieve the following training goals: 1) obtain a mentored experience conducting a clinical trial for the treatment of OUD patients, 2) gain proficiency in conducting research that integrates pharmacologic and psychosocial treatments for OUD in the community setting, 3) develop skills in researching treatments for OUD initiated in general medical settings and continued into the community, and 4) develop greater understanding of quantitative methods needed for clinical research. These training goals will be met by a combination of close mentorship, formal coursework, seminars/workshops, and conference attendance. The training and research project will be overseen by a mentoring team composed of his primary mentor Dr Roger Weiss, an internationally recognized addiction researcher with considerable expertise in OUD; co-mentor Dr Jane Liebschutz, a researcher with expertise studying substance use disorders in medical settings; co-mentor Dr David Smelson, a researcher with considerable experience with community-based research including researching recovery coaches; co-mentor Dr Jeffrey Schnipper, a researcher with expertise studying health outcomes for hospitalized patients; and co-mentor Dr Robert Glynn, a researcher with extensive experience in designing and analyzing clinical trials. With access to a NIH-funded Clinical and Translational Science Center (Harvard Catalyst) and the career development support through Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Dr Suzuki is in an ideal academic environment to realize these trainings goals and to successfully complete the proposed project. The proposal is consistent with NIDA's strategic plan to develop successful treatments for OUD and improve treatment accessibility."
"9544670","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to determine how human lung epithelial homeostasis is regulated in acute lung injury induced by the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus. Because of the rapid transmission and high potential for increased pathogenicity of the H1N1 pandemic virus, there is an urgent need to understand the host response against viral infection. This virus targets distal lung cells and causes more severe disease than seasonal influenza virus, including diffuse alveolar damage and pulmonary edema. To define the mechanism of this tissue injury, it is important to study the specific cells that are infected by te virus. Therefore, our studies will focus on the cells in the alveolar region of the human lung. Our approach is novel in that we will study the effect of 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus on primary cultures of human alveolar epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages isolated from the same healthy lung donors. We have preliminary data using this system that suggests the involvement of both the AIM2 inflammasome and the cytokine TSLP in host response to influenza virus infection. The AIM2 inflammasome is important for host defense against bacteria and DNA virus infection, but a role for it in RNA virus infection has not previously been identified. Here we wil determine the function and mechanism of the AIM2 inflammasome in primary human ATII cells and in a mouse model during H1N1 influenza-induced epithelial injury. We hypothesize that AIM2 is the primary inflammasome induced by influenza virus in alveolar epithelial cells. AIM2 deficient cells and AIM2 deficient mice will have more impairment of the epithelial barrier during influenza infection. TSLP plays a key role in allergic diseases such as asthma, but its effect on the epithelial barrier is not yet defined. We will determine the role of TSLP in protecting the alveolar epithelial barrier during influenza infection using both in vitro and in vivo models. We hypothesize that inflammasome activation will enhance the TSLP production by alveolar epithelial cells. Influenza-stimulated TSLP will improve the damaged barrier by influenza both in vitro and in vivo through enhancing the tight junctions between cells and/or stimulating epithelial proliferation. In addition, the cell-cell interaction between alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages will enhance the release of TSLP by epithelial cells. Our study will reveal novel mechanisms for the regulation of the alveolar epithelial barrier during acute lung injury by influenza, thereby uncovering potential novel therapeutic strategies for reducing influenza-induced mortality."
"9384534","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Huntington's disease (HD) is an adult-onset autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized clinically by cognitive, psychiatric and motor deficits which progress to severe disability and death. To date there are no affective treatments for HD. The mutated huntingtin (mHTT) protein is widely expressed in neuronal and non-neuronal cells, yet neurodegeneration critically affects a few subsets of neuronal cell types in the brain. Understanding the toxicity produced by mhtt in non-neuronal cell types and the basis for this selective neurodegeneration are likely to be critical in the desin of effective therapies for the disease.  The goal of this proposal is to expand our knowledge of the contribution of full length-mHTT (fl-mHTT) expressing astrocytes to neurodegeneration in HD. Astrocytes are critical to the proper function and development of the nervous system. They are involved in modulating synaptic activity and neurotransmission. Studies from our laboratory have uncovered increased SNARE-dependent glutamate release from astrocytes in culture taken from the conditional fl-mHTT expressing BACHD mouse model. This is a new found disruption caused by fl-mHTT expression in the astrocytes, which further implicates these cells in HD pathogenesis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that reducing fl-mHTT expression in astrocytes in vivo, contributes to the behavioral and neuropathological phenotypes observed in the conditional BACHD mouse model. The studies proposed here will further our understanding of astrocyte contribution to HD and determine if targeting this cell type for therapeutic intervention is worthwhile. We will use conditional genetic mouse models in these studies and propose three aims: 1) To determine if fl-mHTT expressing astrocytes contribute to HD pathogenesis by increasing glutamate levels in BACHD mice through exocytosis of glutamate; 2) To determine if expression of mutant huntingtin in astrocytes contributes to the abnormal medium spiny neuron physiology observed in BACHD mice; and 3) To determine if decreasing fl-mHTT expression in astrocytes after disease onset in BACHD mice is sufficient to alleviate HD symptoms and whether astrocyte specific expression in a new mouse model is sufficient to cause HD-like phenotypes in mice. Together these studies will help to define the role of fl-mHTT within astrocytes in HD pathogenesis, and may lead to novel therapeutic approaches for treatment of HD."
"9369218","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dr. McCoy is an endocrinologist and primary care physician specializing in the care for patients with diabetes and other chronic health conditions. Her long-term goal is to become an independent researcher and leader in evaluating, improving, and individualizing diabetes care through effective use of big data completed by qualitative insights from patients and those involved in their care. The short-term training goals of this proposal are to acquire: 1) proficiency in statistics and data science; 2) experience in qualitative research; 3) skills in clinical trial design; and 4) communication and leadership skills to lead multi-disciplinary research. The proposal's research will be conducted at Mayo Clinic, which has a strong history of training physician scientists and a well-developed infrastructure for education and research. Dr. McCoy has access to an ideal set of data assets, the OptumLabs Data Warehouse and the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry, and the support of an exceptional team of mentors and advisors who are national leaders in diabetes outcomes and health care delivery research, shared decision-making, qualitative research, and data science. Optimization of glycemic control, while avoiding severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, is the cornerstone of diabetes management. Severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia are often preventable, yet continue to incur substantial morbidity, psychological distress, impaired quality of life, and economic burden. There are no validated tools to predict these events and as a result clinicians lack a practical and reliable means to identify high risk patients. The goal of Dr. McCoy's work is to address this critical gap in diabetes management. In Aim 1, she will use large database analysis and novel analytic methods to characterize the patterns of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia among adults with diabetes in the U.S. In Aim 2, she will build on Aim 1 to develop and validate computationally efficient concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia that could be used in clinical encounters. In Aim 3, she will directly engage patients and their clinicians in conversation about severe hypoglycemia /hyperglycemia risk in order to better understand how information about severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk is perceived, interpreted, and used. These studies will serve as foundation for two R01 applications to be submitted during Years 4 and 5, and will advance the science and practice of personalized diabetes care through integration of data science and qualitative methods for the purpose of understanding, predicting, and ultimately preventing severe hypoglycemic/hyperglycemic events. Dr. McCoy has a proven track record of scientific productivity and innovation, and a strong foundation in using secondary data for health services and outcomes research in diabetes. In summary, the training, mentoring, and research proposed here are essential for Dr. McCoy's career development as she develops research independence and expertise in the crucial interface between patients and their clinical teams, evidence-based medicine, and big data."
"9380595","PROJECT SUMMARY  Opioids such as morphine, codeine, and oxycodone are the most potent analgesics widely used in clinical practice. Unfortunately, their utility is severely limited by serious side effects that include development of addiction and tolerance following prolonged use. Opioids exert their clinically significant effects through the activation of the mu-opioid receptor (MOR). We have identified that the critical role in controlling the extent of MOR signaling and dissociating beneficial (analgesia) from detrimental (tolerance and dependence) effects of opioids belongs to a complex of proteins composed of Regulator of G protein Signaling type 7 (RGS7) and its subunit: RGS7 Binding Protein (R7BP). Based on these observations we hypothesize that targeting RGS- R7BP complex pharmacologically may offer a strategy to mitigate undesirable effects of opioids.  We have developed an innovative biochemical assay to track rearrangement within the RGS7-R7BP complex by Time Resolved Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (TR-FRET). The assay was adapted for the high-throughput screening (HTS) setting and validated in pilot experiments by screening libraries of small compounds. We further developed a suite of orthogonal and secondary approaches to evaluate the effects of pharmacological inhibition of RGS7-R7BP complex mimicking its physiological action in the endogenous setting. The specific focus of this proposal is on the implementation of the full HTS screen of the ~640,000 compound library to identify first-in-class inhibitors of RGS7-R7BP complex function followed by comprehensive validation of identified leads. Our approach is based on combining thorough understanding of the RGS biology and wealth of accumulated experimental tools obtained by studying their mechanisms over the last decade with the proven expertise of the drug discovery team at The Scripps Research Institute. Our team includes experts in assaying cell signaling, experts in HTS and lead identification as well as medicinal chemistry and pharmacokinetic resources. It is anticipated that successful accomplishment of these goals will provide a critical step towards making opioid medications safer. Outside of the translational aspects, chemical probes targeting RGS complexes is expected to prove useful for uncovering fundamental mechanisms that regulate neurotransmitter actions as small molecule ligands for these proteins are not currently available."
"9358012","Project Summary Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic progressive neurologic disease that is the most common degenerative cause of impaired movement. It is estimated to affect 1 million Americans and its prevalence is predicted to double in developed nations by 2030 as the average age of these populations increases. PD has been the prototypic neurodegenerative disorder for which effective medical and surgical therapies exist to alleviate symptoms. However these treatments neither protect nor restore neural systems and there is a progressive deterioration in the quality of life. There is therefore a compelling need to develop therapies for this disease that prevent ongoing degeneration. The development of such therapies depends on a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease process such that critical mediators can be targeted. Since the discovery that mutations in the gene for ?-synuclein can cause PD, it has become a principal molecule of interest in the pathogenesis. There is now a growing consensus that, at a cellular level, ?-synuclein pathology first appears in axons. Furthermore, in PD it is clear that substantial damage has occurred to the axon projections by the time of diagnosis. The fact that ?-synuclein pathology first appears in axons does not necessarily mean that that they are the site of the earliest disease-related events at the molecular level. There is a substantial body of evidence that the earliest molecular events may occur within the nucleus. Where ?- synuclein first acts at a molecular level to initiate the pathological events underlying PD has not previously been addressed in a living mammalian system. The purpose of this proposal therefore is to address this fundamentally important question in vivo in mice using an AAV 2/7 h-?-synuclein(WT) model to deliver differentially targeted forms of ?-synuclein. We hypothesize that ?-synuclein acts first within the nucleus to initiate the pathologic events that underlie the onset of PD. We will test this hypothesis in two Specific Aims in which we will examine the differential effects of targeted forms of synuclein on the number and morphology of axons in the medial forebrain bundle. Our proposal is unique not only for being the first to examine the initial site of action of ?-synuclein in vivo, but also for using novel methodologies, developed in our lab, for monitoring axonal populations as the most sensitive indicators of early disease-related events. Our results will provide a much-needed fundamental advance in our understanding of how synuclein causes this disease."
"9410400","PROJECT SUMMARY Rapid saliva test for diagnostics of Neuro-Cognitive Disorder due to TBI The goal of this Phase II SBIR project is to develop a rapid saliva test for diagnostics of Neuro-Cognitive Disorder due to Traumatic Brain Injury (NCDT). About 30% TBI patients develop NCDT, a serious chronic disease. Standard NCDT diagnosis is based a battery of neuropsychological tests administered in hospital. Weaknesses of the standard practice: not objective, low accuracy, high cost and inconvenience. The proposed project will develop rapid commercial test for NCDT diagnostics in point-of-care (POC). The commercial test will be a disposable lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) based on innovative technologies: 1/ Saliva-based NCDT biomarkers and 2 / Multiplexed LFIA for whole saliva. Key advantages over standard practice: objective, accurate, simple and inexpensive NCDT test. Phase I R&D identified N=15 candidate NCDT biomarkers with diagnostic accuracy ?80% for NCDT, independent predictors, baseline concentration >10 ng/ml and fold increase in NCDT ?5-fold. Specific objectives for Phase II: SA1 will collect N=2,610 longitudinal saliva samples from N=500 patients in a multi-center study: N=120 NCDT and N=380 controls. SA2 will measure 15 candidate NCDT biomarkers in saliva samples from SA1 using 3 gold standard saliva assays validated in Phase I. Results will cross-validate the diagnostic accuracy of the biomarkers, and down select 3 best biomarkers for the commercial NCDT test. SA3 will develop a prototype commercial LFIA test for measuring 3 NCDT biomarkers in whole saliva. The proposed NCDT test has potential to radically change standard practice in TBI care by providing valid, objective NCDT diagnostics, a key element for decisions about return to play, starting intervention, and for advancing TBI treatment. The proposed project has strong commercial potential based on existing team of proven industry partners and tested FDA regulatory path for the commercial device."
"9394954","Project Summary/Abstract  Reversible protein lysine acetylation is a fundamental posttranslational modification observed in histone and non-histone proteins. Lysine acetylation can alter protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, protein stability, and enzyme activation/deactivation. Among the major regulators of lysine acetylation is the histone deacetylase (HDAC) family. Of the 18 known human HDACs, 11 are metal-dependent hydrolases related to the acetylpolyamine amidohydrolases (APAHs). The HDACs contribute to the regulation of gene expression and many other critical cellular processes. Notably, abnormal lysine acetylation is observed in multiple human disorders, including cancer; thus HDACs are a validated drug target. Despite their critical biological functions and clinical roles as drug targets, little is known about the molecular basis for HDAC substrate specificity and inhibition. This is particularly the case for HDACs 10 and 11, which are the least well characterized of the metal-dependent HDACs.  Our preliminary studies coupled with phylogenetic comparisons suggest that HDACs 10 and 11 may function as dual acetyllysine and acetylpolyamine deacetylases with unique substrate binding site architectures. However, how HDAC10 and 11 could accommodate small polyamine substrates as well as large protein substrates containing sissile acetyllysine moieties is unclear. In addition, while classic HDAC inhibitors such as SAHA are known to inhibit HDACs 10 and 11, the molecular basis for this inhibition is unknown as no HDAC10-inhibitor or HDAC11-inibitor complex structures are available. In fact, no structure of HDAC11 is available, despite the fact that HDAC11 represents a unique class of HDAC due to its limited sequence identity with other HDACs. We propose to study structure-function relationships for HDACs 10 and 11 to establish a molecular foundation for understanding substrate recognition, catalysis, and inhibition. Due to a lack of structural and mechanistic studies focusing on HDACs 10 and 11, we are currently unequipped to design HDAC isozyme-specific inhibitors.  I propose to study the molecular mechanisms of HDAC substrate recognition and inhibition by (1) exploring the structural basis of HDAC10 substrate specificity; (2) defining the structural basis of HDAC10 inhibition; and (3) determining structure-function relationships for HDAC11. As mentioned above, aberrant lysine acetylation is a hallmark of certain cancers and other human disorders; therefore HDACs are critical drug targets. Currently, four broad-specificity HDAC inhibitors are FDA-approved for cancer chemotherapy, but isozyme-specific HDAC inhibitors are mostly unavailable. Our studies aim to better understand the structure and function of poorly characterized HDACs with the goal of facilitating the design of specific HDAC inhibitors for use in human disorders, particularly cancer."
"9360014","Through our previous work funded by the American Parkinson Disease Association and NINDS, we have discovered a new genetic locus on the short arm of chromosome 20, and identified a new PD gene, TMEM230. TMEM230-linked PD shows clinical and pathological features compatible with those in sporadic PD. TMEM230, also known as C20orf30, is an uncharacterized gene. We performed extensive genetic and cellular studies on this new PD gene in vitro. We found that TMEM230 encodes a transmembrane protein of secretory and recycling vesicles, including synaptic vesicles in neurons. We also found that TMEM230 is a component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. We further performed functional studies and found that PD-linked TMEM230 mutants identified in our study impair synaptic vesicle trafficking and alpha-synuclein clearance in vitro. TMEM230 is the first transmembrane protein of synaptic vesicles identified in PD to date. Our findings, therefore, directly point to the dysfunction of synaptic vesicles in the pathogenesis of PD. The precise functions of TMEM230, and pathogenic mechanism of the TMEM230-mediated PD remain unclear. Based on the molecular features of TMEM230, and its relationship with synaptic vesicle and endosomal markers tested in our study, we hypothesize that TMEM230 is a trafficking protein of secretory/recycling vesicles, primarily involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis, endocytosis and recycling, and synaptic transmission in neurons; and dysfunction of the synaptic vesicles, such as impaired trafficking, recycling and synaptic transmission, underlies the pathogenesis of the TMEM230-linked PD, and possibly other forms of PD as well. Although our preliminary data in vitro are consistent with this hypothesis, in vivo data are lacking. Appropriate animal models relevant to testing potential pathogenic mechanisms have not been developed. In this application, we propose three closely interactive specific aims to generate relevant mouse models and test this hypothesis in vivo. In Specific Aim1, we will develop all three representative types of mouse models, including knockout, knockin and transgenic models. These models will provide unique and essential resources for mechanistic studies in Specific Aims 2 and 3. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the effects of different types of TMEM230 genetic modifications on alpha-synuclein clearance, motor and non-motor phenotypes, and PD-related pathology in the mouse models. To further provide insights into the molecular underpinning of PD phenotype and pathology caused by TMEM230-related mutations, we will use a combination of electrophysiological and cell biological approaches to study synaptic vesicle trafficking and synaptic transmission in the mouse models in Specific Aim 3. Successful completion of the proposed studies of this new PD-linked gene in mouse models should provide essential information for understanding the physiological functions of TMEM230, and the role of the mutant TMEM230 in the pathogenesis underlying PD. The positive outcomes from this application may also provide a mechanistic basis for PD therapeutic development."

Some of the specific aims build on chemistry that was developed in the previous funding cycle, while other specific aims are entirely new. Specifically, we propose to (1) the design of low- coordination number catalysts for directed sp2 and sp3 C?H borylation; (2) The design of ligand frameworks for meta and para C?H borylations; and (3) Hydrogenation of C?H borylated arenes and heterocycles to achieve formal sp3 C?H borylation. We will pursue these aims through a collaborative multi-investigator venture that bring the power of inorganic chemistry and organic synthesis to bear on the problem."
"9292881","PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) is a well-described and empirically validated treatment for depression. Though its efficacy is unassailable, it is often delivered with low fidelity in the community. We are in need of well-validated measures of fidelity to ensure that it is being delivered in the community at high quality so that patients benefit maximally.  This proposal is submitted in response to NIMH RFA-MH-17-500, ?Pragmatic Strategies for Assessing Psychotherapy Quality in Practice.? The RFA specifically requests that proposals develop and test pragmatic strategies for evaluating psychotherapy fidelity that are both psychometrically rigorous and feasible for use in the community, and strongly emphasizes the need for large sample sizes so that the instruments and strategies are extremely well validated. Moreover, the RFA emphasizes the inclusion of all stakeholders in the process of instrument and strategy development.  In response, we propose to conduct a two-phase study. Phase I will be a three year project to develop and validate 3 fidelity instruments (to be used by therapists, patients, and supervisors) as well as tools to abstract fidelity data from the medical record to measure the adherence and quality of the delivery of IPT. Specific steps include a review of qualitative feedback by IPT and other psychotherapy experts, community therapists, supervisors, administrators, and patients, with subsequent development of prototype measures of IPT effectiveness fidelity and tools to collect the data generated. These measures will then be pilot tested with 250 clinician-patient dyads in the community, comparing them to expert ratings of IPT and to standard outcome measures. The study will take place in the public mental health system in Los Angeles County, allowing us to work with an extremely diverse set of therapists and patients. We have done extensive work in LA, including training over 1300 therapists in IPT, developing an infrastructure to implement the treatment, and have established extensive liaison relationships with the LA County Department of Mental Health and 35 individual agencies within LA County.  Phase II will be a prospective validation of our final instruments, which we will finalize using the data from our pilot trial and additional stakeholder and expert input. We will test the final instruments by comparing them to expert ratings of IPT and to standard outcome measures with another unique set of 250 therapist-patient dyads in the community. At the conclusion, we will collect data from all stakeholders to confirm feasibility and to estimate the cost of implementation and burden on the system.  In sum, we will develop and test a well-validated system to measure of the fidelity of IPT treatment delivery and implementation in the community, including well-validated measures for use by therapists, supervisors, and patients."
"9353789","PROGRAM SUMMARY/ABSTRACT While there has been much progress in building an evidence base to prevent diabetes and its complications, and some important improvements in quality of care and incidence of vascular complications among people with diagnosed diabetes over the past 25 years, there is a large unfinished agenda. Identification of people at risk and with diabetes, and uptake of prevention programs are all suboptimal; much more can be done to achieve recommended care goals and reduce morbidity, especially among the vulnerable and minorities. Translation research and data, especially in the areas of health services research, design, and evaluation can help close the gaps by tailoring diabetes prevention and control efforts to better suit target populations, and by generating policy- and practice-oriented data to inform investments in diabetes interventions. Though there appears to be plentiful demand in the Southeastern US, availability of relevant expertise in health services research, design, and evaluation is limited and/or fragmented in the region. The Georgia Diabetes Translation Research Center's Core B (Design and Evaluation) is poised to fill this void by offering an accessible, cohesive, and multi-disciplinary team of reputed experts in diabetes translation research. Core B's collective expertise, networks and partnerships, and access to key national and regional datasets (e.g., the Veterans Affairs and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid data), make it well-suited for stimulating high-quality diabetes translation research and uptake among a wide array of stakeholders (academics, health care, companies, non- profits, and local governments). Core B Faculty bring extensive expertise and experiences, and will engage in three main areas: 1) facilitating health services research, especially through the use of large datasets to generate more state- and local-level data for analytics-driven informed decision-making; 2) assisting investigators in designing patient-centered preventive and care services, facilitating practice change, and developing information management systems; and 3) assisting intervention, program, and policy evaluations using multi-disciplinary approaches (quantitative, qualitative, and economic) and perspectives (patient, provider, payers, and systems). Core B Faculty have training in clinical medicine (primary care, geriatrics, endocrinology, preventive cardiology), nursing, systems design, engineering, statistics, demography, epidemiology, nutrition, business and management, and economics. The Core will embed a culture of multi- disciplinarity, collegiality, continuous learning, and leverage. The Core's reputable Faculty will engage in the Center's catalyst and dissemination activities (Enrichment and P and F Programs, and Regional Core) and will be an accessible, active group with simple operating and reporting structures that help facilitate more effective and cost-effective science. Leveraging this Core's collective expertise and resources offers an expedient and efficient opportunity to advance the field, improving tailoring of services for the increasingly diverse US population, and informing local guidelines to improve metabolic health in the region."
"9410348","Click Diagnostics has developed a new low-cost, disposable, PCR-based diagnostic test for multiplexed detection of the sexually transmitted infections (STI) chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that nearly 20 million new STIs occur every year and account for almost $16 billion in health care costs. Current STI diagnostic testing is primarily done in centralized labs with an average sample-to-result-to-patient timeline of 3 to 5 days. During this time, as many as 30% of STI-positive patients are lost to care and continue to spread the STI. Many others are given inappropriate drugs to avoid the patient leaving without treatment, despite not having test results. Although point-of-care (POC) nucleic acid amplification based instruments are available, they can perform only one test at a time, limiting their usefulness in a busy clinic. To ensure patients receive the appropriate antibiotic, a highly sensitive and specific, affordable, POC diagnostic that provides rapid results is urgently needed. The Click patient-side, single-use disposable, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnostic test, with near 100% accuracy, would allow physicians to ensure no patient with an STI leaves the clinic untreated. Click has developed prototype units, and successfully validated them using clinical vaginal swab samples from patients. In this project, we will refine the device to enable mass production, and optimize the device in preparation for clinical trials, 510(k) regulatory clearance, and a CLIA waiver. This will require product refinements for manufacturability, performing preanalytical and preclinical validation, and usability studies. The goal of Aim 1 is to optimize the pre-production unit for manufacturability and clinical testing. This will require using low cost fabrication techniques, minimizing the part count to reduce unit complexity, and reducing device size and weight. These modifications enable manufacturing readiness to produce units for preanalytical and preclinical testing in Aim 2. Preliminary analytical studies will evaluate the device limit of detection and demonstrate the device results are reproducible and specific. Click has partnered with Planned Parenthood, University of Alabama, and Johns Hopkins University for preclinical testing to validate the Click diagnostic test. Click will also verify test results against a gold standard PCR instrument by Roche. These tests will assess readiness for clinical testing as required for 510(k) regulatory submission. All tests will be done under strict quality control and document control with Click?s advanced quality management system. Lastly, in Aim 3 we will conduct a usability study to ensure that untrained operators can successfully operate the device, as would be required for a CLIA waiver. A CLIA waiver is critical for Click to market its product to physician offices, and pharmacies. Based on user feedback, Click will make any necessary modifications to the device or written instructions to meet CLIA waiver requirements. Successful completion of this work will yield a production version of a rapid, patient-side nucleic acid-based diagnostic device ready for clinical testing."

The vast majority of trainers are primary and joint appointees in the Department of Genetics at the School of Medicine, and virtually all of the trainees over the last funding period have been matriculated in the Molecular Cell Biology, Genetics & Development Track (MCGD) in Biological and Biomedical Sciences at Yale. The focus of the training proposed is the use of genetic and genomic approaches to understand human disease. The main methods used are newly developed next generation sequencing methods for human trait locus discovery, complemented by bioinformatics and computational analysis. An emphasis of the program is integration with model system genetics and genomics, which can be used to define pathways that link gene mutations to disease phenotypes. To this end, investigators performing genetic and genomic analysis of flies, worms, zebrafish, mouse and induced pluripotent stem cells play a major role in this Training Grant. This integrated training environment is intended to provide trainees with broad exposure to genetics and genomics and a rich training environment that prepares them for careers in science. Admitted students have strong scientific backgrounds and research experience with high academic achievement. First year students are supported by Yale; students are supported by the training grant in years 2 and 3, and thereafter by funds in Training Faculty laboratories until graduation. Training in the first year includes formal course work and research rotations, leading to selection of the thesis advisor and laboratory. In the second year, students complete course work, and take a qualifying exam in which they must demonstrate mastery of genetics and defend two written research proposals. Subsequent years are devoted to dissertation research, development of experimental and analytic skills, along with ability in written and oral presentation, leading to preparation of the written thesis. In addition, students engage in supervised teaching experiences. Support is requested for 5 years for support of 7 Ph.D. students per year who are in years 2 and 3 of their training. Outcomes of trainees are documented and indicate high success in completion of the Ph.D., publication of work in high impact journals, and continuation in science of the vast majority of graduating students."
"9355661","The Clinical Translational Core (CTC) promotes the use of, provides access to, and supports state-of- the art technologies and resources to facilitate translation of research findings into the clinical settings of diagnosis and patient care. Our newly configured Core has expanded to incorporate new technologies and resources in the areas of population health, biomedical research, and biomanufacturing, and serves as a focal point for cost-effective and innovative translational research. The CTC has grown in significant ways to support the increase in interest among our investigators in topics ranging from epidemiology and population health through novel therapeutics and clinical trials. Our collection of registries was dramatically enhanced by the formalized relationship with the Personalized Medicine Research Project (PMRP) of the Marshfield Clinic. We now also provide substantial resources for therapeutics development through Waisman Biomanufacturing, which supports translational investigators by assisting in preparing drug development plans, developing cGMP compliant manufacturing and Quality Control test methods, and providing cGMP manufacturing and testing services for pre-clinical animal studies and early-stage human clinical trials. We propose three specific aims for the next project period. Aim 1 is to facilitate recruitment of human participants and access to data/specimens for behavioral, biobehavioral, and biomedical research and clinical trials. Registry coordinators, both in Madison and in Marshfield, will facilitate identification and access to unique individuals or populations relevant to studies on IDD. The Madison cohorts include the individuals and families seen in our clinics and the children in our pre-school (one-third of whom have a disability), as well as several distinct registries such as the IDD registry, the fragile X syndrome registry, the infant-toddler registry, and the K-12 registry (the last two especially useful for recruitment of controls). The Marshfield PMRP cohort includes 20,000 people who have consented to share their electronic health records, DNA, and other biosamples for research, and to be re-contacted for future data collections. Aim 2 is to provide specialized clinical assessments of participants. Core staff will include a clinically certified psychologist and speech-language therapist, who provide standardized psychological and other assessments to supplement the more specialized types of testing needed by the individual projects. Aim 3 is to provide technologies and consultative services to support development of new behavioral methods and custom applications. The Core provides eye-tracking equipment and behavioral testing suites equipped for remote observation, and the staff have particular expertise in database construction and software development. Aim 4 is to promote advancement of therapeutics for IDD populations. The Core provides advanced biomanufacturing capability for viruses, plasmids, proteins, and cellular therapeutics, through the Waisman Biomanufacturing facility. Through the interactions with the clinics and access to the registries the Core also fosters participation in several types of therapeutic research."
"9383407","PROJECT SUMMARY Congenital heart disease (CHD) is genetically complex, with most cases likely reflecting combined effects of variation at multiple genes. Current methods, both statistical and experimental, for discovering causal alleles of genes that produce disease phenotypes only in combination, are very limited. These limitations are a major reason why the genetic origins of most CHD remain unknown, and there is a pressing need to overcome them. To address this need, we propose a novel approach, which exploits genetic syndromes known as ?transcriptomopathies,? in which transcription is globally, yet subtly, disrupted. In one of these, Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS), small changes (mostly <1.5-fold) occur in transcript levels for up to 1,000 genes in each cell. This results in a reproducible spectrum of birth defects that includes CHD. CdLS is most commonly caused by haploinsufficiency for NIPBL, a gene that encodes a cohesin-regulatory protein, and mouse and zebrafish models of Nipbl-haploinsufficiency replicate CdLS phenotypes. Such animal models provide a means to identify how sets of perturbations to gene expression which do not individually cause disease, can act collectively to produce heart defects?thus modeling the multi-genic causation of CHD. Our investigation of such models suggests that causal events likely occur early in embryogenesis during the initial morphogenesis of the heart. Recently, using mouse models in which Nipbl-haploinsufficiency can be switched on and off in different embryonic cell lineages, we discovered that risk for atrial septal defects (ASDs), the main form of CHD in Nipbl+/- mice, is controlled by non-additive interactions between gene expression changes in cardiomyocytes and their progenitors; cells derived from endoderm, endocardium or endothelium; and cells of the rest of the embryo. We now propose to exploit the genetic manipulability of this system to identify both the morphogenetic abnormalities and the individual gene expression changes that collectively produce ASDs. By analyzing early morphogenesis in globally- and conditionally-mutant embryos we will test several hypotheses concerning the role of progenitor cell proliferation, patterning and migration, with a particular focus on the progenitors of the second heart field, which preliminary results suggest may be central to ASD causation. By using a variety of Cre recombinase-expressing mice to conditionally create, and rescue, Nipbl- haploinsufficiency in a variety of lineages, we will investigate the roles of distinct subpopulations of cells in both increasing and decreasing ASD risk. Finally, we will use single-cell RNA sequencing of early embryos to identify gene expression changes associated with Nipbl-haploinsufficiency in those cells responsible for causing ASDs. The result of these studies will be to develop novel, directly testable hypotheses about mechanisms that underlie multifactorial, and multi-genic, CHD."
"9354613","An unprecedented expansion of knowledge in modern immunology has occurred in the relatively young field of innate immunity. The ?Signaling Pathways in Innate Immunity? (SPII) training grant (TG) program for pre- and post-doctoral fellows is only in its 5th year of support and is thriving. The University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM) has significant research and training strengths in this area. The Training Grant Faculty (TGF) for this unique, highly focused program are highly interactive and primarily drawn from the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, with affiliations in interdisciplinary centers and institutes including the Center for Vaccine Development, Institute for Genome Sciences, Center for Vascular and Inflammatory Diseases, Greenebaum Cancer Center, and the Institute of Human Virology. The 28 TGF have a longstanding history of collaboration on grants and publications, and are well funded PIs of grants totaling ~$13.1 million in annual direct costs. Predoctoral trainees will be selected primarily from the interdepartmental Graduate Program in Life Sciences (GPILS) Programs in Molecular Microbiology & Immunology (MMI), a well-established Ph.D. Program that includes a rigorous core curriculum, program-specific courses, elective courses, journal clubs, seminars, annual symposia, and graduate research presentation days. Additional academic work will be combined with demanding laboratory training through dissertation research under the direction of the TGF whose documented expertise will provide inter- and multidisciplinary training opportunities. Predoctoral students are selected from an increasingly qualified applicant pool, as well as from the UMSOM M.D./Ph.D. Program. Similarly, our TG-eligible postdoctoral trainees are increasingly gravitating to laboratories with expertise in innate immune signaling where they receive dedicated mentoring, using state-of-the art resources. Both pre- and postdoctoral trainees have additional didactic and non-didactic requirements, including training in the responsible conduct of research, professional development, and a highly structured mentoring program. Recruitment of trainees from underrepresented minorities is given significant priority through programs aimed at facilitating success in our program, and is reflected in the diversity of our trainees: 13 of 20 training slots (65%) went to women and 25% to underrepresented/disabled individuals. Our TG Program is guided by a highly qualified Advisory Board including the Training Program Director, two Co-Directors, and individuals with significant TG experience. Personal responsibility, including an insistence on scientific rigor and reproducibility, and participation in scientific outreach programs, are strongly encouraged by our TGF using innovative new training components. Our trainees are already building excellent records of publications and awards, and several have already accepted research positions or have left for additional training, providing an early indication that our trainees will continue to be exceptionally well prepared for future careers in academia, government, and industry that will, ultimately, contribute to the nation?s health in significant ways."
"9355660","Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), encoded by the FMR1 gene on the X chromosome, is an RNA-binding protein that regulates the expression of hundreds of genes and plays a key role in brain development and function. The 5' untranslated region of the human FMR1 gene contains various numbers of CGG trinucleotide repeats. The modal number of repeats in the population is 30, whereas expansion of these CGG repeats above 200 leads to fragile X syndrome (FXS). CGG repeats between 55 and 200 are classified as ?premutation?, since these individuals are at increased risk for expansion into the FXS range. There is considerable polymorphism in the number of CGG repeats below 55, and controversy over the true definition of ?normal?. Indeed, the significance of either ?Gray Zone? (variously defined as 45-54 or 41-54) or ?Low Zone? (?23) CGG repeats, although much more prevalent than FXS and the premutation in the general population, are largely unexplored apart from the clinical literature. We have preliminary evidence to suggest that older adults with Low Zone repeats may be at increased risk of difficulties in cognitive and motor functioning as well as for having a child with a disability. We also found, in unpublished preliminary analyses, that Gray Zone expansions are associated with increased psychiatric and other health problems. Here we propose to validate and further explore these intriguing findings in a population-based cohort, a unique opportunity afforded by the Personalized Medicine Research Program (PMRP) of the Marshfield Clinic. In addition, we have established human embryonic stem cell (ESC) lines with defined numbers of CGG repeats. These lines, together with induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) derived from PMRP individuals with Low and Gray Zone CGGs, as well as controls, will provide an opportunity to assess whether having CGG repeats at either end of the distribution that currently is considered normal impairs expression, localization, and functions of FMRP.  Building on our novel observations and unique collaborative opportunities, our two specific aims are to test the hypotheses that Low or Gray Zone CGG repeats in FMR1 are associated at the organismal level with compromised health and an increased risk of having a child with a disability; and at the cellular level with alterations in FMRP function. In Aim 1 we will determine, in a population-based sample, whether individuals with Low or Gray Zone CGG repeats are at increased risk of neurocognitive, motor, and physical and mental health problems, and having a child with a disability. We will use a combination of questionnaires and in-person assessments, as well as supervised machine learning algorithms on the comprehensive database of electronic health records available through the PMRP. In Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that Low Zone or Gray Zone CGGs affect FMRP function and neural differentiation/maturation. We will use a combination of human ES cell lines engineered to have various CGG repeat lengths, and a series of induced pluripotent stem cell lines derived from patients with defined genotypes."
"9394724","Project Summary Bone is a dynamic tissue which requires intricate regulatory processes that must work in synchrony to maintain a healthy skeleton. Alterations in this regulation can lead to bone disease. Diabetes is characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from a lack of insulin or reduced insulin sensitivity and affects over 20 million people in the United States. Individuals with diabetes experience decreased bone quality and an increased susceptibility to fracture, leading to significant disability and morbidity. Diabetic bone disease primarily results from an anabolic defect in which there is deficient osteoblast activity, in contrast to the mainly catabolic dysregulation seen in osteoporosis. Osteoblasts produce fibrillar collagens during bone formation, which require lysyl oxidase (LOX) enzyme-dependent modification of specific lysine residues and subsequent cross-linking in order to form a functional fibrillar network and confer strength to bone. The number of lysyl oxidase-dependent cross-links in collagen is decreased in diabetes, leading to compromised bone microarchitecture. Incretins are gastric hormones released by intestinal K-cells into the circulation which regulate insulin release from pancreatic beta cells. One of these hormones, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide or GIP is anabolic in bone partially mediated independent of its effects action on the pancreas to stimulate insulin release. Deletion of the receptor for this hormone, which is expressed on osteoblasts, results in a reduction in bone strength and material properties in mice similar to the low bone formation osteopenia seen in diabetes. GIP also augments LOX activity in osteoblasts, resulting in an increase in mature, stable collagen cross-links. In diabetes the cellular response to GIP is abnormally low, while serum GIP levels remain the same or elevated. Hypothesis: Diabetes interferes with GIP-stimulated LOX expression in osteoblasts. This is mediated by GIP receptor desensitization and leads to the osteopenic phenotype seen in mouse and human diabetic bone. Aim 1: Evaluate the bone phenotype of diabetic and non-diabetic LOX +/- and wild type bones and establish diminished LOX levels as a critical determinant of bone quality in diabetes Aim 2: Determine the mechanism of GIP up-regulation of LOX under normal conditions in osteoblasts and assess for molecular defects in GIPR signaling under diabetic conditions to develop approaches for treating diabetic osteopenia."
"9331331","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) prevalence has increased over several decades to its current estimated prevalence of 1.5% among 8-year-old children in the United States. Recent research suggests that adverse child neurodevelopmental outcomes, including ASD, may occur in association with maternal obesity and diabetes during pregnancy. Both obesity and diabetes mellitus among women of reproductive age have been increasing and could contribute to the increase in ASD prevalence. Moreover, ambient air pollution (AP), a ubiquitous urban environmental exposure, has been associated with diabetes, including a small number of studies of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and with ASD. Furthermore, there is growing evidence of other neurotoxic effects of AP and potential overlapping biological mechanisms for effects of AP and diabetes. However, there are few prospective population-based studies with high quality outcome and exposure data that have addressed the relationship between AP, GDM, and ASD, and results have not been consistent. The proposed study?s main objective is to assess the relationship of AP to GDM and ASD, including effects of joint exposure to AP and GDM on ASD, using data from a large Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) pregnancy cohort study that showed that maternal GDM was associated with ASD. The aims are: 1) to evaluate the association between prenatal exposure to AP and ASD risk; 2) to examine whether prenatal exposure to AP is also associated with GDM; and 3) to assess whether GDM modifies or mediates the association between prenatal exposure to AP and ASD risk. These aims will be addressed using electronic medical records data from the existing cohort of children born in KPSC hospitals between 1995 and 2013. Gestational and early life exposure to traffic density and residential proximity to major roadways (markers for the near-roadway air pollution mixture), and to regional particulate and gaseous air pollutants will be estimated for approximately 80,000 mother-offspring pairs using a low-cost procedure developed by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)-supported Southern California Environmental Health Sciences Center. Both Cox regression and logistic regression models will be used to examine the associations of AP, GDM, and ASD. The proposed training plan will result in depth of knowledge of neuroepidemiology, specifically ASD, AP exposure assessment, and of statistical analyses necessary for a career as an independent investigator conducting interdisciplinary epidemiologic research on environmental factors contributing to pediatric neurological disorders. The study addresses the NIEHS goal to understand the effects of environmental factors during vulnerable periods that increase the risk of ASD. Furthermore, this study has the potential to address gaps in our understanding of the effects of role of AP in GDM and ASD. AP and GDM are common risk factors amenable to intervention targeting public policy and behavior."
"9304364","The main goal of the current proposal is to identify the molecular and neurobehavioral abnormalities in young adulthood resulting from the genetic mutations of the microtubule-related genes associated with schizophrenia (SZ), such as PCM1, DPYSL2, and 16p11 copy number variations (CNVs), and how these alterations can be exacerbated by adolescent social isolation to produce a full-blown psychiatric disorder in young adulthood. We hypothesize that mice with the microtubule-associated genetic mutations will display stress-related molecular alterations and abnormal prefrontal cortex (PFC) maturation during adolescence and/or young adulthood, leading to adult behavioral phenotypes resembling different dimensions of SZ. Aim 1 will identify the genetic mutations-produced neurobehavioral abnormalities that can be exacerbated by adolescent social isolation in mice. We will identify the effects of the genetic risk factors on SZ-related behaviors as well as maturation of GABAergic interneurons and dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons in the PFC. We will also examine if these phenotypes are exacerbated by adolescent social isolation. Aim 2 will determine the genetic mutations- produced molecular changes that can be intensified by adolescent social isolation. Specifically, we will evaluate expression of the candidate stress-related factors and the global transcriptome changes in PFC. Aim 3 will identify alterations in stress-associated molecules in peripheral blood samples collected from two independent prospective cohorts and compare the human results with those from the mouse models. The project will determine alteration in stress-related molecular expression induced by genetic mutations, leading to impaired PFC maturation during adolescence and adult behavioral consequences, which may underlie susceptibility to detrimental effects of adolescent social isolation. Our project will facilitate future development of prognostic measures and biomarkers to help identify prodromal signs of the disease."

Furthermore, veterinary researchers play a key role in comparative and translational research activities since they naturally bridge basic and clinical research. To address this training need, faculty in the Center for Comparative Medicine and Translational Research (CCMTR) at the College of Veterinary Medicine, North Carolina State University established the Comparative Medicine and Translational Research Training Program (CMTRTP). This training program specifically targets individuals with the DVM degree who have completed specialty training. Trainees complete requirements leading to the PhD degree in laboratories of well-funded faculty that have a strong track training record and diverse research expertise. Research projects emphasize comparative and translational themes fostered by the CCMTR and trainees participate in multidisciplinary research efforts. Trainees bridge research programs and serve as a nidus for new faculty collaborations. The training program was initiated in Fall 2007 with funds for 2 slots committed by North Carolina State University. Funding from an NIH T32 in 2008 enabled the program to grow to a total of 8 training slots. To date, we have recruited 12 outstanding trainees who by all accounts, are talented clinician scientists when the complete the program. For this renewal application, six trainee slots are requested in Year 1 of the next grant period to restore the NIH funded slots to the original level and 2 will be supported from NC State resources. We propose to grow the program to a total of 9 training slots by adding 1 additional NIH slot in Year 2. Program requirements include: (1) a capstone course on comparative medicine and translational research; (2) a professional development courses and workshops; (3) a seminar series on translational research; (4) a course in research ethics; (5) a pilot grant program that will culminate in submission of a K award proposal; and (6) an annual research symposium. These requirements are in addition to those associated with a student's graduate program. This novel training program will build upon the strong commitment and track record of the NC State CVM to train veterinary specialists in research."

"9384076","Abstract:   Accumulation of beta?amyloid (A?) in brain extracellular parenchyma and fluid is the key event in the amyloid cascade leading to neuronal cell damage in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The blood?brain barrier (BBB) between the blood and brain interstitial fluid and the blood-CSF barrier (BCB) between the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) play an important role in maintaining the homeostasis of A? in brain extracellular milieu. Since the brain barrier systems are the known targets of Pb toxicity, it is quite possible that Pb toxicity on brain barriers may affect the critical processes in brain barrier systems that regulate A? transport and metabolism. Thus, the central hypothesis to be tested in this study is that exposure to Pb damages the brain barrier systems, which compromises the clearance and eventually increases the leakage of A? at the BBB and BCB, facilitates the physiochemical reactions between A? and Pb ions, ultimately leading to an increased formation of amyloid plaques in both brains and blood vessels. To test this hypothesis, we have designed three sets of specific aims. In aim 1, we will use the state?of?the?art dynamic contrast? enhanced computed tomography (DCE?CT) to quantify the real?time brain regional blood flow, blood volume, and BBB  permeability before and after Pb exposure in Tg?APP mice which overexpress A?  and have the detectable amyloid  plaques in brain as well as WT mice. We will also characterize the shift of fibril A? deposits from the brain's capillary vessels to its parenchyma as a result of Pb exposure in a dose?time dependent fashion. We will focus on expressions of two transporters, RAGE and LRP?1, in the BBB treated with Pb. The experiments in Aim 2 will focus on the role of two A?   transporters, i.e., lipoprotein receptor protein?1 (LRP1) and advanced glycation end products (RAGE) in mediating A?   transport by mainly the BCB, and how Pb exposure may affect the direction of A?  transport across the BCB. Finally, in Aim 3, we will use synchrotron X?ray fluorescence (XRF) imaging technique coupled with immunohistochemistry to co? localize Pb with amyloidal aggregates and K X?ray fluorescence (KXRF) technique quantify real?time Pb concentrations in bone (PbBn) and to establish the association between PbBn and amyloid aggregation in brain and blood vessels after Pb exposure at different doses and time. These studies will establish a novel concept that the brain barriers play a key role in regulating Pb?induced brain A? oligomers and plaques as well as in blood vessels. We will also establish the relationship between Pb exposure and permeability changes of brain barriers to A? fluxes and provide clues as to whether chronic Pb exposure and changes in cerebral vascular permeability contribute to AD pathogenesis and development. The research will help develop the novel strategies for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of AD.        PHS 398/2590 (Rev. 06/09) Page 1 Continuation Format Page"
"9360116","ABSTRACT  Neuronal spike-trains and various other signals in the central nervous system have a discrete, impulsive nature that is well characterized with point process statistical models. In several neuroscience applications, such impulsive signals are transformed upon interaction with biological processes or measurement artifacts, and are consequently observed as filtered point process data. The goal of this project is to develop a principled statistical signal processing framework for filtered point processes with models and algorithms for estimation and inference, and to apply these novel methodologies to experimental data from rodent brain calcium imaging data and human neuroendocrine data. Our approach centers on a unified framework for sparse representation and dynamical systems modeling of marked point process data arising in neuroscience analyses. In addition to its novel statistical methodology, another major strength of our proposal is the application of these methods to experimental data arising in fundamental neuroscience and clinical problems, both to validate the new methods with real data and to investigate basic science questions related to the central nervous system structural and functional organization. Large-scale two-photon calcium imaging, in conjunction with spike-train deconvolution, will allow us to study the activity of over a thousand identified neurons simultaneously with single-spike resolution in a behaving animal. This will allow us to elucidate with high accuracy how the magnitude and spatial structure of signal and noise correlations across neurons vary with stimuli or behavioral tasks. It will shed light on visual encoding in the rodent brain, and neuronal architectures underlying visual perception and cognition, at an unprecedented spatiotemporal scale. Further, our modeling of pulsatile hormone secretion will apply to the release of cortisol, gonadal steroids, insulin, thyroid and growth hormones. Diseases linked to abnormal cortisol secretion include diabetes, visceral obesity and osteoporosis, disturbed memory formation and life-threatening Addisonian crisis. Hence, understanding and modeling the underlying impulsive nature of normal hormone release will aid our understanding of pathological neuroendocrine states and improve the efficacy of drugs and other interventions for treatment of hormonal disorders. Additionally, this project will combine Brown Lab?s computational expertise in point process models with Sur Lab?s experimental expertise in neuronal calcium imaging, extending our ongoing collaboration under the NIH Brain Initiative to developing novel neural population analysis techniques with unprecedented detail at single-neuron, single-spike resolution. Our research is well poised to improve significantly the state of the art and in computational and systems neuroscience tools and bridge together components from the statistical learning, signal processing and computational neuroscience communities to produce a unifying analytical framework for neural data analysis."
"9351671","Accidental leaks from manufacturing plants are common and large groups of people may be exposed to high halogen (Cl2/Br2) concentrations. Use of halogen gases as chemical weapons is also on the rise. Victims of accidental bromine exposure experience respiratory distress, cardiac arrest and circulatory collapse. Studies evaluating acute and chronic sequelae of Br2 exposure are scant and treatment remains symptomatic as no effective countermeasures exist. Our studies have established that the heart is severely injured in animals that survive high dose halogen (Cl2/Br2) inhalation. The purpose of this application is to identify the biological mechanisms responsible for these events and develop appropriate countermeasures. Based on exciting preliminary data we propose that brominated reactants such as brominated lipids are produced in the lungs. Brominated reactants/lipids reach the heart along with oxygenated blood. These reactants inactivate important calcium pumps that regulate the heartbeats. Inactivity of calcium pumps causes calcium accumulation or ?calcium overload? in the heart cells. Calcium overload is a serious problem and can lead to sudden cardiac death. Increased calcium also activates destructive proteins, the calpains that destroy cardiac ultrastructure. We therefore hypothesize that Br2 inhalation produces highly reactive intermediates that activate Ca2+ sensitive calpains leading to cytoskeletal and mitochondrial damage and myocardial dysfunction and that calpain inhibition will mitigate Br2-induced cardiopulmonary dysfunction and death. These hypotheses will be tested by completing the experiments outlined in the following specific aims. SA#1: Characterize cardiac injury and death induced by Br2 inhalation. SA#2: Test the hypothesis that Br2 and Br2 reactants activate cardiac calpains and cause cytoskeletal and mitochondrial damage. SA#3: Test whether calpain inhibitor based countermeasures mitigate acute and chronic effects caused by Br2 inhalation. The outcome from this project will identify an effective antidote for bromine toxicity and enhance readiness for emergencies arising from accidental or intentional exposures."
"9334431","ABSTRACT. Smoking rates in Vietnam are one of the highest in the world. Promoting cessation is the key to reversing current global trends in tobacco-related mortality. Yet, there is a lack of smoking cessation interventions demonstrating efficacy in low middle-income countries (LMICs) like Vietnam. To increase smoking cessation rates and reduce smoking prevalence, programs need to be easily accessible, adapted to the local context and culture and reach large populations of smokers. Mobile phone interventions that use text messaging or short message systems (SMS) meet these criteria and are particularly well suited to address behaviors like smoking because messages can be tailored to individual needs and provide assistance in a smoker's natural environment. There is growing support for the efficacy of text-based smoking cessation interventions, but these studies have largely taken place in Western countries. The objective of this study is to develop and test the feasibility and acceptability of a smoking cessation SMS intervention adapted to the sociocultural context, language and communication styles of Vietnamese smokers. We propose a multi method three-stage approach to develop and test the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary effect on cessation outcomes of a SMS smoking cessation intervention among Vietnamese smokers. First, through surveys and focus groups we will linguistically and culturally adapt a text message library for Vietnamese smokers (AIM 1). Second, we will pretest of the SMS message intervention protocol with 40 subjects to examine, in real time using ecological momentary assessment, and post intervention qualitative interviews, preferences related to message content, frequency, and timing and make additional adaptations based on participant feedback (AIM 2). Finally, we will use the AIM 2 findings to refine the intervention and assess feasibility, acceptability and biochemically validated 3 month cessation rates in a two-arm randomized controlled pilot study comparing the SMS intervention with an assessment only control group (n=100) (AIM 3). We will also implement a program to build research capacity through mentorship, training and applied research experience. This project is significant in that it leverages the growth of mobile phone use in Vietnam to introduce an innovative and promising cessation intervention that has high potential for population level impact. Consistent with the purpose of the R21 funding mechanism, the expected outcomes of the project will provide a solid basis for a larger-scale trial testing a text message intervention informed by findings from this research."

Support provided by the core includes both routine and specialized services to meet the need of DC-IDDRC investigators. The genomics services include conventional technologies (expression, SNP and methylation arrays) and newly implemented next-generation sequencing (NGS) of DNA/RNA on Illumina and Pacific BioSystems platforms. For the proteomics components, the core has standardized highly innovative and sensitive quantitative proteomic techniques using a combination of stable isotope labeling by amino acid in cell culture (SILAC) and in vivo in mice (SILAM), and provided them as services to DC-IDDRC investigators. Supported research projects include studies on neurodevelopmental disorders, brain injury (especially fetal and neonatal), and genetic disorders. A major strength of the GPC is the continuous upgrade of instrumentation and methods to keep pace with rapidly changing technology and investigator needs. Critical to this new U54 application, the GPC will help investigators transition their basic, translational and clinical research projects from bench to bedside. A close collaboration with the new Clinical Translational Core, as well as other DC-IDDRC Cores as needed, will facilitate this goal. One example, which is the focus of this new RFA, is development of noninvasive biomarkers to monitor disease progression and response to therapies in clinical trials. The core has developed highly accurate and highly multiplexed methods for discovery and validation of biomarkers in IDD-related diseases. We also propose a broad strategy for multi- level integrative analysis of ?omics? data, from DNA to proteins, utilizing substantial established computational infrastructure, together with newly emerging tools. Pipelines developed as part of this effort will be freely available through deposition in public resources. Overall, the objectives of the GPC are to: 1. Deliver individualized, full service, cost-effective assistance in state-of-the-art genomic and proteomic technologies to investigators engaged in research relevant to IDD; 2. Implement novel and emerging ?omics? approaches to enhance IDDR at the DC-IDDRC, and provide training and education about these technologies to DC-IDDRC investigators; and 3. Synergize and collaborate with other DC-IDDRC cores, DC-IDDRC investigators, the focused research project, and other IDDRCs to strengthen and enhance multidisciplinary IDDR."
"9387775","Project Summary/Abstract:  Coxiella burnetii is a Gram-negative, obligate intracellular, macrophage-tropic bacterium and the causative agent of the zoonotic disease Q fever. Acute phase of the disease in humans is characterized primarily by influenza-like symptoms, and approximately 3-5% of the infected individuals develop chronic infection, which is characterized by endocarditis. Association between host genetic background and the development of Coxiella infection has been demonstrated both in humans and animals; however, specific genes associated with susceptibility to infection remain largely unknown. A powerful tool to study the impact of host genetics on pathogenic infection is the model organism Drosophila melanogaster. The Drosophila Genetics Reference Panel (DGRP) is a fully sequenced panel of fly lines derived from a natural population that is used to as a living library to test how polymorphisms affect complex host responses. Thus, to address the knowledge gap regarding how host genetics affects Coxiella pathogenesis, we propose to identify host genetic variants implicated in susceptibility to Coxiella infection using Drosophila melanogaster.  Our preliminary data demonstrate that Drosophila exhibit mortality and host immune responses following infection with the BSL2 phase II clone 4 strain of C. burnetii that has a deletion in lipopolysaccharide synthesis genes but retains other virulence factors. The phase II strain has similar intra-macrophage replication kinetics as BSL3 phase I C. burnetii and causes lethality in wax moth larvae. Similarly, Drosophila succumb to Coxiella phase II clone 4 and thus can be used as a novel host model for Coxiella infection. Moreover, our pathway-unbiased screening approach will significantly improve upon ongoing studies of Coxiella in mammalian systems. We hypothesize that the DGRP lines will reveal genetic variants in immune response- related genes associated with susceptibility to Coxiella infection. In Specific Aim 1 we will use DGRP lines to perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and screen for genetic variants associated with susceptibility to Coxiella infection. In Specific Aim 2 we will use genetically recombinant fly lines and in vitro assays to knockdown or over-express genes with identified variants for validation and further functional evaluation of the gene's impact on Coxiella pathogenesis. Additionally, since a majority of known human disease genes have recognizable homologues in Drosophila, we will take advantage of these genetic similarities to ask how homologous genes identified in our screen function during Coxiella infection in human cells.  Through the proposed work we will identify host genetic determinants of susceptibility to Coxiella infection in Drosophila and mammalian hosts. Our findings will have broad-ranging impacts by identifying host factors that when dysfunctional confer susceptibility to Coxiella infection. These results will be important for better prediction of pathogen spread in domestic ruminant reservoirs and disease progression in humans."

"9316170","Title: Workplace Wellness Climate and Substance Abuse Prevention in Small Businesses: A Cluster Randomized Trial and Psychometric Analysis  Project Summary (Abstract)  Many economic costs of alcohol and other drug (AOD) use stem from decreased productivity due to worker absences and illness. While most of the research is conducted in large organizations, small businesses need the most assistance. The Small Business Wellness Initiative (SBWI) was implemented to adapt and evaluate the Team Awareness program. Team Awareness is based on a concept of workplace prevention that targets risk and protective factors at three levels: employee, workgroup, and organization. At the organizational level, Team Awareness targets both risk factors (e.g., drinking culture that tolerates drinking on the job) and protective climates (e.g., perceived coworker practices of exercise, healthy eating, and temperate drinking) as these are assumed to either promote or prevent AOD risks. Though there is evidence that these climate factors are associated with substance use and health outcomes, extant studies have only analyzed climate at the individual-level of perceptions, and have focused on risky climates. This proposal identifies a protective and group-aggregated measure of climate, organizational wellness, posited to reduce the risks of illness and absences due to substance use and other unhealthy behavior. The organizational wellness climate (OWC) measure and other established climate measures were assessed with questionnaires administered at three time periods during the SBWI. The proposed project has two aims: (1) examine the factor structure of the climate questionnaire and determine the most reliable and valid brief organizational wellness climate measure that can be distinguished from other climate factors, and (2) test the impact of a substance abuse prevention programs on organizational-level climate and individual-level AOD risk in small businesses. The identification and validation of a new short-form organizational wellness climate measure can help researchers and businesses in their health promotion and AOD prevention efforts. By testing a model of prevention effectiveness, this study will contribute to scientific understanding of how to intervene to create healthy work climates, reduce AOD risk, and improve health in the underserved population of small businesses."
"9350169","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Pediatric obesity is a public health crisis that is taking a dramatic toll on our nation's health and resources. Gold-standard treatment for pediatric obesity is family-based behavioral weight loss treatment (FBT). However, weight regain following FBT is common given the abundance of unhealthy prompts in the US obesogenic environment. The NIH has called for designing and testing interventions to achieve and maintain a healthy weight. Toward this end, two weight loss maintenance interventions were evaluated by Wilfley and colleagues in a randomized controlled trial of youth with overweight or obesity and their parents (NICHD R01 HD036904; Wilfley et al., 2007). Results showed that, following FBT, a social facilitation weight loss maintenance intervention (SFM) and a behavioral skills weight loss maintenance intervention (BSM) produced greater weight loss maintenance than a control condition, and SFM was superior to BSM. The critical next question is to examine which intervention strategy offers the greatest value. Thus, the overarching aim of this proposal is to evaluate the comparative cost-effectiveness of SFM, BSM, and the control condition for children and parents on changes in BMI units reduced over two years (Aim 1), depressive symptoms and binge eating behaviors reduced over two years (Aim 2), and on obesity-related health benefits and health care costs over 10 years (Aim 3). The microsimulation cost-effectiveness model will be based on a newly published approach from the largest economic evaluation of pediatric obesity interventions. Evaluation of the cost per changes in depression and binge eating is included because psychosocial changes from treatment have been neglected in prior cost-effectiveness analyses of pediatric obesity intervention, despite the impact of depression and binge eating on weight status, disability, and quality of life in youth with obesity. The proposed study and training plan enhances my program of research (a) evaluating the efficacy of behavioral interventions for obesity and weight-related issues, and (b) investigating factors that impact adoption and implementation of evidence-based behavioral interventions into routine practice. The rich educational environment of The University of Chicago will equip me with a strong theoretical and methodological foundation in cost-effectiveness analysis to conduct this translational research project and will expand my capacity to comprehensively evaluate behavioral interventions. Expertise of the mentorship team ensures this project will be successful. The goal of this work is to inform meaningful decisions regarding adoption of family- based weight loss maintenance strategies for the treatment of obesity, which has the potential to advance sustainable solutions for obesity care. In doing so, we facilitate efforts to ensure all individuals live healthy and productive lives. In summary, this NRSA would afford protected time for mentored postdoctoral training in cost- effectiveness analysis, which is critical for achieving my goal of being an independent investigator focused on testing, implementing, and increasing access to intervention delivery for obesity and weight-related issues."
"9347069","Compared to uninfected subjects, HIV-infected subjects continue to experience an increased incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) despite well-controlled viral replication on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Some antiretroviral drugs ? such as abacavir and some protease inhibitors ? have been associated with even higher ASCVD risk. Furthermore, ASCVD risk scores underestimate the ASCVD risk among HIV-infected subjects. This likely suggests that there are unmeasured factors contributing to the increased risk associated with HIV and/or ART. One such potential mechanism is the down-regulation of cholesterol efflux from arterial wall macrophages which as been documented in HIV infection. The impairment of cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) by HIV may be partially reversed by ART. We have demonstrated that impaired CEC is an ASCVD risk factor in the general population, independent of traditional risk factors including HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. In the proposed analyses we will characterize the clinical relevance of CEC as a cardiovascular biomarker in patients with controlled HIV infection on ART, and determine the impact of various antiretroviral drugs on CEC. We propose to achieve this by measuring CEC in HIV-infected participants of a large AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) cohort: the Longitudinally Linked Randomized Trials (ALLRT) to establish the association between baseline HDL cholesterol efflux and incident ASCVD among patients with controlled HIV infection on stable ART. We will do so by measuring CEC in ALLRT participants with incident ASCVD and a 5:1 random- sample cohort who remained free of ASCVD utilizing a case-cohort study design. We will then examine whether addition of CEC to traditional risk factor scoring algorithms will improve the risk prediction of incident ASCVD in this population. Finally, we will determine whether different antiretroviral drugs are associated with lower or higher CEC by: a) comparing CEC between ALLRT participants receiving abacavir-containing versus tenofovir-containing, and protease inhibitors-containing versus non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors- containing antiretroviral regimens; c) conducting in-vitro comparisons of CEC between sera from antiretroviral naïve HIV-infected and non-HIV infected subjects exposed to various first-line antiretroviral drugs. ALLRT is a large cohort of HIV-infected patients that initiated ART as part of randomized clinical trials, with adjudicated cardiovascular events over long-term follow up, making it an ideal cohort for the proposed work. We have already measured the CEC and determined its association with incident ASCVD in the DHS. Taken together, results of this study could significantly advance understanding of the mechanisms of increased ASCVD risk associated with HIV and ART and refine ASCVD risk prediction in this high-risk population, results with immediate clinical implications. They could also form the basis for further research in mitigating that risk and establish a new basis for the evaluation of the ASCVD risk of current and future antiretroviral drugs."
"9381650","Project Summary Pore-forming membrane channels are central mediators of many complex biological phenomena; such as synchronizing the contraction of our heart and electro-chemical signals in our brain, and detecting light, sound, touch, taste and smells of the world around us. This ability is dependent upon dynamic mechanism used to spatially and temporally modulate their cellular activity. Our research group is focused on understanding how these types of phenomena are choreographed by remarkably complex strategies of cell-to-cell communication, through the gap junctions. We aim to develop a molecular and atomic-level of mechanistic understanding of how gap junctions coordinate inter-cellular communication. To achieve this level of detail, we are combining the unique power of electron cryo-microscopy (CryoEM), together with targeted biophysical and functional studies to address several fundamental questions, such as: i) How do the gap junctions selectively control the flow of chemical information between cells? ii) How are their activities allosterically modulated by physiological cues? iii) How are cell-signaling platforms used to effectively control channel activity in a native multi-cellular environment? Despite their physiological and medical relevance, membrane proteins still only represent ~4% of the protein structure database. However, recent advances in the field of high-resolution single particle CryoEM, coupled with advancements in membrane protein biochemistry, are beginning to revolutionize the way we structurally characterize these proteins. With these technological tools in hand, we are addressing several key questions about gap junction selectivity and regulation. The results of our investigations are expected to provide an architectural framework and the mechanistic knowledge required for the development of targeted therapies against a range of gap junction related diseases, such as blindness, deafness, arrhythmia, stroke and cancers.!"
"9358709","This goal of this application is to establish a clinical center at Johns Hopkins University in the MACH14 trial. The effects of drinking alcohol within recommended limits on risks of CVD, diabetes, and related diseases are perhaps the most important questions yet to be answered in the fields of alcohol, nutrition, or prevention. Epidemiological studies have consistently found that alcohol intake within recommended limits is associated with lower risk of coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and diabetes, yet no long-term randomized trial of alcohol consumption on risk of any chronic disease has yet been performed. In direct response to PAR-16-363 (Multi-Site Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial Research Center on Alcohol's Health Effects), we propose a worldwide, six-year, balanced-design randomized trial, comparing the effects of one standard serving (~14 grams) of alcohol intake daily to abstention on risk of CVD, diabetes, mortality, and related outcomes among 7,800 adults at above-average cardiovascular risk worldwide. To maximize feasibility and reflect actual use most closely, we propose to test alcohol consumption per se to abstention and thus to offer participants flexibility in their choice of beverage, while employing novel and intensive yet efficient methods to monitor safety. The Primary Specific Aim of this trial is to determine the effects of 14 gm of alcohol intake daily compared with abstention on risk of major cardiovascular events or death (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hospitalized angina, need for revascularization, or death) over an average of 6 years of follow-up among 7,800 adults aged ?50 years with estimated 10-year CVD risk ?15% or prevalent CVD >6 months prior to enrollment. Secondary Aims will test the effects of alcohol on risks of incident diabetes and major cardiovascular events. Tertiary Aims will test risks of hard cardiovascular events and progression to impaired fasting glucose. Similar to other large randomized trials, we will establish ~16 centers worldwide using a stepped approach, with a 9-month vanguard phase among 7 centers in the US, Europe, Africa, and South America (in this application), followed by a second wave of additional sites to complete enrollment. Participants will be monitored for safety in multiple complementary ways, including brief electronic real-time reporting and validated yearly instruments and laboratory measures. We have brought together highly successful groups in the US and Europe to establish clinical, data, and biospecimen coordinating centers, our field centers include many of the most experienced clinical trialists anywhere, and our group has strong working relationships with NIAAA and other NIH staff necessary to ensure seamless collaboration during a U10-funded cooperative research endeavor. In this application, we propose the first randomized clinical trial of alcohol consumption, aiming to determine whether it increases or decreases the risk of CVD and diabetes among adults at above-average cardiovascular risk worldwide."
"9348391","Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated as a contributing factor for heart failure. Genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and quality control such as the peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor gamma coactivator 1? (PGC-1?) have been severely downregulated in rodent models of heart failure. Transcription of PGC-1? can be promoted when cAMP Response Element Binding Protein (CREB) is phosphorylated at Ser-133 by PKA upon beta-adrenergic signaling. However, recent evidence shows that CREB itself has numerous factors modulating it, including phosphorylation on other sites (e.g Ser-142), availability of dimerization partners (c- Jun, CREB subtypes) and other co-factors (e.g. TORCs) that may be altered in heart failure. Here we will test whether bypassing the complex regulatory steps involved in PGC-1? activation and directly targeting cAMP Response Elements (CRE) known to regulate PGC-1? gene expression can have beneficial effects on expression of PGC-1?. Importantly, we also propose to test whether mitochondrial biogenesis can be increased via CRE-mediated PGC-1? upregulation. I intend to utilize the newly developed CRISPR/Cas9 technology as a transcriptional activator (instead of editing genes, with inactivated Cas9 fused to transcriptional activation domains) to target CRE sequences to promote transcription of PGC-1?. Use and efficacy of these gene modulating tools has not been evaluated in cardiomyocytes. With this project, I will establish if metabolic reprogramming and enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis can be effected with CRISPR-mediated activation of PGC-1? while providing fundamental knowledge of the role of CRE in PGC-1? activation and mitochondrial function. I would have also developed a streamlined and generalizable method for using gene modulating tools for expression and begun to test its efficacy in preventing or reversing heart failure."
"9238066","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This competing renewal application, U01 AA013521, Neuroimaging of Alcohol-Induced Neuroadaptation: Translation from Animals to Humans, is submitted in response to RFA-AA-16-004 (U01). The overarching aim of this proposal is to identify in vivo markers related to the pathogenesis of alcohol use disorder (AUD) related to altered stress (amygdala) circuitry and neuroimmune recruitment. Recent resting- state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) studies will determine the differential circuitry of the amygdala as a function of withdrawal frequency in AUD. The potential for neuroimmune recruitment in AUD pathology will be evaluated using a multi-B-value diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) analysis of free water, which is proposed as an index of neuroinflammation. These in vivo biomarkers will be collected in humans, monkeys, and rodents and contribute to the validity of the animal models and provide a framework for evaluating pharmacological agents to aid in AUD recovery. Optogenetic stimulated functional MRI in rodents will further explore specific brain circuits relevant to AUD. Specific Aim 1 will use rs-fMRI and multi-B-value DTI in humans with AUD and their controls to test the hypothesis that greater withdrawal frequency will be associated with more symptoms of anxiety, changes in amygdala rs-fMRI connectivity (stronger functional connectivity between the CMA and anterior cingulate cortex [ACC] and between BLA and anterior insula; weaker connectivity between the CMA and posterior cingulate cortex [PCC]), and more free water in amygdala, hippocampus, and cingulate cortex. Specific Aim 2 will analyze rs-fMRI and multi-B-value DTI data in monkeys at baseline and following 3 cycles of EtOH exposure and withdrawal collected by INIA-Stress to test the hypothesis that greater withdrawal frequency will be associated with exacerbated anxiety, higher EtOH consumption, changes in amygdala rs-fMRI connectivity, and more free water in amygdala, hippocampus, and cingulate cortex. Specific Aim 3 will rs-fMRI and multi-B-value DTI in rats exposed to chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) via vapor chambers to test the hypothesis that longer periods of CIE will result in the accrual of anxiety-like behavior, stronger functional connectivity between the amygdala and downstream targets (e.g., brainstem), and more free water in amygdala, hippocampus, and cingulate cortex. It is also hypothesized that apremilast, a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor will normalize affected behavioral, functional, and free water changes, thereby supporting neuroimmune mechanisms in AUD. Specific Aim 4 will use optogenetic and chemogenetic methods and fMRI to determine the neurocircuitry recruited by direct stimulation of the rat central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) neurons. The hypothesis to be tested is that direct stimulation of CeA CRF neurons will result in similar functional connectivity patterns as observed following multiple CIE exposures."

"9361550","ABSTRACT Proteinuria, commonly caused by podocyte dysfunction or injury, is an invariable finding in patients with glomerular disease and is by itself a risk factor for long-term prognosis. Evidence suggests that the multi- tasking melanocortin hormone system plays a protective role in stress response in multiple organ systems, including the kidney. The clinical effectiveness of melanocortin therapy with adrenocorticotropin in inducing remission of steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome points to a steroidogenic-independent anti-proteinuric activity of the melanocortinergic pathway. By harnessing the naturally occurring loss-of-function mutations in melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) in both humans and mice, our latest study demonstrated that MC1R is likely dispensable for the proteinuria-reducing and podocyte protective effect of melanocortin therapy. Rather, we found that MC5R is predominantly expressed in glomerular podocytes in vivo and in vitro, and MC5R agonists seem to confer a podocyte protective effect. Building on our previous work, this study will examine the role of the MC5R-mediated melanocortinergic pathway in regulating podocyte injury, explore the sites and modes of action and test an entirely novel strategy for treating proteinuric glomerulopathies based on targeting this pathway. Aim 1 will define and validate the role of MC5R versus MC1R in mediating the anti-proteinuric and podocyte protective effect by comparing the therapeutic efficacy of diverse melanocortins in wild-type, MC1R- null and MC5R knockout (MC5R-/-) mice with Adriamycin nephropathy or nephrotoxic serum nephritis. The contribution of hematopoietic MC5R to the beneficial effect of melanocortin therapy will be assessed in MC5R-/- mice receiving adoptive transfer of syngeneic wild-type bone marrow-derived cells. Furthermore, the podocyte autonomous effect of MC5R will be examined in MC5R-/- mice with podocyte specific MC5R reconstitution. Aim 2 will explore the mechanisms underlying the podocyte protective effect of MC5R signaling. How melanocortin treatment affects podocyte death, cytoskeleton disorganization and expression of NF?B-dependent podocytopathic mediators will be assessed in conditionally immortalized and primary podocytes. The essential role of MC5R will be defined using primary MC5R-/- podocytes and those with MC5R reconstitution. Studies will further examine if the podocyte protective effect of MC5R signaling is conveyed by inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3?, a key transducer of MC5R signaling and a point of convergence for multiple pathways involved in podocyte injury. Aim 3 will test the rescue effect of a novel and highly selective MC5R agonist on established podocyte injury elicited by Adriamycin or nephrotoxic serum in mice and by puromycin aminonucleoside in rats. The mechanisms responsible for the podocyte protective effect of melanocortinergic signaling will be validated in vivo. Collectively, these studies will provide a mechanistic view of the role of the melanocortinergic pathway in regulating podocyte injury and may pave the way for clinical trials of melanocortin based therapy to improve podocyte injury, induce proteinuria remission and slow progression of glomerulosclerosis in man."

The CIMC also acquired and developed the infrastructure and expertise to study cellular metabolism, including oxygen consumption and acidification rates, mitochondrial function; and the detection of immune mediators through multiplex approaches. Therefore, state-of-the-art services of the CIMC are very well suited to support the needs of PJIs of the new Phase I COBRE application ?Center for translational Viral Oncology? (CTVO). This will be done by fully utilizing present services and resources, and by expending their expertise to identify new biomarkers for virus-induced cancer, evaluation of cell growth and cell death responses associated with the expression of viral oncoproteins and anticancer treatment. In addition, innovative approaches, which are continuously implemented by the CIMC personnel will allow PJIs and their mentors to develop new experimental strategies explaining virus-induced changes at the levels of tumor cell signaling, epigenetic regulation and tumor cell energy metabolism, thereby increasing their chances for high impact publications and federal and foundation-related funding. These advanced technologies have positioned the CIMC as the leading laboratory in cancer and immunology in the region, which has resulted in an increased number of users, including PJIs of the CTVO, and its integration as a core laboratory at the LSUHSC School of Medicine and the LSU-Cancer Center. ! !"
"9335411","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lead exposure threatens the health of millions of children, yet it is entirely preventable health problem. Our project objective is to develop an advanced blood lead test to identify and protect those at risk through blood lead screening tests of children. Even very low lead exposure, measured by blood lead levels, causes irreversible damage, especially in very young children, resulting in decreased IQ, learning disabilities, attention deficit disorders, behavioral problems, stunted growth and other serious individual and societal problems. The US Department of Health and Human Services has established an ambitious goal of eliminating lead poisoning in children. The Centers for Disease Control has lowered the level of blood lead that calls for concern down to 5 µg/dL, with predictions of settin a lower level of concern in the near future. It is generally agreed that no level of lead exposure s safe. To aid in this public health effort, we propose to develop a new, needed, clinical blood lead test. The Aims of our Phase II research and development project are to produce and validate a low- cost diagnostic product by (Aim 1) developing an innovative 8 sensor platform capable of sensor-based measurement of blood lead levels, by (Aim 2) developing the platform to meet current and emerging needs of accuracy and precision over the entire range of measurement for child tests down to blood lead levels of 1 µg/ dL using a single drop of blood, by (Aim 3) producing a new proprietary Metexchange(r) reagent, containing no toxic chemicals that effectively lyse RBC and releases Pb2+ for sensitive and accurate ASV analysis of blood lead levels over the entire clinical range, without bias to Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (GFAAS), and by (Aim 4) validating accurate, precise and sensitive measurements of total lead levels in clinical blood specimens over the entire range, equal to or better than GFAAS.

We have completed proof-of-concept studies in mice, rats and non-human primates, demonstrating that BDNF prevents entorhinal cortical neuronal cell loss, enhances synaptic markers, reverses molecular and biochemical features associated with AD, and improves learning and memory. These effects extend into the hippocampus, thereby treating key memory circuitry of the brain. Importantly, this approach provides a much-needed alternative to amyloid-modifying therapeutics currently under development, providing future possibilities for combined therapies if both prove to be partly effective. We propose gene delivery of BDNF because of the need to administer this protein directly into the brain and sustain its delivery over time. In the proposed  work plan, we will manufacture adeno-associated virus serotype 2 (AAV2) vectors expressing human BDNF at a GMP facility, then use this clinical-grade material to perform IND-enabling studies in two species (rat and primates). In addition, we will generate expertise in accurately targeting and delivering AAV2-BDNF to the primate entorhinal cortex using real-time, MR-guided imaging. The following aims will be performed: Aim 1: Produce AAV2-BDNF for IND-enabling safety/toxicity/dosing studies. Aim 2: Optimize AAV2-BDNF gene delivery to the entorhinal cortex in non-human primates using convection-enhanced delivery and real-time MR guidance. Aim 3: Safety/toxicity/dosing/biodistribution studies in rodents and non-human primates. Aim 4: Draft and Submit an IND Application. Relevance: Successful completion of this work will lead to clinical translation of a new approach to prevent cell loss and stimulate neural function in a common, severe and disabling neurodegenerative disorder."

"9363115","Identification of cancer drug targets using high throughput screens of tumor cell lines has led to a number of agents presently in clinical trials. In addition, recent advances in drugs that attack immune cells within tumors, such as ?CTLA4 and ?PD-1, have highlighted the importance of immune modulation as a strategy for cancer therapy. The next phase of cancer drug target discovery will seek to integrate these strategies to identify combinations of drugs that most efficiently target both tumor cells and the immune components in advanced cancers. The goal of this proposal is to identify and validate these combinations using large-scale data mining and mouse pre-clinical cancer models that mimic the major genetic features of human cancer. This proposal addresses both mechanisms of immune escape by a) finding genetic targets that may enhance tumor mutation load, and b) carrying out high throughout screens in T cells or myeloid cells for targets that promote immune cell infiltration. We will exploit unique mouse models that mirror major genetic categories of human cancer ? high vs low mutation load, and strong vs weak immune infiltrate. Applying single-cell RNAseq and mass cytometric proteomic analyses, cutting edge immune composition databases and novel computational network approaches to cancer target discovery using existing large databases, we propose to identify vulnerabilities addressed by combining small molecule drugs with immunotherapy. We will make immunologically ?cold? tumors, that do not engage the immune system, into ?hot? tumors that present more or stronger antigens, or that encourage infiltration by immune effector cells. To achieve this goal, we propose three highly innovative aims centered on perturbation of specific targets: first by a CRISP/Cas9 screen in immune cells of the tumor microenvironment, second through increasing antigen load in tumors to optimize immune recognition and finally through a network-based identification of tumor-expressed targets that may confer susceptibility to existing immune-oncology therapies. This represents a true `network' of our collective expertise as well as a measured collection of candidate and screening approaches. AIM 1 ?We will perform CRISPR screens in monocytes and T-cells to identify genes associated with tumor entry and function in two distinct tumor types. AIM 2? We will use genetic or pharmacological perturbation of newly generated candidate genes involved in metabolic stress and ROS-induced DNA damage to increase mutation load and antigen abundance in a tumor- specific manner, leading to improved responses to immunotherapy. AIM 3 ? We will exploit gene expression networks to identify druggable targets and pathways that augment immune responses. This proposal identifies pathways and perturbants for accelerating immunotherapies."
"9471022","The sense of touch enables numerous behaviors fundamental to human existence, allowing individuals to eat, communicate and survive. With this sense, people can discern a surface's roughness, stickiness and vibration, among other attributes. A particularly critical dimension is object compliance. Interactions with compliant objects are pervasive in the world, whether with muscle and tissue, the hands of others, fruits and vegetables, or manufactured elastics. Despite prior psychophysical efforts to identify salient cues between the skin and complaint objects, very little is understood about the underlying neural codes. In particular, how can a diverse population of mechanosensory neurons encode perceptible differences in compliance ? given a rich diversity of stimulus-response transformations, conduction velocities, receptive field characteristics, densities and arrangements? This application's central hypothesis is that cues signaling compliance are reflected in the population response of different types of cutaneous mechanoreceptors, in time-dependent output based on spatial positioning. The hypothesis will be addressed by: i) establishing a new computational paradigm for the in silica generation and validation of population codes empowered by calcium imaging of populations of neurons combined with single-unit neurophysiology and ii) using this novel, intermediate observation point to understand how distinct, naturalistic properties of compliant stimuli are encoded in the periphery. This effort focuses on mouse somatosensory afferents innervating glabrous skin as a tractable mammalian system for computational, experimental and genetic studies."
"9474718","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Large inhalable particles exist in the workplace and can constitute a substantial amount of inhaled exposure (50% or more). Particles >30 mm primarily deposit in the oral and nasal cavities. Symptomatic health effects (acute or chronic rhinitis, chronic pharyngitis, chronic sinusitis, nasal cancer, and chronic laryngitis and gastro- intestinal diseases) occur in many industries, indicating the presence of these large inhalable particles. However, no instrument currently exists that is capable of measuring particle sizes between 30 and 100 mm. Large particles settle out quickly (terminal settling velocity of 100 mm particle = 0.3 m/s), requiring a real-time instrument to capture the timing and magnitude of the exposure. This project has three specific. The first aim is to design a portable inhalable particle spectrometer to measure inhalable aerosols as a function of particle size in real time. The second aim is to evaluate the sampling efficiency and other performance measures for this instrument in both calm air and low-wind speed environments. The third aim is to evaluate the size distribution of aerosols as a function of job task in two workplaces: a dairy parlor and in a machining shop. The outcome of this project will be an instrument capable of measuring inhalable aerosol size distributions. The ability to measure large inhalable particles will allow u to evaluate a hazard that up until now has remained un-quantified. Such measures will allow improved assessment of worker exposure, better selection of appropriate control methods, and thus, improvements to worker health. Successful development of the proposed instrument will enable researchers to make fast, accurate aerosol size distribution measurements with a small, lightweight, and relatively inexpensive device."
"9353771","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affects over 1 million Americans. Although in many circumstances medications have allowed us to gain control of disease, IBD still results in significant morbidity and mortality. One important genetic pathway identified in IBD is activated by a molecule called interleukin(IL)-23. Recently, a new type of lymphocyte, called an innate lymphoid cell (ILC), was discovered that responds to IL-23. The aim of this proposal is to support my additional research training to characterize the function and regulation of ILCs in IBD and help me transition to an independent research career focused on microbial regulation of immune cells in IBD. Dr. Dan Littman, an expert in the microbial regulation of intestinal immune cell activation, and Dr. Timothy Wang, an expert in microbial-dependent intestinal inflammation, will serve as co-mentors of this proposal. First, genetic material (i.e. RNA) from ILCs isolated from the intestines of patients with IBD (or non- IBD) donors will be defined using state-of-the-art sequencing technology. I will participate in formal training in sequence analysis in order to analyze this data and define genes/genetic pathways activated in intestinal ILCs of patients with IBD. The second main aspect of my proposal is to define the interaction of these intestinal ILCs with dendritic cells (DCs), specialized immune cells that capture proteins at sites of inflammation and present the processed protein to T cells to stimulate an immune response. Several types of DCs exist within the mouse intestine with different capacity to capture proteins and/or stimulate T cells. In order to investigate their interaction with ILCs, I will use novel mouse models generated in our lab that allow me to track particular DC subsets with a fluorescent label and to ablate specific DC subsets in a live mouse. Furthermore, I will characterize the DC subsets present in the human colon and evaluate their ability to interact with human intestinal ILCs in culture. Finally, this work will use germ-free mice to test the ability of particular bacteria from IBD and non-IBD donors to support ILC activity in mouse models of colitis. In order to provide scientific feedback and career development advice, I have assembled an Advisory Committee including Dr. Lloyd Mayer, an expert in IBD immunology; Dr. Megan Sykes, an expert in human immunology; Dr. Martin Blaser, an expert in intestinal microbiology; and Dr. Jaime Rubin, an expert in scientific research career development. With this scientific and career development plan, I believe this proposal will offer new insight into disease pathogenesis as well as diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for IBD and serve as a strong foundation for my transition to an independent research career."
"9519529","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The majority of smokers in the U.S. would like to quit. Despite declines in cigarette use during the past several decades, smoking remains common (21%) among U.S. adults and is the leading preventable cause of death. Tobacco control efforts have greatly reduced smoking prevalence (from 43% in 1964). However, extensive evidence shows that the decline in smoking prevalence has stagnated for the past 10 years. The reasons for this stagnation are unknown. While tobacco control efforts have been very successful, ultimately, these strategies may not reach all smokers. Therefore, the proposed study will examine whether the prevalence of specific factors that impede successful quitting have become more common among smokers over the past two decades. We will also examine potential pathways through which these factors may lead to persistent smoking. The results of this study will lead to a better understanding of the barriers to cessation among remaining smokers, informing the debate over how to lower the prevalence of smoking in the US."

"9355669","ABSTRACT The key function of the Neurogenomics Core (Core C, NGEN) is to insure access to state-of-the-art technologies for genetic research as applied to intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs). The availability of advanced genomics tools to gain insights into cellular processes is of major and increasing value in studies of these important conditions. There are significant challenges involved when a researcher wants to perform such assays for the first time, with challenges inherent to everything from project design through library preparation and data management and analysis. The NGEN Core is focused on providing priority services for IDDRC investigators and giving consultative services and training as needed. In the prior funding cycle the NGEN Core supported 15 NIH-funded researchers performing neurogenomics studies. The services used ranged from epigenomics to genomics through computational services. In collaboration with the ADM Core NGEN facilitates researchers getting preliminary data by making IDDRC Pilot Awards available on a competitive basis. We provide a robust computational environment for data management and analysis, and have activities that cut across the other cores of our IDDRC. The NGEN core is crafted from strong existing Einstein resources, exploiting an updated high performance computing facility as a novel component to the NGEN core. Genetic analyses are quickly evolving and the NGEN leadership seeks to maintain state-of-the- art services by continually broadening the repertoire of assays available to IDDRC investigators. For example the robust identification of human cell lines using short tandem repeat markers has been implemented to facilitate compliance with a new mandate from the NIH (Authentication of Key Biological and/or Chemical Resources), we are using the Fluidigm Biomark to offer single cell qRT-PCR for 96 genes in 96 cells, and we are one of the first cores to offer the Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin (ATAC-seq). Since the last cycle Einstein has become an institutional founding member of the New York Genome Center (NYGC), providing an even greater reach of genetic analyses. Einstein is leading the development of epigenomics services at the NYGC, with an early priority being the offering of whole genome bisulphite sequencing on the Illumina X Ten platform, allowing this valuable assay to be performed cost effectively at nucleotide resolution genome-wide. We anticipate that we will develop our relationship with the NYGC progressively over the next cycle, bringing more advanced technologies and cost savings to the IDDRC. We anticipate a continued increase in the use of the NGEN core as the assays offered become more commonly used, growth that we are well equipped to handle in our scalable core facility."
"9323652","PROJECT SUMMARY Despite decades of HIV-1 vaccine research, there are still no examples of vaccines or immunogens that consistently elicit potent broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) in animal models or in human subjects. This includes recent preclinical trials of soluble Env trimers (SOSIPs) and structure-based, scaffolded Env outer domain immunogens. To overcome this critical roadblock in vaccine design, we propose a novel strategy based on the scientific premise that since most examples of successful bNAb elicitation come from natural human infection by primary HIV-1 strains, the most likely means for eliciting bNAbs in RMs is by productive infection with SHIVs bearing primary HIV-1 Envs in their native configurations. Then, by characterizing the co- evolutionary pathways of bNAbs and the cognate SHIV Envs (?immunotypes?) that elicit them through repeated rounds of B cell receptor (BCR) engagement and affinity maturation, a ?molecular guide? for rational vaccine design can be developed and tested by both ?B lineage design? and ?reverse vaccinology? approaches. This application proposes an innovative research plan ? supported by recent discoveries in our laboratory regarding novel SHIV designs ? that advances these concepts. We propose to target the development of V1V2 epitope specific bNAbs because of unique features of their ontogeny that make them attractive for vaccine development, and because of the recent identification of Env immunotypes that bind germline and intermediate ancestor V1V2 lineage BCRs, leading to affinity maturation and neutralization breadth. Building on these promising findings, we hypothesize that co-infection of rhesus macaques with antigenically-diverse SHIVs whose Envs have been preselected to bind germline and intermediate ancestor V1V2 bNAb lineage specific BCRs, and co-immunization of RMs with homologous Env SOSIPs, will enhance BCR engagement and maturation and accelerate the development of HIV-1 V1V2 targeted bNAbs. To test this hypothesis, we propose to: (i) analyze NAb potency, breadth and epitope specificity, together with molecular patterns of Env- Ab coevolution, in 8 RMs infected by a mixture of six SHIVs bearing subtype A, B and C Envs preselected to bind germline and intermediate ancestor V1V2 bNAb lineage BCRs, compared with RMs infected by individual SHIVs bearing the same Envs; (ii) analyze NAb potency, breadth and epitope specificity, together with molecular patterns of Env-Ab coevolution, in 8 RMs infected by a mixture of six SHIVs bearing the Env from CAP256SU, which binds the germline V1V2 bNAb BCR, and its evolved variants that led to bNAb maturation in the human subject CAP256, compared with animals infected by SHIV CAP256SU only; (iii) corroborate the identification of Env immunotypes in Aims 1 and 2 responsible for bNAb induction by re-engineering selected Envs into SHIVs, followed by infection of 8 RMs and analysis of NAb potency, breadth and specificity; and (iv) construct novel Env SOSIPs comprised of immunotypes identified in Aims 1-3 and use them for vaccination in 12 RMs, followed by an analysis of vaccine elicited NAb potency, breadth and specificity."
"9346996","PROJECT SUMMARY: An Oral Ultra Long-Acting Ivermectin for Malaria Elimination Despite effective treatments, malaria remains a scourge of sub-Saharan Africa. Additional interventions beyond those currently available are needed to eliminate the disease. One strategy with increasing support is addition of ivermectin, a well-known and safe drug used for treating onchocerciasis and other diseases, to current mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns with artemisinin regimens. Ivermectin has a unique activity in interrupting malaria transmission in endemic areas by reducing the life expectancy of the vector anopheles mosquitos that bite subjects who have ivermectin in their blood. Modeling, as well as proof of concept field studies, have shown that long (10 plus day) courses of small doses of ivermectin, in combination with short courses of currently used artemisinin combination MDA, have the potential to reduce the efficiency of malaria transmission, reduce malaria cases, and potentially lead to disease elimination. Treating even 50% of the population in this way can reduce disease transmission to levels that can protect the whole population, including children under 5 most at risk. To be effective, repeat dosing every three days would currently be necessary, limiting feasibility. Development of an ultra long-acting oral ivermectin formulation that achieves single dose administration and prolonged low level blood exposure could dramatically change current treatment options, reduce malaria morbidity and potentiate malaria elimination efforts. No existing oral delivery system can prolong therapeutic blood levels for small molecules therapeutics beyond 12-24 hours. We have developed prototype oral capsules based on Lyndra's gastric residence technology that can achieve 7-14 days of sustained therapeutic ivermectin levels in a pig model and have shown similar efficacy with other drugs in multiple large animal models. The goal of this grant is to develop an optimal ivermectin dosage form that 1) achieves consistent and efficacious blood levels of ivermectin for 14 days from a single dose administration, 2) develop a reproducible and scalable low cost manufacturing capability, and 3) evaluate these dosage forms with respect to pharmacokinetics and gastric retention in beagle dogs. Formulations will be developed to pharmaceutical grade standards of in vitro release and stability under Tropical Zone 4b standards. Methods of production compatible with low cost of goods production and scale will be prototyped. Dosage forms will be evaluated in extensive preclinical pharmacology studies in beagles, including stress conditions, and a toxicology study will be performed. This grant will deliver a product ready for IND-enabling studies and create capability for GMP production of clinical specimens for a phase 1 human pharmacokinetic (PK) study of ultra long-acting Lyndra-Ivermectin. This Direct to Phase II grant builds on three years of work and ample preliminary data."
"9321600","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In sub-Saharan Africa, the scale-up of antiretroviral (ARV) prophylaxis for the prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission, as well as improved understanding of risk factors for transmission through breastfeeding, have dramatically reduced the number of infants becoming infected resulting in the number of HIV-exposed, uninfected (HIV-EU) children being born rising to dwarf even the staggering number of children infected with HIV. Under appreciated is a growing body of data that these HIV- EU are at risk for early life development abnormalities including growth faltering, higher morbidities, and increased risk for infant diarrhea during the first two years of life compared to children born to HIV-uninfected mothers (HIV-unexposed, HIV-UU). We hypothesize that the infant's altered gut microbiota: 1) is inherited from the mother; 2) persists over the critical early age of development; and 3) contributes to the reported growth abnormalities and adverse clinical outcomes for the infant. The investigative team, led by the University of Maryland School of Medicine's Institute of Human Virology and Institute for Genome Sciences proposes the Microbiome Affects Risk of Growth in HIV-exposed but Uninfected Infants in Nigeria (MARGIN) Study. MARGIN addresses scientific knowledge gaps in the critical window of time for growth and health of HIV-EU compared to HIV-UU through these innovative specific aims: (1) Characterize the relationship of infants' early gut microbiota to maternal pattern; (2) Characterize the functional differences in the infant gut microbiota between HIV-EU and HIV-UU infants; (3) Determine the associations between clinical outcomes and the structure and function of the infants' gut microbiota. This innovative strategy for understanding the role of the microbiome in growth and development not only has implications for addressing the significant public health challenge impacting 15% of all newborn babies in sub-Saharan Africa but also provides fundamental biological insight into the interface between host and microbiota and the role of the mother in the evolution of infant microbiota. From a translational perspective, this study lays the foundation for developing science-driven interventions such as probiotics to restore a favorable gut microbiota and its integrity, support growth, and mitigate persistent diarrhea and other recurrent infections among HIV-EU."
"9462985","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Suicidal behavior is a significant concern on college campuses, and suicide is the second leading cause of death in college student populations. Consistent with recommendations in the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention and spearheaded by organizations such as the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, many universities have initiated voluntary web-based screening to identify students at elevated risk for suicide and in need of mental health services. This is a promising direction; however, research is needed to determine the efficacy of such an approach and how to most effectively link students with positive screens to professional services. With NIMH funding for an R34 intervention development grant, we developed, pilot tested and iteratively refined a theoretically-driven intervention, Students' eBridge to Mental Health (eBridge), which identifies students at elevated suicide risk and facilitates their linkage to mental health (MH) services. eBridge incorporates motivational interviewing (MI) principles and draws from health behavior promotion models that emphasize autonomy and self-determination. Following a web-based screen using standardized instruments to identify students at elevated risk (positive screens on any two or more of: lifetime suicide attempt, current suicidal ideation, alcohol abuse, depression), eBridge offers students the options of receiving personalized feedback (provided online in a conversational MI-adherent format) and corresponding online with professionals trained in MI and knowledgeable about local resources. In our R34 pilot randomized trial, students in the control condition received personalized feedback only, which was provided automatically and in graphic format. At 2-month follow-up, students assigned to eBridge reported (a) significantly higher levels of readiness to seek MH services; (b) significantly lower levels of stigma related to MH services; and (c) a higher likelihood of linking to MH services. In this application, we propose to conduct a large-scale, well-powered randomized controlled intervention trial across multiple universities to address the following specific aims: (1) determine the impact of eBridge on linkage to MH services, MH outcomes (suicidal thoughts and behaviors, depression, alcohol/substance misuse), and academic outcomes (grade point average, retention) at 6-month follow-up; and (2) examine possible moderators (gender, baseline levels of functioning, baseline recognition of problem) and mediators (engagement in online counseling, linkage to MH services) of eBridge effectiveness. Secondary aims include determining the costs associated with, and cost effectiveness of, the intervention. If the intervention is shown to be effective in his large-scale trial, it could be disseminated broadly to address suicide risk and associated mental health conditions and adverse consequences among college adults nationwide."
"9296856","Natural Killer (NK) cells are a major lineage of human lymphocytes with vital functions in innate and adaptive immunity and adaptive immunity to hematologic cancers. NK cell functions are mediated by the diverse interactions of highly polymorphic HLA-A, -B, and -C molecules with equally polymorphic killer immunoglobulin- like receptors (KIR). They are complemented by the conserved interactions of HLA-E with CD94:NKG2 heterodimers. The genes encoding KIR receptors and HLA ligands segregate independently, thereby generating unique and diverse genotypes within families and populations. Phenotypically, this produces functionally distinct NK cell repertoires, a natural variation that has profound effects on the outcome of HCT. To date, there has never been an appropriate in vivo xenogeneic model for studying NK-cell development and education through HCT or for validating the adoptive transfer of human NK cells. Historically, there have been two major barriers to study human NK-cell engraftment and function: (1) human NK-cell reconstitution and survival is dependent upon common ?-chain cytokines IL-2, IL-7 and IL-15 that are not cross reactive between species; and (2) human NK-cell function is educated, regulated and maintained by inhibitory receptor engagement with MHC class I molecules that are also not cross-reactive between species. We have now overcome the cytokine and MHC class I barrier by utilizing a cutting-edge adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector-mediated gene delivery approach to transduce genes encoding HLA-A, -B, -C and ?E polypeptides, as well as certain human cytokines, to highly immunodeficient NSG mice that lack mouse-derived ?2- microglobulin, named NSG-B2M-/- mice. In Specific Aim (SA)1 we will establish human immune system (HIS) mice expressing select human cytokines and HLA-A*02 and/or HLA-E. The cytokines IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, IL-7, IL- 15 and GM-CSF will promote development of human NK cells along with human T cells, B cells, myeloid macrophages and DCs. We will apply a 42-plex mass cytometry antibody panel to closely map lymphocyte reconstitution following HCT at an unprecedented resolution. NK cell development, education and function will be studied longitudinally over a range of 20 weeks. In SA2 we will infect HIS mice with luciferase-labeled tumor target cells in order to evaluate the impact of NK cell education on anti-tumor activity and outcome of HCT. We will compare anti-tumor function of NK cells from HIS mice by mass cytometry as well as tumor burden by bioluminescence imaging. Our HIS mouse model will provide a definitive answer on whether HLA-E can directly educate CD94:NKG2A+ human NK cells and how this education impacts their capacity to respond to circulating tumors. In SA2, we will also measure the in vivo effects of CMV infection (and reactivation) on the education of adaptive NK cells and their enhanced anti-tumor response. With the ultimate goal of developing HIS mice expressing human cytokines along with complex HLA class I haplotypes, we will be able to effectively harness NK cell effector for treatment of hematologic cancers."
"9364772","The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening condition of airspace inflammation and edema causing severely low blood oxygen levels that may complicate up to 24% of ICU admissions for mechanical ventilation. Mortality remains above 35% and no prevention or pharmacotherapy options exist. We previously identified and replicated a functional genetic variant in the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL1RA) gene, encoding the protein IL1RA, that was strongly associated with lower ARDS risk and higher evoked plasma IL1RA levels. We also demonstrated a causal role for plasma interleukin-1 beta (IL1?), the molecule inhibited by IL1RA, in mortality from septic shock. Finally, in a subgroup of subjects randomized to receive recombinant human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (rhIL1RA) or placebo for sepsis, we demonstrated significant heterogeneity in the mortality treatment effect of rhIL1RA that was predictable by plasma IL1RA concentration. Taken together, our data indicated that some patients may be genetically protected from ARDS via more efficient IL1RA production, suggesting that the drug rhIL1RA may be an effective prevention or treatment strategy. However, because we proved that the effect of rhIL1RA during sepsis is not uniform, the current application will obtain critical information about the causal contribution of plasma IL1RA and IL1??to ARDS risk and death from ARDS, will develop predictive models for ARDS risk in an effort to identify a target population for rhIL1RA intervention, and will determine the direct effects of rhIL1RA treatment on ex vivo perfused human lungs. Our long term objective is to evaluate rhIL1RA as a precision ARDS prevention and/or treatment strategy. Aim 1 will focus on ARDS risk, using a genetic instrumental variable technique to infer the causal effect of plasma IL1RA and IL1??for ARDS risk, and developing and validating an ARDS predictive model that considers clinical factors and plasma IL-1 markers in 2 large sepsis cohorts. Aim 2 will focus on ARDS and sepsis mortality. We will use multiple genotypes as an instrumental variable to test the contribution of early or delayed plasma IL-1 markers for death from ARDS, and will develop and validate predictive models for ARDS mortality, using clinical data and plasma IL-1 markers measured in 2 large sepsis cohorts. In Aim 3, we will use a novel platform known as ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP), whereby lungs declined for transplantation are ventilated and perfused in a highly controlled environment, to test whether rhIL1RA given as treatment or prevention to injured human lungs will improve oxygenation, lung compliance, and inflammation. The multidisciplinary team of investigators and consultants to enact these aims include an EVLP expert, 2 epidemiologists with expertise in lung injury prediction and molecular subphenotyping, a statistical geneticist who is expert in instrumental variable analysis, and the PI, a translational scientist who first identified a link between IL1RN variation, plasma protein expression, and ARDS risk."
"9390417","PROJECT SUMMARY Cognitive deficits remain a major untreated problem in schizophrenia. The proposed research in this Competitive Revision application aims to examine some of the neurobiological processes by which cognitive training can rectify the pervasive cognitive deficits that characterize schizophrenia during the early course of illness. Cognitive training (CT) programs hold considerable promise for patients with schizophrenia, and recent research with animals and healthy humans demonstrates that combining CT with aerobic exercise (CT+E) can promote neuroplasticity and markedly enhance the effects of CT on cognition. However, the neurobiological mechanisms by which CT and CT+E bring about improvements in cognition among individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia remain poorly understood. We exploit recent advances in understanding auditory inhibitory processing dysfunction in schizophrenia to evaluate how CT might generate improvements in clinical ratings of attention and in performance measures of attention, working memory, and speed of processing. Specifically, we address the possibility that enhancement of early perceptual processing during CT serves to improve clinical and cognitive functioning in schizophrenia by fostering normalization of brain activation and connectivity implicated in auditory inhibitory processing. Other goals of the study include evaluating whether auditory inhibitory processing at baseline assessment predicts improvements in attentional functioning after CT and determining whether CT+E yields stronger effects than CT alone when impairments in auditory inhibitory processing are relatively severe at baseline. Neural mechanisms will be examined by obtaining electrophysiological (ERP and EEG) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures before and after first- episode schizophrenia patients receive either CT or CT+E through random assignment as part of the clinical trial funded by the parent grant (1 R01 MH110544-01). Clarification of the dynamic interactions between brain regions and their association with such complex behaviors as attention and working memory is an essential step towards developing more effective interventions to facilitate patients' functional outcomes."
"9330167","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The primary objective of the Live Cell Imaging Core (LCIC) is to facilitate research by COBRE Lung Biology Center (LBC) investigators on chronic bacterial infections of the lungs and to develop new approaches to treat these diseases. The infrastructure and scientific expertise of the LCIC supports live-cell imaging, including visualization of intracellular protein localization and host-microbe interaction studies. The specific aims of the LCIC are to: (1) Provide expertise and technical support for studies imaging the co-culture biofilm model of host-pathogen interactions developed at Dartmouth, (2) Develop and apply novel and established imaging approaches to understand the impact of infections on protein trafficking, localization, and assembly in airway epithelial cells and immune cells, and (3) Continue a trajectory to financial sustainability by the end of COBRE III, enabling the Core to continue providing imaging services and expertise to LBC investigators, as well as to Dartmouth and IDeA partners. Since its formation in 2010, the LCIC has made significant contributions to 13 research projects, including those conducted by junior faculty project leaders, faculty in the LBC funded by pilot projects, and LBC projects conducted in collaboration with 7 industrial partners. LBC faculty have indicated in the 2012 yearly review that their current usage of the LCIC will continue, and overall usage is likely to increase due to faculty hiring and new pilot projects: 10 out of 15 responses to our preliminary RFA will utilize the LCIC. Bruce A. Stanton, Ph.D., the Andrew C Vail Professor of Microbiology and Immunology, will direct the Core. He has over 34 years of experience in biological imaging. The core manager, Qianru Yu, Ph.D. is also an expert in biological imaging and will continue to facilitate use of the Core Olympus and Nikon LSC live cell imaging workstations by LBC investigators. In COBRE II we have developed a highly successful plan of LCIC evaluation, quality control, resource evaluation, investigator education, training and outreach. As a result, we are in an exceptionally strong position to build on our track record of supporting research on host-pathogen interactions, the respiratory microbiome in CF, drug discovery and therapeutic development for respiratory infectious diseases in COBRE III and beyond."
"9397774","Project Summary/Abstract The proposed project addresses the vital health problem of improving reading outcomes for a vulnerable population: students with or at-risk for reading disabilities. Numerous studies have documented the relationship between literacy levels and health outcomes (Berkman et al., 2004). As a result, ways in which low reading achievement can be prevented or ameliorated are highly relevant to the public health sector. The purpose of the proposed studies is to investigate the effects of a mindset intervention, embedded and not embedded in an intensive reading intervention, on the reading outcomes of fourth grade students with or at-risk for reading disabilities. In Study 1, the effects of adding mindset training to an intensive reading intervention will be systematically examined relative to intensive reading intervention alone and business as usual. In Study 2, the effects of embedding mindset training in an intensive reading intervention will be examined. Specifically, the proposed project seeks to (a) determine the effects of mindset intervention with intensive reading intervention relative to reading intervention alone and business as usual comparison on the reading outcomes of fourth grade students with or at-risk for reading disabilities, (b) determine the effects of embedding mindset intervention in an intensive reading intervention, and (c) link student characteristics to response to intervention. In Study 1, students will be randomly assigned to condition with students in the reading intervention plus mindset condition receiving the mindset intervention along with their reading intervention. Students assigned to the reading intervention will receive the same reading intervention but without the mindset intervention. Students in the business as usual condition will continue to receive their typical school services which will be carefully documented. In Study 2, we will use the results from Study 1 to further examine the effects of an intensive reading intervention with mindset embedded in the content with a new cohort of fourth grade students with or at-risk for reading disabilities. In both studies, we will examine the effects of intervention on students? word reading, reading fluency, reading comprehension, and general academic achievement. In addition, we will link students? initial reading achievement, mindset, vocabulary, behavior/attention, and demographics to student response to intervention. The effects of the intervention will be analyzed using a series of hierarchical linear models to account for the data?s multilevel structure."
"9319803","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Visual working memory (WM) is a central cognitive system for maintaining active representations about objects in the environment so that they may be manipulated or acted upon. Individual differences in WM ability in healthy populations appear to reflect a core cognitive ability because they strongly predict an individual's fluid intelligenc as well as several aspects of scholastic achievement. Furthermore, WM deficits are a signature of many prevalent mental health disorders. Thus, a detailed understanding of this system is essential if we are to understand and treat psychopathologies that involve impaired cognition such as attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or schizophrenia. In addition, because of the tight link between online visual memory and basic processes for visual perception, our work will help to integrate basic knowledge about visual sensory processing (e.g., population coding of simple visual features) and online memory. One of the most fundamental attributes of WM is that it is greatly limited in capacity: capable of storing information about just a few objects at  time, each with a limited level of precision. A key recent discovery is that these number and precision limits are distinct facets of WM capacity. However, the neural mechanisms that underlie these two factors that determine capacity are not currently understood. Here, we are developing neural oscillatory and hemodynamic measures that enable tracking of both between- and within-subject variations in these abilities. Specifically, our preliminary data show that the number of items held in WM is indexed on a trial-by-trial basis by desynchronization in alpha power (8-12hz) and WM precision is indexed by the dispersion of sensory population codes (quantified via novel multivariate analyses of fMRI and EEG data). The proposed research will employ psychophysics, fMRI, and EEG to measure the neural signals that track number and precision in WM. These efforts will provide new insights into the functional subdivisions of visual WM, and build clear bridges between well characterized behavioral measures of online memory ability and measures of oscillatory activity in humans. Finally, we will also examine the interactions between visual WM and visual long term memory (LTM) to determine how the contents of WM determine that which is encoded into LTM. These studies will help to characterize the role of visual WM in associative learning and clarify the roles of each system in the guidance of complex behaviors. By more precisely understanding how healthy individuals differ in WM ability and visual sensory function, we hope to develop methods and procedures that can be used to more accurately detect and characterize disease states in populations with mental health disorders, and to diagnose and quantify disorders in visually-guided behavior."
"9494879","Segmental bone defects frequently occur as a result of trauma, infection and tumor resection in orthopaedic and craniofacial clinical practice. Bone graft transplantation has been used as the primary treatment regimen for reconstruction of large segmental bone defects. Each year over 600,000 bone grafting procedures are performed in the United States, and more than 2.2 million are performed worldwide. Current choices for bone grafting materials include autograft, allograft, and synthetic materials. While an autograft is considered as the ?gold standard?, the use of autograft is extremely limited due to the associated donor site morbidity and the restricted availability for repair of large bone defects. Allograft remains a top choice for repair of large defects that require immediate support. However, due to the lack of viable angiogenic and osteogenic cells, healing and incorporation of bone allograft are extremely slow and limited. The limited bone forming, revascularizing and remodeling properties of structural allograft are directly associated with a 25% to 35% failure rate within 2 years and a 60% failure rate in 10 years after implantation as a result of non-union, infection and propagation of microcracks of the devitalized bone. To overcome the limitation associated with structural allograft, we proposed a tissue engineering strategy to revitalize allograft by creating a functional periosteum to enhance allograft incorporation and remodeling. With the development of a versatile electrospinning technique and a novel near-field electrostatic printing (NFEP) method, our current proposal seeks to combine several scientific and technical advances into the creation of a micro/nanofibers-based, multi-modular, prevascularized bone tissue graft, with growth factor releasing property, simulating the highly organized and functional periosteum for reconstruction of large bone defects. Incorporation of key molecular signals and relevant cellular sources that promote both osteogenesis and angiogenesis will be addressed. The completion of the project could 1) establish a novel methodology to control the spatiotemporal assembly of osteogenic and angiogenic/vasculogenic cells into a multi-functional 3-dimensional cellular construct; 2) offer mechanistic information on anastomosis and integration of engineered vascular networks with host circulation; and 3) provide the basis and means for understanding of cell-matrix interactions and for engineering of microenvironments to direct progenitor cell differentiation for bone defect repair and reconstruction. The success of our current project will also lay foundation for engineering of more sophisticated blood vessels with hierarchical patterns, which could achieve a wide impact on various tissue reconstructions. Clinically, the success of the project could further offer rationales and strategies to effectively deliver osteogenic and angiogenic/vasculogenic cell populations for enhanced repair and reconstruction of both craniofacial and long bone defects."
"9209613","Abstract: Gliomas are the most commonly diagnosed primary brain tumors, accounting for approximately 45-50% of all primary brain tumors. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive of the primary brain cancers and despite advancements in surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, remains incurable. Further, human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) has been implicated in the development and progression of human glioblastomas through unknown mechanisms. The presence and role of hCMV infection in glioblastomas and GBM has remained a controversial topic over the last decade. Nonetheless, several groups have demonstrated the presence of CMV nucleic acids and proteins in primary and recurrent GBM specimens using immunohistochemistry (IHC), RNA and DNA in situ hybridization (ISH), qualitative and quantitative real-time PCR coupled with viral DNA sequencing, and western blot (WB) analysis. Subsequent research, including our preliminary studies, has also demonstrated that several hCMV gene products that have oncomodulatory properties are expressed in GBM and may be impacting tumor pathogenesis in vivo by modulating GBM proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, invasion and immune evasion. Because HCMV is a ubiquitous human virus that infects 50-90% of adults in the US, investigation of its potential oncomodulatory role in glioblastomas, particularly the aggressive GBM, is highly relevant. We hypothesize that persistent HCMV infections lead to a dysregulation of the cellular epigenetic environment that results in the overexpression of EZH2 and activation of the STAT3 pathway to enhance tumor pathogenesis in glioblastoma. To test this hypothesis, we will: 1) Determine whether HCMV persistence enhances tumor pathogenesis in glioblastoma cells through the dysregulation of epigenetic pathways involved in cell cycle control and differentiation. 2) Establish the role of HCMV persistence in tumor progression and glioblastoma drug resistance in intracranial xenografts. 3) Determine whether overexpression of EZH2 correlates with incidence of HCMV infection in glioblastoma biopsies.  The long-term goal is to identify novel pathways regulated through HCMV persistent infection that could lead to glioblastoma tumor progression and CNS invasion. The results of this research are expected to provide the framework for future studies testing therapeutic interventions, which maintain the normal epigenetic state of a cell and decrease the risk of CMV-associated tumor progression."

McCarter Jr., ScD Director of the IDDRC Biostatistics and Informatics Component Head: Research Section of Study Design and Biostatistical Consulting Children?s National Health System Catherine Stoodley, D.Phil. Assistant Professor Psychology and Neuroscience Department American University Abstract Premature birth is a major public health problem, associated with a personal, familial, and societal burden of enormous proportions. The potentially lifelong cognitive, learning and affective-behavioral consequences have become the major determinant of life quality in prematurity survivors, with up to 50% of very premature infants experiencing dysfunction in these domains by school age. Impaired cerebellar development has been recently implicated in this dysfunction. We have described a clinically important, previously under-recognized form of prematurity-related cerebellar parenchymal injury in up to 20% in extremely preterm infants. Recently, our observations have extended beyond the role of parenchymal cerebellar injury to a broader and more prevalent spectrum of cerebellar developmental impairments. We have shown that cerebellar development is (i) markedly accelerated during the third trimester, but (ii) significantly impeded after premature birth, even in the absence of direct cerebellar injury. We refer to this impaired growth as cerebellar developmental impairment (CDI). Complementing this intriguing set of structural observations are our findings of a distinctive long-term neuropsychological profile of cognitive, language, affective and social deficiency, which we have termed the developmental cerebellar cognitive affective disorder. The onset and underlying mechanisms and consequences of prematurity-related CDI remain poorly understood, which in turn have complicated the search for potential therapeutic interventions. We propose to utilize serial, advanced MRI techniques to elucidate the timing, evolution, mechanisms and risk factors of CDI in preterm infants born ?30 weeks gestational age. Our overarching goal is to identify early MR imaging biomarkers of prematurity-related CDI and the associated clinical factors that lead to specific development disabilities. We plan to leverage our large fetal normative database to compare in-utero fetal and ex-utero preterm cerebellar growth trajectories. These findings will inform specific targets, interventions and timing of future neuroprotective strategies, advance clinical practices, and improve neurodevelopmental outcomes."
"9543696","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past 30 years, dramatic advances in the understanding of HIV infection and its therapy have transformed HIV into a highly treatable, chronic disease. With this evolution, critical questions have arisen about how basic research and clinical trials relate to clinical epidemiology and outcomes research, both in the U.S. and internationally. The goal of the Program for AIDS Clinical Research Training (PACRT), which has successfully trained leading HIV clinical investigators for the past 20 years, is to provide training in quantitative research methodologies with a focus on HIV clinical research to predoctoral PhD students and physicians at formative stages in their careers. This training has prepared both groups: to conduct clinical research of the highest quality and of direct relevance to the prevention and treatment of HIV infection. They will make important contributions to the scientific literature and successfully develop as independent investigators. In the next grant cycle, the PACRT candidates will receive two years of research training under the close supervision and mentorship of one or more of the 14 experienced program faculty members. Trainees will receive didactic training at Harvard School of Public Health or other Harvard University sites. Primary performance sites for the five post-doctoral fellows will be the Massachusetts General Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Children's Hospital Boston and Harvard Medical School. The primary site for the two predoctoral fellows will be the Harvard School of Public Health. This program has three specific aims for its trainees: 1) To acquire a sufficient body of knowledge of quantitative methods to conduct independent research in:  clinical epidemiology, clinical trials, cost-effectiveness analysis, outcomes research, and/or implementation science. 2) To foster the creation of important scientific contributions with the close and longitudinal mentorship of program faculty. 3) To develop a primary research focus and a broad understanding of the various aspects of HIV disease for novel interdisciplinary research. Relevance: PACRT has a clearly defined and unique direction among HIV T32 programs, with its focus on clinical outcomes research, and how that research interfaces with translational research, clinical trials, and health policy. This program will play a crucial role in training the next generation of highly successful investigators to address the complex issues arising today in HIV clinical research."
"9412008","PROJECT SUMMARY New approaches for curative treatments could substantially reduce the numbers of individuals living with HIV- 1, thus diminishing the need for life-long adherence to ART. However, solutions must include clearing infection and preventing latent reservoirs. While ART is the standard of care for HIV+ individuals, the field has not yet addressed an alternative to ART therapy that could halt infection and halt virus expansion. A proven nonhuman primate (NHP) model for infection that examines new therapeutic regimens that can be instituted very soon after virus exposure, or in cases of viral control under ART, is needed to address whether it is possible to eradicate HIV. With the discoveries of extremely potent and broad antibodies that target multiple determinants on the HIV-1 Envelope, a cure strategy is now recognized as an attainable goal. The overall goal of this project is to design Fc function-enhanced anti-HIV-1 human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and test them for virus eradication in rhesus macaques in a Clade C, Tier 2, SHIV post-exposure protection model. Anti-viral functions mediated by the Fc part of the molecule are crucial to antibody protection against HIV, but clearing HIV-1 infection using antibodies is a new paradigm for antibodies. Specific combinations of neutralizing mAbs have been predicted to have the potential for neutralization coverage against large cross-clade panels of HIV-1 isolates; V2-directed mAbs were identified as an immune correlate of RV144 in reducing infection risk. Our working hypothesis is that combinations of mAbs, if enhanced for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), phagocytosis (ADCP), and complement activation, and engineered and tested in vivo for increased half-life, would be extremely effective in ablating early acute infection and limiting or eliminating seeding of viral reservoirs. The project proposal outlines a research plan to engineer, develop and characterize in vitro a panel of human monoclonal anti-HIV mAbs with enhanced effector function designed to increase the effectiveness of killing HIV-1 infected cells. Fc regions of mAbs of known potency and breadth will be modified by site directed mutagenesis for increased effector functions and for optimal affinity to human and macaque Fc?Rs. Once modified, functional assays will be used to evaluate the improvements in ADCC, ADCP and complement activation. Increased half-life evaluations will be performed in NHP. Combinations of modified mAbs will be tested in vitro to identify the most optimal groupings for additive effect of neutralization and effector functions. These mAbs will be chosen for large-scale production in amounts and purity needed for macaque experiments. An iterative progression of post-infection studies will be conducted in rhesus macaques, testing several combinations and examining doses and varying intervals before treatment. The practical goal is to formulate the most optimal combinations of mAbs that provide the highest degree of viral and reservoir clearance."
"9429418","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of death in patients with refractory epilepsy, estimated to account for up to 50% of all deaths in this population and up to 17% of deaths in all patients with epilepsy. There is a surprisingly common lack of awareness among patients and physicians of this increased risk of sudden death. In a recent survey, only 56% of Canadian pediatricians who treat patients with epilepsy knew their patients were at increased risk for sudden death and only 33% of these physicians knew the term SUDEP. There is controversy regarding whether cardiac failure or respiratory arrest is more important as the primary cause of death, but cardiac and respiratory data is rarely collected simultaneously from human cases of SUDEP or from mouse models. For example, in the more than 20 documented cases of SUDEP that occurred while the patient was undergoing EMU monitoring, none of these patients had measurements of ventilation or even blood oxygenation. Effective preventive strategies in high-risk epileptic patients will rely on defining the mechanisms that lead from seizures to death. Our preliminary data suggest that respiratory depression is the primary cause of death in some cases of SUDEP and that patients with Dravet syndrome have previously uncharacterized breathing abnormalities in the peri-ictal period. Furthermore, our data has indicated there is an anatomical pathway that inhibits ventilation, which extends from the amygdala and anterior temporal lobe to medullary nuclei that control breathing. However, it is unclear how this circuit is connected and the identities of the neurons involved. In Aim 1, we will characterize peri-ictal cardiorespiratory control in human patients with Dravet syndrome as well as mouse models of this pathology. In Aim 2, we will define the anatomical pathway from the amygdala to the brainstem that inhibits the cardiovascular and respiratory control networks during seizures. Finally, in Aim 3 we will determine the identity of brainstem neurons that receive inputs from the amygdala and inhibit breathing and consciousness during seizures. This work will identify an anatomical pathway by which cortical seizures can invade the midbrain and brainstem and cause depressed cardiorespiratory function and arousal. Our findings have the potential to characterize key components of this circuit and may identify biomarkers that can be used to develop effective screening strategies. Better understanding mechanisms that underlie SUDEP will allow future development of preventative treatments that may decrease SUDEP risk."
"9324131","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes the creation of a Skin Disease Resource-Based Core center at Columbia University (epiCURE). The epiCURE is designed to address critical roadblocks on the Continuum of Translational research as defined by the Institute of Medicine. The continuum defines three critical translational phases in biomedical research: basic science into pre-clinical efficacy into clinical effectiveness. The Cores of the epiCURE center have been strategically configured to address these critical phases in skin disease research, and provide a unique set of services and resources to facilitate advancement of the Research Community along the translational continuum pipeline that is driven by a Precision Medicine-based algorithm and is responsive to the NIAMS mission. The epiCURE Center, and the Institutional Commitment that accompanies it, can accomplish this goal by providing a uniquely effective service-based vehicle for investigator interactions that further education, training and research in cutaneous biology and skin disease. The configuration of the epiCURE represents a natural, logical progression built on the previous successes of our existing SDRC over the past 18 years, in bridging basic discoveries and translational research, and catalyzing their entry into the clinic. We have given very careful consideration to selecting the service and resource components of the epiCURE so that they bolster the existing research excellence at Columbia University and the broader Research Community, which is comprised of 37 investigators at Columbia University as well as 37 investigators at other 18 institutions in the New York metropolitan area and across the country. In addition to an Administrative Core and innovative Enrichment Program, the epiCURE is structured around three Service Cores that span a continuum of basic, pre-clinical and translational research: 1) Skin Stem Cell Imaging and Manipulation (SCIM); 2) Skin Immunity, Integrity and Disease Models (SIND); and 3) Translational and Precision Medicine Resources (TRAP). The overall goal of the epiCURE center is to break down barriers to translational research, and accelerate the progress of investigation in skin disease research to rapidly advance from basepairs to bedside."
"9297248","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Metastasis remains responsible for over 90% of cancer-related deaths, and can be described as a series of physical events including tumor cell detachment from the primary site, invasion into the circulation, translocation through the blood to microvessels in distant organs, and transmigration through endothelium to form secondary tumors. One of the most common sites for metastasis is bone, which confers increased morbidity, a 5-year survival rate of ~25%, and median survival of ~40 months. Upon colonization in bone, tumor cells become highly resistant to chemotherapy, and effective treatments remain elusive. Bone marrow endothelial cells (BMECs) constitutively express the adhesion receptor E-selectin (ES) and the chemoattractant stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), which bind to ES ligands (ESLs) and CXCR4 on tumor cells, respectively. Such interactions enable the adhesion and homing of tumor cells to BMECs necessary for tumor formation in bone. Down regulation or inhibition of ES and SDF-1 on BMECs provides a potential solution to disrupt bone metastasis formation. However, direct and specific inhibition of constitutive ES and SDF-1 on BMECs by small-molecules has been elusive, and blocking antibodies induce endothelial cell (EC) activation, which can promote further metastasis. Thus, ES and SDF-1 are promising candidates for combination RNA interference (RNAi) therapy, which inhibits traditionally undruggable targets by reducing mRNA expression. The challenge of utilizing siRNA is the need for safe, effective delivery methods, as unmodified siRNA is unstable in the bloodstream, immunogenic, and does not readily cross cell membranes. In the proposed research, we will develop and implement a bone marrow (BM) endothelium-targeted polymeric nanoparticle (NP) siRNA delivery platform to disrupt bone metastasis formation in vivo. Proven endothelium-specific siRNA delivery technology developed by our lab, termed 7C1, will now be functionalized with the targeting moiety Sialyl Lewis-X (SLeX) to enable targeted siRNA delivery and silencing of a target gene in BMECs in vivo, without reducing gene expression in other endothelium (Aim 1). We will conduct a screen to determine the most potent ES and SDF-1 siRNA candidates to encapsulate in targeted 7C1 (t-7C1), verify that t-7C1 can down regulate ES and SDF-1, and determine its efficacy in reducing tumor cell adhesion and transendothelial migration in vitro (Aim II). We will then determine the optimal siRNA dosage to down regulate ES and SDF-1 on BMECs in vivo, test the central hypothesis that down regulation of ES and SDF-1 will disrupt tumor cell adhesion and tumor formation in a mouse model of bone metastasis, and determine potential side effects of our approach on normal stem cell and leukocyte homing to BM (Aim III). The proposed project targets metastasis by disrupting the physical translocation of tumor cells to bone, and presents broadly enabling siRNA delivery technologies to silence multiple genes in BMECs that contribute to a range of diseases."
"9382294","Abstract Endosomes, the membrane compartments inside living cells, are increasingly recognized as discrete ?hubs? that regulate the network of cell signaling circuits in space and time. Physical phenomena like the clustering of proteins on endosome membranes and the active transport of endosomes are hypothesized to play a key role in these regulatory mechanisms. Unfortunately however, the direct evidence needed to support this level of mechanistic understanding of endosome signaling is lacking. Over the last four years, the research program of my lab has focused on exploring the wealth of physical phenomena involved in the endocytic process. We have uncovered new physical mechanisms of endocytosis in immune cells, but the questions we pose are of general relevance to many kinds of cells. We aim to test the general hypothesis that endosomes are a specialized platform for the spatiotemporal regulation of cellular signal transduction. This proposal highlights two of our developing project areas that are designed to test this hypothesis by identifying the biophysical mechanisms of endosome signaling regulation. Both are enabled by our established biophysical tools that allow us to manipulate and analyze the signaling activities and dynamics of endosomes in living cells. One research direction focuses on the mechanisms of signaling crosstalk on endosome membranes. Our ultimate goal for this research direction is to identify mechanisms by which physical interactions between endosomal receptors lead to their signaling crosstalk. By developing a novel approach that physically manipulates interactions between receptors on endosome membranes, we will establish the quantitative relationship between receptor clusters on endosomes, their signaling crosstalk, and the end-point cell response. The other research project addresses the functional roles of endosome trafficking in signaling. Our ultimate goal for this second research direction is to determine mechanisms under which the transport and subcellular location of endosomes regulate their signaling functions. By developing a particle reporter system that will allow us to magnetically control trafficking of single endosomes and simultaneously detect their signaling activities, we will reveal direct connection between the dynamical, mechanical and biochemical activities of individual endosomes. The proposed research directions are enabled by the novel integration of nanomaterial engineering, quantitative physical measurements, and advanced optical techniques, with live cell experiments. In the long term, we will expand our research scope from endosome signaling in immune cells to that in other cell types. Our ongoing and future research directions share the overarching goal of establishing a quantitative understanding of endosome signaling in living cells."
"9356350","Project Summary/Abstract While Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, the contribution of vascular factors to cognitive impairment and dementia is becoming increasingly recognized. Vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) is most commonly caused by cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). To date, cerebral small vessels including arterioles, capillaries and venules are inaccessible to existing imaging technologies. Characteristic parenchymal lesions on MRI, such as lacunar infarcts, white matter lesions, and microbleeds, have been adopted as markers of SVD. However, these parenchymal lesions are the consequences of SVD rather than the surrogate markers of microvascular changes, and are unsuitable for early interventions to change the course of VCID. During the past few years, our group has spearheaded the development of a suite of cutting edge MRI technologies for in vivo and noninvasive assessment of microvascular structure and function, including (1) high-resolution black blood MRI for direct imaging of perforating arteries; (2) arterial spin labeling (ASL) techniques for mapping microvascular perfusion, arterial stiffness or vascular compliance (VC) of small arteries/arterioles, and water exchange rate across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Furthermore, we recently developed quantitative metrics for retinal capillary density and morphology using an FDA approved optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) platform. This method allows clinically feasible, in vivo and completely noninvasive imaging of retinal arterioles and capillaries with a spatial resolution of ~10 microns. Capitalizing on our extensive technical expertise and longstanding track record of clinical studies on VCID, we propose this UH2/UH3 project to further develop and evaluate a suite of MRI and OCTA markers for assessing the structure and function of cerebral and retinal microvasculature, in a cohort of Latino subjects enrolled in the Los Angeles Latino Eye Study (LALES) and in the study of autosomal dominant AD in persons of Mexican origin (Estudio de Enfermedad de Alzheimer en Jalisciences, or EEAJ). During the UH2 phase, we will further develop and evaluate the proposed MRI and OCTA imaging markers of SVD, establish their test-retest repeatability and clinical utility. We will work with the other participating sites and with the Coordinating Center to establish collaborative parameters and agreements of the consortium. During the UH3 phase, we will contribute to and execute cross-site research studies as designed by the consortium. We will perform unified and comprehensive clinical, cognitive, imaging, genetic and biochemical assessments on the cohort of LALES and EEAJ participants locally and perform data analyses as required by the consortium. At the closing of this project, we expect to develop the suite of microvascular imaging markers to readiness to enter into large-scale multi-site clinical validation studies toward FDA qualification for phase II and phase III clinical trials on small vessel disease to prevent and treat VCID."
"9328000","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Overall Over 90% of cancer related mortality is linked to invasive and metastatic spread of cancer cells from the primary tumor. This spread can be catastrophically fast in the cases of particularly aggressive, high grade melanomas and gliomas (i.e., glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)), leading to uniformly poor prognosis and short life expectancy in these cancers. In spite of the crucial importance of invasive cancer phenotype, we still have only fragmentary knowledge and understanding of the mechanisms leading to transition from proliferative to aggressive, migratory behavior of cancer cells (referred here as the P-A phenotypic switch). Increasing evidence suggests that this switch is a reflection of inherent capacity of cancer cells to adopt both proliferative and migrator phenotypes, with the probability and rate of switching between these two phenotypes controlled by the cell genome, environmental conditions and cell-cell interactions. To address the problem of regulation of invasive cancer spread and, more specifically the P-A phenotypic switch, we propose to establish the Yale Cancer Systems Biology Center (Y-CSBC). The Center will based on the existing organization and infrastructure of the recently founded Yale Systems Biology Institute (YSBI) on the Yale West Campus, leveraging the extensive existing shared resources and juxtaposition of the labs within the same recently renovated, state of the art research space. The Center will bring together researchers from 7 Yale departments based at Yale schools of Arts and Science, Engineering and Applied Science and Medicine and Emory University, in close collaboration with Yale Cancer Institute (physically adjacent to YSBI), Yale Cancer Center, Yale skin cancer SPORE, and Yale Neurosurgery department. The work at the proposed Center will be initially based on the Proposed tightly knit two Research Projects and two support shared resource Cores, initially focused on the analysis of glioblastoma and melanoma cells, and normal cells of various species modeling invasive growth behavior and phenotypic switching. With time, the emphasis on these two cancers may broaden with new members expanding the scope and the aims. The proposed research already reflects the diversity and innovative nature of the work pursued by the participating labs within YSBI and collaborative labs, with the combination of techniques and approaches as diverse as synthetic biology, nano-scale bioengineering, evolutionary biology, high throughput genomics, mathematical modeling, novel animal models, all combined into a integrated research program. The work will be supported by the Administrative Core and the results disseminated through various mechanisms mediated by the Outreach and Education Core. The orthogonal and unconventional approaches proposed in the application and characteristic of the highly collaborative use of cutting edge, innovative approaches, many of which are being pioneered here, will provide an opportunity to advance our understanding of the molecular networks controlling invasive, aggressive cancer spread and lead to new approaches to controlling and treating highly invasive and metastatic malignancies."
"9353653","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Metastatic dissemination and outgrowth of cancers is responsible for almost 90% of cancer-related deaths. The current ability to treat metastatic lesions using standard therapy is extremely limited, as they are often inoperable and resistant to chemotherapies. Understanding of the drivers of this process and identifying novel ways to target metastatic disease is therefore of critical importance. Several lines of evidence in melanoma and lung cancer models suggest that LKB1-deficiency is a strong promoter of metastasis, but the mechanisms by which LKB1 loss promotes lung tumor metastasis have not been well defined. Our preliminary data suggest that Wnt5a is upregulated in LKB1-deficient contexts and given its role in invasion and metastasis in other cancers, as well as elevated expression in metastatic human lung cancer, it is possible that Wnt5a is a downstream mediator of LKB1 dependent metastasis and represents a promising therapeutic target for this disease. In this proposal, the role of Wnt5a in LKB1-deficient lung cancer metastasis will be addressed both in vitro and in vivo as well as their therapeutic benefits of targeting Wnt5a for treatment of NSCLC. First, both genetic deletion and viral-mediated overexpression will be used to evaluate the contribution of Wnt5a to invasion and metastatic phenotypes in vitro, as well as address the LKB1-dependency on Wnt5a to promote metastasis. The consequences of Wnt5a modulation on the ability of NSCLC cells to metastasize in vivo will be addressed using orthotopic allograft transplants and endogenous deletion in genetically engineered murine models of NSCLC using CRISPR technology. Additional studies are designed to test the therapeutic efficacy of Wnt5a antagonists to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Lastly, the experiments proposed in this fellowship will elucidate the signaling pathways activated downstream of Wnt5a that are critical for metastasis, both through evaluation of known Wnt5a signaling components and RNA sequencing to identify novel downstream regulators of metastasis. Together, these studies will define the role of Wnt5a in LKB1-deficient metastasis and address the therapeutic benefit of targeting Wnt5a signaling in NSCLC metastasis, with the potential for enhanced efficacy in patients with tumors harboring LKB1 mutations."
"9318313","Developmental Neuroimaging Core Project Summary The goals of the Developmental Neuroimaging Core (DNC) are: to provide a flexible concierge approach to facilitating investigation, from consultation and assistance with study design, to full acquisition and interpretation of human imaging data, to training investigative teams to progressive levels of mastery that will allow them to continue and extend their own IDD research agendas. The DNC will provide state-of-the art neuroimaging services to maximize the quality and impact of IDD research by Center investigators, to optimize the application of imaging as a translational tool for innovation in prediction and intervention in developmental disabilities, and to provide a range of consultative and analytic services that will help new and early stage investigators to incorporate imaging research into their research efforts. The DNC is designed to provide capacity to ascertain neural signatures of developmental disability as a critical facet of the comprehensive characterization of patients and pathogenic mechanisms. Moreover, as rapid advances in imaging technology occur, the DNC will continue to make the latest innovations in neuroimaging accessible to the large and growing investigator community at WUSTL studying IDD. This Core advances IDD research through focused expertise in neuroimaging technology: mock scanning; specialized approaches to data acquisition in un- sedated infants and children with IDD; data analyses predicated upon established brain-behavior relationships in developing children; complete data analyses for early through to experienced investigators; an informatics platform with serial measurement and mapping of developmental trajectories. The Specific Aims are: 1) To provide high-quality comprehensive consultation for study design, including sample selection, subject preparation, technological methods for addressing specific scientific questions, statistical power considerations relevant to sample size and composition, data analytic approaches, brain-behavioral, brain-gene, and brain- environment data linkage, the interpretation of acquired neuroimaging data, and, via the Informatics Unit, its archival storage with other key study variables; 2) To conduct highly cost-efficient data acquisition for IDDRC investigators collecting neuroimaging data in IDD research efforts. This assistance will specify acquisition parameters for each study, implement appropriate subject preparation protocols (e.g. un-sedated infants), optimize image quality for the intended target structures and circuits, and provide all necessary technical support for conducting the scanning procedures, titrated to the need-for-assistance of each respective investigator; 3) To provide data processing and analytic services that optimize the hypothesis-driven analysis, exploration, as well as accurate interpretation of neuroimaging data in IDD research at WUSTL, recognizing that analysis of imaging data?and its integration with genomic, phenomic, and environmental data, can be complex and highly dependent upon the particular imaging modality employed."
"9335346","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are major public health problems. Obesity independent of its relationship with diabetes and hypertension is associated with the development and progression of kidney disease. However, higher body mass index (BMI) in those with pre-existing CKD is associated with lower mortality (obesity paradox). This may be due to the inability of BMI to differentiate fat mass and muscle mass, which may have opposite relationship with cardiovascular disease and death. Body fat distribution is a major factor of metabolic health with metabolic abnormalities correlating better with visceral than subcutaneous adipose tissue. Further, higher fitness levels among those with higher BMI are associated with a lower prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and mortality that might explain this obesity paradox. Therefore, among Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) study participants, we propose (a) to examine whether visceral adiposity is associated with a higher incidence of composite outcomes (i.e., mortality, cardiovascular events, end stage renal disease, and 50% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate), (b) to determine if physical fitness modifies the association between adiposity and outcomes, and (c) to study whether visceral adiposity and physical fitness are associated with altered adipokine profile, inflammation, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress. We propose to enroll 526 patients with varying degrees of kidney disease from 7 clinical centers involved in the CRIC study. Visceral adiposity will be measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen using a standard protocol, and physical fitness will be measured using a 400 m walk test during routine CRIC study visits. The imaging data will be assessed at the central reading center at the Cleveland Clinic, and samples will be analyzed at the University of Pennsylvania central core laboratory. We have assembled a well-experienced, multi-disciplinary team to address these important public health questions. Results from this study will help us understand the independent and combined effects of visceral adiposity and physical fitness on cardiovascular disease and kidney disease progression among CKD patients. This study will also highlight potential pathways that mediate the relationship between adiposity and outcomes, which will become the focus of future therapeutic investigations in CKD."
"9356302","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The life-span of people living with HIV has dramatically increased due to effective antiretroviral therapy, and we are now faced with managing HIV as a chronic disease. Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a significant HIV comorbidity that has been shown to negatively affect HIV disease and is associated with increased risk of HIV transmission, increased viremia, and a more accelerated progression to AIDS. Understanding the biological basis by which alcohol exacerbates HIV disease progression remains a major goal in the search for new innovative treatment strategies and the clinical management of HIV in chronically-infected populations. It is widely appreciated that the primary mediator of HIV disease is the virus, and several recent studies have begun to focus on early viral kinetics to better understand the nature of disease course. These studies have shown that rapid viral dissemination in reservoir tissues shortly after infection sets the future course for disease progression. For this reason, understanding how chronic alcohol consumption affects viral dynamics over the course of disease will provide new, multifaceted insights to the complex effects of alcohol on HIV disease. Recent studies using the SIV-infected macaque model have shown chronic binge alcohol (CBA) consumption affects early viral:host interactions leading to an increased susceptibility to intrarectal SIV challenge. Additionally, our preliminary data demonstrates CBA consumption alters viral dynamics by promoting genotypic selection and increasing viral reservoir expression. Taken together, the literature and our preliminary finding, support our central hypothesis that chronic alcohol consumption affects the establishment of founder viral reservoirs and their subsequent replication dynamics to accelerate disease progression. As part of the training of the applicant, the proposed studies will use an innovative approach to test the predictions that: 1) CBA administration increases the number and genotypic diversity of founder viral genotypes transmitted to macaques inoculated with SIVmac251, 2) CBA administration fosters the selection of SIV genotypes with increased expression kinetics in tissue reservoirs of macaques at set point, and 3) CBA administration increases compartment-specific viral expression, promoting SIV genotypic selection, despite continuous antiretroviral therapy (ART). These studies will identify how alcohol influences early viral selection and replication in the host and allow us to longitudinally assess their impact on disease progression. Furthermore, this study will aid the clinical management of HIV patients with AUD by providing evidence to optimize the selection and initiation of ART regimens and pre-exposure therapies."
"9452462","We are proposing a novel approach to diagnosing early Alzheimer?s disease (AD) and predicting progression via a robust biomarker that captures ?glymphatic? pathway transport on a systems level. The glymphatic pathway is a brain-wide system, which was recently discovered to function as a clearance pathway for toxic brain waste proteins including soluble amyloid beta (A?) and tau similarly to the classical body-wide lymphatic system. As such, the glymphatic pathway comprises a previously overlooked and unique compartment of the brain vasculature, the peri-vascular space wherein cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is flowing and streaming into the brain interstitial fluid (ISF) space thereby forcing waste solutes out of the brain. Except for rare familial AD, where excessive A? production and deposition in the brain clearly drives cognitive decline, there is limited evidence in the more common sporadic AD that cerebral A? accumulation is the result of A??overproduction. In fact, emerging evidence suggests that parenchymal A? accumulation in sporadic AD is driven by reduced A? clearance. The glymphatic pathway is thus a prime candidate for linking disruptive clearance of A? to AD, and we will use this opportunity to develop new tools and computational analysis aimed explicitly at capturing global glymphatic pathway function and serve as a novel diagnostic AD biomarker. Currently there is no method available to capture all of the intricate and dynamic components of glymphatic transport, in particular, parenchymal transport and clearance pathways. We propose to integrate imaging techniques and develop novel computational analysis including optimal mass transport to characterize the glymphatic pathway as a brain-wide dynamic ?unit?. The ultimate goal of the proposed investigation is to apply the glymphatic biomarker and track its disruption in progressing vascular and parenchymal amyloid pathologies. The proposed studies are based on novel preliminary findings that 1) glymphatic transport can be visualized as an integrative system through perivascular and interstitial spaces; 2) that state dependent changes induced by specific anesthetic regimens which dramatically affect the glymphatic transport can be captured by optimal mass transport analysis; and 3) a new transgenic rat model of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (rTg-SwDI) which will be used for specific hypothesis testing against the transgenic rat AD model (rTgF344-AD36) in the proposed studies. The specific aims are the following: (1) To develop biomarkers to visualize and functionally quantify macroscopic, glymphatic transport based on computational analysis of MRI and macroscopic optical imaging of CSF tracers in normal young (3 month old) rats and (2) to determine how and when normal aging and specific AD-like cerebral vascular and parenchymal amyloid pathologies influence glymphatic transport in the brain using the computational pipeline developed in SA1. Successful completion of the proposed highly innovative experiments will yield an entirely new and promising biomarker to track reduced Aß clearance via the glymphatic pathway which is key to the propagation of CAA and AD."
"9325603","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common and debilitating age-associated human neurodegenerative disorder. Clinically, PD is characterized by tremor, slowness of movement, stiffness, and postural instability. Pathologically, it is indicated by activation of glial cells and progressive degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons associated with the presence of intracytoplasmic inclusions (Lewy bodies). This application addresses an important aspect of PD. Although the rate of disease progression varies from patient to patient, PD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. However, the mechanism behind disease progression is poorly understood. We hypothesize that RANTES and eotaxin could hold the key for driving disease progression and that targeting these two chemokines may be an important strategy to control T cell infiltration and hence the disease progression in PD. Here this hypothesis will be tested from several experiments on mice, monkeys and humans. It is known that nigrostriatal pathology does not persist in acute MPTP mouse model. Under Specific aim I, we will investigate if supplementation of RANTES and eotaxin induces persistent and progressive disease in acute MPTP-intoxicated mice. Specific aim II has been planned to determine whether PD patients have higher levels of RANTES and eotaxin by monitoring the level of these two chemokines in serum of PD patients and age-matched controls. Finally, we have devoted the Specific aim III to delineate if blocking the functions of RANTES and eotaxin by maraviroc, an inhibitor of CCR5 and a FDA- approved drug, halt the disease progression in hemiparkinsonian monkeys. A positive outcome of this study will establish RANTES and eotaxin as targets for PD, translate CCR5-based treatment (maraviroc) to PD clinic, uncover the clue for the progression of PD, and find a drug to stop the progression of PD."
"9330685","Summary. Dysregulation of PTEN and MKP-1/DUSP1 by changes in expression/degradation, mutation, and/or post-translational modifications (PTMs) contribute to the progression of human diseases such as different cancers. MKP-1 (aka DUSP1) and PTEN are major negative regulatory phosphatase enzymes in the MAPK and PI3K/AKT cell signaling pathways, and both enzymes are subject to PTMs mapped to their C- terminal tails. MKP-1 is phosphorylated twice at positions 359 and 364, whereas PTEN is tetra-phosphorylated at positions 380, 382, 383, and 385 and acetylated at position 402 but there are large gaps in our understanding of the structural and functional impacts of these PTMs. Therefore, our goal is to elucidate the molecular basis for the PTM-dependent regulation of PTEN and MKP-1. Key to our proposal is the generation of semi-synthetic enzymes by expressed protein ligation that facilitates site-specific and stoichiometric insertion of the corresponding PTM(s) and their mimics to be use in these three specific aims: Specific aim 1 will determine the structural basis for the phosphorylation-dependent conformational closure of PTEN. Direct atomic interactions for the phosphorylated C-terminal tail with the PTEN body will be mapped by UV-induced photocrosslinking, which will contribute to a computational model that defines the position of the C-terminal tail when in the closed conformational state. The computational model will be tested by generating site-directed mutants and evaluating them with a series of biochemical assays, including enzyme activity, sensitivity to dephosphorylation by alkaline phosphatase, and lipid binding. Specific aim 2 utilizes a series of biochemical and cellular techniques to define the function of C-terminal (Lys402) acetylation of PTEN. This aim concerns the role of Lys402 acetylation in modulating PTEN's biochemical and cellular function(s) by elucidating its role in regulating enzyme activity, protein-protein interactions, subcellular localization, protein stability, and regulation of different signaling pathways. A series of biochemical and cellular methods will be executed to systematically define the regulatory role that this PTM has on PTEN's cellular function. Specific aim 3 employs a systematic approach to evaluate the role C-terminal phosphorylation has on the biochemical and cellular function of MKP-1. This aim seeks to define the biochemical and/or cellular consequences for these phosphorylation events with respect to enzyme activity, protein-protein interactions, subcellular localization, protein stability, and regulation of different signaling pathways. A series of biochemical and cellular assays will be employed to define how C-terminal phosphorylation regulates MKP-1 function. We anticipate discovering unique regulatory mechanisms for these PTMs that can pave the way to a deeper understanding of cell signaling and next generation therapies."
"9382827","PROJECT SUMMARY Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology using 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography Each year, 735,000 Americans have an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), and approximately 120,000 die from it. Heart attacks occur most commonly due to rupture of atherosclerotic plaques in coronary arteries. Despite this, current diagnostic and treatment algorithms make no allowance for the assessment of disease activity and currently all patients with atherosclerosis are treated in a similar manner. This failure to differentiate stable from active disease may result in potentially unnecessary or insufficient therapies. In a breakthrough series of studies, our co-investigators discovered that positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-sodium- fluoride (18F-NaF; an inexpensive and widely available tracer approved by Food and Drug Administration) can readily identify plaque rupture and increased coronary plaque activity. We propose to build further on this success, by addressing several important remaining limitations that prevent us from translating this technology to broad clinical use. The limitations include complicated and subjective image analysis, underutilization of the concomitant coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) for plaque characterization, inability to utilize prior CTA for the analysis of 18F-NaF PET, lack of methods to integrate all available PET and CTA data and significant motion of the coronaries during the PET scan. We propose a multi-faceted approach to automate and improve coronary 18F-NaF PET imaging by full integration with CTA and correction for cardiac, respiratory, and patient motion. The overall goal of the proposal is to optimize the measurement of disease activity in coronary atherosclerosis using integrated 18F-NaF PET/CTA imaging, with the opportunity to validate this development against clinical outcome in a ?real-world? multicenter patient study. For this work, we propose the following 3 specific aims: 1) to integrate quantification of CTA and PET image data 2) to develop new methods for simultaneous correction of cardiac, respiratory, and patient motion for coronary PET, and 3) to clinically evaluate new methods in a multicenter clinical trial (separately funded and already underway), further refining risk prediction for heart attacks with integrated PET+CTA risk score derived by machine learning. This work will lead to a robust and reproducible clinical method for stratification of patients for risk of heart attacks, with potential to be applied for the identification of patients who would most benefit from expensive, and potentially risky treatments. Our techniques could also be used in future clinical trials to test the efficacy of novel therapies. Moreover, the new analysis will be applicable to other PET tracers that may be developed to investigate other pathological processes in the coronary vasculature. The resulting software will be shared with clinical institutions performing coronary PET to facilitate standardization and automation of this novel plaque imaging technique."
"9537098","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Virtually all smoking cessation interventions have been conducted on smokers who indicate a willingness to quit smoking. Much less well-studied are approaches for assisting smokers who are not ready to quit smoking at the current time (ex., not in the next 30 days). The paucity of research on smokers not ready to quit smoking is present despite the fact that the majority of smokers are not ready to quit smoking at any given point in time. While almost 69% of smokers want to quit at some time in the future, fewer than 10% of smokers are ready to make a serious smoking cessation attempt in the next 30 days. There have been two different approaches towards increasing cessation rates in smokers not ready to quit (SNRTQ). The first approach Motivational Interviewing (MI) using 5Rsas a foundation (Relevance, Risks, Rewards, Roadblocks, Repetition). However, only one study, which is a decade old, has evaluated the impact of MI with SNRTQ - with MI producing both higher quit attempts and smoking cessation than a) reduction counseling using nicotine replacement therapy plus brief advice alone and b) no treatment. The second approach combined behavioral/pharmacological rate reduction as an approach to produce reductions in tobacco use as well as to enhance self-efficacy for smoking cessation Combined behavioral/pharmacologic rate reduction has been shown to more than double the odds of cessation in SNRTQ. To our knowledge, no study has evaluated the independent effects of MI and Rate Reduction, individually versus in combination, for motivating SNRTQ to increase both quit attempts and tobacco abstinence. Thus, we propose the following Specific Aims: (1) To test a tobacco Quit Line for SNRTQ; (2) To randomize 2100 SNRTQs to: (a) Brief Advice + typical smoking cessation resources (control group); (b) Motivational Interviewing using the 5Rs (MI/5Rs) format recommended by the Clinical Practice Guidelines; (c) Combined behavioral and pharmacologic Rate Reduction, and (d) both MI/5Rs + combined behavioral and pharmacologic Rate Reduction. This design allows us to evaluate the independent and additive effects of MI and Rate Reduction on quit attempts and smoking cessation; (3) to evaluate the efficacy of the intervention. The primary endpoint will be point prevalence at the 6-month post-intervention follow-up (12 months after randomization). Prolonged abstinence at the 6-month post intervention follow-up and quit attempts at the 2-, 4- and 6-month and the 6-month post intervention follow-up are secondary endpoints, and; (4) To determine the cost effectiveness (cost per quit smoker) of each of the interventions. The current proposal addresses the underserved population of SNRTQ is highly significant, innovative, and has a tremendous public health impact."
"9323417","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hemogenic endothelial cells (HE) represent a rare cell population that gives rise to hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) through a process referred to as endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT). EHT is a key developmental stage required to produce the mature, adult hematopoietic system. The underlying mechanisms that regulate human definitive hematopoiesis remain poorly elucidated. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) provide a well-defined cellular platform that can be used to study these mechanisms and to improve the in vitro production of HSCs potentially suitable for clinical applications. Recent studies suggest the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a critical regulator of HSC development. However, it is unknown whether AHR signaling is required for definitive hematopoietic induction from human HE. My preliminary studies suggest that AHR is expressed in low levels in undifferentiated hESCs and becomes upregulated immediately after hematopoietic induction. Based on these studies in hESCs and other developmental models, I hypothesize AHR negatively regulates early hematoendothelial development from human HE. I will test this central hypothesis in two specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, I will determine the rol of AHR in definitive hematopoietic development from hESCs. I hypothesize blocking or eliminating AHR signaling will enhance definitive hematopoietic development. Our lab has formuated well-defined conditions to support the differentiation of hematopoietic cells from hESCs. Here, I will utilize small molecule antagonists and agonists of the AHR as well as CRISPR/Cas9 endonuclease gene editing to assess the effects AHR has in generating definitive hematopoietic cells. In Specific Aim 2, I will perform single-cell genomic analysis to characterize human HE and non-HE subpopulations derived from hESCs. Previous studies are confounding since there is no universally accepted definition of HE and most studies examine a heterogenous population of cells. My preliminary studies have utilized a combination of genetic expression with RUNX1c, a key EHT gene, with a CD34+CD144+CD41-CD43- phenotype that allows us to isolate a putative HE population derived from hESCs. Using these cells, I hypothesize a distinct HE population with a unique genetic signature can be identified in cells derived from hESCs. This signature will further allow us to determine how key hematopoietic and endothelial genes are regulated by the AHR signaling pathway. Collectively, these studies are significant in that they will provide novel information on the identity of human HE and how the AHR pathway contributes to EHT. The results of these studies will be broadly applicable in improving the production of patient-specific HSCs suitable for transplantation in individuals with various hematological diseases. Moreover, this application provides a rigorous, yet defined scientific and mentoring framework to foster my career goals of becoming a successful academic physician-scientist."
"9317727","Principal Investigator (Last, First): Hall, Drew A. ABSTRACT The world?s population requires affordable and reliable diagnosis for effective healthcare. Infectious diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus, Zika virus, Dengue Fever, and Ebola virus represent significant global health threats, yet the frequent and pervasive testing required for full control or universal eradication remain out of reach in many settings due to the costs and limitations of current technologies. While modern diagnostics are becoming increasingly more sensitive and great gains have been made in portability and affordability, no single technique provides an ideal mix of sensitivity, specificity, and the ability to simultaneously diagnose multiple diseases. Thus, the healthcare system remains fragmented and must maintain several types of tests and testing platforms. While this remains feasible in the developed world, it is nearly impossible in many remote and resource limited settings. We propose a method for simultaneous point-of-care (POC) disease diagnosis based on electrochemical detection of pathogen directed host responses. This immune profile, or immunosignature (IMS), is a measurement of the profile of circulating antibodies in an individual at a specific time. This profile changes in response to disease. In the case of infection, it provides an evaluation of the host?s response similar to an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), rather than a direct measure of the pathogen itself. There are ~1 billion different antibodies circulating in the blood at any time, and when an infection occurs (or another disease that presents new antigens), a subset of antibodies will be amplified by up to 1011 fold. As such, Immunosignaturing not only has higher sensitivity and specificity than current immunodiagnostics, but is disease agnostic: it is a multidimensional evaluation of the humeral immune system as a whole, and thus can be used to detect and identify any disease with a significant antibody response (even retrospectively), from less than a pinprick of blood. Existing fluorescent-based Immunosignaturing technology remains expensive ($100 per sample) and laboratory bound. We hypothesize that the Immunosignaturing method may be adapted to an electrochemical sensing technique that would dramatically lower production costs, increase scalability, and portability by piggybacking on the annual advancements in the multibillion-dollar semiconductor industry. In this two year effort, we aim to lay the groundwork for a low-cost POC diagnostic platform that could ultimately allow the simultaneous diagnosis of a significant portion of the global burden of disease.

"9363990","Uric acid (UA) is a terminal metabolite of the purine metabolic pathway in humans. Excess UA, the clinical disorder hyperuricemia, affects 43 million Americans causing gout and increasing risk for hypertension, stroke, metabolic syndrome, and chronic kidney disease. A genetic and physiological approach led to our identification of the multidrug transporter ABCG2 as a high capacity UA efflux transporter and that common ABCG2 variants make the largest genetic contribution to increased UA levels and gout risk. Although the genetic role of ABCG2 in hyperuricemia and gout risk is now well established, we know little of the physiological role of ABCG2 as a renal UA transporter. The process of UA homeostasis is by necessity a dynamic process as diet and metabolism produce highly variable UA loads. Thus, the overarching goal of this proposal is to develop a mechanistic explanation of how ABCG2 mediated renal UA excretion is physiologically regulated, and how dysfunction of the process leads to hyperuricemia and human disease. The AIMs of our proposal will address the following three questions: 1) Is ABCG2 physiologically regulated in vivo and a critical component of UA homeostasis? 2) What role does phosphorylation play in regulating ABCG2 and renal UA excretion? and 3) How does the common ABCG2 gout mutation Q141K alter ABCG2 regulation and the physiology of renal UA excretion? This work will provide a new understanding of the molecular mechanisms of urate homeostasis and illuminate both the consequences of dysregulated hyperuricemia on human health, and novel therapeutic targets for treatment."
"9298610","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) constitute a heterogeneous and poorly understood pathological group of non-Hodgkin lymphomas associated with poor prognosis. Little is known on the genetics and mechanisms of this disease and better diagnostic tools, prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets are urgently needed in the clinic. Recently we have identified new genetic alterations in PTCL transformation by using a combination of whole exome sequencing of tumor-normal DNA pairs, RNAseq analysis and targeted deep sequencing of candidate genes. Our data identified highly recurrent mutations in the RHOA oncogene including a highly prevalent RHOA G17V allele present in almost 70% of angioimmunoblastic T- cell lymphomas (AITL) and almost 20% of PTCL not otherwise specified (PTCL NOS) samples. Our central hypothesis is that the RHOA G17V mutation acts as a negative regulator of RHOA signaling and as an oncogenic driver of PTCL. The goals of this research are to identify the mechanisms and pathways by which RHOA G17V contribute to T-cell transformation and to analyze the oncogenic effects of this mutation in the pathogenesis of AITL in vivo using a mouse model of RhoA G17V induced lymphoma."

"9430738","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The highly infectious Gram-negative Brucella remains a global health threat and is responsible for the disease, brucellosis. In humans, B. melitensis is believed to be responsible for most infections, and it is naturally transmitted via ingestion of unpasteurized dairy products or aerosols of infected animal products resulting in infection of naso-oropharyngeal tissues. Although infection primarily occurs following a mucosal exposure, it can cause a systemic disease manifested by its flu-like symptoms. Despite aggressive antibiotic treatment, it can still result in a recurring sequelae evident as undulant fever and arthritis. Brucellae survival within the host is linked to its ability to evade intracellular recognition, thu, allowing them to sequester in various tissues. Vaccines that can recapitulate aspects of Brucella infection should prove effective in protecting against infection. Hence, we hypothesize that a vaccine that mimics aspects of natural mucosal B. melitensis infections and capable of stimulating cell-mediated immunity via the production of TNF-a and IFN-g will be protective against mucosal and systemic Brucella challenges. To enable this approach, we have recently developed a vaccine prototype that can confers complete protection in most cases with no detectable brucellae in spleens or lungs. Given the potency of this vaccine, we propose to test our hypothesis using two animal models to determine the efficacy of this vaccine against wild-type B. melitensis challenges. Studies in Specific Aim 1 will establish a mucosal (oral, nasal, or oral + nasal) immunization strategy for conferring protection to B. melitensis and to heterologous Brucella species. Studies in Specific Aim 2 will establish similar mucosal immunization strategy in goats, a natural host for B. melitensis, for conferring protection against B. melitensis-induced abortion. Studies in Specific Aim 3 will evaluate the biosafety of this vaccine to warrant future clinical testing. Thus, these studies will show that our oral/nasal vaccine can protect against Brucella challenges in two different experimental animal models."
"9386676","Project Summary  The aim of this proposal is to develop a molecular understanding of disruption of RNA metabolism in repeat expansion disorders. Unstable repeat expansions underlie over 30 genetically inherited diseases including fragile X syndrome, myotonic dystrophy, Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In many of these diseases, the repeats are in the non-coding regions of the genome and the transcribed RNA accumulates as inclusions in neurons and other affected cell types. Thus, a prevailing model is that these diseases are caused by an RNA gain-of-function mechanism, where RNA assumes toxic properties leading to cytotoxicity and tissue degeneration. However, the molecular mechanisms of RNA foci formation remain poorly understood, and it is not currently known how the repeat expansions confer this gain-of-function behavior to the RNA.  This project will apply a suite of interdisciplinary approaches to understand the molecular basis of RNA foci formation. The working hypothesis is that the sequence specific properties of the RNA alone are sufficient to induce RNA aggregation, and this RNA aggregation leads to foci formation. Biophysical underpinnings of RNA aggregation will be characterized in vitro using reconstitution approaches. Model cell culture systems will be used to study the effect of aging and environmental insults in promoting RNA foci formation and cytotoxicity. Finally, the cell culture systems will be used to screen for compounds that inhibit foci formation.  The candidate for this Pathway to Independence Award is a biophysicist with expertise in microscopy and has developed biochemical methods to characterize RNA aggregation in vitro. Through this mentored training grant, the candidate will gain additional training in neuroscience and aging research, which will be essential to translate the in vitro findings to clinically relevant disease models. The candidate will work with neuroscientists and clinician-scientists at UCSF who have established programs in neurodegenerative diseases. Candidate's primary mentor, Prof. Ron Vale, is a renowned cell biologist.

"9380597","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Snakebite victims often present with sepsis-like symptoms, such as edema and respiratory distress syndrome. Analyses of snake venoms have identified a family of proteases characteristic of disintegrin metalloproteases (ADAMs) with the capability to cleave transmembrane molecules. Our previous work supported by this grant has focused on a unique member of this family, ADAM15, with respect to its molecular structure and function in regulating endothelial barrier property. We reported ADAM15 upregulation in the lungs and vascular tissues during inflammation, where it increases endothelial permeability and promotes leukocyte migration via Src- dependent signaling transduced by its cytoplasmic domain. In this renewal application, we plan to bring our investigation on ADAM15 to the next level by examining its novel molecular targets with high translational values and therapeutic potential. The studies will focus on endothelial glycocalyx, a barrier protective structure composed of glycosaminoglycan chains linked to transmembrane proteoglycans and glycoproteins, which are shed into the circulation following injury or major surgery. The central pathway to be tested is that during septic injury, ADAM15 cleaves these transmembrane molecules leading to glycocalyx degradation. The exposure of endothelium to circulating cells and agents, along with shedding products acting as hyperpermeability factors, promotes plasma leakage and leukocyte diapedesis. Three specific aims are proposed: 1) to characterize ADAM-induced glycocalyx injury during sepsis; 2) to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which ADAM causes glycocalyx degradation; and 3) to test the therapeutic potential of targeting the ADAM-glycocalyx pathway for treating sepsis. We will employ complementary approaches that integrate physiological responses and molecular reactions at organ, tissue, and cell levels. Innovative experimental models and therapies will be tested. A unique design is the characterization of lung pathophysiology under clinically relevant conditions, taking advantage of the available intact viable human organs provided by a federally certified organ procurement organization. Data derived from the proposed work will provide new mechanistic insights into the molecular pathogenesis of sepsis. The study will also assist in the identification and development of novel therapeutic targets for treating vascular inflammatory injury associated with infection, trauma or major surgery."
"9202629","Project Summary  An estimated 347 million people worldwide have diabetes, including over 29.1 million Americans. A major cause of morbidity and hospitalization in patients with diabetes is diabetic foot ulceration (DFU), which can result in infection, amputation, prolonged hospitalization, and costly treatments. Diabetes treatments cost the American healthcare system ~$245 billion annually, representing 20% of the total healthcare expenditure; and DFU treatment consumes ~50% of these costs. Chronic diabetic wounds remain stalled in the initial inflammatory phase of wound healing and remain unresponsive to conventional treatments. Current treatment approaches tend to have limited to marginal efficacy and high cost. A large unmet need exists for safe, cost- effective therapeutics that are easily applied in the home care or clinical setting and conform to practice of medicine in DFU care without reducing efficacy.  FirstString Research, Inc., a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company, is advancing the development of novel bioengineered peptides based on the C-terminus of connexin proteins; a protein with important roles in the wound healing process. Our lead peptide, aCT1 (25 amino acids) based on connexin43, has demonstrated a unique capability of switching the body's healing response from excessive inflammation and scarring to a healthy regenerative stage. With the assistance of SBIR/STTR grants and significant private funding, FirstString has developed aCT1 in a topical product called Granexin® gel (Granexin); obtained IND approval; and demonstrated its mechanism of action, safety, and efficacy in a Phase 1 (N=48) and three Phase 2 clinical trials (N=276). Tissue injuries treated with Granexin show clinically and statistically significant faster healing, reduced inflammation, and improved mechanical properties without treatment related adverse events.  FirstString has received Phase IIb SBIR funding to continue clinical development and evaluate the efficacy and safety of Granexin in a larger clinical trial currently underway. During the End of Phase 2 meeting, the FDA requested a 9-month repeat dose pig study as an integral part of Granexin's NDA (New Drug Approval) review process, in line with FDA's Guidance for Industry in the development and approval for chronic wound therapeutics. The Specific Aim of this CRP SB1 project is to conduct a standard 39-week repeat dose GLP dermal toxicity study of Granexin® gel in the Göttingen mini-pig followed by a 14-day recovery. Subaim 1 involves the assessment of the safety of repeat topical dosing of Granexin at low (100 ?M), medium (200 ?M), and high (500 ?M) concentrations, with appropriate controls, on skin wounds that will be rewounded every 15 days. Subaim 2 will involve the toxicokinetic analysis of aCT1 peptide and assessment of systemic exposure. This study is similar to our previously conducted 92-day repeat dose toxicity study in pigs. Successful completion of this aim will fill in a necessary gap in obtaining NDA approval for Granexin from the FDA and support the eventual market launch of Granexin for the treatment of DFUs."
"9543151","PROJECT SUMMARY A delicate regulatory balance must be achieved in cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems to effectively eliminate pathogens, while minimizing damage to neighboring tissues. Defects in regulatory mechanisms that govern expression of cellular or soluble mediators can interfere with pathogen clearance or lead to unchecked inflammatory responses associated with autoimmunity. Recent studies have revealed that the innate immune system includes functional counterparts of T helper (Th) cells, which lack antigen-specific receptors and respond with enhanced kinetics and vigor to danger signals induced by pathogenic insults. The Th counterparts, called innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In discovery-driven profiling studies supported by an R21, the Co-PIs have recently defined the regulatory landscapes of Th-ILC counterparts derived from inflamed human mucosae, revealing collection of enhancers and super-enhancers that may control the expression of key immune mediators. Moreover, many enhancers that were active in specific ILC or Th subsets co-localized with autoimmune-associated disease SNPs, suggesting the regulatory elements may be important for controlling expression levels of nearby genes that mediate autoimmune pathogenesis. Despite this progress, the precise role of these potentially important regulatory elements in cell type-, agonist-, and disease-specific gene expression remains unclear. The goal of this project is to address these outstanding issues, focusing on regulation of the IL22-IL23R-IL1R1-STAT3 axis, which is critical for immune function of ILC3-Th17 counterparts and is rich in autoimmune-associated SNPs. The Co-PIs will also define and test key aspects of ILC3 regulomes that control their functional conversion to ILC1, a process implicated in IBD pathogenesis. To achieve this goal, we will leverage the Co-PIs' complementary expertise. Dr. Colonna's lab discovered several ILC subsets and contributed to our understanding of their biology in mice and humans. Dr. Oltz's lab studies cis-regulatory circuits that drive lymphocyte development and transformation. Three specific aims are proposed to test the hypotheses that: (i) unique sets of enhancers are critical for cell type- and agonist-specific expression of IL22 and IFNG, (ii) a subset of disease-associated SNPs disrupts transcription factor binding and enhancer function to alter IL23R, STAT3, or IL1R expression in ILC3 and Th17 cells during autoimmune pathogenesis, and (iii) ILC3?ILC1 conversion requires full activation of ILC1-associated enhancers that remain poised in ILC3 and, conversely, a decommissioning of ILC3-specific enhancers, perhaps converting them to a poised state. Together, our project will identify key features of the ILC-Th regulomes that dominate expression patterns of genes involved in autoimmunity, providing insights into independent roles of cytokine expressing cells in pathogenesis, and ultimately opening new therapeutic avenues."
"9408399","ABSTRACT  Invasive fungal infections are a leading cause of death in patients with compromised immune systems. With a 40%-60% mortality rate, invasive aspergillosis, due primarily to Aspergillus fumigatus, surpasses invasive candidiasis as the most frequent fungal cause of death. Following IA, the greatest fungal killers are other invasive mold infections (e.g., Fusarium, Scedosporium, and mucormycosis). Successful treatment of these invasive mold infections is notoriously difficult due to inadequate clinical efficacy of current drugs, lack of activity against increasingly resistant strains, antifungal toxicity, drug interactions, and requirements of drug monitoring. Innovative agents that exploit novel targets and are active against resistant strains are critically needed.  Our unique effort to identify novel therapeutics to treat IA has focused on targeting the fungal protein Gwt1 synthase. The Gwt1 enzyme is part of a multistep process required for the assembly of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored mannoproteins that form the outermost component of the critically important fungal cell wall. This antifungal target is important due to: 1) the paramount role of Gwt1 in maintaining fungal cell wall integrity; 2) low homology (<30% amino acid sequence identity) with the closest mammalian ortholog, PIG-W, enabling selective inhibition of Gwt1; and 3) the potential to avoid cross-resistance with existing antifungals due to the completely new mechanism of action. Amplyx Pharmaceuticals is currently in Phase 1 clinical trials with APX001, the first-in-class prodrug of the Gwt1 inhibitor APX001A. We will leverage our extensive structure-activity relationship expertise to create new Gwt1 inhibitors with greater antifungal activity against Aspergillus spp. as well as other rare invasive mold infections with the goal of identifying a differentiated back-up compound to combat the significant mortality associated with these invasive fungal infections. Aim 1. Synthesize a compound library ?30 Gwt1 analogs in an iterative synthesis/screening process. Aim 2. Characterize and select compounds for advancement through extensive in vitro studies. We will assess: 2a) antifungal activity against A. fumigatus and rare molds; 2b) target engagement; 2c) cytotoxicity; 2d) expanded antifungal activity against resistant strains; 2e) cell permeability (Caco-2 cells); 2f) microsomal stability; 2g) formulation testing; 2h) hERG interaction; and 2i) cytochrome P450 isoform interaction. Aim 3. Assess up to 5 lead compounds in murine dosing, IA and mucormycosis efficacy studies, and advanced microbiology assays. We will define: 3a) pharmacokinetics (PK); 3b) maximum tolerated dose (MTD); 3c) reduction in fungal burden; 3d) survival; 3e) time kill; and 3f) development of resistance. Impact: Successful completion will trigger IND-enabling studies of a novel, broad-spectrum Gwt1 antifungal agent, which is acutely needed for empiric treatment in high-risk patients, given the complexity of accurate early diagnosis of invasive fungal infections."
"9386005","Project Summary  Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is an incurable, progressive disease that affects both adults and children. While many pathophysiologic similarities exist between adult and pediatric pulmonary hypertension, the number of life years lost in children is much greater given limited long-term survival. Pediatric PAH is distinct from adult disease in the fact that the initial insult occurs during a critical period of maturation and lung development. Hemodynamic abnormalities in the developing lung may impact treatment response and the natural history of the disease in ways that have not been shown; and can remain a strong contributing factor in disease progression. Despite significant unique factors in pediatric PAH, research of this group is lacking, forcing the use of adult-based guidelines and therapies. As a result, management of pediatric PAH includes using invasive right heart catheterization (RHC) for serial diagnostic/prognostic evaluation. Serial RHC is costly, exposes children to repeated anesthesia and excessive radiation, and importantly, children undergoing catheterization for PAH may have catastrophic events including cardiorespiratory arrest and death. Despite these challenges inherent to an invasive procedure, there is no alternative for evaluating therapeutic direction for pediatric patients. This is a significant factor for the lack of research and targeted therapies for this vulnerable population.  Cardiac MRI is the single imaging modality that allows assessment of both the ventricle and the vasculature involved in PAH pathophysiology, without radiation exposure or anesthesia in older children. In adult studies, MRI is emerging as a technique for evaluating vascular function, including, recently, vorticity and helicity by 4-dimensional (4D) velocity- encoded MRI. MRI also has the ability to evaluate the pulmonary vascular structure with high spatial resolution and may demonstrate developmental vascular changes in PAH. Our overall hypothesis is that MRI will reflect pulmonary hemodynamic status in patients with PAH similar to conventional RHC. Our long-range goal is to show that non-invasive imaging modality can diagnose and serially monitor PAH children and possibly minimize the need for RHC. Furthermore, novel vascular imaging by 4D MRI, along with conventional MRI, in the proximal vasculature will quantify significant alterations in maturing vascular function in children with PAH. MRI may be a powerful in identifying targeted therapy unique for children."

The goals of the study are to define the natural history of AKI; to evaluate the impact of the presence and severity of AKI on renal, cardiovascular and other clinical and patient-centered outcomes; and to identify predictors of adverse events after an episode of AKI. The ASSESS- AKI PCCs represent a broad spectrum of clinical settings ranging from cardiothoracic surgery to intensive care units to general hospital floors in a geographically diverse research consortium. The proposed ASSESS-AKI- Phase 2 will extend follow-up through September 30, 2018. It will offer a unique opportunity to leverage the existing effort and success of ASSESS-AKI-Phase 1 through long-term prospective follow-up of a matched cohort of participants with and without initial AKI for a variety of clinical outcomes that will support addressing novel scientific goals. The enclosed application is in response to RFA-DK-12-509, Limited Competition for the Continuation of the Assessment, Serial Evaluation, and Subsequent Sequelae of Acute Kidney Injury (ASSESS-AKI) Study (U01), on behalf of the Kaiser Permanente Northern California/University of California, San Francisco PCC. The six Specific Aims to be addressed by the participating PCC sites and Data Coordinating Center are: Aim 1) To re-enroll a high percentage of ASSESS-AKI participants into Phase 2; Aim 2) To maintain outstanding levels of retention, data quality and outcome ascertainment among ASSESS-AKI participants; Aim 3) To evaluate the association between AKI and markers of cardiac ischemia, fibrosis, and endothelial dysfunction as potential contributors to excess cardiovascular risk in patients with AKI; Aim 4) To examine the impact of AKI on the future development of metabolic disturbances among ASSESS-AKI participants; Aim 5) To employ unbiased proteomic techniques to identify novel urinary protein biomarkers at 3 months after an episode of transient AKI that identify patients at risk for progressive renal dysfunction; and Aim 6) To promote and support the conduct of ancillary studies in ASSESS-AKI, including collaboration with the broader nephrology research community. Through the ongoing participation of the PCCs, ASSESS-AKI-Phase 2 will become an unparalleled resource that will expand the science related to AKI natural history as well as the impact of AKI on the development and progression of CKD, cardiovascular disease, survival, quality of life, functional status and other important outcomes."
"9494977","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the revised application NIH R01-AG046928-01, titled Effects of physical activity on brain function and network connectivity in MCI. The overall goal of this project is to assess the effect of physical activity on remediating early impairments in brain function in sedentary older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is the most common cause of cognitive impairment in older adults. The need for effective treatments has become imperative, as 36 million people worldwide are affected and counting. The results from several large pharmacological trials have been sobering with a lack of significant clinical outcomes, prompting a paradigm shift to initiate treatment earlier in the disease process and explore non-pharmacological interventions. Physical activity has recently emerged as a promising intervention for delaying disease onset and slowing cognitive decline in AD. However, the effect of physical activity on neurobiological mechanisms of action, such as brain activity and network function in at risk older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a preclinical stage of AD, remains largely unexplored. Thus, there is a need for well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCT) examining functional brain health outcomes of physical activity intervention in this vulnerable population. The objective of this proposal is to evaluate physical activity as an intervention for improving functional brain health by remediating hippocampal dysfunction and enhancing functional network connectivity in MCI. Using a unique interdisciplinary approach of modern neuroscientific methodology in an RCT, a comprehensive set of outcomes will be evaluated. This project will recruit 90 sedentary participants between 50-85 years of age with amnestic MCI. Consistent with the current Surgeon General's recommendation on moderate-intensity exercise, participants will be randomly assigned to one of three home-based groups for a 6-month intervention period: 1) aerobic walking for 150 mins/week, 2) stretching active-control for 150 mins/week, and 3) health education non-active control, with 30 participants in each group. We will examine the effects of physical activity on th primary neuroimaging outcomes of regional BOLD activity in the hippocampal, functional connectivity between the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, and intrinsic connectivity of the default mode and executive networks. Additionally, we will examine secondary outcomes of brain volume, cognition, function, and serum biomarkers associated with physical activity. The effect of regional AD pathology on change in the outcome measures will be examined using amyloid PET."
"9540970","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our research application is addressing PQ8: Why do certain mutational events promote cancer phenotypes in some tissues and not in others? The goal of our proposed research is to identify factors responsible for tissue-selective tumorigenesis following inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene. Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), a familial cancer syndrome characterized by tissue-restricted tumorigenesis, provides a unique and tractable model with which to accomplish this goal. Bi-allelic inactivation of Men1, a ubiquitously expressed tumor suppressor encoding the transcription factor menin, is required for tumorigenesis in MEN1. Our experiments using Cre-lox deletion of Men1 demonstrates that differential inactivation of Men1 in various tissues does not explain the tissue restricted nature of tumors in MEN1. Rather, additional factors are required to enhance or suppress tumorigenesis in tissues that have lost Men1. For example, homozygous deletion of Men1 in all cells of the pancreas results in tumors in the endocrine tissue but not exocrine tissue of the same organ. Given that inactivation of Men1 is tightly linked to MEN1, we postulate that operation of these modulating factors is regulated by loss of menin. Our central hypothesis is that loss of menin differentially regulates expression of factors that influence carcinogenesis in various tissues so as to generate the tissue restricted characteristic of tumor formation in MEN1. To test this hypothesis, we propose to undertake both unbiased, genome wide screens and candidate approaches to identify relevant factors. Aim 1 employs ChIP- Seq and RNA-Seq respectively to identify DNA binding sites for menin that are differentially occupied and transcriptomes that are differentially expressed in tissues that develop MEN1 tumors versus those that do not. Specifically, we will compare tissues from the endocrine pancreas (develops tumors) versus the exocrine pancreas (does not develop tumors). Aim 2 will validate these findings in the parathyroid gland, a second site of tumor development in MEN1. Aim 3 will explore the role of the candidate protein ARC, an apoptosis inhibitor and cell cycle promoter that has already been implicated in mammary carcinogenesis. Our preliminary studies show that ARC is up-regulated by deletion of Men1 in the endocrine pancreas and parathyroid gland, but not in the exocrine pancreas. Moreover, ChIP-CHIP studies suggest that menin binds to the promoter of nol3, the gene encoding ARC. Taken together, these studies will provide novel and important insights into why tumors develop in some tissues and not in others following loss of a tumor suppressor gene."
"9387238","Efforts to personalize mental health and substance use prevention programs with underserved, impoverished racial minority youth require an understanding of the social environment risk factors that become biologically embedded to shape risk for poor health trajectories. Among African American (AA) youth from impoverished communities, exposure to violence, racial discrimination, poor neighborhood conditions, and stressful life events all impact risk for emotional and behavioral health problems, including symptoms of anxiety and depression, conduct/aggression problems, and substance use. Protective features of the neighborhood environment, however, can partially mitigate these risks. The biological processes by which stressors come to increase the risk for poor emotional/behavioral health is not well understood but likely involve changes in epigenetically-related processes including DNA methylation and telomere length (TL). The present study utilizes a well-characterized sample of 537 AA youth from high-poverty neighborhoods, among whom extensive assessments of life experiences, neighborhood environment, behavioral phenotyping, and genome- wide genetic polymorphisms have already been conducted. Utilizing a variety of cutting-edge methodologies spanning behavioral sciences and molecular and statistical genetics, we will examine genome-wide DNA methylation and TL as biological mediators of stress effects on emotional/behavioral health among impoverished AA youth. We also test for the moderating role of resilience-enhancing protective factors, sex, and genotype, all of which have been understudied in relation to methylation and TL. We propose to: (1) determine whether environmental stressors, including racial discrimination, exposure to violence, and neighborhood ecology are associated with DNA methylation and TL, reflective of a biological embedding of stress; (2) examine stress-linked variations in methylation and TL as mediators of stress effects on emotional/behavioral health; (3) identify social environment protective factors, including neighborhood factors, that could potentially buffer impacts of stress on health outcomes, and test for sex differences; (4) explore the role of genotype as a contributing factor to the relations between environmental stress, methylation, TL, and emotional/behavioral health. This research is innovative for its inclusion of both individual and neighborhood- level predictors, both risk and protective factors, and both social environment and genotype among a difficult- to-reach population of impoverished AA youth. Identifying stressors and resilience-enhancing protective factors with the strongest links to biological changes and behavioral functioning will aid in the development of tailored preventive intervention efforts for vulnerable minority youth residing in high-poverty neighborhoods."
"9313734","7. Project Summary/Abstract This Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) will develop the applicant, Dr. LaTrice Montgomery, into an independent investigator who can evaluate digital health technologies to improve engagement and treatment of cannabis and tobacco co-use among African American young adults. The career plan proposes training and stage IA-IB intervention development research and extends the applicant?s prior research and training to address career development goals in three areas: 1) clinical trials methodology and longitudinal data analysis, especially for smoking cessation trials (Winhusen), 2) the development of internet- based social media interventions to address co-use of cannabis and tobacco among African American young adults (Prochaska and Budney) and 3) mixed methods research (Plano Clark). These goals will be accomplished through formal coursework, seminars, and conferences under the mentorship of leaders in the addiction field. In this application, three related studies will be conducted that build on the applicant?s training goals and will contribute to an increased understanding of how social media can be applied to promote blunt use reduction among African American young adults. Blunts (hollowed-out tobacco cigar shells that are filled with cannabis) are widely used among African American young adults and have been associated with more severe cannabis use problems, such as inability to cut down use, and health problems, such as an increased risk of cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases due to high levels of carbon monoxide exposure. Despite these negative drug use and health effects, few interventions have been designed to address blunt use, especially among African American young adults. Social media sites, such as Twitter, present unique opportunities to deliver online health-based interventions due to their popularity and ability to reach underserved and vulnerable populations who might be reluctant to enter or remain engaged in traditional substance abuse treatment. The applicant will therefore apply the training and skills acquired from this award to the following research aims: (1) use mixed methods to characterize the cultural norms, patterns of blunt use, quit experiences, treatment needs, and attitudes and preferences toward social-media based interventions for blunt use reduction among African American young adults, (2) draw integrated conclusions from mixed methods data to inform the development and pilot testing of a Twitter-based intervention and 3) conduct a small randomized clinical trial to test the acceptability, feasibility and initial efficacy of a Twitter-based treatment intervention for African American young adult blunt smokers. The training experience and results from the proposed work will position the applicant to pursue future independent NIH funding to develop this line of research and adapt and test future internet-based social media interventions for cannabis and tobacco co-use among African American young adults."

"9315611","The Clinical Translational (CT) Core addresses the challenges facing investigators who conduct human  behavioral and biobehavioral research on IDD conditions, such as autism, fragile X syndrome, and Down  syndrome. Participants can be difficult to recruit because of their relatively low prevalence in the general  population. Moreover, once recruited, these participants require evaluations by professionals with specialized  training to confirm diagnoses and determine whether inclusion/exclusion criteria are met. Recruitment of  typically developing control participants can also be challenging, particularly for studies of young children that  require biologic sampling or neuroimaging because parents are often reluctant to enroll. The CT Core is  designed to help IDDRC investigators overcome these challenges by providing services that include participant  recruitment, community outreach, initial diagnostic qualification, assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria,  and allocation of personnel and resources for these activities. The CT Core staff and resources dedicated to  these activities will significantly diversify the available pool of participants; improve cost effectiveness  efficiency, and productivity by sharing participant qualification characteristics across projects; and provide  resources that are beyond the expertise or budget of specific investigators but are essential to the highest  quality behavioral and biobehavioral science. The individuals and infrastructure associated with the proposed  CT Core have provided similar services to many funded studies at the MIND Institute over the last dozen  years, although these services were more limited in scope and were not previously integrated into a single  organizational structure. The integration proposed and the expansion afforded by the support of the  IDDRC U54 grant (and the additional institutional support of the MIND Institute and UC Davis) will  increase efficiency, lower costs of services thereby encouraging greater use by IDDRC investigators,  expand diagnostic evaluation services, and increase recruitment efforts, especially as regards the  recruitment of ethnically, racially, and economically diverse participants.  The primary objective of the CT Core is to establish and maintain an operational framework that is optimal  for recruitment and diagnostic assessment and characterization of a diverse range of special and typical  populations. We will achieve this objective by addressing the following Specific Aims:  1. Enhance recruitment of a diverse range of participants through a systematic process of community  engagement, including multiple ethnicities, races, and economic backgrounds with both atypical and typical  development across a wide age span.  2. Maintain a participant registry and tracking system that includes critical descriptive information,  permitting investigators to select participants for recruitment who are most likely to meet specific eligibility  criteria.  3. Provide experienced evaluators who can advise studies in best practices for diagnostic assessment and  standardized measure selection, provide training in administration of standardized measures, establish initial  reliability and ongoing monitoring of administration fidelity, and conduct specialized diagnostic assessments as  needed."
"9350154","Project Title: Effect of Alcohol Use on Waterpipe Smoking Patterns and Toxicant Exposure Project Summary/ Abstract: Waterpipe (WP) smoking in the US is on the rise and beginning to overtake cigarettes as the most popular method of tobacco use among young adults. Unfortunately, WP smoking is associated with many of the same negative health outcomes as cigarettes such as cancer, lung disease, respiratory illness, and cardiovascular disease. The co-occurrence of alcohol use and WP smoking is quite common among young adults. Relative to those who do not use WP, WP smokers are estimated to be more than twice as likely to use alcohol and frequently consume alcohol immediately before or during a WP smoking session. Of concern, the cigarette smoking literature suggests that smokers smoke more cigarettes when they drink alcohol and have a more difficult time abstaining from smoking, resulting in more exposure to nicotine and tobacco-related toxicants. These findings cannot be directly applied to WP smoking due to unique aspects of WP smoking (e.g., smoking patterns, smoke may be easier to inhale, WP is typically smoked in groups). To date, no study has experimentally and systematically investigated the impact of alcohol on WP smoking behaviors, resultant exposure to tobacco-related toxicants, or abuse liability. The proposed study will provide this needed scientific evidence. Using a randomized crossover-design, 40 current WP smokers will complete two counterbalanced WP smoking sessions (alcohol vs. placebo) that are preceded by 24 hours of alcohol abstinence and 12-hour tobacco abstinence. Sessions will be separated by a standard 48-hour washout period, and WP tobacco nicotine levels will be held constant across sessions. Measures of smoking behavior (puff topography) and acute toxicant exposure (CO boost and plasma nicotine) will be collected, in addition to self-report measures of abuse liability, intentions for continued use, and importance of concurrent alcohol consumption for using WP. If alcohol consumption were determined to influence users to initially try WP, increase their willingness to continue to use the product, and/or make it more palatable to puff more frequently or take longer/deeper puffs, then concurrent alcohol use would be contributing to the initiation and maintenance of WP dependence. This innovative study, in its systematic examination of the impact of co-use of alcohol and WP, will provide the scientific foundation needed to establish effective regulatory strategies for the distribution and sales of WP tobacco and alcohol. In addition, this project will serve as an incredibly valuable training experience by providing an opportunity to learn new assessments of WP smoking and drug-drug interactions while learning from leading experts in the field of WP smoking and gaining an appreciation for interdisciplinary collaboration."
"9353779","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The proposed research is to study radiant pressure effects of ultrasound on living tissues using animal models for cancer therapeutics. A major limitation of prior work regarding therapeutic effects of radiant pressure on cancer has been either too low acoustic intensity (in case of unfocused ultrasound produced with conventional transducers used for imaging) or too high acoustic intensity (in case of high-intensity focused ultrasound used to ablate tissue with thermal effects). Here, a novel Self-Focusing Acoustic Transducer (SFAT) capable of electrically varying the focal length and intensity will be used to deliver direct radiant pressure forces to living tissues, in the absence of thermal energy deposition or wide-spread cavitation formation, to preferentially kill cancer cells without damaging adjacent normal cells or tissue.  Many studies have demonstrated that cancer cells are significantly more deformable (?less stiff?) than non-malignant counterparts. Our preliminary studies show that a focused acoustic beam within a specific energy range preferentially kills melanoma, prostate, and other cancer cells compared with non-tumorogenic matched cell lines. Further, our data supports that this is a direct result of fundamental differences in cytoskeletal architecture specific to malignant transformation. Thus, we propose studies to assess radiant pressure effects of highly focused US on normal and malignant tissue (as subcutaneous tumors and xenografts) in vivo.  Since SFATs delivers the intended acoustic intensity only on its focal spot, it can produce unique effects at a local point without affecting other regions. Moreover, it is also capable of delivering acoustic energy through an intermediate solid or liquid, and is very well suited for non-invasive tumor treatment. Thus, the transducer and the scientific findings encountered on the way to its development will serve as a transformative technology broadly applicable for treatment of skin cancer and other malignancies."

Ca oxalate (CaOx) stones associate with plaque, apatite (AP) stones with DP. Decreased renal Ca reabsorption (rCa) is characteristic of idiopathic hypercalciuria (IH); how decreased rCa promotes plaque and DP, as well as stones, is a theme of the PPG. In Project 2 a papillary grading scale (PGS) will be used to quantify plaque and DP during endoscopic stone surgery, and to select ICSF with IH as subjects for Projects 1 and 3, so that physiology (Project 1) and tissue studies (Project 3) will be done on similar ICSF, chosen for high scores for either plaque or DP. The ability of the PGS to correlate with clinical and histopathologic features of stone formation, and with risk of stone recurrence will be tested in aims 2.1 and 2.5. Whether papillary appearance in pediatric stone formers is similar to adults will be tested in aim 2.2. Aims 1.1a and 3.1a-b will test whether plaque is caused by decreased rCa in proximal tubule. Animal models suggest that inflammatory mediators or reactive oxygen species play a role in stone formation, and we will test this in urine (aim 1.3) and tissue (3.2.1a-c, 3.2.2, 3.3a-b) of ICSF with plaque or DP. Whether DP can propagate via an inflammatory field effect will be tested in aim 3.3c. We predict DP will associate with Ca phosphate supersaturation in urine (aim 1.1b), with presence of AP in stones (aim 2.3), and with renal impairment (aim 2.4). The possibility that DP-induced inflammation causes pain will be explored in aim 2.6. We will compare the effects of 2 common stone treatments, low Na diet with or without Kcitrate, on segmental rCa in controls and ICSF, using endogenous lithium clearance and urine exosomal markers to study effects on both proximal (aim 1.2) and distal (aim 1.4) nephron rCa, as well as effects on overnight urine Ca (aim 1.5), and on urine SS and upper limit of metastability (aim 1.6)."
"9537135","PROJECT SUMMARY  The long-term goal of this study is to develop new strategies to mitigate and protect radiation-induced hematopoietic injury by delineating the molecular mechanisms responsible for enhancing hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) self-renewal and survival. Radiation therapy commonly results in not only acute hematopoietic suppression but also long-term bone marrow (BM) injury. To date, no effective treatment has been developed to prevent or treat these pathological consequences. Enhancing HSC survival and maintaining their genomic integrity upon radiation are crucial for preservation of HSC self-renewal function and for protection against radiation-induced BM injury. However, the molecular mechanisms for regulating HSC survival and self-renewal are not well defined. HSC number and function demonstrate natural variations, and underlying genetic diversity is an important, yet largely unknown, mechanism involved in the regulation of HSC function. Latexin (Lxn) was previously identified as the first stem cell regulatory gene whose natural variation negatively contributes to the HSC population size in different mouse strains. In preliminary studies, constitutive gene ablation approaches were developed to define the role of Lxn in HSCs and hematopoiesis in normal and radiation stress conditions. Results showed that Lxn inactivation protects HSCs and hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) from radiation- induced cell death, thus mitigating acute hematopoietic suppression and conferring a survival advantage. Moreover, Lxn knockout mice do not develop hematological malignancies following single or fractionated dosages of radiation. Mechanistically, Lxn inactivation in vivo increases HSC self-renewal and survival. At the molecular level, our published and preliminary work showed that ribosomal protein subunit 3 (Rps3) is a novel Lxn-binding protein, and Lxn overexpression inhibits Rps3 activity, thus enhancing radiation sensitivity and toxicity. In addition, the number of human HSCs/HPCs negatively correlates with Lxn expression level, indicating the potential role of Lxn in regulating human hematopoiesis. These findings lead to the hypothesis that Lxn maintains homeostatic HSC and hematopoiesis and inhibition of Lxn function protects against radiation-induced hematopoietic injury via Rps3-dependent prosurvival pathways. Specific aims are to: 1) determine the cellular mechanisms by which Lxn inactivation enhances HSC survival and self-renewal and confers radioprotection, 2) identify the molecular mechanisms by which Lxn inactivation enhances Lxn-Rps3- NF-kB prosurvival pathway, and 3) determine the role of Lxn in mitigating human hematopoietic cell toxicity from radiation injury. This research will advance understanding of a critical but understudied mechanism involved in the natural regulator of HSC function and self-renewal. By using mouse and human model systems and state-of-the-art molecular and genomic techniques, findings from the proposed study may facilitate to the development of novel mechanism-based therapeutic strategy to protect against radiation-induced BM injury, which could be beneficial for the patients receiving cancer therapy and BM transplantation.      "
"9348063","Project Summary Atopic dermatitis/AD (atopic eczema) is a chronic, inflammatory disease resulting in itchy, inflamed, swollen skin that is easily susceptible to infection. It is estimated by the National Eczema association that there are currently 31.6 million people affected, and at least 17.8 million of them have moderate to severe disease. The current standard of care largely comprises of a multipronged approach involving skin care, elimination of allergic triggers and immune-suppressive strategies including the use of steroids, antihistamines, or topical immunommodulators (TIMs). While these therapies can help partly manage the disease, undesirable side effects are seen upon chronic usage. Thus, given the significant public health burden imposed on the society and the lack of effective treatments, there is an unmet need for novel targeted therapeutics that can help manage symptoms and improve the quality of life for AD patients Fannin Partners, LLC is an early-stage life sciences development group focused on commercializing innovation developed in the Texas Medical Center institutions. Led by an experienced team of managers with diverse business backgrounds, commercialization experience, and strong entrepreneurial knowhow, Fannin Partners works with promising life science innovators to help develop and commercialize promising therapeutic technologies for clinical adoption. The basic research conducted by Drs. John McMurray and David Corry directly led to this innovation. Our lead molecule, PM-43I, is a small-molecule, cell-permeable, and phosphatase-stable phosphopeptide mimetic that targets the SH2 domain of STAT6 and prevents recruitment to IL-4R? and the subsequent transcriptional activity leading to the atopic dermatitis phenotype. The focus of this proposal is to accomplish key milestones that will transition this technology for commercialization for the atopic dermatitis market by conducting in vitro and in vivo proof of concept study. The project is organized into two measureable Specific Aims: 1. Characterization of STAT6 phosphorylation and skin barrier gene expression in human keratinocytes in the presence of PM-43I. Keratinocytes play a critical role in AD pathogenesis. They show upregulated STAT6 phosphorylation upon IL- 4 and IL-13 stimulation. Phosphorylated STAT6 then down-regulates the level of loricrin and ivolucrin, two proteins important for skin barrier formation and integrity. Our previous studies in asthma have demonstrated that PM-43I is able to reduce STAT6 phosphorylation in lung epithelial cells (data not shown), here we are going to test if PM-43I also reduces STAT6 phosphorylation in keratinocytes, and subsequent down-regulation of LOR and IVL expression. 2. To study the efficacy of PM-43I in atopic dermatitis management. Specific Aim 2A: To determine PM-43I formulation for animal study. (2 months) This aim is going to determine the best-performing topical formulation for PM-43I in treating atopic dermatitis for the following efficacy study in mouse models. Drug solubility, stability, and in vitro skin permeation will be studied. Specific Aim 2B: To study the efficacy of PM43I in atopic dermatitis animal models (7 months) With the formulation obtained from Aim 2A, we will employ atopic dermatitis mouse model to study the efficacy of PM-43I in this aim. AD clinical score will be used to evaluate the symptoms of mice with or without PM-43I treatment. In addition, histology, serum cytokines and IgE level, and STAT6 phosphorylation and skin barrier gene expression in keratinocytes will be examined. These studies will help to prove the function of PM-43I in atopic dermatitis on both the symptomatic and molecular level."
"9384304","ABSTRACT Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is consistently related to impaired attention and behavioral and physiological self-regulation in infants and young children, suggesting persistent negative impact on skills essential for optimal learning and social competence. Gestational exposure to cocaine occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, which is immediately followed by massive expansion and refinement of brain structure, functional connections and network organization in the first year of life. However, little is known about the effects of PCE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits in cognition and neurobehavior. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of PCE on the developmental trajectory of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 0-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how specific maternal caregiving characteristics (Sensitivity, Harshness) moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by PCE; deficits in developing functional connections mediate the negative effects of PCE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; postnatal maternal behaviors and environment interact with PCE to influence growth trajectories of developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the Co-PIs'strong preliminary data describing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in functional connectivity due to prenatal cocaine and other drugs in neonates (Grewen, Gao), and on Co-investigator Eiden's longitudinal studies of the behavioral effects of PCE and its moderation by maternal behaviors in infants, toddlers and children. We propose to study infant resting state functional connectivity and behavioral development at 2 weeks, 6 months and 12 months in 3 groups of infants: 120 with PCE with or without exposure to other drugs (nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, and/or opiates), 100 exposed to the same other drugs but without cocaine (OD), 100 drug-free (CTL). We will measure Maternal Sensitivity (primary), Maternal Harshness (secondary) and an index of cumulative environmental risk to determine postnatal moderation of PCE effects on developing connectivity. The rationale is that longitudinal study will reveal prenatal drug effects, determine whether the postnatal trajectory of brain functional connections is merely delayed or permanently altered by initial PCE insult, and ascertain postnatal factors contributing to greater risk or resilience in func- tional network development. This innovative approach will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural deficit and postnatal environmental influences on patterns of brain and cognitive development, and will apply hypothesis-driven and data-driven analytic methods, including machine learning, to characterize mechanisms underlying PCE effects on trajectory of brain development. Knowledge gleaned has potential to inform earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce learning and behavioral impairments in this at-risk population."
"9373095","PROJECT SUMMARY This R03 proposal stems directly from studies and career development activities outlined in my current K01 award and represents a new research direction that will enhance my advancement towards independence. This award will allow me to obtain additional skills in combining genetic mouse models of disease with systems biology approaches in order to define novel mechanisms of autophagy regulation in the intestine and colon with direct relevance to Inflammatory Bowel Disease and colorectal cancer. This will be achieved with the guidance of my research mentor, Dr. Rustgi, my K01 interdisciplinary advisory committee of Drs. Wu (Chair), Kaestner, Lengner, and Lynch, as well as new collaborator Dr. Premal Shah. Autophagy is a mechanism by which cells adapt and survive in response to stress under certain conditions. During homeostasis, autophagy can be protective in the intestinal epithelium following acute injury, which is underscored by recent studies describing defective autophagy in Crohn's disease patients. Post-transcriptional regulation of intestinal epithelial homeostasis via RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), including IMP1 (IGF2 mRNA- binding protein 1=IMP1), represents a critical, acute layer of gene expression control through modulation of target transcript splicing, stability, localization and translation. Our preliminary data demonstrate phenotypic and functional alterations in the autophagy pathway in mice with intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific deletion of Imp1 (Imp1?IEC), where autophagic flux is enhanced during homeostasis. Imp1?IEC mice exhibit enhanced regeneration following injury, which can be reversed with autophagy inhibition. RNP-immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays have unraveled specific autophagy transcripts bound by IMP1, previously unknown. These data support the scientific premise that IMP1 may normally suppress intestinal epithelial autophagy via direct biochemical binding. Despite these functional links between IMP1 and autophagy, it remains unknown whether high IMP1 expression directly downregulates autophagy and whether this could contribute to disease phenotypes in Crohn's patients. We will therefore test the hypothesis that intestinal epithelial IMP1 functions to suppress autophagy directly and promote susceptibility to inflammation-induced injury. Specifically, we will utilize our newly generated mouse model in which Imp1 is conditionally overexpressed in the intestine and colon epithelium (Imp1OE, OE=overexpression) combined with targeted and unbiased approaches (RNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling) to dissect the direct mechanism of autophagy regulation by IMP1. The long-term objective of these studies (to be achieved through future NIH R01 funding) is to understand fundamental intestinal epithelial biology via regulation of RNA-binding proteins and evaluate IMP1 as a new therapeutic target for enhancing autophagy in patients with defective autophagy (including Crohn's disease)."
"9311503","Every year over 300,000 women die from pregnancy complications, and over 6.5 million more suffer complications that result in life-long disability, for which $41 billion is spent on healthcare costs. However, little is known about the development and differentiation of the cells?extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs)?at the heart of most human pregnancy complications. Our overarching goal is to develop mechanism-based strategies to prevent, diagnose, and treat pregnancy complications associated with faulty trophoblast development. We have strong evidence that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) acts directly on trophoblast stem cells and plays a key role in the differentiation of junctional zone cells and specific subtypes of trophoblast giant cells (TGCs) in mice, which are orthologous to EVTs in humans. We discovered that different levels of decidual VEGF overexpression at the implantation site stimulates placental production of the potent endogenous VEGF antagonist soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt1) and induces a spectrum of symptoms in mice similar to those of human obstetrical diseases, from preeclampsia to abruptio placentae. Our preliminary data show that specific symptoms of each of those diseases are associated with abnormal development of a subset of TGCs and junctional zone cells. Thus, we hypothesize that the level of VEGF overexpression during early placental development corresponds to abnormal development of specific subtypes of TGCs associated with distinct pregnancy complications and that the diseases associated with excess sFlt1 production can be treated by reducing sFlt1 only at later stages of pregnancy. We also hypothesize that different EVT subtypes exist and that excess VEGF can cause disproportionate expansion of specific EVT subtypes in humans. Thus, our experiments will define the role of VEGF in the development of specific trophoblast subtypes (Aim 1), how levels of VEGF affect these cells at each stage of placental development in vivo in the mouse, how these cellular defects are related to specific pregnancy outcomes (Aim 2), and where and when VEGF signaling pathways can be targeted for prevention and therapeutic strategies (Aim 2). Several novel techniques will be used to address these questions, including inducible placenta- and decidua-specific gene expression systems for precise control of gene expression at discrete stages of pregnancy, and nanoparticle-mediated delivery of morpholinos to specific cells in the placenta. Finally, our preliminary data suggest that analogous EVTs may be present at similar locations in the human placenta as TGCs in mice and that VEGF may play a similar role in human trophoblast differentiation. We will characterize the diversity of EVTs in human placenta using laser microdissection, global transcriptional profiling, and a culture model of human chorionic trophoblast progenitor cell differentiation (Aim 3). These studies will characterize the previously unappreciated relationship between excess VEGF signaling and faulty trophoblast differentiation and the resulting spectrum of pregnancy disorders and provide specific guidance for the development of diagnostics and targeted therapies for these disorders."
"9329365","Project Abstract: Acute HIV infection (AHI) is a crucially important, although currently neglected topic in public health, medical, and research ethics. Defined as the first few weeks or months following viral acquisition, AHI is a time of sharply heightened infectiousness, during which diagnosed patients must navigate difficult life decisions related to their physical and psychological well-being, as well as that of their partners and families. For many, this is a tumultuous period marked by incapacitating illness (acute retroviral syndrome), substance abuse, depression, guilt, anger, blame, and uncertainty. However, despite being a period of heightened vulnerability, AHI remains a key time-point at which interventions to prevent HIV transmission might be most effective, especially within hard to reach communities. In addition to HIV prevention, individuals diagnosed so early are of increasing interest to HIV researchers working to improve treatment or to find a cure. Currently, one of the greatest challenges to curing HIV is the persistence of latent viral reservoirs within the body. Individuals diagnosed and virally suppressed during AHI are generally provided long-term immunological benefits and tend to have smaller viral reservoirs. AHI diagnosed and treated patients may therefore be among the first to be eventually cured of HIV. For now, they represent a rare and valuable research population for studies seeking to prevent, eradicate, or permanently suppress HIV reservoirs. However, despite AHI's widely recognized scientific importance, to date few efforts have been made to understand what it like to live through AHI, or how these individuals experience clinical research participation. Understanding how acutely infected individuals' experiences affect clinical research participation, as well as how their experiences might differ from other research participants living with chronic HIV infection, is therefore essential to improving recruitment, consent, and retention practices among AHI diagnosed individuals as well as to ensuring the responsible conduct of research with similarly vulnerable research populations. This grant proposes to apply an innovative, ethnographic approach to clinical research in order to gain a deeper, nuanced understanding of AHI and its ethical dimensions. This project logically extends from our NIAID R01 (1R01A108366-01) study focused on the more general social and ethical implications of curing HIV. The goal of this study is to inform and enhance ethical conduct with this vulnerable research population. To this end, we propose three specific aims: (1) Examine the experiences of acutely infected research participants involved in HIV treatment and cure-related studies using anthropological methods; (2) Compare perceptions of risks and benefits of clinical HIV trial participation between acutely and chronically infected HIV research subjects; (3) Develop a set of ethical recommendations that address specific challenges related to identifying, recruiting, and retaining AHI individuals in HIV clinical (especially cure) research. Previously developed strong working relationships with local UNC and Duke acute HIV clinical research teams greatly increase our likelihood of success."

Our specific aims are:  Aim 1: To refine and integrate a novel approach to the electronic collection and use of PRO data from RA  patients to facilitate better patient-provider communication, and achievement of Treat to Target (T2T) goals.  We will further pilot-test novel and recently-completed technologies developed by our research team: 1) the  RhEumatoid Arthritis Disease activitY (READY) electronic measurement tool that will collect data from  patients using multiple existing, validated PRO instruments at physician offices and patients' homes via the  Internet and smari:phones (e.g. iPhone); 2) a risk communication tool focused on optimal use of biologic  agents for RA patients considering changes in therapy; and 3) linked EHR-based data available through the  ACR's new national registry, the Rheumatology Informatics System for Effectiveness (RISE). With critical  input from many key stakeholders, including patients, we will refine this integrated tool in a variety of clinical  practices using commonly available computing devices (e.g. iPad) to create a highly generalizable resource  that can be deployed across both community and academic practice settings nationally.  Aim 2: To conduct a cluster-randomized study to examine the effect of the integrated electronic tool to  optimize RA patient care. We will test the hypothesis that RA patients receiving care in the physician  practices randomized to receive the intervention tool will attain better RA outcomes as quantified by the  proportion of patients in each physicians' practice that have achieved a T2T goal of low disease activity or  remission one year after randomization."
"9279621","Project Summary Abstract: Our capability to apply high-throughput molecular profiling technologies to increasingly large cohorts and sample sets is significantly expanding our understanding of human biology and complex disease. The Genotype Tissue-Expression (GTEx) project is creating a unique resource of genetic variation and gene expression across a wide range of human tissues. Upon completion this will include RNA sequence data from over 25,000 samples spanning 53 human tissues/organs and whole genome and exome sequence data from 960 donors. Additional data types not yet generated will include miRNA-seq, protein levels, DNA methylation, ChIP-seq, and DNase I hypersensitive site data among others. The ability to easily access, interpret and integrate these large data sets by a wide range of users with varying needs and skills is becoming of critical importance to leverage the full utility of the data. The GTEx Portal (http://gtexportal.org/) is the most widely accessed resource for the GTEx project, hosting all unprotected data, analysis results and numerous visual exploration tools, and has been enthusiastically received by the scientific community. To maximize the impact of this resource, we plan to expand the portal to: host data currently in production and new data types still to be generated; present novel and integrative analyses of existing data, and data from external sources; and to develop and share flexible tools for data analysis, visualization and access. Aim 1. We will host and support all open-access GTEx data and analysis results, performing systematic re-analyses of the data with new methods to reflect the state-of-the-art in RNA-seq analysis. We will add all new data sets to the portal to include novel assays (e.g. mi-RNA-seq, protein, methylation assays, etc/), derived analysis results (e.g. trans-eQTLs, splice- QTLs, GWAS enrichment analyses, protein-QTLs, etc.), and RNA-seq data sets from external investigators. Aim 2. We will work closely with both small focus groups of tool developers and engage our large user-base to identify and prioritize new features for development to display and integrate between multiple data types, and collaborate with other large genomic resources (e.g. ENCODE, UCSC and ENSEMBL browsers) to enable better integration of data sources and to enhance the utility and accessibility of the GTEx resource. Aim 3. We will automate and share all analysis pipeline tools with the scientific community. To support a wide range of user access needs, we will develop an open-source API to provide comprehensive data access, and also improve visualization tools and user-driven data analyses on the portal. To maximize use of the resource, we will design and offer training videos and outreach workshops.  "

Members of Core 2 will assume (and has assumed) major responsibilities for methodological, statistical, and computer-related issues, including study design for all projects; data collection, data entry, and analyses; quality control; computer networking; database management; statistical methodology development; and participation in manuscript preparation. Core 2 has worked with each Project Leader to insure that each study design is adequate to address all major hypotheses. This has involved refining study hypotheses, defining primary (and when necessary, secondary) end points for each study; determining the sample sizes necessary to test each hypothesis with a specified power and level of significance, and assessing the feasibility of each study relative to its hypothesis and the projected available subject pool. Core 2 has taken care to design the statistical analysis plans for each project to contain a combination of standard and advanced statistical methods as needed. This includes using methods for longitudinal data that account for repeated measures as well as handling missing data if it were to occur. In addition, Core 2 members will look for opportunities to develop new statistical methods for analyzing imaging data and these approaches are described in the proposal. To guarantee that successful implementation of these methods occurs, Core 2 members are committed to taking an active part in the daily activities of each project. For each project one of Core 2 members will serve as a co-investigator and participate in regular meetings among investigators for that project. This model of collaboration among Core 2 members and scientific investigators has been implemented within the Cancer Center at Wake Forest University for many years with great success. In conclusion, the Biostatistics Core is an integral component of this P01. It connects the four projects together and supports all other Cores by providing centralized analytic and data management support that will allow efficient dissemination of results to flow among projects and cores, and into the scientific community."
"9280421","SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (PROJECT 2) Immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment of a variety of advanced malignancies. Anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor redirected T cells (CART-19) have been particularly successful in B-cell malignancies. How to translate the success of CART cell therapy to other malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains an important question in the field. A critical requirement of CART cell therapy is that the target tissue be expendable. AML is a malignancy of the hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) and shares cell surface antigens with normal HSPC and with normal myeloid progeny such as neutrophils and monocytes. It has become clear that the lack of AML-specific antigens is the single biggest impediment to unleashing the power of CART cells against AML and other myeloid malignancies. The long-term goal of this project is to develop a clinically feasible CART cell platform for AML, by creating AML-specific CART cells that are able to expand and persist in vivo to eradicate AML while preserving normal marrow function. The central hypothesis is that a durable anti-leukemic effect from anti-CD33 CART cells can co-exist with adequate levels of genetically engineered CD33-deficient hematopoiesis. This will be accomplished in three specific aims. In Aim 1, high quality depletable anti-CD33 CAR T cells will be manufactured. These will be allogeneic, donor-derived T cells transduced with a biscistronic lentiviral vector that encodes a humanized anti-CD33-41BB-zeta CAR as well as CD20. In Aim 2, the feasibility and safety of manufacturing CD33-deficient human HSPC will be tested and regulatory approvals to manufacture CD33-deficient HSPC will be obtained. In Aim 3, a clinical trial will be conducted of a combined approach incorporating CD33-deficient, CAR-resistant allogeneic HCT followed by CART-33 infusion in patients with AML. This research will be significant because it will contribute depth (of clinical responses) and breadth (of eligibility for potentially curative therapy) to the therapeutic arsenal against AML. The innovation of the proposed research lies in replacing the search for suitable leukemia-specific antigens with a novel platform that combines pan-myeloid specific CART (such as CART-33) with an infusion of donor HSPC that are genetically engineered to lack CD33 and which are therefore resistant to killing by CART-33."
"9519301","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The major goal of this application is to maintain the Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) program at the Caribbean Primate Research Center's (CPRC) through support of operations, management, veterinary care, virological and MHC typing, and by the improvement of the comprehensive genetic management plan. A unique feature of the CPRC animals that had facilitated the successful establishment and improved sustainability of the SPF colony is that these animals are naturally free of SIV and SRV-D, two of the four viruses to be tested for(4). Undoubtedly, this trait has contributed to the establishment of a successful program with very limited number of sero-conversions. Nevertheless, for safety and as required for the SPF Program, The CPRC continues systematically testing for all four viruses (B virus, STLV, SIV and SRV-D). The Program provides unadmixed Indian-origin rhesus monkeys with defined genetic and virological background. The population genetic analyses revealed that the SPF colony has remained genetically homogenous over time with sufficient amounts of heterozygosity and minima stratification from its non- SPF founders. Genetic variation will be maintained in the SPF colony using the genetic management strategies described in this application. The genetic management approach will allow for enrichment of desired MHC markers in demand for biomedical research while maintaining genetic diversity. To ensure the long-term viability of the CPRC-SPF colony, the Center's approach for genetic management will be concordant with the NIH's National NHP Genetics and Genomics Working Group's guidelines. The estimate of Indian ancestry among the C P R C - S P F a n i m a l s is also among the highest that have been calculated across several National Primate Research Centers (NPRCs) in the US. Funds are requested in this application to maintain the SPF program and to meet the proposed aims. With continued NIH support, the Institutional contribution and with funds from the program income, the SPF program at CPRC will remain a significant national research resource and will be able to provide healthy SPF Indian- origin rhesus monkeys of defined genetic and virological background to NIH-sponsored research programs, specially HIV/AIDS studies."
"9383580","ABSTRACT  Pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ib (PHP1B), a rare imprinting disorder, is caused by loss-of- methylation at one or several differentially methylation regions (DMR) on the maternal GNAS allele thereby reducing expression of the simulatory G protein (G?s). Besides PTH-resistant hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia, additional clinical and laboratory abnormalities are being recognized with increasing frequency. Thus, considerable overlap has become apparent between PHP1B and PHP1A. In fact, we encountered several PHP1B patients, who were evaluated for hyperphagia leading to early- onset obesity many years before a GNAS-related disorder was considered and before PTH-resistance had developed. Autosomal dominant PHP1B (AD-PHP1B) is caused by deletions in GNAS or STX16, but the majority of these patients are sporadic and with the exception of few cases caused by paternal uniparental isodisomy/heterodisomy, the genetic defect(s) leading to this disease variant remains unknown. A novel maternally inherited GNAS deletion that is associated with broad methylation changes at this locus was recently discovered, althought the patient had no family history of the disease; this raises the possibility that other ?sporadic? PHP1B cases are also caused by as-yet undefined GNAS/STX16 mutations. Through whole genome sequencing (WGS), we furthermore identified a large GNAS inversion in a new AD-PHP1B kindred, which causes loss-of-methylation at GNAS exon A/B alone. When this inversion is located on the paternal allele, no functional XL?s (extra- large variants of G?s) can be generated, which is likely to lead to failure-to-thrive and short stature, i.e. findings similar to those observed in humans or rodents with XL?s-deficiency. We now plan to determine whether genetic and epigenetic GNAS changes are a frequent cause of early-onset obesity, congenital hypothyroidism, and potentially short stature, and whether these abnormalities can be encountered even in the absence of PTH-resistant hypocalcemia (Aim 1). To determine whether disease-causing mutations in GNAS/STX16 lead to epigenetic GNAS changes when introduced in vitro, we developed cell lines from the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of brown adipose tissue in which deletions were introduced through CRISPR/Cas9. We will determine whether these cellular manipulations change allele-specific GNAS methylation and/or parent-specific expression of G?s and its splice variants, and thus the response to hormonal stimulation (Aim 2). We will furthermore search in new AD-PHP1B families with GNAS methylation changes, but without mutations at known disease- causing sites, for novel GNAS/STX16 deletions/inversions, and we will determine through WGS, whether adult females with ?sporadic? PHP1B, who have healthy children without epigenetic GNAS changes, could be affected an autosomal recessive disease variant (Aim 3)."
"9390596","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: My career goal is to become an independent physician-scientist and national leader in geriatric critical care outcomes research whose body of work improves the long-term functional outcomes of critically ill older adults. My clinical training as a Pulmonary & Critical Care Medicine (PCCM) physician and research training in Geriatric Clinical Epidemiology have prepared me to pursue this career path. My track record of early success is evidenced by the publication of high-impact original reports and the receipt of 3 grants, including a GEMSSTAR award. I have already distinguished myself as a national leader in my specialty as well as in geriatrics: I founded and am co-chair of the American Thoracic Society Critical Care Assembly's Aging and Geriatrics Working Group, and was recently selected as an incoming co-chair of the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) Medical Subspecialties Section. My research efforts have been recognized nationally, with the AGS New Investigator Award, and at Yale, with the prestigious Iva Dostanic Physician-Scientist Award. Mentors and Environment: I have an exceptional team of mentors and advisors, including my primary mentor Dr. Thomas Gill (Geriatrics), a leading expert on the epidemiology and prevention of disability, co-mentor Dr. Margaret Pisani (PCCM), an expert in critical care outcomes research, and advisor Dr. Terrence Murphy, a biostatistician with expertise in longitudinal studies of aging and critical care outcomes research. My research and career development plans draw on the wealth of resources available at Yale, including the Yale Program on Aging/Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center, the Yale School of Public Health, and one of the largest intensive care units (ICUs) in the country at Yale-New Haven Hospital. These resources, and the support provided by the Section of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine at the Yale School of Medicine, provide an ideal environment for my career development and execution of the proposed research. Mentored Research Project: Nearly 1.4 million older adults survive an ICU stay each year, and many of these will suffer from increased disability. Our prior work has demonstrated that premorbid factors are strongly associated with the course of disability after a critical illness ? yet no mechanism exists to identify which older ICU patients are at risk of increased disability. To address this knowledge gap, I have proposed an innovative research project that leverages the wealth of resources available at Yale in addition to two high-quality longitudinal datasets: the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) and Precipitating Events Project (PEP). The overall objective is to develop, externally validate, and pilot test a predictive tool (that incorporates premorbid risk factors) to identify older ICU patients at risk of worsening post-ICU disability and provide a personal estimate of the increase in disability. The results will inform the design and conduct of a larger prospective cohort study to test the accuracy of the tool in predicting post-ICU disability as well as a subsequent clinical trial testing interventions to improve post-ICU functional outcomes among older adults."
"9350157","Project Summary Microglia are the resident immune cells of the central nervous system and emerging evidence suggests they are influential in shaping the developing brain. Microglia have been proposed to regulate proliferation, differentiation, and neuronal survival in various systems but these studies reveal variable, and often contradictory, functions. Utilizing the simplicity of the embryonic mammalian retina, we can directly assess the role of microglia in regulating neurogenesis. Currently, little is known about microglial function in the developing retina, despite the fact that they infiltrate the neural retina at the onset of neurogenesis and distribute throughout proliferating and newly forming differentiated layers. I have performed preliminary experiments addressing this, and the results suggest that microglia either 1) directly modulate retinal progenitor proliferation and differentiation, or 2) regulate the survival of newly born neurons. Therefore, I will differentiate between these two possibilities, and then identify the signaling pathways involved. Completion of this work will result in the first study of microglial function and phenotype in the developing mammalian retina, and will determine whether microglia are crucial for proper development of the retina. In addition, this proposal will expand on our current understanding of crosstalk between microglia and progenitors/neurons that will shed light on the complex role for these cells in cortical development, adult neurogenesis, and stem cell therapies."
"9407835","ABSTRACT Burn injury care has improved in the past decades, but complications still occur and lead to prolonged hospital stays and potentially to death. The risk of infection rises as a result of burns since the skin layers, which function as a barrier and prevent pathogens from accessing the susceptible body tissues, are no longer intact. Importantly, infections involving gram-negative or gram-positive pathogens are still the most common cause of mortality in burn injury patients. Although topical treatments exist, there is a need for an antiseptic that can effectively penetrate to the site of infection and that can be used for treatment of pathogens found in medical facilities. To address this need, CorMedix proposes to develop a combination of taurolidine encased in digestible nanosystems as topical treatment at burn sites. This proposed gel formulation will be administered to the skin surface and will penetrate through to the epidermal/dermal junction at which it will be digested by local tissue enzymes, releasing taurolidine, a taurine amino acid derivative with broad antibacterial action against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, mycobacteria and some clinically relevant fungi. CorMedix's proposed product will combine the proven antiseptic capabilities of taurolidine with effective delivery to the site of infection, allowing prevention and treatment of infections including those caused by pathogens that have already been found to be resistant to currently used antiseptics. CorMedix will develop this proposed product and demonstrate successful penetration of taurolidine to the site of infection through two Specific Aims. In Specific Aim #1, a gel formulation with taurolidine containing nanoparticles will be developed by (1) Selection of a buffer that facilitates taurolidine stability during the nanosystem manufacturing process; (2) Selection of material for nanosystem surface (3); Testing of nanosystem susceptibility to subcutaneous tissue enzymes; and (4) Selection of gel matrix for suspension of nanoparticles. In Specific Aim #2, the developed formulation will be tested in vitro using a Franz cells model."
"9358704","PROJECT ABSTRACT The effects of drinking alcohol within recommended limits on risks of CVD, diabetes, and related diseases are perhaps the most important questions yet to be answered in the fields of alcohol, nutrition, or prevention. Approximately half of all adults worldwide report current or former alcohol consumption, and the benefits or risks that alcohol poses to their health urgently need clarification. Epidemiological studies have consistently found that alcohol intake within recommended limits is associated with lower risk of coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and diabetes, yet no long-term randomized trial of alcohol consumption on risk of any chronic disease has yet been performed. In direct response to PAR-16-363 (Multi-Site Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial Research Center on Alcohol's Health Effects), we propose a worldwide, six-year, balanced-design randomized trial, comparing the effects of one standard serving (~14 grams) of alcohol intake daily to abstention on risk of CVD, diabetes, mortality, and related outcomes among 7,800 adults at above-average cardiovascular risk worldwide. To maximize feasibility and reflect actual use most closely, we propose to test alcohol consumption per se to abstention and thus to offer participants flexibility in their choice of beverage, while employing novel and intensive yet efficient methods to monitor safety. The Primary Specific Aim of this trial is to determine the effects of 14 gm of alcohol intake daily compared with abstention on risk of major cardiovascular events or death (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hospitalized angina, need for revascularization, or death) over an average of 6 years of follow-up among 7,800 adults aged ?50 years with estimated 10-year CVD risk ?15% or prevalent CVD >6 months prior to enrollment. Secondary Aims will test the effects of alcohol on risks of incident diabetes and major cardiovascular events. Tertiary Aims will test risks of hard cardiovascular events and progression to impaired fasting glucose. Similar to other large randomized trials, we will establish ~16 centers worldwide using a stepped approach, with a 9-month vanguard phase among 7 centers in the US, Europe, Africa, and South America (in this application), followed by a second wave of additional sites to complete enrollment. Participants will be monitored for safety in multiple complementary ways, including brief electronic real-time reporting and validated yearly instruments and laboratory measures. We have brought together highly successful groups in the US and Europe to establish clinical, data, and biospecimen coordinating centers, our field centers include many of the most experienced clinical trialists anywhere, and our group has strong working relationships with NIAAA and other NIH staff necessary to ensure seamless collaboration during a U10-funded cooperative research endeavor. In this application, we propose the first randomized clinical trial of alcohol consumption, aiming to determine whether it increases or decreases the risk of CVD and diabetes among adults at above-average cardiovascular risk worldwide."
"9371185","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The goal of this K23 award is to provide Dr. Tae Woo Park, an addiction psychiatrist and Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at Boston University School of Medicine, with the necessary training to establish himself as an independent clinical investigator in the field of reducing the risks of prescription drug misuse. This K23 award focuses on developing and evaluating a distress tolerance (DT)-based treatment for benzodiazepine (BZD) discontinuation in patients receiving opioid agonist therapies (OAT). Assisting Dr. Park will be a local team of multidisciplinary experts in substance use disorder (SUD) research. Dr. Park's primary mentor, Dr. Richard Saitz is an addiction medicine physician and expert in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving combined psychosocial and pharmacological interventions for SUD patients. Co-mentors are Dr. Michael Otto, a clinical psychologist and expert in BZD discontinuation and DT-based psychosocial intervention development, Dr. Mari-Lynn Drainoni, an expert in using mixed methods in SUD research, Dr. Howard Cabral, a statistician and expert in RCT data and mediation analyses, and Dr. Jeffrey Samet, an addiction medicine physician-scientist with extensive mentoring experience. Dr. Park's training goals will involve 1) developing expertise in intervention development including qualitative research methods, 2) training in RCT methodology with SUD populations, 3) learning new methods in statistical analyses, and 4) enhancing research career skills including manuscript writing and gaining skills in grantsmanship.  BZD use is common in OAT patients and associated with overdose death and reduced OAT treatment retention. Dr. Park's research plan proposes to develop and evaluate a DT-based intervention to assist OAT patients with BZD discontinuation. The plan involves three phases. In Phase 1 (years 1 and 2), we will use qualitative methods to ascertain patients' (n=30) and clinicians' (n=10) intervention preferences with semi- structured qualitative interviews in order to develop a prototype manual for a 12-week Distress Tolerance treatment for BZD Discontinuation (DT-BD) and for a Health Education control condition (HE). In Phase 2 (year 2), we will pilot these interventions in 10 participants receiving OAT who are regularly using BZDs and use data from post-intervention interviews to refine the conditions. In Phase 3 (years 3-5), we will test the DT-BD intervention in a preliminary RCT of 50 additional participants. Participants will be randomized to DT-BD + a BZD taper (n = 25) or the BZD taper + HE (n = 25). Assessments will occur at baseline, weekly during the 12- week treatment, and at 1- and 3-month post-discontinuation follow-ups. The primary outcome will be successful BZD discontinuation determined by self-report confirmed by urine testing. Secondary outcomes are change in BZD use by self-report and change in DT by self-report and behavioral DT measures. We will explore potential mechanisms that may explain the efficacy of the DT intervention. The results of this study will be used to refine the DT-BD intervention so that it can be tested in a larger trial as part of an R01 application."
"9461362","?    DESCRIPTION:  This is a competing renewal application for the New England Consortium Node (NECN), led by Kathleen Carroll, Ph.D., of Yale and Roger Weiss, M.D., of Harvard. The NECN has a track record of outstanding productivity in the Clinical Trials Network (CTN), with leadership of 4 highly successful trials, high levels of study participation, excellent recruitment and retention, and 64 peer-reviewed publications from CTN trial data during the current funding period. NECN investigators have first-authored all 3 of the most highly-cited CTN publications and all 4 CTN publications cited most often per year.  The overarching goal of the NECN is to develop effective and sustainable interventions for substance use disorders that can be delivered in multiple healthcare settings, addressing substance use in all its diversity. Achieving this goal will entail 1) building on single-site efficacy trials to conduct multi-site effectivenes studies of promising interventions; 2) improving interventions with promising but modest results to date; and 3) developing innovative approaches for prevalent problems with no clearly established standard of care, or with suboptimal results in early studies (e.g., screening and brief intervention for drug use in primary care).  To address these goals, the NECN has added 1) local, regional, and national hospital-based and primary care networks that cover millions of individuals, and 2) investigators from 7 New England universities who have conducted seminal work in addiction medicine and innovative technology (Drs. Fiellin, Higgins, Marsch, O'Connor, Saitz, Samet). The NECN research agenda demonstrates its capacity to develop and implement novel approaches to improve treatment for substance users wherever they contact the healthcare system.  Proposed studies build on the previous work of NECN investigators and include, among others: 1. Screening and brief intervention (SBI) vs. repeated BIs vs. computer-based cognitive-behavioral therapy  for risky drug use in primary care (Saitz, Carroll); 2. Financial incentives for pregnant smokers in obstetrical practice (Higgins); 3. Buprenorphine initiation in the emergency department vs. facilitated referral for opioid dependent patients  (Fiellin, D'Onofrio); and 4. Use of peer navigators to enhance treatment retention among opioid dependent patients started on buprenorphine during hospitalization (Liebschutz, Stein)."
"9401068","Hypertension (HTN) affects ~ 30% of adult Americans and is a major risk factor for cardiovascular and renal diseases. Its pathogenesis is complex, with contributions from both genetic and environmental factors. The renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) is a key biological system that regulates arterial pressure (AP). Its major effector molecule is angiotensin II (Ang II) which mediates opposing effects through the signaling of its receptors, AT1R and AT2R. We have identified a transmembrane glycoprotein, collectrin (Tmem27 on chromosome X), a key regulator of AP and modulator of the bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide (O2?_), as a downstream target of Ang II. We published that collectrin is a critical chaperone for the reabsorption of all amino acids (AAs) in the proximal tubules (PT), and for the uptake of the cationic AA L- arginine (L-Arg) in endothelial cells (ECs). We reported that global collectrin knockout (Tmem27Y/-) mice have baseline HTN that is ameliorated by supplementation with L-Arg (a substrate for NO production). Furthermore, they have augmented salt-sensitive hypertension (SSH) that is corrected by TEMPOL, a superoxide dismutase mimetic. Tmem27Y/- mice have impaired cellular L-Arg uptake that is associated with decreased dimerization of endothelial and neuronal NO synthase (eNOS and nNOS, respectively) in renal tissues. These observations, along with their preferential production of O2?_ over NO, suggest that Tmem27Y/- mice have a state of NOS uncoupling. Collectrin is highly expressed in the kidney in the PT, collecting duct (CD), and throughout the vascular endothelium. In a manuscript in press, we show through kidney cross-transplantation (XTP) studies that collectrin in the kidney ameliorates SSH. Importantly, renal expression of collectrin is decreased by Ang II in an AT1R dependent manner, and is independent of hypertension per se. In preliminary data, we found significant association of human TMEM27 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with diastolic BP (DBP) in the HyperGEN study. We hypothesize that collectrin is downregulated by Ang II through AT1 receptor signaling, and is a molecular mechanism linking Ang II, NOS uncoupling, and HTN. Accordingly, our objective is to precisely delineate the renal tissue-collectrin-NOS axis through which collectrin regulates AP homeostasis and salt sensitivity; and to determine its influence on AP in human populations that include salt- sensitive (SS)/-resistant (SR) cohorts. We will comprehensively use in vivo and population genetic approaches to: 1A) To test the hypothesis that collectrin is downregulated by AT1 receptor signaling and upregulated through AT2 receptor signaling, and 1B) To test the hypothesis that collectrin in the PT and/or CD maintains NO and O2?_ balance to control sodium balance and therefore AP; 2) To test the hypothesis that deletion of endothelial collectrin decreases renal blood flow, and increases peripheral vascular resistance, AP and SSH; and 3) Determine the association of human TMEM27 gene variants with blood pressure in population based studies and in well characterized salt-sensitive and salt-resistant subjects."
"9321936","The translation of hypothesis-driven basic research into clinically useful tests and therapies for patients is challenging, particularly for individuals with rare diseases, because of limited numbers of patients who are geographically widely distributed throughout the US and the world, physicians who rarely see more than one or two patients with rare diseases and have limited training in basic science research and clinical research, and basic science researchers have limited access to patient samples and clinical data. Additionally, the early development of methods and techniques to understand the disease pathogenesis, evaluate potential therapeutic targets, and advance clinical techniques to improve outcome measures for patients are not well-funded by traditional grant mechanisms available to academic medicine. Pilot/demonstration programs are the ideal opportunity to integrate patients and patient foundations, physicians, and scientists to make scientific advancements for individuals with rare diseases. Research in the rare lung diseases, Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) and Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis (PAP), has significantly benefitted from pilot program opportunities at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), University of Cincinnati Medical Center (UCMC) and previously via the creation of the Rare Lung Disease Consortium (RLDC), part of the Rare Disease Clinical Research Network from 2003 through 2008. The new RLDC Pilot Program plans to build on these successes with LAM and PAP to continue to fund pilot/demonstration projects in LAM and PAP, as well as fund studies in Familial Interstitial Pneumonia (FIP), Pulmonary Alveolar Microlithiasis (PAM), Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (HPS), Alpha-1 anti-trypsin deficiency (A1AT) and additional rare lung diseases. We have solicited pilot proposals in the areas of FIP, PAM, PAP, that propose to perform a cross-sectional study of TERT mutation carriers in a cohort of patients with PIP, proof of concept treatment study with Etidronate for PAM, and a quantitative CT densitometry study to evaluate therapeutic efficacy for PAP. Additional preliminary concept are also included as potential projects for future years."
"9319281","Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): K h a c h i k i a n , C r i s t S i m o n PROJECT SUMMARY (See instmctions): Establishing a sustainable and CRT-informed overall research environment that more strongly motivates and prepares students for research careers and reduces the leakages that occur is an essential aim in our work to help students to successfully navigate these transition points. Faculty mentoring and research activities can directly influence URM student interest and engagement in health and health disparities research and research careers. Extensive faculty development strategies at CSUN and at our diverse Pipeline Partner institutions will better enable faculty to develop their own research programs and NIH proposals that can engage student researchers, with a rigorous mentor training program ensuring a more culturally competent mentoring approach informed by best practices. Within BUlLD(gCSUN laboratories, students and faculty members will engage in their ongoing research in a cooperative social environment rather than a competitive one - less hierarchical and more inclusive of input from all members of the laboratory and with attention paid to the social justice implications of one's work. Extensive and multimodal collaborations with Research Partners who are already deeply engaged in funded research in health issues in our local community will elevate the scope and impact of our institutional research efforts, and help to augment our focus on health and health disparities research. Our theoretically-based innovation of establishing a CRT-informed research program will be further advanced by embracing recent technological innovation that enables us to link research activities and expertise on a regional and national scale. Online research-sharing and collaboration tools will not replace traditional in-person mentoring relationships but can support faculty professional development and enhance and sustain the interdisciplinary approach necessary to stimulate advances in health disparities research. Entrepreneurial innovation is also an important component of our proposal. A research and training environment that not only prepares students for traditional research careers but exposes them to the possibilities of commercialization through partnerships with local technology incubators is critical in preparing students for the 21st century research workforce. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Our program, which focuses on health disparities research training, will directly address issues relevant to the NIH and to societal needs. We are recruiting and training URM students in ways that will change the way that research is conducted because of new research questions and methods."
"9458364","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Huntington's disease (HD) has for decades served as a model for how we think about genetic testing, and its benefits and risks for tested individuals and their families. In 1983, the gene for HD was mapped to chromosome 4, allowing linkage tests to be developed for use in presymptomatic genetic testing for HD. In 1986, Johns Hopkins launched one of the first two such testing programs in the United States. This work influenced guidelines for the provision of HD genetic test results, which have subsequently influenced contemporary guidance for other adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases. This early experience also arguably influenced our collective thinking about many issues related to genetic testing and the provision of genetic test results. Almost 30 years later, we are still in contact wth many members of this early cohort.  As increasing numbers of genetic tests are being used to predict adult-onset neurodegenerative disease, and as large-scale genetic testing is increasingly integrated into clinical care, it is critical that we understand not only the implicatons of presymptomatic testing for the at-risk individual over several years, but also for the at-risk individual and her/his family over the course of their lives. Here, we have a unique opportunity to take a retrospective look over decades at how at-risk individuals and their families communicate about and cope with test results not months or years following testing, but decades following testing. We will do this through in-depth interviews with a subset of those at-risk individuals who were tested between 1986 and 1996, focus groups with a subset of family members of tested individuals, and a survey sent to all at-risk individuals who were tested from 1986 to 1996 and their family members. The outcomes of this research will improve our understanding of how the results of genetic testing for serious, currently incurable disease are communicated in and through families, how this information influences choices (e.g., career, participation in research, having children) and trajectories of at-risk individuals and their families over decades, and will help inform policies and procedures for communicating such results.  Under Specific Aim 1, we will explore the impact of presymptomatic genetic testing for Huntington's disease (HD) on the lives and choices of at-risk individuals, 18-28 years after testing. Under Specific Aim 2, we will build on prior work with this cohort to determine longitudinal changes in individuals' feelings about and understanding of their testing experience as they have progressed through life's stages. Under Specific Aim 3, we will explore the impact of presymptomatic genetic testing for HD on family members (spouses, partners, children) of tested individuals, 18-28 years after testing. Under Specific Aim 4, we will build on the results of Aims 1-3 to explore how the views of individuals and their families comport with the current paradigms and policy for the conduct of clinical genetic and genomic testing."
"9350194","Postoperative ileus (POI) is one of the main complication associated with abdominal surgery (AS) procedures. A number of Veterans deployed in the war zones undergo injuries requiring AS. After AS, patients usually develop nausea, vomiting, bloating, and abdominal pain which are major contributing factors to postoperative discomfort. The incidence of ileus is highest in gastrointestinal (GI) surgery with 24% of patients developing ileus and can be as high as 40% in laparotomy patients. The health burden and the cost of prolonged hospitalization due to POI have been estimated to be as much as $1.47 billion annually in the USA, illustrating its large socioeconomic impact. The lack of effective treatments has prompted novel experimental studies to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Recent insight in the pathophysiology of POI induced by AS have identified intestinal inflammation triggered by handling of the intestine as a contributing mechanism which is clinically a relevant target for treatment. In other inflammatory conditions, there is evidence that resident macrophages within the GI muscularis contribute to both the initiation and the resolution of inflammation through activations of M1 and M2 phenotypes secreting pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines respectively. Recent studies point to the vagus nerve controlling a cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. We previously established that thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) in the brainstem plays a physiological role (including in the cephalic phase) to stimulate the vagus innervating the GI tract. In the last granting period, we reported that intracisternal (ic) injection of TRH prevents the neurogenic (early phase) of POI occurring within 2-h of AS. Our preliminary data obtained at 6-h post-surgery indicate that 1) AS increases M1 but not M2 macrophages and the infiltration of neutrophils in the gastric muscularis externa along with delay gastric emptying (GE); 2) central vagal activation by ic injection of the stable TRH agonist, RX77368 prevents the above increases and reduces the delayed GE induced by AS without modifying basal GE in sham group. In the last granting period, we also established that AS induces a sharp reduction of plasma levels of the prokinetic hormone, ghrelin known to influence vagal activity and the response is prevented by ic TRH before AS. In addition, we obtained preliminary data showing that the novel long acting and brain penetrant ghrelin agonist, HM01 administered orally activates vagal preganglionic motor neurons in the brainstem and prevents AS-induced delayed GE. Based on these reports and exciting supportive preliminary data, we will test 3 HYPOTHESES: Aim 1. AS induces inflammation in the rat gastric muscularis externa through changes in the activation status of M1 or M2 macrophages in the rat gastric muscularis externa. 2. Central vagal stimulation prevents AS-induced delayed GE by activating cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway with the deactivation of M1 and or the activation of M2 macrophage leading to inhibiting the inflammation in the gastric muscularis externa. 3. The ghrelin agonist, HM01 is a promising candidate via oral administration to reverse POI by its dual potent prokinetic and anti- inflammatory actions through activation of vagal cholinergic pathway. These aims will be achieved in the rat model of AS-induced POI combined with state-of-the art technologies in neuroanatomy (CLARITY technique combined with targeted double or triple labeling, including anterograde tracing and 3D imaging of vagal fibers, enteric neurons and macrophages), molecular biology (Laser microdissection combined with RT-PCR, RNAscope, RT-qPCR, microRNA targeting, MILLIPLEX® Multiplex Assays using Bio-RAD Bio-Plex 3D suspension system powered by Luminex xMAP Technology) and functional study (gut motility and chemical stimulation of vagal activity). The completion of these specific aims will make a conceptual advance to target muscularis macrophages by deactivation of M1 and/or activation of M2 as a potential anti-inflammatory strategy and provide the first preclinical data to validate HM01 as a candidate for new therapy for POI."
"9336992","Project Summary/Abstract We propose a pre-clinical study in rodent animal models of type 2 diabetes (T2D) characterized by obesity and insulin resistance, to determine if the orally-administered CXCR2 chemokine receptor inhibitor AZD5069 (Astra Zeneca) can: i) improve insulin sensitivity, glucose and insulin tolerance in pre-diabetic mice concurrent with prevention or delay in onset of hyperglycemia; ii) improve and stabilise insulin sensitivity in diabetic recipients; and iii) preserve and stabilise ? cell function in diabetic recipients. In addition, a series of mechanistic studies are proposed to further decipher the effects of CXCR2 inhibition on the regulation of neutrophil and macrophage populations in the key glucoregulating tissues of the rodent study population. This proposal is a consequence of a use case approach to identify phase II clinical trial-ready antagonists of the CXCR2 signaling pathway through querying and polling publically-available drug profile databases and open innovation crowdsourcing drug repositories. The study objectives/endpoints are built upon the hypothesis that CXCR2 inhibition impairs and interferes with neutrophil- and macrophage-orchestrated inflammation that underlies pre- clinical and clinical T2D. We propose three aims to realise our endpoints and to test our hypothesis. AZD5069 is an attractive agent considering the emerging data on the role of neutrophils in obesity-associated metabolic impairments characterized by systemic and glucoregulating tissue-selective inflammation. We believe that this study establishes a novel direction for T2D therapy and potentially for other inflammation-associated disorders of metabolism."
"9330667","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The current study proposes to investigate, using advanced longitudinal analyses, the trajectory of change in attentional control as individuals progress through an 8-week mindfulness-inspired training (MIT) intervention. It also proposes to investigate coupled change throughout the intervention period between attentional control and emotional outcomes. Innovations of the proposed study are the: (a) hypothesis guided focus on attentional control, (b) focus on MIT effects in an age range older than usually studied, and (c) 14-week intensive micro-longitudinal study to permit the week-to-week observation of changes in attentional outcomes as well as select time-varying covariates such as emotion/mood and perceived mindfulness. Evidence suggests that attentional control, or individuals' ability to choose which stimuli in the environment they attend to and which they ignore, declines with older age. Studies from the past two decades suggest that in younger adults, mindfulness-based meditation practice results in greater attentional control. A very small body of recent literature suggests that mindfulness may have similar effects on attention in older age. Additionally, since mindfulness is known to improve some emotion-related outcomes, the coupling of attentional and emotional changes during the course of mindfulness training is an important question for understanding the mechanisms and breadth of mindfulness effects. Recruitment and facilities for the project are supported by the ReVitalize project, an ongoing community-based cognitive aging laboratory. Forty older adults (65+) participants will be randomized into either an MIT intervention group (N=20) or a retest-only control group (N=20). Weekly attentional and emotional assessment will occur for 14 weeks (3 weeks before, 8 weeks during, 3 weeks after treatment). The current study has two specific aims: 1) In our sample aged 65+, to determine the time course (dose- response trajectory) of change in attentional components such as cognitive control and sustained attention from MIT by measuring attention on a weekly basis for 3 weeks before, 3 weeks after, and during 8 weeks of MIT. 2) To investigate coupled (correlated) change in attentional performance, markers of emotion regulation, perceived mindfulness, and perceived mind wandering. It is hypothesized that MIT- treated elders will show larger improvements in attentional control than controls, and these will be coupled with concurrent improvements in mood and emotional control."
"9325061","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate. The purpose of this K01 mentored career development award is to support Dionysios Kavaliera- tos, Ph.D. in establishing a clinical research program that will improve patient, caregiver, and systems out- comes in advanced heart failure (HF) through the delivery of palliative care. His long-term goal is to become an independent health services researcher conducting patient-centered comparative effectiveness research to im- prove quality of life for individuals affected by serious cardiopulmonary illness. Through this K01, his short- term goal is to learn how to design and evaluate scalable and widely disseminable interventions to integrate palliative care principles into standard cardiac management of advanced HF. Specifically, Dr. Kavalieratos will strengthen his research expertise by way of four interrelated career development objectives: (1) to deepen his understanding of the clinical management of patients with HF and the state-of-the-science regarding palliative care interventions in HF; (2) to develop expertise in designing, conducting, and evaluating complex behavioral interventions; (3) to learn dissemination and implementation science theory and methods; and (4) to develop practical skills in the management, leadership, and ethics involved in clinical research. Mentoring and Environment. Supporting Dr. Kavalieratos's career development experience is an inten- tionally-designed mentoring team composed of renowned clinicians and researchers who have an outstanding track record of mentoring junior investigators. His Primary Mentors are: Robert M. Arnold, MD FAAHPM (ex- pertise: palliative care) and Bruce L. Rollman, MD MPH (comparative effectiveness trials of collaborative care interventions). His Secondary Mentors are: Marie Bakitas, DNSc FAAN (nurse-led palliative care interven- tions) and Jeffrey Teuteberg, MD (advanced HF). In addition, Dr. Kavalieratos has assembled a Career Adviso- ry Committee to evaluate his progress towards career independence, comprising: Larry A. Allen, MD (cardio- vascular outcomes research), David Bekelman, MD MPH (palliative care interventions in HF), and Morris Weinberger, PhD (pragmatic clinical trials). As an Assistant Professor of Medicine within the University of Pittsburgh's Division of General Internal Medicine, Dr. Kavalieratos will have full access to the resources, facili- ties, and institutional capital of the School of Medicine, its Clinical and Translational Science Institute, and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. The Division has a strong record of developing successful independent investigators; more than 30 of its investigators have held or do hold individual career development awards. Research. Background: Over 6 million Americans live with the physical, psychosocial, and healthcare burdens of HF. Palliative care, when provided by a palliative care specialist, has been demonstrated to alleviate many of these burdens. Unfortunately, the specialty palliative care workforce is so severely limited that specialty palliative care is neither a feasible or scalable strategy to meet the needs of a growing HF population. As such, there is a critical need for innovative solutions to integrate palliative care into standard HF management, particularly for patients receiving care outside of major academic medical centers. This proposal focuses on ?primary palliative care,? defined as basic palliative care delivered by clinicians without palliative care specialty training. Specific Aims: First, we will develop a patient-centered, nurse-led primary palliative care intervention for patients with advanced HF in outpatient cardiology clinics. With formative data generated in Dr. Kavalieratos's K12 award, we will develop a structured intervention using the Medical Research Council's Framework for De- velopment and Evaluation of RCTs for Complex Interventions. Second, we will conduct a pilot randomized con- trolled trial (RCT) of the intervention versus usual care to assess feasibility and fidelity. This intervention, based on the Chronic Care Model, will partner with an existing cardiology clinic nurse to deliver primary pallia- tive care, targeting the challenges and outcomes important to patients with HF and their caregivers. We will randomize 50 individuals with NYHA Class III/IV HF to the intervention or usual care. Third, we will refine the intervention by exploring its acceptability, barriers, facilitators, and mechanisms of action among patients, caregivers, and clinicians. Using the RE-AIM framework of intervention impact, we will conduct a rigorous mixed-methods evaluation of the intervention in preparation for a fully-powered comparative effectiveness tri- al. To ensure that this work is impactful, feasible, and sustainable, we have assembled an advisory board of patients, caregivers, clinicians, and administrators to provide input on all phases of this project, from interven- tion development through interpretation of results. The proposed research will provide Dr. Kavalieratos with the preliminary data, training, and experience to develop and lead a fully-powered R01-level pragmatic RCT to compare the effectiveness of primary palliative care versus usual HF care in patients with advanced HF be- ing cared for in community cardiology clinics. In turn, this award will contribute to Dr. Kavalieratos's devel- opment as a leader within the cardiopulmonary outcomes research community as he will develop, test, then deploy clinically-relevant, patient-centered strategies to promote the provision of palliative care, thereby im- proving patient, caregiver, and systems outcomes."

This expansion may be attributed to new administration at all levels, the desire to have a more balanced portfolio between teaching and research, the emergence of new disciplines at the university, and the entry of a large group of STEM faculty over the past five years. However, this expansion has placed tremendous pressure on its research administrative infrastructure. In addition, federal regulations and external pressure for fiscal and regulatory accountability have complicated the research administration environment over the last decade. Although the StMU research administration office has been successful in making a number of improvements over the last few years, such as electronic research administration, the overall investment in research administration support structure has not kept pace with the expectations or growth in the sponsored program portfolio. Further, as the competitiveness for grant funds increases,    it becomes more important for a successful research university to have the best support structure to increase the institutions and the faculty's competitiveness. Review of current research administrative processes at StMU reveal several areas that need to be addressed in order to provide efficient and effective services to the faculty. Because StMU is a Primarily Undergraduate Institution it is very difficult for faculty to balance their relatively high teachin loads (4 courses per semester), their mentoring of students, and their other commitments to their departments. If faculty members had release time from teaching duties to engage in intense research proposal development it would be productive way to increase grant submissions. Secondly, the StMU Office of Academic Research and Sponsored Programs (OARSP) has only one full time staff, the Executive Director, a 3/4 time administration support person, and one part-time post-award support person. At a university of the size and scope of St. Mary's, additional support is needed in the pre- and post-award support, grant writing, and compliance and training. Because of limited staffing it is difficult for OARSP to provide the level of service to research faculty that is needed if StMU is to continue to grow and be successful in acquiring funding. The application for funding contained herein proposes three goals to address the current weaknesses in StMU management of the pre and post award processes related to the administration of external sponsored research; 1) To improve the proposal development services to the faculty (i.e. providing grant training workshops, training on use of the electronic grant administration, enhancing related resources for new investigators and hiring a FTE for research administration); 2) To strengthen post-award services (i.e., workshops targeting post-award issues for faculty, developing our website with more on-line sources of information regarding regulatory issues, attending NCURA or SRA workshops on post-award procedures) and 3) To promote the sustainability of improvements made to the research administration process through the implementation of ongoing professional development / training for research faculty, administrators and students. In order to accomplish the goals of this project and to promote sustainability a series of activities are planned, including but not limited to, 1) The training of the PI/EA to become a leader of both short-term and long-term change, 2) Establishing regular training opportunities for research faculty and administrative staff (i.e. grat writing, compliance training, and grants management workshops, and the provision of support for faculty to concentrate on proposal development, 3) The development of an up-to-the date resource library for grants administration policies and procedures and, lastly, 4) The creation of a program to recruit and train new research administration personnel."
"9364481","Understanding mechanism and improving efficiency of somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) Abstract Understanding the mechanism of cell fate reprogramming is important for both basic biology and regenerative medicine. Of the currently available reprogramming techniques, somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) is the only one that allows efficient and rapid reprogramming of terminally differentiated cells to the totipotent zygote-like state. Totipotency is the ability of a cell to give rise to an organism and its placental tissues. However, despite more than 50 years of effort since the first successful cloning by SCNT, very little progress has been made in understanding how SCNT reprogramming is achieved. Although ectopic expression of certain pluripotency transcription factors (TFs) can reprogram somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), these cells are not totipotent. Moreover, accumulating evidence suggest that SCNT-mediated reprogramming is mechanistically different from that of transcription factor-based iPSC reprograming. Since maintaining undifferentiated stem cells in a lineage-unrestricted naïve state is important for therapeutic purposes, understanding how differentiated somatic cells are reprogrammed into a totipotent state is of both biological and clinical importance. During SCNT-mediated reprogramming, donor cell genomes turn off their cell-type specific transcription programs and adopt a new gene expression profile that mimics that of totipotent zygotes. Our preliminary studies indicate that transcriptional reprogramming of donor cells is accomplished within 12 hours following SCNT, indicating that maternal factors present in oocytes can reset the chromatin state of somatic cells quickly upon nuclear transfer. Building upon this intriguing observation, as well as our recently developed techniques in analyzing chromatin accessibility of mouse zygotes and performing maternal factor depletion, we propose to understand the mechanism of SCNT reprogramming and improve SCNT efficiency with the following specific Aims: 1) Identifying and testing TFs and chromatin remodeling factors required for SCNT reprogramming; 2) Overcoming SCNT embryo developmental defects to increase animal term rate. Completion of the proposed study will not only identify oocyte factors important for SCNT-mediated reprogramming, but also improve the SCNT efficiency to achieve maximum term rate. These achievements will have far-reaching implications in the fields of development, stem cell, germ cell, chromatin biology, and regenerative medicine."
"9339657","Project Summary Olfactory receptors (ORs) are seven transmembrane domain G protein-coupled chemosensory receptors that serve as sensors of smell in the nose. Recently, studies have found that ORs and other chemosensors are also expressed outside of their native tissues, including in sperm, muscle and the spinal column, where they have important functional roles. We have previously reported that OR signaling also plays a role in the kidney and recently found one of these receptors, Olfr1393, to be found on the apical plasma membrane of the proximal tubule. Olfr1393 knockout (KO) mice present with euglycemic glycosuria and improved glucose tolerance. Thus, it appears that Olfr1393 plays a role in renal glucose handling. Glucose is freely filtered by the renal glomerulus, and nearly 100% of it is reabsorbed from the lumen of the proximal tubule by two sodium-glucose co-transporters, Sglt1 and Sglt2. These transporters handle all glucose reabsorption, and it is typically only during periods of hyperglycemia that glucose appears in the urine. In keeping with a function for Olfr1393 in glucose handling, we found that there is a 22% decrease in the luminal staining of Sglt1 in Olfr1393 KO mice, but no change in Sglt2. Thus, we propose that Olfr1393 is a novel regulator for Sglt1 in the renal proximal tubule. In this proposal, we are aiming to understand how Olfr1393 regulates Sglt1 by examining its ability to influence Sglt1 localization, expression or activity. In addition, we will examine Olfr1393 in the context of the only other known basal regulator of Sglt1, RS1. Finally, we are also investigating how Olfr1393 signaling functions in the progression of diabetes, and whether modulation can lower plasma glucose. To do that, we will induce diabetes in Olfr1393 wild type and KO mice and investigate their rise in plasma glucose, glucose tolerance, glomerular filtration rate and progression of neuropathy and vascular disease. The candidate's goals are to understand renal physiology and renal transporter regulation, and this proposal will be completed under the guidance of an experienced mentor team that includes accomplished renal physiologists and metabolic researchers. To accomplish this, the candidate will work with her mentors and the Professional Development Office to follow a career development plan that includes manuscript preparation, attending and presenting at international conferences and departmental seminars, mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students, and preparation of application materials."
"9238048","Project Summary Broad long-term objectives: In Specific Aim 1, we will determine the phenotypes (e.g. 7 mitochondrially targeted drugs; non-mitochondrially targeted drugs; growth at low and high temperature) of 98 ± L-A strain pairs. We will identify strain pairs with strong L-A-dependent phenotypes; that is, N1/N1 ?1 L-A0 ? N1/N1 ?1 L-A+. We will also identify candidate QTGs for analysis in Aim 3. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine the phenotypes (e.g. 7 mitochondrially targeted drugs; non-mitochondrially targeted drugs; growth at low and high temperature) of iso- nuclear pairs of F1; for example, N1 ?1 ? N2 ?0 ? N1/N2 ?1 and N1 ?0 ? N2 ?2 ? N1/N2 ?2. We will identify iso-nuclear F1 diploid strain pairs with strong mitochondrial genome-dependent phenotypes; that is, N1/N2 ?1 ? N1/N2 ?2. We will cross strains with strong mitochondrial genome-dependent phenotypes; for example, N1 ?1 ? N2 ?2 ? F1 N1/N2 (? recombinants). In multiple F1 N1/N2 (? recombinants) diploids, we will identify phenotypically relevant mitochondrial (?) QTG(s). In Specific Aim 3A, using our results from Aim 1 and 2, we will perform RNA-Seq on ethanol and dextrose grown isogenic ± L-A parent strains and ± L-A- and ? genotype-controlled iso-nuclear F1. We will identify ± L-A and ? genotype-dependent effects on the transcriptomes and potential candidate QTGs, which will aid downstream analysis. In Specific Aim 3B, we will (separately) sporulate multiple iso-nuclear F1 strain pairs with strong L-A- and/or mitochondrial genome-dependent phenotypes (identified in Aim 1, 2; RNA-Seq in Aim 3B) to generate ± L-A- and ? genotype-controlled F12 populations. In multiple ± L-A F12 ?1 vs. ± L-A F12 ?2 population pairs, we will identify phenotypically relevant nuclear QTGs. We will primarily focus on ± L-A and ? genotype-specific nuclear QTGs to advance our understanding of missing heritability, host-virus, and N-? interactions."
"9335936","PROJECT SUMMARY Shoulder pain following stroke is a major rehabilitation problem affecting approximately 60% of moderate to severely impaired stroke survivors. While many treatments for HSP have been proposed, most do not result in long-term relief of pain. Our long-term goal is to develop a therapeutic intervention to reduce pain related to HSP. In a systematic review of randomized controlled trials, intramuscular peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS), developed by our research group, was the only treatment to provide long-term relief of pain for those with HSP. Our recent pilot RCT compared PNS to physical therapy (PT) and 67% vs. 25% of participants experienced successful pain relief (i.e., ? 2-pt or 30% reduction) from PNS and PT, respectively. Although PNS produced better outcomes than PT, there was still a large percentage of non-responders (50%) in the study. Furthermore, amongst responders, pain relief was incomplete in 63% of the PNS group and 100% in the PT group. Yet, both treatments did produce pain relief in a significant number of participants. Thus, a complementary, multimodal treatment of PNS + PT may increase the percentage of patients who experience significant pain relief and will produce a greater reduction in pain than with PNS or PT alone. The primary objective of this study is to determine if multimodal treatment of HSP with PNS + PT is more efficacious for pain relief than PNS or PT alone. The secondary objective is to investigate mechanisms of pain reduction by PNS and PT. In order to accomplish these objectives, the investigators designed a multi-site, placebo controlled, double-blinded RCT to determine if multimodal treatment of HSP with PNS + PT is more efficacious for pain relief than PNS or PT alone. Measures of pain, pain interference with ADLs, QoL, shoulder biomechanics (shoulder abduction torque, shoulder kinematics, and Fugl-Meyer score), and measures of central sensitization (pain thresholds, secondary hyperalgesia, and temporal summation) will be measured. Participants will be followed for a total of 24 weeks after treatment has concluded."
"9335357","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neck and back pain have a tremendous annual incidence and associated cost. The facet capsular ligament (FCL), which encloses the bilateral articulating joints of the spinal vertebrae, is richly innervated to provide proprioception during normal motions. The FCL also has nociceptive innervation and may act as a pain sensor during abnormal conditions. Although aberrant spinal motions and pathologic conditions have long been associated with pain, the relationship between tissue loading and nociceptor activation is unclear because FCL function involves mechanics and physiology across length scales. Relating spinal motions to neuronal function within the FCL requires multi-scale modeling and experiments to identify mechanisms by which tissue loading may mediate neuronal function. Under this U01, we will test the hypothesis that the neuronal response is governed by local forces on the neurons, which are determined by the complex interaction of the macroscopic load and the microscopic structure of the tissue in which it resides. To do so, we will create new, multiscale models of FCL mechanics at the tissue and collagen fiber network scales. We will use those models to study the mechanical environment of neuronal cells in the tissue and to predict the forces transmitted from the collagen fibers to the neurons. Complementary experiments at the tissue and cell scales will define mechanical interactions between the FCL, collagen fibers, and neurons while also describing the relationship between local strain and the neuronal response. We will integrate modeling and experimental work under coordinated specific aims to understand how the organization of fibrillar and non-fibrillar material in the FCL govern its mechanical response, how the micro-scale fiber motion translates into forces on neurons, and how those forces affect neuronal signaling and function. In Aim 1, we will extend our existing multiscale model of bioengineered tissues to the complex geometry and architecture of the FCL; in Aim 2, we will study a cell- populated collagen gel model to predict and assess how a neuron is affected when the matrix in which it resides is deformed. Finally, in Aim 3, we will use the mechanical function model (mm-to-um scale) of Aim 1 and the cellular response model (um-to-nm scale) of Aim 2 to create a realistic model of the neuronal mechanical environment and response during tissue loading. This model, bridging length scales in a clinically significant tissue, will serve a twofold purpose. First, we will test the central hypothesis above. Second, by connecting the tissue and cellular scales, the project will facilitate efforts to include relevant physiological data on joint mechanics and afferent neuronal function, which will promote understanding of the in vivo responses of the facet capsule during pathologic spinal motions. The multiscale predictive models being developed not only will enhance our understanding of degeneration, arthritis, and injury in the facet capsule but also will provide insight into other innervated soft tissues with complex structure and geometry and speculative pain etiology."
"9314343","CLINICAL TRANSLATIONAL CORE B ABSTRACT  Project Summary  Core B is the U54?s translational bridge, providing essential services that enable researchers to test their  hypotheses in people with autism spectrum disorders, learning disabilities, genetic syndromes, or other IDDs.  Translational research depends on successfully recruiting volunteers with disabilities into studies, and  characterizing them in ways that shed light on the questions or treatments under study. Core B provides these  important recruitment and phenotyping services, with more intensive support for basic science colleagues who  are less familiar with the intricacies of human studies. At the same time, however, the core develops innovative  resources that advance translational science in four, interrelated Aims:  Aim 1. Develop and implement multi-faceted strategies for successfully recruiting families and individuals with  IDDs into research. Aim 1 services integrate with Core A?s communication and education goals (A5.1, 5.2), and  also advance a new, national IDD Sub-Registry of the CTSA-supported ResearchMatch. The IDD Sub-Registry  stands to benefit other IDDRCs in our national network.  Aim 2. Grow the IDDRC?s autism and Down syndrome clinical research registries, and State of TN  epidemiological databases, in both number of registrants and phenotypic complexity. This Aim facilitates  recruitment and unique data mining resources for complementary clinical and population-based IDD studies.  Aim 3. Advance multi-method approaches to measure the complex phenotypes of individuals with IDDs in  descriptive or treatment studies, including promising new assessments in Core C (C4.2.3) and the U54  Research Project. Using the REDCap platform, Aim 3 also builds a novel, annotated collection of outcome  measures used in IDD trials or interventions; a step toward filling a gap in the field underscored by NICHD.  Aim 4. Provide extensive consultative and coordinating services for basic scientists embarking on human, IDD  translational studies, which necessarily entails work with all others in all U54 Cores. This Aim also helps both  basic and clinical investigators navigate VUMC?s Clinical Trials Center, which provides efficient administrative  trial support, but lacks expertise in IDDs that is instead provided by Core B.  Core B?s scientific generativity stems from both the 26 highly productive Core B users leading 43 projects,  and from the development of new, forward-thinking core resources. These new directions allow IDDRC  investigators to leverage their discoveries into more optimal treatments or interventions that improve the lives  of people with IDDs and their families."
"9336886","PROJECT SUMMARY Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is genetic disorder caused by mutations in PKD1, PKD2 and PKHD1. PKD is an important cause of end stage renal disease and often requires renal transplantation or dialysis. Genetically engineered mouse models have been instrumental in unraveling key features of PKD pathogenesis. Accurate and predictive mouse models of PKD coupled with emerging knowledge of disease mechanisms has now positioned these valuable models to drive unprecedented advancement in the discovery and validation of new targeted therapies and new early diagnosis/disease progression biomarkers. An important obstacle in realizing these exciting possibilities is a need by investigators for support in choosing, acquiring, and appropriately using PKD mouse model resources. Over the past period of P30 support we have been active in supplying investigators with PKD mouse lines and the histopathologic support that has resulted in a number of high impact studies. For this renewal, the overall goal of Core C, the Mouse Models and Biobank Core, is to continue to facilitate translational research projects using PKD mouse models. Our specific aims are: 1) to provide a live mouse bioresource for the PKD community consisting of widely used PKD models and models with complex genotypes; 2) to develop and make available 4 key mouse models that would be particularly useful for investigators for breeding mouse models and performing their own preclinical trials 3) to provide mouse model and pathology expertise as well as tissues to meet the local (including Core B and Core D) and national PKD research base needs; 4) to provide custom preclinical testing of candidate therapies developed by investigators for testing in appropriate PKD mouse models; and 5) to provide the PKD research base with access to a full range of transgenic services for creating and cryopreserving new mouse models for PKD research. In summary, Mouse models engineered to mirror relevant features of PKD provide a powerful tool for discovering new therapeutic approaches to treating PKD."
"9274159","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Treatment failure and relapse in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is promoted by bone marrow stromal cells that provide growth stimulation under steady-state conditions and anti-apoptotic signals when the ALL cells are treated with chemotherapy. In the previous period of support, this project has made significant advances in understanding how ALL cells respond when they are simultaneously challenged by drug treatment and provided with stromal support. Modification of cell surface molecules through sialylation regulates interactions of immune cells with the microenvironment and modulates signal transduction strength. Our preliminary studies show abnormally high levels of sialic acid 9-O-acetylation on both mouse and human ALL cells, which is consistently and significantly increased as they develop drug resistance. Strikingly, human ALL cells proliferating in the protective bone marrow microenvironment of transplanted mice were eradicated when 9-O-acetylation was removed through activation of a specific esterase that cleaves the R9 acetyl group from sialic acid. We hypothesize that ALL cells generate 9-O-acetylated, sialic acid-modified glycoproteins and glycolipids as a mechanism of protection against spontaneous and drug- induced apoptosis. To address this, Aim 1 will investigate intracellular pathways activated during death due to 9-O-acetylation removal from Sias in pre-B ALL cells, by expression of inducible 9-O-acetyl esterases in human pre-B ALL and mouse wild type and GD3-/- pre-B ALL cells in co-culture with protective stroma. Aim 2 will determine how increased 9-O-acetylation levels of Sias contribute to drug resistance development by comparing drug sensitivity and resistance in pre-B ALL cells with different 9-O-acetylated sialic acid levels in vitro and in mous models. The specific contribution of GD3 will be examined in st8sia1-/- pre-B ALL cells. Aim 3 will determine how acetylation of Sias changes the reactivity of sialoglycoproteins or of GD3 to a conformation favorable for ALL cell survival. The effect of the oxidative state of GD3 on its pro-apoptotic activity will be evaluated in st8sia1-/- pre-B ALL cells that lack endogenous GD3. We will also characterize critical sialoglycoproteins that are 9-O-acetylated in human and mouse ALL cells for subcellular location, induction kinetics upon drug treatment and development of drug resistance using the C. antennarius lectin that specifically detects this modification. Immunoaffinity purification and mass spectrometry will be used to identify the core proteins that are modified by 9-O-acetyl sialylation and are upregulated as ALL cells develop drug resistance in the presence of stromal support in vitro. 9-O-sialylation has not been examined in drug resistance in ALL but our data show it is extremely relevant to their growth and survival. These innovative studies will yield new insight into the mechanisms through which ALL cells withstand drug treatment and lead to novel targets and approaches to treat this and other types of cancer."
"9386217","Project Abstract Pronounced disparities exist by race, ethnicity, and SES in children and adolescents across a range of health conditions, and many adult health disparities can be traced to childhood social contextual inequalities. Epigenetics?modifications to the genome that are not changes in nucleotide sequence?holds great promise as potential indicators of contextual effects and health condition, potentially uncovering health disparities long before they are normally observable. Building on an existing representative study of children, this proposal will directly respond to PAR-16-355 by: 1) assembling epigenome-wide data on 2,000 children at two points in time, 2) describing methylation patterns in 3 race/ethnic groups and across SES levels, and 3) explicating epigenetic associations with social adversity, biological processes, and socioemotional development. The overarching hypothesis is that DNA methylation partially mediates the effect of adverse social context (i.e. poverty, harsh parenting, neighborhood disorganization, family instability, and parental incarceration) on biological processes related to stress response (telomere length and attrition, cortisol response, DHEA levels) and stress responsive behaviors (behavioral problems, risk taking, and resilience). We further hypothesize both differential exposure and differential response to adversity by race/ethnicity and SES explains some of the disparity in stress response and socioemotional development?thereby requiring formal comparisons of race/ethnicity and SES in the same study. To conduct this research we utilize the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS): a 20-city nationally and city representative sample of 4898 children born in 1998- 2000. FFCW provides a uniquely high prevalence of non-Hispanic Black (47%), Hispanic (27%), and impoverished families, making the data particularly useful for studying race/ethnic and SES differences. Families were interviewed at birth and at ages 1, 3, 5, 9, and 15?with biological data collected at ages 9 and 15. The expected results will be to provide estimates of: 1) population-based epigenome-wide DNA methylation measures for 3 race/ethnic groups (Hispanic n=600, African ancestry n=980, European ancestry n=420) in childhood and adolescence, 2) associations of social adversity across development (from in utero to age 15) with DNA methylation, 3) associations between DNA methylation and biological measures of stress response (i.e. telomere length and attrition, cortisol response, and DHEA levels), 4) associations between development of stress response behaviors and methylation profiles, and 5) comparisons of all these relationships in 3 race/ethnic groups and across a wide range of SES. "
"9301420","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT ? Analysis Core (AC) The Analysis Core supports the Duke OAIC effort to understand and optimize reserve and resilience by providing data management and analytic support (Aim 1), developing innovative biostatistical analytic methodologies (Aim 2), and providing methodological instruction (Aim 3). The Analysis Core contains all the expertise needed to provide analytic support to junior and senior faculty across the range of study designs and analytic issues, including biostatisticians with expertise in study design, longitudinal analysis, psychometrics and estimation of latent variables; bioinformaticists with experience in genetic and high dimensional data analysis; and statisticians for day-to-day monitoring of studies and data management. Data management will use secure web-based methods (REDCap), and methods for managing high dimensional metabolomic, proteomic, and genetic data. Duke OAIC supported studies are constructed and managed so that standardized analytic methods and common measures across studies can be employed. In addition to provision of technical analytic and data management support, the Analysis Core will provide consultation and training support to the faculty of the Duke OAIC (Aim 3). The Core will also pursue methodologic goals of interest to biostatisticians which address analytic issues encountered and advance statistical science. In particular, the study of resilience and reserve will require estimation of multi-parameter models and latent classes. A Developmental Project is proposed to develop estimation models and assess statistical performance (false detection rate, stability, power, bias, and validity) of these new classes of models. Working closely with the Molecular Measures and Physical Measures Cores, we will focus on methods for examining trajectories of change in the biological and clinical variables, develop aggregation techniques for this high dimensional data, establish temporal ordering, assess mediation and moderation pathways, and assess the statistical properties and constancy of the relationships across studies."
"9330422","ABSTRACT ? Immune Profiling Core The Immune Profiling Core (IPC) will provide comprehensive technical assay support services for the hypothesis-driven research studies proposed in the two Projects comprising this U19 proposal. The Core derives its greatest overall strength from the relevant expertise, organization, procedures, and operational synergy of its components. Anchoring these efforts is the Duke Immune Profiling Core (DIPC), a Duke School of Medicine Shared Resource that has been in existence since 1988. Largely focused on flow cytometry-based platforms for human immune profiling, the Core has actively participated in external proficiency testing and quality assurance programs for over 25 years. Assay testing is performed in a Good Clinical Laboratory (GCLP)-compliant environment according to highly standardized and validated Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). The Core is joined in its efforts by a support team of highly experienced laboratory professionals from the Kirk and Knechtle research Cores who have recently re-located to Duke from Emory University. These individuals have extensive expertise in all aspects of transplantation research, both in human and nonhuman primate (NHP) studies. The key services the IPC will provide to Projects 1 and 2 include: 1) state-of-the-art specimen processing and biobanking, 2) analytical polychromatic flow cytometry (PFC) phenotyping, and intracellular cytokine staining (ICCS), 3) virologic testing, and 4) comprehensive histology and immunohistochemistry support. The IPC is well positioned to provide PFC services to the projects under this proposal; PFC having been the technical mainstay of the research endeavors of the DIPC. The present core facility houses a 4-laser BD LSRII, 5-laser BD LSRFortessa, 5-laser BD LSR-X20 and, most recently, a 5-laser BD LSR-X50. Of these digital instruments, the first 3 are capable of up to 18-24 parameter single cell analyses, while the X50 is capable of supporting 50-parameter flow cytometry. To provide comprehensive immunologic support, we have implemented several highly developed components for the IPC. A specimen processing and biobanking service that began at Emory under Dr. Kirk has been re-established as the Substrate Services and Research Support Service (SSCRSS) at Duke following his arrival as Chairman of the Department of Surgery. Through the work of Dr. Kirk's laboratory, we have also established a viral testing facility that will allow the IPC to monitor three of the most clinically-relevant latent viruses in NHPs: Rhesus Cytomegalovirus (rhCMV), Rhesus Lymphocryptovirus (rhLCV) (rhesus homology of EBV), and Simian Virus 40 (SV40). The IPC will provide routine histology and immunohistochemistry assays through our immunohistochemistry service laboratory, which will allow each project to examine the effects of the experimental manipulations on key host tissue. Special emphasis will be placed on examining effects on germinal center formation following the various induction regimens. The juxtaposition of human and NHP expertise represents a particular strength of this IPC consortium, further facilitating the highly translational aspects of the proposed studies."
"9344607","Project Summary The mission of the Washington University Center for Diabetes Translation Research (WU-CDTR) is to eliminate disparities in diabetes by translating, disseminating, implementing, and sustaining evidence-based research findings into real-world settings.

The WU-CDTR has evolved to become a ?network of networks?, with investigators affiliated through a regional resource core with the University of Missouri at Columbia, and two health disparity population cores with the National Congress of American Indians, and the African American Collaborative Obesity Research Network. The WU-CDTR fosters transdisciplinary collaborations, catalyzes new ideas, and supports investigators through six research cores led by national experts in their respective fields that provide distinctive but complementary scientific expertise to inform research with populations at risk for disparities, including: (1) the Dissemination and Implementation in Diabetes Research Core, which advances the study of dissemination and implementation science in diabetes research; (2) the Policy and Systems Science Analysis in Diabetes Research Core, which advances the study of policy- and system-level interventions in diabetes research; (3) the Health Communication and Health Literacy Core, which advances the study of health communication science to test strategies for addressing health disparities in diabetes research; (4) the Health Informatics in Diabetes Research Core, which advances the development and application of healthcare informatics in translational diabetes research; (5) the Research Partnerships with American Indian/Alaska Native Communities Core, which increases the capacity of researchers to engage in translational research with American Indian and Alaska Native communities; and (6) the Solutions to Diabetes in Black Americans Core, which provides methodological and content expertise to support research with the Black population. The WU-CDTR supports a vibrant Pilot and Feasibility Program designed to attract and retain new investigators as well as established investigators new to the field; and it also supports an Enrichment Program that promotes transdisciplinary research, learning opportunities, and mentorship for young investigators. Evidence that the WU-CDTR has been successful in pursuing the mission includes a record of outstanding productivity reflected by publications and funding in diabetes and related research. Success is also measured by the growth of our research base of established and new diabetes investigators, and underrepresented racial minority investigators. The WU-CDTR is positioned as the nexus for transdisciplinary team science and transformative diabetes research addressing multiple dimensions of diabetes disparities."
"9541513","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  RNA interference (RNAi) is an evolutionarily conserved, homology-based gene silencing mechanism, in which small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) lead to mRNA degradation and/or heterochromatin formation in host cells. This molecular pathway is fundamentally important for development transition and cellular responses to pathogenic challenges. The siRNA-mediated heterochromatic response, which is referred to as nuclear RNAi in this proposal, has been of great interest as an epigenetic mechanism by which events at the RNA level can feed back to modulate chromatin structure and function.  The most exciting aspect of this phenomenon is its remarkable ability to transmit epigenetic information through mitotic or meiotic cell cycles. This was best studied in RNA-mediated DNA methylation in plants and RNA-mediated transcriptional silencing in fission yeast. However, the extent to which this process can lead to a trans-generational response in animals remains largely unknown. The most definitive evidence came from the study of germline nuclear RNAi in C. elegans. Although related studies in mammals are far from conclusive, both the heterochromatin response and many of the C. elegans RNAi components can be found in humans as well. Defining molecular details of the germline nuclear RNAi pathway in a highly tractable model organism C. elegans will provide important insights into conserved mechanisms of chromatin-based genome regulation and epigenetic inheritance.  The following fundamental questions in this model must be experimentally addressed for the field to move forward. What are the natural targets of germline nuclear RNAi? How are transcription and silencing of target genes coordinated during germline development? What are the mechanisms of epigenetic inheritance that maintain the silencing of target genes in successive reproductive cycles? Addressing these fundamental questions will help us to predict the sensitivity of a chromatin locus to a targeting regulatory RNA, which is critically important to our long-term goal of targete chromatin intervention as a therapeutic tool. We will employ a combination of experimental and computational approaches to address these questions in three specific aims: (1) Genome-wide identification, characterization, and classification of nuclear RNAi targets in the C. elegans germline. (2) Determine the role of promoters in regulating germline nuclear RNAi. (3) Determine the role of heterochromatin in trans- generational gene silencing mediated by germline nuclear RNAi.  The proposed studies, which probe fundamental yet uncharted areas, will hold profound implications for understanding of genome-environment interaction and inheritance of expression states relevant to human development and disease."
"9358718","Project Summary Abstract Learning new tasks and exposure to new environments lead to changes in the dynamics of brain circuits, as observed in various recent experiments. The ability to embed the statistics of the environment within brain circuits is essential for animals ability to thrive and survive in changing environments. However, the mechanisms by which circuits dynamics are implemented and learned are not well understood, and pose significant theoretical challenges. Recent work in both theoretical and experimental labs has highlighted the importance of circuit dynamics. Yet in most theoretical models the network connectivity is either not plastic, or obeys biologically implausible learning rules. Here we will develop a theory of how brain circuits can learn their dynamics from the statistics of the environment. We will anchor this work in a set of experiments, in order to make it biologically realistic and limited in scope. In aim 1 we will try to understand how networks can learn stimulus-reward spatiotemporal statistics. This aim will be based on circuit level experiments that show how neuronal dynamics change due to a stimulus followed by a delayed reward, and by cellular experiments that shed light on the mechanisms of reinforcement learning. This is a problem we know more about, and it is also inherently simpler than learning the statistics of the environment in an unsupervised manner. In aim 2 we will concentrate on experiments on which cortical circuits learn the order, but not the timing, of a spatiotemporal sequence. In such networks the timing of the learned sequence are determined by intrinsic network dynamics; making this problem simpler than learning both the order and the timing of a sequence. In aim 3 we develop networks and learning rules that can learn both the order and the timing of a spatiotemporal sequence. This effort will build on results in aim 2 in which the order of events is learned in an unsupervised manner, and of aim 1 in which the timing of events is learned using reinforcement learning."
"9376650","ABSTRACT:  The overarching Goal of this proposal is to engineer a replacement airway for patients who must have their tracheas resected due to injury, infection, or cancer. Diseases of the trachea lead to approximately 4,000 tracheal excisions per year in the United States. But unlike most other connective tissues in the body - such as blood vessel, bone, skin and tendon - there currently are no replacements for tracheal tissue that are in widespread clinical use. For small tracheal defects that are less than ~ 5 cm in length, diseased tissue can generally be excised with primary re-anastomosis of the native trachea. However, this requires putting traction on the native airway that can lead to risk of ischemia, anastomotic dehiscence, and mediastinitis, which can be fatal. Furthermore, for longer tracheal defects, there is no approach at all to restore the airway. Therefore, lack of a suitable tracheal replacement is a Significant medical problem.  The ideal replacement tracheal tissue would be one that has the mechanical properties of the native airway (eg. can resist both tensile and compressive forces); does not require immunosuppression; is easily implantable using standard techniques; can survive the tenuous blood supply of the tracheal environment without anastomotic failure; and is readily available. Recently, we described a novel engineered, acellular tissue that fulfills most of these requirements, and which functions for at least two months in several animal models. However, in approximately 30% of implants in rodents and primates, we have observed mid-graft fibrotic stenoses that led to airway occlusion, which contained fibroblasts and abundant collagen matrix deposition, but little epithelial repopulation. The underlying Premise of this application is that undesirable host remodeling responses lead to the airway fibrosis and stenosis that is seen in a subset of these engineered tracheas. Specifically, we hypothesize that a trigger of host fibrosis may be the supra-physiological stiffness of the engineered airways, which can impact the Hippo pathway and TGF-?signaling and lead to fibroblast proliferation and collagen deposition. A second hypothesis is that inadequate epithelial re-population of the engineered trachea by host basal cells may lead to a lack of local inhibitors of fibrosis, including prostaglandin E2. This application will explore both of these hypotheses in efforts to improve the long-term functionality of engineered tracheal replacements. In the long term, the Impact of this work relates to developing a functional tracheal replacement that could help thousands of patients each year. In addition, we may Impact our understanding of tracheal stenosis that occurs in other clinical settings."
"9313341","SUMMARY AND RELEVANCE Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is recognized as the strongest environmental risk factor for neurodegenerative disease, including dementia of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-type. Correspondingly, the neuropathology of survival from TBI comprises a complex array of pathologies, including production and deposition of amyloid-beta (A?) often in association with axonal degeneration. Of particular note, pathologies in A? are recognized across all survival intervals, being present in patients dying in the acute phase post injury, in a proportion of longer term survivors of moderate to severe TBI and in a majority of patients with later stage, clinically significant CTE. Derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP), soluble A? is widely recognized as neurotoxic. As such, A? clearance is closely regulated via enzymatic degradation, direct absorption into blood and perivascular drainage. As a consequence, TBI-associated pathologies in A? may arise through either excess production, inefficient clearance or a combination of both.  A feature common to all severities of TBI is diffuse axonal injury (DAI). As a consequence, there is interruption of axonal transport in damaged axons, which we have demonstrated is associated with rapid accumulation of APP and the secretases responsible for its processing to A?. Thus, within hours of TBI, there is the potential for release of large pools of neurotoxic A? as a consequence of DAI. Of note, among our most recent observations, we have demonstrated that axonal transport interruption is not restricted to the acute phase after injury, with evidence of continued axonal degeneration and associated APP transport interruption in material from survivors a year or more from TBI. As such, through axonal injury there is potential for TBI to initiate immediate and sustained A? production.  However, though DAI is ubiquitous and may persist years after injury, only around 30% of patents develop A? plaque in the acute phase after TBI; these acute plaques appearing to diminish in the months following injury. In brain parenchyma, the principal enzyme responsible for A? degradation is neprilysin. Intriguingly, through our unique studies in human TBI, we have shown polymorphism in the neprilysin gene is associated with risk of amyloid plaque deposition in the acute phase post TBI. However, its relationship to late post-TBI pathologies is unknown and will be addressed in this proposal. In addition to enzymatic catabolism, clearance of soluble A? proceeds via exchange across the blood brain barrier (BBB) and through interstitial fluid drainage along perivascular pathways. In this regard, our preliminary studies in both human tissue and animal models suggest TBI is associated with significant and persisting BBB disruption in a high proportion of patients. As such, disturbance in the vasculature following TBI, might serve to alter A? transport across the BBB following injury.  Our proposal extends our longstanding and successful collaboration between investigators at the University of Pennsylvania and University of Glasgow, UK. We propose to utilize the unique and comprehensive tissue resources of the Glasgow TBI Archive, which we will interrogate in studies directed to understanding processes contributing to A? genesis and clearance after injury across a spectrum of survivals. In parallel, through our well- characterized large animal model of TBI, we will pursue studies to determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms contributing to disturbance in A? processing and vascular injury after TBI.  As TBI associated neurodegenerative disease is increasingly recognized as a major health concern, there is a clear and pressing need to better understand the persistent and evolving pathologies arising from injury to direct targeted strategies for diagnosis and intervention, which this series of integrated, bidirectional, translational studies directed towards characterizing A? processing following TBI seeks to address."
"9321249","PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Parkinson?s disease (PD) is estimated to affect over 7 million people worldwide. There is no cure and current treatment only alleviates the symptoms and do not stop neuronal loss. Due to the array and severity of motor and non-motor symptoms experienced by PD patients this has a significant effect on their quality of life as well as that of their caregivers. Further studies are urgently needed on the risk factors that place certain individuals at higher risk for PD development. It has been shown that PD has a significant genetic component and a number of genes have been discovered however these studies were predominantly done on Caucasian and Asian populations. To date, there have been fewer than 10 published genetic studies on PD in Black populations. It is plausible that these patients harbor pathogenic mutations in novel PD-causing genes. The discovery of genes such as parkin and PINK1 have shed light on possible disease mechanisms underlying PD including mitochondrial dysfunction, mitophagy and oxidative stress, and hence identification of other novel PD genes has the potential to reveal important insight into the pathobiology of the disorder. It is therefore imperative that more studies are done on Black PD patients. In the proposed study we shall examine the hypothesis that Black PD patients harbor mutations in novel PD-causing genes due to their unique ancestry. This R21 project aims to build collaborative research projects between researchers in Nigeria, South Africa and the USA to study the genetic causes of PD of Black patients from these three countries. We aim to recruit a minimum of 100 Black PD patients in Nigeria and South Africa for genetic studies, screen for pathogenic mutations in the known PD-causing genes as well as a panel of 751 neurologically-associated genes. Moreover, we will set up a pilot study to screen for mutations in mitochondrial DNA. Finally, we will compare and contrast the clinical and genetic findings across the three populations and to that of other published studies. Over the two years of the project, research capacity on PD in Nigeria will be developed through setting up the infrastructure for patient recruitment, follow-up and clinical assessments. Capacity in South Africa will be developed through the focussed recruitment of Black PD patients, and the setting up of high-throughput targeted re-sequencing approaches. Capacity in the USA will be developed through access to large numbers of Black patient numbers and the setting up of the mitochondrial DNA sequencing approach. It is anticipated that the preliminary data produced through this research collaboration will form the basis for a future larger- scale R01 grant application. The overall impact of this study is that by identifying novel PD genes this will shed light on disease mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration and ultimately this will inform the design of more effective therapies for not only PD but also other forms of neurodegeneration."
"9280031","ABSTRACT Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates, and significantly impacts the quality of life for patients and their families. The cost of treating acute kidney disease in the United States runs in the tens of billions of dollars annually. However, treatment outcomes for AKI are poor in part because underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Ischemia/reperfusion (IR) is the leading cause of AKI and is associated with inflammation in the initiation, tissue repair, and chronic phases. However, the genes which modulate inflammation in IR are not fully defined. The proximal kidney tubules are the most susceptible to AKI IR-induced injury. Meprins, zinc metalloproteases of the astacin family, are the most abundantly expressed proteins in the brush border membranes (BBMs) of proximal kidney tubules. Meprins are made up of two subunits, ? and ?, which form two highly similar protein isoforms; meprin A (a homooligomer of ?-? subunits or a heterooligomer of ?-? subunits) and meprin B (a homooligomer of ?-? subunits). Disruption of the meprin genes and administration meprin inhibitors protect mice from IR-induced AKI, suggesting that meprins exacerbate kidney injury. The mechanisms by which meprins enhance IR-induced kidney injury are not fully understood. The meprin protein isoforms have common and distinct substrates. Studying the interactions between meprins and their targets in the kidney will increase understanding of how they impact cell function and the pathology of kidney disease. Known meprin substrates include several mediators of inflammation such as (i) proinflammatory cytokines e.g. interleukins (IL-1?, IL-6, IL-18) and chemokines e.g. monocyte chemo- attractant protein-1 (MCP-1). Proteolytic processing by meprins inactivates IL-6, but activates IL-1? and IL-18. Additional support for a role for meprins in inflammation came from recent studies demonstrating that meprin ? mediates the release of the anti-inflammatory peptide N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (Ac-SDKP) from thymosin ?4. It is not known if the Ac-SDKP release plays a role in modulating IR-induced kidney injury. A long-term consequence of inflammation is fibrosis, suggesting that there is an imbalance in extracellular matrix (ECM) protein metabolism. Since meprins cleave and/or degrade several ECM proteins (e.g. nidogen-1, laminin, fibronectin, and collagen), they could alleviate the fibrosis associated with IR-induced kidney injury. Meprins also proteolytically process proteins that mediate cell signaling pathways involved in ECM metabolism (e.g. the protein kinase A pathway). Proteolytic processing by meprins reduces the kinase activity of three isoforms of the catalytic subunit of PKA (PKA C?, C?1, and C?2). The proposed studies will utilize meprin knock out mice to determine the mechanisms by which meprins modulate inflammation and the progression of IR-induced renal injury in the initiation, reparative, and chronic phases. The goals will be achieved by pursuing three closely related specific aims; (i) determine how and which meprin isoforms impact the inflammatory response in the initiation, reparative, and chronic phases of IR-induced kidney injury, (ii) determine how proteolytic processing of isoforms of the catalytic subunit of PKA (PKA C) by meprins impacts downstream targets of the PKA signaling pathway in IR-induced acute kidney injury, (iii) determine fibrosis-associated genes impacted by meprin activity in IR-induced renal injury. A combination of proteomics, real-time PCR, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemical analysis will be used. Data from these studies will enhance understanding of the mechanisms underlying the progression of IR-induced kidney injury and inform the development of more effective therapies."

"9326985","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Overactive bladder (OAB) is defined by the International Continence Society as a syndrome characterized by urgency with or without urge incontinence, usually with frequency and nocturia. The pathology and etiology of OAB currently remain unknown. OAB has devastating psychological and social impacts on quality of life, but treatments for OAB are clinically challenging. Sacral neuromodulation is a FDA approved treatment for OAB. Currently it is only offered to OAB patients after pharmacotherapy has failed. In addition, clinical studies have showed that pudendal neuromodulation is superior to sacral neuromodulation. It successfully treated OAB patients who have failed sacral neuromodulation. Furthermore, recent multicenter clinical trials have indicated that tibial neuromodulation is also effective for OAB treatment. Although neuromodulation is an effective treatment for OAB, the mechanisms underlying neuromodulation (sacral, pudendal, or tibial) are still unknown leaving neuromodulation as a mysterious therapy. More surprisingly there is very limited effort in basic science research aimed at revealing the possible mechanisms underlying neuromdulation. In this project we propose to elucidate the mechanisms underlying neuromodulation of bladder overactivity by answering the following question: what neurotransmitter receptors are involved in the different types of neuromodulation (sacral, pudendal, or tibial)? It would be na?ve to believe that the different neuromodulation therapies utilize the same neurotransmitter mechanisms to achieve the therapeutic effects on OAB conditions. Identifying the neurotransmitters/receptors involved in different neuromodulation therapies will remove the mysteries around bladder neuromodulation and provide basic science evidences. It will also provide new pharmacological interventions to further improve the efficacy of neuromodulation therapy. Information about the neurotransmitter mechanisms underlying neuromodulation could also be useful in developing new drugs to treat OAB. Our studies will significantly benefit millions of Americans suffering from OAB."
"9375087","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Asymmetric or hemiparetic gait is a frequent and disabling consequence of stroke. Although hemiparetic gait is thought to stem from insufficient propulsive force generated by the paretic (i.e., weaker) leg, few interventions have targeted paretic leg propulsion for improvement. Moreover, existing gait training methods often require extensive assistance from trained personnel (i.e., physical therapists), expensive equipment (e.g., robotic exoskeletons, specialized treadmills, body-weight support), and the ability to travel to a rehabilitation center that offers these treatments. Given these barriers to accessing long-term gait rehabilitation, it is not surprising that gait impairments persist long-term following stroke and that most people are dissatisfied with their options for rehabilitation after leaving the hospital. The overall objective of this proposal is to evaluate a novel rehabilitation device called the Gait Propulsion Trainer (GPT) that offers targeted training to improve paretic leg propulsion during walking. It is low cost and easy to use, enabling future deployment in small clinical settings and in home- or community-based rehabilitation. The GPT is therefore be based on a scientific premise of gait impairment following stroke: that decreased propulsive force generation by the paretic leg significantly contributes to walking dysfunction. The GPT consists of a long cable attached to a harness worn around the hips; the other end of the cable is spooled on a reel attached to a stationary stand. The cable unspools behind the person as he or she walks over the ground. Triggered by force sensitive resistors taped on the shoe soles, resistance is applied to the unspooling cable from mid-to-terminal stance of the paretic leg. This system effectively resists forward movement of the participant?s body during paretic leg stance, requiring the person to push off with more force on the paretic side to keep moving forward. The aims proposed here will (1) test the ability of the GPT to increase propulsive force generation by the paretic leg, (2) identify relationships between GPT resistance and an individual?s response to training with the GPT, and (3) evaluate the effects of longer-term training with the GPT in a pilot study. The rationale for the current proposal is that, once we know the efficacy of the GPT and how to optimally deliver GPT therapy to individual people, we can then develop a personalized method for gait training that can be used by a large segment of the stroke population who want to improve their walking."
"9455194","Project Summary  Previously, we identified the small, Ras-like GTPase Rem2 as a critical regulator of neuronal morphology, synapse formation and neuronal plasticity in the vertebrate nervous system. Rem2 is a member of the RGK family of non-canonical Ras-like GTPases and is primarily expressed in the brain. Our published studies demonstrated that Rem2 functions in a CaMK signaling pathway that restricts dendritic branching. In fact, Rem2 is itself a substrate of CaMKII, and phosphorylation of Rem2 by CaMKII is required for Rem2 to regulate dendritic branching. CaMKII is an abundant protein kinase that serves many functions in diverse tissues including regulation of activity-dependent dendritic remodeling, Long Term Potentiation (LTP), which is the biological correlate of learning and memory, and regulation of hypertrophy and Ca2+ homeostasis in heart muscle.  To better understand Rem2 signaling, we took an unbiased, proteomics approach to identify Rem2 interacting proteins and found that Rem2 interacts with all four CaMKII isoforms. Using an in vitro kinase assay with purified proteins, we demonstrated that Rem2, while a substrate of CaMKII, also potently inhibits its kinase activity. This suggests that Rem2 is a direct, endogenous inhibitor of CaMKII activity, a previously un-described function for this protein. While many pathways that activate CaMKII have been identified, there is only one other molecule described thus far in mammalian cells that inhibits CaMKII signaling (CaMKIIN). Interestingly, other RGK family members influence CaMKII activity in different cell types, although the exact mechanism of this regulation has not been reported. We propose experiments that will provide a detailed, mechanistic understanding of CaMKII inhibition by Rem2 and further, determine if inhibition of CaMKII activity is a conserved function of the RGK family."
"9352231","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fibrosis  of  the  bone  marrow  (myelofibrosis  or  MF)  is  a  common  pathologic  feature  of  hematologic  myeloproliferative disorders (MPD). It is associated with a dysregulated excessive or dysplastic production of blood cells driven by the gain-of-function mutations. While the common mutation of MF has been identified and  the  mutation  profile  is  relatively  uniform  across  most  patients,  the  clinical  outcomes  vary  substantially.  It has been observed that patients with MPD are characterized by a systemic inflammatory response notable for high levels of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are highest in MF and associated with enlarged spleen (splenomegaly) and reduced overall survival.  It  is  believed  that  cytokine-secreting  cells  in  the  bone  marrow  compartment ar mechanistically linked to pathogenesis and therapeutic response of MF. We hypothesize that  detecting  these  cells  and  their  cytokine  functions  can  detect  MF  at  earlier  stages  and potentially  predict  the  likelihood  of  malignant  progression  to  leukemia  or  therapeuticall  reversing  the  pathological  condition  in  patients.  Yet,  there  are  significant  challenges  n  the  clinic  settings  including  the  large  degree  of  cellular  heterogeneity in the bone marro compartment, the wide spectrum of cytokine functions on the individual cell  basis, and the inability to conduct informative molecular measurement from limited quantitates of bone marrow  biopsy specimens. This application aims to apply a microchip technology for single-cell, highly multiplex ( up to  42) cytokine assay to examine the cytokine functions of hematopoietic cells in bone marrow or even blood from  patients  with  MF.  This technology uniquely addressed the aforementioned challenges via micro engineering.  We have demonstrated informative cytokine functional profiling in individual bone marrow cells from MF mouse models.  In  this  work,  we  propose  to  develop  new  methods  based  on  this  platform  to  detect  and  measure  myelofibrosis in human. Specifically, we will detect (1) cytokine secretion in blood and bone marrow cells from  MF patients, (2) compare single-cell cytokine profiles between patients with polycythemia vera (PV), essential  thrombocytosis  (ET)  and  MF  to  distinguish  non-fibrotic  and  fibrotic  disease  states,  and  detect  abnormal  cytokine-secreting hematopoietic cells in blood to monitor for MF progression. Ultimately, it has the potential to  result  in  a  clinically practical  tool  for  early  diagnosis,  therapeutic  stratification,  and  monitoring  of  human  myelofibrosis."
"9289923","Foxp3+ regulatory T (TR) cells are pivotal to the maintenance of peripheral immunological tolerance. This complex population includes the ?natural? TR (nTR) lineage that develops in the thymus and the comparatively unstable ?induced? TR (iTR) cells that arise from conventional T cells in the periphery. Loss of function Foxp3 mutations in humans and in mice give rise to TR cells lacking in regulatory activities, resulting in fatal autoimmunity. In Foxp3-sufficient hosts, instability of Foxp3 expression in iTR cells, especially under inflammatory conditions, gives rise to Foxp3-deficient ex-iTR cells that are pathogenic. Foxp3 deficient TR cells continue to express core elements of the canonical TR transcriptional signature. However, they also acquire a phenotype and transcriptional profile similar to terminally differentiated effector T (TEff)-like cells. They switch their energy metabolism to aerobic glycolysis, exhibit mTORC1 and mTORC2 activation and produce Th1, Th2 and Th17 cytokines that contribute to systemic inflammation. The molecular mechanisms mediating the acquisition by Foxp3-deficient TR cells of a TEff phenotype and the abrogation of their suppressive function remain obscure. To elucidate these mechanisms, we have created a novel mutant Foxp3 allele (Foxp?EGFPiCre) that simultaneously abrogates expression of Foxp3 while driving the expression of a humanized Cre recombinase (iCre) fused with an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). We demonstrate that Foxp?EGFPiCre TR (?TR) cell-specific deletion of Rictor, which encodes an essential component of the mammalian target of Rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2), substantially ameliorates the disease associated with Foxp3 deficiency. Rictor deletion in ?TR cells restores nuclear Foxo1 localization, suppresses Th1 programing, inhibits aerobic glycolysis, and partially rescues regulatory activity. Accordingly, we hypothesize that TR cell failure due to genetic or acquired Foxp3 deficiency is driven by the dysregulation of a limited but critical set of molecular pathways, including the mTORC2/AKT/Foxo1 axis and metabolic regulators of aerobic glycolysis, that together oversee the transformation of the ?TR and ex-TR cells into TEff -like cells. In this proposal, we will examine the mechanisms by which dysregulation of these pathways impair ?TR cell function. We will then use mTORC2/AKT/Foxo1 axis inhibition and metabolic reprogramming to improve the stability and function of iTR cells in TR-cell based treatment models of autoimmune disease. The proposed experiments will elucidate the pathogenesis of autoimmune or dysregulatory diseases stemming from genetic or acquired loss of Foxp3 expression. Critically, they will enable the creation of new therapies designed to rescue the regulatory activity of dysfunctional TR cells. Such therapeutic approaches are eminently applicable to boosting TR cell function in common disease states that include autoimmunity and graft versus host disease."
"9373020","Abstract Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a significant problem affecting millions of Americans. Psychosocial approaches have been shown to be efficacious for addressing the multidimensional nature of CLBP. Three of the most widely implemented nonpharmacological techniques for CLBP management are Cognitive Therapy (CT), Mindfulness Meditation (MM), and Behavioral Activation (BA). However, there is a critical lack of research examining if these techniques work via the mechanisms specified by theory. Research examining mechanisms ? how does treatment work (mediation) ? is needed. Moreover, although past research underscores the problem of relapse following treatment, the mechanisms underlying the loss of treatment- related gains (experienced by many but not all individuals) are not well understood; hence relapse prevention interventions lack a precise, empirically guided formulation. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and ActiGraph technology embedded within a randomized controlled trial, consisting of daily measures of process and outcome, is ideal for testing mechanism models both during treatment and during the critical period following treatment. Thus, the current proposal seeks to utilize EMA and ActiGraph to examine if changes in cognitive content, cognitive process, and activity level are mechanisms specific to CT, MM and BA respectively for reducing pain interference (primary outcome), or if they are mechanisms shared by CT, MM and BA. Time course of lagged effects will be examined within the context of the specific and shared mechanisms model both during treatment and during the critical time epoch immediately following treatment. Elucidating the mechanisms of these three specific pain coping skills will lead to streamlined CLBP interventions, and provide a basis for development of precisely formulated relapse prevention interventions."

"9323482","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stem cell transplantation is frequently used as a consolidation or salvage treatment for many patients with poor prognosis hematological malignancies. However, disease recurrence remains the major cause of treatment failure after autologous SCT, as the graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effects mediated by the donor-derived immune components infused with an allograft are lacking. Hence development of non-toxic consolidation treatments after transplant remains a highly desirable objective and the adoptive transfer of antigen/tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) is one promising approach. The introduction of chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) into T cells allows the rapid generation of effector cells specific for virtually any surface molecule and has significantly increased the clinical applicability of adoptive transfer of tumor-specific CTLs. Our central hypothesis is that y combining ASCT with tumor directed CAR+ T cells it should be possible to retain the superior safety of autologous SCT, whilst adding an effective GVT component. We propose to test this hypothesis in patients with CD30+ malignancies (including HL and ALCL) undergoing ASCT and at high risk of relapse, as we have a novel CAR targeting the CD30 molecule and new immune-based approaches are urged to prevent the diseases recurrence after ASCT in these patients. In the proposed phase I study we will address if combining CAR-based therapies with ASCT will reduce the risk of toxicities associated with high tumor burden, tumor immune evasion of this cell therapy, and if T cells grafted with our novel CAR and expended in IL-15 will have enhance persistence, expansion and in vivo activity. On completion of this first-in-man study we will know whether the infusion of CAR+ T cells is safe, and whether the cells persist and have in vivo functionality. All components to execute the study are in place and we have sufficient individual and institutional experience to ensure the study will be opened, completed and analyzed as planned, providing valuable information about the use of T cell immunotherapy after SCT."

"9322321","ABSTRACT: Hepato/renal fibrocystic disease (HRFD) is caused by mutations in genes whose protein products are associated with cilia. Mutations in PKD1 and PKD2 cause autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (PKD) and mutations in PKHD1 cause autosomal recessive PKD. There are also a number of rare forms of HRFD, which may provide valuable insights into common/unique mechanisms for cystic development. Recent work has focused on understanding the cell signaling pathways that lead to HRFD. Although a number of candidate signaling pathways have been identified, the signaling events that lead to initiation and progression of HRFD have not been elucidated. There is currently no approved treatment for HRFD. The UAB P30 Center will provide the Investigator Base with state-of-the-art HRFD models from Core B which are informed by human HRFD mutational analysis from Core A. Core C will provided integrated physiology-proteomics- genomics characterization of HRFD models and Core D will provide evaluation of therapeutic efficacy of candidate drugs. Core C provides comprehensive services that are not typically available to HRFD investigators at their home institution. The over arching premise of Core C is that to understand HRFD and to test therapeutic compounds requires the ability to assess physiological readouts in both in vivo and in vitro systems. Cell signaling and drug efficacy will be tested in accelerated models of HRFD, which will include reduced renal mass hypertrophic signaling, toxins, and ischemia reperfusion. The First Aim is to characterize mouse models of HRFD in vivo. This will include measurements of ambulatory blood pressure, GFR, cystic progression, and renal damage/disease progression. Studies will be performed using multiphoton confocal imaging, using recently developed cilia tagged or biosensor (GCaMP Ca2+) mice. The Second Aim is to establish mTERT and hTERT immortalized cell lines from human HRFD patients and mice generated by Core B. This will involve early passage Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (TERT) immortalization of cells to maintain cell physiology states. For human cell lines, genetic analysis will be performed to identify the specific gene mutation in conjunction with Core A. Core C will serve as a central repository for cell lines from a diverse array of HRFDs. The Third Aim will use integrated physiological and molecular approaches for characterization of HFRD cell lines. Multiple approaches will be used to study immortalized cell lines and to examine efficacy of drugs. The effects of flow on cell signaling and proliferative pathways will be assessed using biosensor cells, fluorescence probes, gene array, proteomic analysis, and RNAseq. Three-dimensional gel matrix systems will be used to study cystic growth in vitro. Electrophysiology and tubular perfusion will be used to study specific channels and assess electrolyte transport in HRFD. Core C serves as a valuable resource for the Investigator Base to define the cellular mechanism(s) that lead to cyst initiation and progression and to evaluate the efficacy of potential therapeutic agents that will be effective in treating HRFD."
"9208435","CORE A PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The primary goal of this Core is to generate humanized mice that can be used to test HCMV latency and reactivation as well as hematopoiesis using HCMV mutants generated in Projects 1-5. The long-term goal of Core A is to generate huBLT mice to answer in vivo questions of HCMV latency, reactivation and hematopoiesis based on in vitro CMV models proposed in the various studies embedded in the Program Project. First, the Core will generate huBLT mice to analyze HCMV mutants generated in Projects 1-4 for their ability to establish and maintain latency and reactivate following treatment with G-CSF and AMD-3100. Once Projects 1-4 will have identified signaling pathways and/or secreted factors that are important for HCMV latency and reactivation, Core A will validate them using chemical inhibitors, neutralizing antibodies, recombinant HCMV expressing shRNAs and/or addition of cytokines/growth factors required for reactivation. Second, the Core will analyze hematopoiesis in huBLT mice infected with WT HCMV (Project 5) or viral mutants (Projects 1-4) and then will validate the results using chemical inhibitors, neutralizing antibodies, recombinant HCMV expressing shRNAs and/or addition of cytokines/growth factors required for hematopoiesis."
"9237812","Unconventional sources of peptides for antigen presentation Project Abstract  The long term goals of this project are to understand how the antigen processing pathway generates peptide/MHC class I complexes (pMHC I) by cryptic translation. Numerous studies, from different laboratories, have shown that naturally processed pMHC I on the surface of tumors, virally infected cells, transfected or even normal cells arise from regions of mRNAs that were not expected to be translated. The mechanism that allows cells to sample this cryptic source of antigenic precursors versus other conventional sources are poorly understood. Moreover, the conditions that enhance presentation of cryptic peptides in cells are not well defined.  Here we will test the hypotheses that (a) cryptic pMHC arise due to translation initiated by a distinct and novel set of tRNAs and ribosomes, (b) expression of cryptic pMHC I is regulated in cells under stress, and (c) the eIF2A translation initiation factor makes a key contribution to the cryptic pMHC I repertoire and immunity.  We anticipate that an improved understanding of how cryptic pMHC I are generated will not only provide a means to tap into a novel sources of antigenic peptides and new approaches to vaccine design for intractable viruses and cancer, but will also yield new insights into protein translation and immune surveillance mechanisms.  "
"9381672","Understanding the relationship between A? and memory dysfunction in Alzheimer?s disease remains an essential objective. Although animal models of Alzheimer?s that over-express the amyloid precursor protein show perturbed calcium in individual neurons, memory is fundamentally a neural systems property of the intact hippocampus, and how A? impacts the integrity of neural systems calcium activity in the functioning hippocampus is unknown. During exploratory behavior, neurons represent space as place fields, coordinating their action potentials with the hippocampal theta oscillation, a rhythm dependent on acetylcholinergic (ACh) inputs from the medial septum; but during quiet wakefulness and slow wave sleep, ACh levels fall and theta is replaced with a physiological state in which neurons fire instead with sharp- wave ripple events. Given that ACh?s contribution to hippocampal function extends to Alzheimer?s, with ACh esterase inhibitors providing the mainstay of therapy and associated with significant improvements in memory, we hypothesize that the cholinergic system impacts the neurophysiological effects of A? deposition, such that A??s effects on dynamic calcium activity in the functioning hippocampus will depend on hippocampal state and cholinergic tone across the sleep-wake cycle. In addition, since fluctuations in cytoplasmic calcium may derive both from neuronal depolarization and from calcium-induced calcium release, calcium activity may be an imperfect surrogate for electrophysiological activity. To address these issues, we will study (1) the relationship between neuronal calcium activity and hippocampal electrophysiology in freely behaving normal animals, (2) how this relationship is impacted by A??in two Alzheimer?s disease mouse models, and (3) how ACh impacts A?'s effects on calcium activity and action potentials. To investigate these aims, we will combine chronic electrophysiological techniques with newly available miniature microscope imaging technologies (Inscopix head mounted mini-microscope) and robust, genetically encoded calcium fluorophores (GCAMP6f). We will acquire local field potentials together with single unit recordings and calcium imaging of hippocampal neurons as A? over-expressing mice and littermate controls perform a behavioral task and across their sleep-wake cycles. We will attempt to rescue A?-associated abnormalities with a ?-secretase1 inhibitor now in clinical trials, and we will employ pharmacology to evaluate the impact of ACh on A??s effects on hippocampal physiology. Together, these efforts will establish the effects of A??on neuronal action potential activity and calcium activity across the sleep-wake cycle, providing key insights into Alzheimer?s disease and identifying new targets for its treatment."

CBI is a shared research center for research and teaching in visual and cognitive neuroscience at NYU. CBI is located on the ground floor and second floor of the same building that houses most of the vision core faculty. The CBI is now in its eleventh full year of operation, and members of the Core faculty are among its most active users. The Functional Imaging Module will enable NEI grantees and other vision researchers to develop, implement, and maintain technical advances, including software for real-time MRI image reconstruction to correct the image distortions in MR images, software for file format conversion, software for data quality assurance, the transition to a new Siemens Prisma MRI scanner, the development of awake monkey fMRI, and the development of MRI-compatible transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The module will also support the nightly backup and databases for anatomical MRI, fMRI, EEG and MEG datasets. The module will leverage research support by stimulating collaborative research between members of the Core faculty, and by facilitating sharing techniques and instrumentation between members of the Core faculty. The technical developments will also be shared with vision scientists at other institutions. Finally, the module will contribute to recruiting and retaining faculty, postdocs, and graduate students, and skilled and experienced CBI staff. The Functional Imaging Module provides moderate or extensive support for 11 members of the Vision Core, including two young investigators and 9 NEI funded investigators, 7 of whom hold qualifying grants."
"9320644","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Interindividual differences in pharmacological response contribute significantly to the morbidity and mortality often associated with therapeutic treatments of disease. Genetic variation represents a major source of this variability. Yet despite  considerable research effort over the past 20 years to identify genetic and other causes of variable drug response, much remains unknown. We posit that this is the result in part of unrecognized gene-environment-drug (GED) and polygenic-drug (PGD) interactions. While the challenges in conducting research in this area are considerable, we believe that significant inroads to understanding GED and PGD interactions can be made by developing sound mechanistic hypotheses and careful design of basic and translational studies. In this Program Project grant application, we propose three, highly interactive research Projects, and two supporting Cores, that together will develop and apply novel, generalizable approaches to understanding and predicting GED and PGD interactions in the context of preventing thromboembolic events in individuals with cardiovascular disease through the use of anticoagulation and antiplatelet drug therapies. The interaction of environmental exposures and anticoagulation/antiplatelet drugs with the vitamin K-dependent coagulation and platelet activation cascades offers an exceptional opportunity to study GED and PGD effects. Central to this effort will be our continued collaboration with American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations of the Northwest and Alaska who have unique and often well-defined dietary and other environmental exposures that preliminary data suggests modify the coagulation pathway and platelet function; enrichment of unique, functionally important genotypes; and reduced genomic heterogeneity overall, compared to the general US population. Moreover, there is a strong moral imperative to conduct health research with AI/AN people, as they are often left out of such investigations and, thus, do not receive the potential benefits that such research can provide. Thus, our overall Program goals are to: 1) to advance our understanding of how genetic and environmental factors affect anti-coagulation and anti-platelet pharmacological responses, and 2) to more broadly improve the national environment for genomic research with AI/AN populations."
"9384118","PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT In the United States, metastatic breast cancer (MBC) accounts for over 40,000 deaths each year. Estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) MBC is present in up to 80% of MBC patients, and is treated by hormone therapy- based regimens. Given the high global prevalence of ER+ breast cancer, hormone therapy has a greater global impact than any other therapy in cancer medicine. However, >50% of ER+ MBC patients will exhibit de novo or acquired resistance to hormone therapy and once this occurs, patient prognosis is much more dismal. Currently, ER+ MBC treatment decisions are mainly based on pathological examinations of tumor tissues or biopsies. However, tissues or biopsies are not always obtainable and can yield inaccurate findings due to intratumoral heterogeneity. Moreover, MBC progression is a highly dynamic process in which the metastatic tumors constantly and rapidly change their genomic fingerprints to evade the attacks from systemic therapies and immune system, leading to drug resistance. To promptly and accurately detect these changes and adjust treatment plans, repeated tumor biopsies would be needed, which is extremely infeasible in real clinical settings. Therefore, it is important to develop novel non-invasive approaches for the prospective prediction and real-time monitoring of treatment responses, which can lead to more precise and timely treatment decisions. In MBC patients, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are shed into blood by tumors, have extremely high malignant potential, and are arguably the most important subset of tumor cells to monitor and treat. Unlike tissues or biopsies, CTCs can be non-invasively enumerated and characterized in real-time as ?liquid biopsy?. The landmark study by our Co-Investigator, Dr. Massimo Cristofanilli (NEJM. 2004, 351(8)) showed that CTC number independently predicts MBC survival. That finding led to the clearance of CellSearchTM as the only CTC enumeration system approved by the Food and Drug Administration. However, although instrumental in predicting survival, a recent randomized trial (JCO. 2014, 32(31)) showed that treatment changes based on CTC enumeration alone did not prolong patient survival, highlighting the necessity of further in-depth genomic characterizations of single CTCs. Single-CTC analyses are highly challenging both technically and analytically, and would have been impossible in large-scale population studies without the recent emergence of the single- cell next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. We recently established a pipeline on the enrichment, enumeration, isolation, amplification, and NGS analysis of single CTCs. Based on this pipeline, we propose a study to comprehensively characterize CTC genomes of ER+ MBC patients using a population-based approach. As, to our knowledge, the first population study of single-CTC NGS analysis in MBC patients, the findings of this study will significantly improve the potential of CTCs in the clinical management of MBC, by precisely tailoring treatment to the genomic make-up of individual CTCs from individual patients."
"9328033","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intratumor heterogeneity is a major obstacle toward understanding and treatment of cancers. We have analyzed cellular genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity in breast tumors and found that higher pre-treatment genetic diversity predicts therapy resistance and distant metastases are the most diverse. We also developed an experimental model of clonal heterogeneity and shown that polyclonal tumors grow faster and are more metastatic, the tumor-driver clone can be a minor subpopulation acting via non-cell-autonomous mechanisms, a dominant clone can outcompete the tumor-driver minor clone leading to tumor collapse, and that cancer therapies intensify clonal competition potentially leading to inadvertent acceleration of disease progression. These data questions current views of how to define cancer-driving events in clinical samples and how to design treatment based on this knowledge. Based on our preliminary data we hypothesize that clonal heterogeneity within tumors drives metastatic progression and therapeutic resistance and that understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying clonal interactions within tumors will improve the clinical management of breast cancer patients. The goal of this proposal is to test these hypotheses using a multidisciplinary approach applied to clinical samples and experimental models. We will utilize a model of clonal heterogeneity of breast cancer that we have developed and will generate new ones from patient samples. We will analyze the composition of primary and metastatic tumors in unperturbed states and following therapies and investigate molecular and cellular mechanisms by which clonal interactions promote tumorigenesis using comprehensive molecular and mathematical approaches. We will explore the role of non-cell-autonomous tumor drivers and clonal interference in clinical breast tumors by analyzing tumors at different progression stages and pre- and post-treatment samples using comprehensive and single cell profiling approaches coupled with mechanistic studies in xenograft models. We will design novel treatment strategies for heterogeneous tumors. Tumor progression is a somatic evolution following Darwinian principles. Despite being universally accepted, current approaches to the study and treatment of cancers do not utilize and build on these evolutionary principles. The proposed studies will address this void by the combined analysis of experimental and clinical breast tumors. Our results will help the design of more effective therapeutic strategies for heterogeneous tumors."
"9332666","Abstract  Control of the current tuberculosis (TB) epidemic will require better understanding of the biological mechanisms used by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) to sense, respond to and manipulate its host environment during infection. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is a universal signal molecule used by both microbial pathogens and their mammalian hosts to sense and respond to environmental cues. cAMP plays a central role in virulence gene regulation in several important bacterial pathogens, and regulates many aspects of mammalian host biology, including the immune response. Many bacteria, including Mtb, exploit this common signaling molecule by elevating cAMP levels in their host cells as a pathogenic strategy. Levels of cAMP within Mtb bacteria increase dramatically upon bacterial entry into macrophages, and some of this cAMP is secreted into host macrophages to alter the course of infection. The scientific premise for this proposal is that the cAMP export from Mtb bacteria into macrophages contributes to TB pathogenesis, but the mechanisms underlying cAMP secretion and its specific activities within the host cell are not known. We hypothesize that cyclic AMP secretion from the bacterium is regulated in response to environmental conditions, and that Mtb actively facilitates access of secreted cAMP to the cytoplasm of infected host macrophages to manipulate the host response to infection. Major goals of this proposal are to identify bacterial factors that i) control secretion of cAMP from Mtb bacteria, and ii) affect cytoplasmic access of this Mtb-secreted cAMP during macrophage infection. Knowledge of these factors will provide a critical basis for understanding the mechanisms underlying both cAMP export processes and their specific roles in Mtb pathogenesis, with the long term potential for identification of new TB interventions and/or biomarkers of disease progression."
"9227430","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Current consensus is that the AD pathological process begins decades before clinical symptoms occur. This long ?preclinical? phase of AD might first become detectable in middle-age as deposits of hyperphosphorylated tau (P-tau) in the transentorhinal cortex and subcortical nuclei such as the locus coeruleus (LC) and the nucleus basalis of Meynert. We have strong preliminary evidence showing that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of orexin-A (OxA) are associated with increased P-tau (r=.52, p<.01) and total-tau (T-tau) (r=.42, p<.01) in cognitively normal older adults (mean age: 69.6±8.6 years). Our study model poses that onset of tauopathy in the LC results in downregulation of orexin receptors, leading to a homeostatic increase of OxA production by the hypothalamus, which results in changes in core body temperature (CBT ) and sleep disruption that cause further neurodegeneration. We propose to test this hypothesis first by demonstrating that increases in CSF P-tau are associated in vivo with tau PET uptake, and that tau binding in the LC is associated with increases in CSF OxA (Aim 1); and second, by analyzing the downstream consequences of increased central nervous system (CNS) OxA on sleep architecture and CBT (Aim 2). To test these hypotheses, 30 older adults (age 55-75) balanced by sex, will first perform a full clinical evaluation and MRI (visits 1-2). Subjects will later undergo 7 days of actigraphy followed by nocturnal polysomnography (NPSG) for 2 consecutive nights (N1 -2) during which we will measure CBT (visits 3-4). A morning lumbar puncture (LP) will be performed after N2 to obtain CSF. Tau burden will be analyzed by PET- MR using 1 8F-T HK5351, which will be performed 1 -4 weeks after the LP (visit 5). There is the potential to identify : 1) an association between CSF P-tau and in vivo 1 8F-T HK5351 uptake; 2) a mechanism by which tau pathology may contribute to orexin dysfunction; 3) evidence that orexin dysfunction disrupts sleep and CBT rhythm; and, 4) CNS orexin dysfunction as a new therapeutic target for AD prevention."
"9320648","ABSTRACT ? Project 1 Patient-to-patient variability in response to drugs creates a significant challenge for the safe and effective treatment of many human diseases. Pharmacogenomics seeks to address this challenge by linking drug response to patient genotypes at important loci in order to better customize patient treatments. However, while much progress has been made in this regard in Western and Asian populations, there remain many underserved and minority communities where very little is known about the consequences of pharmacogenetic variation. A widely studied paradigm in this area concerns genetic variation and its effects on warfarin?s anticoagulant drug response. However, much remains to be learned about factors modulating vitamin K- dependent clotting factors that are inhibited by the drug to exert its pharmacological actions. We address these deficiencies here in Aims 1-3 of Project 1 of this Program Project Grant application. In Aim 1 we will perform in vitro metabolic studies with several novel CYP2C9 variants that we identified recently in Alaska Native (AN) populations. Enzyme variants will be recombinantly expressed in several cell lines and their metabolic capabilities assessed through evaluation of transcripts, protein stability and catalytic capabilities towards several CYP2C9 substrate including (S)-warfarin. In Aim 2, a complementary in vivo pharmacokinetic study to Aim 1 is proposed in AN participants who have been genotyped for the new CYP2C9 variants. Subjects will be given the CYP2C9 probe substrate, flurbiprofen, orally and pharmacokinetic parameters measured in urine and plasma from these subjects to fully characterize the functional impact of the most common new variant, CYP2C9 M1L, which is present at a high allele frequency in this population. Tissues obtained in the conduct of Aim 2 will also be used further for lipidomic and metabolomics screening to identify new biomarkers for CYP2C9. Finally, in Aim 3, we will undertake a discovery project involving global gene knockdown in a cell line engineered to produce a clotting factor chimera that enables high-throughput functional analysis. Collectively, completion of these studies will advance our understanding of the pharmacogenomics of hemostasis and establish new risk factors for bleeding in the AN community."

"9339010","The complex inter-relationships between genetics and the environment that influence risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are complicated. They may include environmental triggers in genetically susceptible individuals and may operate through complicated physiological pathways. The focus of this proposal is to explore one of these intricate webs. We begin with the fact that ASD risk appears to be increased in children born to women who are obese at the start of pregnancy, who gain excessive weight during pregnancy, and / or who suffer complications associated with poor metabolic health, like chronic and gestational forms of hypertension and diabetes. The public health implications of these findings are enormous given that over half of pregnant women are overweight or obese and the incidence of ASD continues to rise. These statistics provide persuasive motivation to implement this proposal which seeks to understand modifiable risk factors that influence obesity and poor metabolic health in pregnant women, both for their own wellness and also to optimize neurobehavioral development in their developing fetuses. The mechanism hypothesized in this proposal begins with maternal exposure during pregnancy to phthalates, a set of chemicals that are widespread in the environment and that are found in many consumer products, including vinyl flooring, food packaging, medical supplies, pill coatings, and personal care products. We hypothesize that increased contact with phthalates alters metabolism in pregnant women and results in characteristic clinical manifestations and measurable shifts in metabolic byproducts throughout the body known as the metabolome. Together these maternal biomarkers elucidate a pathway leading from phthalate contact to aberrant brain development and increased autism risk in children. This proposal harnesses the unique resources of an NIEHS-funded prospective cohort of mothers and their children at elevated-risk for ASD, MARBLES (Markers of Autism Risk in Babies ? Learning Early Signs) to examine the impact of phthalates on maternal clinical metabolic endpoints and child neurobehavioral outcomes using existing data. New analyses on archived blood samples will allow exploration of the role of the maternal metabolome in this etiologic pathway linking phthalates to elevated ASD risk."

South Africa needs research on its HIV epidemic's impact on the national blood supply and HIV-related hematology complications. Since 2007, we have already accomplished a series of in-country short courses and identified a pool of 30-50 potential junior scientists for in-country HIV research in transfusion medicine and hematology among SANBS staff and UCT junior faculty and medical postgraduates but their potential remains unfulfilled. This proposal builds upon a 15-year history of HIV research collaboration between SANBS and UCSF/BSRI that yielded research evidence to support a safe and adequate blood supply in South Africa. Under the NHLBI-funded REDS-III International HIV research network, this collaboration will provide a funded research infrastructure for trainees through 2019. Our needs assessment indicates that specific deficiencies in biostatistics, manuscript preparation and research career mentoring need to be overcome to achieve our vision of a sustainable, independent HIV-related transfusion medicine and hematology research enterprise in South Africa. We propose Specific Aims of: 1) a research and development institute at SANBS; 2) an academic UCT Hematology Division; and 3) broader human capital development to raise South Africa as a regional center of excellence in this research. A three-tiered educational approach will be tailored to trainees at various levels of their research careers: in-country short courses on clinical research methodology and protocol design will reach a large number of trainees; for a smaller number lacking skills in study design, biostatistics and data analysis we propose medium-term internships in Cape Town and San Francisco including course work and research internships; finally, for a select few, Master's and PhD training in specific research disciplines will be tailored to their needs at the UCT School of Health Sciences. Throughout, trainees will be mentored as they accomplish their own research projects and compete for mini-grants funded by the program. The REDS-III HIV research network will provide research opportunities in terms of access to human subjects, databases and biological specimens. Research projects will address high-priority questions in HIV-related transfusion medicine and hematology in South Africa, including: HIV prevalence and incidence as measured by novel assays; risk factors for incident HIV infection to detect new trends in the epidemic; HIV-related anemia; appropriate transfusion therapy for HIV patients; and HIV lymphomas. The result of this program will be a substantial improvement in human capital for HIV-related transfusion medicine and hematology research within the two South African blood service organizations, UCT and neighboring southern African countries."

"9237817","Neurodegenerative dementias are devastating neurological illnesses. Estimations point to more than 24 million people worldwide affected by dementia. Dementia ranks as one of the top causes of disability in elderly people, and the estimated annual cost of caring for dementia patients is around $175 billion in the United States. During the last two decades, research has particularly focused in describing the early stages of the disease with the hope of implementing preventative treatments with disease modifying agents. However, the recent expansion of our understanding of aging and preclinical Alzheimer?s disease (AD) through the development of molecular imaging biomarkers of amyloid-beta (A?), and, more recently, Tau using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) has revolutionized the field and shifted interest to earlier pathophysiologic events.  AD neurodegeneration follows specific neuronal circuits of the brain. However, it is still unknown how Tau and A? accumulation progresses along those large-scale brain systems, and how this may produce the structural/functional breakdown associated with symptomatic AD phases. The network nature of AD-related pathology has been recently proven by our group. Our findings have supported that A? accumulates following specific routes of the brain connectome. Moreover, our preliminary results have shown that both Tau and A? networks interact in temporal and cingulate areas at the early stages of AD pathology. In this proposal, we therefore hypothesize that AD propagates along connectivity networks between the medial temporal and cortical areas, leading to clinical conversion to cognitive impairment or AD.  In this R01 effort, we will develop, optimize and validate imaging and network analysis and apply them to the existing data in the Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS) to test this hypothesis. We will first develop methods to efficiently and accurately estimate the covariance of distribution volume ratio (DVR) image and then de-couple the covariance of DVR estimation from the physiological correlation. We will then use graph regression model algorithms to build the high-resolution brain pathological networks, and apply Cortical Hubs, Interconnectors and Stepwise Connectivity analyses to study the properties of these networks. We will also analyze the longitudinal data in HABS using Dynamic Bayesian Network and study the origin and pathways of the propagation of AD pathology, particularly focused on the relationship between the medial temporal lobe and the cingulate cortex. Finally, we will develop a graph theory tool to evaluate an individual subject?s risk to AD based on a matched subspace approach."

"9341323","Abstract The generation of complex and accurately controlled visual stimuli is a major concern for most investigators in the Vision Core. We would all like to generate and control more complex stimuli with less programming effort. The Visual Displays Module supports research within NYU and in dozens of labs world-wide by maintaining and developing software for presenting visual stimuli using advanced graphics techniques. We propose to enhance and extend the MGL package, developed locally for this purpose, allowing it to interface with a wider range of behavioral and physiological response measurement devices and to be used on a wider range of platforms, including different computer operating systems, tablet devices and over the web. The Visual Displays Module is the most widely used module in the Core, and will have a moderate or extensive impact on the research of 17 of the 18 members of the Core; three of these are junior investigators, 13 are supported by NEI, and 9 hold qualifying NEI grants. In addition, the resources from this module have been and will continue to be widely used by vision scientists outside NYU."
"9319731","Project 3 of our Program Project is entitled lon Channels in Afferent Sensitization and Detrusor Overactivity (Project Director: Naoki Yoshimura, Department of Urology). The following key aims will utilize unique and innovative expertise, available in our institutions, to understand the pathophysiology of detrusor overactivity (DO) and detrusor sphincter dyssynergia (DSD), especially by targeting afferent hyperexcitability, which has been proposed as one of the important mechanisms underiying lower unnary tract dysfunction in chronic spinal cord injury (SCI).  First, we will study the correlated changes in bladder activity (i.e., DO) and the expression and functional properties of K^ ion channels after SCI as we have previously found that altered expression of voltage-gated K* channels is one of the key events for the induction of C-fiber hyperexcitability resulting in bladder overactivity. Secondly, we will investigate changes in the K^ and Ca^* ion channel mechanisms in pudendal afferent pathways innervating the urethra containing external urethral sphincter (EUS), and their correlation with urethral hyperactivity (i.e., DSD) after SCI as there are no previous studies that examined the SCI-induced changes in functional properties of pudendal afferent neurons innervating the urethra. Lastly, we will investigate the roles of nerve growth factor (NGF) or brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and p38 MAPK signaling in neuroplasticity of bladder and urethral afferent pathways that underlies SCI-induced DO and DSD. We will also utilize the small-interfenng RNA technique to identify molecular correlates in K* ion channel subunits that induce bladder and urethral afferent hyperexcitability.  The long-term objectives of the research program are to establish new and effective therapeutic targets and/or interventions strategies for the treatment of urological problems in spinal cord disorders. There is significant synergy especially with Projects 1 and 4, which will respectively examine peripheral afferent remodeling and spinal mechanisms controlling EUS function. Project 3 also maximizes the uses of the resources of Animal and Optical Imaging Cores. RELEVANCE (See instmctions): Following spinal cord injury, increased excitability of bladder and urethral afferents lead to overactivity. Determining the ion channel mechanisms involved and preventing changes in their expression by anti-growth factor treatment could lead to a new method to prevent/treat LUT dysfunction."
"9343039","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lysosomal acid lipase (LAL), encoded by the LIPA gene, is the key lysosomal hydrolase that cleaves cholesteryl esters (CE) and triglycerides (TG). Loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in LIPA result in cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD), which manifests with hyperlipidemia, hepatic and macrophage CE accumulation, and atherosclerosis. Recently, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) identified LIPA as a novel locus for coronary artery disease (CAD). Surprisingly, LIPA CAD-GWAS risk alleles do not associate with altered plasma lipids or hepatic LIPA mRNA levels but actually relate to higher monocyte LIPA mRNA expression. Our preliminary data also reveal a coincident increase in both LIPA mRNA and LAL enzymatic activity in monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM) of CAD risk allele carriers, suggesting that monocyte/macrophage-specific gain-of-function (GOF) of LIPA may explain the GWAS CAD risk alleles. LIPA mRNA and LAL activity were markedly induced upon HMDM differentiation and mature HMDM secrets LAL. Extracellular LAL is abundant in the neointima of advanced human atherosclerotic lesions where LAL can remain enzymatically active in the lesion acidic microenvironment. Thus, macrophage LIPA GOF may aggravate atherosclerosis through accelerating intracellular LAL-induced lysosomal free cholesterol (FC) toxicity and extracellular LAL actions on low-density lipoprotein (LDL). My working hypotheses are that LIPA CAD risk alleles encode for macrophage-specific LIPA GOF, and therefore CAD risk alleles or macrophage LIPA overexpression will (i) increase intracellular LAL activity resulting in a shift toward greater lysosomal CE hydrolysis and FC accumulation and thus accelerate macrophage lysosomal dysfunction during modified-LDL loading; (ii) increase macrophage LAL secretion and extracellular LAL-mediated LDL modification driving atherogenic phenotypes in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and endothelial cells (EC); and (iii) macrophage LIPA overexpression will accelerate atherogenesis in ApoE-/- and Ldlr-/- mice. These hypotheses will be addressed in primary HMDM of specific LIPA genotype, through causal modeling in a novel human iPSC- differentiated macrophage (IPSDM) system utilizing CRISPR/Cas knock-in of risk alleles, in HMDM with lentivirus-mediated LIPA overexpression (Lenti-LIPA), and in murine models with macrophage-specific Lipa overexpression by lentivirus-infected bone marrow (BM) transplantation driven by macrophage-specific promoter. These will be accomplished by pursuing the following three aims: Aim 1. K99 Phase: Determine the effects of LIPA CAD risk alleles and LIPA overexpression on intracellular macrophage LIPA expression, LAL activity, and phenotype of human macrophages. Aim 2. R00 Phase: Determine the effects of LIPA CAD risk alleles and LIPA overexpression on macrophage LAL secretion, extracellular LAL-modification of LDL and on atherogenic phenotypes in EC and VSMC. Aim 3. R00 Phase: Determine if macrophage Lipa overexpression accelerates atherosclerosis in ApoE-/- and Ldlr-/- mice."
"9374064","Project Summary  Influenza remains to be a significant public health problem worldwide, despite the heavy campaign for flu preventative vaccination in many countries. Influenza vaccines must be reformulated annually because of antigenic shift and drift of circulating influenza viral strains. However, reformulated seasonal vaccines do not always match the circulating strains, and there is the ever-present threat that avian influenza viruses may adapt to be transmitted in humans. Another complementary strategy, antiviral therapy, is also widely used for treating influenza infection. There are two classes of antiviral drugs against influenza, neuraminidase (NA) blockers (oseltamivir and zanamivir) and matrix protein 2 (M2) inhibitors (adamantine derivatives), however, all of which face the challenges of evolved drug resistance and simultaneously occurring nonspecific side effects. Therefore, there is an urgent need for developing novel drugs/vaccines and combination therapies against influenza virus infection especially considering that the annual influenza outbreak results in about three to five million cases of severe illness and appropriately 250,000 to 500,000 deaths worldwide.  In this research, we hypothesize that a safe therapeutic influenza vaccine can be developed through creation of a new class of live attenuated influenza virus (LAIV) using specific host cell-restricted attenuation. In our preliminary study, using the eight-plasmid reverse genetics, we have constructed a LAIV, which carries an artificial microRNA 93 (amiR-93) expression cassette and expresses a mammalian- specific amiR-93 that can inhibit the expression of a host gene essential for influenza virus replication. Interestingly, a single dose intranasal vaccination with the resultant engineered LAIV provided potent immune protection against challenge with lethal dose of influenza A virus. Additionally, administration of this LAIV 24 hours post lethal influenza infection could completely protect mice against influenza.  Based on this feasibility study, we propose to continue evaluating this new class of candidate therapeutic vaccine in both mouse and ferret models of influenza infection. The following two specific aims are proposed:  Specific Aim 1: To evaluate the efficacy of a candidate therapeutic influenza vaccine generated by specific host cell-restricted attenuation.  Specific Aim 2: To produce and evaluate additional dual host factor-targeted therapeutic vaccine.  Our candidate LAIV therapeutic vaccines will be extensively investigated in both mouse and ferret models of influenza infection. We anticipate that the proposed research will identify a novel and safe anti- influenza drug that can also be further developed as a therapeutic vaccine to prevent future influenza re- infection.    "
"9390398","Abstract Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene and causes thousands of deaths each year. There are no effective treatments for DMD and new DMD therapeutics are urgently needed. Cas9 based therapeutics have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of DMD, because they can correct dystrophin mutations, via homology directed DNA repair. However, developing Cas9 based therapeutics for DMD has been challenging because it requires simultaneously delivering Cas9 protein, guide RNA, and donor DNA in vivo and delivery vehicles have not been developed that can accomplish this.  The central objective of this proposal is to develop a new family of nanoparticle delivery vehicles, termed CRISPR-Nanoparticles, which are designed to treat DMD by delivering Cas9 protein, guide RNA and donor DNA in vivo. CRISPR-Gold is our first generation CRISPR-Nanoparticle and is composed of gold nanoparticles complexed with Cas9 RNP, donor DNA and the endosomal disruptive polymer PASp(DET). We have been able to demonstrate that CRISPR-Gold, can correct 5% of the dystrophin mutations (via HDR) in muscle fibers after a direct injection in mdx mice, and thus has tremendous potential as a treatment for DMD. A successful DMD therapeutic needs to be able to correct 20% of the dystrophin mutations in muscle tissue, and the experiments in this proposal focus on developing 2nd and 3rd generation CRISPR-Nanoparticles, which can generate a 20% HDR rate in muscle tissue. In particular, the 2nd and 3rd generation CRISPR- Nanoparticles address the key factors preventing CRISPR-Gold from generating a 20% HDR rate in a clinical setting, which are (1) its lack of biodegradability, (2) its toxicity, and (3) the lack of cell division in muscle tissue. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that: Delivery vehicles that complex Cas9 protein, guide RNA, donor DNA and endosomal disruptive polymers will be able to efficiently induce HDR and treat DMD. The central objective of this proposal will be accomplished by completing the following Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1: Develop biodegradable CRISPR-Nanoparticles that can correct dystrophin mutations Specific Aim 2: Develop biocompatible CRISPR-Nanoparticles that can correct dystrophin mutations Specific Aim 3: Enhance the HDR efficiency of CRISPR-Nanoparticles with FDA approved stimulating agents  At the conclusion of this proposal we will have identified a CRISPR-Nanoparticle formulation that can efficiently correct dystrophin mutations in vivo and has the biocompatibility needed for clinical translation. The experiments in this proposal are innovative because CRISPR-Gold is the first example of a delivery vehicle that can simultaneously deliver RNA, DNA and protein in vivo and induce HDR. The experiments in this proposal are significant because they will lead to the development of a new therapeutic for DMD (and other genetic diseases) that has the HDR efficiency and biocompatibility needed to enter into clinical trials."
"9323295","The nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily constitutes a group of 48 transcription factors in humans, which includes the receptors for steroid hormones, thyroid hormone, lipophilic vitamins, and cholesterol metabolites. Approximately half of NRs are classified as orphan receptors since they do not have well characterized ligands. Thus, a large number of NRs have no validated chemical tools to use to probe the function of these receptors in vivo. This is a critical need given that virtually all the NRs that have identified ligands are well-characterized targets for the development of drugs to treat myriad diseases including cancer, diabetes, atherosclerosis, inflammation, and endocrine/reproductive disorders. The estrogen-related orphan receptors have been implicated in a range of physiological processes including lipid and glucose metabolism, mitochondrial function, cellular proliferation/cancer, bone formation, muscle fiber type determination, vascularization, inflammation and deafness. Thus, synthetic ligands targeting these receptors may hold utility in treatment of myriad human disorders including obesity and type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease (atherosclerosis), cancer, osteoporosis, inflammation, and deafness. We have developed a novel, first-in-class ERR? agonist that display limited in vivo activity. Here, we describe our plans for optimization of ERR? synthetic agonists for use as chemical tools to probe the function of these receptors in vivo as well as to determine potential utility of targeting this receptor for treatment of diseases associated with skeletal muscle dysfunction, in particular muscular dystrophy."
"9325054","Ovulation is essential for successful reproduction. The ovulatory luteinizing hormone (LH) surge stimulates periovulatory follicles to produce prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Blockade of PGE2 production causes ovulation failure. LH-stimulated neovascularization of the follicle is also essential for ovulation as inhibition of follicular angiogenesis prevents ovulation. This proposal puts for the overall hypothesis that PGE2 mediates the ability of the ovulatory LH surge to regulate angiogenesis within the ovulatory follicle. Angiogenesis is  regulated via vascular growth factors. In Aim 1, we will determine if LH acts at follicular granulosa cells to regulate production of vascular growth factors in a PGE2-dependent manner. Monkey ovaries with multiple follicles will be obtained before and after administration of an ovulatory dose of the LH-like hormone hCG; some monkeys will also receive concomitant administration of a prostaglandin (PG) synthesis inhibitor.  Granulosa cells, follicular fluid, and whole ovaries will be assessed for vascular growth factor mRNAs by qPCR and proteins by western blotting, ELISA, and immunofiuorescent detection on tissue sections. In vitro studies will be performed to determine if PGE2 acts directiy at granulosa cells to regulate vascular growth factor mRNA and proteins. Vascular growth factors act at endothelial cells to promote the formation of new blood vessels. In Aim 2, we will determine if PGE2 and vascular growth factors act at endothelial cells of the  follicle to stimulate angiogenesis. Using a novel proliferating population of monkey ovarian endothelial cells, we will determine if PGE2 stimulates endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and formation of new capillaries. Similarly, vascular growth factors produced by granulosa cells, granulosa cell-conditioned media, and coculture with granulosa cells will be used to determine if vascular growth factors stimulate endothelial cell functions necessary for angiogenesis. Finally, monkey ovaries obtained after treatment in vivo with hCG, hCG+PG synthesis inhibitor, or hCG+PG synthesis inhibitor+PGE2 will be assessed histologically for neovascularization of the ovulatory follicle. The proposed studies will likely demonstrate that PGE2 and vascular growth factors act directly at endothelial cells to promote the neovascularization of the primate ovulatory follicle. Modulation of follicular PGE2 levels or PGE2 receptor activity may provide effective treatments for infertility or suggest targets for the development of novel contraceptives."
"9305823","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Successes in improving somatic and peripheral health outpace our ability to protect brain health later in life. With advanced age, memory complaints become more frequent and severe and the manifestation of cognitive dysfunction poses a threat to the personal independence and well-being of our growing senior citizen population. Working memory, the ability to hold and manipulate information in mind, is widely known to decline with age although the neural changes within the prefrontal cortex that underlie this decline remain poorly defined. Most neural models of working memory support that persistent excitation of pyramidal neurons is required for the maintenance of information in working memory stores. Co-distributed GABAergic interneurons also play an important role in sculpting pyramidal network activity and providing specificity for the to-be-remembered information. As such, it is not surprising that shifts in excitatory and inhibitory signaling dynamcs that occur in a number of diseases have profound consequences for working memory abilities. Preliminary data from our laboratory indicates that aging is accompanied by cell-type specific alterations in both prefrontal cortical GABA(B) receptor and NMDA receptor signaling. Our long-term goal is to understand both the causative factors and cognitive consequences of these signaling alterations within PFC and to use this information to identify novel intervention strategies that can optimize cognitive function across the full lifespan. Our rationale is that thee receptors are particularly vulnerable to cellular insults that accompany the aging process (e.g., oxidative stress or excessive glucocorticoid exposure) and that compromised signaling at GABA(B) and NMDA receptors in the aged PFC could markedly alter excitatory-inhibitory dynamics required for normal cognition. This project will, therefore, use a rat model of impaired working memory to test the hypotheses that 1) altered signaling at NMDA and GABA(B) receptors contributes to age-related decline of working memory abilities and 2) that chronic variable stress that mimics age-related hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal axis dysfunction is sufficient to produce both working memory impairment and alterations in GABA(B) and NMDA receptors. Using a multidisciplinary approach that integrates rigorous behavioral/cognitive analysis with biochemical, electrophysiological and pharmacological techniques we will test our hypotheses by 1) determining if NMDAR dysfunction contributes to impaired working memory in aged rats; 2) determining how changes in GABA(B) and NMDA receptor signaling on prefrontal cortical pyramidal neurons and interneurons contribute to age-related working memory impairment; and 3) determining the contribution of stress and glucocorticoid signaling to age-related changes in GABA(B) and NMDA receptors and working memory abilities. Findings from this proposal will be significant because they will provide a critical foundation for developing ne therapeutic approaches to both prevent and reverse age-related cognitive decline. Furthermore, the proposed research will afford the applicant significant technical, conceptual and professional training in support of his stated career goals and objectives."
"9382420","Project Summary  The ability to preserve the female gamete (oocyte) is critical for women wanting to retain fertility before cancer therapy, treat infertility or delay reproduction. However, oocyte freezing is complex because of the cell?s large size, significant water content and fragile cellular skeleton. Storing this cell and other biomaterials at ultra-low temperature also is costly, which complicates the USA-wide need for more biorepositories to address human health issues. Our research is advancing a transformative way of preserving the maternal genome by compacting, drying, storing at supra-zero temperatures and reanimating the oocyte?s nucleus (germinal vesicle, GV) rather than the entire cell. We study the domestic cat, a model that shares many physiological mechanisms and genomic similarities with the human. In the recent years, we have demonstrated that: 1) good quality oocytes can be reconstructed with competent GVs from early stage follicles that are delivered into high quality, recipient cytoplasts; 2) fundamental epigenetic marks and key proteins of the GV are controlled and sustained within the nucleus, thereby confirming the value of preserving isolated nuclei; and 3) desiccated cat GVs retain viability for weeks, with the remaining challenge being to maintain a low and stable moisture content to prevent degradations during storage. Findings to date have guided us to three priorities: 1) desiccation of the GV to an intermediate moisture level combined with biostabilizing agents; 2) a precisely formulated rehydration protocol; and 3) production of embryos and viable offspring with unaltered epigenetic patterns. The overall hypotheses are: 1) the maternal genome and associated nuclear factors are securely preserved at room temperature by desiccating the GV at a higher (more accommodating) moisture content when combined with biostabilizing agents; 2) key GV components are fully recovered by an appropriate rehydration process after storage; and 3) these enhancements promote GV survival and reanimation in a recipient cytoplast as well as the ability of the reconstructed oocyte to mature, be fertilized and successfully develop into a normal embryo in vitro/in vivo. Likelihood of achieving the project?s priorities is high given our recent results and our access to novel, advanced tools, including new controlled environmental chambers for the desiccation and Tubular Perfusion Systems for rehydration as well as computational transcriptomics/epigenomics to validate the viability of resulting embryos. Besides providing an improved understanding of the resilience of the oocyte?s nucleus, end products will inform on the practicality and safety of GV storage in reproductive health care, management of biomedical models and alternative options in building lower- cost repositories."
"9316204","PROJECT SUMMARY  Critical illness, a hypercoagulable state, and the presence of a central venous catheter are the 2 most important risk factors for deep venous thrombosis in children. Catheter-associated deep venous thrombosis (CADVT) is associated with increased length of stay in the intensive care unit, increased cost of care, and increased risks of pulmonary embolism and death. Yet, given the lack of evidence to demonstrate benefit, prophylaxis against CADVT is not recommended in children. The recommendation to provide prophylaxis against thrombosis in critically ill adults should not be routinely applied to children without pediatric evidence because the hemostatic system and co-morbidities vastly differ between adults and children. Randomized controlled trials are urgently needed to determine whether prophylactic anticoagulation can safely prevent CADVT in critically ill children. However, the timing and level of anticoagulation needed to achieve this are unclear. The goal of this R21 application is to assess the efficacy of early prophylaxis, at standard dose, against CADVT in critically ill children to determine if it should be further tested in a phase 3 trial. We will use enoxaparin, the standard prophylaxis in children, adjusted by anti-Xa level to achieve this goal.  Aim 1 is to obtain preliminary evidence on the effect of early prophylaxis on the incidence of CADVT in critically ill children. We hypothesize that among critically ill children, prophylaxis administered <24 hours after insertion of the catheter decreases the incidence of ultrasound-diagnosed CADVT compared with no prophylaxis. The natural history of CADVT and prior trials suggest that prophylaxis needs to be administered <24 hours after the insertion of the catheter to prevent CADVT. We propose a phase 2b trial in which children admitted to the intensive care unit with a newly inserted central venous catheter will be randomized to standard prophylactic dose of enoxaparin vs. no prophylaxis. We will use Bayesian decision-theoretic paradigm to decide whether to proceed with a phase 3 trial of early prophylaxis with enoxaparin at standard dosing.  Aim 2 is to evaluate the effect of an anti-Xa level-directed prophylactic strategy on thrombin generation in critically ill children. We hypothesize that among critically ill children, standard prophylactic dose of enoxaparin adjusted by anti-Xa level reduces thrombin generation to <700 nM.min, as measured by endogenous thrombin potential. Thrombin generation, which assesses the level of anticoagulation, is best measured by endogenous thrombin potential. In non-critically ill adults, prophylactic dose of enoxaparin proven to prevent thrombosis reduces endogenous thrombin potential to <700 nM.min. We propose a longitudinal study measuring endogenous thrombin potential at multiple time points in all children in the phase 2b trial. Bayesian inference will be used to inform of modifications in dosing that may be needed for a phase 3 trial.  The proposed research challenges the current paradigm on prophylaxis against CADVT in children. Our findings will inform the success and design of a pediatric phase 3 trial of early prophylaxis against CADVT."
"9544382","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        The goal of this doctoral and postdoctoral training program is to educate scientists who will provide insights into the causes and prevention of birth defects and functional abnormalities of prenatal origin. Graduate students are selected from among the Molecular and Developmental Biology (MDB) Graduate Program matriculants with interest in birth defects and/or neurobehavioral effects of prenatal origin.  MDB students take core classes in developmental biology, molecular genetics, cell biology, biochemistry, and ethics in research; teratology students additionally take courses in teratology, biostatistics, and toxicology (recommended). Neuroteratology students additionally take courses in neuroscience.  Postdoctoral trainees take the teratology and ethics in research courses.  Postdoctoral trainees enter the Training Program by applying directly to training faculty members.  All training faculty operate active, extramurall funded laboratories and all have experience training graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Current and past trainees show excellent research productivity, all attend national meetings annually, and all have secured good positions upon completion.  All trainees in the last 10 years have remained in science; many have entered the private sector thereby helping to fill the national shortage of teratologists in industry.  Four pre-doctoral and three postdoctoral positions are requested.  During the current funding period, the program has had additional success attracting URM trainees; in addition, curriculum changes have strengthened training in molecular genetics, developmental biology, and developmental diseases; a new research building and core facilities became available and the MDB faculty has expanded to 85, with the training grant faculty expanding to 15, 5 of whom are new to the grant.  More training investigators now investigate environmental agents than 5 years ago. This program fills a unique niche as the only NIEHS training grant in teratology, the only one with a molecular genetics emphasis, and the only one with major focus on brain development. Teratology is not a specialty with its own academic home; accordingly, training in molecular developmental biology and/or neurobiology in addition to teratology provides trainees with flexibility to enter scientifi careers in teratology, developmental toxicology, neurobehavioral teratology, developmental biology, or developmental neuroscience with equal facility. This renewal continues the strengths of the program from the past and adds new faculty and resources to move teratology training to the next level of understanding the prenatal origins of disorders and diseases."

"9445987","Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) gene therapy has the potential?as yet unrealized?to provide targeted anal- gesic agent delivery in pain patients, if optimized vectors can achieve a key objective in large animals: efficient and anatomically selective gene delivery to the neurons of a dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Such gene targeting could turn even opioids (gene-encoded) into a safe and non-addictive treatment of chronic locoregional pain.  Pain is a national health problem affecting 116M Americans at a cost of $560B/year. Untargeted opioids used to treat pain such as oral oxycodone act on multiple neural structures other than the DRG causing side effects such as respiratory arrest (via the brainstem), hallucinations (via the cortex), and addiction (via the mesolimbic system). 18,893 Americans died from prescription opioids in 2014 and 1.9 million were addicted to them.  Key technologies required for AAV gene therapy of pain already exist such as multiple therapeutic genes and a clear definition of a target cell population, DRG neurons. In fact, analgesic efficacy of DRG-directed AAV gene vectors has been thoroughly proven in rodent models. Astonishingly, however, large animal testing has not been reported for any analgesic gene vector, neither AAV nor any other vector type. Hypothesis: Anatomically selective delivery of AAV vectors encoding a known analgesic gene to select DRG can reverse pain-related behavior in a large animal model of a clinically common loco-regional pain syndrome.  Aim 1. Optimize AAV vector design by high-throughput testing of strains in vivo in DRG of swine.  A critical bottleneck in vector optimization is comparative testing of multiple strains in vivo. We will use the newly developed high throughput RNA-and-DNA ?Barcode? sequencing methodology developed by the Co-I that allows concurrent quantification of transduction efficiency and transgene expression of up to hundreds of AAV strains in a single experiment to define the optimal vector characteristics for DRG neuron targeting.  Aim 2. Develop Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-guided vector targeting to DRG in swine. MRI imaging of the swine spine showed superior demarcation of DRG compared with CT. MRI- mislocalization artifacts of needles used could be corrected in phantom models. We will develop MRI-guided AAV targeting of DRG by convection enhanced delivery while integrated toxicological endpoints into the aim.  Aim 3. Test the analgesic efficacy of AAV in a model of chronic knee osteoarthritis (OA) pain in swine.  Knee OA ranks amongst the two most common causes of chronic pain in humans. We established a model of chronic knee (?stifle?) OA in swine. We will use the model to test the analgesic efficacy and integrated toxicity endpoint of AAV expressing opioid genes in the DRG .  Impact: Large animal gene transfer optimization and efficacy testing performed along with an assessment of toxicological endpoints will advance the concept of targeted analgesic AAV gene therapy of DRG to the point where a pre-IND discussion can be initiated and the additional investment in formal toxicology testing justified."
"9350419","PROJECT SUMMARY Dysfunction of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) is the most common inborn error of amino acid metabolism and the underlying cause of phenylketonuria (PKU). By converting phenylalanine (Phe) to tyrosine, PAH maintains blood Phe at levels sufficient for protein biosynthesis, but below neurotoxic levels. Regulation is accomplished by allosteric activation by Phe. Based on extensive studies of individuals living with PKU, the current medical consensus is to control blood Phe levels throughout life to achieve and maintain normal neurological function; this argues for a better understanding of PAH structure/function relationships to support both the understanding of existing pharmacological chaperones for PAH and the future development of novel non-dietary therapeutics. In 2013 we introduced an innovative conformational selection model of PAH allostery that includes a resting-state tetramer, an architecturally distinct activated tetramer, and smaller assemblies; only activated PAH contains the allosteric Phe binding site. This site is at a multimer-specific subunit-subunit interface, the details of which remain unknown. Our model includes a previously unforeseen domain rotation, which is now strongly supported by recently published biophysical studies. 2016 marks our publication of the first crystal structure for full length resting-state mammalian PAH; this is a long-awaited contribution to the field. Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) supports both resting state PAH and Phe-stabilized activated PAH tetramer structures, and confirms a major conformational difference between the two, which is consistent with our allosteric model. The current application builds on these achievements. In AIM 1 we address the relevance of our allosteric model to disease. We test whether specific common disease-associated PAH variants are defective in the transition between resting-state and activated PAH and thus insensitive to allosteric activation by Phe. This hypothesis is a major departure from the conventional view of PKU as a protein folding/stability disorder. In AIM 2 we determine the structure of activated PAH using X-ray crystallography and SAXS, and we extend our work with rat PAH to human PAH using a designed variant. In AIM 3 we identify substances that can modulate PAH function (negatively or positively) by stabilizing either resting-state or activated PAH. Using in vitro methods, we will screen approved drugs and environmental contaminants, exposure to which can confound PKU phenotype. We use in silico screening of libraries of drug-like molecules to provide leads for future development of new PKU therapies. All AIMS employ established biochemical and biophysical methods to assess wild-type, disease-associated, and designed PAH variants for the transition from resting to activated states. Key methods include intrinsic protein fluorescence, SAXS, analytical ultracentrifugation, crystallography, native PAGE, enzyme kinetics, and the innovative use of ion exchange chromatography to resolve conformationally distinct PAH multimers. Our broad approach will yield new and important information applicable to a better understanding of the molecular bases for PKU."
"9296171","The proposed UNC IDDRC 'Clinical Translational Core' (CTC)  includes services to maximize participation of research subjects  in IDDRC research (the Participant Registries, or 'PR'), and services  to support multi-modal brain imaging, EEG/ERP and eye  tracking studies, including development of novel image processing  tools (the Brain Measurement Laboratories, or BML)  (see Figure 1). BML services provide clinically-relevant insights  into (1) early risk markers; (2) brain targets for therapeutics; (3)  neural metrics characterizing the impact of intervention; and (4)  brain mechanisms, leading to targeted approaches to intervention.  The CTC services complement those of the Preclinical  Core, promoting links between human and animal model brain  and behavior phenotypes. The overarching structure of these  hwo cores promotes integration of clinical and preclinical research relevant to understanding the pathogenesis  and treatment of intellectual and developmental disabilities, (IDDs). Specific Aims of the CTC are:  AIM 1. To maximize recruitment of research subjects for clinical studies. Specifically, the PR maintains  four participant registries: The Autism Registry (N=5,677); The Fragile X (FX) Registry (N=848); The Child Development  Registry (N=8107 typically developing children aged 3 months to 17 years); and the recently established  General IDD Registry (N=82), based primarily on patients seen in local clinics. The function of the PR is  to: support subject recruitment; maintain accurate, up-to-date consent, contact and clinical information; facilitate  subject contact; track participation to limit subject burden; provide feedback to families to increase participation;  assist investigators with grant preparation; and facilitate sharing of subject descriptive data among investigators;  and collaboration with other local and national registries.  AIM 2. To provide cutting-edge tools, services, resources, expert consultation and training in multimodal  brain measurement; Including MRI/DTI/fMRI brain imaging, EEG/ERP and eye-tracking.  AIM 3. To facilitate interdisciplinary and translational IDD research by supporting links between human  and animal phenotype studies in the CTC and Preclinical Cores. Specifically, through the liaison roles of  Drs. Dawson, Styner, and Paniagua, we will regularly explore areas of overlap in clinical and preclinical studies  to foster integration across these domains."

"9366134","PROJECT SUMMARY  Intercellular communication mediated by Cx46 and Cx50 gap junction channels is central to the transport of ions into the lens and to the maintenance of lens transparency. Studies on KO mice and on Cx46 and Cx50 mutations have established that the absence of gap junctional coupling leads to cataracts. The main focus of this proposal is to examine the role of gap junction (GJ) channels in the development of age-related nuclear cataracts. A key factor that influences nuclear cataract formation is the abrupt age-dependent decline in the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) in the lens nucleus. This reduction in GSH levels is not observed in the outer cortex and therefore has been attributed to the formation of a barrier to the diffusion of GSH that develops with age. We have used electrophysiological techniques to show that that Cx46 and Cx50 channels are permeable to GSH. Additional studies indicated that GSH is likely to diffuse via Cx46 GJs from the cells in the outer cortex, where the anti-oxidant is synthesized, to the metabolically quiescent cells in the lens nucleus. In this proposal, we will examine the role of GJ channels in: (1) the establishment of a reducing environment in the lens nucleus, and (2) mediating the shift to an oxidized environment that occurs with aging. We will use imaging and mass spectrometry methods to directly measure the variation in the glutathione redox potential from the lens periphery to the center in the intact lens. In Aim 1, we will assess the influence of coupling levels on the spatial profile of glutathione redox potential in the intact lens. In Aim 2, we will determine the permeability of gap junctions to other metabolites known to be essential for the overall redox state of cells deep in the lens. In Aim 3, we will examine the relationship between GJ channel functionality and changes in the glutathione redox potential that occur with age. Specifically, we will determine whether post-translational modifications to Cx46 and Cx50 accumulate with age, leading to a reduction in GJ coupling, and ultimately to the development of the barrier to GSH diffusion. These studies thus make a direct contribution to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the formation of ARN cataracts, and will serve to further highlight the key role of GJ channels in maintenance of lens transparency.  "
"9365021","Summary Mental and neuropsychiatric illnesses (including depression, Alzheimer's Disease, and many others) will affect roughly 20% of the population sometime during their lifetimes. By some measurements these illnesses represent the leading category of disease burden worldwide. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) of the brain has become an invaluable research tool for studying such illnesses because it allows quanti?cation of the density of various molecules throughout the brain. In the current state of the art in the analysis of PET imaging data, there are two major drawbacks. The ?rst is that analysis is always done as a ?two-stage? process: Stage 1 consists of modeling the PET data over time to get a single (scalar) estimate of receptor density, either for each voxel or for each of one or more regions of interest. Subsequently, in Stage 2 these estimates are effectively regarded as the observed data, and statistical analysis involves comparing these estimates across individuals, between diagnostic groups, etc. This is an inef?cient use of data and it does not allow good precision when investigating some subtle systematic effects. The second major drawback is that the ?eld relies almost exclusively on parametric models. The basic model for PET data in a voxel or ROI is a kinetic model that relies on some fairly strong assumptions about the biological processes that, while they are often reasonable approximations to the truth in some instances, are often thought to be violated. By relying on principles of functional data analysis (FDA), we can open up a powerful new analysis structure for investigating differences among individuals, among groups, and for making individual- level predictions (e.g., response to treatment). This project will undertake the following three aims. 1. To develop methodology based on parametric models that combines both Stage 1 and Stage 2 into a single analysis process. This will allow for much more re?ned analysis that can look for differences between groups in individual kinetic rate parameters, rather than relying only on aggregate outcome measures. 2. To develop FDA-based tools for comparing PET imaging data across subjects, across groups, etc. This will require new analysis methods since the relevant functional data are not observed directly but can only be estimated using some form of nonparametric deconvolution algorithm of the observed PET data over time. 3. To incorporate recent advances made by our group and others, in the contexts of both the parametric and the nonparametric approaches, to the situation in which blood data and/or a ?reference region? is not available. Aim 1 is intended for PET radiotracers in which parametric models exist and provide a reasonable ?t for the data. Aim 2 is intended both for tracers not described well by usual parametric models and also as supplementary nonparametric analysis. Aim 3 will extend the reach of these methods and widen the potential application of PET imaging. These new advances have the potential to greatly enhance our understanding of the biological underpinnings of many neuropsychiatric diseases as well as response to treatment."
"9287875","PROJECT SUMMARY The complexity and multifactorial nature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses unique challenges for mechanistic studies and developing therapies. Efforts to target AD-related pathways have shown promise in animal studies, only to fail during human trials. Thus, there remains a pressing need to identify novel mechanisms and therapeutic targets for treating or preventing AD.  One of the earliest sites of AD pathology is the hippocampus, a brain structure critical for the learning and memory processes that falter early in AD. Decades of research have yielded insight into the genetics and cellular pathologies of the disease, but it is unclear how these pathologies disrupt hippocampal memory processes. The main genetic risk factor for AD is apolipoprotein (apo) E4, which lowers the age of onset of AD in a gene dose?dependent manner. In most clinical studies, apoE4 carriers account for 60?75% of all AD cases, highlighting the importance of apoE4 in AD pathogenesis. Although many hypotheses have been proposed, the cellular and network mechanisms underlying the pathophysiological actions of apoE4 are still unclear.  This proposal builds on novel findings from our recent studies of mouse models. First, expression of apoE4 in knock-in (KI) mice causes age-dependent impairment of GABAergic interneurons in the hilus of the hippocampus, which correlates with the severity of learning and memory deficits. Second, deleting the apoE4 gene specifically in GABAergic interneurons prevents hilar interneuron loss and learning and memory deficits in LoxP-floxed apoE4-KI (apoE4-fKI) mice. Third, in vivo local field potential (LFP) recordings throughout the hippocampal circuit shows that compared to aged apoE3-KI mice, aged apoE4-KI mice have fewer sharp wave ripple (SWR) events?hippocampal network events critical for memory replay and consolidation?and have significantly reduced slow gamma activity during SWRs, which coordinates SWRs. Fourth, elimination of apoE4 in GABAergic interneurons rescues SWR-associated slow gamma activity but not SWR abundance in apoE4-fKI mice, suggesting that the disruption of interneuron-enabled slow gamma activity during SWRs is a critical mechanism of apoE4-mediated learning and memory impairments. This proposal aims (1) to determine the relative contribution of inhibitory interneuron subtypes to apoE4 disruption of hippocampal network activity underlying memory replay and (2) to determine whether apoE4 disruption of hippocampal network activity underlying memory replay depends on A?, tau, or both. The outcomes of the proposed studies will shed light on the pathogenesis of late-onset AD and could provide new targets for developing drugs treating or preventing AD."
"9304361","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia (SZ) is a debilitating disorder with onset in young adulthood, with profound impact on the individual and society. Since 2008, we have made multidisciplinary efforts for this important medical question under the P20 and P50 support mechanisms. Based on our published works, promising preliminary results, and refined experimental strategies, we now conceptualize a new collaborative, hypothesis-driven research strategy towards a mechanistic understanding of SZ and related conditions. Through our past studies, we have obtained outcomes in five major areas: (i) microtubule-associated pathway as a developmental driver for the pathophysiology of SZ after puberty; (ii) changes in stress-associated molecules in SZ patients, particularly in early stages of the disease; (iii) aberrant cortical maturation in adolescence: potential gene-environment interactions during a critical period; (iv) neurocircuitry-guided behavioral characterization of mouse models associated with SZ; and (v) technological development in the analysis of RNA-sequencing data. Based on our own preliminary data as well as information published by other groups, we plan to address the following hypotheses in the coming five years: (a) genetic risks for SZ (or subset of SZ) elicit mild deficits during early brain development; (b) such deficits precipitate more prominent molecular and circuitry-related alterations later during adolescence; (c) stress-associated molecules activated during adolescence drive asymptomatic, vulnerable brains to a symptomatic, pathological state, directly affecting excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) imbalance; (d) such  transitions are further exacerbated by psychosocial stressors in adolescence; and (e) intervention in the stress-associated transition is a key treatment strategy for SZ. To validate these hypotheses, we propose the following three Aims: (1) to define the contribution of genes encoding microtubule-associated proteins (microtubule genes) to SZ pathophysiology, in particular for a subset of SZ in which neurodevelopmental implications may be stronger; (2) to define how genetic risks in microtubule genes in early development precipitate changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) after puberty and how adolescent social stress may exacerbate such changes; and (3) to study how stress-associated molecules directly affect and impair the neural substrates that lead to E-I imbalance in adolescence, resulting in cognitive dysfunction in young adulthood, and how stressors during adolescence exacerbate these changes. To address these questions, we propose 3 projects and 3 cores that are fully integrated. We hope that our findings will inform molecular targets and appropriate timing for early detection and intervention for SZ, possibly for a treatment-resistant subset. Furthermore, by studying the circuitry and behavioral mechanisms underlying specific cognitive dimensions in SZ, we hope to contribute towards studies and treatment of adult-onset disorders with neurodevelopmental origins beyond SZ."
"9415747","It is estimated that approximately half of HIV-infected individuals in the United States are over 50 years of age. Aging of the HIV-infected population has linked alterations in immune responses associated with age and the immunologic consequences of chronic HIV infection. This intersection of HIV and aging will influence host defense against infection and response to vaccines. As a result, understanding the nexus of HIV-associated immune activation and immunosenescence takes on particular urgency. We will leverage insights from our published and ongoing studies on the effects of aging on dysregulated innate immune pattern recognition receptor (PRR) function, a novel population of pro-inflammatory IL-7 receptor alow effector memory (EM) CD8 T cells that are expanded in HIV-negative older adults, and on expansion of EM CD8 T cells in older HIV-positive adults. We have also elucidated gene expression and immunologic signatures of influenza vaccine response in young and older HIV-negative adults. These findings position us to illuminate the effects of aging and HIV infection on innate and adaptive immune function, particularly following influenza vaccination. To address these questions, we have assembled an interdisciplinary group of investigators with expertise in the study of aging of the innate and adaptive human immune systems, and in HIV immunology, biology and clinical care. Our overarching hypothesis is that the pro-inflammatory environment associated with age and with suppressed HIV infection potentiates immunosenescence in older adults with HIV disease. To test this hypothesis, we will enroll young (age 21-35) and older (age over 65) adults with HIV infection receiving high-dose influenza vaccine. We will employ state of the art methods including multichannel mass cytometry on whole blood to assess development and activation of major populations (e.g. monocytes, dendritic cells, NK cells, lymphocytes, neutrophils), including novel studies of platelets pre- and post-vaccine. We will evaluate innate immune PRR function (including Toll-like and NOD-like receptor family members), where we previously found age-associated alterations in cytokine production and costimulatory protein expression that were related to influenza vaccine response. We will also study T cell responses to in vitro vaccine antigen stimulation, including the IL-7 receptor alow EM CD8 T cell subset. Statistical modeling will include clinical and functional covariates (e.g. CD4+ T cell count, estimated duration of HIV disease and of ART, medical co-morbidities, medication use, functional status). Finally, we will derive gene expression signatures of influenza vaccine response in young and older adults with HIV disease, and compare these to those we previously identified in HIV-negative adults. We will employ state of the art analytic methods to integrate gene expression and immunologic data to obtain a comprehensive view of the human immune response in the context of age and immune suppression. These studies ultimately are aimed at identifying pathways amenable to pharmacologic targeting to improve immune and vaccine responses in older (and young) adults with HIV disease."
"9304365","Abstract (Project 3) Recent clinical studies that examine prodromal subjects and recent-onset schizophrenia (SZ) have indicated that stress-associated pathways are activated prior to and at the onset of the disease, in contrast to milder changes of the pathways in the chronic stages. In addition, human postmortem studies have demonstrated changes in dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons and parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons. These are key neural substrates for the excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) imbalance in prefrontal cortical (PFC) neuronal networks underlying cognitive deficits in SZ. Our preliminary data show changes in stress-associated molecules and interneurons in adolescence and young adulthood in mouse models that display altered adult behaviors relevant to SZ. These models carry genetic perturbations of microtubule-associated molecules and show mild deficits in early neurodevelopment. Based on this background, we propose the following two Aims: Aim 1 will determine and characterize the critical periods for changes in stress-associated cascades and E-I imbalance in several genetic mouse models with mild brain deficits in early development elicited by microtubule-associated genes; and Aim 2 will study the mechanisms of neurocircuitry-based behavioral changes associated with medial PFC (mPFC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), such as working memory deficits and behavioral inflexibility. We will also investigate whether adolescent social isolation exacerbates the pathological signatures. Finally, we will intervene with the stress pathways in a molecule, cell type and brain region-specific manner during adolescence to try to rescue adult phenotypes (physiology, behavior). We believe the proposed study is innovative and will lead to the development of new tools for early diagnosis and intervention in cognitive deficits relevant to SZ and related mental disorders."
"9375718","Project Summary/Abstract: The proposed project is a high-risk, high-impact effort to achieve the early steps demonstrating the use of low-temperature corona discharge generated inside the cardiovascular system as a less-invasive treatment of infectious bacterial biofilm growths on native tissue and implanted medical devices. The long-term impact of the successful project is the less-invasive treatment of biofilm infections such as infective endocarditis (IE), which has a 30% mortality rate at 1 year, through a catheterized low-temperature plasma (LTP) device to produce localized doses of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the vicinity of the bacterial colony. ROS produced through gas-phase LTP has been demonstrated to destroy bacteria associated with IE, including staphylococcus aureus, as well as bacterial biofilms. This is part of an exciting, emerging field known as plasma medicine, which, to date, is focused on external and in-vitro applications. This project will open up a new and rich area of investigation for plasma medicine, internal plasma medicine, which has the potential to impact a wide range of disease states in the human body through less invasive means than surgery or systemic drugs. The project consists of three Specific Aims to evaluate the effect of LTP generation in blood, the effects on bacterial cultures in the vicinity, and the miniaturization of the LTP system for future integration with catheters. The first Aim is to determine the effect of LTP generation in human whole blood on the blood constituents' structure and function and measurement of ROS generation in the liquid part of the blood. The second Aim applies the most favorable LTP conditions to bacterial cultures (S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and S. pneumoniae) in a blood environment and evaluates the destructive effects of the ROS generation on unprotected cultures and biofilm specimens. The third Aim will demonstrate the potential for future translation of these devices to clinical practice by miniaturizing them to fit on the end of a catheter. Successful completion of this project will open the door to wider investigations under the R01 mechanism of the effect of LTP generation on healthy adjacent tissue, understanding the transport of LTP-generated ROS in the cardiovascular system, and investigations of other internal disease states."
"9406174","Project Summary 3rd generation sequencing technologies have revolutionized our understanding of the structure-function of the genome and the accuracy of reference assemblies. Transformative advances from Pacific Biosciences, Oxford Nanopore, 10X Genomics, and BioNano Genomics have created a resurgent need for high molecular weight (MW) DNA of the utmost quality and for new technologies to effectively process it. Library preparation for most long-read sequencing technologies requires size selection purification using AMPure beads to remove smaller background molecules (e.g. <200 bp) from the desired library products and separate pulsed field gel electrophoresis to then isolate the longest library products from shorter fragmented products (e.g. <6 kb). However, AMPure has low recovery efficiency (<25%) for high MW DNA, preferentially losing the longest, most desired DNA molecules while PFGE instruments such as Sage Science's BluePippin are very slow (8 hours) and also damage DNA during the long PFGE process, necessitating subsequent enzymatic repair. In this Phase I SBIR, we will develop 2 technologies for rapid size selection of both small and large DNA using our Nanobind silica nanomaterial to replace inefficient AMPure purifications and slow PFGE separations with a rapid bind, wash, and elute process. Nanobind is a novel thermoplastic nanomaterial that can be inexpensively manufactured and is capable of extracting higher quality DNA than any competing method. The low shear, non-porous substrate employs a novel tentacle binding mechanism that condenses DNA onto the surface of the disk and protects it from fragmentation and other damage to obtain high quality, high MW DNA. First, we will develop Nanobind Small DNA Size Select with tunable cutoffs between 50 - 400 bp to purify small molecules in enzymatic reactions with high recovery efficiency of high MW DNA. Second, we will integrate molecular crowding to create Nanobind Large DNA Size Select with tunable cutoffs between 200 bp - 10 kb to enhance read lengths and replace slow PFGE purifications. No magnetic particle or spin column technology is capable of size selection in the kilobase range. Finally, we will validate Nanobind Size Select by performing Pacific Biosciences SMRT sequencing and comparing against libraries made using the standard AMPure/BluePippin approaches."
"9315455","In 2015 over half a million Americans ages 12 and older were regular inhalant users. Inhalant use can result in profound neurological and organ damage and use is correlated with mental health treatment, delinquent behaviors and the abuse of other drugs. Despite the scope of the problem inhalants are the most poorly understood and chronically understudied of all the major classes of abused drugs, a problem exacerbated by a lack of resources, relevant technical expertise and validated methods. While our understanding of the effects of a few highly abused inhalants such as toluene has slowly advanced despite the difficulties, emerging inhalant threats have been almost completely unexplored. This is especially true with regard to the abuse of chlorocarbon gases. ?Dusting? as abuse of chlorocarbon gas products is referred, has contributed to a large number of well-publicized deaths due directly to the product effects or as a result of reckless behaviors while under the influence of the product. Alarmingly, chlorocarbon abuse may be supplanting abuse of other inhalants in the U.S., especially in adults, perhaps due to the perception of decreased risk or the fact that unlike other inhalants with strong odors, dusters have no lingering indications of use. The overarching goal of this R21 Developmental/Exploratory grant is to determine the extent to which two of the most commonly available chlorocarbons 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (R134a) and chloroethane engender abuse-related behaviors. We will accomplish this goal through two aims conducted in mice. Aim 1 will use male and female mice to assess the effects of each chlorocarbon on acute locomotor activity as well as if repeated administration induces locomotor sensitization. Sensitization is a phenomenon whereby the initial effect of a drug is enhanced following repeated administration and a characteristic of many drugs of abuse. We believe the demonstration of sensitization resulting from chlorocarbon exposure would provide a strong rationale for more detailed studies on the effects of these compounds on abuse-related neurocircuitry. Aim 2 will examine if chlorocarbons will facilitate intracranial self-stimulation behavior, demonstrating the extent to which chlorocarbon gases positively modulate brain reward mechanisms. Further, by comparing ICSS facilitation produced by chlorocarbons to that of toluene, arguably the most frequently abused inhalant, we believe it will be possible to ascertain the relative abuse liability of these chemicals. To maximize the potential to make predictions and the translational value of our data we will use both male and female subjects and have designed out studies to explore the impact of each of the chlorocarbon gases across estrous cycle phase. Taken as a whole this exploratory/developmental analysis will provide the critical foundation necessary for more detailed experiments aimed at understanding the neurochemistry underlying the abuse-related effects of chlorocarbon dusters."
"9381469","ABSTRACT Human brucellosis ranks third among 8 neglected zoonotic diseases, and is contracted as a result of ingesting unpasteurized dairy products. The Gram-negative Brucella is highly infectious, and is believed that less than 2000 CFUs are needed for pulmonary infection. Infection primarily occurs following a mucosal exposure causing a systemic disease manifested by its flu-like symptoms. Despite aggressive antibiotic treatment, it can still persist in a recurring sequelae evident as undulant fever and arthritis. Brucellae survival within the host is linked to its ability to evade intracellular recognition, thus, allowing them to sequester in various tissues. Although human disease is mostly acquired via a mucosal exposure, few studies have examined mucosal immunization for brucellosis. In part, this is attributed to the inefficiency of oral gavage methods requiring an enormous amount of brucellae to induce an infection. Bearing this, we have devised an oral infection method, termed ad bibitum, that retains the infection to the oral mucosa and draining head and neck lymph nodes (HNLNs) recapitulating natural human infections. Hence, we hypothesize that mucosal immunization of the naso-oropharyngeal tissues will derive the required correlates of protective immunity using our novel attenuated Brucella melitensis (BM) strain. Such approaches will allow for the comparison of which immune cell types are needed for protection and to reverse wild-type (wt) BM infection from mounting regulatory responses in order to evade detection. Subsequent to immunization, the attenuated BM mutant stimulates increases in IFN-g- and TNF-a-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which can effectively eliminate the brucellae. To further these studies, three Specific Aims are proposed.  Studies in Specific Aim 1 will establish a mucosal naso-oropharyngeal vaccination regimen that confers protection against mucosal challenge with virulent Brucella. Studies in Specific Aim 2 will determine which T cell subsets are responsible for protection in the mucosal and systemic compartments. Studies in Specific Aim 3 will establish the role for mucosal memory CD8+ T cells in augmenting protection against virulent Brucella challenge more effectively than CD4+ T cells. These studies will further our understanding of how to induce immunity in the naso- oropharyngeal mucosa, and will aid in devising strategies to circumvent BM' evasion methods. This work will ultimately define what constitutes protection and which T cells are needed to guard against wt BM challenges."
"9411341","PROJECT SUMMARY: The United States is in the midst of an enormous opioid epidemic. In 2015, more than 52,000 American's died due to a drug overdose, over 60% of which were associated with prescription or illicit opioid use. Given that injection drug use remains the major risk factor for HCV transmission, concomitantly the US has observed a striking >150% increase in the incidence of HCV between 2010-2013, and a 364% increase in new HCV infections between 2006 and 2012 in four Appalachian states, most notably in rural areas. As such, there is urgent need to more strategically detect, prevent, treat and control HCV on a national level. This U24 application proposes to develop a centralized GHOST laboratory to generate high-quality, high- throughput HCV NGS data for the CDC's GHOST center and accompanying clinical research sites to aid in the identification of HCV transmission links among persons who inject drugs (PWID); manage the collection and storage of serum samples from HIV- and HCV-infected participants from the clinical research sites under RFA- DA-17-014; and ship specimens to the CDC for syphilis testing and phylogenetic mapping for HIV and HCV. This proposal builds on the investigators' strong track record in generating large-scale Sanger and next- generation sequencing (NGS) data for highly variable pathogens such as HCV and HIV, development and maintenance of robust SOPs for reducing contamination and sample mix-up in large-scale NGS projects, and the development of robust NGS analysis platforms to enable real-time curation and storage of NGS data, downstream variant calling, and phylogenetic analysis. Dr. Allen's laboratory at the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard has been sequencing the highly variable pathogens HIV, HCV and SIV over the last 15 years during which time he has developed a well-established physical laboratory to support all stages of the laboratory process. He has also served as the PI of several viral sequencing cores on NIH/NIAID U01, U19 and P01 project grants during this time, thus providing extensive experience related to the cost-effective generation, curation, analysis, and deposition of sequence data for viral pathogens."
"9329526","Uniquely, using a short-term minimal immunosuppressive (IS) drug regimen comprising costimulation blockade (CoSB; CTLA4Ig/belatacept) + tapered rapamycin, we have shown that maturation-resistant, donor-derived DCreg, infused 1w before transplant, can safely prolong renal allograft survival in rhesus macaques, accompanied by selective attenuation of donor-reactive memory T cell (Tmem) responses, a mechanism that may help overcome a critical barrier to transplant tolerance induction in NHP and humans. We will now ascertain whether a novel, modified, CNI-free IS regimen that is (i) more permissive to extended graft survival and (ii) that we hypothesize will enhance the immunomodulatory function of DCreg, can achieve donor-specific tolerance. There is recent evidence that lymphocyte depletion followed by CoSB (belatacept) and rapamycin maintenance (the 2-drug regimen we used to demonstrate DCreg efficacy in monkeys) can control CoSB-resistant rejection in transplant patients, with reduction in CoSB (belatacept)-resistant Tmem. However, operational tolerance was not achieved. Notably, combination of donor DCreg infusion (a week before transplant) with perioperative lymphodepletion, promotes permanent, donor-specific allograft survival in rodents. This indicates that lymphodepletion after DCreg infusion does not interfere with their therapeutic effect. Moreover, DCreg infusion post-transplant following lymphodepletion, can also promote indefinite graft survival. We therefore hypothesize that maturation-resistant rhesus DCreg, administered to ATG- lymphodepleted, CoSB and rapamycin-treated renal graft recipients, will induce immunological changes and selective attenuation of donor-reactive Tmem conducive to donor-specific tolerance. We further hypothesize that novel biomarker analyses of host alloreactive Tmem responses (in particular, their expression of Eomes) will correlate with and be predictive of safe withdrawal of IS. Our Specific Aims are: Aim 1: To determine the influence of donor-derived DCreg infusion before transplant on renal allograft survival in NHP given combined lymphodepletion (ATG), belatacept and rapamycin (ABR). Aim 2: To determine the influence of donor-derived DCreg infusion before transplant on renal allograft survival in NHP given combined ATG, non-depleting ?CD40 mAb and rapamycin (AAR). Aim 3: To compare the influence of donor-versus recipient-derived DCreg infusion post-transplant on renal allograft survival in NHP given combined ATG, CoSB and rapamycin (ABR or AAR). Each Aim will be accompanied by comprehensive, rationally-designed mechanistic studies that will elucidate the trafficking, fate and immune regulatory function of the adoptively-transferred DCreg and underlying mechanisms."
"9312813","Corneal surface injuries are painful and expose the eye to infections that can destroy vision. During our previous funding period, we characterized a model for the study of recurrent corneal erosions in mice and showed that subbasal nerves (SBNs) fail to reinnervate the cornea prior to erosion formation. In addition, we showed that we could induce SBN reinnervation by treating debridement wounded corneas with mitomycin C (MMC). The long-term goal of our research is to identify the factors that prevent the corneal epithelium from reforming an intact stable barrier after trauma. One factor is failed reinnervation of the SBNs. Our data lead us to propose two hypotheses. The first (Aim A) is that corneal epithelial basal cells adhere to, protect, organize, and maintain the subbasal nerves (SBNs) that originate from the trigeminal ganglion. The corneal epithelial cells protect individual SBNs by secreting a laminin-rich ECM to insulate them from one another, organize SBNs by enclosing clusters of several SBNs within infoldings of their basal and basolateral cell membranes forming epithelial cell:axon adhesions, and maintain optimal SBN function by removing damaged SBN stubs during homeostasis and after injury by phagocytosis. We will test this hypothesis by conducting experiments to answer the following questions: 1. Do corneal epithelial cells adhere to and provide support to SBNs using adhesion complexes and proteins similar to those used by non-myelinating Schwann cells? 2. Do corneal epithelial cells phagocytose axonal debris during homeostasis and in response to SBN damage? 3. Do corneal epithelial cells respond to SBN denervation by altering expression of genes that regulate axon regeneration in Schwann cells? A second hypothesis (Aim B) proposed is to resolve corneal pathology after trauma or disease, adhesion between corneal epithelial cells, SBNs, and the basement membrane must be restored to levels present prior to development of pathology. This hypothesis is supported by preliminary data showing that MMC reduces corneal epithelial cell migration in vitro and MMP9 expression in vivo. We will test this hypothesis by conducting experiments to answer the following questions: 1. Do corneal epithelial cells at the center of the wounded mouse cornea undergo senescence? 2. Can reinnervation be accelerated by treating crush (trephine only) wounded corneas with MMC? 3. Can erosions be eliminated after they form by treating mouse corneas with MMC? 4. Can MMC improve reinnervation of corneas in mice with dry eye disease? 5. Does a prior injury (conditioning lesion) improve reinnervation after crush or debridement wounds? Comparing reinnervation after different wound types allows us to differentiate between mechanisms that permit reinnervation after crush wounds from those that prevent reinnervation after debridement wounds and will give us insight into how MMC enhances reinnervation."
"9411645","ABSTRACT  HIV and malaria are two of the most devastating infectious diseases in the world. In 2015, these diseases together caused over 1.4 million deaths. Although advances have been made in preventing new infections of both HIV and malaria, the risk of infection with either disease in the world?s poorest nations is still great. Furthermore, as HIV and malaria are endemic to similar geographical areas, this overlap constitutes great risk for co-infection of individuals, which could fuel the spread of both diseases. Moreover, HIV and malaria infection have been shown to cause similar gastrointestinal pathologies, including disruption of the epithelial barrier and altered intestinal immune function. As infection across the rectal mucosa constitutes a major route for sexual transmission of HIV, it is possible that prior infection with malaria could increase the risk of acquisition of HIV, should exposure of this mucosal membrane occur. Importantly, as the biomedical research field moves closer to the development of an effective vaccine to prevent new HIV infections, it will be critical to take into account alterations in mucosal phenotype and function that may occur due to malaria infection, as these changes could impact the efficacy of the HIV vaccine. Here, we aim to determine how concurrent malaria infection could alter the efficacy of SHIV vaccination in rhesus macaques. We will assess immunological and microbial alterations in the intestinal mucosa during malaria infection and track these changes throughout subsequent SHIV vaccination and SHIV challenge, in order to elucidate how malaria may alter HIV vaccine responses and thus diminish protection from SHIV infection. These studies will generate critical knowledge of the impact of malaria on HIV vaccination strategies, which will aid in the development of vaccines that take into account environmental factors such as other co-endemic infectious diseases, and thus be effectively employed in the developing world, where the need for an HIV vaccine is the greatest."
"9494777","Project Summary/Abstract Zika virus (ZIKV) infections remain an enduring public health challenge. An accurate test for the early and precise diagnosis of a ZIKV infection is urgently needed to control and to prevent the epidemic spreading of the disease. The proposal aims to identify new and comprehensive serological markers based on ZIKV specific IgM peptide epitopes at an early stage of the disease. The search for ZIKV specific biomarkers will be performed on proteome-wide high density peptide microarrays. To clearly discriminate Zika infections from related viral disorders such as Dengue virus (DENV), Yellow fever virus (YFV), West Nile virus (WNV) and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infections, the study will analyze IgM signatures in ZIKV patient sera in comparison to sera from patients with the aforementioned infections. High density peptide microarrays enable the analysis of antibody responses with unmet speed and precision, breaking down the immune response into immunogenic and specific peptide epitopes with single amino acid resolution. For the initial epitope discovery, a screening library will be used comprising the full proteomes of the most relevant subtypes of ZIKV, DENV, YFV, WNV and CHIKV. The proteome sequences will be translated into overlapping peptides and the resulting library will be synthesized on discovery microarrays with up to 35,000 different peptides per chip. The discovery arrays will be screened in a typical immunoassay with pooled sera of the different study groups. After the primary screening, the most specific biomarker candidates will be selected for further validation on focused second and third generation peptide microarrays with individual serum samples. After final validation, the most comprehensive peptide epitopes will be chosen as basis for a differential diagnostic device which allows the early and accurate ZIKV diagnosis that also enables the clear discrimination from DENV, YFV, WNV and CHIKV infections."
"9357404","Cerebral Small Vessel Disease (SVD) is an important, potentially modifiable factor for clinical dementia. Recent data suggest that the age-specific incidence of dementia may be decreasing, partly as a result of better management of vascular risk factors, lending urgency to dementia prevention trials but a major impediment is the absence of circulating biomarkers for tracking onset and progression of SVD. Brain MRI imaging markers are the current gold standard for SVD but are too expensive and burdensome for repeated assessments. Recent genetic studies, including from the Cohorts for Heart & Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium, implicate microglial inflammation and astroglia in the biology of SVD and dementia. We propose to measure 2 circulating biomarkers of microglial inflammation (sCD-14 and YKL-40) and a marker of astroglial injury (GFAP) in ~17,000 persons (including 4000 minority participants, 6000 with >2 MRI) across 5 CHARGE population-based cohorts.  Specifcally, we will (1) examine the association of the novel biomarkers with (a) previously collected MRI-defined SVD (white matter hyperintensities, lacunar infarcts and cerebral microbleeds), and in persons under age 70, sensitive MRI measures of early, preclinical SVD such as fractional anisotropy on diffusion- weighted imaging, regional cortical thinning and perivascular spaces; (b) previously collected measures of cognitive function; and (c) neurocognitive and vascular consequences of SVD (dementia and stroke). We will use a Mendelian Randomization framework and existing genetic data to examine causal relationships between the novel biomarkers and MRI, neurocognitive, and clinical outcomes.  (2) We will assess the incremental predictive utility of the novel biomarkers over (a) vascular risk factor profiles such as the Framingham Stroke Risk Prediction score; (b) over a panel of previously measured `candidate' biomarkers for SVD including CRP, IL6, TNF-alpha, fibrinogen, BNP, urine albumin, tHcy, ST2, GDF15, TnI, BDNF, VEGF, MMP-9, beta-amyloid, clusterin and APOE and (c) we will identify a parsimonious set of biomarkers that best predict presence of SVD and risk of cognitive decline, stroke and dementia.  (3) We will (a) validate the prediction models developed in Aim 2 in independent samples, (b) extend the biological associations and improve clinical prediction models through hypothesis-free exploration of multi-dimensional omics (whole genome, GWAS, epigenetic and gene expression) and (c) investigate the added predictive value of risk models that combine genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic information over models that consider only risk factor and serum biomarker information. In summary we propose to leverage extensive available data to identify and validate a novel circulating biomarker profile of glial cell dysfunction that will improve our understanding of SVD biology and help in the prediction of SVD and its associated adverse neurological outcomes.  "
"9390295","Project Summary/Abstract  The Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) was established by the Affordable Care Act and requires the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to reduce payments to hospitals with excess hospital readmissions. The intention of the HRRP is to reduce hospital readmissions, which occur for approximately 20 percent of Medicare admissions and imposes a cost of approximately $17 billion per year. While there have been reports of a decline in readmissions associated with the HRRP, there is only one formal evaluation of the HRRP program and that was limited to hospitals in New York.  We will use administrative data from Medicare on hospital inpatient spending and mortality, and two quasi-experimental research designs (difference-in-differences and regression kink) to assess whether hospitals that were penalized under the HRRP responded to the penalties by changing their processes of care. Specifically, we propose to obtain estimates of the effect of the HRRP penalties on inpatient spending for DRGs that were (e.g., AMI) and were not (e.g., COPD) used to assess readmission penalties. We will also obtain estimates of the effect of the HRRP on discharge status, readmission (penalty in round 2), and mortality for patients in DRGs that were and were not used to assess future penalties. We propose to examine the effects of the first two rounds of the HRRP program."
