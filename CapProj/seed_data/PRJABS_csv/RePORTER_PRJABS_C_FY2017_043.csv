"9281607","Cornell's Roybal Center-The Translational Research Institute on Pain in Later Life (TRIPLL) has developed  innovative approaches and an effective infrastructure for the translation of behavioral and social science  research to improve the health and well-being of older adults. TRIPLL maximizes the joint resources for  aging-related research at Cornell University, uniting social and behavioral scientists and experts in  translational research at Cornell's Ithaca campus with researchers at Cornell's Medical College In NYC to  promote translational research on the topic of later-life pain. In this competing renewal application, we will  leverage and expand the infrastructure our Center has built to create a collaboration among prominent  research centers that will promote translational research on the science of behavior change to address later life  pain. This new focus is justified because 1) pain is a highly prevalent, costly, and frequently disabling  condition among older adults, and 2) significant advances in behavior change science are tremendously  promising for translational efforts at this time. New partners In the Center will include the Laboratory for  Rational Decision Making, Healthy Aging Laboratory, and Interaction Design Laboratory in Communications  (located in Ithaca, NY), as well as Cornell NYC Tech (located in New York City). The specific aims of the  Center's Pilot Study Core will be to: 1) foster trainees' careers in translational research on aging; 2) actively  support pilot studies conducted by trainees; 3) supervise a program of Investigator development in the  methods of translational research, including training in intervention research, methodological innovations,  human subjects protection and research integrity, and dissemination; and 4) build capacity for supporting  translational research across the collaborating sites."
"9297232","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of Chicago is requesting continued support from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (hereafter, AHRQ) for the National Research Service Award (hereafter, NRSA) program entitled the Health Services Research Training Program. The Health Services Research Training Program will provide two to three years of support to outstanding candidates from predoctoral programs from both the University of Chicago and Northwestern University, leading to careers in health services research. The University of Chicago has been an ideal site in which to provide broad-based training in health services due to the extraordinary strength of its faculty in health services research and in the social science, biomedical, and statistical disciplines upon which health services research draws. The high caliber of students at the University of Chicago has been a notable strength of the ongoing and proposed programs. These students will now be able to draw on mentors from Northwestern University and trainees from there can interact with faculty at the University of Chicago. The support of AHRQ and the availability of NRSAs for students in the past fourteen years have helped the institution to expand upon the existing, successful research and training programs in health services by making the University more attractive to students with such interests, as well as attracting even more of this institution's talented and promising students into the field. We expect that the renewal of the predoctoral program will continue to strengthen training in health services research at the University."
"9209432","Project Summary (Project 3) Our longstanding focus has been to understand the multiple myeloma (MM) cell- bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) interactions. We have utilized our in vitro and in vivo models of the MM cell in the bone marrow milieu to identify molecular targets and pathways supporting myeloma cell growth, survival, and drug resistance, and implement effective molecularly-based therapies with dramatic effects on the survival of MM patients. Importantly, rather than focusing on individual targets, our studies integrating various genomic and epigenomic parameters have identified gene regulatory networks as the fundamental mechanisms responsible for continued MM cell growth, despite single targeted therapies. These recurrent and important network motifs form functional nodes in the larger regulatory networks, and are considered to be linchpins of disease causing genomic alterations in MM and other cancers. We hypothesize that aberrant molecular networks drive the progression of MM; confer tumor cell growth and survival advantage; and affect clinical outcome; and that disruption of such circuits will have therapeutic implications. In this project, our robust human MM model systems will be used to stringently validate the role of novel regulatory circuits identified to be of biologic/prognostic significance in Projects 1 and 2 or implicated in disease progression in Project 4; and assess the therapeutic potential of targeting these circuits, both alone and in combination with established and emerging MM therapeutics. We will use our advanced bioinformatic analytical methods to identify gene regulatory networks dysregulated in myeloma and a pooled and/or gene-specific CRISPR screen to evaluate functional impact of each component of the candidate regulatory networks (Specific Aim 1a,b); validate the functional role of selected molecular targets regulating MM cell growth, survival, and drug resistance using our in vitro and in vivo models of human MM in the bone marrow milieu (Specific Aim 1c,d); and evaluate the impact of potential therapeutic agents directed against these validated novel molecular networks, alone and in combination (Specific Aim 2). This proposal will thus improve our understanding of the regulatory circuitry that controls tumor growth and progression in MM, and to develop the next generation of targeted therapies in MM."
"9378983","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of the Cancer Biology Program, CBP, is to increase our understanding of the basic genetic, molecular, and biological mechanisms of cancer development and progression and to facilitate the translation of these findings for improved diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventative measures. The CBP consists of 51 Research Members, 14 Clinical Members, and 2 Adjunct Members. The membership spans 14 departments, and 2 centers, with two members from other institutions. The membership has $4.5 million in NCI funded research support out of a total of $30.6 million in total research support. The CBP program is highly productive with a total of 685 publications with 15% of the publications being intra-programmatic and 19% inter-programmatic. The program has been subdivided into 4 interdependent themes: Computational Biology, Functional Genomics, Cell Signaling, and Translation. The Computational Theme uses bioinformatic analyses of genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data to identify clinically relevant pathways for the development of therapeutic reagents or potential biomarkers to be moved to preclinical validation studies. The Functional Genomics Theme uses genetically engineered mouse models and patient-derived xenograft analysis to determine the significance of genetic alterations in human cancer as identified by the Computational Biology Theme. The Cell Signaling Theme functions to conduct in vitro mechanistic analysis of signaling pathways identified by the Computational and Functional Genomics Theme to determine how these pathways regulate cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis. The role of this group is to identify which pathways are targets for biomarkers or therapeutic development. Finally, the Translational Theme consists of clinical researchers and researchers involved in development of novel therapeutics. The goal of this Theme is to facilitate the translation of the basic science findings  of the CBP to the patient. This group aids CBP researchers in determining how these findings can be translated to the development of therapies and biomarkers for the treatment of cancer."
"9294117","The zebrafish is a powerful genetic model of vertebrate development, including kidney organogenesis. Previous genetic screens isolated zebrafish kidney mutants in which nephrons-the functional units of the kidney-evince cyst formation. Work by many labs has revealed that cystic mutants harbor defects in ciliogenesis genes, and thus are relevant to study polycystic kidney disease. In recent years, it has become appreciated that zebrafish nephrons are segmented into functionally discrete domains of proximal and distal epithelial cells, similar to mammals, and that nephron progenitors express similar genes across these species. Many processes in the specification and differentiation of nephron cells from renal stem cells are difficult to study, and today remain poorly understood, due to the complex nature of mammalian kidney development. We hypothesize that the genetic pathways of nephrogenesis will be conserved between vertebrates. The features of the zebrafish embryo enable genetic screens of mutagenized genomes and interrogation of genetic pathways with small molecules, which we have used to begin delineating the genetic recipe of nephrogenesis. However, implementing a systematic genetic analysis of nephron cell type formation would proffer a wealth of meaningful new insights ultimately applicable to the prevention and treatment of congenital kidney defects. We propose to conduct a forward screen for heritable mutations that disrupt zebrafish nephron formation, and to use chemical libraries to identify small molecules that can modulate zebrafish renal progenitor patterning. In a pilot haploid screen with ENU-mutagenized zebrafish, we isolated a cohort of unique nephrogenesis mutants. These findings establish the precedence that our screen enterprise can successfully uncover novel mutations affecting nephron cell type formation. We will conduct a large-scale screen, then complementation and gene expression analyses to chronicle the kidney defects. In a parallel approach, we will employ chemical genetics to screen libraries of bioactive molecules with known targets and identify compounds that alter nephrogenesis. We will also determine the epistatic relationship between nephron genes and the known renal progenitor signals, retinoic acid and Notch. Finally, we will clone and further study a subset of the kidney mutations. The overall goal of this project is to establish a genetic toolkit that can facilitate and energize the burgeoning use of zebrafish in nephrology research. A fully annotated interface with mutant descriptions, images, and chemical phenotypes will be made freely available on the Zebrafish Information Network (ZFIN), and kidney mutant distribution will be coordinated through the Zebrafish International Resource Center (ZIRC). These studies will produce a valuable commodity that will complement existing kidney research tools like the mammalian GUDMAP, and foster the use of zebrafish to formulate and test advanced hypotheses that can forge significant inroads into dissecting the genetic pathways of nephrogenesis."
"9403372","Project Summary/Abstract A normal and robust immune system relies on the development of a diverse repertoire of T cells that are tolerant of self-tissues. The thymus is a critical site for the development and education of T cell to promote tolerance to self and thus prevent autoimmune diseases, such as Type 1 diabetes or multiple sclerosis. Within the thymus, the Autoimmune Regulator (Aire) gene is a key player in the maintenance of immune tolerance as evident by its identification as the defective gene in the human autoimmune syndrome Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome Type 1. Aire acts within specialized medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) to promote the expression of hundreds of self-antigens for the purpose of removing developing self-reactive T cells in a process known as negative selection. Recently however, we have uncovered new populations of mTECs that develop from cells that formerly expressed Aire that we have termed post-Aire-expressing (post- Aire) cells. These cells appear to fall into 2 subsets: (1) a keratinocyte-like cell that is associated with Hassall's corpuscles and (2) a tuft-like cell similar to specialized intestinal tuft cells. These cells show distinct patterns of gene expression with intermediate levels of self-antigen expression compared to conventional mTECs, suggesting that they may play a distinct and complementary role in mediating T cell tolerance in the thymus. We have developed a powerful set of genetic tools and mouse reporter lines that allows us to mark, follow and purify these unique cells in order to study their function in the thymus and their contribution to immune tolerance. We hypothesize that post-Aire cells in the thymus represent a unique subset of thymic epithelial cells that mediate the maturation and development of tolerogenic T cell populations. Therefore, we propose to test this hypothesis through the following specific aims: (1) Define markers of cell identity and key pathways of cell development in thymic tuft cells, (2) Examine the effect of post- Aire mTEC's on T cell selection and thymocyte development, and (3) Assess the contributions of post- Aire mTECs to immune tolerance in vivo. These studies will allow us to uncover the development and function of these novel cells within the thymus as well as their contribution to T cell selection and maturation as well as induction of other important immune regulators, such as T regulatory and invariant natural killer cells. In this way, we hope to understand the role of these cells in the promoting immune tolerance and how they may be employed in the prevention of autoimmune disease."
"9470089","This administrative supplement request through the Office of Dietary Supplements (PA-16-319) takes advantage of the expertise of one member of the multi-PI group of scientists on the Parent Award ?Phenotyping embryonic lethal knockout mice with neural crest and neural tube defects?. The Niswander lab has extensive experience in the detailed characterization of embryonic mutations that disrupt neural tube closure leading to neural tube defects (NTDs) like spina bifida. NTDs are a common birth defects (1 in 1000 births) and the mouse represents an excellent model of human neural tube closure and has led to the discovery of numerous genes that control neural tube development and that are now associated with human NTDs. The original goal in Aim 2 under Dr. Niswander?s direction is to delve deeply into the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for defects in neural tube formation in mice arising from the Knock-Out Mouse Project (KOMP2) to better understand the genetic networks that orchestrate neural tube closure. Folate deficiency has long been associated with increased risk for NTD-affected pregnancies. Recommendations to increase folate levels in women of child-bearing age and subsequent fortification of flour with folic acid have decreased the incidence of NTDs by nearly 30%. Yet, still very little is known as to how folic acid acts to decrease the NTD incidence. Moreover, the few studies in mice suggest that there is a range of responses to folic acid fortification, depending on the genetic risk factors, from beneficial to no response to detrimental ? highlighting the importance of understanding which genetic variants and perhaps molecular pathways are favorably influenced by folic acid fortification. Furthermore, despite the decades-long folic acid fortification campaign, the possible consequences of long-term and potential epigenetic changes on NTD risks and mechanisms have not been studied. The request for an administrative supplement will allow these outstanding questions to be addressed. The requested experiments take advantage of two novel mutant mouse lines characterized in the parent grant, one that results in spina bifida and the other in cranial NTD, in conjunction with mouse lines that show altered NTD risk dependent on the dose and duration of FA exposure. Within two new Aims, the goals here are to gain insight into the phenotypic and molecular changes induced by folic acid fortification over multiple generations in NTD models. The ultimate goal is to discover expression biomarkers that may help guide individualized recommendations for optimal outcomes."
"9332147","Project summary: Establishing reliable predictors of viral rebound in HIV treatment interruption is a prerequisite to accelerating the development of effective HIV cure and eradication strategies. The definition of such predictors is, however, complicated by the diverse clinical histories of each infected individual and the variable levels of host immunity levied against the virus, As therapeutic vaccination is considered a critical component of the HIV cure agenda, immune predictors of virus control should ideally also be assessed in the context of the most advanced and potent vaccine strategies available and in individuals with maximally maintained immune function. In Project 1 of this P01 program we will take advantage of having conducted a series of clinical trials that provide an extraordinarily rich sample base from past, ongoing and future treatment interruption trials that, in some cases, are combined with the most immunogenic and promising therapeutic vaccine candidates to date. We will use this privileged situation to test the hypothesis that HLA-E restricted T cell responses impact viral reservoir activity and the kinetics of viral rebound and that additional host factors and viral reservoir characteristics enhance this effect. The hypothesis is based on intriguing data from the SIV model, where Mamu-E restricted T cell responses have been implicated in vaccine-mediated virus control, and our own extensive preliminary data linking epigenetic modification of critical host factors, including HLA-E, to viral control in untreated HIV infection. Together with data from Project 3 and validation experiments in monkey models in Project 2, we will address the question of whether strong HLA-E restricted responses discordantly affect myeloid and lymphoid reservoirs that leads to changes in reservoir and rebounding virus composition. If successful, the expected data will establish markers of successful therapeutic vaccination and effective control of viral rebound in HIV cure strategies."
"9491992","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this fellowship, I aim to study how variable networks of proteins influence the development and incidence of complex metabolic disorders as a consequence of genetic, environmental, and gene-by-environment (G×E) factors. To do this, I will examine metabolic tissues from 100 cohorts of the genetically-diverse BXD mouse population. During my doctoral studies, I examined the genetic bases driving variable development of diabetes, obesity, and other metabolic traits in a diverse mouse population on two different diets over the first 7 months of their lives. How- ever, to understand the causes and  mechanisms underlying the observed heritability in these variant phenotypes and diseases, it is necessary to obtain intermediary molecular data such as transcriptomics and proteomics. These analyses will be performed on four metabolic tissues: liver, quadriceps, heart, and brown adipose. Transcriptomics (e.g. microarray, RNA-seq) has been well-proven over the past decade, while proteomics is still emerging. Recently, SWATH- MS proteomics has been developed and proven in the Aebersold lab in cell lines and yeast. This mass spectrometric technology facilitates systems proteomics on a scale an order of magnitude larger and with better technical reproducibility across broad populations than earlier approaches (e.g. discovery proteomics, called shotgun). Due to the cutting-edge nature of this proteomics technology, and the observation that protein and transcript networks do not tightly correlate, SWATH-MS proteomics is expected to yield many new insights into even well-studied metabolic networks. In Aim 1, I plan to perform SWATH in four tissues in all 100 cohorts, develop protein relationships of correlation and causality (e.g. QTLs), and examine how data-driven networks can explain phenotypic variation, and how they compare against literature. Transcriptomics are being performed and provided by Prof. Williams and Prof. Auwerx (see letters of reference). In Aim 2, I will examine how SWATH-MS compares to discovery and SRM proteomics in the same samples in vivo, and how the distinct peptides that represent a protein may be used to identify posttranslational modifications and protein isoforms. In Aim 3, I will work on integrating proteomic data with transcriptomics and using combined network models to under- stand how a multilayered approach to systems biology can be used to understand metabolic variation beyond what can be seen by transcriptomics or proteomics alone."
"8112391","High density lipoprotein (HDL) plays a critical role in preventing CVD. Inflammation is of  central importance in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Chronic inflammation leads to changes  in HDL [e.g. decreased apolipoprotein A-l (apo A-l) and paraoxonase (PON1), and increased SAA  and other novel proteins identified by mass spectrometry]. These changes are associated with a  loss of its atheroprotective properties. Inflammation also may lead to pro-atherogenic changes in  HDL. We hypothesize that compositional and functional changes in HDL induced by inflammation  provides an important link between inflammation and atherosclerosis. We also hypothesize that  changes in HDL composition may be biomarkers that indicate the presence of oxidative damage  and/or atherosclerosis at the level of the artery wall. To test these hypotheses, we plan to  determine how inflammation (acute and chronic) influences HDL composition, function and role in  atherogenesis in mice. Next, we will test the mechanism by which inflammation reduces the  atheroprotective HDL apolipoproteins apo A-l and PON1, and increases the potentially proatherogenic  apolipoprotein SAA in HDL. Third, we will determine whether local over-expression by  macrophages of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory proteins present in HDL affects the initiation  and/or progression of atherosclerosis in a mouse model of hypercholesterolemia. Finally, we will  determine whether chronic inflammation alters the composition and functional properties of HDL in  humans in a manner similar to that in mice, and whether changes in HDL protein composition are  markers of oxidation and/or atherosclerosis Many of these studies will involve the use of novel  mass spectrometric approaches. These studies should provide important information to our longterm  goal of understanding the relationship between inflammation, lipoprotein metabolism and  atherosclerosis."

"8112394","Mouse models of atherosclerosis provide an opportunity to examine the role of particular genes in  lesion initiation and progression, but the data from different published studies are often difficult to  compare. This is due to the use of different diets, analysis times (primarily very short times), sites of  analysis, and the limitation of testing to a single mouse model. To address these problems, Core A  will use the same protocols for all mouse studies, utilize a diet the mimics the Th1 inflammatory  response observed in human disease, analyze multiple time points including very late stages of  lesion development, and analyze 3 sites of lesion formation for all mice. It will centralize the  generation and breeding of gene-knockout mice, and will perform bone-marrow transplants using  these animals. The core laboratory has also recently developed a macrophage-specific retroviral  vector that allows efficient transduction of hematopoietic stems cells that leads to gene expression  in lesion macrophages in vivo. All of the projects in this PPG will utilize these approaches to perturb  inflammatory genes and ask how these changes alter the initiation and progression of  atherosclerotic lesions. The Core will also facilitate, coordinate and standardize sacrifice of all  project study animals, prepare and blind tissue for analysis, provide histological stains and all  quantitative methods of analysis. The combined analyses using identical protocols will allow direct  comparison of the effects of perturbation of different inflammatory gene products, including  inflammatory genes involved in the regulation of macrophage recruitment and activation and  survival pathways."
"9313557","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The self-assembling process in articular cartilage is emerging as a potentially robust approach for engineering large and small cartilage constructs. The objective of this proposal is to evaluate self-assembled articular cartilage in resurfacing the patella by quantifying the biologic response (i.e., host response to the construct), dose response (i.e., identifying the minimum number of necessary cells), and durability (i.e., stability, integriy, and maturation over a year), as defined by the FDA. Statistical optimization to improve the functionality of self- assembled cartilage constructs has yielded a powerful combination of externally applied stimuli that result in constructs with biomechanical and biochemical properties on par with those of native cartilage. Among a multitude of helpful stimuli, three have emerged as quite potent: hydrostatic pressure (10MPa at 0Hz during days 10-14), TGF-ß1 (30 ng/ml for 2 wks), and chondroitinase ABC (applied at 2 wks), applied in combination. Mechanisms linking these stimuli to the engineered tissues' biomechanical properties have also been elucidated to explain their synergisms and to consolidate them into simple culture protocols. A functionality index (FI) allowing the establishment of quantitative success criteria and validated for the comparison of constructs to native tissue showed that construct properties have attained FI values approaching 1, the value of native tissue. Based on these promising results and additional in vivo murine, leporine, and ovine data, this proposal will investigate the global hypothesis that constructs will show durability without an adverse host response via three aims: The objective of Aim 1 is to use a short-term (12wks), leporine patella resurfacing model to examine the hypotheses that: 1) not only will constructs retain stability and integrity in vivo, thir FI values will be improved by implantation, and 2) neither the allogeneic cells nor the culture products will elicit adverse host responses (local/systemic). Aim 2 employs the murine model to validate that implant scale-up would not alter neocartilage biomechanical properties. Aim 2 will also address certain challenges that are common across diverse cartilage regeneration strategies, namely initial fixation, subsequent integration, and durability against wear; these issues will be tackled using a chondroconductive glue, exogenous lysyl oxidase, and the chondrotuning method that yields robust and lubricious implants. Finally, Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that durable healing can be achieved for up to 12 months in an ovine model. This aim will also identify a minimum cell number that can be employed to achieve effective healing at 1 year. By following FDA's guidance document (Preparation of IDEs and INDs for products intended to repair or replace knee cartilage), and if the proposed study's hypotheses are proven, the results will provide exciting validation of the clinical translatability of self-assembed articular cartilage constructs."
"9385188","While the predisposition to suicidal behavior is complex, the interpersonal context plays a critical role both as a trigger and a deterrent. Moreover, people who attempt suicide display chronic interpersonal dysfunction and an impulsive and avoidant approach to social problems, prompting questions about the way they make social decisions. Although psychological accounts of interpersonal deficits in suicide exist, these are not integrated with neural mechanisms. Addressing this lacuna, the applicant, a cognitive psychologist, seeks to develop an independent research program in computational psychiatry with a long-term goal of investigating neural mechanisms of social decision-making that may underlie interpersonal dysfunction in suicide and other mental disorders. In the laboratory, suicide attempters display a tendency toward short-sighted, negligent decisions and heightened susceptibility to decision biases. This behavioral profile of decision incompetence is paralleled by disrupted decision-related signals in the ventral prefronto-striatal circuit. The literature and our preliminary studies also suggest that decision-related signals in this circuit are modulated by the social context, which can at times counteract goal-directed, adaptive processing. Thus, the applicant?s short-term aim is to test a conceptual model, wherein decision deficits in suicide attempters result from an interference of automatic responses to the social context with goal-directed processes that subserve adaptive decision-making. The applicant has developed a social exchange paradigm, which examines decision-making under disruptive social influences, modeling one key aspect of the suicidal crisis. Her approach leverages formal learning theory and builds on recent computational studies, dissecting social decision-making as an interaction of automatic and goal-directed processes. The applicant will test the interference hypothesis in two cross-sectional case-control studies of behavior (n=120) and neural decision-related signals (n=60). She will use reinforcement learning (RL) models to contrast behavioral tendencies and neural decision-related signals in depressed suicide attempters with non-suicidal depressed and healthy controls. This approach will elucidate individual differences in the degree to which automatic responses to the social context interfere with goal-directed processes. This research will serve as a platform for interdisciplinary training provided by experts in functional and structural imaging (Aizenstein), suicide phenomenology (Dombrovski and Szanto), social and decision neuroscience (Delgado), cortico-striatal circuitry (Frank), learning theory and computational modeling (Dombrovski and Frank), and personality (Hallquist). The applicant will take advantage of neuroimaging facilities and extensive research infrastructure at the University of Pittsburgh. The proposed study addresses the #1 question of the Prioritized Research Agenda for Suicide Prevention, Why do people become suicidal? Examining learning signals (prediction errors) in a social context and social approach/avoidance, this work applies the RDoC framework (Positive and Negative Valence Systems, Systems for Social Processes) to the study of suicide."
"9310021","Project Abstract:  Cumberland County Environmental Health Food and Lodging section enrolled in the FDA Voluntary Retail Food Regulatory Program Standards on September 8, 2014. Upon enrollment, a Program Standards team was assembled at the Cumberland County Department of Public Health Environmental Health Division and consists of the Environmental Health Division Director and two Environmental Health Food & Lodging Program Specialists. The initial Self-Assessment process will be completed August 2015.  The funding will be used to support our efforts and to fund an Administrative Assistant I position who will serve as the Program Standards Coordinator. This role is very important as it will provide the supportive foundation to lead the team in the direction of standardization as we identify current status, next steps, and time frames for completion of the 9 standards. In order to implement the Program Standards in the intended manner, the county must dedicate the extensive time, resources, and staff necessary to meet each standard?s requirements. Due to the overwhelming number of not only state mandated inspections, but also county specific inspection requirements, the feasibility of accomplishing advancement in the VNRFRPS is unobtainable. Cumberland County Environmental Health would require additional staff whose sole responsibility is to lead the overall project?s implementation to meet the following program needs:  1. Identify program areas where an agency can have the greatest impact on retail food safety.  2. Promote wider application of effective risk-factor intervention strategies.  3. Assist in identifying program areas most in need of additional attention.  4. Provide information needed to justify maintenance or increase in program budgets.  5. Lead to innovations in program implementation and administration.  6. Improve industry and consumer confidence in food protection programs by enhancing  uniformity within and between regulatory agencies.  In addition to utilizing grant funding to provide the necessary staff to achieve greater conformity with the Program Standards, the county will require funds for specialized training of EH staff, outreach activities, and deliverables to consumers and industry. Without this grant funding, the County is not able to dedicate staff and additional resources to continue participation with this Voluntary Program."
"9263154","This proposal for the Harvard Biomedical Informatics and Data Science Research Training (BIRT) program recognizes that the field of biomedical informatics is an increasingly relevant, if not essential, field for medicine and research in the health sciences. The practice of clinical care and biomedical investigation each constitute complex enterprises that are dependent on the mastery of enormous data streams. There is a crucial need for trained individuals who are able to integrate, interpret, and act upon the large-scale, high-throughput, and complex data that are generated in the course of biomedical research and the practice of medicine. The primary aim of this proposal is to contribute to the cadre of highly trained independent and successful researchers in the field of biomedical informatics. This proposal builds on the strengths of our many years of National Library of Medicine (NLM) fellowship training. The current proposed program will be overseen and administered by the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and will involve collaboration with faculty at HMS and its affiliated hospitals, including Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston Children's Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, and Massachusetts General Hospital. In addition, the program will work closely with other Harvard University Schools in the university-wide data science initiative, and, in particular, with its Data Science Education Working Group, of which the proposed PI is a member. We meet all requirements of the current NLM RFA, which focuses on those informatics areas that directly pertain to health-related application domains. The breadth and depth of our research laboratories, real-world clinical systems, research activities, academic programs, and experienced faculty provide an outstanding environment to mentor and instruct trainees in all four of the NLM-identified focus areas ? healthcare informatics, translational bioinformatics, clinical research informatics, and public health informatics. We request support for a total of fifteen trainees per year: ten at the postdoctoral level and five at the predoctoral level. In addition, we propose to train four short-term trainees each summer. BIRT trainees work with internationally recognized faculty on high-profile grants and research projects. The program has a formal, required academic component, which includes the Master's degree for all postdoctoral trainees, and the PhD degree for all predoctoral students. Trainees' overall progression throughout the training period is closely monitored. Trainees are regularly evaluated through their course work and through progress on their research projects."

"8114885","Sensitivity to cigarette smoke-induced COPD is highly variable. Many genetic and environmental factors  that are thought to be responsible for this natural variation, however, remain unidentified. Our preliminary  results suggest that the level of elastin in the lung is critical for normal lung development and for timely and  efficient repair following injury. When elastin levels are below a critical threshold, repair is unproductive and  the lungs are more prone to develop COPD. Moreover, we have found that patients with mutations in the  elastin gene (ELN) develop severe, very early onset bronchiectasis, emphysema and end-stage lung  disease. Rare variants of elastin could also predispose to enhanced lung damage by affecting the quality of  the elastic fiber. In this case, minor alterations in elastin processing or assembly could support normal lung  development and function but result in fibers that have increased susceptibility to degradation by proteases.  The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the quality and quantity of pulmonary elastin is a critical  factor in determining susceptibility to cigarette smoke-induced lung damage, leading to COPD. This  hypothesis is supported by preliminary data indicating that both quantitative and qualitative deficiency in  elastin can predispose to smoke-induced emphysema in both animal models and in inherited syndromes in  humans caused by ELN mutations. The goal of this proposal is to uncover the mechanisms by which elastin  defects result in COPD, and to assess mutations and variants in ELN as risk factors of COPD. To achieve  these goals we propose the following specific aims: Aim 1. To test if human genetic diseases caused by  mutations in ELN are associated with an increased risk of COPD. Aim 2. To test whether genetic variants  present in the normal population (a) alter ELN function and (b) are associated with quantitative outcome  measures in patients with severe emphysema. Aim 3: To test if lower than normal levels of lung elastin  resulting from genetic or environmental factors lead to increased susceptibility to COPD. Aim 4. To test if  qualitative alterations in pulmonary elastin arising from rare elastin variants contribute to COPD  susceptibility."
"9304360","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor that afflicts children. Despite therapy with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, outcomes of these highly toxic treatments are sub-optimal with significant long-term morbidity. Medulloblastoma consists of 4 distinct molecular subgroups (Wnt, Sonic Hedgehog, Group 3 and Group 4). Among these, Group 4 medulloblastoma is the most common subgroup but its underlying biology is the least characterized. We have recently demonstrated a critical role for Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2) in Group 4 medulloblastoma. EZH2 is the catalytic core protein of the PRC2 chromatin-remodeling complex, which catalyzes the trimethylation of histone3 lysine27 (H3K27me3) and mediates epigenetic silencing of genes involved in cell fate decisions, differentiation and cancer. We demonstrated that EZH2 is overexpressed in Group 4 medulloblastoma patients, regulates the proliferation and self-renewal capacity of medulloblastoma cells and that the H3K27me3 mark is enriched in Group 4 medulloblastoma patients associated with adverse outcomes. However, the mechanisms underlying EZH2 mediated control of medulloblastoma tumorigenesis are poorly understood. Our preliminary data demonstrates that EZH2 suppresses expression of key regulators of neuronal differentiation and promotes transformation of neural stem cells, raising the intriguing possibility that aberrant EZH2 expression enforces a neuronal differentiation block and maintains pluripotent state in neural and tumor stem cells. The exact gene expression programs regulated by EZH2 in medulloblastoma are unknown and the impact of abnormal EZH2 expression in the cerebellum is undetermined. We hypothesize that EZH2 mediates medulloblastoma tumorigenesis by inhibiting differentiation of cerebellar stem cells and maintaining a pluripotent state. Our objective is to examine the biological impact of EZH2 on medulloblastoma tumorigenesis and test potential novel therapeutic molecules targeting EZH2. To pursue our hypothesis we will first investigate the proposition that EZH2 suppresses gene expression of neuronal differentiation programs in medulloblastoma by altering chromatin occupancy of the H3K27me3 histone core at key promoters. Next we will pursue concept that aberrantly increased EZH2 expression in Group 4 specific cerebellar stem cells will inhibit differentiation and induce tumor formation in the murine cerebellum using a novel mouse model of medulloblastoma. Finally we will test three clinically relevant inhibitors in vivo using patient derived xenograft models of medulloblastoma. Successful completion of the proposed work will determine the role of EZH2 in medulloblastoma and establish the potential of therapeutically targeting this enzyme in clinically relevant in vivo models."
"9479530","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Paracrine Wnt ligands participate in cell-cell communication by activating several different signaling pathways including the WNT/B-catenin pathway which stabilizes cytoplasmic b-catenin allowing it to enter the nucleus and activate transcription in partnership with LEF/TCF transcription factors, and non-canonical pathways that control epithelial planar cell polarity, the actin cytoskeleton, cell movements, and cell adhesion. These pathways can interact with each other, and perform critical functions in skin and hair follicle development and disease. However, the mechanisms by which signaling is limited and controlled to provide proper patterning of hair follicle development, and the ligands, receptors and downstream components that provide specificity to Wnt functions in the skin are incompletely identified. Delineating the components of these pathways and dissecting their mechanisms of action will be critical for developing strategies for skin and hair follicle regeneration in cases of congenital absence or loss, and for the treatment of hair growth disorders and epidermal tumors. To determine the mechanisms by which WNT/b-catenin signaling is controlled and patterned in the skin, uncover novel functions of non-canonical Wnt signaling, and identify receptors mediating these pathways, we will: (1) Identify secreted inhibitors that limit WNT/B-catenin pathway activity and pattern hair follicle development in embryonic skin; (2) Determine whether the non-canonical Wnt pathway components Daam1 and Daam2 act downstream of Wnt5a and control proliferation and hair follicle stem cell maintenance by regulating the actin cytoskeleton; (3) Test the hypothesis that the closely related Wnt receptors Fzd1 and Fzd2 mediate both b-catenin-dependent and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways in developing and hair follicles and epidermis."
"9261209","Project Summary/ Abstract The gradual loss of insulin-producing beta cells of the endocrine pancreas is common to all forms of diabetes. Elucidating transcriptional complexes that increase our understanding of underlying mechanisms governing pancreatic beta-cell development and function is critical for the development of novel therapeutics that will improve beta-cell function. Loss- and gain-of-function mouse studies have demonstrated critical roles of transcription factors in regulating the establishment and function of beta cells. Preliminary data from our lab and others suggest Lhx1, a LIM-homeodomain transcription factor, is expressed and functions in the developing and adult pancreas. Over the next three years, I propose to investigate in detail the role of Lhx1 in regulating beta-cell development and function using beta cell lines as well as a newly developed conditional knockout model. I hypothesize that Lhx1 is a regulator of endocrine cell development and function. In Aim 1, I will characterize Lhx1 expression at specific developmental and postnatal stages. In Aim 2, I will determine Lhx1 gene regulatory mechanisms in beta cells. In Aim 3, I will characterize the effects of Lhx1 ablation in the developing and adult pancreas using pancreas-specific cre/lox knockout approaches."
"8114842","The Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is regulated by and involved in control of Ca cycling in the myocardium and has been implicated in transcriptional regulation leading to cardiac hypertrophy. CaMKIIdelta is the predominant cardiac isoform and splice variants lacking (delta-c) or containing (delta-B) a nuclear localization signal are both expressed in cardiomyocytes. The functional significance of the existence of both cytoplasmic (delta-c) and nuclear (delta-B) CaMKII subunits in the heart, and the nature of the Ca signals that activate them, remain unknown. The Ca involved in E-C coupling is released from the sarcopiasmic reticulum (SR), but cardiomyocytes also contain inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (InsP3) receptor regulated Ca stores. Ligands for receptors that activate  phospholipase C (PLC)-mediated InsP3 formation are established activators of hypertrophy, but a signaling role for InsP3 has not been demonstrated. We hypothesize that local Ca release from perinuclear InsP3 sensitive stores activates CaMKII and regulates gene expression and hypertrophy through effects on HDAC/MEF2 or other transcriptional pathways. Studies proposed in Aim #1 examine the effects of deletion of the type 2 and type 3 InsP3 receptor (InsP3Rs) or CaMKIIdelta on the development of physiological and pathological hypertrophy and failure induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAG) or agonist infusion, assessing changes in echocardiographic parameters, left ventricle to body weight ratio, ventricular myocyte size, gene expression and protein phosphorylation. In Aim #2 we determine whether localized Ca release from InsP3 sensitive Ca stores preferentially activates  nuclear CaMKIIdelta while stimuli that lead to global increases in cytosolic Ca via release from the SR activate the cytoplasmic CaMKIIdelta. CaMKII activation in these compartments and the activation of delta-B versus delta-c CaMKII will be examined by cell fractionation and immunoblotting, as well as by development of a FRET based CaMKII activity reporter (CaMKAR). In Aim #3 we examine a further corollary to this hypothesis i.e, that the nuclear vs. cytosolic localization of CaMKIIdelta targets different substrates. Proposed studies are directed at establishing whether there are distinct roles for nuclear and cytoplasmic CaMKII in activating MEF2/SRF gene expression, HDAC kinase activity, HDAC phosphorylation and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, versus in phosphorylation of RyR and other SR proteins. This hypothesis is also tested in vivo using mice in which delta-B and delta-c subunits are individually targeted for  knockout. Aim #4 considers an intriguing but unexplored possibility for feedback regulation i.e, in the ability of CaMKII to regulate both an InsP3 kinase and an InsP3 5' phosphatase involved in metabolism of InsP3. The possibility that CaMKII regulates these enzymes in cardiomyocytes will be examined by direct expression and phosphorylation assays, and by measuring InsP3 accumulation. Biochemical assays and a FRET based InsP3 sensor will be utilized to examine changes in InsP3 metabolism.  Aim #4 also uses these methods to compare agonist induced InsP3 formation in atrial versus ventricular cardiomyocytes and alterations that accompany heart failure, and considers the question of whether and how InsP3 levels increase in the nuclear compartment."
"9403688","PROJECT SUMMARY This revised R01 application is submitted in response to PAR-14-309 and seeks to understand the mechanisms by which a microRNA enriched in cortical parvalbumin-expressing (PV) GABAergic interneurons regulates the activity of these cells and behaviors under their control. In prefrontal cortex (PFC), microRNA-206 (miR-206) is highly enriched in PV interneurons and its expression levels in post-mortem PFC correlate with psychosis in schizophrenia and bipolar patients. In exciting preliminary data, we show that newly generated miR-206 knockout mice demonstrate cellular and cognitive deficits consistent with the hypothesis that this microRNA regulates PV interneuron function in PFC. The goals of this proposal are threefold: First, cellular and behavioral abnormalities in miR-206 KO mice, and in KO mice in which miR-206 expression has been ?rescued? in cortical PV interneurons, will be assessed. To accomplish this Aim we have generated miR-206 knockout mice that express Cre recombinase in PV neurons. We will use a Cre-dependent expression vector to re-express the otherwise deleted miRNA in cortical PV interneurons. We will then assess the strength of synaptic connectivity between cortical PV interneurons and neighboring pyramidal neurons in PFC of miR-206 KO mice, KO mice with rescued miR-206 expression in cortical PV interneurons, and appropriate control groups. We will also characterize aspects of cognition and emotionality controlled by cortical PV interneurons in these mice. Second, the intracellular mechanisms by which miR-206 controls activity of PV interneurons, and hence mPFC function, will be investigated. We will use High-Throughput Sequencing of RNA isolated by CrossLinking ImmunoPrecipitation (HITS-CLIP) to identify genes targeted by miR-206 in cortical PV interneurons. We will verify that identified genes are direct targets for miR-206 using 3'UTR luciferase reporter assays, RNA expression analysis and protein immunoblotting. Third, the molecular mechanisms by which miR- 206 controls activity of PV interneurons, and hence mPFC function, will be investigated. Specifically, we will use in vivo CRISPR technology to delete the most promising genes targeted by miR-206 in PV interneurons and assess the behavioral consequences. The cutting-edge experiments proposed in this application will facilitate greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which cortical PV interneuron activity is regulated and may yield new insights into the pathophysiology of PV interneuron-related psychiatric disorders."
"9357924","ABSTRACT Impairments following stroke make it one of the leading causes of disability. Many individuals with stroke do not recover complete function of the upper limb at time of discharge from clinical services . Moreover, early stage improvements may wane following the cessation of formal therapies. Regaining as much upper limb function as possible is important, as even mild impairments are associated with limitations in daily function and lower health- related quality of life. Thus, finding ways to augment functional mobility is important. The overarching purpose of this project is to use portable technology, affordable for home use, to provide objective feedback on performance of upper limb motor tasks to individuals with residual deficits following chronic conditions such as stroke. Objective feedback serves to better inform the participant of their progress and actively engage them in their rehabilitation, thus encouraging self-management of rehabilitation. Results from a recent survey shows therapists predominantly provide patients with stroke written home exercise programs at time of discharge from therapies. With this static approach, patients have a limited capacity to evaluate their motor performance and no encouragement to refine their movement. Creating automated systems that measure and provide feedback will promote a more proactive approach to maximizing function across the lifespan of individuals with chronic conditions. We propose that coupling smart technology found in readily available smartphones with three-dimensional (3D) printing provides a scalable option to provide feedback in long-term rehabilitation and advances the current standard of care, i.e. written home exercise programs. We will build upon our current research, further developing and validating a novel in-home rehabilitation system using 3D printing technologies, smart devices and machine learning algorithms. Specifically, we will use emerging low- cost 3D printing techniques to augment off-the-shelf smart devices (e.g., smartphones) into functional rehabilitation tools. The built-in sensors and our machine learning apps in smartphones can quantify characteristics of movement and provide actionable feedbacks to users during in-home rehabilitation. We hypothesize that feedback will result in improved functional mobility. We will examine performance changes in common activities of daily living (ADLs) trained with our system. With the portable devices, we are able to go further than reporting the typical time metric and also provide feedback on smoothness of movement represented as a normalized cumulative jerk (rate of change of acceleration) score. This assessment provides information on control of movement, an indication of impairment. Recording normalized jerk over time and across activities is a promising way to assess change in impairment. Overall, this scalable design offers an innovative approach to long-term rehabilitation needs of individuals with stroke."

"9398808","PROJECT SUMMARY Polymicrobial interactions, or coaggregation, are critical in the development of oral biofilms termed dental plaque. Coaggregation of Actinomyces oris ? a key colonizer of the oral biofilms ? with early colonizers is mediated by type 2 fimbriae, which consist of the fimbrial shaft FimA and tip protein FimB. The assembly of type 2 fimbriae on the bacteria surface requires a conserved transpeptidase enzyme called sortase. Although fimbria-mediated coaggregation in A. oris has been known for more than 3 decades, the molecular entity of the fimbrial adhesin(s) required for this process is only recently revealed. It was shown that the coaggregation factor CafA, not genetically linked to the type 2 fimbrial gene cluster, is located at the fimbrial tip, forming a distinct fimbrial structure, and that deletion of cafA abrogates A. oris coaggregation with the early colonizer Streptococcus oralis. How CafA is incorporated into the type 2 fimbriae and how it mediates bacterial coaggregation are completely unknown. Preliminary studies reveal that CafA and FimB harbor a twin-arginine translocon (Tat) signal peptide, unlike FimA, and that CafA shares with FimB a sortase-recognition cell wall sorting signal (CWSS) with several conserved motifs, which are absent in other sortase-mediated cell wall anchored proteins. Furthermore, while the wild-type strain A. oris MG1 adheres to human gingival fibroblasts, which is enhanced by sialidase treatment, an A. oris cafA deletion mutant is defective in this process, suggesting that CafA recognizes a polysaccharide receptor that is similar to that of oral streptococci. Based on these novel findings, we hypothesize that by molecular mimicry Tat-transported CafA hijacks the sortase pilus assembly machine to be displayed on the pilus tip for its adhesive function. We will examine this hypothesis by two specific aims. By mutational analysis of the CWSS and genetic disruption of the Tat translocon, we will elucidate the mechanism of pilus hijacking by Tat-transported CafA. Secondly, by a combination of mutational analysis, coaggregation assay, and genomic sequencing of differentially co-aggregating clinical isolates, we aim to elucidate the mechanism of CafA-mediated polymicrobial and inter-kingdom interactions."
"9322196","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of Puerto Rico at Cayey (UPR-C) seeks funding to develop health research administration capacity. UPR-C ranks 13th nationally as a baccalaureate source institution for Hispanic PhDs in STEM disciplines. But budget cuts (13% between 2008 -2013) and loss of tenured teaching faculty due to retirement (25% 2006-2014) have challenged campus capacity for management of external funding in biomedical and behavioral sciences, and mentoring for new faculty. Recent improvements include 1o new hires that are slated for 2015. This proposal will capitalize on existing UPR-C research management infrastructure and resources for faculty mentoring, to catalyze sustainable incremental improvements in research administration to attract new funding, and to provide new and existing faculty with expertise, for long term capacity to train students to enter biomedical and behavioral research careers. This overall goal will be implemented via 1) Growing competency, policy, and organizational structure for long-term effects by establishing bylaws, assessment procedures, and restructuring research administration services to ensure efficiency and guide institutional improvements in research administration over time.; 2) Increasing faculty productivity and effectiveness in competing for external research funding with a step-by-step pre-award training for submitting a competitive proposal; facilitated by favorable working conditions, incentives, peer-support networks, and mentoring tailored to individual needs, and 3) Improving compliance services for biomedical and socio-behavioral research through coordinated integration of functions between the two units that offer most of these services to most faculty with biomedically-related projects: the UPR-C Office of Sponsored Projects and Research (OSP&R) and the Institute for Interdisciplinary Research (IIR). This proposal is innovative for UPR-C in that it 1) puts in place administrative policy and infrastructure transformations that promote better continuity between appointments of upper administrators, 2) provide a coordinated beginning-to-end mentoring program for faculty in grantsmanship, and 3) is based on collaboration and consolidation of research administration support services between the OSP&R and IIR for greater efficiency and better service. The proposed approach will place administrative support services closer to researchers and students active in biomedical, socio-behavioral research at the IIR, while centralizing final approval and at the OSP&R, thereby increasing IIR's efficiency in assisting OSP&R staff in the preparation and submission of required reports and ethical compliance certifications. The Expected Outcomes will include a proven, model for attaining sustainability in research administration at predominantly undergraduate minority- serving institutions facing similar institutional transformation and challenges."
"9352322","PROJECT SUMMARY Disorders of transepithelial ion transport underlie clinical disorders of extracellular volume, blood pressure, and electrolytes, but molecular mechanisms of transepithelial ion transport are difficult to directly examine in the mammalian nephron. The applicants' long-term goal is to better understand epithelial ion transport mechanisms relevant to human kidney function, in sufficient molecular detail to define new therapeutic strategies. The overall objective of this application is to identify regulators of a kinase cascade, consisting of WNK (With No Lysine) and SPAK/OSR1 (Ste20-related proline alanine rich kinase/oxidative stress response) kinases, that plays an essential role in sodium and potassium homeostasis through the regulation of renal transepithelial ion transport. The application builds on three recent findings: Cl- directly binds to the WNK kinase domain to inhibit autophosphorylation and activation; the scaffold protein Mo25 (Mouse protein 25/Cab39) enhances the activity of SPAK/OSR1; and low potassium diet activates WNK-SPAK/OSR1 signaling. The central hypothesis is that transepithelial ion flux is directly regulated by transported ions (Cl- and K+) through modulation of WNK-SPAK/OSR1 signaling, while Mo25 provides additional regulatory control. The rationale is that better understanding of these molecular mechanisms will allow the design of novel therapeutics with fewer off-target effects. Guided by strong preliminary data, the central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Determine the roles of Cl- and K+ in the regulation of WNK isoforms in transepithelial ion transport; 2) Determine the role of Mo25 in WNK signaling in a transporting epithelium; and 3) Probe tubule physiology using newly developed chemical WNK inhibitors. The approach is innovative by bridging fundamental molecular insights gained from biophysical studies, with the functional physiological roles of those molecular mechanisms, using newly developed platforms and tools to probe questions of transporting epithelium biology. Assays have been established, and demonstrated feasible in the investigators' hands, to examine regulation of Drosophila and mammalian WNKs by Cl- and K+ in vitro and in the fly renal tubule, and to measure intracellular Cl- in live tubules, with temporal resolution; and to measure transepithelial ion flux in genetically modified, or pharmacologically treated, tubules. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to advance understanding of molecular mechanisms of WNK-SPAK/OSR1 regulation in a transporting renal epithelium. The studies will determine: 1) how quickly changes in intracellular Cl- change WNK activity; 2) whether WNKs act as K+ sensors; and 3) the role of Mo25 in transepithelial ion transport. In addition, these studies will further develop recently identified pharmacological WNK inhibitors, which will be a useful tool for further probing the biology of WNK-SPAK/OSR1 signaling in Drosophila and mammalian systems, and potentially serve as the basis for future development of therapeutic compounds for the treatment of volume overload, hypertension and hyperkalemia.  "
"9334908","ABSTRACT  Stem cells interpret mechanical forces in a broad spectrum of ways that can affect their behavior and, ultimately, their ability to drive tissue regeneration. As such, an increased understanding of the mechanosensitivity of stem cells and the manner in which mechanical signaling may be used to drive stem cell regenerative potential will greatly aid in the design of rehabilitation protocols. Unfortunately, there are few in vitro or ex vivo methods currently available which allow for modeling and quantification of the direct effect of mechanical stimuli on stem cell behavior. There is a need to develop an ex vivo system capable of modeling biologically relevant mechanical loads on stem cells in order to understand the mechanistic effects of physical forces on stem cell fate and function. There is also a need to accurately assess the effects of different types of mechanical forces experienced in vivo by endogenous stem cells existing within tissues or exogenous stem cell populations transplanted for regenerative therapies.  The specific aims of the AR3T Technology Development efforts are: 1. To develop and test an ex vivo system for the mechanical conditioning of stem cell microtissue constructs and 2. To validate a system of in vivo noninvasive imaging for assessing muscle stem cell responses to mechanical loading."
"9334906","ABSTRACT  While there are many important congresses on the topic of stem cell biology and regenerative medicine, these meetings are rarely attended by those in the rehabilitation field. Similarly, few regenerative biologists are exposed to protocols and methodologies commonly employed in the clinic by rehabilitation professionals, protocols which can serve as potent stimuli to drive functional tissue restoration. Nor are most regenerative biologists exposed to the diverse fields of rehabilitation science. There is a great need for an established platform by which individuals from the fields of rehabilitative and regenerative medicine may interact such that, as technologies are developed and as understanding of regenerative biology progresses, the transition to the clinic may be smooth and efficient.  The specific aims of the AR3T Promotion & Dissemination efforts are: 1. to build an archive of introductory webinars and to develop a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) that will provide rehabilitation scientists and clinicians with foundational knowledge in regenerative medicine; 2. to expand the Annual Symposium on Regenerative Rehabilitation and establish a travel award program to support the participation of rehabilitation trainees, fellows, junior scientists and clinicians at the Symposium; and 3. to organize and hold a biennial Frontiers in Rehabilitative & Regenerative Medicine Advanced Training course with stipends available to support participation by rehabilitation trainees, fellows and junior investigators."
"9315565","Project Summary/Abstract This project proposal is focused on developing an optimal brain-penetrating DNA-nanoparticle formulation for gene therapy purposes in Glioblastoma treatment. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor, but currently available therapies have severe side effects and the disease remains uniformly lethal. Gene therapy is a potentially powerful strategy that has shown promise in preclinical studies. However, effective gene therapy has yet to be achieved in humans due in large part to an inability to achieve widespread distribution of gene vectors and yet tumor-selective gene transfer in the brain, which is required for the highly invasive nature of GBM. We have developed synthetic DNA-carrying nanoparticles capable of avoiding trapping within the brain parenchyma due to a combination of small particle size (<<100 nm) and dense PEG coatings. These systems are capable of penetrating throughout the entire striatum of the rat brain when administered by convection enhanced delivery (CED). Our pilot data further suggests that these DNA loaded brain-penetrating nanoparticles (DNA-BPN) provide much more widespread and increased transgene expression in healthy brain parenchyma and brain tumor tissue in vivo following CED compared to gold- standard DNA nanoparticles that do not efficiently penetrate beyond the site of infusion. We will develop and thoroughly test DNA-BPN formulated with multiple promising core polymers and compare their behavior in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo to gold-standard systems and leading virus-based vectors. Since the first-generation DNA-BPN already appear capable of safely transfecting a large part of the rat brain, we plan to investigate other promising polymers that may provide even higher transfection along with the use of a highly tumor- specific promoter to limit therapeutic transgene expression to cancerous cells. Our hypothesis is that this combined approach will allow all tumor cells, including highly invasive tumor cells that cause tumor relapse, to be selectively transfected, thereby minimizing potential side effects by eliminating gene transfer to healthy cells."
"9246322","Pre-exposure prophylaxis and treatment can lower HIV infection rates but nearly two million new infections still occur worldwide each year. A vaccine that can elicit long-lived protective immunity against HIV infection offers the best prospect to end the AIDS epidemic. While no licensed HIV vaccine is available, the modest efficacy observed in the RV144 Thai Trial raises hope that a preventive vaccine is possible. To improve on this efficacy, a deeper understanding of the underlying immune mechanism of vaccine protection is crucial. Our proposed studies aim at generating critical insights on how to improve anti-HIV T cell function, induce enhanced immune potency and durability, and develop paths to elicit broad neutralizing antibodies. We are in a unique position to address these topics with access to an exceptional set of samples from several HIV vaccine trials and well- characterized HIV infection cohorts. Our proposed studies include assessment of the kinetics of the vaccine- induced immune response in relevant anatomic compartments (lymph nodes, bone marrow and gut) and access to cutting edge analytical methods to generate linked datasets that are ideally suited for our proposed, comprehensive systems biology approach. Our project team is uniquely suited to conduct these studies, as leaders and well-established collaborators focused on HIV vaccine research, translational immunology, systems approaches to understand immunological memory, and immune correlates analyses. We expect that our work will reveal testable hypotheses on the underlying mechanistic interplay between key components of the innate and adaptive immune response that are responsible for protection against HIV by vaccination."

Our research and training base is drawn from across 5 UAB Schools (Medicine, Public Health, Health Professions, Nursing, and the College of Arts and Sciences), including 37 Primary Mentors and 24 Associate Mentors and Mentors-in-Training. Because of the collective expertise of our faculty and the strength of the training infrastructure we have built over the last 10 years through this T32 research training, UAB is very well positioned to train the next generation of HSOER investigators. T32 training will be supported by our extensive research base in three broad domains highly relevant to AHRQ priority areas: 1) Healthcare efficiency and disparities; 2) Healthcare quality measurement and improvement; and 3) Comparisons of effectiveness and safety of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment options (CER). The T32 works in synergy with other HSOER training resources in which our leaders are directly involved, including the National VA Quality Scholars Fellowship Program; the time-limited AHRQ-funded UAB CER/PCOR T32 and K12 training programs; and the AHRQ-funded UAB CERTs. The cornerstone of our program is the mentored research experience, with an emphasis on core competencies and academic enrichment. Notably, 100% of our HSOER T32 trainees have completed the program and 33% have been from under-represented minorities. We have had excellent success in promoting the independent HSOER research careers of HSOER trainees with 83% of our 18 former T32 trainees remaining involved in research and/or academic positions. By drawing on the strengths of the current program and the wealth of resources available to program trainees through the interdisciplinary culture at UAB, the renewal of our T32 will allow us to continue to strengthen and expand our combined predoctoral and postdoctoral HSOER training capacity through targeted enhancements to our existing organization and infrastructure and to seize the momentum of UAB CER/PCOR training programs amidst the vibrant intellectual milieu for HSOER at UAB."
"8112383","There is considerable evidence supporting a causal role for T-lymphocytes, monocytes, and monocytederived  macrophages in the initiation, progression, and complications of the atherosclerosis in man as  well as in experimental models. Plaque rupture is thought to be the trigger event for acute coronary  syndromes in man, and several mouse models of plaque rupture have recently been described. Lesion  macrophages in particular have been implicated in plaque rupture by releasing de-stabilizing proteases.  Notably, there is evidence for continued recruitment of circulating monocytes into arterial lesions in  experimental atherosclerosis, particularly in the rupture-prone shoulder. Moreover, adhesion receptors  may also regulate critical functions of emigrated leukocytes resident in lesions, including activation and  survival. Thus, the adhesion molecules that mediate monocyte trafficking into the arterial wall a potentially  attractive target in advanced as well as early disease.Studies to date of human and experimental lesions  suggest a significant role for endothelial VCAM-1 and its major leukocyte counter-receptor VLA-4 (cc4(31)  in the early phase of disease, but have not examined the role of VLA-4 or VCAM-1 in the progression of  established atherosclerosis or its late complications such as plaque rupture. Since antagonists of VLA-4  have already progressed to clinical trials in other indications, the importance of VLA-4 and VCAM-1  interactions in the progression and late complications of atherosclerosis is a clinically relevant question as  patients are most often identified in this stage of the disease.  We hypothesize that the VLA-4 and VCAM-1 play important roles in monocyte and T-lymphocyte  recruitment to advanced as well as early lesions and that disruption of these adhesion pathways will  reduce progression of established lesions and prevent plaque rupture. In order to test this hypothesis, we  will utilize a recently developed mouse model in which interferon-induced Cre-loxP-mediated deletion of  the ot4 gene can be achieved at any time post-natal. These a4-deleted animals will be studied in both the  ApoE-/- (Aim 1) and LDRL-/- (Aim 2) background, allowing us to define for the first time the contribution of  VLA-4 in the progression of established lesions and plaque rupture as well as in lesion initiation. To  complement the VLA-4 studies, we will also examine the role of VCAM-1 in lesion initiation/progression in  a model of conditional knockout of endothelial VCAM-1 (Aim 3)."

"9310031","VERMONT DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH - FOOD AND LODGING PROGRAM Advancing Conformance with the Voluntary National Retail Food Regulatory Program Standards Vermont is a small New England state with a population of approximately 620,000 people. The Vermont food landscape is diverse, with many small producers and retail establishments selling and preparing local products from farm to table. The Vermont Department of Health (VDH) is the state?s lead agency for public health policy and advocacy. The Vermont Department of Health Food & Lodging Program (VDHFL) is responsible for inspection and licensing of approximately 6,000 licensees that include both retail establishments and manufactured food producers. Inspection activities and outreach to retail food service establishments comprises approximately 80% of VDHFL program resources and work. VDHFL has been enrolled in the Voluntary National Retail Food Regulatory Program Standards (VNRFRPS) since 2012, and has used the self-assessment process and standards as a means for identifying program improvements needed for the inspection, regulation, enforcement, and outreach for Vermont food service establishments. A comprehensive action plan has been developed that serves as the Strategic Plan for the state program. Several initiatives underway and priorities of the VDH Division of Environmental Health Strategic Plan will directly support implementation of the retail standards. The department is committed to a comprehensive update of program regulations based on science, IT system modernization, and shifting toward a risk-based inspection program. The main obstacle that has slowed progress implementing the standards has been personnel resources. VDHFL is applying for cooperative agreement funding for a 0.5 FTE Retail Standards Coordinator to support significant progress implementing the retail program standards. 1"
"9310435","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development proposal will provide for a structured environment with expert mentorship and an adequate subject population facilitating Dr. Jonathan Soslow's development as an independent clinical investigator. Dr. Soslow is an Assistant Professor of Pediatric Cardiology at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. He trained in pediatric cardiology at Vanderbilt University, including a fourth year in advanced cardiac imaging (complex transthoracic echocardiography, transesophageal echocardiography, and cardiac MRI). Dr. Soslow's long-term goal is to use non-invasive methods to improve diagnosis and monitoring in DMD cardiomyopathy and other forms of pediatric cardiomyopathy. This K23 proposal will strengthen his knowledge of physics and physiology, allowing him to better interface with bioengineers and physicists in the design and implementation of new MRI sequences. He will gain a unique skillset in advanced pediatric cardiac imaging, biomarker evaluation, and statistical analysis that will facilitate his transitionto an independent investigator. Dr. Soslow's mentorship team is uniquely qualified to support him in this endeavor. Strengths include expertise in non-invasive imaging and physiology (Damon), specialist in DMD cardiac care and research and general clinical research design and study conduct (Markham), expertise in heart failure and biomarkers (Sawyer), and expertise in cardiac MRI (Raman and Arai). His mentors have a documented history of successful mentorship of junior faculty. The skills that Dr. Soslow will develop during this award, combined with his current didactic coursework in the Master of Science in Clinical Investigation (MSCI) program, his excellent mentorship, and the research environment at Vanderbilt, will set him on the path towards a career as an independent investigator with R01 funding. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a devastating disease that affects 1 in 3500 boys. Despite significant research advances, patients with DMD continue to die, wheelchair bound, in their twenties. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in DMD, but the timing and pace of progression to cardiomyopathy is variable. While echocardiographic screening can detect cardiac dysfunction, echocardiography is a poor surrogate marker of disease. Echocardiographic dysfunction likely represents an end stage fibrotic myocardium that is unresponsive to remodeling therapies. Studies demonstrate that early initiation of cardiac specific therapy, prior to manifest systolic dysfunction, can decrease morbidity and delay mortality. Therefore, a better surrogate marker would allow for earlier, focused therapy, potentially altering disease progression and reducing cardiovascular mortality. Fibrosis plays an integral role in the development of DMD cardiomyopathy. Serum and imaging biomarkers of fibrosis are promising methods to identify patients at risk for an accelerated pace of progression to heart failure. Research has demonstrated that proteins secreted by skeletal muscle tissue, or myokines, can modulate the function of distant organs. This concept led us to hypothesize that maintenance of skeletal muscle mass and function, through the secretion of said myokines, is cardioprotective. Our preliminary data fit this model. We have demonstrated a direct relationship between preserved skeletal and cardiac function after loss of ambulation and have established that DMD patients with heart failure have lower levels of neuregulin- 1B (NRG), a candidate myokine. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that serum and imaging biomarkers detect subclinical myocardial fibrosis and can be used as surrogate markers of disease in DMD. We further postulate that maintaining residual skeletal muscle function is cardioprotective, and that this cardioprotection is modulated by NRG and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). Aim 1 will evaluate serum and imaging biomarkers of fibrosis and assess whether abnormalities in these biomarkers precede left ventricular dysfunction. This aim will have a direct, meaningful application to clinical care in DMD, allowing for early cardiovascular therapy, assessment and modification of this therapy, and evaluation of novel therapeutic agents. Aim 2 will evaluate the interaction between skeletal and cardiac muscle function. The results of this aim will inform future studies to prevent DMD cardiomyopathy, including a study evaluating continued corticosteroid therapy after loss of ambulation and a study on the effects of isometric exercise on cardiomyopathy. Aim 3 will assess the postulated cell-signaling mechanism of skeletal and cardiac interaction by evaluating two candidate myokines, NRG and IGF-I. This aim will potentially lead to future therapeutic strategies in DMD. This project will advance our understanding of DMD cardiomyopathy and the interaction between skeletal and cardiac muscle, allowing for meaningful changes in DMD care and spring-boarding the candidate to a successful career as an independent investigator."
"9396952","Premotor networks, consisting of excitatory and inhibitory input from both sides of the spinal cord, guide the contraction of specific musculature to coordinate refined movements. In these networks, motor neurons are the sole point of output to muscle. Although one major function of spinal inhibition is to enforce left/right alternation, motor neurons also receive a substantial amount of inhibition coincident with excitation drive, of unknown functional significance. Two populations of spinal cord neurons may supply this inhibition, the genetically and anatomically defined V1 and V2b classes. The overall goal of this project is to define the activity of V1 and V2b populations in zebrafish axial circuits during locomotion and identify their participation in motor neuron spike timing modulation or another specific behavior. I propose, in Aim 1, to identify the activity of V1 and V2b neurons with concurrent in-vivo calcium imaging and electrophysiology, along with neuron ablation studies. In Aim 2, I will use electrophysiology and optogenetics to define the endogenous activity of V1 and V2b, assess their functional heterogeneity, and ultimately confirm connections to motor neurons innervating dorsal and ventral axial musculature. The proposed work utilizes state-of-the-art light sheet microscopy and optogenetics to uncover the fundamental role the V1 and V2b neurons perform in locomotion circuitry in vertebrates. These results will help understand the purpose of coincident inhibition to motor output, while determining its source and other possible functionalities of the V1 and V2b interneurons. Overall the work proposed here will expand our understanding of spinal cord premotor circuits, laying the foundation for new treatment options in injury and disease."
"9312328","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Developing neuroprotective strategies for proteinopathy. The lesions seen in the degenerating neurons of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin positive inclusions (FTLD-U) consist primarily of abnormal TDP-43 protein. Pathological TDP-43 containing deposits associated with motor neuron neurodegeneration are the hallmark pathology in over 90% of ALS cases, including both familial and sporadic types. How aggregated, ubiquitinated and phosphorylated TDP-43 protein causes neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration remains incompletely understood. This work focuses on extending previous studies to complete the molecular dissection of the mechanisms causing neurodegeneration in ALS and FTLD. In the previous funding period we characterized a C. elegans model of ALS mutation driven TDP-43 proteinopathy and investigated the molecular, cellular, and genomic basis of TDP-43 neurotoxicity. We identified phosphorylation of TDP-43 at serines 409/410 as a critical molecular species driving neurotoxicity, and identified kinases modulating neurodegeneration by controlling the accumulation of phosphorylated TDP-43. The specific aims of this competitive renewal are: 1) Determine the relative toxicity of phosphorylated wild type TDP-43 and the role of kinase activation in the genesis of phosphorylated TDP-43; 2) Identify the cellular machinery responsible for detoxifying phosphorylated TDP-43 3) Dissect the mechanisms by which Ubiquilin mediates TDP-43 neuropathology and neurodegeneration. The development of neuroprotective strategies for TDP-43 related neuropathology in ALS and FTLD is the long term objective of this work. By completing the proposed experiments we will construct additional models of sporadic ALS/FTLD, address the critical question of whether or not pS409/410 TDP-43 is a neurotoxic species in mammals, dissect the molecular mechanism mediating TDP-43 toxicity and capitalize on this information to develop new translationally relevant neuroprotective strategies for targeting TDP-43 neurotoxicity."
"9307856","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Optimal functioning of the nervous system requires selective wiring of neural circuits, the precision of which is achieved through experience-dependent refinement after birth. A classic model system of experience- dependent neural development is ocular dominance plasticity in the visual system, where monocular visual deprivation in a critical period of early life shifts cortical responses. The investigators have recently discovered that normal binocular vision in the critical period drives the matching of orientation preference between the two eyes in the visual cortex, thus revealing a physiological purpose for critical period plasticity in normal development. The proposed experiments aim to study the synaptic and circuit mechanisms of the newly- discovered binocular matching process. First, single unit extracellular recording, in vivo whole cell recording, and computational analysi will be carried out to determine how visual cortical cells respond to binocular stimulation before the critical period and the role of synaptic inhibition in this binocular integration process. Second, chronic 2-photon calcium imaging will be performed to reveal how individual cortical cells change their monocular orientation tunings to match between the two eyes. Finally, the investigators will investigate the role of inhibition in the binocular matching process by studying the consequence of reducing inhibition, and by studying binocular response properties of subtypes of inhibitory interneurons. Together, these experiments will provide important data needed for a complete understanding of binocular matching. Because ocular dominance plasticity and its critical period is a model system for human amblyopia and strabismus, a full understanding of cortical changes that normally take place during development will have important implications for the understanding and treatment of these diseases."
"9330897","DESCRIPTION (Provided by applicant):    This is a competing renewal application of the Program Project Grant entitled INTEGRATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF HYPOXIA. The overall focus of the Program continues to examine the effects of systemic, cellular and molecular responses to chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH). The overarching hypotheses of the competing renewal application are: a) ROS affect chemo reflex function by recruiting distinct cellular mechanisms in the individual components of the chemo reflex pathway (sensor, controller, and end organ); and b) Long-term exposure to CIH leads to stable changes in ROS as well as cardio respiratory functions and involves epigenetic regulation of redox homeostasis in the chemo reflex pathway. PROJECT 1 will test the hypothesis that the effects of CIH on the carotid body are due to ROS-mediated imbalance between inhibitory (carbon monoxide; CO) and excitatory (hydrogen sulfide; H2S) gaseous messengers. PROJECT 2 tests the hypothesis that chemo reflex triggered sympathetic activation by CIH evokes oxidative stress in the adrenal medulla, a major sympathetic end organ resulting in augmented catecholamine secretion by hypoxia, which contributes to ClH-induced hypertension. PROJECT 3 tests the hypothesis that the ClH-induced irregular breathing is mediated by carotid body-dependent ROS generation and reconfiguration of the respiratory neural network in the PreBotC. PROJECT 4 tests the hypothesis that epigenetic regulation of genes encoding redox regulatory enzymes in the chemo reflex pathway contributes to persistent oxidative stress, and the cardio-respiratory responses to long-term CIH. CORE A fulfills an administrative and coordinating function. CORE B provides centralized facilities for exposure of rodents to CIH, maintenance of genetically modified mice, morphological, biochemical and molecular biological assays for all four projects. Because of the tight thematic linkages across the projects, the total knowledge gained from the overall program will truly be greater than the sum derived from each project."
"9317722","PROJECT ABSTRACT Interactions between sperm and the female reproductive tract (FRT) are critical to fertility. A new paradigm is emerging, based on reproductive studies across a diversity of animal taxa, that emphasizes the contribution of post-copulatory male-by-female interactions to reproductive outcomes. Whereas it is evident that these interactions influence the physical aspects of sperm migration through the FRT, they also include, for example, cell-to-cell signals between sperm and the epithelium that are critical for sperm progression to the oviduct, stimulate ovarian secretions and induce sperm modifications necessary for fertilization competency. However, little is known about the molecular nature of these interactions, how sperm are modified or how these changes influence sperm motility, viability and fertilization competence. Studies proposed here will substantively advance our understanding of the in vivo molecular fate of sperm using the model species Drosophila melanogaster. First, we will use sex-specific metabolic labeling and mass spectrometry to identify novel male and female protein interactions with sperm in the FRT and assess the specificity of these interactions. Second, a refined quantitative landscape of sperm proteome modifications, including post-translational modification, following insemination and after protracted storage, will be achieved using isobaric labeling proteomic techniques. Third, the powerful genetic toolkit available in Drosophila will be used to conduct RNAi knockdowns of novel male sperm-associated proteins, and combined with use of fluorescent-tagged sperm and methods for direct visualization of real-time sperm function within the FRT, to directly assess their impact on sperm motility, storage, survival and fertilization competency, in addition to an array of female traits relevant to fertility. The exhaustive and complementary proteomic datasets generated across various stages of the postcopulatory ?life history? of sperm will substantially expand our understanding of sperm maturation in the FRT and serve as a platform for targeted studies of genes governing sperm-by-female interactions critical to fertility."
"9207534","DIVISION OF PRIMATE RESOURCES: PRIMATE SERVICES  PROJECT SUMMARY Primate Services (PS) is comprised of two functional groups, the husbandry staff and the research support staff. The husbandry staff are responsible for the daily husbandry care of the NHPs in the WaNPRC and they provide the foundation for the research performed here. In addition to providing the husbandry care for the research animals, they also provides animal transportation between the Seattle facilities as well as to and from non-WaNPRC facilities, the sanitization of macro environment within the vivarium, environmental testing of WaNPRC areas and equipment to ensure adequate sanitization has been accomplished and the provisioning of environmental enrichment working with the Behavior Management Services (BMS) unit. Maintaining isolation procedures as directed by the Veterinary Services (VS) is one of the most important responsibilities of the PS group. Since the PS staff need to enter the isolation rooms every day and also need to remove waste and soiled caging on a regular basis, they have the greatest likelihood of causing cross contamination of any group in the Center. Only by strict adherence to the isolation procedures can the pathogens be contained and the colony protected. The research staff are responsible for performing the majority of the research procedures for the DPR. They work on a daily basis with the Principal Investigators (PIs) and their staff to design, schedule and perform the research protocols within the WaNPRC. This not only entails the performance of current models and methods, but also the development of new procedures and models as seen in this past reporting period with the development of the cardiac tether model and Bluetooth ecg system, the fecal transplant procedures, electroporation and long term ART treatments. In addition to the development of new procedures, the research staff also refines current procedures to adapt to new needs that the researchers may have. A good example of this is starting to use restraint for unsedated sample collection and dose administration. Working with the BMS group to train the animals to the restraint device, the research support staff began using the Table Top Restraint Device (TTRD) developed at the Wisconsin National Primate Center or a commercially available procedure cage they have been able to eliminate the need for multiple sedations per day on PK/Tox type studies allowing for a healthier animal and less variables in the research. The PS unit is actively integrated with all units in the DPR and actively supports the WaNPRC mission of providing the appropriate environment to support outstanding biomedical research directed towards significant human health issues and nonhuman primate health and biology."
"9396071","Project Abstract/Summary This is the second renewal on a line of inquiry characterizing the neural basis of cognitive maturation through the adolescent period, a time of critical vulnerability to the emergence of major psychopathology (e.g., schizo- phrenia, mood disorders). Building on the findings from the first two grants using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, and Magnetoencephalography, indicating important specialization in cogni- tive brain systems during adolescence, we now propose to probe these underlying mechanisms. We aim to characterize changes in key neurotransmitters (NT): gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate (Glu), and dopamine (DA), which animal and postmortem models show underlie circuit plasticity and undergo unique changes during the adolescent period. Specifically, changes in Glu/GABA processing, modulated by adolescent increases in DA, affect the excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance of cognitive brain systems, driving increases in the cortical signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) into adulthood supporting cognitive maturation. Our Central Hypothesis is that the relative changes of these NTs will increase the SNR of neural activity supporting the transition to adult level cognition. In Aim 1, we will use Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) at 7 Tesla to obtain measures of GABA and Glu as well as R2? indirect measures of dopamine (DA) longitudinally in vivo in 12-30 year olds. 7Tesla MRS provides critically greater sensitivity than 3Tesla affording significant increases in the accuracy of measures of GABA and Glu necessary for probing changes through adolescence, which have yet to be done. We hypothesize that we will observe decreases in measures of Glu and DA and increases in GABA resulting in decreases in the ratio of DA*Glu/GABA in prefrontal and subcortical regions. In Aim 2, we will inves- tigate the association between relative NT changes and systems level effects on known developmental changes in brain connectivity using resting state connectivity and measures of white matter integrity. We propose that NT systems changes will be associated with greater network integration and changes in the strength of corticosub- cortical connectivity through adolescence. Lastly, in Aim 3 we propose to characterize changes in SNR in the context of developmental improvements in higher-order executive function using a task that probes learning and working memory, functions that are known to show important improvements through adolescence. Together, these findings have relevance in elucidating the relative contributions of different NT systems to brain matura- tional processes providing novel insight into the neurobiological basis of normative neurocognitive development that is critical for identifying vulnerabilities for abnormal development that can lead to psychopathology."
"9285737","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As loss of cell cycle regulation is a hallmark of carcinogenesis, identifying novel therapeutic targets aimed at restoring growth control is an important approach to cancer therapy. Endometrial cancer (ECA) is the most common gynecologic malignancy in the US with 49,470 new cases and over 8,190 deaths estimated for 2013. The major objectives of this proposal address mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of estrogen (E2)- induced Type I ECA (85% of ECAs) and a new potential therapy for this disease that involves inhibiting degradation of the tumor suppressor, p27kip1 (p27), a key cell cycle protein that arrests cell proliferation. We reported that E2 induces ubiquitin-mediated degradation of nuclear p27 by its specific E3 ligase, SCF- Skp2/Cks1, in endometrial epithelial (EECs) and ECA cells with increased cell proliferation. Conversely, progesterone (Pg; a therapy for low grade ECA) as well as TGF-ß, increase p27 in the nucleus and inhibit cell proliferation by preventing p27 degradation. Therefore, we provide compelling evidence that p27 is a key target for growth regulation in the endometrium and in endometrial carcinogenesis. We have identified novel small molecule inhibitors of Skp2/Cks1 (Skp2E3LIs) that only increase nuclear p27, which is critical since cytoplasmic p27 mediated migration/metastasis. Furthermore, Skp2E3LIs block both E2-induced degradation of nuclear p27 and proliferation in vitro in ECA cells and {in vivo in mouse EECs}. Importantly, Skp2E3LIs have the potential to be a major therapeutic advancement over current general proteasome inhibitors that indiscriminately block protein degradation including oncogenes. Whereas Skp2/Cks1 causes p27 degradation, the E3 ligase APC/Cdh1 targets Cks1/Skp2 for destruction leaving p27 intact. Interestingly, we show that E2 decreases Cdh1and thereby increases Skp2/Cks1 for p27 degradation whereas Pg and TGF-ß increase Cdh1 to increase nuclear p27. Therefore, p27 degradation can be inhibited both, by increasing Cdh1 or by blocking Skp2. As such, we will test two main hypotheses: 1. that the Cdh1-Skp2/Cks1-p27axis is important in cell cycle dysregulation by the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS); 2. that Skp2E3LIs have significant translational value for the treatment of ECA. We propose to: 1. Use E2, Pg, and TGF-ß as molecular switches to learn how Cdh1 is controlled to affect p27 levels. 2. Show that co-localization of p27 and Cdh1 in human biopsy tissue is a biomarker for positive outcomes of Pg therapy. {3. Perform co-crystallization/NMR structural analysis of Skp2-Cks1-Skp2E3LI complexes for chemically optimizing current lead compounds to define the role of p27 in ECA in vitro and in vivo.} 4. Quantify the effects of Skp2E3LIs on intracellular [nuclear] trafficking of p27 Skp2, and Cks1 together with cell cycle analysis by single cell imaging microscopy. 5. Test Skp2E3LIs for their efficacy in blocking the growth of human ECA tumors in mouse models. As the degradation of nuclear p27 occurs in numerous cancers, our studies should impact the cancer biology field by providing mechanistic insights into the role of the UPS in cancer and the use of Skp2E3LIs as a novel approach to cancer therapy."
"9366824","PROJECT SUMMARY  The overarching goal of the proposed research is to improve our understanding of the neurobiological basis of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). In this project we will analyze sequencing data collected from tens of thousands of individuals with and without ASD, and examine the rate at which gene knockouts (mutations that disrupt both functional copies of a gene) occur. Gene knockouts, while rare, can reveal critical biological pathways that teach us about the basis of disease.  We will compare and contrast rates and patterns of these knockouts between cases and controls, study the effect of gender, and relate these patterns to the known preponderance of males with ASD. We will also use this data to generate a catalog of specific genes that are knocked out more frequently in individuals with ASD than in the general population. Finally, from this catalog, the strongest gene candidates will be chosen for neurobiological functional studies, to provide insight into how dysfunction may alter brain development and plasticity in autistic individuals."
"9289824","Project Summary Staphylococci and C. albicans are the most frequent combination of organisms isolated from polymicrobial infections. The ability of C. albicans and S. aureus to cause disease largely depends on their ability to form biofilms and alter their transcriptome in response to different stresses to ensure survival in the host. Changes in the transcriptional network also ensure that these organisms can grow in tissues and survive stresses inflicted upon them by cells of the innate immune system. Significantly, enhanced in vitro tolerance to antimicrobials in C. albicans and staphylococci mixed biofilms has been reported. Consequently, in addition to formation of enhanced and persistent biofilms, co-infection with S. aureus and C. albicans may influence gene expression, in turn impacting virulence and drug resistance. Therefore, it has become imperative to elucidate the unique interactions between these pathogens within polymicrobial biofilms in vivo with the goal of providing overall insights into the dynamics of how mixed- microbial populations are established and regulated in the human body. To that end, we developed a practical and clinically-relevant subcutaneous catheter mouse model to characterize the molecular interplay between S. aureus and C. albicans as they co- infect a host by performing comparative transcriptomics analysis of single and mixed- species biofilms. Further, we designed feasible non-invasive bioluminescence imaging and intravital microscopy systems as tools, which we will use to elucidate the mechanisms of biofilm formation and development of drug resistance under in vivo conditions. Our central hypothesis is that the regulatory and transcriptional pathways uniquely expressed during in vivo-grown polymicrobial biofilms of C. albicans and S. aureus identify microbial phenotypes of enhanced pathogenic potential central to the persistence and antimicrobial resistance of biofilm-associated polymicrobial infections."
"9386379","PROJECT SUMMARY Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, is a serious and escalating health threat in the United States, affecting at least 2-5% of the population, with a rising incidence paralleling the obesity epidemic. There are no effective medical treatments. NASH is a ?silent? liver disease characterized by hepatic accumulation of fat accompanied by inflammation and hepatocellular injury (?ballooning?). NASH is a progressive disease that can culminate in cirrhosis and a heightened risk of primary liver cancer. It is the second leading cause of liver failure and will supplant hepatitis C as the primary indication for liver transplantation by 2020. The accelerating impact of NASH underscores the urgent need to develop novel therapies that prevent progression or, in advanced stages, reverses inflammation, injury and fibrosis. Drug repurposing is an attractive approach to identify novel therapeutics for NASH because it can greatly shorten the drug development timeline. To exploit new computational strategies to uncover relevant repurposed drugs we applied a chemogenomic drug repurposing algorithm in collaboration with AstraZeneca, to identify novel indications for a set of AstraZeneca compounds that previously failed human efficacy studies for various indications apart from safety concerns. Our analysis identified a specific compound that previously failed efficacy trials for a gastrointestinal indication as a drug repurposing candidate for NASH. The compound's mechanism of action would be considered quite novel for treating NASH, and NASH would represent a leap to a completely new disease area compared to the compound's original indication. In the UH2 phase of this grant we propose to perform in vitro and in vivo pre- clinical studies to evaluate the efficacy of the repurposed compound for treating NASH. We will achieve this goal through the following aims: Aim 1) Experimentally validate molecular engagement of a novel drug repurposing candidate for NASH. Aim 2) Evaluate the efficacy of a novel drug repurposing candidate for NASH using a murine model of disease. If the milestones from the UH2 phase are successfully achieved and a ?go? decision point is reached, we will use the UH3 phase of the grant to plan a phase 2a clinical trial. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team with demonstrated expertise in liver disease, drug repurposing, genomics, basic and clinical analysis of liver disease, clinical trials, and pharmaceutic drug development. The team capabilities and expertise along with the established collaboration between Mount Sinai and AstraZeneca provide a seamless path to move from pre-clinical studies directly to human clinical trials."

Addressing Gaps in the Field. The CFAR Immunology Core will continue to address gaps in the field. Three  key examples of accomplishments to date: 1) Provided implementation and training of standardized  neutralization, binding and cellular assays to national and international laboratories such that diverse studies  across multiple laboratories can now be directly and rigorously compared for advancing the science to the next  phase. 2) Innovation of new assay development and analysis for multiple simultaneous measurements  significantly advancing the depth and breadth of immunological information (i.e. global virus panels for  neutralization breadth, novel analytical algorithms and training for flow cytometric analyses (such as FLowPET)  and multiplex binding breadth assays. 3) Provided proficiency testing for DAIDS-sponsored sites (EQAPOL  luminex, ELISpot, Flow-based, viral diversity and neutralizing antibody assays) Thus, the Duke Immunology  Core investigators have a strong history together and are uniquely poised to tackle newly emerging gaps in the  field of HIV-1 immunology.  Relevance of Core to Duke CFAR. The Duke CFAR has five priority areas for innovative research at Duke  supported by the science and technology offered by the Immunology Core 1) AIDS-related malignancies and  co-infections, 2) HIV and Aging, 3) Latency and Eradication, 4) Mental Health, Substance Abuse, and HIV  Outcomes, and 5) HIV Vaccine Design and Evaluation. The Immunology Core's assay platform and  commitment to innovation is ideally suited for support of the Duke CFAR priority areas and specific aims, as  well as broadly covering the current and emerging needs of the Duke CFAR community of scientists and  clinicians. As part of the overall Duke CFAR Aims, the Immunology Core will provide advanced assays and  technologies to CFAR investigators, provide support and training for early stage investigators, support NIH  initiatives (PAVEG, HVTN, IMPAACT, HPTN, CHAVI-ID, MIG, CURE, EQAPOL, FLowCAP) and collaborative  partnerships with other CFARs, and support international in country capacity and scientific training.   "

"8114878","The long-term goal of this project is to understand how the immune response contributes to COPD. In that  context, we submit that the innate immune system of the airways can provide critical signals for host defenses  under normal conditions but can also trigger excessive mucous cell metaplasia under other conditions. Indeed,  studies of genetically susceptible mice indicate that respiratory paramyxoviruses can trigger a permanent switch  to excessive mucous cell metaplasia driven by natural killer T cell (NKT cell) activation and consequent  macrophage production of IL-13. Moreover, if mice with an activated NKT cell-macrophage pathway are then  exposed to a normally innocuous level of cigarette smoke, they develop a striking increase in small airway mucus  production to the point of respiratory death. The nature the response to viral infection or virus-smoke interaction  appears to be distinct from the traditional view of NKT cell pressure on macrophages or the development of  alternative macrophage activation developed in studies of the response to microbial infection or allergens.  However, a similar immune pathway may be active in COPD patients as well as amplification of the terminal ste  in the pathway (i.e., mucous cell metaplasia) perhaps by IL-13 production and/or responsiveness in airway  epithelial cells. Our new observations prompt us to propose how the immune response may be triggered and  maintained to drive the COPD phenotype. We specifically hypothesize that mucous cell metaplasia depends on  NKT cell activation and consequent macrophage production of IL-13. This pathway overlaps with the one in  allergic asthma, but exhibits distinct features. Furthermore, we suggest that this pathway synergizes with the  response to cigarette smoking and thereby produces more severe mucous cell metaplasia and mucus obstruction.  We further propose that this disease trait is a critical but treatable feature of COPD and may be associated with  distinct biomarkers of bronchitic airway disease versus emphysema or allergic asthma. Accordingly, we have the  following specific aims: (1) define the role of the NKT cell-macrophage activation pathway leading to IL-13  production and mucous cell metaplasia in COPD patients; (2) define the role of the innate immune program of  airway epithelial cells in COPD patients, focusing on auto-amplification of IL-13 action at the level of the  epithelium and (3) define the immune mechanism for increased susceptibility to cigarette smoke induction on  goblet cell metaplasia and airway hyperreactivity in a mouse model, focusing on the molecular mechanism for  NKT cell activation, macrophage activation towards IL-13 production, and epithelial programming towards IL-13  and mucin gene expression. Together, the studies aim to establish a new immune pathway that may normally  defend against respiratory infection but may be skewed to drive the development of mucous cell metaplasia in  COPD."
"8114919","The Cell Biology/Morphology Core (Core D) provides a full array of biologic imaging services to aid COPD SCCOR investigators requiring photographic and micrographic documentation (visible, fluorescence, and electron) of basic and clinical research data. In addition to imaging services, the Core makes available its experience with sample handling and detection systems (immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, in situ hybridization, scanning and transmission electron microscopy) required to analyze gene and protein expression in experimental samples. The staff of the Core will work with project investigators to develop new applications and analyses for data generated in the COPD SCORR. Specific examples of Core D contributions will include assistance to the Projects in quantification of cell types in the populations of large and small airway epithelium and bronchoalveolar lavage samples that are the starting material for the analyses of gene expression, carrying out immunohistochemical studies on the airway epithelial and alveolar macrophage populations to to assess the expression of selected genes at the morphologic level, analysis of bronchial biopsies to quantify the proportion of cell types to compare to the brushed samples, immunohistochemical analysis of the expression of selected genes, cell cycle analysis, analysis of the morphology of ciliated cells at the light microscopy level and of cilia perse using transmission electron microscopy, determination of cilia beat frequency, and quantitation of the extent of emphysema in the models of lung regeneration and to quantify the proportion of parenchymal cells contributed by circulating stem cells."
"9322698","1.2 million Americans are currently infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV). The advent of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) successfully contains viral proliferation, preserving CD4+ T cell counts and prolonging life. However, HIV infection is still associated with significant stigmatization, and life-long cART treatment, in an ageing population, bears significant societal health costs. ?HIV cure? is defined as therapies to take HIV infected individuals off life-long cART. Cure would not only have societal and economic benefits but would also be a critical advance in ending the global HIV epidemic. The challenge for HIV curative strategies is that long-lived resting cells, principally CD4+ T cells, harbor replication-competent virus which can stochastically reactivate. The result is that, for most people, interruption of cART results in HIV rebound within weeks. Curative strategies for HIV largely involve combination therapies, drugs to drive reactivation of HIV and immune-based therapies to detect and clear the reactivated cells. In this study, we propose a first-in-human trial of a novel vaccine regimen which aims to elicit an arm of our immune response, called CD8+ T cells. CD8+ T cells are very effective at detecting virus infected cells. The vaccine regimen called, ChAdOx1.tHIVconsv5?MVA.tHIVconsv3 was developed by our collaborator at the University of Oxford. A previous iteration of this vaccine induced very high CD8+ T cells against HIV. The key features of this vaccine is that it shifts the T cell response to conserved HIV regions that limit the ability of HIV to evade the immune response. In this study, HIV infected durably suppressed participants will be sequentially vaccinated with ChAdOx1.tHIVconsv5 and MVA.tHIVconsv3. We will thoroughly characterize the safety profile of these vaccines. We will also use standardized assays to measure the level of T cells induced by vaccination and investigate whether vaccination has any impact on very low levels of HIV in our participants. Exploratory studies will examine whether we can detect vaccine-induced T cells that target HIV in lymph nodes and also whether checkpoint inhibitor molecules can be used in concert with vaccination to maximize T cell function. The first vaccine study will be followed by a second related study. The second study builds on the first, by examining whether mosaic vaccines (vaccines designed to increase coverage of HIV) can further improve on the conserved immunogen design of ChAdOx1.tHIVconsv5?MVA.tHIVconsv3."
"9297228","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the next five years, the Johns Hopkins pre-doctoral AHRQ NRSA training program will prepare PhD health services researchers within the following three high priority areas: 1) Patient Safety, Quality and Outcomes: This area will focus on the multi-dimensional factors associated with attaining patient safety, quality and optimal outcomes of care delivery in diverse settings; 2) Transforming the Financing and Organization of Health Care Services: This area will focus on expanding our understanding of the ways in which our health care system's public and private financing mechanisms and organizational structure affect the efficiency, equity, and quality of care; and 3) Reducing Health Care Disparities for Vulnerable Populations: This area will focus on racial and ethnic minorities and populations disadvantaged by lack of access to health services (low income persons, uninsured children, residents of underserved areas) and vulnerable groups with complex care needs that often lead to poor care coordination and lower quality care. In the proposed program, we will place greater emphasis than in previous years on patient centered outcomes research and research related to the transformation of the health care system. Trainees will also gain a better appreciation for the secondary use of electronic health records and the role of health information technology in health services research. We will address patient/consumer, clinical and management perspectives. Our three areas of pre- doctoral training build from a common core of course work that emphasizes statistical, measurement, database/IT application, evaluation, and policy analysis skill sets. A significant addition to the program is the requirement of a Practicum that will allow students to acquire experience in research directed toward practical applications. This proposal presents a detailed set of core competencies and learning objectives that will provide important guidance for the students' training. The competencies are based in large part on the recommendations of an AHRQ sponsored national HSR core competencies conference our Department hosted in 2005. Our training program benefits from a large faculty with great breadth and depth in our priority areas and from the extensive research opportunities both at Johns Hopkins and in the Baltimore / Washington area. Our program will offer personalized small group and one-on-one support, mentoring and guidance to ensure a coordinated and cohesive training program experience for each of our trainees."
"9428372","Vaginal and rectal transmission models of SIV/SHIV in rhesus macaques offer potential insights into the mechanisms by which systemic viral acquisition is established after mucosal exposure to HIV during sexual transmission. The nature of target cells infected and the sites of transmission after vaginal challenge remain only partially defined, and even less is known about early events of rectal transmission. To gain insights into the initial targets of infection, we have developed a single-round dual reporter system that can specifically identify the cells infected by the challenge inoculum. Further, we have recently reported that macaque vaginal challenge with a mixture of the dual reporter vector and replication competent SIV enables us to identify small, early foci of SIV replication 48 hours post-challenge. As illustrated in preliminary data included in the application, we have also been able to adapt the single-round dual reporter system to identify the first cells infected after atraumatic rectal challenge. Interestingly, our studies of vaginal and rectal early transmission with the a single-round dual reporter pseudotyped with M-tropic JRFL and the T-tropic SIVmac239 48 hours post-challenge all show a similar preference for the same early target cells, with the majority of cells infected being Th17 cells, and the immature DC being a minor population. This observation suggests that the available target cells to initiate mucosal acquisition may be limited. To extend these insights, we will examine how different envelope proteins and the SIV protein Vpx influence early tropism. We know that later during pathogenesis and general immune activation, multiple cell types can be infected and depleted after infection becomes systemic. Therefore, we will determine early changes in the SIV/SHIV target cells by examining the kinetics of viral spread as the initial foci of infection expands from 2 to 4 days. Finally, as early as 48 hours post-vaginal challenge with SIVmac239, we observe evidence of host responses to mucosal infection including apoptotic infected cells, lysed infected cells, and phagocytosed infected cells. Likewise, preliminary RNA-Seq analysis revealed changes in gene expression associated with the 48 hour foci of infection. By combining microscopic analyses of tissue sections and detecting the cells associated with host gene expression changes using fluorescent antibodies and RNA probes, we will be able to visualize the first wave of host responses to the virus. We will define the who, where, and when of which cells are infected, which cells are generating virus specific alarms, and which cells are responding to these alarms. Collectively, completion of these studies will result in a great increase in our understanding of the cascade of the earliest events of vaginal and rectal transmission including the location and phenotype of infected cells and the innate host responses to infection within the first few days of infection. A better understanding of the earliest events of mucosal transmission has the potential to advance efforts in HIV prevention science. Knowledge of the cell type and location of the earliest targets of transmission will reveal where the intervention must be targeted for maximal impact."
"7901816","Heart Failure (HF) is a common event in childhood with significant morbidity and mortality. Current research indicates that cardiomyocyte apoptosis may contribute significantly to the development of HF. We have recently demonstrated that ROCK1 (Rho-associated, coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1) is a key mediator which links pro-apoptotic stimuli to apoptosis in neonatal cardiomyocytes. Our results suggest a model wherein low levels of activated caspase 3 directly cleave and activate ROCK1; activated ROCK1 in turn amplifies caspase 3 activation, resulting in a marked amplification of cardiac apoptosis. Importantly, this mechanistic relationship between ROCK1 activation and caspase 3 activation occurs in failing human hearts, suggesting that this pathway is a valid therapeutic target. The experiments proposed in Project 2 will further validate the importance of, as well as establish the mechanistic underpinnings of, ROCK1-mediated cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Specific Aim 1 will characterize the role of ROCK1 activation in cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Initial experiments will establish the importance of caspase 3-dependent ROCK1 activation on cardiomyocyte survival and HF progression following treatment with cardiotoxic drugs which induce childhood HF. Other studies will test the hypothesis that ROCK1 activation is sufficient to amplify caspase 3 activation and induce cardiomyocyte apoptosis in vivo. Experiments proposed in Specific Aim 2 will establish the molecular mechanism by which activated ROCK1 induces cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Initial studies will test the hypothesis that activated ROCK1 amplifies caspase 3 activation via post-mitochondrial regulation. Other studies will determine if TAT-based delivery of anti-apoptotic proteins can attenuate activated ROCK1-induced cardiomyocyteapoptosis in vitro, and if warranted, in vivo. Collectively, the experiments proposed in Project 2 will test the hypothesis that ROCK1-mediated amplification of caspase 3 activation plays a critical role in cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and furthermore will establish the role of ROCK1 signaling in response to acquired myocardial injuries which lead to childhood HF. This project will also determine if manipulation of ROCK1 signaling can be exploited to therapeutically inhibit cardiomyocyte apoptosis in a mouse model of acquired postnatal HF."
"7901815","Congenital heart defects (CHDs) affect almost 1% of all live human births and frequently require intervention in order to prevent death. Although the deleterious consequences of such cardiac malformations are usually evident after birth, the causes of these congenital defects frequently involve disregulation of events within the transcriptional programs that control cardiac specification, patterning, differentiation and morphogenesis. Handl and Hand2 are evolutionary conserved basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) transcription factors that exhibit partially overlapping spatiotemporal expression patterns during cardiac development. Handl and Hand2 are initially co-expressed, but following looping; Handl is predominantly restricted to predominantly the left ventricle, whereas Hand2 to the right ventricle. However, both genes remain co-expressed in the aortic sac, outflow tract (OFT) and the interventricular septum. To test whether Handl and Hand2 have distinct biological functions, we generated Hand1-to-Hand2 knockin chimeric pups. High percentage chimeras die at birth and exhibit hypoplastic left and right ventricles, double-outlet right ventricle (DORV), and both muscular and membranous interventricular septal defects (VSDs). The observed phenotypes occur specifically where endogenous Handl is expressed, suggesting that primary defects in Hand-mediated chamber patterning during early heart development is the root cause of these neonatal CHDs. These data support our hypothesis that Handl and Hand2 convey unique transcriptional regulation during cardiogenesis. In addition to differential expression, Hand proteins can also dimerize with a number of potential bHLH partners (E-proteins, Twist-family, and Hey2) providing yet another regulatory mechanism. Our goals are to identify the distinct functional domains in Handl and Hand2 proteins that convey the observed unique functions and to gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanism/s that underlie the CHDs observed in the Hand1-to-Hand2 knockin pups. Specific Aim 1:Will determine if the cardiovascular anomalies in the Hand1-to-Hand2 mutants are the result of alterations in cell proliferation, survival, or specification of the left and right ventricular cardiomyocytes and/or colonizing cardiac neural crest. Specific Aim 2 will determine what motifs distinguish Handl and Hand2 function and how Handl and 2 functionally interact with Hey2."
"7901817","Increases in cardiac mass during normal development are characterized by proliferation of differentiated cardiomyocytes. After birth there is a dramatic reduction in the rate of cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity, and subsequent increases in cardiac mass occur largely as a consequence of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Abnormalities in these developmental processes can give rise to congenital heart defects. Moreover, the absence of substantive postnatal cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity, coupled with cardiomyocyte loss (via apoptosis and/or other mechanisms), contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality in neonatal patients with congestive heart failure. We have generated a number of mouse models which exhibit enhanced cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity during embryonic and postnatal life. We have also generated mouse models that exhibit reduced hypertrophic growth during neonatal life and which are resistant to injury- induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis as a consequence of targeted BmpIO expression. The proposed experiments will use these models to explore the regulation of cardiomyocyte apoptosis and hyperplastic cardiomyocyte growth in the setting of neonatal heart failure. Specific Aim 1a will test the hypothesis that BmpIO expression can exert cardioprotective activity in response to acquired injuries which model childhood heart failure in humans (namely anthracycline cardiotoxicity and viral myocarditis). Specific Aim 1b will test the hypothesis that BmpIO functions via paracrine pathways in the postnatal heart, and will also determine how long ventricular cardiomyocytes remain responsive to cytokine-mediated cardioprotection. Specific Aim 2a will test the hypothesis that inhibition of hypertrophic growth renders postnatal cardiomyocytes more susceptible to cell cycle re-entry. Specific Aim 2b will test the hypothesis that induction of cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity can reverse the adverse consequences of congenital and acquired injuries which give rise to childhood heart failure. The proposed studies will benefit greatly from the organization of the Program Grant application, in that many reagents, techniques and mouse models developed in the other projects will be used here. The ultimate goal of this project is to gain an understanding of how regulation of cardiomyocyte apoptosis and hyperplastic cardiomyocyte growth can be exploited to protect at-risk myocardium, and/or to promote the formation of new heart tissue, in the setting of childhood heart failure."
"9320805","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The South Carolina IDeA Networks of Biomedical Research Excellence (SC INBRE) is a network of three Comprehensive Research Universities (CRU) and seven Predominantly Undergraduate Institutions (PUI) that have been working together during the past funding periods in pursuit of their common goals: to build biomedical research infrastructure and strengthen undergraduate research training in South Carolina, and to promote access to health research careers for all students, particularly underrepresented minorities and economically disadvantaged groups. The thematic areas of SC INBRE are currently Bioengineering/ Regenerative Medicine (primarily at the CRUs) and Cell and Molecular Biology (mostly at the PUI). In addition, Neuroscience has emerged as an additional area of strength upon which to build in the next phase. We have also seen much growth in the utilization of Bioinformatics within the research thematic areas and in student training, thanks to  the efforts of the Bioinformatics Core. SC INBRE enjoyed tremendous success during the current funding period. Of the 387 students that received research training sine 2009, 172 were Males, 215 Females, and over 33% were Underrepresented Minorities. Of the 196 students who are well into their post-graduate careers, 46% went to graduate school, 22% to medical/professional school, and 27% hold industry jobs. In the current funding period, SC INBRE faculty and students produced over 170 publications and over 300 presentations, and generated additional grant support for a total of over $36 Million from a variety of funding sources including the NIH and the NSF. SC INBRE paved the way for and supported the preparation of applications for large institutional (HHMI) and Center grants (COBRE) that (all together) brought over $13 Million in research funds to the state. PUIs that have been long-time members of SC INBRE serve as role models to new institutions in the network. In the new funding period we propose to extend the reach ofSC INBRE's support to faculty and students across the state by including new PUIs in the network, and by further increasing network activities and connec across institutions. To this end, we will implement the Developmental Research Project (DRP) Pr complemented by strong mentoring and training and career development opportunities for the DRP target faculty; we will expand research training of students at each network PUI through the Institutional SC INBRE Undergraduate Research Programs; and we will increment the activities of the Bioinformatics Core with an expanded Pilot Projects program. We will renovate research facilities at three PUIs. Outreach to high school teachers and students at selected sites will help tions ogram, strengthen SC INBRE's pipeline to research careers that actively encourages and supports underrepresented minority students and students from underserved areas to pursue a college education and engage in biomedical research."
"9336963","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In HIV-endemic settings, many HIV-uninfected women choose to conceive with an HIV-infected or unknown- serostatus partner. For a woman who cannot depend on a partner to test, initiate and adhere to ART, sex without condoms puts her at high risk of acquiring HIV and increases the risk of perinatal transmission to her child. Daily, oral TDF/FTC PrEP dramatically reduces a woman's risk of HIV-acquisition and is the only female-controlled option for reducing her risk of periconception HIV-acquisition. Understanding whether daily, oral PrEP is feasible for uninfected women seeking pregnancy is critical to reducing HIV incidence among women and their children. We propose a single-arm study to offer daily, oral PrEP for periconception use to 350 HIV-uninfected women in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa who report personal or partner plans for pregnancy with an infected or unknown serostatus partner. Women who become pregnant on PrEP will have the option to continue PrEP during pregnancy. PrEP will be offered as part of a safer conception package inclusive of couples-based HIV counseling and testing. In Aim 1, we will evaluate the proportion of women initiating PrEP and determine factors associated with uptake. In Aim 2, we will evaluate objectively-measured PrEP adherence during periconception and pregnancy follow-up. Level, patterns, and correlates of adherence will be evaluated using plasma drug concentrations and electronic pill caps. Our primary outcome is prevalence of protective plasma tenofovir concentrations (> 40 ng/ml). We will also evaluate median adherence to dispensed pills with electronic pill caps. From formative studies in South Africa, we hypothesize that adherence to a proven intervention (TDF/FTC PrEP) for a defined risk period (periconception, pregnancy) with a clear end point (live birth) will be high (protective tenofovir concentrations at 80% of visits, adherence to >80% of prescribed pills). In Aim 3, longitudinal quantitative data and in-depth interviews with initially high- and low-adhering participants will inform our conceptual framework for periconception PrEP uptake and adherence. Placebo-controlled trials identified adherence as a major challenge to long-term PrEP use. However, women are eager for prevention strategies that allow for conception, and we hypothesize that adherence to a proven prevention strategy, for a limited time with the motivation to have a healthy child, will confer drug levels required to prevent HIV transmission. Consistent with PA11-275 Discovery, Development, & Testing of Novel Interventions to Advance HIV Prevention and Care, this application advances combination approaches to HIV- prevention and targets a population highly affected by the pandemic. This project will determine whether daily, oral PrEP is a feasible HIV-prevention strategy for South African women who conceive with risky partners. Given the repercussions of acquiring HIV during conception and pregnancy, this is an important step towards providing a key prevention strategy to women and their children."
"8107008","A. Administration. This facility will provide synthetic peptides for studies described mainly in projects 2, 3 and 4. This core is directed by Dr. Anantharamaiah, and Dr. Palgunachari will assist in the day-to-day operation of this facility. This core facility has been highly productive and has supported this program project extensively and therefore, an important component of this program project application. B. Instrumentation. The facility possesses three Protein Technology automatic peptide synthesizers and one Advanced ChemTech (ACT 90) peptide synthesizer. While the Protein Technology peptide synthesizers can provide small amounts of the peptides (in mg quantities) in a shorter duration due to the addition of ten times excess of incoming amino acids on to the amino acid-resin, the ACT can provide 10g quantities of peptides but the process is slow since one amino acid is added per day after the completion of reaction is ascertained at each stage of the synthesis. Since the starting resin used in ACT 90 is more, we avoid adding more than the required excess of amino acid derivatives at each stage in order to save costs on amino acid derivatives. For the purification of peptides the core facility possesses three Beckman analytical HPLC and two preparative HPLC units (Beckman and Varian). In addition to this, the core facility utilizes BioRad FPLC systems that are connected to Michel Muller Medium Pressure Liquid Chromatography (MPLC) glass columns. These columns are of various sizes with the smallest (analytical) containing 12g of the stationary phase (C-4 or C-18 silica gel) and the biggest column containing 800g of home made reverse phase stationary phase (C-4 and C-18 Reversed Phase silica gels). We routinely alkylate Silica Gel with various chain-lengths of fatty acids. At a time we produce 2 kg to 4kg of the stationary phase for home made columns. This provides a higher capacity to purify large quantities of synthetic peptides. These columns are also used to purify recombinant proteins. A typical procedure will be described in the Methods Section."
"8106504","The Administrative Core coordinates the fiscal, scientific, and administrative aspects of the Program Project Grant. Although Drs. Goldstein and Brown share the overall administrative responsibility for this grant, their administrative duties are divided. Dr. Goldstein is in charge of budgetary and personnel matters. Dr. Brown is in charge of purchasing equipment and supervision of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Drs. Goldstein and Brown are assisted by their Financial Affairs Manager, Ms. Kay Pokladnik. Ms. Pokladnik is assisted in her duties by a Laboratory Manager, Scott Clark. In addition to their administrative responsibilities, Ms. Pokladnik and her staff are also responsible for the typing and preparation of all our manuscripts, grant applications, and research progress reports. Ms. Jeri Rogers and Ms. Mary Hestand, Administrative Manager and Senior Administrative Associate, respectively, for the Department of Molecular Genetics, draw their salaries from the Department, and not from the Program Project Grant. Nevertheless, they are available to provide back-up support to Ms. Pokladnik and her staff during vacation periods, sick leave, and busy work days. On the basis of experience gained during the past 29 years of operation of this Program Project, we have found that the most efficient and inexpensive way to administer the financial aspects of this Project is to maintain one formal account that is divided into the categories used by the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. These categories consist of salaries, maintenance and operation, equipment, and travel. In the past we have had extreme difficulty in trying to maintain nine separate accounts (one for each of the six Research Projects and one for each of the three Core Units). The advantages of one account versus nine accounts are several-fold: First, with one account all financial records can be kept by one person, Ms. Pokladnik. If we were to administer nine accounts for Years 31 to 35, this would require that a new Administrative Assistant be hired. Second, with one account we can purchase in bulk various items that are used in all six Research Projects and in the three Cores (such as 32P-nucleotides, 3H-sterols, chromatography supplies, transfection reagents (Fugene 6), gloves, micropipettes, etc.), and thus reduce costs considerably. Third, with one account Ms. Pokladnik can prepare a weekly summary of expenditures for review by Dr. Goldstein. This weekly review has proved extremely helpful in preventing duplications in expenditures for frequently purchased items. Although only one formal account will be kept, the overall allocation of funds to the individual Research Projects and Core Units will be made along the budgetary lines suggested by the NHLBI Council. Should a reallocation of funds between Research Projects or Core Laboratories become necessary, this matter will be handled by the Executive Committee as discussed in the PROGRAM INTRODUCTION. The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas maintains an accounting office that keeps a monthly record of all expenditures by budget category and makes certain that only allowable items are purchased and that monies are spent appropriately. The University conducts periodic internal audits that examine expenditures of grant funds as well as other matters. Our last Departmental audit was conducted in April, 2005, and no financial irregularities were found."
"9330187","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ultimate goal for the NIH BRAD project and desired impact of our institutional development plan (IDP) is to build a deeper culture of research at St. Mary's College, and thus to better support the education of well-prepared diverse students interested in research careers. Our Research and Sponsored Program (RSP) office is effective but underfunded and cannot address increasing demands for pre-and post-award services. Our teacher-scholar faculty is talented and engages undergraduates in research, but delivering high quality research experiences for undergraduates is becoming more costly, both in terms of money and time needed to ensure student preparedness. The NIH BRAD award will partially fund an increase in RSP staff and capacity-building activities for research and research administration. The specific aims are to 1) increase faculty research productivity and competitiveness through faculty development activities and improved mentor/collaborator networks, and 2) improve support for research and research administrative services by providing leadership, internal policy changes, and enhanced research administration competencies. The specific outcomes used to evaluate program success will be the following: number of submitted proposals for external funding, quality of proposals, proportion of faculty and students engaged in research, number of research proposals developed in collaboration with external institutions, and amount of staff participation in competency training. The EA will combine the role of research developer and administrator, and we have assembled a strong team to govern the NIH BRAD project and IDP. St. Mary's College is an accessible, affordable public institution whose leadership and faculty embrace diversity, student engagement and research as part of an innovative liberal arts curriculum. Successful implementation of the NIH BRAD program will provide increased opportunities for faculty and students to excel in research. Given that twenty three percent of all our students and 11% of underrepresented students graduate in STEM disciplines at St. Mary's College, increased research opportunities in STEM will affect a large number of graduates likely to enter research careers. To facilitate underrepresented students' transition to the academic culture of STEM courses at our institution, St. Mary's College has a well-established set of support structures, i.e., innovative interventions such as a) Treisman-style STEM Emerging Scholars Program workshops, (b) summer research opportunities, and (c) a system of mentoring, advising, and close tracking of student progress."
"9512473","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Clinical Research and Epidemiology in Diabetes and Endocrinology Training Program at Johns Hopkins University is applying for its second competitive renewal after completing 9.5 years of funding. In 2002 Drs. Christopher Saudek and Frederick Brancati established a training program at Johns Hopkins devoted to clinical and epidemiologic research in diabetes and endocrinology. Ten years later, it remains the only one of its kind in the US. Thus far, we have successfully trained 16 young scholars (6 pre-docs and 10 post docs) who have produced 61 peer-reviewed scientific papers and who hold research positions across the country. During the last funding cycle, we trained 3 under-represented minorities (2 on diversity supplements) and 12 women. Our program includes 3 pre-doctoral and 3 post-doctoral slots, all of which were filled during each of the past 5 years. Following Dr. Saudek's untimely death, Dr. Brancati assumed leadership of the training program, together with Dr. Sherita Golden, an endocrinologist cross-trained in epidemiology. This new leadership team, supported by an Executive and Advisory Committee, proposes a third cycle of funding with the following specific aims: (1) to recruit a diverse group of top-notch young trainees in endocrinology (post-docs) and epidemiology (pre-docs) from a national pool of talent attracted to Johns Hopkins; (2) to enroll them in rigorous, thesis-bearing Masters' and PhD programs in Epidemiology and Clinical Investigation in the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; (3) to expose them to a strong team-oriented, multi-disciplinary clinical and epidemiologic research culture in the Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology, and Clinical Research-the premier educational home for clinical research training at Johns Hopkins; (4) to guide each trainee to an experienced, NIH- funded mentor who will take responsibility for the successful completion of a significant thesis project. To accomplish these goals, our program brings together faculty and trainees from the Divisions of Adult and Pediatric Endocrinology and General Internal Medicine (School of Medicine), the Department of Epidemiology (School of Public Health), the Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology, and Clinical Research, and the School of Nursing. Sixteen mentors will serve as primary faculty and were selected for their expertise, excellence in mentoring, and active NIH funding. New mentors have been added with expertise in clinical trials, health disparities, behavioral science, and community-based interventions. If our proposal is successful, then Johns Hopkins will continue to play a major national role in training the next generation of patient- and population-oriented researchers in diabetes and endocrinology."
"9508978","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glycans on Notch EGF repeats are critical regulators of Notch signaling and thus control the developmental fate of many cell types. Both constitutive and defective Notch signaling lead to disease and cancer. Therefore, it is critically important to determine all factors that contribute to robust Notch signaling. Inactivation of Pofut1, which encodes the protein O-fucosyltransferase that transfers O-fucose to Notch, causes severe disruption of Notch signaling. Pofut1 requires the substrate GDP-fucose that must be transported into the secretory pathway. Mice lacking the known GDP-fucose transporter Slc35c1, and the putative GDP-fucose transporter Slc35c2, exhibit comparatively mild Notch signaling defects, revealing the existence of an additional, novel GDP-fucose transporter essential for Notch signaling. Specific Aim 1 will identify the GDP key-fucose transporter(s) required for Notch signaling in mammals. We will use Slc35c1/Slc35c2 double knockout mutant fibroblasts to isolate the GDP-fucose transporter(s) required for optimal Notch signaling in mammals, define their location in the secretory pathway and establish GDP-fucose transport or transporter chaperone activity. Specific Aim 2 will identify individual and complementary functions of Lfng, Mfng and Rfng glycosyltransferases that transfer N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to O-fucose on Notch, and thereby regulate Notch signaling. All three are necessary for optimal T cell development. Mice expressing a single Fng gene, all three Fng genes or no Fng genes will be used to reveal structure/function relationships for each Fng in regulating Notch1 signaling and determining T cell fates. This will identify critical EGF repeats of Notch1 that must be modified by O-fucose glycans, and the structure of those O-fucose glycans during T cell development. The third aim will focus on a new modification of Notch EGF repeats - O-GlcNAc. We have recently identified genetic interactions between Drosophila Notch signaling genes and the EGF- specific O-GlcNAc-transferase Eogt, and shown that modification of Notch1 EGF repeats by O-GlcNAc is required for optimal ligand-induced activation of Notch1 in HeLa cells. Specific Aim 3 will determine how O-GlcNAc is important for Notch1 signaling in mammalian cells and in the mouse. The effects of the loss of O-GlcNAc on Notch receptor trafficking to, and stability at, the cell surface, for Notch ligand binding, and for Notch signalig in co-culture assays, will be defined. We will investigate Notch signaling defects during embryogenesis and T and B cell development in Eogt null mice expressing only one copy of Notch1. Four O-GlcNAc sites that are conserved between Drosophila and mammalian Notch will be mutated to identify specific functions for O-GlcNAc. The combined results will reveal important new insights into how Notch signaling is regulated by glycans."
"9333918","Abstract Chronic alcohol abuse is a single most major etiology of chronic pancreatitis, a serious inflammatory disorder of exocrine pancreas leading to loss of pancreatic functions and multiple co-morbidities including diabetes and pancreatic cancer. Therefore, a better understanding of mechanism and metabolic basis of alcoholic chronic pancreatitis (ACP) is of great clinical significance for identifying its therapeutic targets for early detection/prevention of the disease. Majority (~90%) of ingested alcohol (ethanol) is metabolized in the liver via alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). However, the inhibition of hepatic ADH during chronic alcohol abuse facilitates formation of fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs, nonoxidative metabolites of ethanol) by several folds in the pancreas frequently damaged during chronic alcohol abuse. These esters are known to cause injury to pancreatic acinar cells in vitro as well as in vivo. Using hepatic ADH-deficient (ADH-) deer mice fed 3.5% ethanol via Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet, we found formation of fatty pancreas and several fold increases for pancreatic FAEEs, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and injury. Additionally, we also found inactivation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)?, which regulates lipid homeostasis via controlling lipid synthesis and ?-oxidation of fatty acids, in freshly isolated human pancreatic acinar cells exposed to ethanol in vitro, and in the pancreas of ADH- vs. hepatic normal ADH (ADH+) deer mice after chronic ethanol feeding. Together, these preliminary findings led our central hypothesis that chronic ingestion of ethanol and its nonoxidative metabolism under hepatic ADH inhibition deactivates pancreatic AMPK? resulting into formation of a large quantities of FAEEs in the pancreas, contributing to pathogenesis of ACP. This hypothesis will be tested by establishing progressive pancreatic injury in ADH- deer mice fed ethanol for 1 and 3 months (aim 1), and that chronic ethanol feeding inactivates AMPK?, promotes increased formation of FAEEs resulting into progressive pancreatic injury in ADH- deer mice (aim 2). The in vivo findings will be validated in primary human pancreatic acinar cells. Finally, role of FAEEs in ethanol-induced pancreatic acinar cell injury will be established by using ADH- deer mice and primary human pancreatic acinar cells (aim 3). We expect a progressive ethanol-induced pancreatic injury in our deer mouse model, and to identify the role of endogenous FAEEs in ethanol-induced pancreatic acinar cell injury. Our project is innovative because we are using a hepatic ADH- deer mouse model (a natural variant of hepatic ADH deficiency) and freshly isolated human pancreatic acinar cells to establish the metabolic basis and mechanism of ACP. This project will be benefited by a strong interdisciplinary team of investigators and their research experience with deer mouse and human pancreatic acinar cell culture models. Overall, our project should establish metabolic basis of ACP and identify molecular targets for an early detection/therapeutic intervention of ACP."

The program is extended by the RFA to include pediatric trauma surgery, and is renamed the Pediatric Critical Care and Trauma Scientist Development Program (PCCTSDP). The goal of the PCCTSDP is to increase the number of highly trained, successfully funded and sustainable physician scientists in pediatric critical care and trauma surgery, who will do translational research to enhance the scientific understanding of the pathophysiology and clinical management of critical illness and trauma, with emphasis on long-term consequences of critical illness and injury for children and families. In the first nine years of the program, 31 Scholars have been appointed, 14 have obtained their own K08 or K23 awards, and 2 have received R01 awards. The PCCTSDP awardees (Scholars) are selected by a National Advisory Committee (NAC) consisting of pediatric department chairs, outstanding scientists, and liaisons from the Society of Critical Care Medicine, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Board of Pediatrics. Applicants will identify an outstanding scientific mentor, potentially at an institution separate from their fellowship training, and will be sponsored by their department chair. Each Scholar will spend 2 years in an intense research training environment, (usually in a basic science laboratory, but research selection is not limited to basic science), with a minimum of 75% protection from non-research responsibilities (Phase I). In the subsequent 3 years (for a total of 5 years), Scholars must be financially supported by their institutions and extramural funds, and must continue to have at least 50% - 75% protection to transition into independent investigators (Phase II). PCCTSDP conducts an annual scientific retreat during which Scholars will interact with the NAC members and NIH staff, present their scientific work, discuss their career development plans and progress, and participate in selected workshops on faculty development, grant writing, mock grant reviews, and other rele- vant topics. Each Scholar will submit a K or R award proposal before the end of the second year of support. By providing extended training and protected time to develop outstanding skills in these young faculties, the PCCTSDP will continue to increase the pool of skilled investigators in pediatric critical care and trauma."
"9388208","7. Project Summary/Abstract  From early childhood, humans have a remarkable ability to help others achieve their goals. Observing someone in need can prompt children and adults to help, for instance by handing back a dropped object or volunteering at a soup kitchen. The tendency to help impacts all social groups, from societies to peer groups to families. The failure to provide help can hinder social functioning and, in some cases, have direct negative consequences to the wellbeing of others.  This research will investigate the developmental origins of helping in the first year of life. Previous research has suggested that helping emerges around 8 to 10 months of age. Theorists have offered three different explanations for why infants begin to help others. According to the natural tendency view, infants have a natural tendency to help others that emerges independently of caregiver encouragement, praise, and other scaffolding. According to the socialization view, infants at first have no inclination to help but are requested to help by caregivers. Finally, the guided participation view proposes that infants show non-helpful interest in adults? activities and that caregivers guide this interest toward helping.  The proposed research combines naturalistic observations and experimental methods to investigate how infants begin to help. Infants will participate in one naturalistic observation and one experimental session each week for 10 weeks. The study will begin when infants are 8 months old, crawling, but not yet helping. In the observational sessions, a researcher will videotape infants as they engage in their everyday activities. The first main question motivating the naturalistic component is how helping situations begin. That is, do infants at first initiate helping situations, as predicted by the natural tendency view, do caregivers initiate helping situations, as predicted by the socialization view, or do infants begin by showing interest in the caregivers? activities which is followed by caregiver scaffolding, as predicted by the guided participation view. The second goal of the naturalistic component is to investigate whether caregivers who provide more scaffolding for infant helping have more helpful infants, as predicted by the socialization and guided participation views, but not the natural tendency view.  In the experimental sessions, infants will have the opportunity to help the experimenter with a new task. Half of infants will be randomly assigned to a scaffolding group and receive encouragement, praise, and other forms of scaffolding for helping, while the other half of infants will be assigned to a control group and receive no scaffolding. The goal of the experimental component is to determine whether repeated scaffolding increases infant helping, as predicted by the socialization and guided participation views, but not the natural tendency view.  The proposed research will improve our understanding of how infants begin to help others by employing a new methodological approach to studying transitions in social development. The contrasting views of infant helping have diverging implications for how adults can stimulate or hinder the development of helping. In addition to informing theory and research about early social and moral development, the proposed research will form the basis for a larger research project investigating how to promote early prosocial development in at-risk populations."
"9333427","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) continues to be a major health problem, affecting nearly 200,000 people in the United States each year. Mortality is high (up to 40%), and nearly all survivors develop muscle loss and weakness during critical illness, termed ICU-acquired neuromuscular dysfunction. This neuromuscular dysfunction is associated with poor outcomes including: increased hospital mortality, delayed liberation from mechanical ventilation, prolonged hospitalization, impaired post-discharge functional activity, and continued risk of death among survivors of critical illness Medications used during critical illness are frequently implicated in the cause of ICUAW, but data are inconclusive. For example, neuromuscular blocking agents (NMB) work directly on the neuromuscular junction and prevent muscle depolarization in response to nerve excitation. As a result, NMBAs can cause functional denervation and ultimately: neuropathy, myopathy, deconditioning, and prolonged neuromuscular weakness. However, NMB may also improve mortality in ARDS by reducing ventilator induced lung injury. Despite much debate about these risks and benefits, a randomized trial in ARDS patients is required to understand the effect of NMB on mortality, neuromuscular function, and recovery. The NHLBI PETAL Network will be conducting a randomized trial of NMB in ARDS, which provides a unique opportunity to study the effect of NMB on ICU-acquired neuromuscular dysfunction and recovery. Proposal and hypothesis: We propose to conduct an ancillary study at five of the PETAL network centers that will leverage the network infrastructure, complement the conduct of the clinical trial, and most importantly enhance the understanding of the utility of NMB for critically ill patients. We hypothesize that randomization to NMB will increase ICU-acquired neuromuscular dysfunction, leading to an increase in neuromyopathy early in critical illness, to impaired muscle strength and function at hospital discharge, and to reduced long term physical recovery. Specific Aims: Our specific aims are to determine the effect of randomization to NMB on development of neuromyopathy early in ARDS, on weakness at hospital discharge, and on physical functional recovery and healthcare utilization at 6 and 12 months after ARDS. We will conduct these aims by performing rigorous, standardized assessments of physical function using electrophysiology, ultrasound, hands-on strength and functional assessments, detailed questionnaires, and in-person follow-up after hospital discharge. We will use state-of-the art techniques for cohort retention and data analysis. With these results, we will definitively determine the acute and post-hospital effects of NMB on physical function. This knowledge is crucial for providing highest quality critical care that is focused not only on survival, but also the quality of survivorship."
"9514496","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stereochemically complex sp3-rich molecules represent privileged chemical scaffolds for the treatment of a broad range of human diseases, often with potent and specific biological activities. However, because these types of molecules are often challenging to prepare and modify, they have been underutilized in compound libraries for drug discovery. Therefore, the development of novel synthetic methods to access these structures in a general, efficient, and stereocontrolled manner is essential. The central hypothesis of this research proposal is that hydrogen bond donor catalysis using small molecule chiral thioureas is a general strategy for the preparation of highly enantioenriched molecules, which avoids potentially toxic transition metals and Lewis acids and obviates the requirement for functionality in the substrate that is capable of covalently interacting with a chiral catalyst. Instead, these catalysts mimic the active site of enzymes by utilizing hydrogen bonding and other non-covalent interactions to effect highly efficient and selective transformations without requiring the larger enzyme architecture. Specifically, this hypothesis will be tested in the development of the first highly enantioselective Prins-type cyclization reactions. These reactions, which involve the acid-catalyzed condensation of linear alkenols (or alkenylamines) and aldehydes followed by cyclization of an oxocarbenium/iminium intermediate, are a highly versatile synthetic strategy for the preparation of biologically prevalent oxygen- and nitrogen-containing aliphatic heterocycles, but have not been successfully rendered enantioselective using traditional asymmetric approaches. The proposed research will employ a cooperative catalysis approach by exploring chiral thiourea catalysts with functionality that is able to engage in cation-? interactions with the oxocarbenium/iminium intermediate in concert with Brønsted acid co-catalysts whose conjugate bases effectively bind to the thiourea to generate a tightly bound chiral ion pair that exerts significant control over the stereochemical outcome of the cyclization. With the establishment of a successful enantioselective method for the Prins and aza-Prins variants, this proposal will aim to 1) apply enantioselective Prins-type cyclizations to the synthesis of bioactive molecules, and 2) study the reaction mechanism and model catalyst-substrate interactions to elucidate the origin of enantioinduction. In particular, the synthetic ai of the proposed research will focus on introducing pharmacophoric moieties and maximizing the generality and structural diversity of the enantioselective transformations. The successful achievement of these specific aims would represent a significant practical and conceptual advance, solving an important synthetic problem and contributing to the utility and fundamental understanding of hydrogen bond donor catalysts. Moreover, this enabling synthetic method will allow biologically active aliphatic heterocycle-containing molecules to be prepared and modified efficiently for the development of diverse sp3-rich compound libraries in order to study and improve existing therapies and to discover new therapies for the treatment of human diseases."
"9358819","PROGRAM SUMMARY  Transplantation tolerance, a state of long-lasting immune unresponsiveness to donor antigens after cessation of therapy, is an attractive approach for life-long graft acceptance without global immunosuppression. Long-term follow up of tolerant patients has revealed that tolerance can be lost in some individuals after years of graft stability, sometimes after infections, raising 2 possibilities: that tolerance at induction was equally robust but some patients were exposed to more inflammatory events that eroded the state of tolerance, or that tolerance at induction was metastable in some patients and robust in others.  The first cycle of our Program Project addressed the first possibility using a mouse model of transplantation tolerance that is robust and resistant to most inflammatory challenges with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes (Lm). Importantly, we tracked alloreactive T cells by analyzing small numbers of congenic TCR-Tg alloreactive T cells seeded before transplantation, or using fluorescent pMHC Class I and Class II multimers to identify endogenous populations of T cells reactive to model donor antigens. By comparing alloreactive T cells before (Project 1) and after (Project 2) Lm infection of tolerant mice, our Program discovered that i) robust transplantation tolerance is maintained by multiple redundant mechanisms of T cell tolerance, including constraining alloreactive T cell numbers, increasing the ratio of regulatory to conventional T cells, inhibiting conventional T cells intrinsically and restraining alloreactive T cell populations to clones with low avidity for alloantigen; ii) robust tolerance is resilient because it spontaneously returned in animals that experienced Lm-dependent graft rejection; iii) tolerance after infection is eroded and dependent on single mechanisms of T cell tolerance such that blockade of PD-L1 or depletion of Tregs was sufficient to precipitate graft rejection in tolerant hosts post-infection but not in uninfected hosts. Globally, our Program has demonstrated that transplantation tolerance is not an all-or-none state, but rather can exist at different levels of robustness. These observations highlight the need to precisely define and monitor the mechanisms underlying graft acceptance in each tolerant recipient and to devise strategies to improve tolerance when it becomes eroded. For this Competitive Renewal, we will address the second possibility, that not all patients achieve robust tolerance at induction. Globally, we hypothesize that the mechanisms restraining alloreactive T cell subsets can distinguish robust tolerance established in naive hosts from eroded tolerance after infection, and from metastable or failed tolerance in sensitized hosts. Project 1 will focus on 2 novel features of alloreactive T cells that we recently discovered as characteristic of robust transplantation tolerance in naïve hosts, namely, cell intrinsic hyporesponsiveness and the constraint of alloreactive T cells to low avidity clones Project 2 will study how allosensitization, a major barrier to the induction of transplantation tolerance, affects the induction of the individual mechanisms of T cell tolerance that characterize robust tolerance."
"9335832","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) has shown promise as an alternative to invasive surgery for a growing number of clinical applications, including treatment of uterine fibroids, palliation of pain from bone metastases, and treatment of neurological disorders. Although the procedure is superior to traditional invasive surgery, the duration of this treatment incurs significant cost and discomfort for patients, reducing practical implementation and impact in many cases. In this application, we propose a dual approach using multi-focus insonation in conjunction with phase change nanodroplets to dramatically improve treatment times. Multi-focus insonation is the process of using an array transducer to create a focal pattern with multiple high intensity locations that can heat tissue more efficiently than is possible with a single focus. We seek to combine this insonation method with nanodroplets that selectively amplify the thermal effects of ultrasound when activated. These particles are in a liquid state when injected but undergo phase change to microbubbles when subjected to a high-pressure acoustic pulse. Therefore, only nanodroplets in the tissue surrounding the multiple foci will undergo phase change, resulting in substantial thermal and mechanical energy amplification at this large multi-focus volume. At the same time, nanodroplets outside of the focal zone will not experience their acoustic activation threshold and will remain in the acoustically dormant liquid state, thereby avoiding thermal amplification in tissues outside of the acoustic focus, sparing healthy tissue. We hypothesize that the combination of multi-focus ultrasound and phase change nanodroplets will enable the use of MRgFUS to treat a clinically relevant volume three times faster than currently available methods while maintaining precise control over the margins of the treated region. Such an improvement would significantly reduce the time required for current clinical applications of MRgFUS and expand its role into applications where treatment of large volumes is desired but not feasible."
"9487536","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human brain contains billions of axons that follow precise pathways essential for the establishment of functional connections. Despite intensive efforts, only few disorders resulting from errors in axon guidance have been identified wherein, their molecular etiologies have not been elucidated. I have identified mutations in PCDH12 in families presenting abnormalities in brain connectivity. I now plan to broaden the screening to identify additional novel gene mutations related to brain wiring defects. Identifying genetic causes will not only shed light on the pathological mechanisms but also will provide insight about the cellular and molecular machinery during development. A major challenge for understanding neurodevelopmental disorders to date, has been the lack of affected tissue. The capacity to differentiate neural tissue from patient induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) opens an exciting avenue to reveal unique human features of disease. Thus, during the mentored phase of this award, I propose to utilize a combination of iPSC and animal models to uncover the molecular basis underlying axon guidance and neural circuit formation in the absence of PCDH12. During the independent phase I will conduct mechanistic studies to characterize the functional interaction between PCDH12 and Cofilin pertaining to axon guidance in both iPSC and mouse disease models, utilizing the skills obtained during the mentored phase of the award. To pursue the proposed research, I have generated iPSCs from patient and control fibroblasts and I have started the characterization of Pcdh12-/- mice. My long-term goal is to combine my background in neuronal death and synapse formation with the expertise in axon guidance; which will be acquired during the proposed training, in order to better understand brain wiring defects. I aim to integrate human genetics, animal, and stem cell disease models to elucidate the molecular mechanisms pertaining to neural circuit formation. I believe that this combination of techniques will provide insights into how the human brain develops and revolutionize our understanding of neurodevelopmental disorders, laying the groundwork for developing new therapies."
"9146709","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Approximately 1/3 of people living with epilepsy (PWE) continue to have seizures despite anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). Recent trials using therapeutic brain stimulation show reductions in seizures, but rarely provide seizure free outcomes. Although seizures occupy a small fraction of their life, as little as 0.01%, PWE take anti-epileptic drugs (AED) daily, suffer AED related side effects, and spend their lives dreading when the next seizure will strike. The apparent randomness of seizures is associated with significant psychological consequences. We hypothesize that epilepsy can be more effectively managed, both the seizures and their psychological impact, by providing patients with accurate seizure diaries, real-time seizure forecasting, and responsive stimulation for brain state modulation. With accurate seizure forecasting patients would be empowered to manage their life activities. The optimal epilepsy management device requires: 1) Automated seizure detection 2) Accurate Automated Electronic Seizure Diaries 3) Seizure Forecasting and 4) Programmable Brain Stimulation. In this grant we develop an epilepsy management and therapy platform using Medtronic's 3rd generation device implantable device. The RC+S provides chronic nervous system sensing and analytics using embedded scientific instrumentation (e.g. - sensors, classification, and control policy implementation), and provides a unique opportunity for exploring and managing epileptic neural networks."
"9398393","ABSTRACT The field of skeletal muscle myogenesis has undergone a tremendous growth in the last several years, including some exciting new therapies in neuromuscular diseases. Very recently, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the first drug to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy. This is highly significant, as before this approval, skeletal muscle had been considered the last remaining druggable organ in the human body without a targeted therapy. With this breakthrough, other opportunities await for the treatment of muscular dystrophy and other skeletal muscle wasting conditions. Similar to Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the next breakthroughs will likely derive from fundamental discoveries in basic science. In skeletal myogenesis, this will come from expanding our knowledge base for how muscle cells develop during embryogenesis and postnatal growth, how muscle stem cells contribute to skeletal muscle repair, how muscle interacts with other cell types such as blood vessels and motor neurons in the muscle microenvironment, and how muscle stem cells and myofibers regulate their metabolism and cell survival. Basic research will lead to the identification of critical genes and signaling pathways in each of these areas, and ultimately to the design of new therapies. The international meeting on Myogenesis, a Gordon Research Conference (GRC) has historically been viewed as one of the preeminent skeletal muscle meetings, attracting speakers and attendants from around the world. The purpose of this R13 proposal is to seek partial support for the upcoming GRC conference on Myogenesis: Advanced Mechanisms of Growth and Repair, to be held at the Renaissance Tuscany Il Ciocco Resort Lucca, Italy, on June 11-16, 2017. The overall goal for this conference is to bring together diverse expertise, including leaders in our field, to educate and stimulate participation and discussion among all conference attendees. This goal will be accomplished by performing two specific aims. Aim 1 will convene invited speakers to the GRC to exchange new information on the underlying mechanisms of skeletal muscle homeostasis and turnover in development, disease, and aging. These topics will be communicated through nine scientific sessions focusing on embryonic and postnatal development, regeneration, cell fusion, muscle/stroma interactions, energy regulation, remodelling, transcription and epigenomics, and basic mechanisms in neuromuscular disorders. In addition, four evening poster sessions will stimulate interactions between all attendees will specifically providing a forum for junior scientists to present their work and receive feedback from other participants. Aim 2 will enrich the education of junior scientists through the Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), a two-day graduate and postdoc only conference that takes place immediately preceding the GRC. The GRS will conduct four sessions of talks and two poster sessions by graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. These activities represent a unique opportunity for the next generation of scientists to present their research on myogenesis, interact with their peers, and form new collaborations. Achieving these aims will place the field in a better position to accelerate the development of new therapies."
"9294087","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Spinal cord injury (SCI) disrupts connections between the brain and spinal cord, causing devastating loss of mobility and independence. Most injuries are incomplete (iSCI), leaving intact at least some neural pathways to motor neurons that control movement. Although spontaneous plasticity in these spared pathways underlies some functional recovery, the extent of spontaneous recovery after iSCI is slow, variable and frustratingly limited. There is a critical need for new therapies that induce further improvements in persons with chronic iSCI. We recently demonstrated that repetitive exposure to acute intermittent hypoxia (rAIH), alone or in combination with walking training, stimulates motor recovery in persons with chronic iSCI. As an early stage investigator, I now propose to test four hypotheses concerning mechanisms of rAIH-induced motor recovery using multiple experimental approaches, including muscle electromyography, measurements of walking dynamics and leg strength, genotyping and pharmacological intervention. In Aim 1, we will focus on the neuromechanical bases of improved walking after rAIH, including increased motor gain (muscle activity) and coordination, as well as, reduced step-by-step variability. In Aim 2, we will test whether the functional benefits of rAIH when combined with training (strength or walking) are task-specific. We hypothesize that the cellular mechanisms that underlie the benefits of rAIH (alone or combined with training) in respiratory and non- respiratory motor function in rodent models applies also to humans with chronic, iSCI. Since AIH induces spinal motor plasticity in rats by a mechanism that requires serotonin-dependent synthesis of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), in Aim 3, we will explore the BDNF-dependence of rAIH-induced motor recovery by assessing the impact of extent of functional recovery in individuals with bdnf polymorphisms known to undermine spinal BDNF function in humans. Finally, concurrent activation of competing cellular cascades during AIH (initiated by serotonin and adenosine, respectively) undermines respiratory motor plasticity in rats. By removing the adenosine-dependent mechanism, greater functional plasticity can be achieved. Thus, in Aim 4, we hypothesize that, by pharmaceutically removing the adenosine constraint on rAIH-induced spinal plasticity via caffeine administration, the therapeutic efficacy of rAIH will improve, increasing its potential asa viable treatment to improve motor function. Each aim is supported by substantial preliminary data, suggesting that the proposed experiments will advance our understanding of mechanisms giving rise to rAIH-induced motor recovery after iSCI. An important goal guiding our research is to identify ways to optimize rAIH-induced plasticity, thereby promoting meaningful functional recovery in persons with chronic iSCI."
"9363013","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Common to all eating disorders (ED) are alterations in the motivation to eat , ranging from extreme food restriction and weight loss, to binge eating coupled with compensatory strategies like self-induced vomiting. Despite the traditional emphasis on these physical symptoms, they often overlap, and, along with significant diagnostic crossover (e.g., from anorexia nervosa to bulimia nervosa) over the course of one's illness, suggest shared features that are not well captured by current diagnostic criteria. This novel proposal aims to examine how RDoC-based temperament measures ? behavioral activation/impulsivity, behavioral inhibition, and effortful control ? identify clinically meaningful groups of adolescent ED patients that may reflect core dimensions of ED better than DSM diagnosis and correspond more strongly to brain function and clinical symptoms. These temperaments are thought to play a role in ED behavior because they are linked to altered incentive processing, particularly in the ventral striatum and insula, which guides approach and avoidance motivation via evaluation of anticipated and actual outcomes. For example, in other approach disorders, like addiction, high impulsivity is associated with reduced striatal activity during monetary reward anticipation,8 whereas in avoidance disorders, anxiety and inhibition are linked with an increased insula response to reward anticipation,9 and decreased striatal outcome response.10 We test the novel hypothesis that over- and under- controlled eating behavior reflects aberrant incentive processing stemming from altered evaluation of anticipated and/or actual outcome to induce compensatory consumption (approach) or avoidance behaviors. We will recruit 150 females currently ill with an ED and 50 controls ages 14-17 to investigate how temperaments reflecting greater inhibition, impulsivity, or effortful control correspond to 1) clinical symptoms and 2) the brain's response to anticipation and outcome of appetitive and aversive generalized (monetary wins and losses) and disorder-specific (taste) salient stimuli, and 3) by collecting follow-up clinical data one year later, identify how temperament-based subtypes predict ED symptom change (e.g., clinical prediction). Demonstrating that certain temperament and personality characteristics are directly related to brain response to both money and taste, rather than only disorder-specific food stimuli, and that correspond to clinical symptoms, will provide greater support for the contribution of biological processes underlying incentive processing to ED behavior. We will also explore whether temperament is meaningfully related to white matter structural connectivity and resting state functional connectivity to further characterize brain-behavior relationships in adolescent ED. Resolving these questions is critical to our mechanistic understanding of the neural basis of disordered eating and will move us towards more meaningful characterization and development of more targeted intervention and prevention strategies than subtyping by physical symptoms."

"9238765","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute inhibition of renal gene expression to prevent nephrotoxicity Prevention of AKI is of paramount importance, but success has been limited when approaches are applied generally. A key reason for these failures is a lack of targets specific to a given cause of AKI. This project utilizes a population genetics model to identify genes associated with sensitivity to four clinically relevant nephrotoxins: gentamicin, colistin, cisplatin, and clofarabine. In this proposal, we seek to validate the success of this population genetics model with acute in vivo siRNA inhibition of renal gene expression. The efficacy of target gene inhibition will be tested in corresponding murine models of drug-induced AKI to determine if this therapeutic strategy mitigates nephrotoxicity. A secondary aim of this project is to discern if acute inhibition of candidate transport genes similarly prevents nephrotoxicity by inhibiting proximal tubular uptake of gentamicin, colistin, cisplatin, or clofarabine. The expected outcome is to determine an optimal nephrotoxicity prevention strategy for each drug. The approach will be paradigm shifting - bringing a drug-specific intervention to each form of renal injury. The precedent for premedication to prevent nephrotoxicity is used in clinical practice as saline is often given to prevent contrast nephropathy. Thus, the siRNA strategies outlined in this proposal hold clinical relevance and the potential to translate to clinical trials. This approach wll yield multiple new molecular therapeutics specific to a variety of nephrotoxins, ready for rapid translation to clinical trials. My long-term goal is to become a physician scientist using large databases to uncover and validate genetic biomarkers and therapeutic targets which will readily translate to clinical care. Through this K08 award, I will learn new techniques including: analytic methods for genetic databases, animal model experimentation, laser micro-dissection (LMD), and in vivo siRNA knockdown. The acquired techniques will allow me to complete the above aims, but also provide the foundation to successfully compete for future R01 funding to: 1) uncover biomarkers from large genetic databases, 2) determine nephron segment specific gene expression with LMD of biopsy tissue, and 3) test mechanistic pathways and therapeutic targets in vivo with siRNA inhibition. These techniques can be applied to the improvement of renal care for many conditions. Further, the mentoring team I have assembled will advise me on the translation of these siRNA constructs to future clinical trials. My mentors and advisors at the Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM) have a previous history of translating their pre-clinical studies with siRNA to successful phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. The rich environment at IUSM is sure to aid in my development as a physician scientist. With a dual appointment in the divisions of nephrology and clinical pharmacology, I am exposed to a wide range of collaborators in nearly every primary division. My division heads, Sharon Moe and David Flockhart, effectively protect my time as my clinical obligations are limited to 4 weeks of inpatient service and 1/2 day of clinic. They have provided ample laboratory space, start-up funds, and a technician. Our school renewed its NIH Clinical Translational Science Award (the Indiana CTSI) in 2013. I have already reaped the benefits of this advantage by obtaining a CTSI biomedical researcher grant. Finally, my mentors, Pierre Dagher and Todd Skaar, are incredibly supportive. The two of them provide a balance so I learn skills in both mouse models of acute kidney injury and pharmacogenomics analysis / validation. In summary, the proposed project builds logically on my fellowship training in nephrology and clinical pharmacology. My transition to Indiana University School of Medicine makes a great deal of sense not only because of its institutional commitment to me, but also what I can learn from my selected mentors, Drs. Pierre Dagher, Todd Skaar, and David Flockhart in order to address my specific aims and hypothesis. With ties to clinical pharmacology and nephrology, I am poised to apply novel strategies to nephrotoxicity prevention and other kidney diseases."
"9340065","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The claudin family is composed of transmembrane proteins that are an essential part of the tight junctions forming barriers in epithelial and endothelial tissue. In the cochlea, Claudin 9 (Cldn9) is highly expressed in the tight junctions of the organ of Corti, where separation of high potassium (K+) endolymph from the low K+ perilymph fluid is necessary for protection of the outer hair cells (OHCs), as well as for maintaining the Endocochlear Potential (EP) (Nakano et al 2009, Wangemann and Schacht, 1996). Our lab has focused on identifying genes that are resistant to noise stress (Street, et al. 2014). Among the five quantitative trait loci (QTL) that appeared in the 129S6/SvEvTac (129S6) strain, the strongest QTL contains Cldn9. Surprisingly, when we started to study the noise sensitivity it became apparent that this locus also displayed an age-related hearing loss (AHL) phenotype that was non-progressive hearing loss (NPHL), and a significant mid-frequency ARHL by 12 months. To explore functional attributes of Cldn9, we have recently developed a Doxycyline (dox) regulated version of the Cldn9 gene that can be up or down regulated. We are assured that the changes that we observe after dox manipulation are due to the Cldn9 expression. Here we will examine the role of Cldn9 in an aging auditory system, including the influence noise and the question of Cldn9?s role in potassium leakage."
"9358181","Responsible for up to 50% of cellular phosphoserine/threonine phosphatase activity, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) regulates almost all cell signaling pathways. PP2A comes as > 80 kinds of heterotrimers, consisting of a catalytic C subunit and one of many regulatory B subunits bound to an A? (90% abundant) or (10% abundant) A? subunit scaffold. Our premise is that protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) using the A? scaffold is fundamentally important for controlling phenotypes of both normal and cancer cells. Moreover, study of polyomaviruses, which have repeatedly given novel insights into growth control, will be invaluable to understand A? function. Our studies of murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) ST/MT already demonstrate the importance of A? to survival, differentiation and transformation. Our sh/siRNA A? knockdowns of confirm its importance, even in the absence of virus, to pathways important in cancer. Both Akt and c-Src signaling are regulated by A?. In addition, human lung, breast and colon cancers show alterations in A?, suggesting that A?-PP2A-mediated signaling is relevant to cancer. Very little work has been done on A?, so there is a pressing need to study its function. In Aim 1 we will use broad-based technologies in a survey of functions and integrate these approaches to identify pathways altered by A? in normal and transformed cells. Expression analysis by RNA-seq, phosphoproteomic analysis, and NMR metabolomics will identify pathways specifically targeted by PP2A A?. Comparisons of controls with cells expressing MuPyV MT or ST will inform us whether the oncoproteins are inhibiting A? activity and/or redirecting it to new targets. Aim 2, focusing on A?, will determine the A?/ST structure. PP2A B subunits and other targets that bind A? will be determined. Genetic analysis of A? will uncover sequences responsible for its unique phenotype(s). In Aim 3 A? regulation of tyrosine kinase signaling will be examined to learn the mechanism of c-Src control and to determine how A? broadly controls tyrosine phosphorylation, perhaps via tyrosine phosphatases. ST mutants defective for A? binding will be identified to test the role of A? in controlling cell phenotype. Finally, we will confirm the role of A? in Her2/neu and MT tumorigenesis using conditional knockout technology. !"
"9390666","Project Summary: The goal of this proposal is to advance our ability to accurately infer the properties of neu- ral-level responses from the more coarse-grained information obtained with non-invasive imaging in humans. To achieve this goal, the project will capitalize on feature-selective cortical responses. For example, many neu- rons in visual cortex exhibit a tuning function such as a response profile in which firing rate is greatest for one orientation of a line, and falls off for orientations progressively less similar to that orientation. Promising new methods for analyzing functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data reveal analogous feature-tuning in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal. Because these voxel-level tuning functions (VTFs) are superficially analogous to the neural tuning functions (NTFs) observed with electrophysiology, it is tempting to interpret VTFs as mirroring the characteristics of the underlying NTFs that contribute to them. However, this interpretation is not justified because there are multiple alternative accounts by which changes in the NTFs could produce a given change in the VTF. To distinguish between these accounts, we need a means of map- ping VTFs back to NTFs. That is, for fMRI to provide insights into neural-level mechanisms, the inverse prob- lem of mapping voxel-level fMRI signals back to neural-level responses must be solved. The proposed work will tackle this inverse problem by considering a plausible set of neural-level changes that may give rise to an observed change in voxel-level fMRI responses, and determining which model of neural-level change is most likely using either model recovery or hierarchical Bayesian estimation, followed by model selection. The goal will be accomplished via three specific aims: (1) Determine the conditions that allow us to distinguish between alternative models of neural-level modulation for a simple modulation of orientation-selective VTFs (stimulus contrast); (2) Identify the neural-level mechanisms underlying modulations of orientation-selective VTFs induced by other manipulations of perceptual or cognitive state; and (3) Identify the neural-level mecha- nisms underlying modulation of two further classes of VTF. The approach for all three aims entails: i) collecting optimal fMRI data, ii) applying alternative models of neural-level modulation to the fMRI data to account for voxel-level modulations, iii) performing model selection based upon model recovery or hierarchical Bayesian estimation, iv) comparing the outcome of model selection with ?ground truth? from electrophysiology. The pro- ject will thereby develop an experimental and model selection procedure for revealing the neural-level mecha- nisms that underlie modulations in feature-selective voxel responses observed with fMRI. Moreover, it will ena- ble the comparison of data from animal studies investigating fine-grained neural mechanisms with data from non-invasive imaging in humans, for a range of perceptual and cognitive phenomena."

In order to maintain a healthy colony of research and breeding nonhuman primates, VS provides a number of services including preventive medicine, clinical care of spontaneous disease as well as research-related conditions, diagnostic imaging, and clinical surgery. VS also contributes to the mission of the WaNPRC by providing comprehensive veterinary support to research projects including anesthetic support for all surgical procedures performed at the center. Veterinarians and veterinary technicians provide a wide array of surgical and technical support upon request. VS plays a critical role in ensuring regulatory compliance through IACUC protocol review and post-approval monitoring. Biosecurity is also within the purview of VS. Three organisms of concern have been identified in non-human primates at the WaNPRC: Simian retrovirus (SRV), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and Coccidioides immitis, the causative organism of Valley Fever. Strategies are being implemented with the goal of elimination of these organisms from the WaNPRC colony. The VS Unit is closely integrated with the other units in the Division of Primate Resources (DPR). Communication and cross-training among the units increases quality and efficiency. Coordination among the units will be increased by implementation of the automated workflow component of the Animal Research Management System (ARMS). VS plays a major role in training both DPR members and investigator staff. The goal of VS is to support world-renowned research performed at the WaNPRC with 24/7 veterinary expertise and clinical coverage, partner with scientists to develop well designed projects and incorporate refinements and work closely with other DPR units to ensure the humane care and well-being of the colony."
"8106991","Previous studies have indicated the kidney plays a dominant role in the long-tern control of arterial pressure  and that the pressure-natriuresis relationship is shifted to higher pressures in every genetic and experimental  model of hypertension that has been studied to date. However, the factors that alter renal function and the  genes and pathways involved remain to be determined. Previous work done in this program revealed that  pressure-natriuresis is associated with elevations in renal medullary blood flow and interstitial hydrostatic  pressure (RIHP) and inhibition of Na+ transport in the proximal tubule. During the last funding period, we found  that elevations in RIHP stimulate the renal formation of 20-HETE and that 20-HETE contributes to the  pressure-natriuretic response by inhibiting sodium transport in the proximal tubule. We further demonstrated  that blockade of the formation of 20-HETE promotes the development of salt-sensitive hypertension and  obtained exciting new evidence that transfer of a 5 cM region of chromosome 5 containing the CYP4504A  alleles from Lewis rats onto the Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) genetic background increases the renal expression of  CYP4A protein and attenuates the development of hypertension. We now have preliminary data that transfer of  chromosome 5 from the Brown Norwary (BN) rat onto the SS genetic background also opposes the  development of hypertension in a SS.5BN consomic strain. These findings support our working hypothesis  that a deficiency in the renal formation of 20-HETE contributes to the development of hypertension in  SS rats. The goal of this project is to determine whether there is a sequence variant that reduces the activity or  expression of one of the CYP4A genes in the kidney of SS rats and plays a causal role in the development of  hypertension or if this pathway maybe secondarily involved because the expression of CYP4A isoforms are  regulated by some other gene on chromosome 5. The Specific Aims are: 1) to determine whether the  antihypertensive and renoprotective effects of transfer of chromosome 5 from the BN rat into the SS genetic  background is dependent on an increase in the renal expression of CYP4A protein and the production of 20-  HETE; 2) to determine if there is a sequence variant in one of the four CYP4A genes that reduces the  expression or activity of these enzymes in the kidney of SS rats; and 3) to test if any of the sequence variants  identified in the CYP4A genes contribute to the development of hypertension and renal disease in SS rats  using transgenic techniques. The novel aspects of these studies are that they will employ unique  chromosome 5 congenic and consomic strains of SS rats that we developed over the last 5 years, a new  LC/MS/MS assay for measurement of 20-HETE, novel inhibitors of the synthesis and actions of 20-HETE, real  time-PCR assays for measuring the expression of CYP4A isoforms and a new lentiviral strategy for creating  transgenic strains of rats The proposed studies to determine if a genetic abnormality in the renal formation of  20-HETE contributes to the development of hypertension in SS rats by resetting the pressure-natriuretic  relationship are especially unique and relevant, since a polymorphism in the CYP4A11 gene that reduces the  formation of 20-HETE has recently been associated with elevated blood pressure in three independent human  populations.77'183'184 These studies will provide a new homologous animal model system to explore  mechanisms to explain how a deficiency in the renal formation of 20-HETE could contribute to the  development of salt-sensitive forms of hypertension in man. The results obtained may also spur the  development of drugs that upregulate this pathway for the treatment of hypertension and renal disease."
"9257890","Project Summary / Abstract The goal of the Research Translation Core (RTC) in the Boston University Superfund Research Program (BUSRP) is to make research from the Center's projects and activities accessible to other SRPs, governmental organizations, the broader scientific community, and the lay public. Within the BUSRP, the RTC integrates and coordinates research translation throughout every level, from staff, to trainees, and to Project and Core Leaders, in order to first connect personnel to a broad and increasing range of stakeholders, and then to assist them in translating their work into useful, actionable information. RTC- and investigator-initiated research translation is accomplished by: (i) leveraging the resources and the reach of robust research translation partners including the Zephyr Education Foundation, the NOAA Woods Hole Aquarium, the Museum of Science, Boston, the Collaborative on Health and the Environment, the New England Society for Risk Analysis, Hands Across the River (New Bedford), the Massachusetts Association of Health Boards, and the Mystic River Watershed Association, and (ii) long-cultivated relationships with city, state, and national level government organizations including, but not limited to the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection, the Massachusetts congressional delegation, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, many individual Massachusetts town Boards of Health, the Toxics Use Reduction Institute, and regional and national offices of the USEPA. This proposal expands on our previous work, and extends it to new users to accomplish four specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Promote research translation-oriented communication within the NIEHS SRP. This aim is met by improving the communication skills of Project Leaders, trainees, and staff, and by the use of strategies to improve information sharing within and outside of the Superfund Research Program. Specific Aim 2: Deepen collaborations with governmental organizations responsible for protecting public health, with a focus on impacts of early life exposures to Superfund chemicals. This aim is met by actively engaging relevant governmental agencies in activities that inform agency staff of emerging developments in environmental health, toxicology, and risk assessment that are important to their decision-making process. Specific Aim 3: Facilitate technology transfer by providing tools and resources to end-users. This aim is met by making outcome data, computational models, reagents, and other resources accessible to the scientific community. Specific Aim 4: Design and implement research translation to broad audiences. This aim will be met through multiple tools including podcasts, newsletters, blogs, and other web-based platforms, opinion pieces, national conference calls, forums, workshops, seminars and community/agency meetings. These initiatives will be accomplished in collaboration with the Community Engagement and Training Cores, and will be orchestrated by RTC leadership with documented expertise in laboratory and regulatory toxicology, risk assessment, and science communication and with long-nurtured community and regulatory organization relationships."
"9363470","Summary. The dramatic increase in obesity and associated comorbidities in the United States is a major public health concern. While weight loss improves these conditions, widespread difficulty in implementing successful diets and high recidivism are major barriers to effective obesity treatments. The objective of this proposal is to identify neuron subpopulations and define neural mechanisms that impede weight loss. Agouti-related protein (AgRP)-expressing neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus are activated by energy deficit and motivate food seeking and consumption. We have demonstrated that AgRP neurons transmit a negative valence signal that may underlie the negative affect often associated with hunger and weight loss. Thus, there is a critical need to identify how AgRP neurons communicate with other brain regions to drive negative valence, food seeking, and consumption. AgRP neurons can be divided into distinct subpopulations that project to one of several target brain regions, but our understanding of the distinct AgRP projection subpopulations that mediate the physiological and affective consequences of AgRP neural activity remains incomplete. To this end, the complementary aims in this proposal use state-of-the-art techniques to characterize, with unprecedented levels of detail, the AgRP neuron projection subpopulations and circuit mechanisms that drive food intake. Specifically, our experiments will (1) identify the distinct AgRP projection subpopulation(s) that mediate the negative valence associated with hunger, (2) determine the endogenous activity patterns of AgRP subpopulations during the transition between replete and deprived physiological states, (3) examine how AgRP subpopulation activity changes with obesity, and (4) determine the AgRP projection subpopulations that contribute to the motivation to work for food. Overall, results from these experiments will identify brain regions that are physiologically and functionally recruited by AgRP neuron activity, providing novel neural substrate targets that can be leveraged to develop potent therapies for obesity."
"9397902","ABSTRACT Heme biosynthesis is one of the oldest, most evolutionarily conserved, highly regulated, and essential metabolic pathways in humans. However, our understanding of the pathway's tissue-specific regulation, enzyme structures and catalytic mechanisms, intra/inter-cellular metabolite transport, as well as the pathogenesis of its inherited and acquired disorders, the porphyrias, remain subjects of active investigation. Current efforts are elucidating the role of modifying genes in the tissue-specific expression of the heme enzymes (e.g., ClpX, ClpP), transport of the pathway's metabolites (e.g., ABCB6, PEPT2, FLVCR1), and interaction of ferrochelatase with other mitochondrial proteins to form heme. Moreover, patients with normal heme biosynthetic gene sequences, but who have the metabolic hallmarks of the acute hepatic (markedly elevated porphyrin precursors) or erythropoietic (marked elevated protoporphyrin IX) porphyrias indicate the existence of unknown regulatory elements in the heme biosynthetic genes, or undiscovered porphyria causing genes. Therefore, it's timely to bring together international experts to present and discuss the latest basic, translational, and clinical studies of the pathway and its disorders, including emerging therapies. A two-day Research Conference is planned for January 13-14, 2018 in Atlanta, Georgia. In addition to the latest research presented by international experts, the meeting focus will include panel discussions to address current unresolved knowledge gaps and to stimulate future collaborative research. These panel discussions will be held after each of the sessions and be moderated by the session chairs. To foster trainee career development, each session will have two 10 minute presentations plus 5 minutes of discussion of selected trainee abstracts. In addition, we will offer two trainee/junior faculty breakfast ?talk tables? with experienced mentors to discuss career development and research projects, and two lunch ?talk tables? with our invited speakers to discuss their research presentations and stimulate trainee interest/research. This R13 application requests support for registration costs for trainees and junior faculty, travel awards for selected abstracts submitted by trainees/junior faculty, and other costs such as printing syllabi and CME fees. Additional industry support will be sought for foreign speaker travel, meeting announcements, hotel costs (audio-visual equipment, conference room fees, etc.) and publication costs. We anticipate the Conference attendees will include pre- and post- doctoral fellows, medical and MD/PhD students, junior faculty, and established basic and applied research scientists, as well as physician scientists working in heme biosynthesis and its disorders. The Conference will be advertised in appropriate Journals and Society communications to inform American and foreign basic and clinical investigators and interested healthcare providers. In conjunction with the proposed Research Conference, we will also organize a separate one-day program to provide clinicians and researchers with the latest clinical, diagnostic, and treatment advances for the hepatic and erythropoietic porphyrias. 1"
"9327409","PROJECT SUMMARY Branched tissue networks are conserved throughout the animal kingdom, often found in organs that require a large surface area relative to a confining tissue volume. The lung uses one such branched epithelial network to achieve rapid gas exchange. Deviation from the normal branching morphogenesis of the lung airways results in respiratory defects, such as pulmonary hypoplasia. Normal airway epithelial morphogenesis requires three critical factors, including branch site specification, branch elongation, and mesenchymal remodeling to shape the elongating branch. Therefore, understanding mechanisms that influence branching patterns will provide a molecular and physical basis for bronchopulmonary abnormalities. The role of the pulmonary mesenchyme in directing branch formation by secreting diffusible factors, such as fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), is well established. However, how mesenchymal cells alter the mechanical properties of the microenvironment adjacent to the airway epithelium is less clear. Epithelial branching in the mammary and salivary glands requires the turnover of basement membrane (BM) proteins at branch tips to promote elongation, presumably because intact BM constrains epithelial growth. BM proteins appear to be reduced at the tips of airway epithelial branches, although it is not clear how constraints imposed by the BM may affect airway branch initiation. In the mammalian lung, airway smooth muscle (SM) differentiates at sites of epithelial branch bifurcation and contractions of SM are required for branching morphogenesis. While SM contractions are required for normal airway branching, it is unclear how SM differentiation is specified at branch tips. This proposal aims to illuminate how the extracellular matrix (ECM) and SM contractions constrain epithelial branches to direct branching morphogenesis. This work will provide insight into how mesenchymal remodeling may alter the mechanical microenvironment proximal to epithelial branches in the lung, and thereby direct airway branching morphogenesis."

"9282593","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is thought that nearly half of infertility cases have a genetic basis. Despite extensive knowledge gained from gene knockouts in mice, the genetic causes for the vast majority of idiopathic human infertilities are unknown. Traditional methods for studying inheritance, such as GWAS or linkage analysis, have been confounded by heterogeneity of infertility phenotypes and hundreds of genes involved in reproduction. Finally, we do not know the proportion of cases in which genetically-based infertilities are caused by de novo mutations vs. inheritance of alleles segregating in the human population. This project proposes a new, comprehensive, and multidisciplinary approach to this problem that will screen and identify nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) that functionally disrupt gametogenesis. The complementary expertise of two laboratories - one which has developed massively parallel in silico and in vitro methods to predict and validate disease-causing nsSNPs, and the other a leader in discovery and characterization of infertility genes using mouse mutant models - will together be brought together to bear on the problem. The Specific Aims are to: 1) Use computational approaches and high-throughput in vitro assays to identify nsSNPs in human infertility genes that are likely to disrupt protein function. These alleles will be precisely modeed in mice using CRISPR/Cas genome editing. 2) Phenotype the mouse models to identify those SNPs which impact gametogenesis and fertility. Overall, ~125 mouse models corresponding to nsSNPs in >300 known reproduction genes will be made. Already, 2 of 5 nsSNPs tested caused infertility. Establishing a database of experimentally-validated benign and deleterious SNPs in reproduction genes will revolutionize and empower the human reproductive genetics field as we enter the era of personalized medicine by improving the identification of causative alleles in exome-sequenced patients."

"9288099","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol abuse has been attributed to 3.2% of the world's disease burden. Chronic abuse manifests as reversible steatosis, steatohepatitis and/or irreversible cirrhosis. Regardless abstinence, 5-15% of patients with steatohepatitis still progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Studies have demonstrated the role of miR-122 as a mediator of hepatic metabolism, cellular differentiation and the development of HCC. Our laboratory has shown decreased miR-122 in a four-week chronic-alcohol mouse model. The role of miR-122 in ALD is unknown. Bioinformatic miRNA target prediction tools suggest Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1-? (HIF1?) is a primary target of miR-122. HIF1? is critical to the progression of ALD. Specific Aim 1 will study the role of miR-122 in the pathogenesis of chronic alcohol-induced hepatitis. C57Bl/6 mice will be transfected using a hepatocyte-tropic adeno-associated virus serotype 8 (rAAV) vector to either knockdown or overexpress miR-122 via tough decoy (TuD) or the miR-122 respectively. Mice will be maintained on Lieber-DeCarli diet for 28 days. On day 28 mice will be withdrawn from alcohol and given 150- mg/kg acetaminophen (APAP). Mice will be sacrificed on day 30 to assess regeneration. Livers sections will be analyzed histologically for morphological changes, lipid accumulation, and regeneration. In addition, we will determine the impact on miR-122 modulation on hepatic inflammation and differentiation through expression analysis of inflammatory cytokines and cell cycle regulators associated with ALD. MiR-122 has been correlated with a network of Liver Enriched Transcription Factors (LETFs). Collectively, these LETFs function as master regulators of hepatic function. HNF6?, specifically, has been shown to function in a positive feedback loop with miR-122. Specific Aim 2 will examine the effect of miR-122, its overexpression and knockdown, on HNF6? in a chronic-alcohol model. We will also examine if miR-122 can reduce ALD through enhancement of HNF6? and the LETF network. The rAAV8 vector stated above will deliver anti- HNF6? shRNA or rHNF6 in vivo. The mice will be treated and assayed as described above. During the first year of this fellowship we aim to examine the effect of miR-122 on the severity of ALD development using gene therapy. The remaining two years of my Ph.D. (funding yrs 2 & 3) will be spent studying the effect miR-122 and HNF6? regulation of the LETF network in the progression of ALD. During years 4 and 5 of funding I shall complete my M.D. training while finalizing any work required for publication. Collectively, we propose to examine two potential avenues by which miR-122 may serve as a potential therapeutic modality. First, is the development of steatosis though inhibition of HIF1? and secondly, is the regeneration after alcohol and APAP-induced liver injury."

"9407312","ABSTRACT Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic condition that originates as lipid accumulation within hepatocytes (steatosis) and progresses into nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), characterized by lipid accumulation, inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis. An estimated 100 million adults across the U.S. are thought to have NAFLD, with up to 20 million more estimated to have NASH. Left unchecked, the disease can advance to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Currently, NASH contributes to one third of hepatocellular carcinomas in the US and is the second leading cause of liver transplants in the US. NASH is often referred to as a ?silent? disease as most patients are asymptomatic until problems arise from cirrhosis and liver failure and diagnosis only possible via invasive liver biopsies. Despite well-defined morphological features and decades of intense research worldwide, the mechanisms of NAFLD progression as well as therapeutic approaches and non-invasive diagnostics are still resoundingly absent. Recently, Organovo developed ExVive? Human Liver Tissue, an in vitro 3D bioprinted liver model comprising primary human hepatocytes, hepatic stellates and endothelial cells that better mimics native human liver biology over extended time in culture. The technological advancement of 3D bioprinting enables controlled, reproducible fabrication of 3D liver tissues ex vivo from human cells, yielding a durable liver model with complex composition and architecture that retains metabolic competence and liver-specific functions for at least 4 weeks in culture. The current Fast Track SBIR application seeks to utilize ExVive? Human Liver Tissue to model the onset and progression of human NAFLD via nutrient overload in the first Phase, followed by induction of inflammation, oxidative stress and fibrosis to mimic human NASH in the second Phase. Importantly, in order to drive adoption, the steatosis and NASH models will be validated via comparisons of genomic data with clinically confirmed NAFLD patient data in collaboration with key opinion leader Dr. David Brenner, and verification of altered drug metabolism and disposition via CYP1A2 and 2C9 activities. Lastly, prevention of NAFLD progression and regression of NASH will be assessed via therapeutic modulation of disease phenotypes. Together, these in vitro models have the potential to significantly impact liver disease research by enabling the discovery of novel therapeutics, biomarkers to non-invasively delineate NASH from steatosis, and allow the safety assessment of drugs in a disease relevant background."
"9308669","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease causing joint damage and disability. While, remarkable progress in the treatment of RA over the past two decades has improved many outcomes, mortality rates in RA remain 1.5-3-fold above non-RA controls. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of excess deaths in RA, and most experts believe that enhanced vascular inflammation underpins accelerated atherosclerosis and CV events. Yet, there has been no direct proof for this hypothesis. If true, then RA therapies that reduce joint inflammation might also reduce CV risk. The lack of an RA-specific CV risk tool hampers evidence-based guidelines, as general population tools perform poorly in RA. These gaps in knowledge create uncertainty for patients and providers in managing RA and its comorbidities.  While an RCT with CV events as the outcome would be an ideal study approach to investigate the effect of RA treatments on CVD, there are notable barriers, including very large sample size requirement (~10,000), long trial duration (~3 years) requiring patients to maintain randomization, and the associated costs (~$60M). Moreover, many DMARDs raise LDL presenting ethical challenges in a CVD prevention trial, where enrolling high-risk patients would be desired. Therefore, an alternative outcome utilizing a surrogate CV measure that directly reflects vascular inflammation and has been demonstrated to be responsive to treatment (e.g., with statins) would serve as a scientifically important and feasible proof-of-concept trial. We propose here to use 18fluoro-deoxyglucose by positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) as a novel imaging modality to detect baseline, and DMARD-associated changes in, vascular inflammation in RA.  We will compare the effects on FDG PET/CT of 2 treatment regimens in an RCT among methotrexate (MTX) inadequate responders, representing a critical and common decision point for rheumatologists and patients: addition of a TNFi vs sulfasalazine + hydroxychloroquine to background MTX (Aim 1). Recent RCTs show near equivalent reduction in articular disease activity, but the relative effects of these regimens on CV risk is unknown. Substantial basic science data as well as epidemiologic evidence support the superiority of TNFi on CV inflammation over non-biologic DMARDs, but this has never been studied in an RCT.  Using data from the RCT, we will also compare the effects on vascular inflammation of achieving low disease activity or remission vs remaining in moderate-high disease activity. These pre-specified secondary analyses will pool the treatment arms to examine whether achievement of a disease activity target associates with greater reduction in vascular inflammation. Aim 2a will use DAS-28 scores to categorize treatment response and correlate it with vascular inflammation. Aim 2b will use a multi-biomarker of RA disease activity to categorize treatment response and correlate it with vascular inflammation. Aim 2c will use joint inflammation as measured by FDG PET/CT to categorize treatment response and correlate with vascular inflammation."
"9479720","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project employs a multi-method, transdisciplinary approach that combines ethnographic participant- observation, interview research methods, ethical, legal, and public policy analyses. The two goals of the present project are 1) to identify the ethical, legal, and policy challenges that the field of psychiatric genomics will face when trying to translate the findings of large-scale GWAS into clinically useful information, and 2) to make evidence-based recommendations about how to address these challenges. To achieve these goals, I will use, as a case study, one of the first attempts to translate large-scale psychiatric genomics GWAS findings, the Genomics of Treatment-Resistant Psychosis (GTRP) study. GTRP will perform whole exome sequencing (WES) in a sample of 1,000 institutionalized patients who suffer from treatment-resistant psychosis (TRP). GTRP's goals are to identify genomic variants associated with TRP, and ascertain whether any clinically actionable information emerges from these genomic tests that could help improve mental health care for particular patient-participants.  I propose to study GTRP's experience to address three research aims critical to understanding the challenges faced in translational psychiatric genomics research with severely mentally ill patients. Aim 1 will be the mentored research phase of the project, and Aims 2 and 3 will be the independent research phases.  Aim 1a employs ethnographic participant-observation and interview methods to study the factors that influence GTRP researchers' decision-making process while designing and conducting the WES consent process and the return of results (RoR) components of their study. Aim 1b employs ethical analysis to evaluate the design of the GTRP study, including the WES consent process and RoR components. Aim 1c employs legal and policy analyses to examine the regulatory framework currently in place to protect institutionalized severely mentally ill patients who participate in translational psychiatric WES research.  Aim 2a is an empirical examination informed by Aim 1 that employs interview methods to study the views and preferences of GTRP patient-participants, patient-participants' legal guardians or authorized representatives (LG/AR), patient-participants' mental health clinicians, and officials of the mental health institutions in which GTRP will take place. The interviews will assess their perspectives regarding how to handle the WES consent process, selection of results to return, RoR consent process, actual RoR procedure, and the Post-RoR management of WES findings. Aim 2b employs legal analysis to examine what kind of legal responsibility, if any, LG/ARs, clinicians, and mental health institutions, assume regarding the management of WES findings once these are returned by researchers (Post-RoR management).  Aim 3 employs ethical and legal analyses to explore the implications of applying a legal Fiduciary Relationship Model (FRM) for defining the ethical responsibilities that different parties hold towards patient- participants in translational psychiaric genomics research. This work will be informed by the data collected in Aims 1 and 2."
"9464603","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a strong risk factor and remains the only modifiable target for intervention. However, the mechanisms causing elevated IOP remain poorly understood. Using Oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe, a rare X-linked disease that presents with congenital glaucoma, we have found evidence that OCRL is an important regulator of trafficking in the eye that controls IOP. OCRL is an inositol phosphatase mutated in Lowe syndrome. OCRL localizes within the primary cilium, a subcellular organelle that plays a mechanosensory role in fluid flow. We have identified patients with Lowe syndrome who are born with congenital glaucoma and have characterized their mutations. We discovered that OCRL interacts with TRPV4, a mechanosensory channel in the primary cilia and that modulation of TRPV4 affects IOP in mice. Thus we hypothesize that OCRL plays a critical role in the recruitment of TRPV4 to the cilia in the trabecular meshwork to regulate aqueous outflow. Our aims are to (1) determine the mechanism of OCRL transport in the primary cilium in the trabecular meshwork, (2) determine the functional role of OCRL and TRPV4 interaction in the primary cilium, (3) determine whether targeting TRPV4 can reduce IOP in murine models. The experiments of this proposal may facilitate the discovery of new glaucoma therapies that can reduce the burden of blindness."
"9319336","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Numerous authorities have highlighted the endangered pipeline of physician-scientists and in particular the challenges faced by an even rarer breed - the neurosurgeon-scientist. These challenges are myriad and increasing, and include expanding bureaucracy, greater clinical demands, diminishing research time, rapid pace of advancement in basic science, and limited funding for research training. The mission of the WUSM Department of Neurosurgery, its Residency Training Program, and the Neurosurgery Research Education Program proposed in this grant is to train and develop the future generation of neurosurgeon-scientists so that they can not only contribute to but also lead new discoveries in basic, translational, and clinical neuroscience. The structure of this R25 program incorporates several strategic enhancements to an already robust neurosurgery resident research program such that resident participants will be extremely well prepared to obtain the best junior faculty positions in the country and subsequently secure extramural funding including K series career development awards. An excellent institutional environment for neuroscience research and education in the Department of Neurosurgery and allied Clinical and Basic Science Departments supports this training program. The neurosurgery department at Washington University has a long and distinguished track record of training academic neurosurgeons spanning many decades. This success has been particularly strong over the past 10 years, with over 60% of graduates entering academic practice and nearly 20% of graduates becoming successful NIH-funded neurosurgeon-scientists. The proposed Neurosurgery Research Education Program leverages our past educational experiences and the strong neuroscience community at Washington University in order to develop an enhanced and distinct research training track specifically for neurosurgeons who are inclined to pursue academic careers as independent researchers, with the overall long-term goal of ensuring that highly-trained neurosurgeon-scientists will be available to make future advances that will lead to a reduction in the burden of neurological diseases."

Overall, the Pilot-C Vouchers Program will enhance interactions between the investigator base and the Center."
"9358823","PROJECT SUMMARY  Inducing a robust state of tolerance that is stably maintained despite adverse perturbations is essential for the ability of tolerance mechanisms to maintain the acceptance of the transplanted organ for the life of a recipient. Successfully induced tolerant states in the clinic can be persistent, however in a subset of patients, long-term surviving allografts can be lost. This loss has been correlated with pre-transplant donor-specific antibodies, and in some cases, occurred after episodes of infection. These observations underscore the need to identify individuals who have achieved robust tolerance from those who achieved a less robust/metastable tolerance, where infections may trigger alloreactivity and allograft rejection, and where interventions or closer monitoring may be necessary. While many factors are likely to contribute to a fully robust state of tolerance, in the current funding period, we focused our investigations on the mechanisms that enforce donor-reactive T cell tolerance induced to fully mismatched heart allografts with anti-CD154 in combination with donor spleen cells in mice. We determined that multiple redundant induced T cell tolerance mechanisms maintained transplant tolerance in this model, namely constrained donor-reactive T cell numbers and T cell receptor avidities to levels approximating those in naïve mice; induced cell-intrinsic hypo-responsiveness and expression of negative co-inhibitory molecules by the persisting donor-specific T conventional cells; and increased percentages of FoxP3+ cells within the donor-specific CD4+ T cells. We also demonstrated that pro- inflammatory cytokines produced during infection overrode some of the T cell tolerance mechanisms, resulting in allograft rejection, but that tolerance returned spontaneously when the infection was cleared. Finally, we showed that the restored tolerance after infection was eroded in quality and more susceptible to reversal. That established tolerance mechanisms remain responsive to environmental cues highlights the need for tolerance to be robust at initiation as well as resilient, in order for it to successfully maintain graft acceptance for the life of the recipient.  Recipient sensitization and the ensuing immunological memory is currently considered the most important barrier to achieving tolerance in the clinic. Clinical studies have identified previous transplant rejection and pregnancy as important sensitizing events. This proposal builds on our current findings and focuses on how prior sensitization after graft rejection (Aim 1) or pregnancy (Aim 2) prevents the establishment of specific T cell tolerance mechanisms. The insights gained from these studies will provide granularity into how T cell tolerance mechanisms cooperate to mediate robust transplant tolerance, guide the identification of biomarkers for robust tolerance, and ultimately, lead to rationally designed therapies that are tailored to achieving robust tolerance in sensitized recipients or for restoring robust tolerance after erosion by infection."
"9312129","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glaring knowledge gaps in medical rehabilitation across the translational research spectrum demand rigorous, interdisciplinary clinical trials of th highest quality. We define these key gaps in three, equally important domains: (i) the fundamental underpinnings of both disease pathobiology and rehabilitation efficacy; (ii) optimal intervention strategies - in a disease-specific and population-specific manner - that maximize function and life quality; (iii) mechanisms to achieve the ultimate translation to clinical practic and user engagement. With particular emphasis on chronic conditions such as stroke, brain or spinal cord injury, orthopedic and joint conditions, and developmental and degenerative disorders leading to disability, the overarching purpose of the proposed P2C National Resource Center for High-Impact Clinical Trials in Medical Rehabilitation is to catalyze high-impact, interdisciplinary clinical trials nationally that will: (i) reveal fundamental underpinnings; (ii) efine optimal intervention strategies; and (iii) streamline translation to clinical and community-based application. The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) is a leading-edge academic health center ideally positioned to achieve this stated purpose - with its unique depth and breadth of resources and collaborative expertise - complemented by a long-standing and extensive national network of partners to both support trials development and promote the Center's resources. The Center is carefully designed with an integrated research infrastructure - coordinating resources locally and nationally - that will significantly advance the field by encouraging medical rehabilitation researchers to take full advantage of specialized expertise and experience, an extensive menu of core resources and interdisciplinary research centers, and comprehensive study design and support services often not available through their local institutions or other organizations. This unique infrastructure will enable us to achieve the Center's purpose via the following specific aims: Aim 1. To advance the research of medical rehabilitation investigators nationally, we will provide effective consultative and/or educational services and collaborative arrangements that will facilitate all aspects of clinical trial design ad conduct, and competitive funding will be awarded nationally for innovative pilot projects needed to shape large-scale, definitive clinical trials (e.g., dosing trials, adaptive, delayed start, withdrawal and futility trials, and trials evaluating the interactions of complex mixtures of treatment modalities, etc.). Aim 2. To encourage medical rehabilitation researchers to take full advantage of the national resource Center's unique resources and expertise by effectively promoting and disseminating all of the Center's programs. Aim 3. To develop, validate, and provide state-of-the-art techniques and tools that will strengthen high-impact clinical trials nationally by enabling medical rehabilitation researchers to conduct more rigorous trials yielding higher quality data with potentially greater influence on clinical practice and health care deliver."

The CFAR is invigorated by the potential to develop and further explore these opportunities through closer collaborative interactions at Duke and across the CFAR network."
"9440047","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is the most common pediatric spinal deformity. To develop personalized prevention strategies for those at high risk and to eliminate screening and treatment of those at low risk of progression, accurate methods of predicting curve progression are needed. Unfortunately, currently available algorithms of curve progression for AIS are inaccurate, possibly because the role of rare genetic factors has been largely unexplored. By focusing on extreme cases with severe scoliosis (curve >40°), we recently completed a genome-wide rare variant burden analysis of exome sequence data of 91 cases and validated a significant enrichment of rare variants in FBN1 (fibrillin-1) and FBN2 (fibrillin-2) in AIS cases compared to controls. Furthermore, evidence of TGF-ß pathway activation was seen in paraspinous muscle of AIS patients with rare FBN1 variants, suggesting the possibility of novel treatments for AIS. However, additional studies are needed to identify the full complement of genetic risk factors for severe scoliosis, and to confirm a role for the TGF-ß pathway in its pathogenesis. The goal of this project is to identify genetic risk factors for sever AIS. Here, we propose a multicenter genome-wide rare variant association study of AIS, focusing on extreme cases of severe scoliosis that are likely enriched for genetic factors of large effect. This study utilizes DNA samples collected from five Bracing in Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis Trial (BrAIST) sites, and three new sites. A genome-wide rare variant association study will be performed on exome sequence data from 1000 severe AIS cases, followed by validation of the most highly associated variants/genes in AIS cases of both European and Han Chinese ancestry. Functional studies of AIS-associated rare variants will be evaluated using patient biobanked tissue, in vitro assessment of TGF-ß pathway activation, and generation of zebrafish mutants. Knowledge of the genetic risk factors for severe scoliosis is essential for accurate prediction of curve progression and development of new treatment strategies."
"9526718","?

Innovative research is necessary to curb this pandemic, which will require the training of new generations of multidisciplinary investigators. The proposed University of Maryland T32 training program in Diabetes and Its Metabolic Complications (DMC) will fulfill an unmet need for research training specifically focused on genomic approaches to diabetes from discovery to implementation into patient care. We request support for 2 pre- and 2 post-doctoral (PhD, MD or MD/PhD) fellows annually for 5 years to create a cadre of future leaders in diabetes translational genomics research. Our T32 curriculum focuses on three mutually informative research tracks to advance genomic discoveries to new mechanistic understandings to novel approaches for treatment and prevention of diabetes and its metabolic complications: 1) Genetics/genomics; 2) Pathophysiology of diabetes, metabolic syndrome, obesity, and their cardiovascular complications; and 3) Therapeutic strategies. Didactics will be required to fulfill core competencies in one of the three tracks; however the curriculum will provide sufficient flexibility to individualize to the specific interests and needs of each trainee. DMC trainees will be immersed in an intensive, comprehensive, mentored research experience. Our 16 DMC Training Grant faculty are experienced mentors, independent well-funded and productive investigators who work together in multidisciplinary teams that span genetics/genomics, molecular, cellular, and pathophysiological mechanisms of disease, translational research, and patient- and population-oriented research. The research environment and resources available to trainees in diabetes translational genomics research at the University of Maryland are substantial and include the NIH-funded Mid-Atlantic Nutrition Obesity Research Center (NORC) and the Baltimore Diabetes Research Center (DRC). One of the signature programs of DMC faculty is the Amish Genomics Research Program, which provides unprecedented opportunities for training and research in diabetes translational genomics. The DMC Training Program will be directed by Drs. Alan Shuldiner and Michael Quon. Implementation/development of our program including curriculum development, trainee selection from a large pool of highly qualified applicants, mentor pairing, tracking/guidance of trainees/mentors, and evaluation of the Training Program will be overseen by a Steering Committee, with programmatic oversight by Internal and External Advisory Committees. The DMC T32 Training Program will enable senior accomplished University of Maryland faculty to train, mentor, and nurture exceptional pre- and post-doctoral fellows for success in independent scholarly careers in biomedical research focused on diabetes translational genomics. Such training is essential for effectively addressing enormous public health/economic costs associated with diabetes and its metabolic complications."

"9295025","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bacteria adapt to changing environments in complex ways, for example by changing their programs of gene expression and by modifying or degrading proteins. Such regulatory events are vital for the survival of pathogens in the human body and their understanding is fundamental to both the control of infectious diseases and for our understanding of biology. The bacterium Bacillus subtilis is an important model organism, which continues to be intensively studied in a number of laboratories and which has contributed in important ways to the investigation of gene regulation. In particular, this organism undergoes a number of developmental adaptations to stress, including the activation of its ability to be transformed by environmental DNA, the formation of biofilms and of resistant spores. These adaptations involve decision making, and indeed a single B. subtilis culture contains cells that have undergone transitions to each of these states. This cell-type heterogeneity is probably for bet-hedging in the face of a changeable environment. Each of the developmental states mentioned above is relevant for public health. Transformation is important for the transfer of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes between bacteria, biofilms are of medical importance because some pathogens form biofilms in the human body, for example on in-dwelling catheters and sporulation is an essential part of the life cycle of the causative agent of anthrax and of clostridia, which causes tetanus. The present application concerns several of the most important mechanisms that regulate the transitions of a single cell to each of these adaptive states. Although this choice is random, the likelihood of each transition is highly regulated and dependent on environmental conditions. We will explore a number of transcription factors that are known to influence these likelihoods as well as the role of protein modification. We will place emphasis on the interrelationships among these adaptations, for example asking how cells become transformable in the context of biofilm formation. The logic of the signaling network that governs expression of the various adaptive states will be studied and the relevant molecular interactions will be investigated using genetic, biochemical, cell biological and genomic approaches. We will focus attention on the acetylation of several key proteins, the regulation of protein degradation and the control of protein phosphorylation as regulatory events."
"9308011","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a commonly occurring and seriously impairing disorder that occurs after exposure to traumatic events (TEs). Symptoms typically begin shortly after TE exposure and evolve with time to either chronicity or recovery. PTSD is one of the most preventable mental disorders, as many people exposed to TEs come to clinical attention in first response settings. Controlled clinical trials show that PTS risk can be significantly reduced by early preventive interventions. However, these interventions have nontrivial costs, making it infeasible to offer them to all persons exposed to TEs given that only a small minority goes on to develop PTSD. They are also unnecessary for many survivors who recovery spontaneously. To be cost-effective, risk prediction rules are needed to identify which exposed persons are at high risk of PTSD taking into consideration that predictors may vary between samples, within samples (e.g., between male and female survivors) and at different time lags from the TE. A number of research studies have collected longitudinal data addressing this issue by assessing potential predictors of PTSD among TE victims starting in first response healthcare settings, following participants over time, and using baseline data to predict subsequent PTSD. However, these studies' results have often been presented as changes in groups' average likelihood and were not synthesized in a way that would be practical, useful and predictive of individual risk. Therefore, we created a consortium of the principal investigators of the most important such studies to combine their individual- and item-level data towards carrying out a pooled secondary analysis to synthesize information about the predictors of PTSD. Our Specific Aims are: (1): To construct a consolidated dataset of individual-level data from 16 of the most important longitudinal studies of predictors of PTSD among TE victims starting in first response healthcare settings. These studies assessed a total of 6,390 respondents, 14% of whom have developed acute PTSD; (2): To estimate a latent growth mixture model (LGMM) of PTSD symptom trajectories in the roughly 92% of the consolidated sample (n = 5,917) assessed between one and three times after baseline with the CAPS and then to evaluate the sensitivity of model results to between-sample differences in trajectories and PTSD symptom measures; (3): To estimate the magnitude and cross-study consistency of associations between baseline predictors and PTSD outcomes (acute PTSD in the total sample; PTSD persistence among acute cases; LGMM PTSD class membership and symptom trajectories); (4): To use the results in Aim 3 to develop recommendations for the PTSD risk factors to be assessed in the future in first response settings along with software to facilitate systematic data collection and inform clinical decision making. We seek support to construct this consolidated dataset, to carry out and report the results of analyses, and to develop a risk prediction tool that can be used in first response settings."

The long term potential of precision medicine to improve drug treatment and prevention depends on gaining a much better understanding how genetics, drugs, brain cells, and neuronal circuitry interact to influence behavior. There are serious technical barriers that prevent researchers and clinicians from incorporating more powerful computational and predictive methods in addiction research. The purpose of the NIDA P30 Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome is to empower and train researchers supported by NIH, NIDA, NIAAA, and other federal and state institutions to use more quantitative and testable ways to analyze genetic, epigenetic, and the environmental factors that influence drug abuse risk and treatment. The Administrative Core manages relations among research cores, groups of users, trainees, and pilot program participants. The Transcriptome Informatics and Mechanisms research core assembles and analyzes hundreds of large genome (DNA) and transcriptome (RNA) datasets for experimental rodent (rat) models of addiction. The Systems Analytics and Modeling research core is using innovative systems genetics methods to understand the linkage between DNA differences, environmental risks such as stress, and the differential risk of drug abuse and relapse. The Pilot core is catalyzing new collaborations among young investigator in the field of addiction research. In sum the Center is a national resource for more reproducible research in addiction. We are centralizing, archiving, distributing, analyzing and integrating high quality data, metadata, using open software systems in collaboration with many other teams of researchers. Our goal is to help build toward an NIDA Addictome Portal that will include all genomic research relevant to addiction research."
"9301621","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infants are at increased risk for serious complications from influenza, with morbidity rates exceeding even adults >65 years. Unfortunately, influenza vaccines are ineffective in infants <6 months of age. This biologically vulnerable group relies on maternal antibody for protection. Public health officials advocate maternal immunization; however, there is no data on which type of maternal influenza vaccine best protects infants. We seek to compare maternal response to the systemic inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) and the intranasal live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). Because the lactating mammary gland is part of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, we hypothesize that mucosally-administered LAIV will elicit higher levels of anti-influenza immunity in breast milk than vaccination with the injeced TIV. We will evaluate levels of influenza-specific antibodies and cellular immunity in blood and breast milk. We also will compare levels of influenza-specific responses in TIV and LAIV recipients. Finally, we will perform gene expression experiments to identify gene expression patterns induced after vaccination to further understand differences in innate and adaptive immune responses. Our data will provide a comprehensive analysis of the mechanisms underlying immune protection during breastfeeding. Moreover, the experience and knowledge gained from this proposal will lay the foundation for an R01 application for support for further investigations of how to optimize this maternal vaccination strategy for the protection of infants against influenza and other infectious diseases."

"9304880","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Existing studies of middle childhood suggest that some children with ASD show significant improvements in IQ and other aspects of cognitive functioning during this period, while others stabilize or fall further behind. With the increased availability of intensive early intervention, it is not clear that findings from these older studie are applicable to children with ASD now. Given that cognitive abilities developed through early and middle childhood provide a critical foundation for later competencies, and are the strongest predictors of adolescent and adult outcomes, the lack of clarity about cognitive development during middle childhood constitutes a significant gap in our understanding of ASD. To close this gap we propose to conduct a longitudinal study of individuals with ASD that focuses on middle childhood in a well-characterized cohort of children from the UC Davis MIND Institute Autism Phenome Project (APP). One hundred and eighty nine toddlers with ASD and 90 with typical development (TYP) were assessed during early childhood (at 2-3.5 years or T1). A subset of these children received additional behavioral assessments when they were 5-6.5 years old (T2) and provide pilot data for the application. In the proposed study, we will reassess the original cohort of 279 when they reach middle childhood (at 8-10 years or T3). In Aim #1 we will a) examine cognitive functioning; and b) identify distinct developmental trajectories of intellectual functioning/IQ between early and middle childhood and predictors of membership in these trajectories. We hypothesize that they will show 3 trajectories of intellectual development based on our pilot data and the literature. These include the: 1) the Stable Low developmental trajectory; 2) the Stable High developmental trajectory; and 3) the Changers developmental trajectory. We hypothesize that membership in the Stable High group at T3, will be predicted by better executive attentional control and fewer autism-related social affect symptoms at T1; and that membership in the Changers group at T3, vs. the Stable Low group, will be predicted by the absence of regression and fewer autism-related communication symptoms at T1. In Aim #2, we test 2 mechanistic models of how intensive early intervention might promote positive middle childhood functioning in individuals with ASD. These include the Hippocampal Compensation Model, which proposes that in some children intervention promotes neuroplasticity of the hippocampus which then leads to improvements in memory, IQ, and academic functioning in middle childhood and the Social Attention Model, which suggests that in children with better academic, social, and adaptive functioning at T3 there will be a positive association between intensity of early intervention, and executive attentional control and social communication development. This application addresses IACC Strategic Plan Questions 2 and 4; and the NIMH RDoC recommendation to study executive attentional control."
"9348591","PROJECT SUMMARY During the last decade the Johns Hopkins Division of Rheumatology has prioritized the development of longitudinal patient cohorts across seven disease-specific Centers of Excellence, with comprehensive clinical, diagnostic, lab, patient-reported, and imaging data, and biospecimens to facilitate discovery. These datasets have now matured to allow greater insight into how multiple factors influence the development and progression of rheumatic diseases and variation in treatment responses. Statistical methods to evaluate and interpret longitudinal data have advanced substantially in recent years, especially for identifying relevant subgroups of patients and predicting trajectories of disease progression and responses to therapy. Many of these methods were developed by members of our team and are only just beginning to be applied to medicine. The Specific Aims of the Data Science Core are to: 1) Provide data analytical support throughout the research process that will enable investigators to generate, manage, analyze, and interpret data using modern statistical methods; 2) Develop and apply Bayesian hierarchical models (BHMs) to longitudinal cohorts bringing together with diverse sources of data to identify patient subsets predictive of different trajectories of outcomes and responses to treatments; and 3) Apply modern analytic approaches to observational and experimental studies that rigorously address heterogeneity among individuals in their responses to treatments. The Data Science Core will be led by Dr. Scott Zeger who pioneered advances in longitudinal data analysis methods, and leads the transformative Hopkins inHealth Initiative. The Data Science Core will optimize its impact and maximize productivity and efficiency by embedding biomedical data science faculty within each of our Centers of Excellence. We are confident that by working together, our clinician scientists and biomedical data scientists (biostatisticians) can accelerate the pace of research discoveries by analyzing our rich datasets carefully collected over time with new advances in statistical modeling to identify multiple factors that influence the onset and course of rheumatic diseases and better predict individual responses to different treatments that in turn can help guide evidence-based clinical practice."
"9306935","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Developmental bladder defects can lead to numerous health problems throughout life including pediatric kidney failure, urinary tract infections, stone, and urinary retention; however, genetic determinants of bladder diseases are largely unknown. The application's broad long-term objectives are to elucidate the molecular control of bladder development to develop effective therapies for structural bladder disease. Presently, most of the molecular control of bladder development is unknown. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (Fgfr2) is expressed in developing bladder mesenchyme (future muscle and lamina propria); however, global deletion of Fgfr2 in mice leads to early embryonic lethality prior to the onset of urinary tract development, making the roles of the receptor in bladder development unclear. To circumvent the early lethality of the global knockouts, a Tbx18cre line was used to conditionally delete Fgfr2 in the bladder mesenchyme (Fgfr2BM-/-). Preliminary data show that while Fgfr2BM-/- embryonic bladders total bladder volumes are unchanged, the mutants have a relative reduction in the volume of the outer condensing mesenchyme (future muscle) and a decrease in muscle marker expression vs. controls. Conversely, Fgfr2BM-/- bladders have a relative increase in volume of the inner mesenchyme (future lamina propria) and higher expression of early collagen markers with infiltration into the muscle. Early postnatal mutant bladders have histological abnormalities and functional defects including decreases in contractility, poor compliance, and high pressures; aged Fgfr2BM-/- mice develop severe bladder distention with fibrosis and myogenic failure (resembling atonic bladders) and also develop kidney injury. Mechanistically, Fgfr2BM-/- embryonic bladders appear to have increased sonic hedgehog (Shh) activity (and other pathways downstream of hedgehog such as Wnt and Bmp4), which likely mispatterns the mesenchyme. Fgfr2 suppression of hedgehog appears to by regulation of Hh co-receptors Cdon and Boc. Finally preliminary bladder culture experiments suggest a rescue of mutant bladder muscle defects with low doses of a hedgehog inhibitor. The overarching hypothesis is that loss of Fgfr signaling in bladder mesenchyme leads to early developmental patterning defects that have significant postnatal consequences. To test the hypothesis, the following aims are proposed: Aim1: Characterize the progressive histological, functional, and signaling defects in Fgfr2BM-/- bladders. Structural and molecular bladder mispatterning will be interrogated in Fgfr2BM-/- embryos and newborn mice. Structural and functional consequences of developmental bladder mispatterning will be determined in postnatal mice. Signaling defects downstream of Fgfr2 will also be characterized in mutant bladders. Aim 2: Determine the molecular mechanisms driving the patterning defects in the Fgfr mutants. Perturbations in hedgehog signaling (and other potential pathways downstream of hedgehog such as Bmp4 and Wnt) will be interrogated in embryonic Fgfr2BM-/- bladders. Chemical and genetic approaches will be used ex vivo and in vivo to attempt rescue of bladder defects in Fgfr2BM-/- mice."
"9294988","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive renewal application to continue training postdoctoral fellows in nephrology research. Our goal is to prepare fellows for a career in Academic Nephrology by training them to use state-of-the-art basic or clinical investigative tools and methods to interrogate important issues in renal physiology and pathophysiology. We will continue to rely on an interdisciplinary approach that involves 20 preceptors from the Renal Division and from the Departments of Immunology, Pediatrics, Physiology, Radiology, and Transplant Surgery, and from the Divisions of Digestive Diseases and Geriatrics. Training is offered in four focus areas: 1) renal tubular physiology; 2) metabolic consequences of renal dysfunction; 3) clinical, translational, and epidemiological research; and 4) transplantation and immunology. Each of the preceptors has an outstanding training record and research funding from the NIH and/or VA. By providing trainees with relevant formal and informal scientific courses and a variety of career development activities while simultaneously immersing them in specific research projects, this program will provide a solid foundation on which to build a career  in Academic Medicine. Two categories of trainees will be chosen: 1) MDs or MD/PhDs from the adult/pediatric Renal Fellowship programs; and 2) PhD candidates. Over the past 10 years, there have been 16 trainees supported by this grant: 6 are full-time medical school faculty members engaged in basic or clinical research; 1 is a health scientist at the CDC; 6 continue to be engaged in full-time research training; 1 is teaching chemistry at a state university; and 2 have entered nephrology practice. Thus, 7 of the 10 trainees (70%) who completed all of their training during 2005-2015 entered academic medicine and are currently full-time faculty members at a medical school or at the CDC. Three of them have received research grants from the NIH or other sources of funding, a 4th has a pending grant application, and a 5th is a CDC scientist funded by intramural CDC funds. Three of the 6 trainees who are still engaged in research training have pending NIH K-grant applications. During the past 10 years, 9 women and 6 members of an under- represented minority group have received support from this T32. Fifteen of 16 trainees have published peer-reviewed papers. We have filled every available position every year since the start of this program in 1990. We seek funding to continue this successful training program."
"9517371","PROJECT SUMMARY Our long-term goal is to develop safe and effective drugs to treat obesity. The proposed studies are aimed at validating a new target, ALDH1A1, the major enzyme involved in generating retinoic acid (RA) in adipose tissues, for the treatment of obesity. RA is synthesized by three main aldehyde dehydrogenases, ALDH1A1, ALDH1A2, and ALDH1A3 that are expressed in temporally and spatially distinctive patterns and are involved in processes including development, reproduction and immunity. RA also regulates expression of genes involved in adipose tissue differentiation as well as glucose and lipid metabolism. During our efforts to develop male contraceptives using small molecules that reduce RA synthesis in the testes, we observed that mice treated with WIN 18,446, a pan-inhibitor of ALDH1A isozymes, had lower body weight gain due to a decrease in adipose tissue mass. This attenuated weight gain was reversed by co-treatment with RA, suggesting that ALDH1A inhibition (RA reduction) could be used for weight regulation. Thus, we tested the efficacy of RA synthesis inhibition using a murine model of diet-induced obesity and found that WIN 18,446 is effective in attenuating weight gain despite the animals? continued consumption of a high fat diet. Others have demonstrated that the absence of the RA synthesizing enzyme, Aldh1a1, alters energy metabolism in liver and adipose tissues due to changes in tissue retinoid levels (RA and retinal) and thus, protecting mice against diet- induced obesity. We hypothesize that pharmacological inhibition of RA biosynthesis by inactivating ALDH1A1 is a novel target for the treatment of obesity. To test this, in Specific Aim 1, we will evaluate efficacy and toxicity of WIN 18,446 as an obesity treatment and will additionally determine potential mechanisms, including alterations in energy metabolism in liver, adipose tissues and muscles, increased thermogenesis in adipose tissue and effects on adipogenesis. Retinoid concentrations and the expression pattern of the three RA synthesis enzymes will also be examined in human visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues to determine whether differences in RA homeostasis (retinal and RA concentrations) correlate with body mass index in humans. Although WIN 18,446 is a promising compound for weight regulation, its inhibition of all three RA synthesis enzymes and other ALDH enzymes has been shown to cause unwanted side effects such as inhibition of spermatogenesis and alcohol toxicity. In Specific Aim 2, we propose to develop ALDH1A1 specific inhibitors to treat obesity, minimizing the potential side effects associated with complete inhibition of retinoic acid synthesis. In Specific Aim 3, we will test the efficacy of our new ALDH1A1- specific inhibitors for the treatment of obesity in mice. The proposed studies will identify a novel target to treat obesity with the potential to improve metabolic abnormalities associated with obesity."
"9380596","ABSTRACT In the US there are ~750,000 heart attacks (acute myocardial infarctions) a year, and ~300,000 patients undergo scheduled cardiac ischemia during cardiac surgery. Beyond reperfusion itself, there are no FDA- approved interventions to limit myocardial injury due to ischemia and reperfusion (IR). This renewal proposal is part of an ongoing program to elucidate mitochondrial & metabolic events in IR and exploit this knowledge to develop small molecule cardioprotective therapies. Our focus is the interplay between acid pH and metabolism in the ischemic heart, based on the following discoveries: (i) SIRT1 is required for cardioprotection and protective metabolic remodeling. (ii) Among the metabolites regulated by SIRT1 is 2- hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), a hypoxic signaling molecule. (iii) We have found a novel mechanism by which SIRT1 can affect metabolism - impacting cardiomyocyte pH via signaling to NHE1. (iv) Acidosis in ischemia is cardioprotective, but the mechanisms are poorly defined. We have discovered key metabolic events in ischemia are triggered by direct effects of acid on metabolic enzymes. (v) We propose 2-HG activates Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF) and inhibits the necrosis mediator Alk-B homolog 7 (ALKBH7). (vi) It is thought that reversal of mitochondrial complex II (Cx-II) drives accumulation of succinate, which then drives pathologic ROS generation at reperfusion. However, new data suggest poor consensus on the mechanism of succinate accumulation, its possible roles in ischemia, and its regulation by pH. Overall, we hypothesize that SIRT1 enhances ischemic acidosis, triggering cardioprotective metabolic events including 2-HG and succinate accumulation. This hypothesis will be tested through pursuit of the following specific aims? Aim 1 will investigate the mechanism by which SIRT1 enhances ischemic acidosis. Aim 2 will investigate mechanisms by which acid and 2-HG signal cardioprotection. Aim 3 will investigate the mechanism(s) of ischemic succinate accumulation and the timing of Cx-II inhibition for therapeutic benefit. These studies will use adult cardiomyocytes, perfused hearts, the in-vivo LAD occlusion model of IR injury, and engineered mice including Alkbh7-/- and cardiac specific Sirt1-/-. We will also employ novel pharmacologic agents (Cx-II inhibitors and cell-permeable 2-HG analogs), fluorescent pH imaging, LC-MS/MS based metabolomics, and 13C dynamic labeling metabolomics. This work will advance fundamental knowledge on ischemic cardiac metabolism, will develop small molecule therapies, and will offer mechanistic insight applicable to multiple tissues and pathologies."
"9304772","?    DESCRIPTION: Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is the second highest cause of liver transplants in the United States, yet the mechanisms that underlie ethanol-induced liver damage remain poorly understood. Clinical studies of ALD recognize intestinal dysfunction as a critical player in the progression of disease. Chronic ethanol consumption induces transient losses in the intestinal barrier, which correlate with significant increases in circulating microbial byproducts such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Increases in LPS are associated with activation of toll like receptor 4 (TLR4), which stimulates the release of inflammatory cytokines from intestinal and liver resident macrophages, and results in the dysfunction of the liver parenchyma. Cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP), a global inducer of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), inhibits the production of inflammatory cytokines in Kupffer cells and significantly reduces markers of liver injury. However, CoPP also induces HO-1 in the hepatocytes and the intestinal epithelium. Preliminary data in caco-2 cells suggest that epithelial HO-1 expression protects tight junctions. We hypothesize that the induction of HO-1 within the intestinal epithelium protects the liver from inflammation and damage by preserving the function of the intestinal tight junctions during ethanol feeding. To investigate the role of HO-1 in maintaining the intestinal barrier, the localization of tight junctions will be determined in the jejunum, ileum, proximal, and distal colo. The modified lactulose-mannitol test will be used to assess permeability of the fore, mid, and hindgut. Barrier measurements will be compared with circulating endotoxin to determine the impact of global HO-1 induction on endotoxin translocation. To determine the impact of epithelial HO-1 on liver protection, conditional HO-1 knockout mice will be generated for the intestinal epithelium, and the HO-1 will be induced with CoPP during the chronic ethanol diet. Hepatocyte, and monocyte conditional HO-1 knockouts will be generated to determine the impact of HO-1 in the liver parenchyma. The permeability of caco-2 monolayers in response to ethanol will be determined under conditions with or without CoPP and compared with the localization and relative expression of tight junction proteins. The impact of HO-1 on tight junctions will be determined by treating with inhibitors of HO-1 expression or enzymatic activity. HO-1 catalyzes the degradation of heme into carbon monoxide, biliverdin, and molecular iron, which is associated with upregulation of ferritin heavy chain. The impact of these products on the localization of tight junctions and barrier permeability will be determined using pharmacologic inhibitors, overexpression plasmids, shRNA and scrambled controls. During these experiments, the transepithelial electrical resistance, immunohistochemistry and FITC-dextran permeability assays will be used to assess barrier function."

The field of MI represents a fusion of diverse scientific fields, including imaging technologies, molecular biology, and chemistry, that is providing major new insights and advances to the scientific community. The World Molecular Imaging Society (WMIS) embodies the field of MI as an organization dedicated to developing and promoting preclinical and clinical imaging of various types at the atomic level, to understand and effectively treat often life-threatening diseases of a variety of specialties, such as in oncology, infectious disease, neurology, cardiology, rheumatology, and endocrinology. A distinguishing feature of our society is the highly-integrated, multimodal approach that spans from scientific innovation to patient care in the clinic. As an international scientific educational organization, active members of WMIS include basic and translational scientists, clinicians, young researchers and students from a wide variety of disciplines, with a dedicated common goal to the understanding of biology and medicine through multimodal in vivo imaging of cellular and molecular events involved in normal and pathologic processes and utilization of quantitative MI in patient care. The annual World Molecular Imaging Congress (WMIC) is held for WMIS members and non-members interested in the field, who come from both academics and industry, and is the only comprehensive, international meeting of MI. Indeed, the WMIC is the epitome of MI that provides a platform for scientists and clinicians with diverse backgrounds to interact, present, and discuss and follow cutting-edge advances. The WMIS is actively seeking mechanisms to maintain the impetus and rapid trajectories of this multidisciplinary transformative field, in particular, by securing travel funds for post-doctoral fellows and graduate students. These individuals will play future roles in deciding how MI is utilized in healthcare. The goal of this R13 is to obtain specific funds to cover costs that support the attendance of students at the graduate and postdoctoral levels, especially encouraging women, underrepresented minorities and persons with disabilities, enabling their attendance to the annual WMIC, next year in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on September 13-16, 2017."
"9372889","Abstract The overall goal of this proposal is to develop systems for efficient ex vivo maturation of functional human red blood cells (RBCs), which holds tremendous potential for addressing supply bottlenecks for delivering new therapeutic options to chronically transfused patients with severe alloimmunization and for novel strategies for delivering therapeutics via engineered RBCs. No approaches developed so far have shown the ability to produce both enucleated and mature RBCs that have reliable shelf-life in storage or viability upon transfusion. Our hypothesis is that in existing culture systems, late stage erythroblasts/early reticulocytes lose too much surface area during enucleation and membrane remodeling, leading to more spherical cells that are susceptible to hemolysis. We propose a biomimetic approach wherein cells are passed through microslit filters to recapitulate in vivo mechanical deformations that appropriately constrain cell area/volume, promote proper biconcave disc morphology and limit potentially harmful extensional stretching. This proposal brings together expertise in microfabrication at SiMPore Inc. with RBC biology and rheology at the University of Rochester. SiMPore will optimize micro-slit manufacturing methods and integrate microslit filter membranes into fluidic systems for RBC maturation testing at Rochester (Aim 1). Similar efforts will be carried out to test the capability of microslit filters to separate and concentrate mature/enucleated RBCs from nucleated precursors (Aim 2). Relevant experts will guide developing regulatory and commercialization plans so that the team is positioned to carry out clinical studies during Phase II. The developed RBC maturation tools can be married with existing large volume bioreactors for RBC precursor expansion so that final maturation using this approach can be scaled for practical volumes."

"9328474","Project Summary My long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator conducting research in the neurobiological basis for language processing in a research university. I propose to attain this goal through a study of language comprehension in a real-world context that extends beyond decoding the traditional phonetic, semantic, and syntactic components of speech. To fully appreciate speaker meaning, listeners must often engage in additional inferential processes. In natural conversation, this includes the use of indirect speech acts to communicate. Consider, for example, if John asks Mark, ?Do you want some cake for dessert?? and Mark replies, ?I am on a diet.? In this exchange, John can infer that Mark does not want dessert, even though it is not explicitly stated. The proposed project will use advanced neuroimaging techniques to examine the neural networks that support processing indirect speech acts such as this one. Hypothesis: Historically, the core language network is thought to consist of two main processing hubs located in left hemisphere peri-Sylvian cortex: the inferior frontal gyrus and the posterior superior temporal gyrus. However, these initial studies were based primarily on assessments of single word and sentence processing. I hypothesize that high-level language comprehension in a conversational context engages additional neural networks typically associated with social cognition and executive function. Aim 1: Characterize the patterns of neural activity and functional connectivity supporting indirect speech act processing in young adults using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Aim 2: Obtain converging evidence for the neuroanatomic basis of indirect speech act comprehension by studying patients with focal neurodegenerative disease due to frontotemporal dementia using structural magnetic resonance imaging. The experiments proposed here will provide the necessary knowledge to lead an independent laboratory investigating the neurobiology of language. The proposed work will aid in characterizing the functional architecture of the language system with converging evidence from healthy and populations with a focal dementia. Improved understanding of brain circuitry supporting high-level language comprehension has important implications for theories of language processing and future treatment studies using neuromodulatory techniques like TMS or tDCS to improve language performance in communicatively impaired populations. Validated assessment of elements of functional communication such as indirect speech acts has important implications for safety and quality of life in patient populations.! !"
"9288234","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is one of nine late-onset neurodegenerative diseases caused by the expansion of a polyglutamine (CAG) repeat. In the case of SCA1, the pathogenic glutamine expansion affects ataxin-1 (ATXN1), a protein that plays a role in transcriptional repression. We and others have found that in SCA1 genetic mouse models, mutant ATXN1 alters gene expression as early as two weeks after birth, long before behavioral signs and other pathological events become evident. Given the early nature of these transcriptional aberrations, we predicted that altered expression of a few key genes plays a mediatory role in pathogenesis. In the course of testing this prediction, we made the unexpected discovery that ATXN1 directly regulates the expression of the angiogenic and neurotrophic cytokine VEGF and that its levels are abnormally low in the SCA1 mouse brain. Following up on this observation, we discovered that genetically increasing VEGF levels mitigates the SCA1 phenotype in the well-characterized SCA1 knock-in mouse (SCA1154Q/2Q; Q=glutamine), the best existing mouse model of SCA1. We have also demonstrated in preliminary proof-of-principle experiments that VEGF delivered pharmacologically (by intraventricular delivery of recombinant VEGF) improves the cerebellar aspects of the SCA1 phenotype, specifically the hallmark ataxia and the cerebellar dendritic pathology. Motivated by these promising results, we wish to test two related hypotheses: that VEGF is an important cytokine for maintaining neurovascular health in the context of SCA1, and that VEGF has the potential to serve as therapy for this otherwise untreatable disease. We hope that these studies will provide mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of SCA1 and also help design clinical trials for this disease. An important ancillary outcome of these studies is that they would shed light on the basic biology of VEGF in the nervous system and provide clues to its role in other neurodegenerative syndromes."

"9325533","This project within the P01 will advance scientific understanding ofthe potential environmental etiologies of  birth defects and preterm birth, which will undoubtedly have important implications for risk assessment and  prevention of these common, costly, and often deadly outcomes of pregnancy. In this project we propose  the following research-based aims: 1) To determine whether exposures to specific air pollutants (identified in  our P20 research) are further modified by gene variants in biotransformation enzymes (e.g., NATs, GSTs,  CYPH, or NOS3) for risk of selected birth defects. 2) To determine whether ambient exposures to polycyclic  aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), during critical periods of organogenesis, are associated with women  delivering infants/fetuses with birth defects, and whether relationships are further modified by gene variants  in Aim 1. 3) To determine whether ambient exposures to PAHs, during critical periods of gestation, are  associated with women delivering preterm, and 4) To determine whether the built environment is associated  with preterm birth either directly or indirectly through a joint effect with ambient air pollution. Our proposed  project is highly significant and innovative, it will be accomplished by a highly experienced group of  investigators in a rigorous way, will capitalize on the intellectual capacity and resources of our existing  Center (P20) as well as a new transdisciplinary research Center at Stanford devoted exclusively to studying  prematurity, and will substantially move forward our scientific understanding of a specific source of  environmental toxicants - air pollutants, and sentinel indicators of pediatric health - birth defects and  preterm birth. No study on birth defects or spontaneous preterm birth and air pollution exposures has been  done on the population scale we are proposing. This project will substantially move forward our scientific  understanding of a specific source of environmental toxicants - air pollutants, and sentinel indicators of  pediatric health - birth defects and preterm birth. This study's results will have obvious practical significance  for women of reproductive age in the US because the study addresses individuals' risk at a very basic and  potentially avoidable level, i.e., potential exposures where we live."
"9382725","Abstract Pancreatitis is an inflammatory disease of the pancreas which results in significant morbidity and mortality. When exposed to a noxious stimulus, pancreas initially responds with an acute reaction characterized by intense local and systemic inflammation termed acute pancreatitis (AP). While in most patients the pancreas recovers from AP without any residual deficit, in some patients, due to ongoing injury or for unclear reasons, continued inflammation leads to chronic fibro-inflammatory changes in the pancreas, an entity termed chronic pancreatitis (CP). Despite decades of research there is no specific therapy for acute or chronic pancreatitis. Since acute and chronic pancreatitis represent two ends of a continuum of inflammation, strategies targeting inflammation should lead to development of novel therapies for this disease. In this regards pirfenidone, a novel small anti-inflammatory molecule has been developed as a treatment for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). While pirfenidone is approved for clinical use only in IPF, preclinical studies have shown that it has anti-fibrotic activity in models of liver and kidney fibrosis as well. Furthermore, by virtue of its anti-inflammatory properties, pirfenidone has demonstrated protective activity in models of acute inflammation as well. However, the efficacy of pirfenidone against acute or chronic pancreatitis has never been evaluated. Intriguingly our preliminary data suggest that therapeutic treatment with pirfenidone, i.e. when delivered after initiation of injury, attenuates local and systemic inflammation in acute pancreatitis and decreases fibrosis in chronic pancreatitis. In the translational aims of the current proposal the efficacy of pirfenidone will be evaluated in multiple models of acute and chronic pancreatitis to generate pre-clinical data for future clinical trial. Given that no specific therapy for AP or CP exists and that pirfenidone is already in clinical use, these studies have immediate clinical relevance. The mechanism of action of pirfenidone is unclear. Our preliminary data suggest that pirfenidone increases regulatory T cells (Tregs). In multiple acute and chronic inflammatory diseases, Tregs have been shown to attenuate inflammation, improve disease severity and help in recovery. Based on our preliminary data we have put forward a novel hypothesis that pirfenidone attenuates severity of acute and chronic pancreatitis by augmenting Treg population. The role of Tregs in pathophysiology of acute and chronic pancreatitis and their role in the efficacy of pirfenidone have never been studied before. Successful execution of the proposed studies will provide novel insight into pathogenesis of pancreatitis and identification of novel drug targets."

Gonzales, Ph.D. Sr. Research Associate  Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Co-investigator ABSTRACT The Cell Culture and Animal Husbandry Core laboratory will serve as a source for biologic materials for the Program Project. It will provide cell culture facilities and expertise as well as animal husbandry service. Specifically, the Core will isolate primary cells for culture and maintain various cell lines. Type II cells will be the principal primary cell type prepared. The alveolar cells will be isolated from the lungs of adult rats, adult mice and neonatal rats and from human and mouse fetal lung tissue using well-characterized methodology which retain or recover important features of alveolar type II cells, especially those related to surfactant metabolism. In addition, the Core will provide support for the maintenance of the four mutant mice colonies planned, including documentation and coordination for the breeding of the gene-targeted mice. The Core is located in the main IFEM laboratory and contains all equipment necessary for cell maintenance and propagation including incubators, laminar flow hoods, inverted microscopes, a sterile room, and an autoclave. In addition, we have a subcontract with Children's Hospital of Pennsylvania (CHOP) for the purchase and preparation of human fetal lung type II cells. The"

"8106539","The assembly of triadyglycerol-rich lipoproteins (TAG-LP) involves the initial formation of a small HDL sized  primordial particle with a neutral lipid core and a later process which adds TAG and phospholipid (PL) to  create nascent VLDL. The N-terminal 20.5% of apoB(B0.5) has homology to lipovitellin (LV) that consists of  an N-terminal beta barrel, a region of 17 amphipathic alpha helices (AaH) and 2 beta sheet domains, the A and C  sheets. Proper folding of the N-terminal is necessary for secretion since certain point mutations and failure  to form disulfide bonds target it to degradation. Limited proteolysis of 617 and B20.5 indicates that apoB  homology to LV is approximate but not exact. Structural determination of isolated proteolytic and expressed  domains using CD, NMR and X-ray diffraction will define B20.5 domains at the molecular level. The  assembly with lipids as driven by the primary sequence of apoB is studied in MTP-deficient C127 cells  transfected with C-terminally truncated forms. The role of molecular chaperones in folding, lipidation and in  quality control is studied both in C127 and hepatoma-derived cells. The region from B20.5 to B29 recruits  surface molecules, mainly PL to the nascent particle. As the peptide lengthens from B20.5 to B29 the  number of surface molecules increases from approximately 5 to about 70 per particle. The sequence between B32 and B41 recruits almost 200 TAG (about 1 TAG/2.3 aa) which form nascent particles with a cryo-EM discernable core  which is not seen in B32.5. Biophysical analysis shows that B37 and B41 peptides must interact directly with  the core. This region contains 24 amphipathic beta strands (ApS) 12-15 aa long. Consensus 12 aa ApS and  27 aa p sheet peptides bind to oil/water (O/W) interfaces, are elastic and are not displaced at high pressure.  ApoB also contains 2 major regions a2 and a3 of AaH. Consensus AaH peptides bind to O/W and air/water  interfaces, but are ejected at a critical pressure into the aqueous phase. Native apoB also binds to the  TAG/W interface and cannot be fully displaced by high pressure, but parts of the apoB come off when  compressed and snap back on rapidly when the surfaces are again expanded. Thus, we suggest the flexible  parts of apoB are AaH and the non-exchangeable part is AbetaS. This project dissects the complex pathway by  which bad cholesterol (apoB associated cholesterol, VLDL, LDL) is made and secreted by the liver. The  long term goal is to find procedures or drugs to reduce bad cholesterol, heart attack and stroke."
"9207543","MUCOSAL IMMUNOLOGY CORE  PROJECT SUMMARY HIV is spread primarily via vaginal or rectal sexual transmission. In addition, the gut is a privileged site of HIV replication and a primary reservoir of virus that persists even during therapy with potent antiretroviral drugs. Furthermore, mucosal dysfunction during HIV infection is associated with morbidities and mortality. Considerable effort is now focused on novel therapeutic drugs, microbicides, and vaccines that can target the virus in the mucosal compartment. However, the tools, assays, and methods to access and study mucosal tissues and cells in non-human primates (NHP) are not yet adequate to meet the growing need to study this compartment. This project will develop resources required for the HIV research community to study the impact of antiretroviral drugs, microbicides, and vaccines on immune responses and the microbiota in different mucosal compartments in the NHP model. We also propose to develop a novel NHP specimen repository consisting of purified lymphocytes isolated from a wide range of tissues with an emphasis on mucosal tissues to support pilot studies and expand access to NHP samples in the research community without the need to purchase animals. Our specific aims will: 1) Optimize and refine methods and procedures to investigate mucosal immune responses in nonhuman primates, 2) establish a NHP specimen repository of lymphocytes isolated from various mucosal and systemic immune compartments in infected and uninfected nonhuman primates and 3) develop new resources that can be used to investigate the role of mucosal immunity and the microbiome in protection and pathogenesis in nonhuman primates. Together, these aims will establish new state-of-art resources and methods to investigate mucosal immunity and the microbiome in HIV disease, prevention and cure in nonhuman primates."
"9488851","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Ng) is the causative agent of the sexually transmitted infection (STI), gonorrhea. Gonococcal infection has become resistant to almost every antibiotic that has been used. Ng has achieved superbug status and represents a global public health problem. Novel therapies against Ng are urgently needed. Ng lipooligosaccharide (LOS) modulates several aspects of virulence. Ng possess a LOS sialyltransferase (Lst) enzyme that scavenges CytidineMonophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-Neu5Ac; Neu5Ac is a nonulosonate [NulO] that belongs to the `sialic acid' family) from the host to sialylate its LOS. Two glycan extensions from heptose I of LOS can be sialylated: i) the lacto-N-neotetraose structure and ii) the less frequently encountered PK-like LOS. LOS Neu5Ac confers on Ng the ability to evade complement (C'), cationic antimicrobial peptides and neutrophils. Prior studies have shown that there is strong pressure in vivo for Ng to express `sialylatable' LOS. We have shown that Ng Lst is promiscuous and can `cap' Ng LOS with analogs of neuraminic and legionaminic acids. Of the five CMP-NulOs that capped LOS, incorporation of Neu5Ac9Az (Az [azido]) and Leg5Ac7Ac (Leg) not only failed to confer on Ng the ability to resist C', but also prevented the `physiologic' Neu5Ac from exerting its C' inhibitoy effects. Intravaginal treatment of mice with CMP- Leg5Ac7Ac significantly attenuated Ng infection. These exciting data show that disabling the physiologic `Ng sialic acid machinery' cripples its virulence. This proposal aims to advance the development of CMP-NulOs as a topical prophylactic against multidrug-resistant Ng. In Aim 1 we will test the efficacy in vivo of CMP- Leg5Ac7Ac against i) additional contemporary drug-resistant Ng and ii) Ng that express the `alternative sialylatable' (PK-like) LOS in the mouse vaginal colonization model. In Aim 2 we will examine whether CMP- NulO-treated cells express NulOs, which could be recognized as `foreign' by Ab and result in tissue damage. In the second (R33) phase of this proposal, CMP-Leg5Ac7Ac dose optimization studies will be performed in Aim 3. In Aim 4 we will define the arm(s) of the immune system that facilitates clearance of infection by CMP- Leg5Ac7Ac, using mice deficient in C3, cationic peptides (CRAMP KO), PMN-depleted or Rag 1 KO mice. The effects of NulO incorporation by Ng LOS on the interaction of Ng with relevant human Siglecs will also be examined. Aim 5 will examine the efficacy of CMP-NulOs in the context of chlamydia co-infection, a common clinical occurrence. Chlamydia increases Ng disease burden in mice and also enhances the likelihood of women acquiring Ng. Ng infection is host-restricted. Ng binds to the C' inhibitors factor H (FH) and C4b-binding protein (C4BP) in a human specific manner, which results in selective resistance of human complement by Ng. Further, unlike all other mammals that possess both Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc, humans possess only Neu5Ac. In Aim 6, we will use human FH/C4BP double transgenic mice, and CMP-Neu5Ac hydroxylase KO mice (make only Neu5Ac, similar to humans) to test the efficacy of CMP-NulOs in a more human-specific context."
"9456370","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol abuse and alcoholism are significant health problems that affect over 17 million people and cost nearly $200 billion annually. It is likely tha a solution to these problems will result from a better understanding of alcohol effects on neuronal ion channels and the proteins that modulate them. The goal of the proposed research will be a significant step towards understanding the properties of alcohol-binding sites at an atomic level. We believe this knowledge will be essential for future design and selection of drugs that could reduce craving or addiction induced by alcohol. Specifically, we will study the sites fo alcohol binding in ligand- gated ion channels (LGICs), which include GABAaRs and GlyRs. Our homology modeling and experimental methods will provide 3-dimensional visualization of GABAaRs to increase our understanding of alcohol's action. This innovative approach combines cutting-edge computational and neuroscience techniques with molecular biology. We expect our results will have a significant impact on the broader class of alcohol- binding sites in other important receptors of the nervous system. Our Approach focuses on three aspects of alcohol-binding sites via three Specific Aims: Where are alcohol-binding sites; intra-subunit versus inter- subunit in LGICs (Aim 1), which specific residues or segments in LGICs mediate the effect of alcohol binding at these sites (Aims 1 and 2), and how do these sites modulate ligand binding (Aims 2 and 3).  In Aim 1, Trudell and Bertaccini will build computational models of alcohol-binding sites in GABA receptors and design site-directed mutations to test the models. Harris and Howard, under a subcontract to the University of Texas, Austin, will test the function of these mutated receptors. We will iteratively refine the models the Trudell group will use the models to predict the effects of mutations; the Harris group will test if the models are consistent with experimental data; and the Trudell group will then modify the models to fit the new data. They will address this controversial question: What is the most important alcohol effect site in GABAaR? Is it Intra-subunit or Inter-subunit? They will also test the hypothesis that the GABAaR TM3 helix must rotate during activation in order to incorporate all recent experimental data. In Aim 2, the Trudell and Harris laboratories will recreate the alcohol-binding site from GABAaRs in the homologous but natively EtOH insensitive ion channel, GLIC, by determining which residues are specific to EtOH binding in GABAR and mutating these into their corresponding homologous positions within GLIC. In Aim 3, Trudell and Bertaccini will use three docking programs to investigate binding of alcohol analogs. Our investigators have proven accomplishment in alcohol research and possess the resources necessary to accomplish our Aims. Our proposal is responsive to both the NIAAA initiative in computational neuroscience and the NIH Roadmap: Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. These significant studies will provide essential knowledge needed to design alcohol-binding antagonists which could revolutionize treatment for alcohol abuse and dependence."
"9446531","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Nearly 6 million American women and girls have physical disabilities. Characterized by impaired mobility, physical disability creates many social, psychological and health challenges. Gynecological and reproductive (G-R) health is essential to the overall health of all women. Nevertheless, many women with physical disabilities must endure environmental barriers and ill-informed systems of care to receive the G-R health care they need. Unfortunately, many must also endure significant marginalization when seeking and receiving care; as a result, some choose to forgo G-R care altogether. Despite the potentially dire consequences of poorly managed G-R health in this vulnerable and underserved population, very little is known about its impact on health-related quality of life. This paucity o information is due, in part, to the lack of relevant, sensitive, and specific measurement tools. Thus there is a critical need to create measurement tools that are relevant and important to women with physical disabilities. The proposed work will advance the field by addressing the gynecological and reproductive health of women with physical disabilities in the pursuit of three specific aims: 1) build clinically relevant item pools of health-related quality of life items in gynecological and reproductive health to enhance clinical care and research practice in an underserved population of women; 2) calibrate new item pools and create computer adaptive tests and short forms; and 3) psychometrically validate and demonstrate feasibility of the new measure in clinical settings. Meaningful and clinically relevant items will be generated through focus groups with women with physical disabilities and clinicians, literature review, expert review and cognitive testing. New items will be field tested in a large, diverse sample of women with physical disabilities and calibrated using Item Response Theory to develop computer adapted tests and short forms. Psychometric validity and reliability will be evaluated. Feasibility and clinical utility will be assessed by women with physical disabilities and their clinicians. The contribution of this project to the field is to develop a clinically relevant tool that will allow clinicians and researchers to validly and reliably measure gynecological and reproductive health related quality of life in women with physical disabilities. This contribution is significant becaue it is the first step in a continuum of research that is expected to lead to the development of evidence- based knowledge to guide clinical practice and improve the health and well-being of this vulnerable population. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it represents a new and substantive departure from the status quo by utilizing computer adaptive testing for efficiency and by providing clinicians with immediately identified problems and actionable solutions. Ultimately, this new measure can change clinical practice, inform policy, and significantly improve the health and lives of women with physical disabilities."
"9407532","HIV entry into the CNS occurs early after peripheral infection and is mediated by the transmigration of infected monocytes across the BBB, establishing CNS viral reservoirs, neuronal damage, and low level inflammation, despite antiretroviral therapy (ART), that mediate HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, HAND, in >50% of infected people even in those with undetectable virus. The mechanisms of HIV infected monocyte transmigration across the BBB have only been minimally characterized. A mature CD14+CD16+ monocyte subset is key to HIV CNS pathogenesis. We showed that these cells selectively transmigrate across our model of the human BBB in response to the chemokine CCL2, and that when HIV infected, they transmigrate in even greater numbers. This is due, in part, to their increased junctional proteins JAM-A and ALCAM, and increased CCR2, the receptor for CCL2. CD14+CD16+ monocytes in HIV-infected individuals are heterogeneous, consisting of cells that are infected with HIV (HIV+), and cells exposed to viral and host factors, but not infected with the virus (HIVexp). It is not known whether the transmigration of HIV+ and HIVexp CD14+CD16+ monocytes across the BBB differs, and how this affects CNS neuropathogenesis. HIV+ monocytes that cross the BBB may differentiate into long-lived CNS macrophages and establish and maintain CNS viral reservoirs contributing to CNS damage. With ART, productively infected CD14+CD16+ monocytes in the peripheral blood are significantly reduced, with a small number of these cells still having detectable viral DNA. We propose that the neuronal damage and chronic inflammation that mediate cognitive impairment, even in the presence of ART, is dependent on continued reseeding of the brain with HIV+CD14+CD16+ monocytes, maintaining CNS viral reservoirs and continuing the influx of these infected as well as uninfected monocytes into the brain. Mechanisms that ensure that these HIV+CD14+CD16+ monocytes replenish CNS viral reservoirs over extended periods are not known. We hypothesize that CCR2, and junctional proteins are higher on HIV+ monocytes compared to HIVexp monocytes, resulting in their preferential transmigration across the BBB, and that this is associated with the establishment and maintenance of CNS viral reservoirs, and with neuronal and structural damage, low level inflammation, and cognitive impairment. We will characterize HIV+ and HIVexp monocytes using primary human mature CD14+CD16+ monocytes infected in vitro. We will also characterize the phenotype and transmigration of HIV+ and HIVexp mature monocytes from a longitudinal cohort of HIV-infected people stably suppressed on ART, and determine whether these circulating monocyte characteristics correlate with cognitive impairment and neurobiologic abnormalities using neuroimaging. We will determine whether CCR2, JAM-A, or ALCAM are biomarkers of HAND. We will use blocking antibodies and cenicriviroc in transmigration assays to assess JAMA, ALCAM, and CCR2 as potential therapeutic targets to limit CNS entry of peripheral blood HIV+ monocytes and potentially reduce reservoirs and HAND."
"9331677","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The understanding and treatment of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of blindness in the developed world, is undergoing a revolution. Intraocular injections of medications that can arrest the rapidly destructive wet form of the disease have changed this form to a chronic, manageable illness. Now we are facing the challenge of the dry, or atrophic, form of AMD that proceeds more slowly but whose progression to the advanced form of geographic atrophy (GA) is at best impeded, but not stopped, by current therapies of oral antioxidants. The broad goal of this research is a better and unified understanding of the biochemical and structural components of dry AMD, in the living eye and validated in the laboratory, that in turn will lead to the root causs and treatment. Theories of the pathogenesis of dry AMD and GA abound, but none are certain. One thread common to many involves the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), an important layer of cells just under the retina that are critical to its nutrition, oxygen supply, and visual functins. Hence, it is logical that RPE health may play a role in AMD. Fortunately, there is a non-invasive imaging technique with which to study the RPE called autofluorescence (AF), which is gaining in use in clinical and research settings. The basic principle is that the RPE contains a substance called lipofuscin which fluoresces under blue light to produce an orange glow that can be detected and mapped. Very recently, the imaging instrument has been modified for research by inserting a fluorescent reference chip that allows the AF signal to be quantified (qAF imaging), thereby providing a biochemical assay of the amounts and distribution of lipofuscin. Hence, these quantities and patterns can be directly compared, between normal subjects and patients with AMD, and across time. In particular, these images are excellent pictures of the RPE in the early stages of dry AMD and as these stages progress to GA. Another rapidly advancing technology is called spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD- OCT). It provides high-resolution structural images of the living retina, RPE, and underlying choroid. The specific aims of this proposal consist of harnessing together the biochemistry of qAF and the structural precision of SD-OCT to understand the interaction of the RPE and retina as AMD progresses over time. Gifted collaborators in the pathology lab will guide study efforts with parallel studiesof donor eyes with the same stages of AMD, by identifying the exact anatomical structures seen in images of living patients. Success in this venture will bring much-needed relief to suffering patients and relief to the healthcare burden of an aging population."
"9527301","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dendritic and axonal morphologies play fundamental roles in physiological brain function and pathological dysfunction by affecting synaptic integration, spike train transmission, and circuit connectivity. Incorporating existing and forthcoming experimental data into accurate, full-scale, and biologically plausible neural network simulations is important for quantitatively bridging the sub-cellular and systems-levels. We successfully designed, implemented, and freely distributed to the community computer software and databases to reconstruct, analyze, visualize, simulate, and share the 3D tree-like shape of neurons from many labeling and visualization techniques, developmental stages, and experimental conditions. We imaged by light microscopy, digitally traced, and shared new data, and we provided our peers with the electronic means of freely doing the same. Moreover, we combined those data with computational models of membrane biophysics to investigate the neuronal structure-activity relationship. We propose to expand this research approach with two specific aims. The first is to augment the power, scope, and usability of the NeuroMorpho.Org repository of digital tracings. We plan to triple the number of shared reconstructions, adding new species, brain regions, and neuron types. Moreover, we will enhance the search functionality with a semantic engine using state-of-the-art ontologies. We will also extend the domain and format of distributed data to include circuitry, multi-channel information, and temporal sequences. The second aim is to develop a new knowledge base of neuron types in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex by quantifying their morphological, physiological, and molecular properties from published reports. The hippocampal formation is one of the most studied brain regions, underlies autobiographic memory storage and spatial representation, and is prominently involved in devastating neurological disease, including epilepsy and Alzheimer's. Yet, our conceptual understanding of how the hippocampus works is limited compared to the wealth of available knowledge about its neurons, because it is difficult to find and integrate all relevant data scattered in thousands of papers. We will identify all published information and annotate it with specific pointers to the source documents in the peer- reviewed literature. The resulting open-source portal (Hippocampome.Org) will enable the derivation of potential circuit connectivity and the predictive simulation of network-wide spiking activity. We will make this application especially relevant to neuropathology by linking specific neuron types to diseases involving the hippocampus, and demonstrate its potential with a new model of learning disabilities based on impaired structural plasticity."
"9409142","Project Summary The HIV-1 RNA genome contains cis-acting RNA sequences elements that control many aspects of viral replication. In addition, there are remarkable global compositional features of the HIV-1 RNA genome that are heretofore unexplained. An essential feature of the HIV-1 RNA genome that enables its encapsidation is its ability to bind to the nucleocapsid (NC) domain in Gag. While a specific interaction between the packaging sequence at the 5' end of the viral genome and Gag is well known to be important for initiating HIV-1 genome packaging it is also well known that the packaging sequence is not absolutely required, nor is it sufficient for highly selective packaging of HIV-1 RNA. In Aim 1 we will determine whether nucleotide composition and sequence motifs throughout the HIV-1 genome constitute a multipartite packaging signal, and whether this feature, coupled with the changing RNA binding specificity of Gag/NC can account for the remarkably specific packaging of HIV-1 genomes into virions. The Matrix (MA) domain of Gag also binds to RNA, as well as to membranes, via a highly basic surface. However, in the case of MA, ~10 host tRNAs are bound with exceptional specificity in the cytoplasm of infected cells. These findings lead to the hypothesis, to be explored in the ensuing funding cycle, that tRNA regulates HIV-1 assembly dynamics or location. Aim 2 is centered on our recent discovery of an RNA binding protein that causes turnover of RNA molecules based on their nucleotide composition. The unusual composition of the HIV-1 genome appears, in part, to represent an evasion strategy to avoid detection by this this protein. We will determine the molecular mechanisms by which this apparent host defense mechanism functions."
"9302429","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the United States. Each year more than 795,000 people in the U.S. have a stroke; over 100,000 will die and a majority of the others will suffer varying degrees of neurological injury. An NIH estimate indicated that the cost of caring for people with strokes exceeded $73 billion in U.S. healthcare dollars each year. While many advances have been made in the care of people with strokes (e.g. preventative measures and rehabilitation), once a stroke has occurred, the ability to effectively prevent or limit neurological injury remains elusive. Only a small fraction of people having an acute stroke are suitable candidates for endovascular therapy; estimates place this number between 58,000 and 120,000 per year. Critical factors which impact both the likelihood of successful revascularization and, more importantly, the chances of a good clinical outcome are: 1) the time from onset of a stroke to revascularization and 2) the ability to distinguish patients who have a small volume of irreversibly injured brain (ischemic core) and a large volume of ischemic but salvageable brain (penumbra) from ones where there is a large ischemic core and very little or no penumbra. It is on these two factors that we believe the application of the proposed techniques will have a quantum impact. Our overarching objective is to develop a new imaging workflow using available C-arm cone-beam CT data acquisition systems that are currently widely available in angiography suites worldwide. We believe that this new clinical paradigm will enable selected patients with an acute ischemic stroke (AIS) to be diagnosed, triaged, and treated using a single modality, thus greatly reducing delay in the time from stroke onset to treatment. The proposed imaging scheme provides imaging data that will enhance the ability to select those patients most likely to benefit from revascularization and eliminate ones for whom revascularization may be futile or potentially harmful. This new workflow is enabled by a revolutionary image reconstruction technique, namely the Synchronized Multi-Artifact Reduction with Tomographic RECONstruction (SMART-RECON) technique, invented by the PI of the project. This new reconstruction method fundamentally challenges the traditional conditions for image reconstruction written in textbooks and other recent literature: Its application enables the reconstruction of time-resolved CT images using data acquired from a series of angular segments taken over an angular span of about 60 degrees rather than the conventional standard of 180 degrees plus the fan angle. This new technique enables a quantum leap in C-arm based cone beam CT imaging, allowing one to acquire and reconstruct high temporal resolution images at ultra low radiation dose levels. These SMART- RECON processed images may then be used to generate non-contrast CT images to exclude the presence of hemorrhage, time-resolved cone beam CT angiography to evaluate the site of occlusion and collaterals, and CT perfusion parametric images to assess the extent of ischemic core and penumbra, thereby fulfilling the imaging requirements for one-stop-shop imaging in an angiography suite. Adding further value is the ability to obtain these images with such low levels of radiation exposure that multiple assessments during an intervention become feasible. Therefore, in this proposal, the theme is to use this innovation in technology to take a quantum leap forward in clinical practice. To fully optimize and validate the proposed imaging workflow for acute ischemic stroke diagnosis and treatment, three aims are planned using both an animal model and human subject studies. The purpose of Aim #1 is to develop and optimize the SMART-RECON technique to enable One-Stop-Shop imaging; Aim #2 is to validate One-Stop-Shop workflow in animal studies; and Aim #3 is to validate One-Stop-Shop imaging in a two-phase human subject studies. Upon the completion of the proposed aims and the associated quantifiable milestones, a new neurovascular imaging platform should have been developed and tested in clinical environment. It will provide image guidance for diagnosis, patient selection, treatment planning, treatment delivery, and treatment efficacy assessment in patients presenting with an AIS. It is impossible to overstate the degree to which Time is Brain in patients with an AIS. Thus, a workflow which can save time compared to current techniques enabled by the proposed revolutionary imaging technology should allow for a quantum leap in diagnosis and treatment for patients suffering from an acute ischemic stroke."
"9302625","Despite the high cost and widespread prevalence of alcohol use disorders, treatment options are limited.  Thus, there is considerable interest in developing new therapeutic agents to treat alcohol use disorders.  New evidence suggests that atypical PKM? regulates addiction-related behavior, but nothing is known about  PKM? regulation of ethanol intake. PKM? is an important downstream effecter of mTORC1, a protein  signaling complex that regulates ethanol consumption and has become a central focus of the ACTG. PKM?  is encoded by the Prkcz gene and is critical for memory maintenance. Brain Prkcz expression is greater in  inbred and selected lines of mice that drink high amounts of ethanol, and in the striatum of C57BL/6 mice  after a single bout of ethanol intake. Thus, ethanol-related increases in PKM? may promote excessive  drinking, suggesting PKM? inhibition could be a unique strategy to reduce ethanol consumption. PKM? may  promote drug self-administration through actions in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) since NAc PKM? is  required conditioned reward for cocaine and morphine The central hypothesis of our proposal is that ethanol  activates PKM? signaling in the NAc, and that this activation promotes ethanol consumption. Specific Aim 1  uses multiple complementary techniques (conditional knockout of PKM?, a dominant-negative PKM? mutant  and a PKC? inhibitor peptide) to assess whether NAc PKM? promotes binge ethanol consumption,  reinstatement, and relapse to drinking. Specific Aim 2 investigates whether ethanol intake activates NAc  PKM? through mTORC1 signaling (in collaboration with Research Component 4). Specific Aim 3 examines  whether PKM? promotes binge ethanol intake through GluA2-containing AMPA receptors, based on previous  work indicating that PKM? increases GluA2 subunits at glutamatergic synapses. Specific Aim 4 uses a new,  chemical genetics approach to identify PKM? substrates that may regulate ethanol intake and AMPA  receptor function. By understanding the interaction between ethanol intake and PKM?, we hope to achieve  our long-term goal of identifying novel signaling pathways that are targets for future development of drugs to  treat alcohol use disorders."
"9307141","Project Summary/Abstract Acute kidney injury (AKI) confers high morbidity and mortality. Even though patients survive, there is a substantial risk of progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Unfortunately, there is no effective therapy to retard this progression. ?Klotho (here referred as Klotho) was shown to effectively block this transition. But, whether Klotho?s renoprotection involves prevention of vascular rarefaction and whether the suppressive effect of Klotho on renal fibrosis is associated with the clearance of collagen are largely unknown. Abnormal autophagy may lead to renal tubular and vascular damage, and renal fibrosis. Vascular rarefaction and renal fibrosis contribute to CKD. Klotho deficiency is associated with impaired angiogenesis. But, it is unclear whether Klotho can rescue peritubular capillaries in AKI. Klotho was found to upregulate autophagy, improve revascularization, and promote collagen I degradation in vitro; but, how Klotho affects autophagy and if this effect modulates vascular rarefaction and fibrosis, and prevents progression to CKD needs to be defined. The central hypothesis is that Klotho prevents AKI transition to CKD by promoting autophagy, which in turn inhibits renal fibrosis and ameliorates vascular rarefaction. There are three specific aims to test this hypothesis. Aim 1 investigates if Klotho increases autophagy flux in the kidney by (1) examining if Klotho upregulates renal autophagy flux in LC3 reporter mice; (2) defining the mechanisms of upregulation of autophagy by Klotho in vivo; (3) exploring how Klotho regulates autophagy flux in kidney cell line. Aim 2 examines if Klotho inhibits renal fibrosis via upregulation of autophagy activity by (1) examining if Klotho upregulates autophagy and inhibits renal fibrosis post-IRI; (2) defining if autophagy levels influence renal fibrosis post-AKI using mice with low or high autophagy activity; (3) investigating how autophagy reduces collagen I or promotes the degradation of collagen I in GFP-collagen I transfected cells in vitro. Aim 3 explores if Klotho ameliorates vascular rarefaction via upregulation of autophagy in endothelial cells post-AKI by (1) examining if Klotho restores peritubular capillaries with structural analysis (histology and high resolution ?CT), and measurement of renal blood perfusion and oxygenation (functional MRI, fMRI); (2) testing if Klotho blocks endothelial-mesenchymal transition in AKI mice with endothelial tracing markers; (3) confirming if Klotho protects endothelial damage and endothelial-mesenchymal transition in cultured endothelial cells via modulation of autophagy. Aim 1 focuses on basic biology of Klotho effect on autophagy, which builds the basis for other two independent but scientifically interconnected Aims. This renewed proposal was built based on previous 5-year studies and will provide more evidence to support the concept that Klotho upregulates autophagy to inhibit fibrosis, ameliorates rarefaction after AKI and retards AKI-to-CKD progression. Developing new approaches to enhance renal vascular recovery and inhibit fibrosis is the translational objective of the proposal. Bringing Klotho to a therapeutic platform in human AKI is in the proximal future."
"9257894","Project Summary / Abstract Manifestations of risk-taking behavior in adolescents, such as teen pregnancy and underage drinking, represent major public health problems with substantial economic and social costs. Adolescent risk-taking is multifactorial, and strongly influenced by sociodemographics, gender, peer behavior, and community factors, including neighborhood crime. In addition, evidence suggests that early life exposure to neurotoxicants that impede development of the prefrontal cortex such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), lead (Pb) and methylmercury (MeHg) may contribute to risk-taking and its neuropsychological correlates. Identifying preventable environmental risk factors that contribute to increased risk-taking behavior is a public health priority, especially among communities exposed to multiple chemical and non-chemical stressors, as is often the case near Superfund sites. The main goals of the proposed research are: (1) to investigate the relation of prenatal exposure to chemical and non-chemical stressors with adolescents' risk-taking and related behaviors, and (2) to combine results from these epidemiologic analyses with contemporary exposure models to build health risk models for the community living near the New Bedford Harbor (NBH) Superfund Site. We will focus our work on prenatal exposure to mixtures of prevalent organochlorines (PCBs, DDE) and neurotoxic metals (Pb, MeHg, manganese, and arsenic), and consider how risks are modified by non-chemical stressors and sociodemographic factors. We will leverage extensive exposure and behavioral measures available from a well-characterized longitudinal birth cohort study ( the New Bedford Cohort or NBC of children born 1993-1998, with 528 followed through adolescence). We will also conduct analyses within a much larger longitudinal population-based dataset of relevant outcomes and sociodemographic risk factors available from the Massachusetts Pregnancy to Early Life Longitudinal (PELL) data system, with over 12,000 New Bedford area births (including all NBC participants) during the same time period. We propose complementary epidemiologic analyses using the NBC and PELL data to characterize the relation of early life chemical and non-chemical exposures with risk-taking behaviors among New Bedford area adolescents born in the 1990s. These analyses will employ state-of-the-art methods for assessing the effects of complex exposure mixtures. The proposed epidemiologic analyses are highly innovative in their capacity to characterize a comprehensive continuum of risk-taking-related outcomes (from psychometric test measures to hospitalizations for clinical disorders). We will combine our epidemiologic models with current measures of multiple metal exposures and novel statistical approaches to characterizing contemporary exposures to multiple chemical and non-chemical stressors, to build robust community health risk models to predict risk-taking behavior and related outcomes for New Bedford. Our health risk estimates will provide insight to the community and other stakeholders about the benefits of interventions that could improve conditions in New Bedford, and thereby decrease future health risk."

"9480205","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The unicellular parasite Trichomonas vaginalis is responsible for the most prevalent, non-viral, sexually-transmitted infection worldwide, with approximately 1/4 billion people contracting trichomoniasis annually. Trichomoniasis is the most common parasitic infection in the US and has an annual incidence estimated at 5 million cases. The frequency of infection and an increase in the number of drug resistant clinical isolates of T. vaginalis underscore the need to develop new chemotherapeutic strategies and drugs that eliminate the parasite. Resistance to the only drugs licensed for therapy, the 5-nitroimidazole (5NI) drugs metronidazole (Mz) and tinidazole (Tz), occurs in approximately 5% of cases of trichomoniasis. 5NIs are prodrugs that are activated by selective reduction inside anaerobic microbes, a step that is critical for killing, but also responsible for resistance when the microbe loses its capacity to reduce 5NIs. Upon activation, 5NIs kill the cell by forming covalent, inactivating adducts with essential target molecules, which are poorly defined. The long-term goal of the research proposed here is to define microbial targets of 5NI drugs that are essential for the survival of T. vaginalis and leverage this information to develop inhibitors of protein targets that are effective in the treatment of drug resistant trichomoniasis. The proposed studies have five Specific Aims. The first two aims will be achieved during the R21 phase and the latter three during the R33 phase. In Aim 1, we will identify nitro drug targets in model T. vaginalis strains using a strategy that employs click chemistry and mass spectrometry. In Aim 2, we will determine which protein targets are essential for T. vaginalis viability using reverse genetics to test whether elimination of the gene is lethal. After transitioning to the R33 phase, in Aim 3 we will identify nitro drug targets that are common to a broad range of geographically and genetically diverse T. vaginalis clinical isolates. In Aim 4, we will determine whether selected, common targets identified in Aim 3 are required for parasite viability. In Aim 5 we will develop inhibitors for the most promising nitro drug targets and examine inhibitor activity in vitro and in vivo. In the end, we aim to have validated novel drug targets and developed new inhibitors against these targets as candidates for effective treatment of Mz resistant trichomoniasis. The proposed research will also pave the way for using the same approach to identify and validate new antimicrobials to treat other anaerobic parasitic infections, such as giardiasis and amoebiasis, for which Mz is the primary drug used for therapy."
"9257896","Project Summary / Abstract The goal of the basic research proposed here is to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying critical adaptive changes occurring in natural populations of fish after long-term, multi-generational exposure to mixtures of contaminants at Superfund sites. The research applies innovative molecular approaches in an ecological context to understand chemical-induced evolutionary changes in signaling pathways implicated in the response to Superfund chemicals. The studies focus on the Atlantic killifish Fundulus heteroclitus, a unique model system for integrated investigation of ecological and mechanistic questions concerning the impact of chemicals at Superfund sites. At several locations along the Atlantic coast, including the New Bedford Harbor (NBH), MA Superfund site, populations of killifish have evolved resistance to the highly toxic, dioxin-like (non-ortho-substituted) polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and other chemicals that act through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). Our recent studies show that NBH killifish also appear to have reduced sensitivity to non-dioxin-like (ortho-substituted) PCBs?the most abundant components of PCB mixtures?but the mechanisms involved are not known. While allelic variation at killifish AHR loci has been associated with resistance to dioxin-like PCBs, recent studies have implicated another AHR pathway member, AHR- interacting protein (AIP; also known as Ara9 or XAP2) as the strongest candidate for a resistance gene in killifish populations exhibiting reduced sensitivity to dioxin-like compounds. The central hypothesis is that the evolution of resistance to dioxin-like PCBs involves additive or epistatic interactions between multiple components of the AHR pathway, including AIP and one or more of the four killifish AHRs. To test this hypothesis, in Aim 1 we propose to use CRISPR-Cas9 genome-editing technology to generate null and hypomorphic alleles of AIP in killifish and zebrafish and to use them to test hypotheses about the role of AIP in the mechanism of resistance to dioxin-like compounds. In Aim 2, we will identify AIP single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the resistant phenotype in PCB-resistant killifish, and use CRISPR- Cas9-mediated, single-nucleotide genome editing of zebrafish AIP to study the role of these AIP SNPs in the mechanism of PCB-resistance. Aim 3 will elucidate the mechanism of resistance to ortho-PCBs and, in particular, whether it is a) secondary to defects in AIP or AHR or b) an independently-evolved phenotype. We will also investigate possible mechanisms of o-PCB toxicity involving altered signaling through nuclear receptors such as PXR and PPAR that interact with AIP or exhibit cross-talk with AHR. The proposed research represents a unique opportunity to establish a novel mechanism of population-level effects of pollutants and will advance our understanding of the long-term impact of chemical mixtures on ecological systems."

"9383142","Cardiovascular diseases, which include coronary artery disease and stroke, are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Elevated levels of LDL cholesterol are a major risk factor for coronary artery disease, and more than 30% of American adults and 7% of adolescents have high LDL cholesterol levels. There is a log-linear relationship between blood cholesterol level and mortality due to coronary artery disease, which indicates the benefit of cholesterol reduction regardless of the starting level. The liver plays a dominant role in cholesterol metabolism, so many pharmacological approaches to lower cholesterol target the liver. The ?statins? have proven effective at reducing cholesterol levels and mortality due to coronary artery disease, and they are therefore among the most widely used drugs in the United States. However, statins also produce adverse effects and undergo drug-drug interactions. Our goal is to understand the spectrum of mechanisms by which statins and other drugs that interfere with cholesterol metabolism regulate hepatic processes. This project focuses on a non-therapeutic consequence of cholesterol synthesis inhibition that involves an interaction with the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), a xenobiotic-sensing regulator of drug, glucose, and lipid metabolism. This interaction does not occur in rodent hepatocytes, emphasizing the need to study the process in human hepatic systems. The hypothesis of this project is that inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis suppresses CAR activation and target gene expression in human hepatocytes and that this effect is mediated through an inhibitory interaction between CAR and sterol regulatory element binding factor 2 (SREBP2). The specific aims are to (1) define the impact of cholesterol synthesis inhibition on CAR target gene expression in human hepatocytes in vitro and in vivo and (2) define the mechanism by which cholesterol synthesis inhibition regulates CAR target gene expression in human hepatic cells. To investigate the impact of cholesterol synthesis inhibition on CAR-regulated gene expression in a manner that is directly relevant to humans, the study emphasizes the use of human hepatocytes, both in primary culture and in a mouse model. The mechanistic studies consider the complexity of different human CAR isoforms; evaluate the impact of cholesterol synthesis inhibition on CAR expression, activation, and recruitment to the promoters of target genes; and feature determining how an interaction between CAR and SREBP2 could underlie the impact of cholesterol synthesis inhibition on CAR activity. The findings of this study will provide new insight into the fundamental mechanisms by which drugs that inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis can affect human hepatocellular physiology in a manner that alters xenobiotic-sensing receptor-sensitive processes. Because these effects emanate from inhibition of the drug's intended target, they are not easily dissociated from the drug's therapeutic effects. Such effects are potentially relevant to understanding inter- individual differences in metabolism as well as the origin of adverse drug effects."

"9354254","PROJECT SUMMARY - PROJECT 1 The mission of our Perimenopause in Brain Aging and Alzheimer's Disease Program Project (P3) is to discover biological transformations in brain that occur during the perimenopausal transition that lead to endophenotypes predictive of risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our goals are to identify the mechanisms by which these transformations occur and to translate these discoveries into strategies to prevent conversion to an at-AD-risk phenotype. The mission of Project 1 is to provide a mechanistic rationale for the adverse impact of the APOE4 gene in females. Utilizing rodent models of human perimenopause carrying humanized ApoE4, this mission will be accomplished through systems biology analyses of bioenergetic, redox, and inflammatory pathways activated during the perimenopausal transition and their impact for developing an at-AD-risk phenotype through three specific aims: (1) determining the ApoE4- perimenopausal bioenergetic phenotypes most at risk for developing biomarkers of AD; (2) delineating the mechanistic pathways involved in the metabolic-inflammatory axis relevant to development of an at-AD-risk phenotype; and (3) assessing the impact of ovarian hormones on the expression of bioenergetic and inflammatory biomarkers of AD. To address our hypotheses, we will determine bioenergetic gene expression across the perimenopausal transition in the humanized ApoE4 rodents and monitor indicators of mitochondrial function: bioinformatics network analyses of gene expression, in vivo cerebral glucose metabolism, and synaptic transmission. Mechanistic analyses will establish the cross-talk between energy metabolism and inflammatory responses in the perimenopause of ApoE4 rats through the coordinated expression of three modules: (1) Metabolism; (2) Redox Control; and (3) Neuroinflammation. Project 1 collaborates with Projects 2 and 3 to test the hypothesis that decline in brain bioenergetics leads to activation of the inflammatory response in brain that exacerbates mitochondrial function and leads to development of AD pathology (Project 2) and to a bioenergetic phenotype (assessed by neuroimaging) and cognitive decline in perimenopausal and post-menopausal women (Project 3). Outcomes of Project 1 include: (1) basic science discovery of the bioenergetics of the perimenopausal aging transition in ApoE4 carriers vulnerable to development of AD; (2) mechanistic pathways that connect bioenergetics decline to neuroinflammation by redox-controlled pathways in the perimenopausal brain; (3) translational discovery of the window of opportunity for ovarian hormone intervention to prevent impairment of the bioenergetics- inflammatory axis in the ApoE4-positive perimenopausal brain; and (4) clinical associations of glucose metabolism, inflammatory markers and cognitive decline in postmenopausal women."
"8134153","Project Summary: We have utilized an established model of behavioral stress in Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) rats  that indicates reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediate the stress-induced increase in blood pressure. We  have hypothesized that stress triggers ROS production via mechanisms involving the endothelin (ET) and/or  angiotensin II pathways through activation of NADPH oxidase and uncoupled NOS. Project 2's BPStress  Cohort of young adults has shown that the response to stress was significantly greater in obese individuals  or ones at a lower socioeconomic status that carry a specific ET polymorphism. Data in DS rats indicates  that a high fat diet augments the stress-induced blood pressure response when compared to DS rats on a  normal fat diet. Given the epidemic of childhood obesity that has contributed to the risk of hypertension, it is  important to determine the mechanisms responsible for the augmented stress response. Lower childhood  socioeconomic status is recognized to be associated with increased cardiovascular disease morbidity and  mortality. We initiated preliminary studies with an established model of early life stress in rats. Pups are  separated from their mothers for 3 hr/day from day 2-14 of life. The early life stress (separated) rats display a  greater response to stress when compared to the non-separated rats. Rats with an impaired ET signaling  pathway that are exposed to early life stress do not have an augmented response to stress in adulthood.  These data have led us to predict that early life stress activates a component of the ET pathway that  potentiates the stress response. We propose the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1: To test the  hypothesis that air jet stress activates the ET and/or Ang II pathways, which stimulates NADPH oxidase  and/or uncoupled NOS as the enzymatic source of ROS, increasing blood pressure; Specific Aim 2: To test  the hypothesis that high fat diet augments the air jet stress induced increase in blood pressure via production  of ROS; Specific Aim 3: To test the hypothesis that early life stress potentiates the air jet stress induced  increase in blood pressure via the ET pathway. Relevance: The chronic stressors (high fat diet and early life  stress) are models of established stressors that are known to sensitize humans to stress and increase the  risk for hypertension. A complete understanding of the mechanisms involved in the blood pressure response  to stress may disclose approaches for minimizing the risk of hypertension."
"9218304","Project Summary It is known that social determinants influence children?s health trajectories, particularly for low-income children. Pediatric primary care provides a unique opportunity to address children?s social conditions; however, recent national data demonstrates that few providers routinely screen for unmet needs at visits. Our prior work has focused on developing a pediatric primary care-based intervention, ?WE CARE,? aimed at addressing poor families? material needs ? food security, employment, parental education, housing stability, household heat, and childcare ? by systematically screening for these needs and referring families to existing community-based services. To date, we have tested WE CARE primarily in community health centers (CHCs); our RCT demonstrated WE CARE?s efficacy on parental receipt of community-based resources. Although demonstrating WE CARE?s impact in this setting is important, over 80% of low-income children receive care from providers in traditional pediatric practices (i.e. non-CHCs). Given the Affordable Care Act?s mandate for high-value, patient- centered primary care and pediatric professional guidelines, along with WE CARE?s efficacy data, we believe we are well-positioned to test and implement WE CARE in traditional pediatric practices. We propose a large- scale, Hybrid Type 2 effectiveness-implementation trial in twenty eight pediatric practices in the US. A stepped wedge study cluster RCT design will be used to implement WE CARE in all practices using two common strategies used to integrate systems-based interventions into primary care ? our previously facilitated ?on-site? strategy in which content experts provide training sessions and on-going consultation; and a self-directed ?web-based? method modeled after the American Academy of Pediatrics? practice transformation strategy. The proposed study?s specific aims are to: 1) demonstrate the non-inferiority of the self-directed, web-based strategy for implementing WE CARE, in comparison to the facilitated on-site strategy; 2) demonstrate WE CARE?s effectiveness on increasing parental receipt of community resources; and 3) assess the sustainability of WE CARE in pediatric practices. We hypothesize that WE CARE will have equivalent fidelity via the two strategies. Based on our prior work, we hypothesize that WE CARE will significantly increase parental receipt of community resources six months post-visit compared to usual care. We also expect WE CARE to be sustained 1-, 2-, and 3-years post-implementation. We expect to gather data from over 9,000 chart reviews, 2,800 parent-child dyads, and 150 providers and office staff. Our proposal is innovative because it challenges current pediatric practice for addressing social determinants at visits. This proposal has significant public health implications for the delivery of primary care to low-income children and is aligned with the mission of the NICHD. Our long-term goal is to disseminate an evidence-based intervention that systematically addresses the social determinants of health to pediatric practices that provide care to low-income children throughout the US."
"9316330","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cocaine use disorder is a sizeable health challenge in the United States for which there are no approved medications for treatment. Vulnerability to environmental and drug-related cues previously associated with cocaine-taking behavior (?cue reactivity?) is thought to trigger cycles of dependence and relapse that contribute to high recidivism rates in cocaine use disorder. Thus an improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying cue reactivity is necessary to generate new pharmacotherapeutic strategies to prevent relapse in cocaine use disorder. Studies indicate that the agranular insular cortex (AIC) may play a key role in regulating cue reactivity by serving as a point of convergence for the interpretation of interoceptive signals and relay of this information to other nodes within corticostriatal circuitry. The excitatory and inhibitory balance in the AIC microcircuitry, maintained by resident glutamate projection neurons and ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA) interneurons, respectively, is critical to its normal function. Alterations in the excitatory/inhibitory balance in the cortex are hypothesized to drive processes engaged in drug seeking behavior in addiction. Serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission through its cognate G?q/11 protein-coupled 5-HT2C receptor (5-HT2CR) is important in maintaining cortical excitatory/inhibitory balance and in regulating cue reactivity, and these receptors are expressed in the AIC. We propose that one potential mechanism to suppress cue reactivity is through the harmonization of the functional connectivity in the AIC-corticostriatal circuit, controlled by the 5-HT2CR system within the AIC. Employing pharmacogenetic, biochemical, behavioral, genetic, and pharmacological methodologies, the present study will address this hypothesis through two Specific Aims: 1) interrogate the AIC corticostriatial circuity in cocaine cue reactivity, and 2) elucidate 5-HT2CR control of AIC over cue reactivity. The elucidation of the complex regulation of the 5-HT2CR modulation of the GABA:glutamate neuronal interaction within the AIC as it relates to cue reactivity will lead to a better understanding of individual risk factors for relapse in cocaine use disorder. This information will be utilized to inform therapeutic development for prevention of relapse to ultimately address this barrier in the treatment of cocaine use disorder."

"8114904","In the airway of normal individuals and in response to injury, there is epithelial cell regeneration with  basal cell proliferation and subsequent differentiation to maintain the normal pseudostratified  epithelium. But as the clinical phenotype of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  progresses, the differentiation status of the airway epithelium begins to change as indicated by an  increased thickness of the epithelial layer, with proportionally more basal cells and less ciliated cells,  goblet cell hyperplasia, and eventually squamous metaplasia. In addition to the injury mediated by  cigarette smoke and inflammation, there is increasing evidence that the development of COPD is  associated with latent infection of the epithelium with adenoviruses. The focus of this project is on the  changes of gene expression in the airway epithelium that contribute to its altered differentiated state in  COPD. Our preliminary studies with gene expression microarrays combined with the developmental  biology literature have implicated the Notch signaling pathway as being critical to airway epithelial  differentiation. Notch is considered a primary gatekeeper against differentiation, with activation of the  Notch pathway blocking differentiation, whereas suppression of the pathway is associated with  allowing the cells to proceed toward a specific fate. Based on this background, the studies proposed in  this project are designed to test the hypothesis that COPD is associated with derangements of  the Notch signaling pathway in the airway epithelium, contributing to the abnormal pattern of  airway epithelial differentiation that characterizes this disorder. To test this hypothesis the  following specific aims are proposed. Specific aim 1. To evaluate the hypothesis that the Notch  signaling pathway is activated in the airway epithelium of individuals with COPD. Specific aim 2. To  examine the hypothesis that the airway epithelium cannot regenerate following injury in a normal  fashion in COPD, in part, because the normal pathways of the Notch signaling are disordered.  Specific aim 3. To test the hypothesis that group C adenovirus infection plays a role in the disordered  Notch signaling in the airway epithelium in COPD."

"9398516","ABSTRACT Neural tube defects (NTDs) are the second most common birth defect, affecting approximately 500,000 births worldwide based on estimates from the International Federation of Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus and over 3,000 pregnancies in the United States annually. Although the causes of NTDs in humans have been extensively studied, the known risk factors explain only a small proportion of the population burden and, thus provide only a partial solution towards their prevention. Additional effort to understand the causes, consequences and prevention of NTDs is of high clinical and public health significance, and therefore strongly warranted. Since its inception in 1999, the International Neural Tube Defects Conference series has provided a unique forum for the NTD research community to share research findings, identify research gaps and priorities and plan future research projects that address the causes, consequences and prevention of NTDs. The conferences have provided trainees with the opportunity to integrate into the larger NTD research community, present research findings and identify post-doctoral and faculty level positions within groups with shared research interests. As in the past, the goals of the 10th International Neural Tube Defects Conference are to:  1. bring together established and new investigators, from a variety of research disciplines, with a shared  interest in the causes, consequences and prevention of NTDs, 2. provide a forum for NTD researchers to present their latest research findings, 3. foster the development of multidisciplinary, multinational collaborations, 4. afford trainees an opportunity to learn about the opportunities in the field of NTD research and establish relationships with the scientists and clinicians who currently shape the NTD field."

At present, the most widely used selection criteria for bariatric surgery are based on strict BMI cutoffs, but there is increasing awareness that we need to improve our identification of who will benefit most from surgery, both in terms of health outcomes and economic costs. Our overall goal is to use large register-enriched Swedish patient cohorts to determine the health benefits, risks, and economic costs of bariatric surgery, and to use this information to improve prediction of treatment success. We will use register-enriched data from: (1) the SOS study cohort comprising 2010 surgically treated patients and 2037 matched controls; and (2) a newly established clinical cohort (SOReg/Itrim) of more than 60,000 patients who either underwent bariatric surgery or received low or very low calorie diets, and includes understudied populations (pregnant women, adolescents, the elderly, patients with BMI<35/<40). Virtually complete follow-up of risks, benefits and health economic outcomes until death or emigration is possible through Swedish nationwide and mandatory registers, allowing for unbiased analyses. Our cohorts also have the advantage of long follow-up (up to 27 years for SOS and 8 years for SOReg/Itrim), and include control groups who receive standard or intensive non-surgical obesity care. Our specific aims are: (1) to determine the health benefits of bariatric surgery over up to 27 years of follow-up (including overall and cause-specific mortality; heart diseases; and micro- /macrovascular disease risk in patients without diabetes at baseline); (2) to determine specific risks of bariatric surgery over up to 27 years of follow-up (including suicide, self-harm, and substance abuse; neonatal death in post-bariatric surgery pregnancies; and fractures); (3) to estimate the economic consequences of bariatric surgery (in subgroups divided by baseline glucose status and understudied populations); and (4) to identify predictors of treatment success for improved patient selection (in terms of both overall health effects and incremental cost- effectiveness). The results of our research will resolve uncertainties surrounding the long-term health benefits, risks, and economic outcomes of bariatric surgery. By analyzing data from specific patient subgroups and understudied populations, our results will provide unique information on the risk- benefit ratio and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for bariatric surgery overall and in certain patient segments. We anticipate that our results will contribute to improved patient selection and influence change of the outdated BMI-based eligibility criteria for bariatric surgery."
"9222645","PROJECT SUMMARY Mammals have evolved a number of innate immune defense mechanisms to detect microbial infection and protect the host. Previous studies of have demonstrated that intracellular multiprotein complexes, called inflammasomes, are important for host defense against infections. Inflammasomes sense infectious or noxious stimuli and activate effector proteases caspase-1 (casp-1) and caspase-11 (casp-11). Casp-1 processes pro- inflammatory cytokines IL-1band IL-18 to contribute to pathogen control. Casp-11 detects cytosolic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and activates a pro-inflammatory cell death pathway termed pyroptosis when host cells are infected with Gram-negative pathogens or during septic shock induced by LPS. An increased understanding of how casp-11 is regulated during Gram-negative bacterial infections is necessary in order to develop new therapeutics to treat these infections. We have used Salmonella enterica serovars, which cause diseases ranging from self-limited gastroenteritis (e.g., S. Typhimurium) to systemic infections (e.g., S. Typhi) in humans, as a model Gram-negative pathogen to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of inflammasome activation. We have shown that intracellular S. Typhimurium (Stm) induce casp-11-dependent macrophage death, which is due to leakage of LPS from the Salmonella containing vacuole (SCV) into the macrophage cytosol. In ongoing experiments, we have found that casp-11 is regulated by both host and pathogen factors. Our preliminary data show that: (1) mouse complement factors regulate casp-11 gene expression, (2) two different casp-11 transcript variants, in addition to the full-length transcript, occur in macrophages treated with LPS, and (3) at least one Stm virulence factor that is translocated into host cells by a type 3 secretion system (T3SS) dampens the activation of casp-11 inflammasomes. These data suggest that the innate immune detection of intracellular Gram-negative bacteria and LPS that leads to casp-11 activation is regulated by the host at multiple levels (e.g., gene transcription, multiple casp-11 variants) and by Stm virulence factors. Given these findings, we hypothesize that specific host proteins direct casp-11 cell death and that Salmonella virulence factors modulate casp-11 activation. These hypotheses will be addressed in the experiments of the following Specific Aims: (1) identify host molecules and pathways involved in casp-11-dependent cell death, (2) characterize the expression and function of casp-11 transcript variants in the context of bacterial infection, and (3) identify Salmonella factors that impact casp-11-dependent cell death. The result of this study will lead to the identification and characterization of new host and bacterial factors that regulate casp-11 during bacterial infections. These findings may lead to novel therapeutics for the treatment of infections with Gram-negative pathogens and sepsis."
"9508735","Project Summary: A mother and fetus exchange cells during human pregnancy, and these cells can durably persist as microchimerism, a small amount of foreign genetic material in another individual. Fetal microchimerism has been demonstrated by multiple investigators to be associated with later-life health for the mother, including both risk for and protection from disease. The complexity of these relationships may be further amplified when the fetal microchimerism is genetically abnormal. Trisomy 21, or Down Syndrome, is one of the most commonly seen fetal genetic abnormalities. Some disease risks known to be directly associated with Down Syndrome are reflected in the health of women with Down Syndrome offspring. For example, individuals with Down Syndrome are at high risk for the development of Alzheimer?s Disease. Interestingly, mothers of Down Syndrome offspring have been shown to have an increased incidence of Alzheimer?s Disease themselves. The cause of this association is unknown; however, one hypothesis is that genetically abnormal microchimeric cells could serve as a nidus for disease. On the other hand, microchimerism from a Trisomy 21 fetus may also have potential benefit, particularly related to risk of malignancy. Individuals with Down Syndrome have significantly lower than expected risks of solid tumors, especially breast cancer. In general, fetal microchimerism has been shown to be protective for the development of breast cancer; some hypothesize this relationship to reflect additional immune surveillance from the microchimeric ?graft? for elimination of precancerous cells. These observations raise the question whether microchimerism from a Trisomy 21 pregnancy may translate into additional protection when the mother acquires cells particularly protective for solid tumor development. To directly implicate genetically abnormal microchimerism as a contributing factor, its persistence after pregnancy and its functional capacity must be demonstrated. This proposal aims to identify fetal microchimerism in women who have had a pregnancy complicated by Trisomy 21 and to directly evaluate the genetic makeup and gene expression of microchimeric cells. If demonstrated, information from these studies could yield targets for therapy to maximize health in women with exposure to genetically abnormal microchimerism, as well as for more broadly defined populations. Insights gained from this work have potential benefit for women who have experienced a Trisomy 21 pregnancy, for their offspring directly, and, insofar as mechanisms of disease can be elucidated, the larger populations affected by diseases including Alzheimer?s Disease and breast cancer."

"8114844","The Core will manage animals (rabbits and mice) from which myocytes will be isolated at Loyola for use in all  4 of the projects. The mice used will include wild type and genetically modified mice that are developed and  bred in Core D at UCSD (including some that will be subjected to transverse aortic banding to induce  chronic pressure overload in Project by Brown). The rabbits used will include both control and heart failure (HF)  rabbits (induced by combined pressure and volume overload). The core will also be responsible for the  preparation and functional monitoring of HF rabbits during the evolution of dysfunction (under the direction  of Dr. S.M. Pogwizd at UIC). The core will also culture adult cardiac myocytes for 24-48 hours for studies  involving adenoviral gene transfer. These myocytes will be used directly by the three Loyola projects (l-lll)  for functional, imaging and biochemical analysis and also by Project by Brown for biochemical analysis (after  experimental treatment by the investigators at Loyola and shipment to UCSD). The procedures carried out  are specialized, but the personnel involved are expert in their respective roles and this should run smoothly  and efficiently in making the best use of the myocytes available.  Mice are especially valuable because of the opportunity to genetically manipulate the molecules under  investigation (and we are taking advantage of that in The Genetic Mouse Models and Adenoviruses Core) and collectively we have extensive experience  with mouse myocytes and cardiovascular disease models. The mouse work will be complemented by  studies in rabbit, where similar genetic manipulation is not practical, but rabbits are highly advantageous  here for two major reasons. First, the electrophysiological and Ca handling properties in rabbit ventricle are  very similar to that in human. Second, we have already developed a well-characterized rabbit model of  heart failure. Indeed, the HF rabbits manifest both severely depressed LV contractile function and  spontaneously-occurring ventricular arrhythmias. Rabbit myocytes are also well suited for the measurements  to be made (including: voltage clamp, fluorescence imaging, biochemical and molecular studies, and  in vitro adenoviral gene transfer. The services provided by this core are essential to the successful  completion of the science in Projects by Bers, Blatter, Mignery, and Brown, enabling the elucidation of mechanistic roles of IP3R and CaMKII in ECC, arrhythmogenesis, hypertrophy and HF."
"9324693","Abstract  Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common type of childhood cancer. Despite the remarkable progress over the past decades in curing ALL resulting from the refinement of multiagent chemotherapeutic and radiotherapy regiments, relapsed ALL remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children. The proposed project is based on two clinical observations that cannot be explained by current understanding of leukemia growth and relapse. I hypothesize that chemo-resistant cells are out-competed by other cells in ALL patients with late relapse and in ALL patients who undergo maintenance therapy. In addition, chemo-sensitive cells are out-competed by other ALL cells in patients with early relapse. To test this hypothesis, I will track individual ALL cells in vivo using a single cell tracking technology that was previously developed in our lab. This novel approach will allow the tracing of thousands of individual ALL cells simultaneously in mouse models and help identify the interactions between primary human ALL cells. The goal is to exploit cellular competition and communication to develop novel treatment strategies. These findings will greatly enhance the understanding of ALL relapse and pave the path to new therapeutic strategies that target specific ALL clones."
"9398081","The goal of this proposal is to establish in vitro tissue chip models of the closely related neurological disorders tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) epilepsy, DEPDC5-associated epilepsy, and their associated cardiac dysfunction. The proposed research leverages emerging bioengineering technology for microphysiological systems developed at the Vanderbilt Institute for Integrative Biosystems Research and Education (VIIBRE) with human induced pluripotent stem cell tools in regular use at Vanderbilt University Medical Center to ask probing questions about genetic disorders that afflict the heart and brain and about the drugs to treat them. The VIIBRE neurovascular unit (NVU)/blood-brain barrier and cardiac I-Wire organ-on-chip models will test the hypothesis that mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling differentially affect neural and cardiac dysfunction in TSC- and DEPDC5-associated epilepsy. The primary and shared abnormality in patients with TSC and DEPDC5- associated epilepsy is dysregulation of the mTOR kinase complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway. TSC also has abnormalities in mTORC2 signaling not seen in DEPDC5-associated epilepsy. A focus on mTOR signaling in these human mTORopathies has several advantages. First, rapamycin and related compounds are FDA- approved mTORC1 inhibitors and have been shown to have efficacy in some aspects of the disease manifestations of TSC. Second, TSC- and DEPDC5-associated epilepsy are both associated with neural and cardiac dysfunction. Third, the role for compensatory or differential mTORC2 activity is unclear and controversial. For patients with TSC, drugs targeting the mTORC1 signaling pathway have been associated with shrinkage of brain tumors, reduced seizures, and improved cardiac function. Thus, drug development for this group of diseases is well suited for study using both the NVU and I-Wire cardiac-tissue chips. In its first two years, the project will develop the NVU and I-Wire disease models, aimed at refining the TSC and DEPDC5 NVU model; applying the I-Wire model to TSC and DEPDC5 cardiomyocytes; and validating outcome methodologies in control and patient-derived NVU and I-Wire chips. The next three years aim to evaluate, for biomarker identification in control, TSC, and DEPDC5 NVU and I-Wire chips, changes in mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling, protein markers of cellular health and toxicity, metabolites, functional measures and electrophysiological activity; and, use ion mobility-mass spectrometry to evaluate NVU and I-Wire outcome measures plus drug metabolites after treatment with mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin, the seizure drug vigabatrin, and novel pre-clinical mTOR drug candidates. The NVU and I-Wire will assess the efficacy and toxicity of these agents and define TSC/DEPDC5 shared vs disease-specific effects. With this organ-on-chip/human induced pluripotent stem cell platform, it will be possible to address currently confounding mechanisms of pathogenesis, identify new disease biomarkers, quantify how drugs cross the normal and diseased blood-brain barrier, and ultimately develop effective therapies and hence enable bench-to-bedside translation."
"8114779","Endothelial cells play an important role in determining the risk for atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease  (CAD). Exercise may restore/preserve a healthy endothelium and limit atherosclerosis. An important part of  this project will be to determine in a well-controlled porcine model, the effects of exercise on the expression  of a group of proteins known to have a central role in determining the risk of vascular disease. The  experiments are focused on a set of putative PPAR-responsive mRNAs/proteins and lipoprotein lipase (LPL).  LPL is a rate-limiting enzyme for the metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, and as such, high levels of  LPL activity have been associated with the metabolic demands of exercise. The effect of LPL-dependent  lipolysis on the phenotype of endothelial cells is still largely unclear and needs to be elucidated. A strength  of these experiments is that they employ a multifaceted and collaborative approach to accomplish a definitive  set of hypothesis-driven studies. Molecular studies will determine the mRNA and protein targets regulated  directly by LPL-dependent signaling in endothelial cells (Aim 1). This aim will use a wide-range of  experimental culture conditions involving different amounts of LPL activity, purified lipoprotein substrates, RNA  interference for signaling studies, and pharmacological ligands to compare with lipoprotein derived ligands.  Aim 1 will also test for interactions during exposure to TNFa as a pro-inflammatory cytokine. More  physiological studies will be performed in isolated conduit arteries while determining the interactions between  chemical signals caused by experimentally reducing and increasing LPL activity, and the hemodynamic  signaling caused by altering flow rate over a wide range (Aim 2). Exercise training studies will determine how  LPL and a group of related proteins are regulated in different vascular sites (Aim 3). Aim 3 will be a very  complete examination of exercise responses because it will determine the effects of training in pigs fed a  normal fat diet before there is a risk of CAD, in a model of risk for early CAD, and in more advanced CAD.  These studies will provide important novel insights about regulation of LPL activity, and the mechanisms  involved in determining a healthy endothelial cell phenotype."
"9298700","?    DESCRIPTION        DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R01 resubmission Efficacy of a Prenatal Yoga Intervention for Antenatal Depression is in response to NICHD PA-12-216, Women's Mental Health During Pregnancy and the Postpartum Period.  Antenatal depression is common and associated with adverse outcomes for mother and child, yet the majority of affected women do not receive any mental health treatment. Pregnant women have unique concerns about treatment acceptability and are often reluctant to take antidepressants, the most widely available form of depression care. Prenatal yoga is an excellent candidate for a depression intervention that might be efficacious as well as acceptable and safe during pregnancy. There is evidence to support the efficacy of yoga for depression in the general population, as well as plausible biological and psychological mechanisms (e.g., decreased inflammation, increased non-judgment of internal experiences) by which yoga might have an impact on depression. Moreover, prenatal yoga has been associated with health benefits in non- depressed pregnant women (decreased pain, more optimal pregnancy outcomes). Yet, to date, no rigorously designed RCTs have examined the efficacy of prenatal yoga for antenatal depression. Our interdisciplinary team was funded by NIH to develop and pilot test the Prenatal Yoga Program (PYP) for depressed pregnant women. We developed an extensive manual and teacher training program and conducted an open pilot trial (N=34), followed by a pilot RCT (N=20), which compared PYP to a perinatal-focused health education program that controlled for time and attention, namely, the Mom & Baby Wellness Workshop (MBWW). Results of our pilot studies provide strong support for the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of PYP. We now propose to conduct a fully-powered RCT in which 178 depressed pregnant women in their 2nd trimester are randomly assigned to either PYP or MBWW for a 9 week intervention period. In addition to testing the efficacy of PYP, this trial will examine change in biological and psychological factors that may mediate the relationship between treatment group and outcome. Methodology employed will include best practices for a RCT of behavioral intervention, including use of detailed manuals for each study condition, methods for documenting instructor fidelity, blinded outcome assessment, and planned intent-to-treat analysis. The specific aims include: (1) comparing PYP to MBWW in terms of level of depression severity from baseline to intervention endpoint (i.e., 9 weeks after randomization); (2) comparing PYP to MBWW on secondary outcomes (self-reported antenatal depression, anxiety, physical functioning, and sleep disturbance; and rates of preterm birth); and (3) testing biological and psychological mechanisms by examining whether lowered inflammation levels and increased non-judgment of internal experiences mediate the association between treatment group and primary outcome. This study would be the first rigorously-designed RCT of prenatal yoga as an intervention for antenatal depression, a highly prevalent and impairing condition with known risks to mother and child."
"9304206","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Systemic amyloid diseases such as the transthyretin (TTR) amyloidoses are a class of devastating disorders caused by the pathologic aggregation and deposition of specific destabilized proteins as amyloid fibrils on tissues distal from the site of protein synthesis. Currently, no non-invasive therapies exist to treat the majority of these diseases, making systemic amyloidoses a large unmet medical need. A primary factor defining the pathologic extracellular protein aggregation central to these disorders is the secretion of destabilized, amyloidogenic proteins from effector tissues such as the liver. The efficient secretion of these proteins increases serum concentrations of amyloidogenic protein available for pathologic, concentration-dependent aggregation, directly impacting disease pathogenesis in patients. Clinical results from liver transplant recipients show that reducing serum concentrations of amyloidogenic proteins can decrease pathologic protein aggregation, attenuate peripheral proteotoxicity and improve prognosis for patients presenting with a variety of distinct systemic amyloidoses. We hypothesize that activating the endogenous Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) signaling pathways that regulate protein secretion from effector tissues is a non-invasive strategy to similarly decrease secretion and reduce extracellular concentrations of amyloidogenic proteins available for pathologic extracellular aggregation. Consistent with this prediction, we show that activating the UPR- associated transcription factor ATF6 reduces secretion of destabilized, amyloidogenic TTR mutants, but does not affect the secretion of wild-type TTR or the endogenous secreted proteome. Here, we employ TTR as a model amyloidogenic protein to show that ATF6 activation has therapeutic potential to reduce pathologic extracellular aggregation and proteotoxicity of amyloidogenic TTR mutants using a novel patient-derived, multi- system induced pluripotent stem cell model of TTR amyloid disease that recapitulates nearly all aspects of TTR amyloid disease pathology observed in patients. Furthermore, we are extending this analysis to show that ATF6 activation similarly reduces the secretion and proteotoxicity of amyloidogenic proteins involved in other systemic amyloid diseases including Light Chain Amyloidosis - an acquired systemic amyloid disease that affects >1 million individuals worldwide. Through these efforts, we will show that the stress-independent activation of UPR-associated signaling pathways such as that regulated by ATF6 is a broadly-applicable therapeutic strategy to reduce the secretion and pathologic extracellular aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins associated with multiple systemic amyloid diseases. These results will further motivate our ongoing high- throughput screening efforts to identify ATF6 activators, as a single small molecule ATF6 activator has the potential to treat multiple systemic amyloidoses (i.e. a one-drug:multiple-disease therapeutic paradigm) dramatically improving the economics of translating selective ATF6 activators into the clinic to ameliorate pathologic extracellular aggregation associated with these diseases."
"9302626","Alcohol use disorders (AUDS) impact millions of individuals and constitute one of the most serious public  health problems worldwide. Despite its devastating impact on society, only a few effective medications are  currently available. Orexins/hypocretins are hypothalamic peptides that act via orexin receptors that have  been linked to regulating feeding and sleep. In addition, the orexin system has been shown to play an  important role in alcohol self-administration and in stress-induced reinstatement. These effects are thought to  be mediated by orexin containing neurons that project from the lateral hypothalamus to the ventral tegmental  area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) or from the perifornical regions to the amygdala respectively.  However, the role of orexins through orexin receptors and their signaling pathway in driving ethanol-mediated  behaviors is less explored. The overall goal of this research project, component 6 of the NIAAA-Gallo  Center application is to determine the role of orexins, orexin receptors and their downstream signaling  pathways in different brain regions in ethanol-mediated behaviors.  The Center provides a unique opportunity to apply a multidisciplinary approach that integrates behavioral,  biochemical and electrophysiological techniques in the latest animal models of binge drinking, ethanol self-administration and stress-induced reinstatement. The research aims to understand the role of orexin-mediated  synaptic and cellular mechanisms in the central amygdala, VTA and NAc using behavioral models  of alcohol addiction.  In Aim 6.1, we will determine whether Ox-Rs in the central amygdala drive stress-induced reinstatement of  ethanol seeking. In Aim 6.2, we will apply electrophysiological and biochemical techniques to dissect the  signaling pathways underlying orexins effects in the central amygdala. In Aim 6.3, we will determine the  mechanism of action of orexins in the VTA and the NAc in regulating binge ethanol consumption and ethanol  self-administration. Orexins/hypocretins play a crucial role in addiction, the sleep-wake cycle, motivation and  stress, and this provides a strong rationale for our proposed studies, the experiments outlined have been  designed specifically to lead to clinical studies aimed at determining the efficacy of orexin receptor  antagonists in human subjects with AUDs."
"9312815","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this application is to design and develop enantioselective phosphine-catalyzed annulations and to apply them in the chemical syntheses of natural products, their analogs, and unnatural small organic molecules of medicinal significance. Building on our successful studies of phosphine catalysis reactions and their applications in the total syntheses of medicinally useful natural products [(+)-ibophyllidine (?)-alstonerine, (?)-macroline, (?)-hirsutine, 3-deoxyisoochracinic acid, isoochracinic acid, isoochracinol], here we propose the development of new phosphine catalysis reactions and novel chiral phosphines. Specifically, we will prepare three families of new [2.2.1] bicyclic chira phosphines from a naturally occurring amino acid (trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline) and a terpenoid (carvone). These new phosphines have already displayed tremendous potential in facilitating enantioselective [3+2] and [4+2] annulations between allenes and imines. To build on these exciting preliminary observations, we propose to synthesize (-)-actinophyllic acid and (+) - ajmaline through enantioselective allene-imine [3+2] and [4+2] annulations, respectively, and another indole alkaloid, (+)-hirsutine, through the catalytic asymmetric allene-imine [4+2] annulation. In addition, we wish to develop new phosphine-catalyzed and -mediated reactions. We will examine and expand upon two hypotheses in the area of new reaction development: (i) tandem umpolung addition/Wittig olefination and (ii) sequential phosphine/transition metal catalysis. The proposed research could significantly expand the principles of organic reactions and provide new methods and reagents for the synthetic organic chemist's toolbox. Many innovations will be necessary to successfully implement our three specific aims. Our preliminary results have been strong in all three specific areas, supporting the likelihood of further successes. The small molecules described in this proposal are medicinally important, possessing activities related to diseases such as thrombosis [(-)-actinophyllic acid], hypertension and arrhythmia [(+)-ajmaline], influenzas [(+)-hirsutine], neurological disorders (glutamate receptor antagonist), and cardiac diseases and cancer (shihunidine). Successful completion of this proposed study would significantly impact the synthetic organic chemistry community by introducing a series of new chiral phosphines readily accessible from inexpensive natural products; in fact, we are collaborating with Sigma-Aldrich to make these chiral phosphines available to the scientific community. In addition to using these chiral phosphines in the proposed organocatalysis reactions, they should also serve as ligands for transition metal-catalyzed processes. Therefore, the proposed research could significantly increase the efficiencies of various synthetic organic processes."
"9301024","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to create new software and analysis methods designed to make possible the exploration of a unique dataset, the 1,004 genomes sequenced by the Consortium on Asthma among African-Ancestry Populations in the Americas (CAAPA). The size of this dataset, over 130 Terabytes, currently prevents it from being explored with alignment-based tools, and researchers instead are limited to using the much smaller files containing single-nucleotide variants. Our proposed software will make this dataset and others like it available for real- time searching, a capability that is not yet possible for any genomic database of this size.  Since the early 1990s, scientists have used DNA sequence databases to study a wide range of problems, including novel gene discovery, mutation detection, the investigation of larger structural variants, and evolutionary processes. The ability to search all known genes and genomes using BLAST and similar programs has long been assumed, and sequence search engines throughout the world provide this ability. However, the vast size of the CAAPA dataset makes it impossible to search the data itself using current tools. One cannot look for specific mutations, extract and re-analyze data for any particular gene or regulatory region, or look for structural variants.  Newer, fast next-generation sequence alignment programs such as Bowtie, originally developed in our group, allow far faster alignment of NGS reads to the genome, but even these programs cannot search data on the scale of CAAPA in real time. Different architectures need to be designed and built to accommodate these very large datasets. The CAAPA exploration system (CESYS) will use a combination of a highly efficient database, very fast storage, and fast search algorithms to achieve our goals.  This project aims to accomplish several goals that will dramatically enhance the value of CAAPA. First, the data will be made available to a very large community of researchers, who can use it not only to study the genetics of asthma and allergy in the CAAPA populations, but also to compare these subjects to other groups. The data currently resides on hard drives and is available only to a small number of the project's PIs, a situation that limits its value. Second, b creating an authentication system consistent with dbGaP, we will create a data sharing model that other projects can use and that will remove some of the technical barriers to sharing genome data from human subjects. Third, as part of building the database, we will re-call all the SNPs using the newly released human genome build (hg20), creating a consistent set of variants that we will also share freely through the project database. Fourth, we will identify all bacterial contaminants, including those in a subset of subjects known to have bloodstream infections at the time of sample collection. Fifth, we will identify structural variants unique to he CAAPA population, which we can then explore for any association with the risk of asthma."
"9207547","DIVISION OF NONHUMAN PRIMATE SYSTEMS BIOLOGY  PROJECT SUMMARY The Division of Nonhuman Primate Systems Biology provides an investigative and resource infrastructure to create and use genomic, proteomic, and computational methods to improve the translational impact of nonhuman primate biomedical models. The Division conducts research and resource development activities in the broad area of nonhuman primate systems biology and includes two service cores, the High-throughput Molecular Profiling Core and the Statistical Analysis and Computational Modeling Core. Global molecular profiling and computational resources can be accessed by external investigators through collaboration with Division scientists or directly through the Cores using a fee-for-service mechanism. Specific Aims associated with the research and resource development activities of the Division include: 1) Develop advanced methods for microbiome and single-cell transcriptome analysis for use with nonhuman primate models. The interplay between the microbiome and host health and disease is an exciting and burgeoning area of research. The development of these methods will better define this interrelationship with the goal of future manipulation to enhance therapeutic strategies or to improve vaccine efficacy. Additionally, in collaboration with Dr. Alex Shalek (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), single-cell transcriptome analysis and RNA profiling will be performed on individual cells from specific immune cell-types isolated from nonhuman primates under different conditions. Insights will be gained as to how and why individual cells respond differently to the same condition and how these responses change between conditions. This high resolution view of transitions between states will ultimately lead to a better understanding of both intra- and intercellular regulatory circuits and the dynamic responses of multicellular populations. 2) Develop molecular profiling and computational approaches for quantifying transcript expression from complex immune loci such as the rhesus macaque major histocompatibility (MHC) loci or FC-? receptor genes. These genes serve critical roles in host immune responses and are associated with many human diseases including HIV infection and AIDS. Therefore it is paramount to establish proven methods for determining differences in transcript levels between healthy and disease states. 3) Develop genome editing methods and resources for use in mechanism of action studies and for drug target validation. Systems-level analyses provide detailed information on host responses, which in turn can be used to identify mechanistic hypotheses or therapeutic targets. Similarly, genetic variations and polymorphisms can impact host susceptibility to infection or disease progression. Here, we will develop a combination of cell culture, genome editing, and computational approaches to engineer specific genetic variations into macaque CD4+ T cells and evaluate their effect on phenotypic outcomes. These results will identify potential gene targets in rhesus macaques for 1) drug treatment validation and 2) for genome modification with the long term goal of developing engineered models of human disease."
"9302527","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disruption of thalamic connectivity figures prominently in hypotheses on the neural circuitry involved in schizophrenia. In contrast to robust evidence for such disruption from imaging studies, investigations on its underlying pathology lag far behind. Here, we focus on axonal pathways and myelinating cells within the mediodorsal nucleus (MD), a large thalamic nucleus interconnected with the frontal cortex through massive myelinated axon pathways and known to be involved in schizophrenia. We place our investigations in the context of emerging evidence for a role of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and in the regulation of brain connectivity and myelination. We have shown that the expression of CSPGs, main components of the extracellular matrix, is markedly altered in glial cells and perineuronal nets (PNNs; CSPG-enriched extracellular matrix structures surrounding distinct neuronal populations) in several brain regions of subjects with schizophrenia. The relevance of these findings to neural connectivity resides in the powerful role that CSPGs, and their interactions with oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), play in axon guidance, fasciculation, myelination and impulse conduction. Preliminary results in human MD show axons enveloped by CSPG-enriched `axonal coats' and intimately associated with CSPG-expressing OPCs, as well as altered organization of myelinated fiber bundles in the MD of SZ subjects. Together, these considerations support the hypothesis that, in the MD of subjects with schizophrenia, altered CSPG expression in OPCs and axonal coats is associated with white matter/oligodendrocyte abnormalities and dysregulation of molecular pathways related to CSPGs and myelin biosynthesis and regulation. The proposed postmortem investigations will test this hypothesis using a combination of quantitative microscopy and proteomics/glycomics on MD samples from healthy control, schizophrenic and bipolar disorder subjects. Specific Aim 1 will elucidate the structure and composition of axonal coats, a novel extracellular matrix structure shown to surround axons in the human MD. Specific Aim 2 will use quantitative microscopy to test the hypothesis that, in the MD of subjects with schizophrenia, altered CSPG expression in OPCs and axonal coats is associated with disruption of myelination and oligodendrocyte reductions. Specific Aim 3 will use proteomics and glycomics analyses on the MD to test the hypothesis that CSPGs, myelin and molecular pathways related to their biosynthesis and regulation are disrupted in the MD of subjects with schizophrenia, thus setting microscopy studies in the context of focused hypotheses related to molecular mechanisms potentially responsible for abnormalities affecting CSPGs in axonal coats and OPCs. Specific Aim 4 will test the hypothesis that, in schizophrenia, CSPG/OPC/myelin abnormalities coexist with PNN decreases in a thalamic region, i.e. the reticular nucleus, which is particularly enriched in these ECM pericellular structures and plays a key role in gating prefrontal cortex-thalamus connectivity."

"9207546","BIOENGINEERING SERVICE CORE  PROJECT SUMMARY Advances at the cutting edge of biomedical research necessarily exploit an array of complex tools for measurement, control, and data analysis -- tools that not only need to be developed but may later require maintenance or enhancement. The Bioengineering Service Core [BSC] provides an avenue for researchers who are experts in biological sciences, but not necessarily in engineering or materials, to appropriately use modern technology in solving problems encountered while investigating biomedical questions. The functions of the Bioengineering Core include [1] selection, modification, design, or fabrication of equipment for new or expanded investigations, [2] priority repair of malfunctioning devices responsible for the failure of existing experiments; [3] development of devices to enhance or monitor the health of non-human primates, or technology that reduces their physical restraints, and [4] training of researchers and students in the best use of existing equipment, and dissemination of instrument design documents. As conceived in the legislation that created the Centers, BSC has no research or development program of its own. Funding BSC makes it possible to have a shared facility that reduces the overall cost of critical specialized technical instruments and services. These are provided to a wide community of investigators. BSC staff disseminate their expertise outside our Center to other investigators employing non-human primates through the education of visiting scientists and students and via a web site which is used to share instrument design. Many of BSC's personnel have been with the Center for 10 to 20 years, so it has developed a collective wealth of experience regarding which instrumentation will perform competently in experiments with the intelligent, inquisitive and dexterous non-human primate. These capabilities would be more expensive to achieve and maintain if they were funded by individual researchers. In the previous 5-years, Bioengineering supported 58 PIs using 164 budgets to perform 1319 contracted jobs. Analyzing same-period labor records shows that 51% of BSC effort was spent on jobs for Neuro Core Staff at the WaNPRC, 29% for affiliated researchers at the University of Washington, 13% for Colony and other Center support operations; and 8% for investigators from other institutions. A user survey conducted independently of BSC - by the WaNPRC Administration - showed that the vast majority of PIs using Bioengineering Services considered these services ?critical? to the success of their investigations. Due to the cost (both financial and delay) of developing wholly new materials or basic electronic devices, BSC uses existing technologies to solve the needs of the biologists. The complexity of modern technology still requires substantial expertise to achieve the required performance and reliability. New technologies are introduced as they become practical on small production scales. P51 funding currently covers about 50% of BSC costs, the balance covered by RO1 and similar investigator grants that are separately vetted."

"9257895","Project Summary / Abstract Obesity and low bone quality (osteopenia/osteoporosis) are prevalent public health issues worldwide, contributing significantly to metabolic disease and fracture risk. A growing body of evidence suggests that environmental exposures are contributing to the incidence and severity of these pathological conditions. Both legacy Superfund chemicals (organotins, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB)) and Superfund chemicals of emerging concern (organophosphate flame retardants) have been recognized as metabolic and bone disruptors. While a strong physiological coupling of obesity and osteoporosis may seem unlikely, the recent discoveries of fat and bone regulatory crosstalk suggest that they share common origins. Adipose and bone tissue each contain multipotent cells whose differentiation and fate are regulated by common nuclear receptors. One such nuclear receptor is the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor ? (PPAR?), an essential regulator of adipocyte differentiation and function and a negative regulator of bone homeostasis. Critical gaps in our knowledge prevent our understanding of the potential for environmental PPAR? activators to contribute to development of disease, including: 1) how environmental PPAR? ligands disrupt metabolic health, whereas therapeutic PPAR? ligands used to treat type 2 diabetes improve metabolic health; 2) whether developmental exposures program both adipose and bone dysfunction in adulthood, and 3) how environmental PPAR? activators interact with other classes of adipose- and bone-disrupting chemicals (e.g. PCBs). Our novel and compelling preliminary data show that that tributyltin (TBT) alters adipose and bone differentiation in vitro and adipose and bone homeostasis in vivo, through its interaction with PPAR? and with the retinoid X receptor (RXR). We identified a novel PPAR? ligand, the common organophosphate flame retardant triphenyl phosphate (TPhP), which coordinately enhances adipocyte differentiation and suppresses bone formation in vitro. TPhP stimulates adipose accumulation and hepatic steatosis following adult exposures, and lipodystrophy and systemic inflammation following perinatal exposures. TPhP and TBT activate PPAR?, but also induce adipocyte transcriptomes that are distinct from those induced by a therapeutic PPAR? ligand. Here, we propose to investigate the hypothesis that TPhP and TBT selectively modulate PPAR??s activation and function to compromise adipose and bone homeostasis. We will address three Specific Aims: 1) to determine how early life exposures to TPhP and TBT impact adipose and bone homeostasis in adulthood; 2) to define how selective activation of PPAR? by TPhP and TBT modifies adipocyte function, and 3) to define the roles of PPAR? and RXR in disruption of osteoblast/osteoclast function and crosstalk by TPhP and TBT. Collectively, our work will enhance our knowledge of the physiological processes driving adipose and bone dyshomeostasis and of how early life toxicant exposures exacerbate risk of developing disease, contributing to our ability to minimize/prevent chronic disability caused by exposure to Superfund chemicals."
"9325534","Our overall objective is to determine the molecular mechanisms by which immune dysregulation leads to  human disease, specifically the atopic diseases of food allergy, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis and  allergic asthma in the children exposed to high levels of PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons). We  previously published work on an important link between PAH exposure in AAP and changes at the DNA level  in immune cells that led to their impaired function. This decrease in cell function was directly associated with  increases in Th2 cytokines, IL-4 and IL-13, and subsequent clinical outcomes of allergy and asthma,  including decreased lung function, in the same pediatric subjects. However, the effect of these cellular  changes on allergic disorders was not evaluated at the time; therefore, we will focus on the effects of PAH  and will determine whether PAH exposure is associated with systemic immune dysregulation, leading to  atopic diseases (food allergy, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, and allergic asthma). T cells are key  mediators of the adaptive immune system and play critical roles in modulating inflammation (specifically  regulatory T cells or Treg) and inducing allergy (i.e., Th2 effector cells which can lead to isotype switching of  B cells to synthesize IgE, a molecule associated with allergies). To date, we have focused our studies on  isolated T cell subsets; and, in this proposal, we will conduct studies on Th subsets to be able to elucidate  the full mechanisms of how PAHs modulate the immune system. To do this, our approach is to perform a  cross-sectional analysis in a well defined piece-wise continuum of all pediatric ages in immune  development for whom detailed information will be collected on human disease outcomes and for whom  blood, saliva, and urine samples will be collected at repeated time points. We plan to use novel and  innovative immunological studies including epigenetic pyrosequencing studies on single cells and massspectrometry  based flow cytometry for detection of 38 simultaneous immune cell parameters. In this way,  we will be able to determine key time points of sensitivity of the immune system to PAH exposure by defining  the molecular mechanisms that play a role in immune system impairment during immune development."

"9261304","PROJECT SUMMARY The ventricular conduction system (VCS) is a multicellular network comprised of highly specialized cardiomyocytes that orchestrate the near synchronous excitation and contraction of working ventricular myocardium. Purkinje cells (PCs) comprise the most distal portion of the VCS and they have been implicated as arrhythmic triggers in acquired and inherited forms of arrhythmia. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for PC pro-arrhythmic behavior is incompletely understood, precluding the development of rationally-based therapies for these conditions. Through differential transcriptional profiling of highly enriched populations of cardiac PCs vs. working ventricular myocytes (VMs), our lab identified the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R), a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR), as being highly enriched in PCs compared to VMs. Based on the established role of this receptor in cellular excitability within the nervous system, we hypothesized that D2R modulates PC electrophysiology and may play a potential role in the arrhythmogenic potential of these cells in the VCS. Using a panel of selective D2R ligands and arrhythmogenic animal models, we are evaluating the role of D2R in PC physiology and disease pathogenesis. These studies could lead to D2R as a novel target to ameliorate PC-dependent arrhythmias."
"9312141","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal is to reduce the prevalence of child obesity, which has been declared one of the major public health challenges of the 21st century by the World Health Organization. The immediate purpose of the proposed study is to evaluate the impact of obesity-related interventions and policies on early childhood obesity risk in communities throughout Los Angeles County, a socio-demographically diverse region with a population of 10 million. An interdisciplinary team from UCLA and UC Berkeley will form partnerships with the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (LACDPH), Public Health Foundation Enterprises WIC (PHFE WIC) [the largest local agency Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) in the country], and California Food Policy Advocates (CFPA) to develop new evaluation research methodology using systems science approaches, for this purpose.  The proposed study will challenge and shift current paradigms in evaluation research methodology by (1) using outcome data (obesity status in preschool-aged children) from a large administrative database; (2) developing a methodology for retrospectively quantifying the impact of community efforts to address obesity or obesity-related behaviors (diet and physical activity), and (3) pioneering the combined use of causal inference methods and systems science approaches for the analysis. The administrative database providing the outcome data has been maintained by PHFE WIC since 2003; it contains height and weight data gathered from about ~ 200,000 two to five year old WIC participants each year. These data have recently been evaluated for validity and shown to correlate highly with measurements taken by a research team from UCLA. The methodology for quantifying the impact of obesity-related community interventions and policies on early childhood obesity will use existing data gathered by LACDPH as well as information from interviews with key informants identified with the help of LACDPH and CFPA (two organizations highly knowledgeable about community efforts to address child obesity in LA County), to develop an index; development of this index will borrow from the experiences of research groups that have conducted similar work in the field of tobacco control. The application of causal inference methods, which perhaps represent the fastest growing methodological advances in epidemiology, in combination with systems science approaches to analyze the data will shift current paradigms in evaluation research methodology, allowing for the assessment of the effects of unplanned mixtures of possibly time-varying interventions."
"9373089","Statement of Work There is an urgent need for improved diagnostic tests for the evaluation of the etiology of febrile states, particularly in immunocompromised hosts. This project will develop host-based biomarker signatures capable of identifying the presence and pathogen class of infections in vulnerable immunocompromised human subjects, thus potentially allowing for earlier, more directed (and thus more effective) therapy as well as reducing the need for potentially harmful empiric anti-infective therapy. In this study we will a) perform high dimensional gene expression analysis on existing samples of at-risk hosts with proven candidemia, viral infection, bacterial infection, or noninfectious illness, b) develop peripheral blood-based gene expression signatures of candidemia and c) generate a combined multinomial classifier capable of differentiating four clinical states: viral infection, bacterial infection, fungal infection (candidemia) and noninfectious illness. The enclosed work offers a true paradigm shift in the way febrile illnesses in this high-risk population are diagnosed and managed."
"9515106","Abstract: The most common form of autosomal recessive hereditary deafness is due to loss of the Connexin 26 (Cx26) protein (encoded by the human GJB2 gene). In mice, loss of Cx26 (Gjb2) leads to impaired glucose transport in the placenta and early embryonic death, whereas conditional loss restricted to the inner ear results in hearing impairment and death of epithelial and neuronal cells in the cochlea. Mouse models for reduced Cx26 exhibit many of the features found in humans with Gjb2 mutations, but the models display a more severe phenotype than humans. Specifically, onset of pathology in mice is earlier, hearing loss is progressive and more severe, and spiral ganglion neuron (SGN) degeneration occurs. The underlying mechanisms for these differences in phenotypes are unclear, but may be related to developmental or cell type-specific expression and/or functions of Cx26. The pan-otocyst deletions selected for some mouse models may also be responsible for the extremely severe mouse phenotypes. Here, we propose to use a mouse model we have recently generated (Sox10Cre-Gjb2) in which Cre, driven by the promoter of the supporting cell gene Sox10, is used for deleting Gjb2. Sox10Cre-Gjb2 mice exhibit hearing loss and degeneration of the cochlear epithelium, and SGNs which appear less severe than other existing models. Using our mice, we will characterize critical roles for Cx26 during the development of the cochlea prior to the onset of hearing, versus its roles in function and survival of hair cells, supporting cells and neurons in the mature inner ear. Our team of investigators with a strong history of productive collaboration, will test the global hypothesis that Cx26 exhibits critical requirements for promotion of sensory epithelial and neuronal function and integrity that are temporal (i.e. embryonic vs. early postnatal vs adult) and cell type-specific, and that functional effects of loss of Cx26 can be corrected by gene replacement. We have three Specific Aims: (1) Characterize inner ear structure/function in mice with loss of Cx26 in supporting cells, (2) Test whether Cx26 exhibits temporal and cell type-specific requirements for promotion of cochlear epithelial cell and spiral ganglion cell function and integrity, and (3) Determine if Ad.CX26-GFP is sufficient to (a) restore functional gap junctions in the auditory epithelium as determined by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and immunocytochemistry, (b) improve ABR thresholds and (c) rescue hair cells, supporting cells, and neurons in Gjb2 deficient mice. Results from these studies are poised to improve understanding of the pathophysiology of Gjb2 mutations in the ear, and accelerate development of specific and effective gene-based therapies for human Cx26 related deafness."
"9305124","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preterm birth is a significant health problem in the U.S. resulting in a large economic burden to society and a major impact on quality of life for survivors and their families. Surviving extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants born at less than 1000 grams have a high rate of neurodevelopmental delay. During the neonatal period, ELBW infants require blood transfusions due to frequent blood sampling and an immature bone marrow response. The ideal hemoglobin level at which to transfuse is not known and there are conflicting data as to whether targeting a higher hemoglobin improves neurodevelopmental outcome. Practices remain widely divergent in the absence of compelling data regarding risks and benefits. Transfusion of Prematures (TOP) (1U01HL112776-1), currently underway at the 18 clinical centers of NICHD's Neonatal Research Network (NRN), is a randomized clinical trial designed to determine whether the primary outcome of death or significant neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) in survivors at 22 to 26 months is less common among preterm infants maintained at a higher hemoglobin level. The following proposal is submitted in response to the Ancillary Studies in Clinical Trials RFA by Valerie Chock, MD MS, an early stage investigator with expertise in the use of near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in preterm infants. NIRS is a non-invasive bedside technology able to reliably measure regional tissue oxygenation of both cerebral and mesenteric tissues. Regional tissue oximetry may be a better measure of end-organ oxygenation than hemoglobin alone and may provide physiologic data predictive of NDI as well as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), an adverse outcome potentially related to transfusion in ELBW infants. One objective of this proposal is to determine differences in cerebral oxygenation and fractional tissue oxygen extraction with NIRS (Aim 1) between high and low hemoglobin threshold groups during red blood cell transfusions. We also propose to determine whether abnormal cerebral NIRS measures are a better predictor of NDI than hemoglobin alone (Aim 2) and whether abnormal mesenteric NIRS measures are associated with the development of NEC within the 48 hours following a transfusion (Aim 3). Eligible infants enrolled in the TOP trial will have cerebral and mesenteric NIRS monitoring during the first 7 days of life and during subsequent transfusions. With an estimated sample size of 490 infants, longitudinal analyses will determine the association between NIRS measures and transfusion threshold group. Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analyses will determine the predictive capability of abnormal NIRS measures for the outcome of death or NDI and the outcome of transfusion-associated NEC. The feasibility and success of this proposal is enhanced by collaboration with the TOP PIs and commitment by NRN centers to participate. The novel use of regional tissue oximetry will provide physiologic measures critical to understanding outcome differences in the TOP trial. This ancillary study will significantly improve knowledge of the benefits and risks of transfusions in the preterm neonate, resulting in optimized transfusion practices."

"9327508","Strong evidence links the development of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure (HF) to dramatic alterations in mitochondrial fuel metabolism and bioenergetics. Specifically, the capacity of the heart to oxidize its chief fuels, fatty acids (FA) and glucose, becomes constrained, causing compensatory shifts in metabolism to alternative substrates. Recent work in the Muoio lab using mouse models and a system biology approach has identified marked perturbations in short chain carbon metabolites (acetyl CoA, ketones and branched chain amino acids (BCAA)-derived intermediates) as a strong signature of HF. Likewise, emerging findings from the Newgard lab link cardiometabolic stress to aberrant BCAA metabolism and inactivation of anaplerotic pathways that refill intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Whereas static assessment of metabolite concentrations can highlight pathways deserving of further attention, measurement of metabolic flux is necessary to precisely pinpoint sites of metabolic dysregulation. Current heart perfusion methods to measure fluxes have several limitations including: 1) restriction to a single 13C-tracer per perfusion, despite various substrates of interest; 2) inadequate assessment of anaplerosis, as pyruvate is considered while other potentially important sources are ignored (e.g. BCAA-derived propionyl CoA); and 3) limited analysis of only a small fraction of the 13C-enrichment data generated in each experiment. To overcome these limitations, this project aims to develop and validate a powerful 13C-based ?multiplex? MFA method, wherein several 13C- substrates (namely glucose, lactate, FA, and BCAA) can be applied to a single heart perfusion to evaluate substrate oxidation and anaplerotic fluxes, with emphasis on fluxes around the pyruvate, acetyl CoA and propionyl CoA nodes. This ?multiplex? technique will reduce mouse sample size required for perfusions, while simultaneously increasing quality and quantity of flux information obtained. Lastly, this project will apply the ?multiplex? MFA method to the carnitine acetyltransferase (CrAT) knockout mouse, which is a well-characterized model of altered acetyl and propionyl CoA metabolism. BCAA will serve as tool compounds to probe both acetyl CoA and propionyl CoA metabolism in CrAT- deficient hearts. Overall, this study will advance long-term goals of defining potential roles of CrAT and BCAA metabolism as factors that contribute to adaptive/maladaptive remodeling of the failing heart."

The Clinical Core has extensive experience in both the recruitment and screening, as well as clinical phenotyping of various populations used in numerous clinical research studies. In the 9 months precedingthe submission of this current proposal,a total of 137 individuals have already been assessed and phenotyped for COPD-related clinical research studies through the facilities and resources of the Clinical Core. The Core has access to state-of-theart facilities and equipment with which to carry out procedures, including bronchoscopy, quantitative CT chest scans, and nuclear medicine assessments, integral to phenotyping subjects and obtaining high- quality biologic materials in sufficient quantities for each project. It is staffed by highly qualified physician-scientists with extensive experience in safely conducting bronchoscopies on human research subjects, using previously established methodology for collection of human airway epithelium and alveolar macrophages. As part of these methodologies, the Clinical Core will implement techniques it has more recently established and validated for procurement of airway epithelium from the small airways, as well as obtaining samples over time for assessment of the gene expression pattern in response to brush injury to the airway epithelium, mimicking repair processeswhich may result in the pathologic and physiologic derangements noted in COPD.

"8114903","With the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the survival of individuals infected with HIV-1 has dramatically improved. However, recent recognition of the markedly accelerated development of emphysema in this population at an early age and with a minimal smoking history provides an opportunity to study the molecular basis for this problem. In this context, the emphysema of HIV-1/AIDS joins a1-antitrypsin deficiency as a clinical model of an accelerated form of lung destruction, and thus HIV-1+ individuals that smoke can serve as a model to understand the pathogenesis of emphysema. Based on the knowledge that the alveolar macrophage (AM) is the primary cell type of the lung that is chronically infected by HIV-1, and that the AM plays a central role in releasing mediators that mediate the lung destruction in smoking-ind.uced emphysema, we hypothesize that HIV-1 and cigarette smoke synergize to activate AM to express a transcriptome that is highly dangerous to the lung parenchyma. Its evaluation will help to identify the activation pathways that are most critical in the development of emphysema and represent pharmacologic targets. Based on this background, we propose to assess 3 specific aims. Aim 1. To test the hypothesis that HIV-1 infection and cigarette smoking act in concert to create a pattern of AM gene expression indicative of up-regulated expression of genes relevant to the pathogenesis of emphysema and that these changes are in excess of, or in addition to, that induced by smoking or HIV-1 alone. Aim 2. Based on the knowledge that HIV-1 infection is associated with elevated systemic and lung levels of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and interferon-Y (IFN-v), and that expression of TNF-a or IFN-v in the lungs of experimental animals is associated with the development of emphysema, we will examine the hypothesis that the exaggerated program of emphysema-related mediators expressed by AM of HIV-1+ smokers is linked to the overexpression of TNF-a and/or IFN-y in the lung. Aim 3. To examine the hypothesis that while HAART therapy effectively suppresses replication of HIV-1 in the AM, it does not entirely suppress the pattern of gene expression of the AM relevant to the pathogenesis of emphysema, and that the persistence of the subset of up-regulated genes in the AM is linked to TNF-a or INF-v in the milieu of the alveolus."
"9530076","While 45 to 65% of youth in the juvenile system meet criteria for substance use disorders (SUDs), less than  half have ever received treatment, and less than one third of those received treatment while under community  or correctional supervision. Prevention and treatment are critical given that onset of SUD during adolescence  can lead to significantly longer periods of substance use, more severe offending, and penetration in the justice  system. Complicating things further, SUD severity is associated with HIV and other sexually transmitted  infections, and mental health problems. Despite the preponderance of evidence demonstrating these youths?  unmet SUD and HIV needs, the short and long-term consequences resulting from their unmet needs, the low  implementation rates of evidence-based treatments, and low service utilization rates, a number of agency and  system level factors serve to further widen the gap between need and service utilization. Through 3-5  Research Centers (RC), and one Coordinating Center (CC), the NIDA TRIALS cooperative will seek to improve  the continuum of evidence-based services including HIV prevention available to youth within the juvenile  justice system. The proposed CC combines the collective experiences of Dr. Michael Dennis and Dr. Chris  Scott in operating 6 juvenile justice and 7 adolescent treatment coordinating centers across the continuum of  juvenile settings (e.g., diversion, drug court, probation, detention, community re-entry, parole), prevention,  treatment, and recovery settings. The Coordinating Center?s AIMS are to: 1) conduct a national survey of  juvenile justice agencies that provides a context and comparison standard for the TRIALS pre-implementation  needs assessment and subsequent implementation studies; 2) coordinate each Research Center?s preimplementation needs assessment; 3) develop and manage a common data base infrastructure for cross-site  Research Implementation Studies, and 4) Provide state-of?the-art communications and logistical support for  the steering committee, workgroups, training activities and data safety monitoring board. Due to the complex  and time-sensitive nature of the Coordinating Center?s responsibilities, Drs. Michael Dennis and Christy Scott  will serve as PIs for the proposed TRIALS Coordinating Center. Having two highly experienced researchers  with complementary expertise work in tandem will ensure that our Coordinating Center will be able to  simultaneously develop and conduct the national survey of juvenile justice facilities, as well as help ensure that  the Research Centers meet the overall TRIALS research objectives."

Cynthia Brandt and Michael Krauthammer? is based in the Yale Center for Medical Informatics (YCMI) and other academic units at Yale, reflecting the diversity of Yale?s collaborative Biomedical Informatics research environment. Our training focuses on the following informatics areas: 1) health care/clinical informatics, 2) translational bioinformatics, and 3) clinical research informatics. Active research projects span a broad spectrum, from clinical decision support, to the development of new statistical and bioinformatics approaches in translational genomics, to computational modeling of disease processes. The scope of Biomedical Informatics activities is growing rapidly at Yale, with emerging opportunities in interdisciplinary projects tackling large biomedical data sets. Accordingly, the grant features mentors with expertise in Data Science, a curriculum with an elective focus on Biomedical Data Science, and provides training in interdisciplinary research. Predoctoral training is carried out primarily in Yale?s interdepartmental PhD program in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (CBB), which was inaugurated in 2003 and recently accepted its fourteenth class of students. Postdoctoral fellows with a doctoral degree in the health professions or in an area of science other than informatics may enroll in one of two research-oriented graduate programs: studying for an MS or PhD degree in CBB or for a Master of Health Science (MHS) degree in Yale's Clinical Informatics Track. For postdoctoral trainees who already have a doctoral degree in informatics or a closely related field, degree training may not be needed or appropriate. Postdoctoral training involves defining one or two research projects which can be carried out independently, under faculty supervision. Depending on their specific backgrounds and interests, postdoctoral fellows are encouraged to take part in in a variety of other activities, including participation in institutional computing activities in both the clinical and bioscience arenas. The overall goal is to provide all trainees with the necessary background and experience that will allow them to pursue productive academic and research careers in Biomedical Informatics and Data Science.

"8114913","In the airway of normal individuals and in response to injury, there is epithelial cell regeneration with  basal cell proliferation and subsequent differentiation to maintain the normal pseudostratified  epithelium. But as the clinical phenotype of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  progresses, the differentiation status of the airway epithelium begins to change as indicated by an  increased thickness of the epithelial layer, with proportionally more basal cells and less ciliated cells,  goblet cell hyperplasia, and eventually squamous metaplasia. In addition to the injury mediated by  cigarette smoke and inflammation, there is increasing evidence that the development of COPD is  associated with latent infection of the epithelium with adenoviruses. The focus of this project is on the  changes of gene expression in the airway epithelium that contribute to its altered differentiated state in  COPD. Our preliminary studies with gene expression microarrays combined with the developmental  biology literature have implicated the Notch signaling pathway as being critical to airway epithelial  differentiation. Notch is considered a primary gatekeeper against differentiation, with activation of the  Notch pathway blocking differentiation, whereas suppression of the pathway is associated with  allowing the cells to proceed toward a specific fate. Based on this background, the studies proposed in  this project are designed to test the hypothesis that COPD is associated with derangements of  the Notch signaling pathway in the airway epithelium, contributing to the abnormal pattern of  airway epithelial differentiation that characterizes this disorder. To test this hypothesis the  following specific aims are proposed. Specific aim 1. To evaluate the hypothesis that the Notch  signaling pathway is activated in the airway epithelium of individuals with COPD. Specific aim 2. To  examine the hypothesis that the airway epithelium cannot regenerate following injury in a normal  fashion in COPD, in part, because the normal pathways of the Notch signaling are disordered.  Specific aim 3. To test the hypothesis that group C adenovirus infection plays a role in the disordered  Notch signaling in the airway epithelium in COPD."

"9379783","Beige (or brite) adipocytes burn lipid by dissipating chemical energy to heat, and have been considered as a new therapeutic target to counteract obesity. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) were recently shown to be present in adipose tissue and play a critical role in regulating beige fat development by producing type 2 cytokine IL-5 and IL-13 and promoting IL-4/IL-13-driven type 2 immunity. Moreover, increased ILC2 response limits the development of obesity. However, the mechanisms underlying the recruitment and activation of adipose resident ILC2s remains largely unknown. Our preliminary studies identified adiponectin as a key regulator of ILC2. Concurrently, adiponectin suppresses ILC2s, as well as downstream events of ILC2s activation including IL-4 and IL-13 pathway, M2 macrophage activation and norepinephrine production in vivo and in vitro. In addition, adiponectin KO mice display increased basal, acute and chronic cold-induced energy expenditure as well as beigeing of white fat, which was suppressed by administration of the adiponectin receptor agonist adipoRon. These data suggest that adiponectin exerts anti-thermogenic function. Furthermore, absence of ILC2s diminishes adipoRon suppression of IL-4/13 pathway and UCP1 in vitro. Taken together, our data suggest that adiponectin inhibits the browning of white adipose tissue, and this effect is mediated by suppressing the function of ILC2s. We will first determine whether adiponectin suppresses the browning of WAT by inhibiting the ILC2-dependent IL-4/13 pathway. Next, we will characterize the molecular mechanism by which adiponectin regulates the function of ILC2s. This study will elucidate a novel role for adiponectin as a key regulator of ILC2s in adipose tissue. Elucidation of the underlying signaling mechanisms involved in the browning of white fat and interaction between adipocytes and adipose-resident ILC2s may reveal new promising anti-obesity drug targets and lead to novel therapeutic approaches for obesity-associated metabolic diseases."
"9320183","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): At the root of the hematopoietic system are long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs), an exceedingly rare population of multi-potent cells capable of self-renewal. Hematopoietic differentiation is accomplished through stably propagated changes to gene expression that are mediated by epigenetic factors, such as DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling, and the expression of microRNAs. Mutation and dysregulation of epigenetic effector genes, such as TET2 and DNMT3a, and aberrant microRNA expression have been implicated in hematological malignancies. Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is an incurable stem cell disorder that is characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and a risk of transformation to myeloid leukemia, and is frequently associated with abnormal DNA methylation. TET2, or tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2, oxidizes the repressive 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) mark to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC), the first step in removing DNA methylation. microRNA-22 (miR-22) is highly expressed in MDS and is associated with poor survival rates. In mice, miR-22 over-expression reduces global 5-hmC through repression of its target, Tet2, increases the self-renewal capacity of HSCs, and results in the development of an MDS-like disease. Using recent advances in the ability to profile genome-wide cytosine hydroxymethylation, we seek to identify specific targets of the miR-22/TET2 regulatory network in HSCs that contribute to the development of MDS. We also aim to describe miR-22's role as a mediator of normal hematopoiesis using a novel reporter of miR-22 expression. Finally, we aim to identify the potential for the inhibition of miR-22 in the treatment of MDS using recently acquired miR-22 knockout mice. The successful completion of this work will provide essential insights into the roles of microRNAs and epigenetic changes in the regulation of hematopoietic stem cell fate and the pathogenesis of hematological diseases, and may ultimately impact the treatment of poor-prognosis MDS."
"9326800","Project Summary Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a prevalent disorder with significant morbidity that has well-established adverse cardiovascular outcomes and increased mortality when left untreated. An emerging body of evidence suggests that untreated OSA may be associated with cancer but this association can be tested more rigorously in a large sample of OSA patients. We propose to test the association between OSA and cancer incidence and mortality in a cohort of over 1,000,000 veteran patients nationally through the Veteran's Affairs (VA) health system. We will carry out a retrospective cohort study of all VA patients with a diagnosis of OSA, as well as a control group of VA patients without OSA (>800,000) matched 4-to-1 for demographics, between 1991?2013 with up to 20 years of clinical follow up. We will further stratify patients based on those with untreated OSA (>200,000) and those that received treatment (>60,000) either with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy or surgery. We will measure cancer incidence and cancer-related mortality and test the association with the presence or absence of pre-existing OSA, controlling for cancer risk factors and comorbidities. We hypothesize that patients with pre-existing OSA will have a higher incidence of cancer and higher cancer-related mortality than patients without pre-existing OSA. We also hypothesize that patients undergoing treatment for OSA will have reduced cancer incidence and cancer-related mortality than patients with pre-existing, untreated OSA. Our goal is to develop a better understanding of the burden of untreated OSA on cancer and the long-term impact of OSA treatment on cancer outcomes."

Program graduates, including some that now serve as faculty on this award for which we seek renewal, have indeed attained independent academic positions and secured career development and research project grant funding to support their own programs of study."
"9335976","PROJECT SUMMARY In the long-term, our goal is to understand how single cells integrate and process information to make irreversible decisions such as whether to proliferate, differentiate or die. Inflammatory factors that participate in many normal and diseased cell fate decisions initiate signals by dynamically re-organizing proteins within the cell. For example, ligand-bound TNF receptors transiently organize large protein complexes near the plasma membrane, and these are visible within the cell as discrete punctate structures, whereas other proteins translocate between cellular compartments such as the cytoplasm and the nucleus. It is an emerging principle that dynamic properties of molecules within signal transduction circuits provide temporal codes (including rate of change, amplitude, duration or frequency among others) that are critical to each cell?s response to stimulus. Given that there is substantial cell-to-cell heterogeneity, even in clonal cell lines, static measurements at fixed time points cannot reveal the mechanisms of dynamic information processing. We hypothesize that components of the same signaling pathway are deterministically linked to one another in a single cell, even though there is substantial heterogeneity between cells. Here, we propose to multiplex expression of live-cell fluorescent reporters for up- and down-stream components of the same signaling pathway in the same cell, and correlate time-varying signals from live-cell microscopy data. Using a hybrid of quantitative imaging, microfluidics and computational techniques we will extract time-varying data from 100s-1000s of single cells in each experimental condition, and compare them across several different cell lines. We will also compare cellular responses across different inflammatory factors that share signaling modules and converge on the NF-?B transcriptional system, such as TNF, LPS or IL-1 among others. Using a rich single-cell dataset, we will use transfer entropy to measure mutual information between features of time-varying signals in the same pathway, and infer mechanisms of signal transduction in addition to correlations with cell fate. Data from live-cell experiments will be incorporated into mechanistic models to formalize our understanding of how information is relayed through the signaling network into transcription, and suggest perturbations to test predicted mechanisms. We anticipate that increasingly accurate models may lead to non-intuitive strategies to manipulate decisions in single cells. Through a detailed understanding of how dynamic molecular signals encode, process, and decode information, we have the potential to understand biological problems that are deeply rooted in disease, and use this knowledge to rationally design therapies that impact cell fate decisions."

We discovered that fungal galactofuranose?containing antigens are excreted in urine of infected animals and people, using a novel monoclonal antibody (mAb476). In a phase I STTR, we engineered a lateral flow device (LFD) called AspUTest, and performance was tested using urine samples obtained from patients with suspected and confirmed IA. Results showed >90% sensitivity and specificity, meeting predefined metrics for continued development. This Phase II application is designed to meet the following Specific Aims: 1.To optimize production of the AspUTest device; 2. To determine performance characteristics of AspUTest as an aid to diagnose invasive aspergillosis using batched samples obtained from patients with hematological malignancies; and 3. To validate and test the performance of AspUTest in clinical microbiology laboratories. Meeting these aims will enable submission for FDA clearance of AspUTest, marking an important advance towards decreasing IA morbidity with expanded availability of a low cost, easy to use urine diagnostic."
"9352387","Project Summary The presence of abnormal cell populations in patient samples is diagnostic for a variety of human diseases, especially leukemias and lymphomas. One of the main technologies used for cell-based diagnostic evaluation is flow cytometry, which employs fluorescent reagents to measure molecular characteristics of cell populations in complex mixtures. While cytometry evaluation is routinely used for the diagnosis of blood-borne malignancies, it could be more widely applied to the diagnosis of other diseases (e.g. asthma, allergy and autoimmunity) if it could be reproducibly used to interpret higher complexity staining panels and recognize more subtle cell population differences. Flow cytometry analysis is also widely used for single cell phenotyping in translational research studies to explore the mechanisms of normal and abnormal biological processes. More recently, the development of mass cytometry promises to further increase the application of single cell cytometry evaluation to understand a wide range of physiological, pathological and therapeutic processes. The current practice for cytometry data analysis relies on ?manual gating? of two-dimensional data plots to identify cell subsets in complex mixtures. However, this process is subjective, labor intensive, and irreproducible making it difficult to deploy in multicenter translational research studies or clinical trials where protocol standardization and harmonization are essential. The goal of this project is to develop, validate and disseminate a user-friendly infrastructure for the computational analysis of cytometry data for both diagnostic and discovery applications that could help overcome the current limitations of manual analysis and provide for more efficient, objective and accurate analysis, through the following aims: Specific Aim 1 ? Implement a novel computational infrastructure ? FlowGate ? for cytometry data analysis that includes visual analytics and machine learning; Specific Aim 2 ? Assess the utility of FlowGate for cell population characterization in mechanistic translational research studies (T1); Specific Aim 3 ? Assess the robustness and accuracy of FlowGate for clinical diagnostics in comparison with the current standard-of-care analysis of diagnostic cytometry data (T2); Specific Aim 4 ? Develop training and educational resources and conduct directed outreach activities to stimulate adoption and use of the resulting FlowGate cyberinfrastructure. The project will have a major impact in advancing translational science by overcoming key hurdles for adoption of these computational methods by facilitating analysis pipeline optimization, providing intuitive user interfacing, and delivering directed training activities. The application of the developed computational infrastructure for improved diagnostics of AML and CLL will contribute to the new emphasis on precision medicine by more precisely quantifying the patient-specific characteristics of neoplastic and normal reactive cell populations. Although FlowGate will be developed by the UC San Diego, UC Irvine, and Stanford CTSAs, the resulting computational infrastructure will be made freely available to the entire research community."

Strict maternal glycemic control is the key to optimizing infant outcomes. Medical treatment of overt T2DM in pregnancy is generally restricted to insulin as data on the safety and efficacy of oral hypoglycemic agents for overt T2DM is limited. However, over one-third infants born to women with overt T2DM experience an adverse outcome such as premature delivery, large-for-gestational age (LGA), hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, or birth trauma, suggesting that current treatment regimens fall short of optimizing outcomes. We believe that further research is needed to identify better strategies to reduce neonatal complications of overt T2DM in pregnancy. Metformin is the pharmacologic treatment of choice for overt T2DM outside of pregnancy. Metformin is favored over insulin because it results in less weight gain, fewer hypoglycemic episodes, and is oral rather than injectable. Metformin?s mechanism of action directly counteracts the insulin resistance characteristic of T2DM. Metformin is not recommended for treatment of T2DM complicating pregnancy, mainly because there are no large clinical studies examining its use in this context. Research is needed to address this knowledge gap. Our long-range goal is to optimize maternal and infant outcomes in overt T2DM complicating pregnancy. The objective of this proposal is to study the efficacy and safety of adjuvant metformin for treatment of T2DM among pregnant women receiving insulin therapy. Our central hypothesis is that compared to insulin alone, insulin plus metformin will result in improved neonatal outcomes. We will test this hypothesis byprospectively randomizing 1334 pregnant women with overt T2DM to insulin plus placebo therapy versus insulin plus metformin to accomplish the following specific aims: 1: To measure the effect of insulin/metformin on composite adverse neonatal outcome (perinatal mortality-miscarriage; stillbirth or neonatal death; preterm delivery, neonatal hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and/or birth trauma); infant birth weight and fat mass, among pregnant women with T2DM.; 2: To measure safety of insulin/metformin use among pregnant women with overt T2DM; and 3: To quantify gestational weight gain (GWG) and satisfaction with therapy among women treated with metformin. Successful completion of this proposal will result in high quality contemporary evidence for management of overt T2DM complicating pregnancy to improve neonatal outcomes."
"9357399","This project will place into the hands of many experimental neuroscientists validated, massively-multiplexed tools for recording of neuronal activity, for chemical sensing of neuromodulators, and for highly-patterned optogenetic stimulation with concurrent electrical recording ? in any region of the brain. This will be accomplished by making use of both PIs' decades-long working relationship with microchip foundries, to enable mass production of neural nanoprobes, of VLSI application-specific integrated circuits (?microchips?), and of supporting instrumentation for read-out and control. Our paramount objective in technology development is to optimize usefulness for end- users. We will achieve this by a highly-interactive program that: 1) solicits user needs; 2) assembles and validates neural nanoprobe systems in vivo; 3) deploys complete systems to neuroscientists; 4) provides technical support to enhance the end-users' success with the new neurotechnology; and, subsequently, 5) solicits feedback to enable the design of successive generations of neurotechnology. The technology to be produced and disseminated is based upon the PI's validated neural nanoprobes and advanced, custom microchips for their readout and control. Our existing 256-channel nanoprobe layers modules (assembled into 1,024 channel 3D arrays) and microchips were fabricated by the foundries that will be used in this effort. These systems have been validated in vivo. In Y1, nanoprobe layer modules will be fabricated with 1,024 channels, and will be stackable into composite 3D systems with 10,240 full time/full bandwidth channels. In Y2 nanoprobe layer modules with 8,192 channels will be mass produced; these will be stackable to configure dense, composite 3D systems with ~100,000 full time/full bandwidth channels. These first two production runs enable systems for electrophysiological stimulation, recording, and neurochemical sensing. A third production run will integrate optogenetic stimulation with proximal multisite electrophysiological recording. These hybrid nanoprobes will contain 512 e-pixels for optogenetic stimulation and 512 proximal recording electrodes. This new technology will have lasting impact by incorporating diverse needs of the community at the outset. Using these electrophysiological, neurochemical, and optogenetic probes, eight enthusiastic ?alpha adopters? will investigate cortical and subcortical circuitry underlying movement and mood disorders such as Parkinson's disease in rat models (Gradinaru Lab); the behavioral and computational roles of cortical layers and circuits in the mouse whisker system (Bruno Lab), visual systems in the mouse (Yuste Lab) and primates (Tolias Lab); speech representations in human patients (Yvert Lab); the role of sleep in memory consolidation (Laurent Lab); coupling between neuronal activity and energy supply (Magistretti Lab); and the thirst nucleus of the mouse hypothalamus (Oka Lab). These users will provide direct feedback to enable probe refinement early in the effort. Interested ?beta? end-users, beyond these alpha adopters, will be recruited through solicitations in our publications, postings on our website, short talks at neuroscience conferences and by directly contact."
"9251366","PROJECT ABSTRACT  The vastly diverse antigen receptor genes are assembled from numerous V, D and J coding segments via the lymphoid specific DNA rearrangement, V(D)J recombination. Defective V(D)J recombination impairs lymphocyte development and thus, results in immunodeficiency. The non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway is required during V(D)J recombination by virtue of its role as one of the major DNA double strand break (DSB) repair pathways. Mutations in nearly all of the NHEJ genes have been found in association with human primary immunodeficiency syndromes. ARTEMIS is the most frequently mutated NHEJ gene and was initially discovered in the radiation sensitive severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome, RS-SCID. NHEJ- deficient patients can undergo hematopoietic cell transplantation to reconstitute T and B cell functions. However, because NHEJ is critical for DSB repair in all cell types, conditioning regimens involving radiation cause excessive tissue damage and can lead to mortality. ARTEMIS-deficient patients have been successfully engrafted with T and B cells with myeloablative conditioning using alkylating agents. However, these patients exhibit late complications including growth failure, endocrine deficiencies and dental abnormalities. The goals of this proposal are to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the toxicities associated with myeloablative conditioning with alkylating agents using our previously developed and characterized mouse models of NHEJ- deficient SCID and to determine the efficacy of alternative conditioning regimens. The potential for late onset tumorigenesis associated will also be examined. Together, these studies will provide mechanistic insight into the causes of late toxicities in NHEJ-deficient primary immunodeficiencies and potentially lead to the development of more effective therapies."
"9245437","Project Summary/Abstract This proposal addresses a novel transcriptional mechanism of antiviral resistance to major human pathogenic viruses. We found that pharmacological suppression of bromodomain-containing BET proteins (BRD2, 3 and 4) by small-molecular weight BET inhibitor (I-BET) result in increased viral replication of human viruses such as Influenza A, Yellow Fever and Dengue Fever viruses in human cells. Most strikingly, the treatment of mice with I-BET in vivo enables the Dengue Fever virus to replicate in the non-permissive host. In extension of these studies, we found that much of the pro-viral effect of BET inhibition is likely to be attributed to the suppression of BRD3. The siRNA-mediated inactivation of individual BET proteins in cultured human cells shows the selective and highly potent role of BRD3, but not BRD4 or BRD2, in the suppression of virus replication in vitro. Our search for the cause of selective BRD3 involvement in antiviral response revealed a novel mechanism that may contribute to the selective targeting of BRD3 to type I interferon (IFN) stimulated genes (ISG), We found that viral infection or treatment of human cultured cells with IFN leads to BRD3 association with transcription factor IRF9, that plays an important role in ISG expression. We found that association with IRF9 depends on the C-terminal serine-rich micro-domain in BRD3 that becomes phosphorylated in IFN treated cells. Substitution of serine 443 (Ser443) that has been identified as the most abundant site for the BRD3 phosphorylation, abolishes interaction between BRD3 and IRF9 in the IFN-treated A549 cells. Collectively, our data suggest the mechanism where IFN-triggered phosphorylation of BRD3 contributes to its binding to IRF9 followed by BRD3 recruitment to ISGs and activation of the ISG expression. In this proposal, we will address the role of BRD3 phosphorylation in BRD3 targeting to antiviral gene loci and regulation of antiviral gene transcription. Using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated mutagenesis, we will test the functional significance of the BRD3-controlled RNAs, including enhancer and non-coding RNA, in regulation of viral infection. We will also test whether overexpression of the individual BRD3-controlled RNAs in BRD3- deficient cells can restore the impaired antiviral response. Collectively, our studies will describe a novel mechanism of the antiviral gene regulation and provide information about protein-coding as well as non-coding RNA that may play a key role in antiviral response. This information could be highly valuable for the development of novel antiviral therapeutic approaches as well as for the control of inflammation associated with increased production of pro-inflammatory antiviral mediators. This aspect of our work has significant health relevance, since it deals with the possibility of reducing the severity of virus-associated hyper- inflammatory syndromes."
"9390629","PROJECT SUMMARY Non-invasive stimulation of the cerebellum holds great promise for investigating brain function, and for diagnosing and treating a variety of brain disorders. Given the classical role of the cerebellum in motor control, it is not surprising that many studies have reported that cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation (CB- tDCS) can be used to enhance motor function and mitigate the symptoms of ataxia, dystonia and essential tremor. More recent studies have shown that CB-tDCS can modulate cognitive function as well, including working memory and emotional processing. Despite the great success that CB-tDCS has enjoyed in the last 15 years, we know very little about the way it works. The goal of this proposal is to fill this gap in knowledge by measuring for the first time the impact that CB-tDCS has on the activity of neurons in different regions of the brain. Mice will be used, and the polarity (anodal or cathodal) and the intensity of the stimulation will be systematically varied to determine the dose/response relationship between CB-tDCS and neural activity. To help translate the results to the human brain, the stimulation doses will be comparable to those that have been applied in clinical studies. In addition, the responses of neurons to CB-tDCS will be examined under different physiological states, including during rest as well as during sensory processing and motor performance. The experiments will take advantage of powerful genetic strategies to target specific neural populations, and to manipulate and record their activity with an unprecedented level of spatial and temporal resolution. The general plan is to start by assessing the local effects of CB-tDCS in the cerebellar cortex, and gradually move downstream, first to neurons in the deep cerebellar nucleus, and then to other regions of the brain that are connected to the cerebellum. The results of these experiments will provide critical information to help optimize the use of CB-tDCS for neuroscience research as well as for clinical application."
"9386466","Alcohol abuse can have devastating impacts on the brain and behavior and is a big burden on public health. However, the molecular underpinnings of alcohol induced neural cell injury are not fully understood. Recent advances in functional genomics suggest that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) may play critical roles in alcohol- induced neural cell death. The recent work from our laboratory support this hypothesis. Therefore, a comprehensive screening system of lncRNAs related to alcohol-induced neural cell death is of significant benefits for identifying potential therapeutic targets.  Genetic editing tools such as Zinc Finger Nuclease (ZFN) and Transcription Activation-Like Element Nuclease (TALEN) have great potential for the functional study of genes or the application of gene therapy through knockout or knockin techniques. A new type of genetic editing tool based on bacterial Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR?Associated System [Cas]) has been successfully used in various organisms from bacteria and yeast to mammals. Relative to ZFN and TALEN, CRISPR/Cas is advantageous because it only requires changing the sequence of the guide RNA (gRNA) and it can also be directly delivered into embryos to generate gene-modified organisms. Furthermore, the multiplexing capability of CRISPR/Cas makes it possible to target multiple genes simultaneously.  In this study we will use our recently developed dual guide CRISPR/Cas approach to generate an lncRNA knockout (gRNA) library in SH-SY5Y cell model. We will then perform a genome-wide screening for lncRNAs involved in alcohol-induced cell death pathways. Our preliminary data indicated that alcohol increased the expression of a nuclear paraspeckle lncRNA in SH-SY5Y cells. Our previous work have demonstrated that alcohol activates the oxidative stress-apoptotic cell death pathway in a dose dependent manner to reduce neuronal cell viability and increase cellular oxidative stress. We expect that the application of the high throughput screening platform in alcohol-induced neuronal death system will allow for the accurate identification of all other specific lncRNAs as well as their potential roles in mediating alcohol-induced neurodegeneration. The generated lncRNA gRNA library in this study can also be available for the characterization of cell toxicity induced by other neurotoxins or other substance abuse. Thus this research has a potential to reduce the health impacts of alcohol abuse and also has benefits for other substances abuse related public heath burdens."
"9256723","ABSTRACT  Cardiovascular diseases including aortic aneurysms are generally considered disease of the older population related to environmental factors and life style choices including smoking, and obesity caused by high fat and salt diets. However, 20 percent of individuals affected by thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissections (TAAD) have a heritable form, commonly attributed to mutations in genes that encode for extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and growth factors that contribute to vascular wall integrity. While there are a number of genes now identified as containing causal mutations for inherited forms of TAAD, causal genes in 75% of families with this disease have not been discovered. We recently identified a family with TAAD with unknown etiology. Through whole genome sequencing, we identified a missense mutation in the lysyl oxidase (LOX) gene (c.893T>G encoding p. Met298Arg) that segregated with the aneurysm phenotype in the family. LOX is an extracellular enzyme that catalyzes the amine oxidation reaction for critical crosslinking and maturation of elastin and collagen- key ECM proteins in the vessel wall.  To understand the mechanism underlying Lox-associated aneurysmal disease, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system to introduce the human mutation into mice (M298R in humans, M292R in mice). Characterization of the vascular system in mice carrying the M292R mutation confirmed that the mutation does indeed lead to aortic aneurysm formation. Animals homozygous for the M292R mutation died within a few hours of birth due to ruptured aortic aneurysm. Animals heterozygous for the mutation, however, did not develop aneurysms at 3 months of age, but had fragmented elastic fibers in the aorta wall, suggesting that the mutant animals may be predisposed to develop vascular disease when exposed of injurious stimuli. In this proposal, we will utilize this M292R mouse model to characterize mechanisms leading to changes in the arterial wall and determine whether additional vascular wall stress will induce thoracic aortic aneurysms. Furthermore, we will identify mechanisms underlying altered LOX function caused by the mutation that ultimately leads to aneurysm formation. Identification of Lox as a causal gene for familial TAAD will not only allow us to screen for Lox during clinical genetic testing, but understanding the mechanism behind how the mutation affects Lox enzyme function will provide insight into potential therapeutic development."
"9267109","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): UT-MSTAR program The University of Texas Medical Students Training in Aging Research Program (UT-MSTAR) is an experienced training program funded by the National Institute of Aging that seeks to educate medical students in pursuing research related to improving elders' care and to positively influence them to follow a career focused on serving older adults' health needs. Our well established program aims to continue, expand and evaluate an aging research program for medical students, featuring partnerships between the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UT Health Science Center), the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) and our newest partner, the University of Texas Southwestern (Dallas). The three UT scientific institutions provide exceptional environments and mentors to train medical students about the biology of aging, clinical geriatric syndromes and the conduct of gerontological research. The objectives of this proposal are to: 1) Inspire and nurture medical students to pursue basic science, translational or clinical research careers in aging; 2) Transform UT-MSTAR's current mentored summer research program in aging into a multi-site, multi-mentor, collaborative longitudinal early career development program for young scientists interested in gerontology and geriatrics; and, 3) Increase the numbers of physician-scientists engaged in aging research and academic activities, particularly those from Hispanic backgrounds (given our location and aging programs' foci). Aging researchers and faculty at UT Health Science Center have a 23-year history of successful programs in aging research for medical students. A T35 was successfully active from 1991- 1996; and subsequently in 2005, a partnership with the University of Pittsburg re-established the program. Since 2005, and most recently as a primary site in since 2010, the University of Texas Medical Student Training in Aging Research (UT-MSTAR) program has sponsored 107 medical students between San Antonio and Galveston. All MSTAR students completed mentored research projects; achieving 63 abstracts presented a national conferences such as the American Geriatrics Societ and 33 publications. Further, 11 Scholars remain in academic positions and 4 Scholars are or will be practicing geriatricians. UT-MSTAR Scholars highly appraised their experience, also improving their attitudes towards aging research, geriatrics and pursuing an academic career.  In applying for competitive renewal, the UT-MSTAR Program in Aging Research for Medical Students proposes to further develop and expand its size (47% increase with the addition of a new academic partner) to focus on diversity (older minorities' related research, minority students including early recruitment opportunities); unique research possibilities (Biology of aging and Hispanic geriatric cohorts) and additional students/mentors collaboration opportunities via proposed face-to-face Consortium meeting.        TRAINING IN THE RESPONSIBLE CONDUCT OF RESEARCH: Acceptable. The application describes reasonable plans for training in the responsible conduct of science and research ethics."
"9397734","Modified Project Summary/Abstract Section The main hypothesis of this competing renewal is based on new exciting data that further supports the pivotal role of the complement cascade (ComC) and other elements of innate immunity in the mobilization of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). The ComC is activated by the i) classical, ii) mannan-binding lectin (Mbl), and iii) alternative pathways, and, as we already reported, mice that lack the common distal component of the ComC (C5?/? mice), are poor mobilizers. To our surprise, however, we found that mice that do not activate the classical ComC (C1q?/? mice) are normal mobilizers. This ?discrepancy? is now explained by our latest results that show the pivotal involvement of the Mbl-dependent ComC pathway and not the classical pathway in mobilization. We also recently found that two stress-induced enzymes, heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS), are negative regulators of cell migration. Based on these findings, we have assembled a proposal that, in a comprehensive way, addresses the involvement of elements of innate immunity (ComC, Gr-1+ granulocytes/monocytes, naturally occurring antibodies) in the mobilization of HSPCs. In three interrelated specific aims, we address the crucial: i) inititation, ii) amplification, and execution phases of mobilization. Specific Aim 1. The initiation phase of mobilization is explained by Mbl-mediated ComC activation. We have maintained that the classical ComC activation pathway plays a crucial role in triggering mobilization. However, as we discovered recently, it is not the classical but the Mbl pathway that is crucial in this process. The main target cells for mobilizing agents are Gr-1+ cells, which, in addition to proteolytic and lipolytic enzymes, also secrete ROS and danger-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs). While proteolyic and lipolytic enzymes perturb the retention of HSPCs in bone marrow (BM) niches, ROS-exposed neoepitope antigens bound by naturally occurring IgM antibodies and DAMPs released from Gr-1+ cells are recognized by the circulating pattern recognition receptor (PRR) Mbl, which, via mannan-binding lectin serine proteases (MASPs), activates the ComC and coagulation cascade (CoaC). Specific Aim 2. The amplification phase of mobilization - the generation of C5 convertase. Since C5 cleavage is crucial for egress of HSPCs from BM, the main function of this phase is generation of C5 convertase activity. This enzyme is generated as a result of C3 cleavage, which provides elements of classical C5 convertase, and additionally by thrombin, which has C5 ?convertase-like? activity. The amplification phase is also modulated by a spontaneous amplification loop of C3 activation and by possible involvement of an alternative pathway of ComC activation and will be studied in detail in this aim. Specific Aim 3. Execution phase of ComC-mediated mobilization. Our recent results show that egress of HSPCs from BM is negatively controlled by HO-1 and iNOS, which are negative regulators of cell migration. We will focus on the molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon. It is expected that these results will be translated into the development of better mobilization protocols. 1"
"9354256","PROJECT SUMMARY ? PROJECT 3 The three major risk factors for Alzheimer's disease are age, female gender and ApoE4 genotype. AD can be divided into two groups by age at onset: early onset (onset < 65 years; EOAD) and late onset (onset > 65 years; LOAD). Human ApoE has three major isoforms: E2, E3, and E4. APOE4 is the strongest and most highly replicated genetic risk factor for late-onset AD (LOAD). One and two copies of APOE4 increase by a 3.7- and 12-fold AD risk and decrease the age of onset by 8 to 15 years relative to APOE3/3 carriers. Findings from the first four years of our program project indicate that the perimenopause transition leads to a bioenergetic crisis in rat brain which activates a cascade of adaptive responses associated with an Alzheimer's-like phenotype. To advance both mechanistic understanding and clinical translation, we focus the renewal of our program project on the hypothesis that ApoE4 positive females experience a triple hit: 1) ApoE4 genotype; 2) Aging and 3) Perimenopause. We propose that it is the perimenopausal bioenergetic shift in brain that creates greater risk of AD in women with a single copy of the APOE4 gene. The objective of this study is to 1) determine whether the perimenopausal transition in women is a transition state of risk for prodromal AD and 2) whether the ApoE4 genotype is a modifier that accelerates clinical indicators of risk of Alzheimer's disease that emerge during the perimenopause. Outcomes of these analyses will provide evidence regarding early stage development of three indicators of Alzheimer's risk, hypometabolism, brain atrophy and beta amyloid deposition. We have developed 3 approaches to test this hypothesis: a) a prospective molecular and neuroimaging study of 150 women; b) determination of the effect of the APOE4 genotype in 600 postmenopausal women on cognitive decline from the USC Atherosclerosis Research Unit, the Elite Trial; c) determination of the effect of the APOE4 genotype and menopause on the lifespan trajectories of approximately 5,000 women derived from 10,000 MRI derived brain volume metrics and clinical data available through the ENIGMA working groups. We will also analyze 33,195 subjects (men and women from ENIGMA) with MRIs and genomes for the effect of sex (males vs females), ApoE4 genotype using a meta-regression model. We hypothesize that females and ApoE (e2/e3/e4 allele) risk loading will also demonstrate accelerated hypometabolic phenotype and an earlier decrease in hippocampal volumes. This project is truly a multi- disciplinary effort bringing together a strong investigative team. Drs. Roberta Brinton (USC Schools of Pharmacy and Medicine), Meng Law (USC School of Medicine-Neuroradiology), Paul Thompson and Arthur Toga (USC School of Medicine-Institute of Neuroimaging and Informatics with the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging (LONI), Howard Hodis (USC School of Medicine), Wendy Mack (USC School of Medicine). Our collaborator Dr. Lisa Mosconi (New York University School of Medicine, NYU) has expertise in conducting brain imaging studies of subjects at risk for AD, including young to late-middle aged persons."

"9257897","Project Summary / Abstract Ortho-polychlorinated biphenyls (o-PCBs, non-dioxin-like PCBs) are abundant Superfund chemicals that have a broad range of adverse effects linked to developmental exposure in vertebrates, including altered cognitive and behavioral outcomes. The proposed studies will explore mechanisms of o-PCB effects in the biological model zebrafish (Danio rerio) and the ecological model Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus), to provide a mechanistic foundation for predicting and developing reliable markers of adverse outcomes linked to o-PCBs. O-PCBs are orders of magnitude more abundant than dioxin-like non-ortho substituted PCBs in the environment, in humans and in wildlife, increasing the concerns for significant health and ecological effects. PCB levels in killifish from the Superfund site in New Bedford Harbor, MA (NBH) are an extreme example, being as much as a thousand times greater than levels in other populations. Over generations of exposure, NBH killifish have become tolerant to dioxin-like PCBs, and our studies now suggest, to o-PCBs, as well. Our data show that the ortho-congener PCB153 causes large changes in gene expression in zebrafish and killifish larvae exposed as embryos, and in adult killifish brain, suggesting that there are heretofore unrecognized pathways and genes involved in genetic and behavioral responses to o-PCBs. We will examine response mechanisms in the brain and establish the contribution of nuclear receptor transcription factors and target genes to phenotypic and behavioral outcomes in exposed fish. Our recent data indicate that effects of different ortho-PCB congeners may involve a number of nuclear receptors. The o-PCB congener PCB153 misregulates large numbers of genes in various physiological pathways in developing zebrafish and killifish, and in adult killifish forebrain. We will expose adult and larval zebrafish and killifish from NBH and a reference site (Scorton Creek, MA) to o-PCB congeners, and use transcriptomics and proteomics to determine receptor-driven networks in brain. Interaction of o-PCB congeners with candidate zebrafish and killifish nuclear receptors, PXR (a major ?xenobiotic receptor?), PPARs, FXR, and LXR will be determined in vitro using reporter gene assays; in silico by modeling receptor proteins and docking o-PCBs; and in vivo using receptor knockout zebrafish generated by CRISPR-cas9 technology. The roles of receptors and target genes in behavioral outcomes will be examined using loss-of-function approaches in zebrafish and in killifish. Altered gene regulation and behavioral effects will be examined also in adults raised from exposed embryos, to determine whether early exposure produces lasting effects. Ecologically relevant effects may be enhanced or muted in response to chemical exposure in the New Bedford Harbor PCB-adapted fish population, or in other fishes exposed in the wild. The studies will provide new, fundamental information and tools important for risk assessment of established toxicants and related emerging chemicals of concern, which will facilitate ecologically relevant assessment of aquatic Superfund sites, including the success of remediation."
"8114832","Cardiac hypertrophy is the result of complex genetically predetermined electrical and mechanical remodeling  programs in response to mechanical and neurohumoral stimuli. Ca plays a pivotal role in the activation and  regulation of several hypertrophy transcription pathways, while Ca signaling itself undergoes profound  changes in hypertrophy (Hyp) and heart failure (HF), including significant contributions from InsP3-dependent  Ca release.  The specific aims of the proposed study are:  1) characterize the role of InsP3-dependent Ca signaling for excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) in  atrial and ventricular myocytes under physiological conditions and in Hyp/HF.  2) test the hypothesis that InsP3-dependent Ca release facilitates arrhythmogenic Ca signals (SR Ca  overload, Ca waves, Ca alternans, enhanced Ca spark frequency) and changes of membrane potential  (early (EAD) and delayed (DAD) afterdepolarizations, spontaneous action potentials (APs) and  electrical alternans) in Hyp/HF ventricular myocytes.  3) identify the cellular and subcellular Ca signaling pathways and spatio-temporal [Ca], patterns  relevant for nuclear Ca/calmodulin/calcineurin-dependent NFAT translocation which initiate gene  transcription and gene expression in cardiac Hyp and HF.  To achieve these aims a multitude of experimental techniques will be used: high resolution Ca imaging by  laser scanning confocal microscopy in single cardiac myocytes, novel FRET(CFP/YFP) fluorescent InsP3  sensors to study the cellular and subcellular dynamics of InsP3, whole-cell voltage clamp techniques to study  membrane currents and membrane potential changes, and molecular biological and pharmacological tools to  manipulate the InsP3/Ca/calmodulin/clacineurin/NFAT signaling cascade. Furthermore, several animal/cell  models will be used including wild-type mouse and rabbit, hypertrophy mouse, InsPa receptor knockout  mouse and heart failure rabbit.  The proposed research will generate fundamental new information on the roles of InsP3R-dependent Ca  signaling in cardiac myocytes during ECC, in arrhythmogenesis, electrophysiological changes and nuclear  transcription signaling in normal, Hyp and HF cardiac myocytes."
"9325531","Project Summary: The long-term goal of our laboratory's research is to develop treatments to prevent irreversible damage to podocytes in children and adults, that would otherwise lead to End Stage Kidney Disease (ESKD). At present, irreversible kidney damage leads to dialysis and transplantation, situations that carry with them considerable morbidity and mortality and cost the health care system well over 20 billion dollars annually. We hypothesize that disease progression in glomeruli involves long term changes in gene expression in podocytes. The Wilms' tumor-1 gene (WT1) encodes one of the major transcription factors that regulates gene expression in podocytes. Our recent studies demonstrate that WT1 is a master regulator of gene expression in podocytes and appears to regulate the expression most key genes required to maintain normal podocyte function. WT1 also appears to regulate expression of several of the other transcription factors important in podocytes. WT1 levels decrease in many forms of glomerular disease. In this grant we propose to determine why Wt1 expression decreases in injured podocytes and to define at a genome level how the set of WT1 target genes changes in injured podocytes. We have also determined that a second transcription factor, FoxC2, often acts together with WT1 to regulate expression of key podocyte genes. We will also use a genome-wide approach to determine the set of FoxC2 target genes in podocytes and how these change after injury. These studies will identify genes and signaling pathways in podocytes whose activity increases or decreases after injury, that may serve as targets for pharmacological intervention to prevent irreversible podocyte injury or death and consequent glomerular disease and ESKD."
"7700650","This project studies the molecular basis for actin cytoskeleton remodeling in vascular smooth muscle contraction. It complements the other projects of this grants that focus on tissues, cells and macromolecular assemblies. Two families of actin-binding proteins, Ena/VASP and WASP, have emerged as key regulators of cytoskeleton remodeling, playing distinct roles in filament nucleation and elongation, respectively. The molecular mechanisms controlling both processes remain a mystery. Ena/VASP and WASP are functionally distinct but share similar modular structures. They both contain poly-Pro regions that mediate the binding of profilin-actin, followed by G-actin binding domains of the WASP-Homology 2 (WH2) type. This project builds upon important preliminary results (presented here) and our recently determined structures of various WH2- actin complexes to propose the following two hypotheses: 1) Tandem WH2s line up actin subunits along a filament strand forming nuclei for actin assembly (nucleation step). 2) The poly-Pro-WH2 module contributes to filament elongation by processing profilin-actin complexes for their incorporation onto the barbed end of growing filaments (elongation step). To test these hypotheses, aims 1 and 2 will dissect the structure- function of the poly-Pro-WH2 and tandem-WH2 modules. We will determine the crystal structures of actin minifilaments assembled via tandem WH2 hybrid constructs and that of poly-Pro-WH2 bound to profilin-actin (transition state in elongation). Complementary solution studies will be carried out using analytical ultracentrifugation and SAXS/WAXS. A biophysical study of the various protein-protein interactions involved in nucleation and elongation will investigate the role of allosteric effects in these processes. Aim 3 studies the actin binding and scaffolding functions of alpha-actinin, a key adaptor protein of the spectrin family. Alpha-actinin mediates the interactions between integrins at the plasma membrane and the focal-adhesion proteins zyxin, vinculin, and paladin, which in turn recruit Ena/VASP to dense plaques. As a paradigm of these interactions, we will study the structural basis for the alpha-actinin-zyxin interaction. Using SAXS/WAXS, FRET and AU, we will test the two prevailing F-actin-binding models, compact and extended, for the actin-binding domain of members of the spectrin family. Understanding the molecular basis of vascular muscle contraction will accelerate the discovery of therapies to treat cardiovascular diseases."
"9369534","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Why do males and females behave differently in response to the same sensory cues? Behavioral sex- specificity is most evident in the displays of social behaviors by males and females in response to identical social cues. According to classical models of brain sex differentiation, molecular and architectural differences in brain circuitry are responsible for mediating sex differences in behavior. Alternatively, male and female brains may share a central circuit that is modulated differently. Strong support for this second model emerged from studies of Trpc2 knockout mice in which vomeronasal sensing is impaired, and from recent observations in various animal species including humans. In turn, these data raise the question - how does the brain generate behavior sex specificity? Moreover, little is known about how changes in circulating hormones and neural activity during puberty activate dormant neural circuits for sex specific behaviors ? a process likely to be associated with coordinated changes in synaptic strength and gene expression. I am developing a powerful new tool for studying in situ gene expression dynamics in genetically defined neural circuits. I will use this approach and test the hypothesis that gene expression programs during puberty act on similar circuits in males and females to determine the sex specificity of social behaviors. In preliminary experiments, I have genetically identified a subset of neurons in the mouse hypothalamus that gate behavioral sex-specificity. In the research proposed here, I will investigate the development and function of this neural circuit associated with behavioral sex-specificity by fulfilling the following aims: In Aim 1, I will establish the role of genetically identified neurons in the hypothalamus in gating behavioral sex-specificity using cre-dependent viral tools for cell ablation. Next, I will use a novel tool for cell type specific gene expression analysis to examine the molecular changes in these neurons over puberty. In Aim 2, I will use cre-dependent viral tools to trace the monosynaptic inputs and outputs of these neurons. Finally, in Aim 3, I will use whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology combined with optogenetics and gene expression analysis to examine input specific synaptic and molecular changes in these neurons that accompany the transition through puberty. The training phase of the award, conducted in the laboratories of Dr. Catherine Dulac and Dr. Venkatesh Murthy at Harvard University, outlines a comprehensive plan for the acquisition of technical and professional skills that will enable my transition to an independent research position. The successful completion of this project will provide a platform for future experiments aimed at understanding the development and architecture of neural circuits underlying social behaviors."
"9413791","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) are characterized by structural brain abnormalities and compromised cognitive and behavioral functions. Neuronal connectivity and plasticity are affected by developmental alcohol exposure. The exposure of astrocytes to ethanol inhibits neuritogenesis in hippocampal neurons co-cultured with ethanol-treated astrocytes. However, a lack of understanding of the mechanisms by which ethanol affects neuronal structural plasticity in the developing brain persists. Filling tis gap will open the path to the identification of highly effective treatments to prevent or ameliorat the developmental effects of ethanol. Lecticans are inhibitory proteoglycans that, in the brain, prevent the extension of axons and dendrites. Lecticans consist of a core-protein moiety covalently bound to linear chains of disaccharides, chondroitin sulfates glycosaminoglycans (CS-GAGs), which are comprised mostly of chondroitin-4 sulfate (C4S) and chondroitin-6 sulfate (C6S); the inhibitory properties of lecticans depend on their core-protein and their sGAG side-chains. Two sulfatase enzymes, arylsulfatase B (ARSB) and galactose-6-sulfatase (GALNS) remove sulfate groups from C4S and C6S respectively and are required for the degradation of CS-GAGs. We find that ethanol inhibits the activity of ARSB and GALNS and that ethanol and ARSB silencing increase the expression of the lectican neurocan and C4S-GAG content in astrocytes in vitro. ARSB activity is inhibited, neurocan and sGAG levels are upregulated, and pyramidal neuron dendritic arborization is reduced also in the hippocampus of neonatal rats after in vivo ethanol exposure. Reduced ARSB activity and dendritic arborization persist up to post-natal day 36 and is correlated with reduced performance in spatial learning and memory tasks. In this proposal we hypothesize that the inhibition of ARSB and GALNS activity by ethanol in the developing hippocampus induces an unscheduled increase in lectican (neurocan, brevican, and versican) core-protein and CS-GAG levels leading to decreased in neuronal structural plasticity; these effects are long-lasting and causally linked to reduced performance in learning and memory tasks and are rescued by recombinant (r)ARSB. We plan to test our hypothesis by pursuing the following three specific aims: 1) To investigate the mechanisms of ethanol-induced sulfatase inhibition and the consequences on lectican core-proteins and sGAG levels and on CS disaccharide levels and composition in astrocytes. 2) To investigate the role of: sulfatases, SUMF1, lecticans, and oxidative stress on ethanol-treated astrocyte inhibition of neurite outgrowth. 3) To investigate the effects of in vivo neonatal ethanol exposure and of rARSB injections on sulfatase activity, lectican expression, sGAG levels and CS disaccharide levels, and dendritic arborization in the hippocampus and on spatial learning and memory. The proposed work is innovative and significant as it explores a novel mechanism underlying ethanol-induced inhibition of neuronal plasticity and will yield strategies aimed at sulfatase enzyme activation for the treatment of alcohol teratogenesis therefore advancing FASD research."
"9321581","Abstract ACT of T cell receptor (TCR) gene- modified T cells specific to tumor antigens (Ags) is currently in clinical trials for patients with advanced malignancies. Transduction (Tdx) of human and murine T cells with our retroviral vector encoding the TIL 1383I TCR genes allows for recognition and killing of HLA-A2+, Tyrosinase (Tyr)+ melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Limitations to the efficacy of autologous ACT include: less potent activity of transferred cells in vivo, possibly due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment or to the altered biology of cells from a cancer patient. Another limitation is the monospecificity of the transferred cells, which could lead to immune escape variants; therefore, it is vital to build upon this therapy to achieve better and more durable clinical responses. Therapeutic efficacy of cancer vaccines has been shown to correlate with mounting a broad systemic anti-tumor response through induction of cross priming. A phase I clinical trial in collaboration with Dr. Keld Kaltoft, administered intratumoral injections of irradiated, allogeneic, MART-1-specific T cells into stage IV melanoma patients. Two of fifteen patients had regression of non-injected lesions and two patients developed vitiligo, suggesting induction of systemic anti-tumor immunity and generation of T cells specific to additional melanoma Ags. We propose to use intratumoral injection of Tyr TCR transduced (Td) allogeneic T cells as an alternate approach to systemic infusion of Tyr TCR Td autologous T cells to enhance host immune activation and overcome the immunosuppression that prevents destruction of tumors. We hypothesize that intratumoral injection of Tyr TCR Td allogeneic T cells will promote pro-inflammatory cytokine responses and lytic activity, leading to a favorable anti-tumor environment that facilitates epitope spreading and cross priming against additional melanoma Ags and results in regression of distant, untreated tumor lesions. In Aim II, to further enhance anti-tumor responses and elicit cross priming, we will genetically modify Tyr TCR Td T cells to overcome the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and to boost adaptive immune responses. By understanding mechanisms that maximize T cell function within the tumor microenvironment and generate systemic anti-tumor immunity, we can improve upon the therapeutic efficacy and safety of T cell-based immunotherapies."

"9389666","Project Summary The primary goal of this application is to elucidate the neural basis of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) signal using multi-modal approaches including multi-echo (ME)- rsfMRI, MR-compatible calcium signal recording, optogenetics and multi-laminar electrophysiology in awake rats. Despite the prominent role of rsfMRI in studying brain network function in health and disease, the neural basis of rsfMRI signal remains poorly understood. In particular, cellular and circuit-level mechanisms underlying resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) are unknown. This critical knowledge gap has hampered the interpretation of rsfMRI signal in light of underlying neuronal activity. Here, we propose an integrated strategy to mechanistically dissect the neural basis of RSFC by combining ME-rsfMRI, cell-type specific calcium-based fiber photometry, optogenetics and electrophysiology. Specifically, ME-rsfMRI can differentiate neural and non-neural components in rsfMRI signal. In Aim 1, we will apply ME-rsfMRI to obtain precise RSFC quantification by eliminating non-neural artifacts. Second, calcium-based fiber photometry is an optical method that directly measures spiking activity from a defined neuron population (e.g. excitatory neurons) based on a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GCaMP). Thus, combining calcium-based fiber photometry with rsfMRI offers simultaneous neuronal and rsfMRI signal measurement with neuron-type specificity. In Aim 2, we will use this technique to dissect the contributions of spiking activity from individual neuron populations to rsfMRI signal. This study will provide critical insight into the cellular mechanism underlying rsfMRI signal. We will also determine how cell-type specific calcium signals link to the local field potential and spiking activity measured by electrophysiology. In Aim 3, we will integrate optogenetics, rsfMRI and multi-laminar electrophysiology to determine the causal relationship between RSFC modulation and layer-specific neural activity change. We will modulate RSFC by optogenetically increasing neuronal excitability using Stabilized Step-Function Opsin (SSFO), and examine the resulting RSFC and layer-specific electrophysiology signal changes. Linking multi-laminar electrophysiology and rsfMRI data will bridge mesoscopic scale neuronal activity at each cortical layer and large- scale cortico-cortical connectivity. Therefore, this study will help reveal the circuit-level mechanism of RSFC. Critically, to avoid influences of anesthesia, all multi-modal data will be measured in awake rats, which also enables direct translation of our results to human rsfMRI studies. Together, the proposed research will provide critically needed knowledge that can bridge neuronal and hemodynamic activities at rest across wide spatiotemporal scales. Such knowledge so far is impossible to gain from human studies, but will directly impact our understanding of human rsfMRI research. Finally, given the high clinical relevance of rsfMRI, the proposed research will be an essential step toward our long-term goal of establishing rsfMRI as a noninvasive tool for aiding diagnosis and/or evaluating treatment options for brain disorders."
"9486448","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bacterial type I polyketide synthases (PKSs) are mega-enzyme assembly lines responsible for generating the macrolactone core of a wide range of polyketide products that are biologically active natural compounds (e.g. antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, anticancer, and immunosuppressant compounds). Indicative of their significance, polyketide natural products currently form the basis for nearly one-third of pharmaceuticals. PKSs employ a modular multi-step mechanism to produce polyketides, and bioengineering these systems has immense potential for the creation of new chemotypes with invaluable applications in drug discovery. However, such efforts have met with limited success, reflecting our poor structural and mechanistic understanding of the modular process to generate polyketides. We recently employed cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to show the first subnanometer resolution structures of the full length PikAIII module from the pikromycin PKS biosynthetic pathway, a prototype for assembly-line PKS systems. The findings not only revealed an unexpected module architecture undergoing extensive structural rearrangements, but also showed that the type of substrate linked to a highly mobile acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain specifies its positioning in a way that facilitates assembly-line throughput. By employing recent breakthroughs in cryo-EM technologies, we now aim to obtain high resolution cryo-EM structures of PikAIII and of the terminal PikAIV module, in an effort to resolve several lingering question regarding functional interfaces and module dynamics. Our studies will include both natural and unnatural substrates, seeking to reveal the principles of substrate recognition and processing in these remarkable macromolecular factories. The findings from the proposed studies will for the basis for renewed bioengineering efforts towards the creation of PKSs that can efficiently produce novel compounds of high medicinal value."
"9341396","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Perinatal hypoxia ischemia (H-I) brain damage is an important risk factor for acquired disabilities in children. Brain damage from H-I is a main cause of motor impairments such as those found in cerebral palsy and dystonia. The costs to society are huge, because of loss of potential productivity and the burden on the individual, family and social institutions, starting at birth and lasting an entire lifetime. Comparatively, CP has a highr index of burden of disease than many neurodegenerative diseases affecting the twilight years of life. There is a paucity of therapies available for fetal H-I. With the availability of a clinicall applicable animal model of cerebral palsy, innovative methods of investigating free radical damage and the integration of new non- invasive markers of injury a unique opportunity arises to systematically investigate the mechanisms of the developing fetal brain to H-I. Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an important cofactor in normal development of brain function. Deficiency of BH4 is also associated with development of motor disabilities. Our previous research has identified that motor deficits observed in the animal model is dependent on critical BH4 deficiency in different parts of the brain. Treatment of fetal brain with BH4 prior to H-I before birth significantly decreases motor deficits observed after birth. Thus we propose that development of motor deficits can be explained by a double-hit model, H-I in combination with developmentally low BH4. We hypothesize that the BH4 pathway in immature brain is selectively disrupted by hypoxia-ischemia injury leading to development of motor deficits. This hypothesis will be tested in fetal rabbits subjected to in utero H-I injury in the prenatal period. Using this model we will (1) elucidate if there is a threshold for BH4 concentration causing critical fetal brain injury; (2) investigate if the regional biosynthetic deficits of BH4 in neuron determines the development of motor deficits after H-I; (3) elucidate if BH4 treatment acts through a mechanism that involves oxidation- reduction. The influence of BH4 in the brain responses will be assessed by using state-of-the-art analytical methodologies to characterize BH4, and BH4 synthetic pathway changes in the immature brain. Additionally magnetic resonance imaging analysis will help in the identification of at-risk fetuses for neurobehavioral deficits. The successful completion of this work will hopefully bridge the gap in knowledge between the mechanisms of fetal brain injury and in broadening the potential application of BH4 therapies in the prevention and improvement of movement disorders in children."
"9316780","Prokaryotic DNA gyrase is a type II topoisomerase that can introduce negative supercoils to the DNA substrates with the hydrolysis of ATP. Because DNA gyrase only exists in bacterial cells and is an essential enzyme to bacteria, it is possible to identify inhibitors targeting DNA gyrase without affecting host human enzymes. Additionally, DNA gyrase can form covalent enzyme-DNA complex intermediates. This property makes gyrase an excellent bactericidal target for developing antibiotics. Indeed, fluoroquinolones are among the most successful antibiotics targeted to DNA gyrase. Unfortunately, bacterial resistance to fluoroquinolones has emerged and makes the development of new, more effective antibiotics an urgent issue especially for Gram-negative bacterial infections. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to discover and develop new and effective antibiotics that are capable of treating infections of antibiotic resistance bacteria. The objectives of this application are to develop novel biochemical and cell-based assays to screen antimicrobial compounds targeting bacterial DNA gyrase, and screen the NCATS compound library to identify novel DNA gyrase inhibitors. The biochemical primary assay stems from the synthesis of a type of unique fluorescence- labeled DNA molecules that can be used to study DNA topology and topoisomerases by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). The cellular assay is based on one recently constructed E. coli strain FL#1181 that contains a pair of divergently coupled PgyrA and PT7A1/O4 promoters controlling the luc and lacZ genes at the attTn7 site of the E. coli chromosome (84 min of the chromosome). Since transcription-coupled DNA supercoiling (TCDS) provided by a strong IPTG-inducible promoter, such as the T7A1/O4 promoter (PT7A1/O4), is capable of potently inhibiting the divergently coupled, supercoiling-sensitive gyrA promoter (PgyrA), our hypothesis is that DNA gyrase inhibitors should greatly ?enhance? the expression of the firefly luciferase under the control of the divergently coupled, supercoiling-sensitive PgyrA. As a result, the luminescence generated from the firefly luciferase will be significantly increased. This unique property of TCDS can be effectively used to screen and identify antimicrobial compounds targeting bacterial DNA gyrase. Three specific aims are: Aim 1. Develop a novel in vitro biochemical assay to screen inhibitors targeting bacterial DNA gyrase. Aim 2. Screen the NCATS compound collection to identify bacterial DNA gyrase inhibitors. Aim 3. Validate hits and identify DNA gyrase poisons using a newly developed cell-based method targeting TCDS. This truely interdisciplinary and collaborative effort brings two labs together (Leng and Smith labs) and offers a novel solution to address an urgent world health problem, antimicrobial resistance. !"
"9296288","Alcoholic liver disease (ALD), a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, includes a broad spectrum of disorders, ranging from simple steatosis to severe forms of liver injury such as steatohepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. Aside from the direct cytotoxic and the oxidative- stress?mediated effects that alcohol and its metabolites exert on hepatocytes, alcohol ingestion also activates both the innate and adaptive immune responses in the liver, and dysregulates several important signaling pathways in the liver, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of ALD. Recent studies suggest that impaired liver regeneration and inflammation are two important mechanisms contributing to liver failure in patients with alcoholic hepatitis. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The Hippo (Hpo) signaling pathway has recently emerged as a critical one regulating hepatocyte proliferation, survival as well as inflammation. Central to the Hpo pathway is the control of Yap/Taz transcription factors by a kinase cascade starting from the Hpo kinase, which are Mst1 and Mst2 in mammals. As hepatocyte injury is a major driving force for ALD pathogenesis, the goal of this explorative R21 proposal is to determine whether alcohol attenuates liver regeneration and induces liver inflammation by dysregulating the Hpo signaling pathway in hepatocytes. Despite the critical functions of Hpo signaling in restricting hepatocyte proliferation and survival we and others have identified, the precise functions and molecular mechanisms whereby the Hpo signaling pathway participates in alcohol-induced liver injury, inflammation and regeneration are mostly unknown. Hence, there are many unanswered fundamental questions regarding Hpo signaling in ALD. The knowledge gained from the proposed studies will establish a solid new foundation for further mechanistic investigation of Hpo signaling in ALD and provide new targets and strategies to protect liver from alcohol induced injury. Our unpublished preliminary data show that in a short-term chronic-binge ALD (E1d-1B) model, Mst1, Mst2 and Yap protein levels were reduced. We have also found that, infiltrated macrophage numbers and expression of pro- inflammatory cytokines are increased in the hepatocyte-specific Mst1 and Mst2 double mutant (DKO) liver. We hypothesize that reduction in Yap expression leads to increased hepatocyte cell death and impaired hepatocyte regeneration; while Mst1 and Mst2 down-regulation in hepatocytes of the alcoholic liver contributes to chronic pro-injury liver inflammation. In Specific Aim 1, we will define the effects of alcohol consumption on the Hpo signaling pathway in hepatocytes. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine whether alcohol feeding inhibits liver regeneration by reducing Yap in hepatocytes. In Specific Aim 3, we will determine whether alcohol feeding causes liver inflammation by reducing Mst1 and Mst2 in hepatocytes."

"9302624","The first round of funding was aimed at elucidating the role of H-Ras in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in  ethanol-mediated biochemical and behavioral neuroadaptations. We found that acute systemic  administration of ethanol, as well excessive consumption of ethanol, results in the activation of H-Ras in the  NAc of mice and rats, and that siRNA-mediated knockdown or pharmacologic inhibition of H-Ras in the NAc  leads to the attenuation of ethanol-drinking behaviors in rodents. We further showed that ethanol-mediated  activation of H-Ras leads to the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 pathway in the NAc. Importantly,  pharmacological inhibition of each of these kinases, including the FDA-approved mTORC1 inhibitor,  Rapamycin, resulted in the inhibition of excessive ethanol consumption and seeking. Based on these results,  we hypothesized that signaling pathways downstream of H-Ras in the NAc play a crucial role in the  molecular mechanism underlying ethanol-drinking behaviors. Here, we plan to test whether specific  pathways that stem from PI3K, AKT and mTORC1 are induced in the NAc of mice and rats in response to  repeated cycles of excessive ethanol consumption and withdrawal, and whether these contribute to the  development and/or maintenance of ethanol-drinking behaviors. Aim 1 will address the role of SGK1. In Aim  2, we will test the contribution of the transcription factor NFAc4, and the microtuble-associated protein  CRMP-2 in ethanol?s actions. In aim 3, we will identify mTORC1-dependent novel mRNAs whose translation  is induced by ethanol, resulting in increased levels of proteins that control synaptic functions. HRas/  PI3K/AKT and mTORC1 inhibitors are actively being developed by the pharmaceutical industry as  therapies against cancer and autoimmune diseases and as immunosuppressants. Therefore, we believe that  results obtained from these experiments could further lead to the identification and rapid development of new  medications to treat alcohol abuse disorders. Furthermore, the PI3K/AKTmTORC1 pathway is a focal point  in various signaling cascades to be investigated within the ACTG. We will, therefore, be able to integrate our  findings, share knowledge and reagents and easily collaborate on these projects."
"7700425","Despite the prominent role for tissue factor (TF)in various physiological processes, primarily in those related to blood coagulation, there is a lack of information with respect to the structure and function of natural TF forms existing in vivo. Most experimental data related to TF have been derived using various forms of recombinant proteins. Our preliminary data indicate that monocytic TF present on the native membrane is 150-400-fold more active than any TF, recombinant or natural, presented on an artificial membrane. The primary goal of this proposal is to study natural human TF from multiple sources by evaluating their structural and functional properties and by identifying the cell membrane component(s) responsible for high TF activity. Substantial amounts of placental, monocyte and mtcroparticle TF proteins will be purified by immunoaffinity methods. Characterization of purified TF species will utilize immunoassays, structural, biochemical and functional assays as well as structure-function analyses. Functional characterization of TF proteins both purified and presented on native membranes will include factor Vila-driven reactions in one enzyme-one substrate systems (fluorogenic assays, extrinsic factor Xase and factor IX activation) followed by more complex systems, such as TF-initiated thrombin generation in synthetic coagulation proteome and whole blood. The posttranslational modifications of the purified TF species will be characterized using deglycosylation, tryptic digestion, mass-spectroscopy and sequencing. The influence of these modifications on TF activity will be analyzed. Purified human TF from placenta will be used as a standard in all evaluations, functional and structural. Three different species of recombinant human TF will be used for comparison as well, i.e. TF^ea (full-length), TFi_242 (lacking the cytoplasmic domain), and TFi.2is (soluble; extracellular domain only). We will also attempt to understand the mechanism underlying high monocyte TF in situ activity by purifying, analyzing and evaluating the component(s) of the monocyte membrane, lipid rafts and monocyte-derived microparticles. The data accumulated during this study will expand our knowledge related to the structural and functional properties of natural human TF. New knowledge linking TF structure and environment with functional activity will be obtained. Relevance: This project will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms regulating the activity of tissue factor, a key protein in the initiation of blood clotting and an emerging link between inflammation and thrombosis."
"9353799","Project Summary Consumption of sugar sweetened beverages and juices (SSB/J) in infancy is associated with obesity in early childhood. This is a significant public health issue requiring family based solutions. Yet interventions aimed at SSB/J reduction remain controversial based on limited effects in prior studies and concerns whether targeting a single factor will have an impact on the multi-factorial problem of obesity. However, while a prior trial in obese teenagers showed no effect of SSB/J reduction in Caucasians, there was a large significant effect in Hispanics. Furthermore, no study has examined the effects of SSB/J reduction during infancy when consumption begins and adipose tissue is rapidly developing. We therefore propose a trial aimed at reducing SSB/J consumption in low-income, Hispanic post-partum mothers and infants, a segment of the population at high risk for obesity. Although maternal-infant interventions are needed, they present many challenges including compliance and retention. We propose an innovative solution that merges components of effective interventions for SSB/J reduction and maternal-infant nutrition, into an existing home visit program (HVP), which are federally supported nationwide for promoting child development in high-risk populations. The 24-month intervention will focus on replacing mothers? intake of SSB/J with water, and delaying introduction and limiting access to SSB/J in infants using home visits, telephone calls and in one group, home delivery of water/non-caloric beverages. Hispanic mothers who were overweight/obese prior to pregnancy (n=240) will be randomized with their newborn infants to one of three groups. Group 1 (efficacy) will receive a modified HVP incorporating a focus on SSB/J reduction plus home delivery. Group 2 (translation) will be identical to Group 1 without home delivery. Group 3 (control) will receive standard of care HVP. The main outcome will be body fat by DEXA in mothers and infants. Aim 1 tests whether the intervention will reduce obesity and metabolic risk in post-partum mothers. Aim 2 tests whether the intervention reduces the trajectory for body fat and weight-for-length in infants. We will also examine if these effects are maintained without home delivery, thus supporting scalability of the intervention approach. Aim 3 tests whether the effects on infants are mediated via maternal transmission related to changes in maternal sweet taste preference, use of SSB/J to sooth infants, use of sugary foods during weaning, and the profile of sugars in breast milk. In summary, this trial will generate empirical evidence to support a scalable, public health, life-course strategy for addressing obesity in Hispanic mothers and infants."
"9353882","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite significant advances in the treatment of patients harboring GBM, there have been modest increases in overall survivals, on the order of 1 month for every decade of research. While the EORTC-NCIC trial by Hegi et al (13) implicated the status of MGMT promoter methylation as a biomarker of GBM patient response to Temozolomide (TMZ), all GBM patients continue to be treated with TMZ, regardless of their MGMT status (13). The lack of enthusiasm to systematically use MGMT promoter methylation to guide treatment is due to: 1) lack of other therapeutic options; 2) 50% of patients with methylated MGMT promoter (a good prognostic factor) do not survive 2 years; and, 3) 15% of patients with unmethylated MGMT promoter (bad prognosis) survived 2 years. Moreover, MGMT methylation status is associated with improved outcome both in the TMZ-based chemoradiation and radiation-only arms. All of these observations suggest that MGMT promoter methylation status may be partly a prognostic marker associated with the nature of the tumor, rather than a truly therapy- specific predictive marker. Cytochrome c Oxidase (CcO) is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in cellular ATP generation. We previously demonstrated that CcO plays a central role in acquired resistance to TMZ. Importantly, in a retrospective trial, we showed that CcO activity was inversely correlated with clinical outcomes. The long term goal is to identify robust and clinically relevant molecular markers that can add value to classical clinicl prognostic factors in order to tailor medical treatment to individual tumor characteristics and to design better clinical trials for new drugs against gliomas. The objective of the proposed biomarker clinical trial is to determine whether CcO activity represents a novel and valuable prognostic biomarker for patients receiving standard of care therapy. Our hypothesis is that high tumor CcO activity is associated with poor outcomes independently of MGMT promoter methylation status. Additionally, we hypothesize that MGMT promoter methylation status is a true predictive biomarker of how patients will respond to standard of care TMZ-based chemoradiation in tumors with low CcO activity. This will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) determine overall and progression-free survival times relative to CcO activity; 2) compare the prognostic value of CcO activity to other commonly used prognostic markers. The approaches are innovative because we will validate activity of a mitochondrial enzyme, CcO, as a strong prognostic biomarker for primary GBM. Moreover, clinical trial designs based on CcO activity and MGMT promoter methylation stratification have tremendous potential to optimize and individualize therapy by prospectively identifying those patients who will benefit most from TMZ standard therapy and those who will not. This proposed research is significant because it is expected to vertically advance and expand the application of new prognostic and predictive biomarkers for GBM patients in order to tailor medical treatment based on individual tumor characteristics and to design better clinical trials for new drugs leading to personalized therapy for GBM patients."

Our project includes developing smartphone and tablet (mobile) applications for Suffolk County's English, Spanish and Chinese online food manager courses and for Suffolk County's active managerial control program. We will also develop and implement classroom and on-site training courses to support Suffolk County's active managerial control program. The infrastructure of Suffolk County's Food Protection Program will be improved by providing thermometers, flashlights, tablets and other equipment used to conduct inspections, a professional grade printer for printing materials in support of Suffolk's training courses, and the installation of demonstration hand washing sinks in our training classroom. Increased conformance with the national standards will contribute to a decrease in risk factors that contribute to food borne illness, reduced rates of foodborne illness at our regulated food service establishments and contribute to a nationally integrated food safety system."
"9358149","PROJECT SUMMARY We propose to introduce early stage medical students to the challenges and excitement of research by providing a mentored summer research experience with the ultimate goal of inspiring trainees toward academic careers that incorporate basic biomedical and clinical research. The T35 Research Training in Immunology and Infectious Diseases (REIID) program will exist as a dedicated, NIAID-focused research and career development program that leverages the successful administrative framework of the Student Training In Approaches to Research (STAR) Program at Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine. The T35- REIID program will provide students between their first and second year of medical school with a focused eight-week mentored training experience pursuing NIAID-related research resulting in completion of a research project and formal presentation of their work. The Stritch School of Medicine is a rich academic environment and a leading institution in immunology and infectious disease-related research and clinical care. We have assembled a team of twenty-four experienced, extramurally funded mentors whose research covers epidemiology; genetics; molecular, cellular and pathophysiological mechanisms of disease; translational research; and patient-oriented clinical research. The student?s full-time research training will be supplemented with didactic conferences on topics including experimental design, data management, responsible conduct of research, professional development, and presentation skills. Trainees will be chosen through a competitive process based on their proposed research plan and goals for the summer experience. The T35-REIID program includes student and mentor assessments to evaluate the quality of the research experience and didactic offerings as well as our success at encouraging students to pursue academic careers that include research."
"9321023","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How does stress affect health behaviors - preferences, beliefs, or constraints? The goal of this proposal is to identify a behavioral mechanism which might cause low adherence to medical regimens and other health behaviors. Low adherence is frequently associated with high levels of stress. Stress may affect adherence by increasing temporal discounting, i.e. a person's preferences for immediate relative to delayed outcomes; by decreasing self-efficacy, i.e. a person's beliefs about what they can achieve; or by impairing executive function, i.e. cognitive and behavioral constraints such as attention and working memory. In Specific Aim 1, we identify appropriate measures for these targets. In Study 1A, we conduct a systematic literature review to identify measures; in Study 1B, we carefully test the psychometric properties of these measures. In Specific Aim 2, we assess whether stress affects our targets through a laboratory experiment in which participants are exposed to mild stressors. We hypothesize that stress will increase temporal discounting, decrease self-efficacy, and impair executive control. In Specific Aim 3, we identify and develop interventions to engage our targets of interest. In Study 3A, we identify candidate interventions, or develop new ones, that may affect our targets. Interventions are likely to include videos to raise aspirations, writing exercises for self-affirmation, computer games to increase the salience of future outcomes. We then test whether these interventions engage our targets using a laboratory study in which participants are first exposed to the interventions and then tested on the target measures. We hypothesize that the interventions will reduce discounting, increase self-efficacy, and improve executive control. Finally, in Specific Aim 4, we test whether engaging our targets improves medical regimen adherence using a field experiment in which randomly selected households will be exposed to one of our interventions. Our primary adherence behavior of interest is attendance of antenatal and postnatal care (ANC/PNC) visits by expecting and new mothers. We hypothesize that exposure to the interventions will engage our targets of interest and increase ANC/PNC adherence. Preliminary work: During SOBC-1, we have already tested the effect of stress on temporal discounting, and the effect of simple psychological interventions on psychological well-being; thus, the studies described above are a natural extension of our work in this area. Together, these proposed studies will contribute to establishing a more mechanistic understanding of the origin and failure of health behaviors such as medical regimen adherence."
"9306012","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The sense of light touch is critically important for daily life but this important sense can be altered to result in sensory dysfunctions such as tactile anesthesia and mechanical allodynia under pathological conditions. How mammals can sense light touch has been one of the biggest mysteries in science. This lack of knowledge prevents development of potentially effective approaches for preventing or treating mechanical sensory dysfunctions. Our long-term-goal is to uncover the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the sense of light touch in mammals. As the first stage of our long-term goal, the overall objective of this application is to study mechanisms underlying mechanical transduction of Merkel cell-neurite complex, a sensory structure essential for sensing light touch in mammals. Our central hypothesis is that Merkel cells are mechanical transducer cells that express mechanically activated ion channels (MA) and that activation of these channels triggers Merkel cells to fire action potentials and release excitatory transmitters. This hypothesis is based on ou preliminary results obtained by using our recently developed patch-clamp recordings from Merkel cells situated in whisker hair follicles (Merkel cell in situ patch-clamp technique). This innovative technique has, for the first time, led us to successfully record MA currents from Merkel cells. We have further discovered that Merkel cells in situ fire action potentials in response to mechanical stimulation. Our unique expertise of Merkel cell in situ patch-clamp recording technique places us at an advanced position to test the hypothesis with the following specific aims: 1) Elucidate ionic mechanisms of MA currents that excite Merkel cells in situ and characterize Merkel cell MA channel properties; 2) Identity ion channels that encode mechanical activity in Merkel cells; and 3) Delineate the mechanisms underlying the transmission of mechanical activity by Merkel cells. The outcomes of the above investigations will provide scientific knowledge about the sense of light touch at a cellular and molecular level. The study may have clinical implications ranging from sensory dysfunctions seen in diabetes and other disease conditions to Merkel cell malfunctions such as Merkel cell carcinoma."
"9296179","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary/Abstract Title: Metabolic drivers and sensors of cell proliferation in pulmonary hypertension Key Words: Pulmonary hypertension, glucose metabolism, O-GlcNAc, cell proliferation K99 pathway to R00 independence: The applicant took a unique opportunity to join the Cleveland Clinic Pathobiology Department for his postdoctoral training to gain experience in human translational research. The K99 application will combine his pre-doc expertise in basic research and his post-doc translational/clinical research to create an independent, translational career. By the end of the 2 year K99 portion of the award, he will have established an animal model for pulmonary hypertension, acquired the necessary skills to interrogate this model for the 3-year R00 transition, and link this it to his continued study of human clinical research.  Research Plan: Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) is a progressive disease that leads to deterioration in cardiopulmonary function and premature death. Presently, IPAH is considered a vasculopathy, and metabolic dysregulation, including dysregulated glucose metabolism, has emerged as a major area of research in the pathobiology of the disease. Several processes may be governed by the metabolic dysfunction present in IPAH, including enhanced pulmonary vascular cell proliferation, vascular remodeling, and vasoconstriction. Thus, there is a clear need for more effective therapies that target the underlying disease processes in IPAH. We recently published that increased O-linked N-acetyl-glucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT) activity was shown to enhance pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation and worsen IPAH disease outcomes. OGT is a molecular stress `sensor' and is responsible for the O-GlcNAc modification of proteins that are involved in cell signaling, cell cycle, proliferation, and nutrient metabolism. Proper homeostasis of the OGT/O-GlcNAc axis is required for cell viability and regulation. When elevated and sustained, the OGT/O-GlcNAc axis is a `driver' of disease pathology through the marked regulation of fundamental processes, including cell proliferation and nutrient metabolism. On the other hand, instant and temporary homeostatic changes within the OGT/O-GlcNAc axis can protect cells from the onset of oxidative stress, hypoxia, trauma hemorrhage, and ischemia/reperfusion injury. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that HBP flux and the OGT/O-GlcNAc axis is fundamental to protect the lung vasculature in the early progression of IPAH, while excessive and sustained levels lead to the `end-stage' of the disease. Using a combination of models ranging from human cell culture to animal models, we will test our hypothesis by investigating the following specific aims: AIM 1 (K99; human clinical training and transition): Determine the mechanism(s) whereby the OGT/O-GlcNAc axis regulates glucose utilization and metabolism in IPAH. AIM 2 (K99, R00): Investigate the specific molecular regulator(s) of the OGT/O-GlcNAc axis in the pathogenesis of IPAH and a hypoxia/sugen mouse model. AIM 3 (R00, independence): Determine the role of the increased OGT/O-GlcNAc axis in the early progression of PAH using a hypoxia/sugen mouse model. The proposed K99/R00 application is innovative because it: (i) utilizes didactic training leveraged through the interaction between the Programs of Excellence in Glycoscience (PEG) sites (Cleveland Clinic and Johns Hopkins University) as well as other significant sites (New York University and University of Illinois-Chicago); (ii) evokes translational research from both human IPAH samples and hypoxia/sugen mouse models to determine the molecular regulators that contribute to the imbalance of the OGT/O-GlcNAc axis and its impact on aberrant glucose metabolism and cell proliferation in IPAH; and (iii) launches long-term, core collaborations between the PI, established scientists in the field of glycobiology, and clinicians/scientists in pulmonary vascular disease. The project will identify the sensors and drivers of the glucose metabolism and cell proliferation, improve our understating of IPAH pathogenesis and progression, and offer new insights into the pathobiology of IPAH to ultimately improve patient functional capacity, quality of life, and long-term survival."
"8112388","Numerous studies examining atherosclerotic lesions from human and animal models have  established the central role of the macrophage in atherosclerosis. Despite these observations, it is still  unclear how the multiple pro- and anti-inflammatory capabilities of the macrophage are balanced within  lesions. One potentially important mechanism for them to regulate their function is by the rapid modulation of  the repertoire of proteins expressed on their cell surface through proteolytic shedding. In addition to  dynamically altering the cell surface constituents, shedding also leads to the release of soluble ectodomains  with distinct biological properties. This proposal will focus on the ADAM family of proteases that have gained  recognition as primary effectors of ectodomain shedding.  Early lesions of atherosclerosis are characterized by lipid-filled macrophages. Scavenger receptors  are responsible for this massive accumulation of cholesterol, and their significance for atherogenesis is  highlighted by multiple gene knockout studies. Fas ligand (FasL) is a key cell surface regulator of  macrophage apoptosis and activation. Both scavenger receptors and FasL can be proteolytically cleaved  from the cell surface resulting in down-regulated cellular expression. The release of soluble scavenger  receptor can inhibit foam cell formation in vitro and in vivo, while FasL is proteolytically released in both  active and inactive forms. Thus, proteolytic shedding of scavenger receptors and FasL could modulate  lesion initiation and progression. However, the enzymes responsible for their shedding have not been fully  characterized. In Aim 1, we will determine the proteases involved in the shedding of scavenger receptors  and FasL, and the functional significance of shedding on atherogenesis will be examined in Aim 4 by  expressing uncleavable mutants of these substrates.  In addition to possible effects on lesion initiation, ectodomain shedding may also contribute to lesion  progression and plaque rupture. Macrophage activation induces the shedding a multitude of inflammatory  mediators, and ADAM17 has been shown to be responsible for the shedding of several of these. In Aim 4,  we will test the role of ADAM17 in lesion initiation, progression and plaque rupture by genetically modulating  its expression in macrophages. In addition, proteomic approaches will be utilized to identify novel substrates  for ADAM17 potentially involved in atherosclerosis (Aim 2), and to determine the role played by oxidants in  regulating the activity of this enzyme (Aim 3) in collaboration with Project 4."

This application's activities will build and embed mechanisms that combine local expertise and insight with research capabilities, benefitting all participants through information sharing and capacity building. This program can serve as a model for partnered research in other priority areas, leveraging and enhancing existing activities and relationships between CHOP and community agencies."
"9272878","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes, a major risk factor for development of periodontal disease, has increased in prevalence by 400% since 1980. Of the 25 million diabetic patients in the United States, it is estimated that 7.5 million have severe periodontitis. It is generally accepted that the severity of periodontal disease is correlated with the presence of inflammation. However, inflammation fails to completely explain the rapid progression of periodontal disease, generalized skeletal bone loss, and marrow fat accumulation that can be observed in young insulin-dependent diabetics with low plaque levels and good oral hygiene. Therefore, it is likely that other mechanisms are mediating the coupling of bone loss and diabetes. Since 1967 it has been repeatedly noted that clinical neuropathy is correlated with both the prevalence and severity of periodontal disease in diabetic patients. The skeleton and periodontal complex are highly innervated and local changes in nerve function have the capacity to regulate both the bone microenvironment and the overlying inflammatory response. However, despite significant correlative evidence linking neuropathy and periodontal disease in diabetes, the ability of local neuropathic change to contribute to bone loss, marrow fat accumulation and periodontal disease development in diabetes remains unexplored. Our central hypothesis is that in diabetes, sensory denervation and depletion of sensory neuropeptides in the skeleton enhances vasoconstriction and accumulation of marrow fat while limiting bone regeneration. These changes would predispose diabetic patients to development of osteopenia and progression of periodontal disease. If targeted neural dysfunction is identified as an underlying cause of bone loss and periodontal disease, treatment and prevention strategies will have the potential for significant evolution. We will test our hypothesis in rodent models of streptozotocin induced insulin-dependent diabetes with or without chemical, physical or transgenic inhibition of neural signaling. When this work is completed we expect to identify neural regulators of skeletal metabolism and determine the in vivo relevance of these findings to progression of diabetes-associated bone loss and periodontal disease. These outcomes are expected to have a broad positive impact because neural regulation of the skeleton is relevant to other conditions associated with bone loss and marrow fat accumulation including osteoporosis, aging, gonadal dysfunction and anorexia."
"8112389","Osteopontin (OPN) is a multifunctional, secreted phosphoprotein with beneficial anticalcific effects  on pathological calcification. Recent data suggest that OPN may also play a critical role in  development of various chronic inflammatory diseases, including atherosclerosis. Furthermore,  growing evidence indicates that multiple, proteolytically processed forms of OPN are generated  under inflammatory conditions. However, virtually nothing is known about the specific form(s) and  function(s) of OPN important in these settings. We propose that a common feature of chronic  inflammatory conditions is a requirement for OPN function in macrophages. Specifically, we  hypothesize that 1) OPN mediates macrophage recruitment, activation, and survival in  atherosclerotic plaques, 2) thrombin, as well as matrix metalloproteases secreted by inflammatory  cells modify OPN activity, and 3) that specific OPN proteolytic fragments are required for plaque  progression in vivo. Three Specific Aims are proposed to address these hypotheses. In Specific  Aim 1, the role of macrophage- and lymphocyte-derived OPN in atherosclerotic lesion initiation and  progression in chow-fed ApoE-/- mice will be determined using bone marrow transplant studies. In  Specific Aim 2, the role of OPN and its receptors in the modulation of macrophage functions in vitro,  including adhesion, migration, survival and activation, will be examined. Finally, in Specific Aim 3,  the role of two integrin binding domains, RGD and SLAYGLR domains, of OPN as well as MMPderived  OPN proteolytic fragments will be determined during atherosclerotic lesion development  and progression in ApoE-/- mice using bone marrow over-expressing these OPN fragments on a  macrophage specific promoter. Understanding differences in the mechanisms and  structure/function relationships governing inflammatory properties of OPN could help create specific  therapeutics targeting these distinct functions."
"9390626","This project will develop transcranial magnetic stimulation coils with improved focality and depth (fdTMS). TMS is a technique for noninvasive brain stimulation using strong, brief magnetic pulses. TMS is widely used in the neurosciences as a tool for probing brain function and connectivity. Presently, TMS is FDA-approved for the treatment of depression and for pre-surgical cortical mapping, and is under study for other psychiatric and neurological disorders. A significant limitation of TMS, however, is that the induced electric field stimulates a relatively large area of cortex, especially when the targets are deep. Low focality entails co-activation outside the desired target, which reduces the precision of stimulation, may increase the risk of side-effects including seizures, and may reduce efficacy via antagonistic responses. Thus, fdTMS coil technology could enable more selective, safe, and effective stimulation.  Conventional TMS coil design has relied on simple heuristics to determine the shape of the coil windings. Because the winding shape is related in a complex way to the electric field induced in the brain, the spatial stimulation characteristics of available coils are generally suboptimal. Consequently, while coils intended specifically for deep TMS have been commercialized, their tradeoff between depth and focality is not better than that of conventional figure-8 and double-cone configurations. Addressing this limitation, we propose to develop fdTMS coils to obtain maximal focality for a given depth of stimulation or specific anatomical target. Unlike conventional approaches, our method specifies the required electric field characteristics in the brain and deploys novel computational optimization algorithms to determine the coil winding shape and placement to meet these specifications within practical energy limits. We present preliminary data demonstrating that for any target depth our approach outperforms existing coils with increase in focality up to 100%.  Using this approach, we will design, implement, and validate two types of fdTMS coils. First, we will develop a series of general-purpose coil designs corresponding to a range of practical depths. The coils will be optimized for maximal focality in a spherical head model, reflecting the intended use for various targets and therefore being anatomy-independent. Like most conventional coils, they will be freely moveable on the head surface. Second, we will optimize coils for specific anatomical brain targets using state-of-the-art MRI-based head models. This approach accounts for the effects on the induced electric field of anatomical features such as gyral shape and current flow through the highly conducting sulci. We will validate experimentally the fdTMS coils via measurements of induced electric field maps as well as human motor responses. The human study will quantify stimulation focality and depth through mapping of muscle representations at various locations and depths in the primary motor cortex using electromyography."

"9380081","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Total Knee Replacement (TKR) is the most successful intervention to address pain from knee osteoarthritis. However, most resume a sedentary lifestyle gain weight and subsequently remain at high risk for poor health outcomes after surgery. There is a critical need for people after TKR to adopt an active lifestyle. Outpatient Physical therapy (PT) is an ideal, low-cost setting for a physical activity intervention for people after TKR given that physical therapists are experts at prescribing and personalizing exercises to meet patients' abilities over multiple outpatient visits. Unfortunately, little study has been devoted to the efficacy of a physical therapist delivered physical activity intervention. The objective of this proposal, which builds on significant preliminary data, is to evaluate the preliminary efficacy over 3 months of a physical therapist-delivered physical activity intervention. The intervention starts with providing a Fitbit? monitor at admission to PT. Next, the physical therapist provides face-to-face feedback on current activity levels and recommends step goals personalized to previous activity levels, a process that takes < 5 minutes at each visit. The intervention is integrated into standardized outpatient PT for TKR. Our team's long-term research goal is to test the efficacy of this innovative intervention in a future multi- center clinical trial."
"9335458","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) occurs only in vulnerable individuals after exposure to severe traumatic events. This risk is due, in part, to 40-70% heritability of differential vulnerability or resilience. In fact, recent studies have suggeste that the heritability for PTSD may be twice that of Major Depressive Disorder. Due to increasing collaborations across the field of PTSD genomics, it is a very exciting time for discovering the underlying genetic risk factors contributing to PTSD. The purpose of this application is to facilitate meta- analyses of genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for symptoms and diagnosis of PTSD.  We propose to conduct this first large-scale meta-analysis through the PTSD group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC). The PGC was created in 2007 to conduct field-wide mega-analyses of individual data for five major psychiatric disorders. It united the field for the first time, and it is the largest consortium (>500 scientists from >80 institutios in 25 countries) in the history of psychiatry. The PGC has already produced three major findings with regard to the genetic architecture of psychiatric disorders. First, reliable associations can be identified with extremely large sample sizes. A meta-analysis of GWAS in SCZ has produced over 100 loci at the genome-wide significance threshold in a sample of 36,000 cases and 43,000 controls. Second, the polygenic architecture inferred from family studies was confirmed with molecular evidence, and refined via demonstration of substantial effects of both common and rare variants. Third, confirming findings from twin studies, there are shared genetic contributions among psychiatric disorders. The PGC-PTSD group was launched in May 2013 and since then has been enormously successful, with over 25 investigators contributing genotype data from over 20 studies with a total N of over 76,000 combined cases and trauma-exposed controls. We also have commitments of collaborations using ~ 77,000 additional cases and controls from banked samples from over 20 studies, and our progress thus far demonstrates feasibility of the proposed work.  We hypothesize that with well-powered, large sample-size studies, along with a deeply phenotyped set of cohorts, the PGC-PTSD group can identify the genetic architecture of PTSD. We will test this hypothesis through our Primary Aim focusing on detecting novel genetic variation associated with risk for PTSD. The primary aim of this study is to detect novel genetic variants (SNPs and CNVs) that predict the development of PTSD following trauma. We will conduct the study in three stages - discovery, biological annotation, and replication. This aim will be supplemented by Exploratory Aims which will expand the genomic approaches to include GxE analyses, meta-analyses of intermediate phenotypes, and cross disorder polygenic risk score analyses. Identifying the genetic pathways underlying PTSD will lead to an improved neurobiological understanding, enhanced prevention, and improved treatment of this debilitating and prevalent syndrome."
"9340067","Abstract: Age related hearing loss (ARHL) has a major impact on quality of life of more than 70% of those over the age of 70. It is a growing problem with significant socioeconomic ramifications. The cause of ARHL is complex and likely involves both environmental and genetic factors. Symptoms associated with ARHL, specifically, the initial loss of ability to discriminate sound in a noisy environment that progress to high frequency loss that can further progress to lower frequencies over time, suggest a common vulnerability that is independent of the initial trigger. We are postulating that common to ARHL is an initial loss of hair cell afferent fiber synapses. Much as with noise induced hearing loss, we hypothesize a selective loss of high threshold fibers. We will test these hypotheses using multiple genetic mouse models of ARHL. Each will be monitored using whole animal auditory testing including auditory brainstem responses and distortion product otoacoustic emissions to document the time course of onset of ARHL in each model. Specific Aim 2 will evaluate synaptic maintenance and proteins associated with pre and postsynaptic elements to further characterize the temporal windows associated with hearing loss. Specific Aim 3 will use electrophysiological and optical technologies to measure synaptic vesicle release and trafficking, monitor calcium homeostasis and record postsynaptic properties synaptic potentials as well as electrical properties. Each aim is well integrated with the goals and techniques available from each of the other investigators on this proposal and together we shall identify a global framework in which to address this important translational problem."
"9354255","PROJECT SUMMARY ? PROJECT 2 The goal of our Program Project is to discover the biological transformations that occur in the brain during the perimenopausal transition that can result in phenotypes predictive of risk for development of AD pathology. Our focus is on the primary genetic risk factor for late-onset AD, the ?4 allele of apolipoprotein E (ApoE4), and how it is disproportionally affects AD risk in women. In particular, we will investigate interactions between several significant risk factors for AD: age, the ApoE4, and female sex. In Project 2, our specific emphasis is how ApoE4 interacts with female sex, perimenopause and adiposity to cooperatively drive development of AD pathology. Perimenopause initiates the age-related depletion of ovarian hormones in women. Perimenopause is also linked with increases in body weight and adiposity that often lead to obesity, an established risk factor for the development of AD. Significantly, adiposity and obesity are not only regulated by ovarian hormones, but also are known to impair bioenergetics and increase inflammation. Thus, perimenopause creates a dangerous convergence of AD risk factors in middle-aged women that we hypothesize is exacerbated by ApoE4. We hypothesize that the central unifying link between AD, ApoE, obesity and estrogen is inflammation. Pro- inflammatory pathways can function as critical driving forces in AD pathogenesis, are elevated by both ApoE4 genotype and obesity, and are inhibited by estrogen. To investigate these relationships, we propose three specific aims that are highly collaborative across all Cores and Projects. Specific Aim 1: ApoE genotype interactions in the regulation of inflammation and Alzheimer's pathways. We will compare the effects of ApoE alleles on expression of AD- and inflammation-related genes, AD neuropathology, metabolism, and cognition Specific Aim 2: Obesity and ApoE genotype interactions with female sex in the regulation of inflammation and Alzheimer's pathways. We will determine how ApoE status interacts with obesity in the regulation of AD- and inflammation-related pathways, AD neuropathology, metabolism and cognition. Specific Aim 3: Hormone interventions for protection against inflammation and Alzheimer's pathways associated with ApoE genotype, obesity and perimenopause. We will evaluate the efficacy of estrogen-based hormone therapies in attenuating the effects of ApoE4, in the presence and absence of obesity, during both perimenopause and late menopause."
"9374247","DESCRIPTION There is a fundamental gap in understanding the lack of complete benefit after in-utero spina bifida repair where fewer than half of the patients show improvement in spinal cord function. The long-term goal of this project is to incrementally improve the neurological outcomes of affected children through the regenerative repair of the defect site. The overall objective of this application is to determine whether the use of cryopreserved human umbilical cord (HUC) for in-utero spina bifida repair reduces inflammation and scar formation at the repair site, and thus improves neurological outcomes in a sheep model. The central hypothesis is that HUC compared to conventionally used methods improves the function of the spinal cord at and below the defect site and reduces the surgical sequelae of scar formation in a surgical spina bifida model in a pregnant sheep. This hypothesis has been formulated by preliminary data produced in the applicant?s laboratory. HUC is FDA approved for ophthalmological diseases and has an active component, heavy chain hyaluronic acid/pentraxin3, which demonstrates anti-inflammatory and anti-scarring properties. The rationale for the proposed research is that exploration of the properties of HUC as a regenerative patch in in-utero spina bifida repair has the potential to immediately translate into humans to improve outcomes in spina bifida, which affects over 4000 live births annually in the United States. The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two Specific Aims in a sheep model: 1) Compare histological, radiological and clinical outcomes of in-utero repair using HUC vs. acellular dermal matrix (ADM) based patch repair for the skin closure in large spina bifida defects, and 2) Compare similar outcomes using HUC as a dural patch under the primary skin closure vs. multilayered closure. Using the established surgical spina-bifida model in pregnant sheep that generated our preliminary data, Specific Aim 1 seeks to quantitatively assess inflammation, scar formation using histology and advanced magnetic resonance imaging, and neurological outcomes using the validated Texas Spinal Cord Injury Scale and bladder control in lambs repaired with HUC compared to ADM. In Specific Aim 2, dural substitute with a HUC placed between the skin closure and neural placode or conventional multilayered closure will be used in the same model as above, and assessments will be performed similarly to Aim 1. The approach is innovative, as it departs from the status quo by utilizing the naturally occurring regenerative properties of HUC to improve healing of in-utero spina bifida repair to reduce long-term neurological sequelae. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to vertically advance and expand the benefits of in-utero repair of spina bifida including facilitating the minimally invasive repair to reduce maternal risks associated with the large uterine incision needed for the current approach. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to find newer approaches to the treatment of other congenital anatomical birth defects such as cleft lip/palate, gastroschisis, and diaphragmatic hernia."
"9333852","ABSTRACT Liver fibrosis is linked to inflammation and deregulated wound healing response, triggered by chronic exposure to various types of insults including alcohol, obesity, NASH and viral hepatitis. Recently emerging liver therapies directed to eliminate the pathogenic agent suggest promise in resolving fibrosis. However, to design anti-fibrotic therapeutic strategies we need a better understanding of the pathogenesis of fibrosis. Accumulation of extracellular matrix is the hallmark of hepatic fibrosis. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are activated by pro-fibrogenic stimuli and are the main ECM producing cells in the liver. The role of oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines in HSC activation has been under extensive investigation. Targeting stress pathways to inactivate HSCs is an attractive therapeutic strategy and crucial to effective treatment.  Stress induced transcription factor and master regulator of proteotoxic responses, HSF1 mediates induction of HSP90 and HSP70, stress chaperones important in inflammatory signaling and likely to play a role in HSC activation and reversion, respectively. Our preliminary data show that deficiency of HSF1, unable to induce HSP70 promotes HSC activation and fibrosis and moreover, is unable to resolve HSC activation and fibrosis in a model of fibrosis recovery. Increased cytosolic HSP90AA1 and endoplasmic reticulum (ER), HSP90B1/Grp94/gp96 in fibrotic livers may contribute to fibrogenesis. Targeting HSP90, using a specific inhibitor, 17-DMAG, which induces HSF1 activation and downstream HSP70, will delineate the role of HSF1-HSP70 in inactivation of hepatic stellate cells. We hypothesize that HSF1 inactivity and HSP90 induction during stellate cell activation contributes to liver fibrosis, whereas induction of HSF1 and HSPA1A/HSP70 contributes to resolution of fibrosis. The Specific Aims are- 1) To unravel the role of stress mediated transcription factor, HSF1 on regulation of liver fibrosis by: Examining the effect of stellate cell specific knock-out of HSF1 on fibrogenesis; Testing effect of HSF1-plasmid nanoparticles on fibrosis resolution; Evaluating longitudinal expression, activity and novel target genes regulated by HSF1 during fibrosis and resolution. 2) To assess whether targeting HSP90AA1 (cytosolic) and/or HSP90B1/Grp94/gp96(ER) regulates stellate cell activation and fibrogenesis by: Evaluating the induction of HSP90AA1 and gp96 during stellate cell activation; Investigating effect of hsp90 inhibitor, 17-DMAG on liver fibrosis; Determining effect of stellate cell-specific inhibition of gp96 and HSP90 in vivo, on hepatic fibrosis. 3) To investigate importance of HSF1 induced HSP70 in stellate cell function by: Determining induction of Hsp70 and its dependence on HSF1, during resolution of fibrosis; Investigating whether overexpression of HSP70 inactivates HSC and resolves fibrosis; Evaluating HSF1-HSP70 axis during 17-DMAG treatment on HSC activation and fibrosis. Our proposed studies will unravel the role of HSF1 mediated stress pathways and chaperones in stellate cell activation and fibrosis."
"9390663","Abstract Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is an important modality for imaging the human brain. Capturing fluctuations in the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal while the brain is `at rest', rs- fMRI can detect distant, and often bilaterally-symmetric regions where activity is synchronized. Such regions are inferred to have `functional connectivity', and patterns of these networks have been found to be altered in a wide range of otherwise indistinguishable disease states. However, despite widespread use of rs-fMRI, interpretation of functional connectivity networks is limited by: 1) The dependence of fMRI BOLD signals on hemodynamic changes as a proxy for neural activity and: 2) A limited understanding of the mechanistic basis of functional connectivity networks in the context of cellular-level interactions and neural representations.  In a recently published study, we demonstrated a new optical imaging technique capable of capturing both neural activity and hemodynamics across the bilaterally exposed superficial cortex of awake, behaving mice. This method revealed striking patterns of resting-state neural activity in the awake brain, exhibiting bilateral symmetry and features consistent with resting-state networks. Moreover, we demonstrated that this `neural network activity' was predictive of patterns of resting-state hemodynamics (via a linear convolution model), suggesting that we were visualizing the neural basis of resting state functional connectivity mapping.  In the current proposal, we plan to leverage this new view of neural network activity in the brain, to characterize its cellular dependencies, pathways, drivers, behavioral correlates and interactions with hemodynamics. Data will be acquired using novel measurement and circuit manipulation techniques in awake, behaving mice, in addition to analysis of human rs-fMRI, intracranial and intraoperative electrophysiology in patients undergoing epilepsy evaluation (data from ongoing trials) as well as new intraoperative simultaneous optical hemodynamic and electrocorticography recordings. A major aspect of this project will be the aggregation of this data to generate predictive mechanistic and mathematical models of 1) Neural network activity and its dynamic properties and representations across scales and modalities and 2) The coupling relationships between resting-state activity in specific cell types and hemodynamics. These models will be used to derive and test improved methods for rs-fMRI acquisition, analysis and interpretation. To perform this work, we have assembled a world-class interdisciplinary team consisting of neuroscientists, neuroengineers, neurosurgeons, statisticians and experts in resting state fMRI acquisition and analysis. With a sharper understanding of the properties of neural network activity, its dependencies, and how best to harness it in human rs-fMRI, the results of this work could ultimately provide a mechanistic basis for network dysfunctions and their cognitive and behavioral manifestations in disease, potentially yielding new targets for therapies and more robust rs-fMRI based disease detection."
"9293906","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Data suggest that patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV) experience chronic lung inflammation, rapid lung function decline, and an increased risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Although potent combination antiretroviral treatment (ART) appears to reduce lung inflammation, the effects of ART on the rate of lung function decline and other important clinical outcomes remain unknown. This study is designed to address this knowledge gap, while providing a better understanding of the mechanisms for the rapid lung function decline observed in patients with HIV infection. This study has randomized 1,026 participants from 80 sites and 20 countries in a Pulmonary Substudy within a large, international, randomized, controlled trial - the Strategic Timing of AntiRetroviral Treatment (START) trial-and the study plans to follow these participants until unblinding in December 2016. The parent START trial has randomized 4,688 HIV-infected persons who were naïve to antiretroviral treatment, with a CD4+ count >500 cells/mm3. Participants were randomized to either immediate initiation of potent ART or deferral of ART until the CD4+ count declines to <350 cells/mm3. Participants in the Pulmonary Substudy were enrolled prior to randomization, thus permitting an appropriately controlled experimental comparison of the effects of immediate vs. deferred ART treatment on pulmonary outcomes. START is the only ongoing multi-site randomized study comparing immediate vs. deferred ART, and the Pulmonary Substudy is among the few (and the largest) randomized intervention trials underway focused on HIV-associated lung disease. The extensive biological specimen repository, including genetic data and other data collected as part of the parent START protocol, will provide opportunities for multiple future investigations of biomarkers, genomics, metabolomics and other mechanistic work directed at understanding the development of COPD in patients infected with HIV. This study will advance understanding of the pathogenesis of rapid lung function decline and subsequent COPD in the presence of HIV infection."
"9288197","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A majority of children who recover from surgery suffer from pain in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and upon arriving home. Poorly treated postoperative pain is detrimental due to impacts on children's postoperative behavioral and clinical recovery and subsequent pain and medical care. Accordingly, it is important to develop methods that will alleviate child pain in the postoperative environment. In a previously funded NICHD grant, specific nurse and parent behaviors that influence children's postoperative pain were identified. Building on this line of research, the overall goal of this F31 application is to develop and test the Nurse and Parent Training in Postoperative Stress (N/P-TIPS). The first goal of this study is to develop an intervention which will include a training program to teach PACU nurses to increase behaviors that alleviate child pain and decrease behaviors that elicit child pain and teach nurses how to train parents to alter their own behaviors in a similar way. The second aim of this study is to conduct a formative evaluation to examine the feasibility and acceptability of this newly developed intervention in a busy surgery center. We will revise the intervention based on healthcare provider feedback. The third objective of this study is to conduct some preliminary testing of the intervention's ability to change parent and nurse behaviors leading to decreases in child postoperative pain. This application will subsequently lead to a large-scale, randomized controlled trial of the effectiveness of the newly developed intervention (R01 NIH application)."

This group includes members from the Duke CFAR Cores as well as the Duke Center for the Study of Aging,  the Divisions of Geriatrics and Infectious Diseases, and other diverse members from Duke's medical and  scientific community. There are 3 specific aims of this SWG: 1) to identify ongoing research projects at Duke  related to the study of aging and HIV/AIDS and support collaborations among these groups; 2) to promote new  scientific research and investigators in the field of HIV and aging at Duke; and 3) to foster national, inter-CFAR  and cross-institutional collaborations in HIV and aging research."
"8114778","It is becoming increasingly evident that calcium influx in vascular smooth muscle is a strong modulator of  smooth muscle (SM) gene regulation and phenotype via activation of calcium-dependent transcription  factors. We provide evidence that L-type calcium influx is necessary for the constitutive expression of  smooth muscle-specific differentiation markers (SMX: e.g. SMMHC, SMaA) and that exercise can increase  L-type calcium channel function in coronary smooth muscle (CSM). The general aim of this proposal is to  determine the mechanism(s) by which exercise training limits CSM phenotype switching during  atherosclerosis. The overall hypothesis is that calcium influx via L-type, voltage-gated calcium channels (L-VGCC)  stabilizes CSM in a differentiated, contractile phenotype. Conversely, dedifferentiation and  proliferation are stimulated by upregulation of intermediate-conductance K channels (IK) and store-operated  calcium channels (SOC). Exercise training prevents CSM phenotypic switching by maintaining L-VGCC  activity and subsequent SM-specific, calcium-dependent gene expression. The Specific Aims are:1)  Determine the effect of atherosclerosis on CSM ion channel functional expression, 2) Determine the effect of  atherosclerosis on intracellular calicum regulation by membrane potential, 3) Determine the effect of L-type  VGCC- versus IK/SOC-mediated calcium influx on calcium-dependent transcription factors and SMX and 4)  Determine whether exercise training can prevent the loss of L-type VGCC-mediated SMX. Early and  advanced models of atherosclerosis will be produced in swine by dietary high-fat, high-cholesterol (HFC) or  balloon injury. Both in vitro and in vivo measures of CSM phenotype will be determined using molecular,  cellular and in vivo coronary angiography techniques. The proposed research will provide the first  mechanistic link between coronary ion channel activity and CSM phenotype switching. Furthermore, it will  provide the first mechanistic examination of the role of CSM in the cardioprotective effect of exercise."

"8106514","The Administrative Core coordinates the fiscal, scientific, and administrative aspects of the Program Project Grant. Although Drs. Goldstein and Brown share the overall administrative responsibility for this grant, their administrative duties are divided. Dr. Goldstein is in charge of budgetary and personnel matters. Dr. Brown is in charge of purchasing equipment and supervision of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Drs. Goldstein and Brown are assisted by their Financial Affairs Manager, Ms. Kay Pokladnik. Ms. Pokladnik is assisted in her duties by a Laboratory Manager, Scott Clark. In addition to their administrative responsibilities, Ms. Pokladnik and her staff are also responsible for the typing and preparation of all our manuscripts, grant applications, and research progress reports. Ms. Jeri Rogers and Ms. Mary Hestand, Administrative Manager and Senior Administrative Associate, respectively, for the Department of Molecular Genetics, draw their salaries from the Department, and not from the Program Project Grant. Nevertheless, they are available to provide back-up support to Ms. Pokladnik and her staff during vacation periods, sick leave, and busy work days. On the basis of experience gained during the past 29 years of operation of this Program Project, we have found that the most efficient and inexpensive way to administer the financial aspects of this Project is to maintain one formal account that is divided into the categories used by the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. These categories consist of salaries, maintenance and operation, equipment, and travel. In the past we have had extreme difficulty in trying to maintain nine separate accounts (one for each of the six Research Projects and one for each of the three Core Units). The advantages of one account versus nine accounts are several-fold: First, with one account all financial records can be kept by one person, Ms. Pokladnik. If we were to administer nine accounts for Years 31 to 35, this would require that a new Administrative Assistant be hired. Second, with one account we can purchase in bulk various items that are used in all six Research Projects and in the three Cores (such as 32P-nucleotides, 3H-sterols, chromatography supplies, transfection reagents (Fugene 6), gloves, micropipettes, etc.), and thus reduce costs considerably. Third, with one account Ms. Pokladnik can prepare a weekly summary of expenditures for review by Dr. Goldstein. This weekly review has proved extremely helpful in preventing duplications in expenditures for frequently purchased items. Although only one formal account will be kept, the overall allocation of funds to the individual Research Projects and Core Units will be made along the budgetary lines suggested by the NHLBI Council. Should a reallocation of funds between Research Projects or Core Laboratories become necessary, this matter will be handled by the Executive Committee as discussed in the PROGRAM INTRODUCTION. The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas maintains an accounting office that keeps a monthly record of all expenditures by budget category and makes certain that only allowable items are purchased and that monies are spent appropriately. The University conducts periodic internal audits that examine expenditures of grant funds as well as other matters. Our last Departmental audit was conducted in April, 2005, and no financial irregularities were found."

"9301635","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Mucus forms an essential barrier that protects the lungs from inhaled particles, pathogens, and chemicals. These toxicants are entrapped in mucus, then swept out of the lungs by ciliary action. Paradoxically however, mucus dysfunction contributes to the pathobiology of all of the common diseases of the airways, including asthma, cystic fibrosis, and COPD, as well as interstitial lung diseases. Mucin glycoproteins are the principal macromolecular component of mucus, responsible for its structure as a semi-solid gel by binding more than 100-fold their mass of water. Mucins are secreted both at a low basal rate and a high stimulated rate. A common feature of airway mucus dysfunction is the rapid secretion of overproduced mucins into the airway lumen, forming mucus that is excessively viscoelastic and cannot be cleared by ciliary action. This impedes airflow and provides a protected environment for microbial growth. While the control of mucin production and hydration have been studied intensively, the mechanism of secretion is incompletely understood. Exocytosis in all eukaryotes is mediated by the cooperative interactions of a SNARE complex and an SM scaffolding protein, which are the core exocytic machinery. Our studies show that for some components of this machinery, different isoforms function in basal versus stimulated mucin secretion. Our central hypothesis is that the differential roles of certain exocytic proteins in basal and stimulated mucin secretion allows their manipulation to augment basal secretion and inhibit stimulated secretion, attenuating the pathophysiology of mucus hypersecretion without impairing toxicant clearance. Aim 1. Determine the identity and function of the SM protein that mediates basal mucin secretion (we have already determined the identity of the SM protein in stimulated mucin secretion). Aim 2. Determine the identity and function of the Syntaxins (key components of SNARE complexes) that mediate basal and stimulated mucin secretion. Aim 3. Augment basal and inhibit stimulated mucin secretion to improve lung pathophysiology in mouse models of asthma-like airway obstruction and microbial infection. Completion of these aims will provide fundamental understanding of the mucin secretory mechanism, and build on that knowledge to test translational strategies to mitigate mucus dysfunction while preserving protective benefits of the mucus barrier."
"9212002","T cells play a critical role in the host response to Mtb infection, and are their antigen specificity forms the  basis of widely used clinical immunodiagnostic tests. MHC-restricted effector memory T cells protect the host  from progression to active TB disease, but the particular effector functions, which mediate control are  unknown. In a well characterized human patient cohort in Lima, Peru, we will determine the association of  active TB disease with 400 transcripts measured in highly purified effector memory T cells. Transcripts  associated with lack of disease progression will be validated by PCR and protein measurements to define  gene products that can be measured as surrogates for protection from TB progression and targets for  immunotherapy development. Nearly all current technology development efforts related to adjuvant  formulation, vaccine design and immunodiagnosis focus on MHC antigen presenting molecules. However,  recent studies show that non-classical CDIb and MRI proteins present mycobacterial lipids and metabolites  to T cells in TB disease. Emphasizing new ex vivo methods and CD1 tetramers, we will measure the  relationship of expansion of lipid- and metabolite-specific GEM T cells and MAIT cells during human and  guinea pig infection and relapse. In particular, we propose to (a) measure GEM T cell expansion ex vivo  during acute human tuberculosis infection (b) comparative nanostring profiling of effector functions of MAIT  cells and GEM T cells, and (c) detect CDIb-restricted T cells in guinea pigs using CDIb tetramers. These  translational studies seek to establish the first tractable small animal model of in vivo CDIb function and  detect a causal relationship of infection with invariant T cell activation. Bypassing the genetic complexities of  human MHC proteins, activation of invariant T cells by lipids and metabolites offers potentially more uniform  outcomes that could be detected or modulated with lipids and vitamin metabolites (Project 4)."
"9485511","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The shortage of organs for kidney transplantation for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is magnified in Hispanics/Latin Americans. Hispanics have a disproportionately higher prevalence of ESRD, yet receive fewer kidney transplants compared to non-Hispanic whites. Living donor kidney transplant (LDKT) is the treatment of choice for ESRD as it confers better patient and graft survival, shorter waiting time, and better quality of life than deceased donor kidney transplantation. However, compared to their representation on the waiting list, fewer Hispanics received a LDKT than non-Hispanic whites in 2013: 4 percent versus 10 percent. Barriers to LDKT for Hispanics include: lack of knowledge, cultural concerns, and language barriers. The disparity will likely worsen without intervention as Hispanics are the largest and fastest growing minority group in the US.  Few available culturally competent interventions have led to increased LDKT rates. Interventions rarely address Hispanic cultural concerns, and there are no published models of transplant center-based only programs. The Chicago Northwestern Medicine's(r) Hispanic Kidney Transplant Program (HKTP), a culturally and linguistically competent program, has increased Hispanic LDKTs. The mean annual ratio of Hispanic to non-Hispanic white LDKTs grew from 0.20 in 2001-2006 to 0.34 in 2008-2013, a 70 percent increase (p<0.001).  The objective of this study is to implement and evaluate the HKTP, a culturally-competent transplant center-based intervention, at two transplant centers serving large Hispanic populations (Dallas, TX, and Los Angeles, CA), with Northwestern University serving as the Study Coordinating Center. The pre-post HKTP intervention study will evaluate the effect of the HKTP's key culturally sensitive components (outreach, communication, education) on Hispanic LDKT rates, compared to matched controls. The specific aims are to:  1. Implement the HKTP at two transplant centers by conducting a needs assessment of barriers and using a learning collaborative model to deliver HKTP protocols, scripts, and materials.  2. Conduct a pre-post HKTP intervention evaluation with matched controls to assess if the HKTP is associated with an increase in: a) the ratio of Hispanic to non-Hispanic white LDKTs as a function of an absolute increase in Hispanic LDKTs, b) ESRD Hispanic patient additions to the waiting list, c) Hispanic potential donors per potential recipient, and d) Hispanic patients' satisfaction with care.  3. Formatively evaluate the fidelity and innovative adaptations to HKTP's outreach, communication, and education at both study sites to identify effective components of the HTKP, using mixed methods.  As an exploratory aim, a budget impact analysis will be conducted to construct a business case for transplant centers and permit estimates of HKTP scalability. The proposed study will provide valuable knowledge about the potential to rapidly disseminate the HKTP as a novel approach to increase Hispanic LDKTs nationally, improve health outcomes for Hispanics, and close the LDKT disparity gap."

"9383073","Project Summary Abstract This project seeks to identify new molecular pathways that are involved in pain signaling. The PI has pioneered a system that uses Drosophila as a platform for discovering genes required for the function of nociceptive sensory neurons. Understanding molecular mechanisms in nociceptors is of significance because sensory drive in nociceptors contributes to the development of central sensitization and subsequent chronic pain. Furthermore, congenital pain syndromes are caused by mutations in genes that affect the function of nociceptive sensory afferents in humans. Thus, a fundamental and basic understanding of the molecular mechanisms of nociceptive neurons is important for an understanding of chronic, neuropathic, and inflammatory pain. The laboratory of the PI has conducted a genetic screen which has led to the identification of a set of genes that are of importance to the function of nociceptive neurons. During the funding period experiments will be performed that seek to elucidate the molecular, cellular and physiological mechanisms of these newly implicated molecules."
"9313898","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early temporary windows of heightened brain plasticity called critical periods sculpt neural circuits and contribute to adult behaviors. Such heightened plasticity declines into adulthood. A clinically central issue is that this limits recovry of function later in life. The long-term goal of this study is to discover new regulatory mechanisms of plasticity to provide therapeutic targets to re-open plastic windows in the adult brain. One of the best-studied models of a critical period is the enduring loss of responsiveness in primary visual cortex (V1) to an eye deprived of vision, resulting in amblyopia (a loss of visua acuity), affecting 2-4% of the population and without a known cure in adulthood. Recently, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) system and its endogenous modulators that belong to Lynx family have emerged as key regulators of plasticity in adult V1.  Previous work showed that Lynx1 increases in expression after the critical period and acts as a brake to limit V1 plasticity in the adult brain. In preliminary studies, Lypd6, another Lynx family protein, was foun to act as a positive modulator of adult plasticity. However, the specific mechanisms of plasticity regulated by the Lynx family members, such as responsible cell-types, nAChR subtypes, and neural circuits regulated, etc, are totally unknown. The objective of this study is to identify novl mechanisms of plasticity by focusing on Lynx1 and Lypd6, which represent a new class of plasticity regulators that modulate nAChR signals.  Strikingly, these two Lynx family members have opposite expression patterns in two major subtypes of GABAergic interneurons: while Lynx1 is primarily expressed in parvalbumin interneurons, Lypd6 is exclusively expressed in somatostatin interneurons. Furthermore, viral manipulations of Lynx1 and Lypd6 in GABAergic neurons but not in glutamatergic neurons modulate adult V1 plasticity, making them unique targets to dissect the mechanisms of plasticity linking the nAChR and GABAergic systems. We hypothesize that Lynx1 and Lypd6 have distinct roles on GABAergic interneurons to regulate adult plasticity through modulation of specific nAChRs, and that the Lynx family can be an effective pre-clinical therapeutic target for treating amblyopia.  By combining cell-type specific gain/loss of gene expression through genetic and viral techniques with in vivo electrophysiology assisted by optogenetic tagging for cell-type specific measurements, and in vivo two- photon imaging of structural plasticity, we expect to identify the specific mechanisms of plasticity regulated by the Lynx family members, such as responsible cell-types, the nAChR subtypes, and neural circuits. Identification of such mechanisms would allow exploiting manipulations of the Lynx system in order to facilitate functional recovery after the end of the critical period, which would in turn lead to new opportunities to treat amblyopia and other disorders of cortical plasticity."
"9306970","The past decade has seen major advances in the tools available to neuroscientists, making it possible to ask increasingly specific questions regarding which neurons and circuits are correlated with, necessary for, and sufficient for, specific behavioral or computational functions. Two-photon laser scanning microscopy (TPLSM) is a widespread tool that allows three-dimensional imaging and photo-stimulation deep within intact brain tissue at neuron resolution. Numerous microscope manufacturers supply turnkey TPLSM systems that provide basic functionality for controlling the microscope during experiments, but no commercially available system allows the intricate experiments required to test the complex hypotheses of interest in systems neuroscience today. Vidrio?s mission is to address this gap with its software product, ScanImage, in a way that is stable, flexible, and of commercial-quality. Experimentalists need to perform ?closed-loop? experiments in which salient neurons are selected for temporally specific manipulation based on ongoing experimental results. Such capabilities are necessary because it is difficult to predict in advance which neurons will be engaged by the function under study and because neurons? involvement in computations are often restricted to specific phases of a task. This functionality requires software new scanning modes with real-time analysis and control. In our Phase 1 application we laid out a complete software development plan for enabling closed-loop TPLSM experiments. We demonstrated the feasibility of our approach in our Phase 1 work, which comprised integrating advanced laser-scanning capabilities with online CPU-based and FPGA-based data processing. Here we propose to complete our plan in Phase 2 by implementing the remaining key features needed for the next generation of systems neuroscience experiments. First, it is critical to be able to image one set of cells while simultaneously manipulating another set, in 3D. In Phase 1 work, we added control for two laser scanning paths to achieve X-Y independence; here in phase 2 we will add Z-control to achieve 3D targeting with 2um accuracy. Second, we will implement algorithms to enable interactive identification and motion- compensated targeting of salient neurons, by capitalizing on the high levels of data parallelism achieved by the CPU and FPGA implementations in Phase 1 work. Presenting researchers with ongoing maps of the correlations between neuronal activity in the field of view and their own quantitative definition of salience will allow them to rapidly select neurons for manipulation. Third, we will make this functionality easily accessible by designing and fabricating a reasonably priced ScanImage-optimized computer hardware device that integrates microscope control, data acquisition, and real-time image analysis. Successful completion of this project will enable Vidrio to market ScanImage in a financially self-sustaining manner, thus empowering researchers to elucidate how functionally defined subpopulations of neurons mediate specific information-processing functions at key moments during behavior, in healthy animals and in animal models of neurological diseases."
"9288809","Project Summary: Loud or extended noise exposure damages cochlear hair cells often resulting in either loss of synaptic connections with auditory nerve fibers or hair-cell death. One mechanism for this damage occurs through overstimulation of hair cells, which leads to a surge of Ca2+ at hair-cell synapses, metabolic stress on the hair cell, and excessive release of the neurotransmitter glutamate. The overall goal of this proposal is to understand how pathological changes at the hair-cell synapse stemming from excessive noise exposure ultimately contribute to noise-induced damage. Our objectives are to 1) test the hypothesis that hair-cell overstimulation triggers synaptic-ribbon loss, 2) determine the role of glutamate signaling in hair-cell pathology and repair of acoustic overexposure, and 3) identify the downstream effectors of glutamate-receptor mediated hair-cell death. Current gaps in our understanding of how hair-cell synapse overstimulation contributes to hair- cell damage are in large part due our inability to follow the time course of dynamic intracellular processes in noise-exposed hair cells and to separate glutamate induced damage to hair-cells versus innervating nerve terminals in mammalian cochlea. This project will circumvent these issues by investigating noise-induced hair-cell damage using live-cell imaging, tissue-specific genetic ablation, and pharmacological tools in the zebrafish lateral line? a mechanosensory organ which is made up of clusters of innervated hair cells. Zebrafish lateral-line hair cells are similar to mammalian hair cells at the molecular and cellular level, but are pharmacologically and optically accessible within the whole larvae. This feature allows for direct environmental manipulation and phenotypic observations in a live, intact preparation, which is currently not feasible in the mammalian cochlea. The results of each of our objectives will reveal how specific pathological changes at hair-cell synapses contribute to multiple pathologies resulting from excess noise exposure, thereby furthering our understanding of the underlying causes of sensorineural hearing loss."

Dartmouth is an ideal home for this Node, as it also the home of the NIDA- funded Center for Technology and Behavioral Health (CTBH), a P30 Center of Excellence that uses science to inform the development, evaluation, and strategic implementation of technology (web, mobile)-based therapeutic tools targeting substance use disorders (SUDs) and related issues (including HIV risk behavior and psychiatric comorbidities). CTBH is led by Dr. Lisa Marsch, who will also serve as the Principal Investigator on the proposed CTN node. Our team has led the field by enhancing the quality, pace of achievement, and impact of scientific research focused on the application of technology to SUD and behavioral health treatment. Our team has expertise in all stages of SUD intervention development, ranging from feasibility, acceptability, efficacy, efficacy-effectiveness, effectiveness (including multi-site effectiveness trials), cost-effectivenes, and implementation research in many contexts, including addiction and mental health specialty programs, medical specialty programs, hospitals, schools, criminal justice settings, and primary care. This work has included seminal research on the integration of SUD interventions into rural health care systems. This work has been conducted with a wide array of populations including chronic drug users, smokers, veterans, chronic pain patients, persons at risk for HIV, and persons with co-occurring SUDs and mental illness. Our group has particular expertise in research with youth, ranging from screening and assessment, prevention, treatment, recovery support, and care coordination for adolescents -- including several lines of research focused on cannabis use and prescription opioid use disorders among youth. The Aims of this proposal are to (1) Expand the NIDA CTN to new states in rural regions by launching the Northeast Node of the CTN and thereby expanding our collaborations with primary care and other community treatment partners in identifying and implementing timely and significant trials targeting SUDs, (2) Support and grow a productive research agenda with a particular focus on CTN trials that centrally leverage technology-based tools and/or have a priority focus on youth - both within the Northeast Node and via leadership and advisory roles within the national CTN community, and (3) Develop and support an infrastructure to enhance synergy and support bidirectional sharing of knowledge and resources between CTBH and the CTN. These activities will inform key scientific discoveries and insights regarding the substance use-related needs and priorities in rural health care systems as well as the effectiveness of technology-based interventions in a diverse array of community systems."
"9282516","Project Summary Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is an adult onset neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of motor neurons resulting in stiffness, weakness, muscle atrophy and death from failure of respiratory muscle 3-5 years after diagnosis. The only FDA approved drug for ALS, Riluzole, is only marginally effective. With disappointing therapeutic options, we have developed targeted therapeutic strategies for genetic subsets of ALS, such as those caused by dominantly inherited mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 gene (SOD1). Our previous data suggest that SOD1 in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) will be an excellent pharmacodynamics marker for an SOD1-focused therapeutic approach. One of the main missing pieces in understanding SOD1 as a marker is SOD1 CSF half-life data. The half-life of the protein will aid in clinical trial planning since half-life influences the amount of SOD1 protein reduction and will dictate the best timing of CSF collection for pharmacodynamics measures. We have recently made huge strides in understanding the protein kinetics of SOD1 by establishing a stable isotope amino acid labeling method using mass spectrometry to measure SOD1 half-life in rat models and normal, healthy human controls. While important first of its kind human data, the CSF SOD1 half- life we have established needs to be extended from normal controls to participants with ALS-causing SOD1 mutations. We will determine SOD1 half-life in CSF of 12 participants with SOD1 mutations by analyzing the kinetics of wild type, mutant, and total SOD1 protein. We hypothesize that the mutant half-life will be decreased in participants with SOD1 mutations. Additionally, some pathological studies suggest that SOD1 becomes misfolded in sporadic ALS and is therefore more broadly implicated in ALS. It is imperative to determine whether this is true as the need to develop SOD1-targeted therapeutics would be greatly increased. However, what's needed is an assay to determine SOD1 involvement in living patients. We hypothesize that protein half-life of SOD1 will be such a measure. We will determine SOD1 half-life in CSF of 19 controls and 19 sporadic ALS participants without SOD1 mutations using our kinetic method. If SOD1 half-life is decreased in sporadic ALS compared to controls, this would suggest that these participants may benefit from the SOD1 targeted strategy and we will consider a therapeutic trial in this population as well. With successful completion of this grant, we will have defined SOD1 kinetics in the most important patient population for SOD1 focused clinical trials and tested whether SOD1 half-life is decreased in sporadic ALS."
"9381236","Project Summary Excessive activity of osteoclasts (OC), the body's sole bone resorbing cells, is a major characteristic of pathogenic bone loss in periodontitis. Although a great deal is known about the process of OC differentiation, the identity of OC precursors (OCP) in vivo, and their role in periodontitis remain scarce, especially in aging where the extent of bone loss is increased. Recent studies have identified a cell cycle-arrested quiescent OCP present in very low numbers. These cells are receptor activator of NF-?B (RANK)-positive and express colony- stimulating factor-1 receptor (c-fms) at various levels, but scarcely express monocyte/macrophage/ granulocyte markers. Using in vivo mouse models, we have shown that infection with the periodontal-associated pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) induces the expansion of an earlier stage c-fms+RANK- OCP (eOCP) and the more advanced stage RANK+ OCP (rOCP) in bone marrow and spleen. In addition, eOCP and rOCP potently suppress CD4+ T cell proliferation in vitro, highlighting an important role of OCP in immune regulation. Moreover, compared to young mice, old mice show increased periodontal bone loss, as well as increased OCP frequency and osteoclastogenic potential, suggesting that increased OCP pool underlies host susceptibility to periodontal bone loss in aging. Based on our preliminary studies and published work, we hypothesize that Pg infection results in the expansion of OCP that can be shunted toward OC formation and bone loss at the infection/inflammation sites, while at the same time dampen host immune responses, which is beneficial for the persistence of infection and maintenance of chronic inflammation. We will test our hypothesis by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Delineate the regulation of OCP following Pg infection; 2) Determine the effect of OCP on host immune responses and bone loss in vivo to Pg infection. Our proposed studies will provide novel and significant insight into the pathogenesis of Pg infection and periodontitis leading to the potential development of targeted therapeutics for inflammatory bone loss diseases."
"9358182","International cancer genome characterization efforts have identified several protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) subunits as recurrently mutated or deleted in human cancers at a higher frequency than originally anticipated. This observation is not surprising since PP2A, the major serine-threonine phosphatase family in human cells, is broadly important in controlling cell signaling and homeostasis and particular PP2A subunits have been shown to act as tumor suppressor genes. However, progress in understanding PP2A has been confounded by the fact that the enzyme exists in at least 80 different isoforms. The study of the interactions of transforming proteins encoded by DNA tumor viruses and host cell proteins has identified many mechanisms that also contribute to the genesis of spontaneously arising cancers. In particular, the SV40 Early Region proteins bind to and inactivate several tumor suppressor gene products including retinoblastoma (RB) and p53. Studies of both SV40 small t antigen (SV40ST) and PyST, which interact with PP2A, have allowed us to begin to see how particular forms of PP2A contribute to tumor suppression. We have previously shown that suppressing particular PP2A subunits phenocopies cell transformation induced by SV40 ST and that these same PP2A subunits are tumor suppressor genes in human cancers. Using newly developed genome scale tools, we have systematically identified the specific PP2A subunits that contribute to cell transformation and have shown that loss of these subunits perturbs three pathways essential for cell transformation (WNT, MYC, AKT).  Although these studies have advanced our understanding of how perturbation of PP2A by SV40ST contributes to transformation, we lack a detailed molecular understanding of the molecular connections between PP2A and the pathways essential for cell transformation. We propose to integrate innovative genetic and proteomic technologies to identify substrates and pathways perturbed by tumor suppressor PP2A subunits. In recent work we have found that the STRiatin Interacting Phosphatase And Kinase (STRIPAK) complex not only binds ST-PP2A complexes but is also required for cell transformation induced by altering PP2A function. We hypothesize that ST, or mutations in tumor suppressor PP2A subunits, reprogram the PP2A holoenzyme complex not only by displacing tumor suppressor B subunits but also by modulating the interaction of PP2A with the STRIPAK complex in cancers of both viral and non-viral etiology. In this Project we will use biochemical, genetic and cell biological approaches to understand how PP2A-STRIPAK interactions induce cell transformation to not only enhance our mechanistic understanding of this tumor suppressor family but will also provide new insights into the pathways that help program the malignant state. In addition, these studies will provide a foundation for strategies to target these pathways therapeutically."
"9305107","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): LAPSE: Life After Pediatric Sepsis Evaluation It is well known that sepsis represents the leading cause of childhood mortality worldwide. However, as distinct from adult medicine, there exists a large knowledge gap regarding long-term health-related quality of life (HRQL) and functional status (FS) following pediatric sepsis. This lack of sepsis outcomes data is critical because failure to identify children at risk for sepsis-associated HRQL/FS deterioration may delay delivery of crucial rehabilitation medicine efforts to facilitate recovery. Moreover, failure to identify mechanisms of sepsis- associated HRQL/FS deterioration may impede development of novel, effective interventions for these children. For the first time this investigation will measure the incidence, intensity and duration of HRQL/FS alterations among children surviving septic shock, and examine potential clinical risk factors for such adverse outcomes. Mechanisms underlying adverse sepsis-associated outcomes among children are poorly understood at this time. Clinically however, two circular reciprocating sepsis insults, namely inflammation and ischemia/dysoxia, appear to be key antecedents for multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) that has been linked to sepsis mortality and perhaps long term morbidity. Organ failure burden, particularly cardiovascular and pulmonary dysfunction, has been shown to be strongly associated with long term morbidity and mortality following adult critical illness. The LAPSE investigation hypothesizes that validated measures of sepsis-mediated organ dysfunction will predict magnitude of sepsis-associated deterioration in HRQL/FS, and that recovery towards baseline HRQL/FS will be strongly influenced by complexity of children's chronic comorbid conditions and parent, family and home characteristics. As improving HRQL may be the most important goal of medicine, the long-term goal of this research program is to timely identify children at high risk of sepsis-mediated HRQL/FS deterioration and to ultimately design effective interventions to minimize such risk. The primary objectives of this application are to comprehensively characterize HRQL/FS outcomes and to critically examine the potential clinical risk factors for sepsis-associated HRQL/FS deterioration. The central hypothesis is that magnitude of HRQL/FS deterioration will be predicated on validated clinical markers of organ dysfunction, and that parent, family and home characteristics as well as premorbid conditions will influence trajectory back to baseline HRQL/FS. Knowledge of the contemporary natural history of pediatric septic shock will facilitate development of targeted interventions to maximize HRQL/FS among children surviving sepsis."
"9272409","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): mesenchyme cells of the sea urchin embryo provide a model system for exploring details of an epithelial to mesenchyme transition (EMT). This morphogenetic movement occurs in all organisms that produce, muscle, bone, and other mesenchyme tissues. Curiously, many parts of the EMT process are co-opted and used by metastatic cells often leading to catastrophic consequences. The EMT is highly complex and normally thought to be well controlled. Here, the system will be examined in detail to determine how the EMT is transcriptionally controlled and coordinated under normal circumstances. A developmental Gene Regulatory Network (GRN) was assembled during the previous funding cycles, and 10 transcription factors were discovered to have the proximal responsibility of controlling the EMT. Different subsets of the 10 transcription factors separately control onset of motility, invasive penetration of the basal lamina, de-adhesion, endocytosis, and other components of the EMT. This project will obtain answers to missing information on how the control circuit is activated, how the 10 transcription factors are integrated to coordinately regulate the complex cellular sequence that occurs in an EMT, and how the same control circuit is activated at least twice in development by two different tissues. The project will examine how 12 different cellular events are coordinately timed to sequence the transition. Each function utilizes many proteins and these must fall under the overall control circuitry. Since the same controlling circuit is activated in different cell types just upstream of EMT onset, the discovery f how that cell switches into the EMT circuit will be of great value both in normal embryonic cells, and in various disease states where an EMT launches the dissemination of abnormal cells."

"9304341","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We carried out two large screens to identify genes driving MPNST formation or maintenance: 1) An shRNA screen in human MPNST cell lines, and 2) a Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon- based insertional mutagenesis screen in a mouse model of MPNST. Both research approaches identified Wnt/?atenin-regulated pathways as critical mediators of MPNST maintenance. Preliminary data confirms that the Wnt/?atenin pathway is required for MPNST maintenance and can be targeted using small molecules. Remarkably, we identified multiple mechanisms of activation of ?atenin that operate in MPNST. Our proposal focuses on these. Aim 1 is based on our data demonstrating that genetic or pharmacological activation of the ?atenin destruction complex reduce ?atenin levels, reduce target gene expression, and inhibit cell survival and proliferation in MPNST. Aim 2 is based on data showing that some MPNSTs ectopically express a Wnt/?atenin activator R-spondin 2 (RSPO2) due to transcript fusion with the upstream EIF3E gene, a mechanism we recently identified in human colorectal cancer. Aim 3 is based on data revealing that the ?atenin target gene PITX2 plays a critical role in MPNST cell survival. Our goals are two-fold: to define the molecular landscape of ?atenin de- regulation in MPNST, and perform a thorough pre-clinical evaluation of critical targets for intervention in the Wnt/?atenin pathway in MPNST, setting the stage for effective clinical testing in human patients. The Co-PIs have established a successful collaborative relationship built on complementary skills and resources. Abundant and orthogonal preliminary data support the basic hypothesis of this proposal."
"9319737","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant:  There are an estimated 26 million Americans with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Early diagnosis and treatment are the only cost-effective means to reverse this growing problem. NIH recognizes the challenge to diagnose CKD early during its initiation and development phases in order to prevent further renal damage, reduce cardiovascular risk, and minimize the economic impact of CKD. Currently, two complimentary tests - estimated GFR (eGFR) and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) - are used to identify CKD and are effective once the onset of disease has occurred. We will produce a new ELISA for CKD to be employed as a diagnostic test based upon the use of a novel biomarker that reflects critical events in the pathophysiology of kidney disease. Preliminary results suggest that our CKD-ASSAY could replace or compliment both predicate assays. Further, the specificity and reproducibility of the results may reduce or eliminate the need for repeat testing. Aside from increased convenience and reduced time to treatment, this may mean that the cost of screening for CKD may be greatly reduced.  Our CKD-ASSAY would give physicians the ability to evaluate patients that have been recently diagnosed with hypertension, diabetes, or a family history of CKD. In Phase I, we evaluated the feasibility and proof-of principal of this test and found that the prototype assay in both at-risk populations was highly sensitive and specific. In Phase II, we confirmed the specificity of our CKD-ASSAY, established concordance with other assays, and looked for other factors that might have impacted on assay performance. We request Phase IIB support so that we can prepare cGMP kits, perform the pivotal clinical evaluations, submit our 510(k) application to the FDA, and prepare for commercial launch."
"9257889","Project Summary / Abstract The central goal of the Administrative Core is to break down conceptual, disciplinary, logistical, and physical barriers to empower Project and Core Leaders to pursue their specific aims and to address NIEHS' strategic goals and SRP mandates. To accomplish this goal, the Administrative Core provides fiscal and administrative support for the projects and cores, coordinates research activities, integrates research objectives, maintains a dialogue with the national SRP and other government agencies, and tracks metrics of program outcomes. The Core is structured to meet three primary objectives: 1) promote integration and cohesion of activities so that a given project or core can follow a rigorous and logical path while simultaneously responding to the mandates of the national SRP, 2) reduce administrative burdens on investigators to the extent consistent with investigator responsibilities for accountability and productive science, and 3) track program outcomes and use those outcomes for continual improvement. Goals and objectives will be met through the fulfillment of three Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: Provide an effective and flexible management structure for administration and project /core support. The Core is led by Dr. Sherr (Director) and Dr. Ozonoff (Deputy Director) who bring complementary expertise in molecular toxicology, epidemiology, and program administration. Leadership is supported by a full time, highly-skilled Administrative Staff Director, Dr. Jessica Ehinger, and two part-time administrators. The Core is supported by an active and dedicated Executive Committee and an outstanding External Advisory Committee with complementing expertise in molecular toxicology, ecology, early life chemical exposure, and community engagement/research translation. Specific Aim 2: Encourage and support interdisciplinary approaches to the SRP mission. This aim will be accomplished using principles of team science employed successfully in previous years and now augmented by proven strategies presented in the literature. These principles for inter- and transdisciplinary work include: 1) building collaborative and adaptive teams of investigators with overlapping but non-identical interests and expertise, 2) providing an effective communications infrastructure, and 3) maintaining strong program leadership committed to expanding interdisciplinary work thorough communication, integration, and supportive initiatives. Specific Aim 3: Enhance systems for evaluating BUSRP outcomes and for continuous improvement. The Administrative Core will augment use of the NIEHS Data Collection Form and CareerTrac with customized analytics tools to provide quantitative and qualitative feedback in real-time with relative ease and increased granularity. These analytics tools will enable the Program to expeditiously build on its strengths and address any emerging weaknesses. This evaluation and continuous improvement plan will continue to be refined, leveraging the resources of the Institutional Research and Evaluation Office on the Boston University Medical Campus."

"9409593","Although people living with HIV (PLWH) are increasingly linked and retained in HIV medical care, viral load suppression rates are not meeting benchmarks. Ryan White Part A (RWPA) ancillary service (e.g., food/ nutrition, housing, legal advocacy, substance abuse treatment) providers frequently have contact with ?floaters,? or PLWH who are not in RWPA services that offer HIV care and treatment adherence support (e.g., medical case management; MCM) and only access services to meet their basic needs. Ancillary service providers are an untapped opportunity for supporting HIV care and treatment adherence. From 3/2014 to 2/2015, 41% of New York City (NYC) RWPA clients were floaters. Of these, 36% were virally unsuppressed at some point during that year. Floaters comprise a large group of PLWH who need support in achieving VLS and are uniquely reachable through RWPA ancillary service providers. The goal of this mixed methods study is to use multiple data sources, including the NYC HIV Surveillance Registry (viral loads), Salient Information Manager (Medicaid information), Electronic System for HIV/AIDS Reporting and Evaluation (RWPA client data), and qualitative interviews to inform the development of feasible and acceptable HIV care and treatment adherence support interventions that could be delivered by ancillary service providers. A major strength of this study is our use of large NYC datasets to analyze service utilization and VLS in floaters. The Specific Aims are: (1) To use RWPA client, HIV surveillance and Medicaid data to better characterize floaters in terms of client and health care environment characteristics (e.g., agency and provider factors) and ancillary service utilization patterns, and to examine the association of these factors with viral load suppression; and (2) To use in-depth interviews with clients and providers, and questionnaires with RWPA program administrators to: (a) identify clients' perceived barriers to and facilitators of HIV care and treatment adherence and participation in MCM, and attitudes towards receiving HIV care and treatment support from ancillary service providers, (b) assess ancillary service providers' awareness of floaters, efforts to support their HIV care and treatment adherence, and willingness to do so; and (c) identify health care environment characteristics that would facilitate or inhibit the implementation of HIV care and treatment adherence support interventions delivered by ancillary services providers. Together with a Community Collaboration Board, we will use these data to develop interventions that will be further developed and testing in a subsequent R34 study.  "
"9307947","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Surfactant protein A (SP-A) is an excellent marker of fetal lung maturity and type II cell differentiation. The SP- A gene is silent throughout most of gestation; transcription is induced after ~85% of gestation is complete with increased surfactant lipid synthesis. SP-A gene expression in human fetal lung (HFL) is induced by cAMP and inhibited by hypoxia and transforming growth factor-? (TGF-?). To further define genetic and epigenetic mechanisms for type II cell differentiation, developmental and hormonal regulation of SP-A expression, we are investigating the roles of microRNAs (miRNAs, miRs). We observed that members of the miR-200 and miR-29 families were significantly upregulated in mouse and HFL with type II cell differentiation. This was associated with decreased expression of known miR-200 targets, the repressive transcription factors ZEB1 and ZEB2, as well as functionally related factors, Snail1 and Snail2. ZEB1/2 and Snail1/2 are induced by TGF-? and serve critical roles in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that contributes to branching morphogenesis, tumor progression and, possibly, fibrosis. Notably, both miR-200s and miR-29s are suppressed by TGF-? and inhibited in pulmonary fibrosis. We found that overexpression of ZEB1 or ZEB2 in cultured HFL type II cells blocked cAMP stimulation of SP-A expression, while cAMP markedly inhibited ZEB1/2 and Snail1/2. Both miR-29s and miR-200s target TGF-? and stem cell factor, KLF4, while miR-29 targets transcriptional silencing factors, DNA methyltransferases 3a/3b and histone deacetylase (HDAC)4. These findings support the overall hypothesis that miR-200 and miR-29 families and their targets serve important, interacting regulatory roles in chromatin modification, type II cell differentiation and function in fetal lung Moreover, we propose that an imbalance in this miRNA/target relationship can result in impaired alveolarization and lung pathology. To test this thesis, we propose the following specific aims. In Aim 1, we will complete ongoing studies to analyze temporal and spatial changes in expression of miR-200 and miR-29, ZEB1/2 and Snail1/2 in fetal mouse lung and in mid-gestation HFL explants and cells; effects of cAMP, TGF-? and O2 tension will be analyzed and correlated with expression of markers of type II cell differentiation and EMT. Expression and functional roles of transcription factors that potentially regulate these miRNAs, including GATA3/6, p53, Gli, c-Myc, and TTF-1, their developmental and hormonal regulation also will be analyzed. In Aim 2, quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation will be used to analyze developmental changes and effects of TGF-?, cAMP, and O2 tension, overexpression and knockdown of miRNAs and EMT factors on SP-A promoter binding of endogenous histone-modifying enzymes, coregulators and modified histones in mouse and HFL. In Aim 3, effects of conditional deletion of the miR-200 and miR-29 family in mice on lung branching morphogenesis, alveolar development, type II cell differentiation and EMT will be assessed, as will their impact on lung pathology."
"8112387","Mouse models of atherosclerosis provide an opportunity to examine the role of particular genes in  lesion initiation and progression, but the data from different published studies are often difficult to  compare. This is due to the use of different diets, analysis times (primarily very short times), sites of  analysis, and the limitation of testing to a single mouse model. To address these problems, Core A  will use the same protocols for all mouse studies, utilize a diet the mimics the Th1 inflammatory  response observed in human disease, analyze multiple time points including very late stages of  lesion development, and analyze 3 sites of lesion formation for all mice. It will centralize the  generation and breeding of gene-knockout mice, and will perform bone-marrow transplants using  these animals. The core laboratory has also recently developed a macrophage-specific retroviral  vector that allows efficient transduction of hematopoietic stems cells that leads to gene expression  in lesion macrophages in vivo. All of the projects in this PPG will utilize these approaches to perturb  inflammatory genes and ask how these changes alter the initiation and progression of  atherosclerotic lesions. The Core will also facilitate, coordinate and standardize sacrifice of all  project study animals, prepare and blind tissue for analysis, provide histological stains and all  quantitative methods of analysis. The combined analyses using identical protocols will allow direct  comparison of the effects of perturbation of different inflammatory gene products, including  inflammatory genes involved in the regulation of macrophage recruitment and activation and  survival pathways."
"9319137","ABSTRACT ? Developmental Core (Core B)  The goal of the Duke CFAR Developmental Core is to stimulate new investigator-initiated research  breakthroughs in HIV/AIDS by supporting CFAR members. We propose three mechanisms of support that  correspond to our Specific Aims: 1) funding of pilot projects, 2) providing financial support for faculty  recruitment and 3) enhancing mentoring activities and mentoring resources for all CFAR members. Funding for  four categories of pilot projects (Small Grants, Emerging Opportunities, Strategic Partnerships, and Scientific  Working Group-related) will continue to support primarily junior and new HIV/AIDS investigators using an NIH-  style peer review process to provide funding on a competitive basis; thanks to our identification of co-funding  partners, our addition of Scientific Working Group-related pilots has not affected in any way our Small Grant  program. Summary statements will be provided to all applicants as a mentoring tool to provide critical feedback  to enhance grant-writing skills. Grant review training will also be provided. Of 78 Small Grant proposals  submitted in the previous four years, all received an NIH-style summary statement and 31 were selected for  funding. Our faculty recruitment efforts will continue to help recruit exceptional faculty to Duke in support the  CFAR mission. In the past four years, the CFAR has aided in the recruitment of 8 young faculty members: 5  female, 3 male including 1 underrepresented minority (URM); another URM CFAR member was promoted from  a postdoctoral fellow to an Assistant Professor. In the proposed funding cycle, one of the past CFAR faculty  recruits will serve as Co-Director for the Developmental Core. The provision of mentoring and mentoring  activities is the final activity of the Developmental Core. Our mentoring activities and resources both connect  CFAR members with existing career development activities and resources at Duke, which emphasize grant  writing skills, and complement these by providing grant review mentoring and a requirement that all Small  Grant awardees participate in a mentoring program. Grant review mentoring is provided as a component of the  pilot projects application and funding process, and awardees' defined mentoring program can be through their  primary academic department or through the CFAR. The Developmental Core is committed to contributing to  CFAR's priority to increase the diversity of CFAR membership by attracting individuals who are  underrepresented in the medical profession. To help achieve this goal, the Development Core will participate in  a variety of activities designed to increase the diversity of students, fellows and faculty performing HIV/AIDS  research at Duke."
"8106546","The assembly of triadyglycerol-rich lipoproteins (TAG-LP) involves the initial formation of a small HDL sized  primordial particle with a neutral lipid core and a later process which adds TAG and phospholipid (PL) to  create nascent VLDL. The N-terminal 20.5% of apoB(B0.5) has homology to lipovitellin (LV) that consists of  an N-terminal beta barrel, a region of 17 amphipathic alpha helices (AaH) and 2 beta sheet domains, the A and C  sheets. Proper folding of the N-terminal is necessary for secretion since certain point mutations and failure  to form disulfide bonds target it to degradation. Limited proteolysis of 617 and B20.5 indicates that apoB  homology to LV is approximate but not exact. Structural determination of isolated proteolytic and expressed  domains using CD, NMR and X-ray diffraction will define B20.5 domains at the molecular level. The  assembly with lipids as driven by the primary sequence of apoB is studied in MTP-deficient C127 cells  transfected with C-terminally truncated forms. The role of molecular chaperones in folding, lipidation and in  quality control is studied both in C127 and hepatoma-derived cells. The region from B20.5 to B29 recruits  surface molecules, mainly PL to the nascent particle. As the peptide lengthens from B20.5 to B29 the  number of surface molecules increases from approximately 5 to about 70 per particle. The sequence between B32 and B41 recruits almost 200 TAG (about 1 TAG/2.3 aa) which form nascent particles with a cryo-EM discernable core  which is not seen in B32.5. Biophysical analysis shows that B37 and B41 peptides must interact directly with  the core. This region contains 24 amphipathic beta strands (ApS) 12-15 aa long. Consensus 12 aa ApS and  27 aa p sheet peptides bind to oil/water (O/W) interfaces, are elastic and are not displaced at high pressure.  ApoB also contains 2 major regions a2 and a3 of AaH. Consensus AaH peptides bind to O/W and air/water  interfaces, but are ejected at a critical pressure into the aqueous phase. Native apoB also binds to the  TAG/W interface and cannot be fully displaced by high pressure, but parts of the apoB come off when  compressed and snap back on rapidly when the surfaces are again expanded. Thus, we suggest the flexible  parts of apoB are AaH and the non-exchangeable part is AbetaS. This project dissects the complex pathway by  which bad cholesterol (apoB associated cholesterol, VLDL, LDL) is made and secreted by the liver. The  long term goal is to find procedures or drugs to reduce bad cholesterol, heart attack and stroke."

These events are key in maintaining a high degree of collegiality and collaboration and for ensuring continued focus on the Program's overall goal of deciphering the human cancer suppression functions of Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A). The Core also plays a major role in supporting the PI, Project and Core Leaders as they discuss and enact PI decisions.  The Administrative Core is responsible for the financial accounting for the Program, Projects and Cores. In coordination with the DFCI Department of Medical Oncology-supported business office, the Administrative Core deals with the research administration offices of the two participating institutions (DFCI and Tufts) on financial and protocol issues, and it insures the smooth distribution of funds through the subcontracting process.  The Administrative Core assists the PI, Project and Core Leaders to prepare all annual NIH/NCI reports, ensuring that IRB and IACUC protocols are properly executed, maintaining the appropriate open access to Program supported scientific publications, and maintaining up to date bibliographies in MyNCBI.  The Administrative Core will promote the training of post-doctoral fellows, graduate students and other laboratory personnel. In part, this goal will be accomplished through the monthly meetings and annual retreat where trainees will present their data. In addition, the Administrative Core will facilitate cross training in techniques, protocols and experimental approaches from one lab in the Program to another.  To accomplish these goals, the Administrative Core has three specific aims. Aim 1: Provide leadership and administrative expertise to enable a program that is focused on PP2A. Aim 2: To facilitate collegiality, collaboration, coordination and communication across the Program. Aim 3: To further the training and development of scientists."
"9390538","PROJECT SUMMARY . In psychiatry, we are limited by the mismatch between the diverse heterogeneity of the brain and the tools we have to treat it. We know from anatomic, cortical mapping, and imaging studies that every several millimeters of the brain is constituted, connected, and functions in a unique and significantly different manner. However, the current standard of care for many if not most psychiatric diseases is delivery of a small molecule drug to the entire body, with the hope that this nonspecific delivery will somehow have the right specific effect on the right part of the brain, without significant nonspecific action in the rest of the brain or body. What if instead we could deliver the right drug, to the right part of the brain, at the right time?  We can do exactly that by combining ?phase-change? nanoparticle-based drug delivery and MRI-guided focused ultrasound. In doing so, we could obtain spatiotemporally precise and noninvasive control of neuromodulatory inputs, with an immediate path for clinical translation. In eventual clinical usage, phase-change nanoparticles that are loaded with the desired drug will be infused intravenously into a patient. The nanoparticles will redistribute throughout the blood pool in their inert form. Then, focused ultrasound will be applied only to the part of the brain where drug activity is desired. Ultrasound will induce drug release from the nanoparticles into the intravascular space. The drug will then rapidly cross the blood-brain barrier to act only in the sonicated region of the brain. Throughout this procedure, the patient will be otherwise awake and able to participate in a neuropsychiatric assessment, functional brain imaging, and/or cognitive behavioral therapy. The uncaging sonication could be repeated or applied to one or more additional brain regions throughout the time that the nanoparticles reside in the blood pool. Importantly, this technology could serve as a platform for brain-mapping studies that need to specifically modulate only one biochemical pathway in one brain region of one neural circuit. This would also have significant advantages for clinical care by maximizing therapeutic effect while limiting side effects, and for allowing pseudo-lesion studies to map functional brain regions prior to neurosurgery.  In this proposal, we will build upon our preliminary data to refine the specificity and potency of this technique, and lay the groundwork for clinical translation: (1) we will establish a protocol for production of these nanoparticles that is scalable for larger animals and for humans, and that is compatible with established standards for clinical administration; (2) using combined focused ultrasound and EEG in rats, we will determine the temporal resolution and kinetics of the neuromodulatory effect induced by localized release of the small molecule anesthetic propofol by ultrasonic uncaging from our nanoparticles; and (3) using combined focused ultrasound and PET imaging in rats, we will quantify the spatial extent and resolution of localized propofol release from our nanoparticles by visualizing its effect on GABAA receptor binding. Following successful completion of these foundational experiments, we will build on this proposal by moving rapidly towards clinical translation."

"9308007","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of the Network of Excellence in Neuroscience Clinical Trials (NEXT) initiative is to rapidly and efficiently translate advances n neuroscience into treatments for people with neurological disorders. Acute and chronic neurological disorders impose a massive burden on both patients and society. The potential exists to change this situation if recent major discoveries in basic neuroscience can be exploited effectively. Challenges to the successful and efficient development of treatments for people with neurological disorders include inefficiencies in regulatory and institutional approvals, a variety f barriers to recruitment of subjects that slow down clinical research, and a shortage of individuals trained and prepared to lead multicenter clinical research. The primary goal of the Clinical Coordinating Center (NEXT-CCC) is to facilitate, from initial conception through final analysis, clinical trials in adult and pediatric neurological disorders by providing efficient methodological organizational and logistical support. The NEXT-CCC will establish processes that will dramatically increase the efficiency of multicenter clinical trials, improve the quality of clinica trials, promote patient recruitment and retention and increase the number of clinical investigators and research staff who are well-trained and passionate about leading and conducting multicenter clinical trials. Specific Aim 1 is to create a collaborative Clinical Coordinating Center and network infrastructure to efficiently conduct high-quality clinical trials for neurological disorders in both adult and pediatric populations. Specific Aim 2 is to expand the pool of experienced clinical Investigators and research staff who are prepared to be leaders of multicenter clinical research trials by providing education, training, resources and professiona mentorship. Specific Aim 3 is to engage and mobilize federal, industry, foundation and patient partners by working with the Steering Committee, NEXT-DCC, and Project Team Principal Investigators to organize high-impact clinical trials for neurological disorders through the network."
"9358821","CORE SUMMARY The purpose of the Animal and Microsurgery Core (Core B) is to establish a focused facility that provides investigators in each of the two projects with sufficient breeding of animals with specified genotypes and with standardized cardiac or skin transplantation and tolerance induction procedures for the proposed experiments. Core B will provide a key service role that will enable the Principal Investigators and their staff to focus on experimental and scientific efforts. Centralized breeding and screening of the progeny will ensure that animals of required genotypes are available for experiments. Transplantation performed by a centralized source will standardize the procedures, minimize surgically imposed disparities in the grafts used by the two projects and allow some long-term acceptors generated for Project 1 (studying novel T cell mechanisms in robust tolerance) to be used for Project 2 (studying the maintenance of tolerance) to minimize experimental costs. In addition, the purchase of supplies, such as sutures, anesthetics and immunosuppressants will be done in bulk for both projects to reduce cost. The specific tasks of Core B will be to: a) breed and genotype animals to be used for both projects; b) transplant heart allografts as directed by the project leaders and their personnel; c) prepare and inject donor splenocytes and administer indicated immunosuppressive therapies; d) monitor the beating of the transplanted hearts, the health of the transplant recipients, and record times of rejection; e) sacrifice transplanted animals as directed by the Principal Investigators and their personnel, and collect organs for histology, as well as to distribute to other project personnel for phenotypic and functional analysis of immune cells."
"9304202","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): 70-80% of kidney stones (KS) are composed of calcium oxalate, and minor changes in urine oxalate affect the stone risk. Obesity is a risk factor for KS and obese stone formers often have mild hyperoxaluria. A positive correlation between increased body size and elevated urinary oxalate excretion was reported; however, the underlying mechanism(s) remain(s) unknown. Therefore, we initiated studies in the obese ob/ob (ob) mice to define the pathogenesis of the obesity-associated hyperoxaluria (OAH). ob mice were found to have significantly higher urine oxalate (adjusted for creatinine) compared to controls (>2.9-fold), which is not due to overeating using pair-feeding. Significant hyperoxaluria was also seen in the obese db/db mice (> 2.3-fold). We observed significantly higher jejunal (> 46%) and ileal (>30%) 14C-oxalate and 3H-mannitol (a paracellular marker) absorptive fluxes in ob mice compared to controls ex vivo. Importantly, a significantly higher (>35%) urine 13C-oxalate was observed in ob mice compared to controls following an oral gavage with 13C-oxalate. The proinflammatory cytokines (PCs) IFN-? [IFN] and TNF-? [TNF], which are elevated in obesity, caused > 3- fold increase in apical to basolateral 14C-oxalate and 3H-mannitol fluxes in human intestinal Caco2-BBE (C2) cells. The PC-induced increased absorptive fluxes were completed blocked by pretreatment with AMP-18 and GLP-2, peptides known to improve intestinal barrier function. Pretreatment of BALB/c mice with TNF before isolating and mounting jejunal segments in Ussing chambers led to > 1.9-fold increase in 14C -oxalate and 3H- mannitol absorptive fluxes, an effect completely blocked by pretreatment with AMP or GLP. IFN, TNF, and IL-6 also significantly inhibited apical 14C-oxalate uptake by C2 cells through mechanisms involving reduced SLC26A6 (A6), an anion exchanger with essential role in intestinal oxalate secretion, mRNA/total protein expression. In addition, ob mice have significantly reduced jejunal A6 mRNA (>65%) and total protein expression. while a small net oxalate secretory flux was observed in control jejunal tissues, a large net absorptive flux was seen in ob tissues, due to significantly reduced secretory flux and an increased absorptive flux . Based on these findings, I will test the hypothesis that PCs play an important role in the OAH, and that anti-TNF, anti-IFN, and/or anti-IL-6 will normalize and/or ameliorate the observed hyperoxaluria. The following specific aims will be pursued: 1a. Evaluate the therapeutic effects of anti-TNF, anti-IFN, and anti-IL-6 on the observed hyperoxaluria.1b. Evaluate the effects of crossing the ob mice with the TNF, IFN, and/or IL-6 null mice on the observed hyperoxaluria to confirm their roles in the OAH. 2a. Assess small and large intestinal paracellular permeability in vivo in ob mice and their controls. 2b. Examine the therapeutic effects of AMP and GLP on the observed hyperoxaluria. 2c. Elucidate the in vivo mechanisms by which AMP, GLP, anti-TNF, anti- IFN, and/or anti-IL-6 normalize and/or ameliorate the observed hyperoxaluria. 3. Evaluate the effects of crossing the ob mice with the A6 null mice on the observed hyperoxaluria to confirm the role of A6 in the OAH."

"8114841","Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) mediates the release of Ca from intracellular stores by interacting with a family of  highly conserved receptors which contain an intrinsic Ca release channel. The InsP3 receptor (InsP3R) shares both  structural and sequence similarities with the ryanodine receptor (RyR), the primary Ca release channel of the  sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in cardiac and skeletal muscle. The type-2 InsP3R is the predominant isoform expressed  in cardiac myocytes, but its localization and function in heart have been elusive. In ventricular myocytes the InsP3R2 is  targeted to the nuclear envelope and it interacts with Ca-calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). A goal of  this project is to identify and characterize proteins interacting with the InsP3R2 expressed in cardiac myocytes that are  critical for function and modulation of local Ca signaling events (regarding both regulation of InsP3R by CaMKII and  regulation of CaMKII by Ca release from InsP3R). The central focus encompasses detailed study of InsP3R2/CaMKIIdelta interactions and the functional consequences with respect to Ca signaling and nuclear signaling in hypertrophy & heart failure. A second emphasis is the characterization, use and further development of novel FRET-based biosensors for  in situ measurement of InsP3 liberation and concentration.  There are 5 Specific Aims in this project that will address the InsP3R2/CaMKII interaction and function.  1) Test the hypothesis that the InsP3R2 localized to the nuclear envelope of cardiac myocytes interacts with CaMKII  and forms a macromolecular complex.  2) Test the hypothesis that the interaction of CaMKII directly modulates the InsP3R2 Ca release channel properties.  3) Determine the physiological consequences of perturbing or disrupting the InsP3R2-CaMKII interaction.  4) Test the hypothesis that the spatial/temporal patterns of expression levels for the InsP3Rs are altered during ES cell  development, hypertrophy and heart failure.  5) Generate a biological sensors to measure the free concentration of InsP3 in an intact cells.  These studies will provide considerable new information regarding InsP3R in cardiac myocytes in health and disease.  This is especially the case with respect to localization, molecular partners and regulation of function. Additionally, we  anticipate that the InsP3-biosensors will become important new tools in the InsP3 field. This work is highly synergistic  with all three other projects in the Program Project Grant."
"9246321","Scientific Project 1: Immune Responses to Preerythocytic Malaria This project will comprehensively define human immune responses during the pre-erythrocytic stage of Plasmodium falciparum infection and vaccination with attenuated sporozoites which prevents infection and thus target this stage. It will identify immune signatures during the pre-erythrocytic, immunization and post vaccination periods in complementary vaccine trials that assess protection by controlled human malaria infection (CHMI). The primary endpoint is a correlation of vaccine-induced protection from infection, secondary endpoints are the effects of prior malaria exposure and differences in immunization protocols, vaccines and CHMI methods. The exploratory endpoints include the identification of signals that implicate immune processes that contribute to protection. The approach combines formal statistical methods, well-defined endpoints and system biology analyses. It systematically integrates high-dimensional with diverse immunological analyses to generate an expansive immunological view to identify and assess signals that are associated with protection. It aims to: 1. Identify immune responses during the pre-erythrocytic stages of infection. Virtually nothing is known about this stage the infection in the liver during which there is extensive parasite replication and synthesis of new antigens. We will identify signals of infection and of immunization with attenuated SPZs during this stage and compare variations among trials. 2. Determine immune response kinetics over the immunization period. We will identify the kinetics of innate and adaptive immunological signals during immunization with attenuated SPZs and identify the development of those that correlate with protection and how these differ among the trials. We will deduce molecular and cellular features from the signals that correlate with each variable to provide insight into immune processes that are associated with each endpoint. 3. Compare responses at and following of malaria challenge infection. We will identify signatures in samples from vaccinees prior to and following assessment by CHMI of protection from infection. We will compare immune signatures that are associated with each endpoint. The results from all of the aims will be used to guide the selection and testing of specific hypotheses about the mechanisms that underlay each of the endpoints. Overall, the comprehensive and integrated immunological and systems biology analyses will identify immune signatures during the critical stage of infection by and immune protection against a complex protozoan pathogen. It will generate and analyze pooled data from multiple complementary vaccine trials in order to identify correlates of protection from infection, how these are affected by variables among the trials. It will provide insight into multiple aspects of immune processes that are operative during infection and affected by vaccination."

"9312023","Project Summary Our laboratory has developed novel culture methods using engineered Notch ligands to increase the number of CD34+ precursors, including those able to provide rapid hematopoietic engraftment in patients undergoing cord blood (CB) transplantation. Clinical trials indicate the need to derive greater hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) numbers for a more potent, economically feasible therapy. Consequently, this grant aims to elucidate new strategies to regulate Notch-induced signal strength to maximize HSPC growth, focusing on exploiting differences in 1) Notch receptor susceptibility to activation among HSPC subsets and 2) Notch signal strength necessary to promote HSPC expansion versus T cell differentiation. Towards this goal, we have determined that antibodies raised against the amino-terminus of the Notch extracellular domain are more effective than Notch ligands in activating receptors on primitive HSPC, leading to increased generation of in vivo repopulating cells; preliminary studies have suggested this results from antibody-mediated subversion of inhibitory effects imposed by endogenously expressed ligands in primitive HSPC (cis-inhibition). Thus, in Aim 1, we test our hypothesis that differential agonist potency in promoting Notch activation and HSPC generation results from ligand-mediated cis-inhibition. We will investigate inhibitory ligand expression and function in CB HSPC using shRNA knockdown and/or blocking antibody treatment together with transplantation assays. To elucidate the mechanism whereby antibody subverts cis-inhibition, guiding the future development of improved agonists, we will determine the contribution of target epitope location and increased agonist affinity. Our previous studies have also determined requirements for distinct levels of Notch signaling for generation of HSPC versus promotion of T cell differentiation. Thus, in Aim 2, we test our hypothesis that the use of paralog- specific Notch antibody agonists will fine-tune the level of Notch activation to concurrently enhance the generation of marrow and thymic repopulating cells. We will investigate the dynamic use of low densities of Notch paralog-specific antibody agonists to further increase marrow repopulating cell generation by inducing Notch activation in cis-inhibited primitive precursors, yet maintain a low level of Notch signal strength to prevent diversion of these cells to the T-lineage. We further explore whether paralog-specific antibody agonists can simultaneously generate marrow and thymic repopulating cells by inducing different levels of Notch activation in different hematopoietic subsets. Overall, these studies will provide insight into the cell- autonomous mechanisms regulating Notch receptor function, an outcome of conceptual and practical interest to those focused on manipulating cell-fate decisions in Notch-dependent stem cell types, most relevant here, the expansion of HSPC and prothymocyte precursors for the development of viable clinical therapeutics."
"9314582","Overview and Specific Aims The overall objective of the Clinical and Translational Pilot Grant (CTPG) KCA is to build clinical and translational research capacity and extramural funding success among researchers in the Western IDeA states. Clinical and Translational Research addressing the unique regional health issues of the Western Region IDeA states has been carried out mainly in colleges of science, liberal arts, and allied health sciences, in departments of public health, nursing, social work, psychology, and related programs. However, these projects and programs are often underfunded, struggling with inadequate infrastructure support, constrained by limited availability of faculty release time, isolated from one another, and limited in scope. Support from a comprehensive pilot project program will substantially accelerate these existing efforts and bring them to a level competitive for independent extramural funding. The last decade has seen an unprecedented increase in NIH-funded research within the Western Region IDeA states, largely due to the support from COBRE and INBRE programs. Overall, these COBRE and INBRE programs have been very successful, but they have been focused almost entirely on pre-clinical research. There has been little support or infrastructure available to help this talented cadre of pre-clinical investigators move into translational research. This KCA will implement a program to fund pilot grants supporting projects likely to lead to independent NIH funding for both clinical, and translational, investigators. Awards will be based on reviews of scientific merit and the alignment of the proposed research with the mission of the CTN-IN. We will solicit proposals for clinical and translational research projects on topics including, but not limited to, health issues and health care access among rural and vulnerable populations in the Western Region IDeA states. The funds devoted to this program will translate to a high yield return on investment as investigators develop interdisciplinary collaborations and generate proof of principal data to accelerate successful extramural grant funding, ultimately hastening the adoption of transformative health-related discoveries by health care providers."

The study will use cutting edge techniques to characterize reactivation related molecular motions of hAChE in solution based on X-ray and neutron scatter in equilibrium and resolved in time from ps to min intervals. High resolution joint X-ray/neutron diffraction on hAChE crystals at room temperature will be used to resolve precise positions of protons and complete water molecules in the hAChE active center. Both scattering and diffraction studies will rely on comparative analysis of native, OP-conjugated, and aged hAChE alone, and in complex with selected structurally diverse oxime reactivators and will be aimed at identifying structural features of oximes optimal for overcoming limitations imposed by structural dynamics and proton distribution in the hAChE active center. The acquired information coupled with advanced computational analysis and simulation will be used to design prototypic accelerated oxime reactivator of OP-hAChE. The structures of prototypic accelerated reactivators will be made available for synthesis and refinement using our existing drug design pipeline developed in collaboration with researchers of The Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla."

"9274919","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My goal, using this Mentored Clinical Scientist Career Development Award, is to achieve expertise in Molecular Oncology so that I may become an independent investigator in Breast Cancer Research. I have had a long- standing commitment to translational, patient-oriented research and treatment in the field of medical oncology, as evidenced by my clinical and research training. My career focus is the translation of basic science concepts into practical improvements for patients being treated for breast cancer (BC). I am particularly interested in developing innovative treatments for patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) by understanding both the biology and etiology of this disease. Unlike the targeted therapies identified by basic science to successfully treat hormone receptor (ER+/PR+) and growth factor (HER2+) overexpressing breast cancer, I have been frustrated by the lack of rational therapies for TNBC and as a result have witnessed the difficulty in successfully treating patients with TNBC. It is because of the inability to effectively treat TNBC that I have performed research for the past 2.5 years working with Dr. K. Frenkel, investigating the diverse anti-tumor effects of caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE). CAPE is a major bioactive component of propolis, a natural product gathered by honeybees and used safely for millennia. My published work has shown that CAPE inhibits breast cancer cells, including MDA-MB-231 (MDA-231, a model for TNBC) breast tumor growth in vitro as well as in vivo via cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and inhibition of angiogenesis (Jing W, Omene C, 2011). Importantly, CAPE inhibits MDA-231 TNBC stem cells with a subsequent decrease in tumor-forming potential (Omene C, 2011). We found through the collaboration with Dr. OA O'Connor that these anti-tumor effects of CAPE are related in part to its role as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor (Omene C et al, unpublished). For example, CAPE exposure leads to a decrease in EGFR over-expression, a key driver in the proliferation of TNBC, and epigenetically, causes the re-expression of a previously silenced estrogen receptor (ER) gene in MDA- 231 TNBC cells. This project offers me a unique opportunity to study the development of TNBC and attempt to modify the risk of its development by CAPE, using a new mouse model of TNBC established by Dr. Barcellos-Hoff, my mentor for this award. This radiation chimera model in which an irradiated host is transplanted with oncogenic Trp53 null mammary epithelium exhibits an accelerated development of aggressive tumors whose molecular signatures are distinct from tumors arising in non-irradiated hosts. Tumors arising in the irradiated host are predominantly estrogen receptor negative and this was linked to mammary stem cell (MaSC) deregulation. This model will allow me to meld together data from my work using CAPE and interest in TNBC to test whether CAPE can be used to modify the risk of developing TNBC. We hypothesize that prevention of cancer development in this TNBC model will be achieved by CAPE due to its novel HDAC inhibitor properties. We plan to: 1) Establish whether CAPE affects tumor latency and/or tumor type in irradiated mice, 2) Determine whether CAPE modifies the mammary stem cell pool isolated from irradiated mice and 3) Assess the effect of CAPE action as an inhibitor of histone deacetylase in irradiated cells. This research will significantly contribute to our understanding of TNBC development. It has the potential to be readily translatable as chemoprevention in the clinical setting for populations at high risk for TNBC. In addition, TNBC patients have limited treatment options and CAPE used as chemoprevention could impact on the prognosis of these women. I am confident that I can accomplish the goals as outlined in this proposal as I move toward becoming an independent investigator given the wide array of resources available to me. They include an outstanding researcher as a mentor, a multitude of educational opportunities, an excellent institutional environment, shared core facilities and many expert key faculty members readily available to share their expertise."
"9316638","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is one of the leading causes of blindness in the United States and many other nations and is the leading cause of blindness in African Americans. Elevated intraocular pressure (ocular hypertension or OHT) is a major risk factor for developing POAG and the only modifiable risk factor at present. 4-7% of the United States population above age 40 has OHT. A major public health issue is how to apply the principles of patient- centered care and manage this large group of people in an effective and cost-effective manner. The OHTS carefully followed OHT participants for a median of 13 years. (OHTS Phase 1 and 2) This includes 279 participants who developed POAG during the study, the largest inception cohort of POAG patients ever described. We propose to re-examine all surviving OHTS participants at 20 years or more in 2015-2017 (OHTS Phase 3). We will determine the incidence and severity of POAG in the OHTS cohort and determine the frequency and severity of self-reported functional limitations associated with POAG. We will also develop a 20-year prediction model for stratifying OHT patients by their risk of developing POAG and, among those who developed POAG, a prediction model for the rate of visual field loss. OHTS Phase 3 will allow us to develop evidence-based, 20-year guidelines for the management of patients with OHT. This will aid patients and clinicians to make informed decisions about the appropriate frequency of examinations and tests and the benefit of early, preventative treatment. Informed decisions should improve outcomes, reduce costs and reduce patient and clinician burden."
"9301544","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One in every three children is overweight or obese. Overweight and obesity in childhood is associated with negative health and psychosocial consequences for children and adults. To date, the most successful weight loss treatment for children who are overweight or obese are family-based behavioral programs (FBT) that are delivered in separate parent and child groups over a 6-month period. FBT is fairly intensive and access to these programs can be challenging. We have developed a guided self-help treatment which is based on FBT (gshFBT), and provides a self-help manual to parents and children along with guidance in the form of 20-minute check-in visits every other week. Our studies show that gshFBT is feasible and acceptable to families, decreases body weight in children and parents compared to a delayed treatment control, and that it produces similar weight losses compared to the more intensive FBT. However, all of our studies with gshFBT were conducted with children who were 85%BMI-98%BMI and to date, this method has not been tested with heavier children. Additionally, our pilot studies only included a 6-month follow-up timepoint and longer follow-up is needed. Thus, the objective of this study is to conduct a fully powered randomized controlled trial comparing gshFBT with FBT in children across the overweight and obese weight spectrum. We will recruit, randomize and treat 160 overweight/obese children and their parents and assess them at baseline, post-treatment, and 6- and 18-months follow-up. Primary and secondary aims are as follows. Primary Aim 1: Compare the effect of gshFBT and FBT on the target child's weight over the two years of the study. Primary Aim 2: Evaluate the cost effectiveness of gshFBT as compared to FBT. Secondary Aim 1: Determine the extent to which the gshFBT and FBT affects parent BMI, parenting skills, and parent and child physical activity and dietary intake. Additionally, as exploratory aims, we will evaluate moderators and mediators of gshFBT and FBT including executive functioning and parenting style. This application is a critical next step in the development of treatments for overweight and obese children, and could provide a treatment that is less intensive, less costly and has the potential to be provided to a larger proportion of the population."
"9207525","FINANCE DIVISION  PROJECT SUMMARY Background and Significance: The Finance Division?s role is to efficiently and accurately execute business transactions, ensure compliant funding administration, and coordinate all financial planning to effectively support the Center?s overall mission of conducting outstanding biomedical research directed towards significant human health issues and nonhuman primate health and biology. Key senior personnel within the Finance team are Eric Hoppe, BA, who is the Associate Director of Finance, Greg Yandl, BA, MBA who is the Finance Services Manager, Greg Tanner BA, JD, MBA who is the Business Services Manager, and Ann Schmidt, BS who is the Pre-Award Services Manager. Progress and Accomplishments: Finance Division: The current fiscal health of the Center is stable. Utilizing proactive cost containment has led to Center-wide control of P51 cost variance of less than 1% in FY53; FY54-55 are likely to be similarly well modeled. Our previous competing renewal cycle narrative (FY51- FY55) articulated that the Center had accumulated a significant operating deficit prior to FY46, and the Center addressed this deficit via a UW internal loan with a 20-year, zero-interest, principal- only repayment. As of FY54, we are currently in the 10th year of repayment. Currently, we are 3.5 years into our existing P51 cycle, and are seeing clear results with technology which has been leveraged for the automation of processes, thereby reducing process cycle times, reducing paper-intensive systems and manual processes, improving controls and data retrieval, and reducing process costs. These gains in greater efficiencies have allowed for improved services, with the same number of staff, despite increased workload and volumes. Finally, Finance has been reshaped into a smaller and more tightly focused unit than in previous competing renewal cycles: Human Resources, travel administration, and office supply inventory management has shifted to Center Programs, Administration & Operations (CPro); Center IT (ITS) is now in an independent reporting structure; capital project budgets are managed directly by Facilities & Planning (F&P); and the Director oversees research liaison activities. This re-scaling leverages the strengths of the other administrative divisions and allows Finance to focus on its core mission of efficient business transactions, compliance, and sound financial planning. Service Plan: Specific Aims: 1.) Ensure financial stability for the Center; 2.) Support our NHP colonies and science activities by refining current business processes to reduce costs and maximize efficiencies; 3.) Assist the Director to increase UW institutional support for the Center; 4.) Grow Non-P51 revenue streams; 5.) Facilitate internal collaboration with stakeholders across all divisions and NHP consortia members."
"9530303","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a basic science training grant focused on an integrative understanding of post- natal human behavioral development. The rationale for the focus on integrative training is that effective translation requires more than merely rapid movement of single-variable basic science findings to efficacy studies but a different basic science, one that embraces complex causal pathways of development, and considers processes at nested time scales and multiple levels of analysis. The training program focuses on behavioral development (and relations to brain development) because advancing research shows that post-natal behavior and experience modulates both structural and functional connectivity in the brain, tunes specialized neural systems and influences gene expression, with atypical patterns of early behavior and experiences determining the quality and opportunities of whole lifetimes. The trainees are 5 predoctoral candidates in psychology, cognitive science, and neuroscience and 3 postdoctoral fellows from various fields interested in developmental process. The training program for predoctoral trainees is 5 years (with 2 years supported by the training grant and 3 years by the participating PhD programs); the training program for postdoctoral trainees is typically 2 years. The training program emphasizes the use of cross-level methods to study the same problem, basic science that can link to translation, the collection and analysis of large data sets, open data and data sharing, and the ethical conduct of research."

"9260468","Project Summary/Abstract More than 40 million Americans currently take statins for the treatment or prevention of hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Statin therapy is not without risk. Complications include mild to moderate skeletal muscle adverse reactions, with reported incidence as high as 25%. In addition, statins have been shown to worsen insulin resistance and increase risk for type 2 diabetes. Disturbances in mitochondrial respiratory function have been implicated as a causal factor in these pathologies, but studies to test these potential links have not been conducted in human subjects undergoing statin therapy. Patients taking statins are also commonly advised to exercise regularly to further lower the risk for metabolic and cardiovascular disease. However, recent evidence suggests that statins can impair important exercise adaptations, and that this, again, may occur as a result of statins negatively impacting mitochondria in skeletal muscle. In summary, understanding how long-term statin therapy affects mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle is extremely important clinically, given the critical role skeletal muscle plays in maintaining metabolic and cardiovascular health. Therefore, the objectives of this application are to determine the impact of statin therapy on skeletal muscle mitochondrial function, cardiorespiratory fitness, and metabolism in humans. Aim 1 will use a longitudinal, repeated measures design to test impact of placebo, 20, and 80 mg/day of atorvastatin therapy on skeletal muscle mitochondrial function, insulin sensitivity, and cardiorespiratory fitness. Aim 2 will determine whether 20 and 80 mg/day of atorvastatin differentially blunt the mitochondrial, metabolic, and cardiorespiratory adaptations to aerobic exercise training. State-of- the-art human studies will be conducted in collaboration between two institutions and will include: comprehensive evaluation of mitochondrial function and content, insulin sensitivity, cardiovascular function, and cardiorespiratory fitness. These studies will provide mechanistic data on statin effects in- vivo and improve clinical knowledge of the cost-to-benefit ratio of statin therapy.  "
"9306898","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this ancillary study is to identify a target for intervention after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) that may decrease risk for recurrent cardiac events and mortality among patients who develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to the ACS. Approximately 12% of the nearly 2 million Americans who survive an ACS each year develop PTSD. Compared to ACS survivors who do not develop PTSD, those with PTSD have double the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events and mortality. The mechanisms underlying the association between ACS-induced PTSD and poor cardiovascular prognosis remain unknown. As a result, there is need for studies that assess mechanisms explaining the association between PTSD and prognosis. A hallmark of PTSD is avoidance of exposure to reminders of the traumatic event. This has led to the hypothesis that ACS-survivors with PTSD will poorly adhere to medications that serve as reminders of the traumatic cardiac event. In support of this hypothesis, we have shown that stroke survivors with PTSD are three times as likely to report being non-adherent to their medications. Yet, thus far, no one has assessed whether ACS-induced PTSD is associated with poor medication adherence. If ACS-induced PTSD results in poor adherence to cardioprotective medications, then medication adherence may represent an important target for improving prognosis in ACS-survivors with PTSD. The NHLBI-funded study Impact of Social-Interpersonal Factors in the ER on PTSD/Cardiac Outcomes provides a unique opportunity to test these hypotheses. This parent study will enroll a cohort of 1,741 ACS patients who initially present to the emergency room (ER) and are followed for 12 months to determine 1) which ER factors contribute to the development of PTSD after ACS and 2) the association between ACS- induced PTSD at 1 month and prognosis 1 year after the index ACS event. In this ancillary study, we propose to additionally measure adherence to aspirin in the six months after ACS using the gold-standard approach - electronic monitoring. We will also survey participants to understand why ACS-induced PTSD is associated with poor medication adherence. Finally, we will test whether the association between ACS-induced PTSD and ACS recurrence/mortality will be diminished after controlling for medication adherence. The results from this study will contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms by which ACS-induced PTSD leads to poor prognosis and will identify a specific target for interventions to improve prognosis in ACS survivors with PTSD."
"9483816","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Postpartum mood disorders (PMD) are the most common complication of childbirth and cause significant morbidity and mortality. Postpartum depression (PPD) has a prevalence of 10-15% and is the most frequent type of PMD. Postpartum psychosis (PP) is a rare but severe form of PMD that can result in tragic consequences including suicide and infanticide. The relationship between PPD and PP is uncertain, as is their relationship to major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BIP). PPD may or may not be a variant of MDD, and PP may or may not be a variant of BIP. We propose here a rigorous investigation of the epidemiology and genetic epidemiology of PPD and PP using Danish national population registers. Moreover, in contrast to BIP or schizophrenia, efforts to identify the genetic basis of MDD have been complicated by etiological heterogeneity, and genetic studies of PPD may advance these efforts, as PPD may be a more homogenous phenotype involving exposure to a similar biopsychosocial stressor. A robustly replicable finding in psychiatric genomics has been risk profile scores (RPS-polygene scores). There is now strong evidence that RPS measure genetic liability to a psychiatric disorder. We propose to add RPS to our evaluation of the epidemiology and genetic epidemiology of PPD and PP as a critical mechanistic element. The Danish registers form the basis of a longitudinal study of nearly all health care contacts since 1968 and include 4.5 million women plus data on their partners, family members, and offspring. Moreover, at no cost to this study, we will be able to use individual genotypes from a large cohort. We propose: (1) to conduct a cohort study of risk factors of PPD and PP in Danish national registers to examine pre-pregnancy, pregnancy/puerperal and postnatal risk factors, (2) assess the genetic epidemiology using the Danish registers to aggregate the populace into pedigrees and estimate a) familiarity of PPD and PP, b) familial coaggregation of PPD with PP, MDD and BIP in first-degree relatives as well as for PP with PPD, MDD, and BIP, and c) estimate heritability and environmentality (shared and individual-specific) of PPD and PP; and (3) perform a mechanistic assessment of PPD and PP using RPS to develop a predictive model of who will develop PPD and PP and longitudinal risk of recurrent MDD and BIP. PMD are a first rank public health problem. We currently have a poor understanding of who will develop PPD or PP, and whether and how the two disorders are related. We urgently need improved understanding of the epidemiology, genetic epidemiology, and mechanisms of PPD and PP. These unique Danish population data provide the necessary sample sizes and statistical power for comprehensive longitudinal studies relevant to the mechanisms underlying PMD. Successful completion of this proposal would provide new knowledge crucial to understanding the risk factors and course of PMD that could eventually also prove to be key to understanding the etiology of mood disorders outside the perinatal period."
"9318444","Project Summary/Abstract: Human Tissues Biobank Core Lack of access to validated, high quality human cells and tissues from well-characterized patients is one of the greatest barriers to carrying out human skin disease research. The Human Tissues Biobank Core addresses this unmet critical need, bringing together a set of unique and powerful resources that will allow skin disease investigators at any geographic location, affiliated with any institution, to gain access to highly validated, high quality human tissues with the goal of enabling and supporting high-quality translational human skin disease research. The Biobank Core allows access to 23,000 well characterized patients, their medical records, their genotyping results and the ability to call these patients back for further studies. Access is also provided to over 1.5 million banked pathologic specimens with the ability to access medical records with proper IRB approval. Living patients and pathologic specimens are both searchable by diagnosis and skin diseases are well represented. The Core also offers access to freshly excised human facial skin, abdominal skin and neonatal foreskin and to viable populations of purified cells obtained from human skin. Lastly, the core offers immunodeficient NSG mice grafted with human skin and blood. These mice allow study of living human skin in an accessible animal model and are useful for studying topical drug delivery, signaling in living human skin, T cell trafficking to skin, resident memory T cell generation, graft-versus-host disease and skin fibrosis. The Core also provides IRB protocol drafting and support as well as all services necessary for external investigators to utilize these resources. The Research Community potentially consists of any investigator at any institution who wishes to carry out human cell and tissue-based research. We provide 24 well-developed projects from investigators who wish to utilize Center services. 18 of these investigators would like to use the services of the Human Tissues Biobank Core. 14 of these investigators are from outside institutions, nine have never worked in human skin disease research before and seven have worked primarily in mouse models, with little or no prior work in humans. Eight of these projects are described in detail in this component and other projects are described fully in the two other Resource Core components of the application.

"9425179","As the population ages, the burden on individuals and society due to the cognitive and health effects of serious mental illnesses, such as bipolar disorder (BD), will increase. Premature and accelerated aging trajectories in BD are beginning to be recognized in many health and cognitive domains, but specific mechanisms have not yet been identified, particularly for the course of cognitive aging. Markers of inflammatory function, such as cytokine levels, are known to affect cognition, change with age, and predict declines in mentally healthy individuals. Cytokine levels also appear to be abnormal in those with BD, but mood instability in BD makes measurement of short- and long-term changes in both inflammatory and cognitive measures challenging. Nonetheless, studies within this population afford a unique opportunity to better understand how variations in the degree of emotional and behavioral dysregulation may moderate or mediate immune-cognitive associations. We propose to use an innovative multi-cohort burst longitudinal design (MBLD) to characterize trajectories of cognitive and inflammatory response and identify: 1) relationships between cognition and inflammation in the short term while accounting for effects of mood variability, 2) baseline measures and levels of short-term variability in inflammatory markers that might predict long-term trajectories of cognitive change, and 3) relationships between inflammatory, cognitive, and mood variables in the long-term (i.e., mechanisms of change). We will assess 144 adults (35-60 years old) with clinically-relevant symptoms of mood dysregulation, as indicated by Bipolar I diagnosis, and 115 similarly aged non-BD comparison (NC) participants without mental illnesses. Cognition, cytokine levels, and mood (along with other potential contributing variables) will be measured weekly or daily over a two week period using intensive remote monitoring and home visits (burst assessment). Burst assessments will be repeated annually (longitudinal assessment) for three years in the BD group, and at one year in the NC group. This project addresses NIMH Strategic Objective # 2: charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene. Specifically, using an innovative design that allows us to account for, and measure the impact of, variability in mood symptoms, we can discover inflammatory markers (both static and dynamic) that predict the course of cognitive change among individuals with mood instability. By understanding the complex and dynamic interplay between inflammation, cognition, and mood, pharmacologic and behavioral interventions can be designed to slow or reverse the trajectory of declining function in bipolar disorder."

"9313615","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mitochondria play an important role in numerous cellular processes and their function is maintained through a balance of fusion and fission. Disruptions in mitochondrial maintenance are associated with several pathologies including cancer. In tumor cells from patients with pancreatic cancer that harbor mutations in the KRAS gene, the mitochondria exhibit a short, fragmented phenotype, characteristic of increased fission. The goal of this study is to investigate how the induction of mitochondrial fission downstream of Ras leads to physiological changes in cells that result in tumor growth. The research component of this project proposes to use an in vitro and tissue culture approach to investigate the cellular processes that are regulated upon activation or inhibition of mitochondrial fission in the context of activated Ras in pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, we aim to utilize both a genetic and a pharmacological approach to confirm the specificity of this regulation. We will test the hypothesis that Ras-induced mitochondrial fission causes changes in cell growth and survival (Aim 1), and metabolism and mitophagy (Aim 2) in order to drive tumor growth. Ultimately, this research project sets out to delineate novel therapeutic targets from a critical up-and-coming node of regulation in Ras-driven tumorigenesis. The research project proposed will be carried out in conjunction with a rigorous training plan composed of the following: 1) integrative coursework and interactive training 2) participation in research meetings and seminars 3) participation in scientific conferences 4) professional development and 5) community outreach. The combination of proposed research along with an active training plan will yield meaningful contributions to the field as well as a sound basis on which to excel as a versatile and productive cancer researcher."
"9350322","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a major source of morbidity and mortality. Both the incidence and prevalence of ESRD secondary to diabetes continue to rise. In the United States, over 30% of patients receiving either dialysis therapy or renal transplantation have ESRD as a result of diabetic nephropathy, and more than 40% of the incident cases of ESRD are attributable to diabetes. Given the global epidemic of obesity in developed countries, an increasing incidence of DN is being widely reported. The underlying pathogenic mechanisms mediating development and progression of human DN are still not well understood. Specifically, there is still incomplete understanding of the nature and etiology of altered protein, lipid and metabolite expression in both the glomerular and tubulointerstitial compartments during the course of human DN, and the spectrum of lesions in patients with diabetes who do not have classic or overt DN is not established because patients do not routinely undergo renal biopsy. To address these gaps in knowledge, we have assembled a team of established and experienced investigators with complementary expertise and a novel set of resources in order to investigate human DN. We will use histology-directed MALDI Imaging Mass Spectrometry (MALDI IMS), a novel imaging technology that has been validated in our preliminary studies of mouse renal tissues, to mine and phenotype proteomic, lipidomic and metabolomic changes in human DN in order to map the molecular profile of lesions that may be attributable to diabetes or to other unrecognized abnormalities in diabetic patients. We will obtain human kidney samples from a cohort of patients pre-consented for DNA analysis and linked to a de-identified electronic medical record (Synthetic Derivative, SD) and DNA samples (BioVU). Validation of a detailed phenotype of patients with existing diabetic nephropathy that continues to be updated in real time will allow detailed prospective mining of such samples. The specific aims of the study are: 1) To create a human kidney tissue biorepository linked to a de-identified electronic medical record in order to facilitate studies of human diabetic nephropathy and other kidney diseases; 2) To determine protein, lipid, and metabolite profiles in distinct nephron segments and cell types in the human diabetic kidney using MALDI IMS and integrate the results with light and electron microscopic findings; 3) To integrate protein, lipid, and metabolite information in the diabetic glomerulus with phenotype and genotype data in order to identify specific molecular changes associated with development or progression of diabetic nephropathy; and 4) To determine potential therapeutic targets by exploring molecular mechanisms underlying the identified changes in proteins, lipids and metabolites occurring in the course of human diabetic nephropathy Our overall goal for these studies is to define the molecular basis for human diabetic nephropathy and to identify potential targets for therapy by utilizing new and powerful modalities: MALDI IMS combined with conventional microscopy and a human renal tissue biorepository linked to both a synthetic medical record and the patients' DNA."

While global efforts have led to an appreciable decrease in malaria incidence and mortality over the past few decades, cerebral malaria (CM) remains a devastating complication of severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria and is responsible for many of the malaria-associated deaths. There is currently a paucity of supplemental treatment options that have been shown to prevent or improve the outcome of cerebral malaria in particular. In order to improve CM disease treatment, it is necessary to better understand the underlying immunological causes of the disease. We propose to define the role of the receptor EphA2 in the development of cerebral malaria and determine its contribution to T cell sequestration and blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown in the context of malaria. The proposed research is highly innovative in that the role of EphA2 in malaria has never been described. The overall objective of this proposal is to determine the mechanism(s) by which EphA2 leads to CD8+ T cell sequestration and BBB breakdown during experimental cerebral malaria (ECM). We hypothesize that EphA2 functions as an adherence molecule for ephrin A ligand-expressing CD8+ T cells leading to CD8+ T cell sequestration on the brain endothelium and subsequent breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. To test this hypothesis, in Specific Aim 1 we will demonstrate the requirement for endothelial-expressed EphA2 in mediating CD8+ T cell retention in the brain during ECM. Using the ECM-inducing parasite strain Plasmodium berghei ANKA, we will demonstrate the requirement of EphA2 on the brain endothelium in CD8+ T cell retention through infections of bone marrow chimeras using EphA2-/- and EphA2+/+ mice. We will further determine if targeting ephrin A ligands on CD8+ T cells is a viable therapeutic strategy for preventing ECM. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine the contribution of EphA2 to BBB breakdown during ECM. We will assess the effect of blocking EphA2 activation on ECM-associated vascular leakage in the brain using a highly specific small molecule inhibitor of EphA2. We will further determine if targeting EphA2 on endothelial cells is a viable therapeutic strategy for preventing ECM. We are uniquely positioned to address these issues due to the expertise of the sponsor and co-sponsor in parasite immunology and brain immunopathology, respectively. Our long-term goal is to understand how EphA2 functions in ECM development in order to apply this information to cerebral malaria in humans and determine the suitability of EphA2 as a target for a novel adjunctive therapy for cerebral malaria. The proposed research has strong potential to significantly contribute to the understanding and cerebral malaria immunopathology and inform design of rational cerebral malaria therapeutics. Cerebral malaria remains a significant cause of mortality globally, and the identification of new targets and therapeutics to combat this severe disease manifestation is an urgent public health issue addressed by this proposal."
"9328226","Abstract The role of adipocytes in melanoma The successful growth of primary tumors and establishment of metastases relies heavily on the suitability of the tumor microenvironment. Adipocytes constitute a major portion of the melanoma TME in several cancer types but their contribution to tumor progression is poorly understood. Here, we use an in vivo zebrafish melanoma transplantation model and a co-culture system to investigate the cross-talk between adipocytes and melanoma. In fish, melanoma cells often in subcutaneous sites show a 50% increase in lipid content compared to parental cells. This is accompanied by upregulation of the long chain fatty acid (LCFA) fatty acid transporter proteins FATP2 and FATP6 and down regulation of lipid synthesis genes, suggesting that the increase in lipids is derived from exogenous uptake from the surrounding microenvironment. These data suggest that TME adipocytes can provide lipids to tumor cells. Consistent with this, fish and human melanoma cells co-cultured with 3T3-L1 adipocytes also have increased lipid content, and fluorescently labeled fatty acids can be transferred directly from adipocytes to melanoma cells. Moreover, co-culture with adipocytes makes melanoma cells more invasive and proliferative. Lipid uptake by melanoma cells can be blocked with lipofermata, a small molecule inhibitor of the FATP fatty acid transporters. Strikingly, lipofermata also has a profound anti-proliferative effect on both human and zebrafish melanoma cells. Taken together, these data suggest that TME adipocytes play an important role in melanoma growth, acting as a rich source of lipids for melanoma, and that uptake of these lipids is mediated by the FATP fatty-acid transport proteins. The goal of the proposed research is to test the hypothesis that adipocytes in the microenvironment aid in melanoma progression and metastases. To do so, we aim to elucidate how melanoma cells influence adipocytes and vice versa. First, we will characterize the identify pathways and genes important in mediating increased invasion and proliferation in cocultured tumor cells with gene expression analysis. Moreover, we will determine whether adipocytes mediate metabolic reprogramming in melanoma cells, and test whether these phenotypic changes depend on lipid uptake via FATP proteins. We will also use a transgenic zebrafish line with adipocyte-specific expression of tdTomato-nitroreductase for imaging and isolation of adipocytes after tumor cell transplantation. Fish will imaged live to characterize changes in adipocyte morphology in response to tumor burden. Further, adipocytes will be isolated via FACS to characterize gene expression changes. Finally, adipocytes will be inducibly ablated using the NTR/metronidazole system in the melanoma transplanted fish to functionally test the role of adipocytes in melanoma growth and metastases. Ultimately, we wish to identify clinically targetable pathways of cross-talk between adipocytes and melanoma cells, which represents a novel form of microenvironmental therapy for the treatment of melanoma."
"9328199","Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are a common therapy utilized in hospitals, with ~15 million RBC units administered annually in the United States. RBC transfusions are associated with multiple adverse effects, including an increased risk for bacterial infection. Before transfusion, donor RBCs are refrigerator-stored for up to 42 days, as established by FDA criteria. During storage, RBCs undergo multiple structural and metabolic alterations, collectively known as ?the storage lesion.? As a result, some storage-damaged RBCs are rapidly cleared from the circulation post-transfusion, a process mediated predominantly by phagocytic cells in the spleen and liver (i.e., ?extravascular hemolysis?). Although several studies were designed to observe the incidence of adverse effects following transfusions of stored RBCs, very little is known about the underlying mechanisms causing these adverse effects. Therefore, to identify potential mechanisms, we will use a novel mouse model of RBC storage and clearance. Our Laboratory has successfully used this model previously and observed that mice are more susceptible to bacterial infection following transfusions of storage-damaged RBCs, which are cleared by extravascular hemolysis. Therefore, we believe that mouse models offer tremendous potential for achieving the overall aim of this project, which is to investigate the mechanism(s) by which hemolysis leads to an increased risk of bacterial infections, with our overall hypothesis being that robust erythrophagocytosis by macrophages impairs bacterial phagocytosis during a subsequent infection."

(NEI R01 funded labs are given priority in all these activities.) Core equipment includes two ceiling hung Zeiss operating microscopes that hang from flotation devices in HEPA filtered surgical suites. One of the microscopes is equipped for recording video of the surgeries. There is an animal vital sign monitoring device that records blood pressure, heart beat and tissue oxygen. There is a Harvard micro-injector that is used in many of the surgeries. The imaging suite includes a LKC BigShot Color LED Ganzfeld Stimulator, a Bioptigen SDOCT, and a Micron III imaging system. Additional equipment includes slit lamp cameras and Zeiss fundus cameras. Imran Bhutto, M.D., Ph.D., the key person in this module, expends 24% of his effort in maintaining the ORs and imaging equipment and in training personnel. He is a skilled vitreo-retinal surgeon with a PhD. In pathology. He supervises the Wilmer/Woods Animal Colony's animal operating rooms, the imaging room, the surgical preparation areas, as well as the digital calendar used to schedule these rooms. Dr. Bhutto signs off on all personnel receiving approval to enter the colony and secondarily to enter and work in the OR's. He oversees the quality of care in the colony and, as administrator, reprimands investigators not using the colony and its specialty rooms properly. Training by Dr. Bhutto on the proper utilization of the ceiling hung Zeiss operating microscopes as well as the large animal anesthesia machines and the micro-injector is required before any investigator is permitted to use them. Dr. Bhutto is available to train Investigators in ocular surgery techniques such as anesthesia, intravitreal injection, subretinal injection, and postoperative care. He is also available to assist new investigators in writing animal protocols and submission to the ACUC. Dr. Bhutto does not manage the breeding or care of the animals, as this is the purview of the Hopkins Division of Comparative Medicine. They provide care and veterinarians for all of the animals in the colony.    They assist Investigators in breeding animals and making investigators aware of ill animals or improper caging.

"9273552","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the sudden death of an infant that remains unexplained after a complete review of the history, autopsy, and death scene investigation; it is the leading cause of postneonatal infant mortality in  the United States today. Based upon our findings to date, we hypothesize that SIDS is due to an underlying abnormality in the medullary homeostatic network that: 1) results in a failure of protective responses to life-threatening stressors during sleep in a critical developmental period;  and 2) importantly involves serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), y-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and their potential interactions with other neurotransmitter systems and the signal transduction family 14-3-3. Initiated in 1998, our program brings together a highly committed group of 23 investigators and their trainees to address the potential role of the brain in SIDS. Located at 3 medical institutions across the country and the medical examiner's system in San Diego, CA, we bring to bear upon the SIDS problem outstanding expertise     in multiple clinical and scientific disciplines in 3 integrated projects and 2 cores (Administrativ and     Neuroanatomy). The 7 inter-related themes proposed for investigation with state-of-the-art methodologies in the next (fourth) cycle are: 1) gene expression profiles of the medullary homeostatic network in SIDS infants and animal models (Projects I and II; 2) the interaction of prenatal exposures (hypoxia and nicotine) with preexisting 5-HT dysfunction that potentially leads to homeostatic impairment in the postnatal period (Projects II and III); 3) the mechanism(s) of physiological derangements in protective homeostatic responses related to 5-HT and GABA, including autoresuscitation, arousal, and the laryngeal chemoreflex (Projects II and III); 4) the development and connectivity of subtypes of brainstem 5-HT neurons related to different homeostatic functions (Projects III); 5) a potential link between abnormalities in the caudal/rostral 5-HT domains of the brainstem and hippocampal targets in SIDS brains (Project I); 6) treatment of abnormalities in animal models with specific drugs (Project II); and 7) the development of future biomarkers of brainstem pathology in SIDS infants."
"9464834","?    DESCRIPTION: Scientific advances in HIV treatment have demonstrated that immediate access to combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) provides both individual and public health benefits. With sufficient uptake of ART, HIV-related morbidity, mortality and transmission can be drastically reduced at the population-level. As a result, the focus of global HIV control strategie have turned towards efforts to 'seek, test, treat and retain' people living with HIV (PLHIV) in ART.  Emerging research on the cascade of HIV care, a simple metric tracking numbers of individuals infected, diagnosed, on ART and virally suppressed, has made clear that the control of the HIV epidemic hinges on the performance of health care systems in reaching and delivering care to PLHIV. Yet, as a surveillance tool, it provides an incomplete and possibly misleading basis for decisions on how to allocate funding.  The US HIV epidemic is a diverse set of microepidemics, dispersed primarily across large urban centers with different underlying epidemiological and structural conditions. These disparate underlying conditions require localized strategies to optimize the HIV care cascade. Changes over time in these microepidemics, as well as in evidence on how to improve HIV testing and care, challenges our ability to make informed and timely decisions that result in the greatest health benefits for the resources invested in treating and preventing HIV.  We propose a novel economic modeling framework to revolutionize HIV surveillance. This framework would ensure scarce resources are focused on interventions that can provide the greatest value for money in a given microepidemic. We will build upon a validated economic model to produce rapid, automated evidence synthesis, focusing on minimal data requirements to update the model, and integrate findings from emerging results of public health interventions into real-time disease surveillance systems.  Experimental and observational studies of interventions to improve HIV testing and ART engagement have demonstrated their effectiveness in generalized and targeted populations, yet they are vastly underused in practice. Structural interventions for people who inject drugs (PWID), such as needle exchange and opioid agonist therapy (OAT), have proven incredibly valuable in jurisdictions with low barriers to these services, resulting in staggering declines in HIV incidence and disease burden. We hypothesize that a unique mix of these interventions will provide the best value for money in each micro epidemic, and that the optimal combinations will change over time according to underlying epidemic trends and the state of scientific advancement in HIV intervention research.  We will demonstrate our approach for six distinct urban settings in the US with disparate structural conditions, substance use patterns, and HIV epidemics. This project is an innovative translational research initiative that will enhance surveillance efforts and increase the impact of interventional research in HIV and substance use disorders."
"9316585","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the course of their lives the average American will undergo nearly nine surgical procedures, many related to diseases of the digestive track or conditions associated with obesity. Despite being some of the most commonly performed interventions, most of these procedures have not been subjected to rigorous scientific evaluation. For almost all of these procedures, fundamental questions regarding surgical epidemiology, clinical effectiveness, best practices to accomplish best outcomes, population-level results, patient-reported perspectives, and cost considerations have yet to be addressed. As healthcare delivery is reformed and as we strive towards building a learning healthcare system, addressing these questions is critical. One reason for the shortfall in rigorous clinical research in surgery is a paucity of formal, health services and comparative effectiveness research training for surgeons. To address this need, we propose the continuation and expansion of the University of Washington's National Research Service Award (NRSA) fellowship in clinical, health services, comparative effectiveness and patient-centered outcomes research for surgeons. This fellowship involves didactic training and practical experience in advanced research methodology focused on interventions related to the gastrointestinal system, obesity, and obesity-associated conditions. The training is focused in 6 areas (research using observational data, patient-centered outcome and preference assessment, health economics and behavioral economics in healthcare, policy and implementation science research, clinical / translational research, and research operations management) and is intended to develop surgeon- scholars who will be successful scientists and help build and advance the goals of a learning healthcare system. The didactic component of this fellowship includes coursework that results in a Masters of Public Health (MPH) or Masters in Science (MS) degree through the University of Washington School of Public Health and Community Medicine, with additional coursework and certificate training in the PhD candidate-training program of the Departments of Health Services and Pharmacy. All trainees complete a set of projects and studies representing a wide spectrum of research methods and approaches. The trainee's experience is fostered by a structured mentorship program with seasoned investigators who have a career commitment to training and career success in high-level research and integrating evidence into practice change. The T32 Fellows also participate in unique community, regional and national learning healthcare system programs including Washington State's Comparative Effectiveness Research Translation Network (CERTAIN),3 the Surgical Care and Outcomes Assessment Program (SCOAP)4 and a program aimed at optimizing patients before hospitalization called Strong for Surgery (strongforsurgery.org). Trainees participate in the NRSA fellowship for two years and then serve an additional 5-7 years of additional postdoctoral clinical training as general or specialty surgeons in the fields of advanced laparoscopy, foregut, hepatobiliary, colorectal, or bariatric surgery before obtaining academic faculty positions. The current NRSA fellowship program supports one new trainee per year, and because of program success, mentor capacity and trainee demand we are requesting an expansion to two new trainees per year."
"9491382","The establishment and maintenance of spiral ganglion neuron (SGN) connections with hair cells in the  cochlea is critical to auditory function, and the disruption of these connections is both a well-recognized  consequence of sensorineural hearing loss, and a cause of diminished cochlear implant performance.  Despite the importance of these connections, the mechanisms required for SGN axon guidance and  synaptogenesis are largely unknown. The long-term goal of this research is to define the mechanisms  responsible for auditory nervous system development, so that improved therapies can be developed to treat  hearing loss in humans. The results from the research outlined in this application will define how class-3  Semaphorins (Sema3s), a large family of secreted factors that activate Neuropilin/Plexin (Nrp/Plxn) coreceptors  on growing axons, are essential for SGN axon guidance decisions. Conceptually, the proposed  research is innovative because it will provide the first in-depth analysis of hearing loss caused by SGN axon  guidance defects, as there is little known about how the elaboration of SGN fibers within the cochlear duct  con-elates with audiological assessments. The proposed research is technically innovative because a mouse  model that allows the labeling, visualization and analyses of SGN-hair cell interactions in real time will be  used. The function of specific class-3 Semaphorins that are expressed in the cochlea will be defined. Gain-of-function adenovirus infection experiments, and loss-of-function mouse models, will be used to test the  hypothesis that Sema3C attracts SGNs and that Sema3A sorts different populations of SGNs. In order to  transmit a signal intracellularly, Nrps must bind to Plexin co-receptors. Distinct populations of SGNs  differentially express PlexinA3, thus the function of PlexlnA3 will be determined. Using pharmacology, mouse  models, and protein truncation experiments, the hypothesis that PlexinA3 activation in different populations  of SGNs targets them to specific populations of hair cells will be tested. This contribution of this research will  be significant because it will define one of the first molecular signaling pathways to contribute to the  development of the complex afferent innervation pattern within the mammalian auditory system."
"9401978","Project Summary Mild traumatic brain injury is the most common form of impact and is prevalent among contact sports athletes and military personnel. Repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (rmTBI) can generate several molecular cascades that lead to neuropathological consequences in the brain. Moreover, rmTBI has been correlated to neurodegenerative diseases such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). CTE is a slow, progressive tauopathy that exhibits neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in brain accompanied by psychiatric and cognitive manifestations. NFTs are aggregates formed from the misfolding and aggregation process of tau protein and are canonical in tauopathies such as CTE and Alzheimer?s disease (AD), among others. Individuals following a TBI event can demonstrate early tau accumulation, independent of age, suggesting a potential pathological link between TBI and disease. Formation of amyloids, such as NFTs from tau, is proposed to follow a nucleation-polymerization model where a misfolded seed can trigger native proteins to misfold and aggregate. Introducing a pre-formed seed can accelerate this reaction. The development of tau inclusions and effect on clinical symptoms in connection to rmTBI remain to be elucidated; moreover, effective diagnostic methods for TBI and tau pathology are lacking. This proposal aims to determine the effect of rmTBI on tau pathology along with psychiatric and cognitive sequelae and exploit this misfolded tau for diagnostic assessment in brain and biological fluids by a novel, sensitive assay called tau-protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA). These experiments intend to explore the role of rmTBI, mimicking sub-concussive impacts in athletes, in vivo in contributing to tau pathology and determine if early formed rmTBI-induced tau aggregates have seeding capabilities. Tau-PMCA will be utilized to detect the initiation of tau seeds in brain and biological fluids, such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood plasma, triggered by rmTBI in mice as well as connecting the neurobehavioral changes over time. Finally, in a translational approach, tau-PMCA will be used to determine the formation of the first tau seeds in CSF and blood plasma from TBI and AD cases as a diagnostic tool. This proposal conveys the mission of the NIH by advancing science and advocating the establishment of a promising diagnostic strategy. Overall, this proposal will ameliorate the understanding of rmTBI in relation to tau pathology and behavior and potentially detecting disease onset for therapeutic strategies in the future."
"9356591","Developing enhanced methods for reporting and manipulating brain activity is a major focus of the BRAIN Initiative. A major aspect of these efforts is aimed at developing genetically encoded probes for large-scale sensing and/or manipulation of neural activity in vivo. Major advances have been made in developing probes with enhanced intrinsic properties as to efficacy of reporting and/or manipulating neural activity. However, the utility of these probes in vivo has been limited by an inability to direct their localization to specific subcellular sites in brain neurons. We propose to develop a pipeline of genetically encoded localization modules or GELMs to direct probes for large-scale sensing and/or manipulation of neural activity to specific subcellular sites in brain neurons in vivo. This will yield enhanced signal to noise ratio at any specific site, and allows researchers and clinicians to more effectively report and/or modulate neuronal activity, an important step towards developing new ways to treat, cure, and even prevent brain disorders. An interdisciplinary consortium comprising neurobiologists, binder developers, and neural activity probe developers assembled here proposes development of a very ambitious pipeline for development of a robust and diverse set of genetically encoded localization modules, or GELMs, that when fused to activity reporters and modulators, or ARMs, will lead to the localization and concentration of the fusion proteins at specific subcellular sites in neurons. The ability to effectively and reliably target ARMs, and other genetically encoded probes, to specific subcellular sites in brain neurons in vivo will transform the methodology for large-scale sensing and/or manipulation of neural. The novel high-throughput pipeline for GELM development is based on a convergence of powerful new methods. The first is advances in developing high affinity, specific binders for neuronal target proteins in a format that can be used as intrabodies within neurons. These will be developed into Intrabody-based GELMs or I-GELMs. The pipeline also takes advantage of emerging data on targeting motifs present in otherwise highly related proteins that exhibit highly specific yet distinct subcellular localizations in brain neurons, and that affords an opportunity to develop Targeting motif-based GELMs or T-GELMs based on these motifs. We take advantage of high throughput systems for evaluating the expression, localization and function of GELM-ARM fusions in brain neurons. Lastly, we will make GELMs and GELM-ARM fusions widely available through open source plasmid repositories."
"9391904","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tumor-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have received little attention in central nervous system (CNS) malignancies, in part because the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the neurovascular unit (NVU) create two compartments and limit brain delivery. Rituximab anti-CD20 mAb improves survival in a rat model of CNS B-cell lymphoma and in patients with primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL), but trastuzumab anti-HER2 mAb has been ineffective in the treatment of breast cancer brain metastases. In this revised application we propose to evaluate mechanisms to enhance the delivery and efficacy of mAb-based therapies in two-compartment models of CNS tumors using permeability, tumor volumetrics and survival as end points. We will assess the permeability of rat brain tumor models using tumor-specific mAbs conjugated to ferumoxytol iron oxide nanoparticles, in comparison to dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of vasculature and quantitative autoradiography of drug delivery. We hypothesize that due to the long plasma half-life of therapeutic mAbs and their ability to bind to and accumulate at the target cancer cells, even a modest change in NVU function may impact delivery and efficacy of these agents. We will use osmotic BBB disruption to induce transient physical opening of the BBB. Targeting vascular endothelial growth factor with the antiangiogenic mAb bevacizumab paradoxically decreases vascular permeability while enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy and mAbs. Targeting cell-cell adhesion and interactions with the extracellular matrix in the NVU with the anti-?v integrin mAb intetumumab can increase tumor vascular permeability. Aim 1 is directed toward improving the efficacy of rituximab in a human B-cell CNS lymphoma model. We will image vascular permeability and test whether route of administration or vascular modification enhances the delivery and efficacy of rituximab with or without chemotherapy in intracerebral lymphoma xenografts. Additionally, we will evaluate the impact of rituximab on the seeding of B- cell lymphoma to the CNS from the periphery in a hematogenous model. In Aim 2 we will optimize the efficacy of trastuzumab and the ADC trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) in breast cancer intracerebral xenografts and hematogenous metastases. We will assess the effects of vascular targeting on vessel permeability, mAb delivery and T-DM1 efficacy. In Aim 3 we will develop and initiate an innovative trial of maintenance rituximab in PCNSL patients who achieve complete response after first-line and recurrent therapies, which will test mechanisms of recurrence. We will continue a Phase II trial of rituximab in conjunction with BBB disruption chemotherapy, and document and characterize neurocognitive function in PCNSL patients who have survived 2+ years in complete response after rituximab. This revised renewal will show the impact of transvascular delivery and the NVU in a rare primary brain tumor using mAb and drug conjugate approaches, and will extend and translate this approach to the more common problem of CNS breast cancer brain metastases."

"9402967","Summary: In spite of progress in understanding the pathophysiology of OA, there remain no definitive non-surgical treatment options. Further, tissue engineering strategies designed to produce cartilage-mimetic materials have seen only limited success; a significant impediment is the inability to fully assess the molecular structure of developing tissue such that optimal constructs for implantation can be identified. Recently, we demonstrated that the technique of non-destructive near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) analysis can be utilized to assess the primary molecular components of native and engineered cartilage. NIRS data correlates strongly to water and matrix content (collagen and proteoglycan) in these tissues, and to mechanical properties. Having validated the NIR technology for cartilage assessment, we propose to extend our studies to address an important emerging area of musculoskeletal tissue engineering, identification of individual constructs suitable for clinical implantation. These studies are based on the principle that increases in construct maturation prior to implantation can be utilized to predict in vivo success. We hypothesize that maturation of the cartilaginous matrix can be monitored by NIRS, and that the spectral data can be used as a predictor of clinical success. We will address this in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies that evaluate construct development using NIRS analysis. A cell-seeded hyaluronic acid (HA) scaffold, previously shown to be effective at promoting matrix production and the development of functional material properties, will serve as the model system for implantation into a porcine model of cartilage repair. The proposed NIRS technology would establish a novel, non-destructive modality for pre-implantation evaluation of developing engineered tissues for clinical implantation. There are currently no minimally-invasive methods available for the clinical assessment of cartilage repair tissue maturation based on molecular signatures. The development of clinically-relevant optical methods to evaluate full-depth composition of tissues in a large animal model will provide a strong underpinning for translation of this technique into the clinical setting. Such analyses would also represent a fundamentally new and powerful approach for evaluating and guiding cartilage therapeutics. The possibility of one non-destructive modality that can be used in vitro during laboratory experiments of developing tissues to assess composition and identify constructs for implantation, as well as after the constructs are implanted clinically, would indeed be a powerful technique that could play a central role in the regenerative medicine field."
"9288212","  Project Abstract Uncontrolled bleeding represents a significant clinical challenge in general surgery, trauma, and emergency medicine. Exsanguination (bleeding) is the major cause of death from traumatic injury (~ 40%) and bleeding following invasive surgeries such as cardiopulmonary bypass is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. During the normal clotting cascade, the protease thrombin is activated, which in turn activates dormant circulating platelets and the clotting protein precursor, fibrinogen. Activated platelets form a hemostatic plug at the site of injury, stemming blood loss. Platelets are sufficient to achieve short-term hemostasis and are critical to the maturation of stable fibrin-based clots via their activity in fibrin recruitment and clot contraction. Thus, it is not surprising that their massive dilution during hemorrhage or active inhibition during surgery results in a failure of the clotting system. Current hemostasis technologies include topical sealants, exothermic zeolites and recombinant clotting factors. Each of these approaches has demonstrated modest successes, yet all have significant drawbacks such as a lack of wound specificity; none are as ?evolved? as the natural wound-responsive hemostasis system. Thus, more recent efforts have focused on creation of synthetic analogs of platelets. The vital platelet functions that one would like to recapitulate include injury-triggered enhancement of fibrin clot formation and clot contraction/stabilization. To date, artificial platelet approaches only recapitulate clot/platelet binding in a non-triggered (i.e. constitutive) and non-specific fashion and lack the other critical platelet functions. Here we propose a novel and simple approach to the creation of platelet-like structures through the application of synthetic biology. We are proposing two aims. The first aim is to understand how our platelet-like particles interact with various stages of the coagulation cascade and to understand the fundamental mechanism of action of our platelet-like particles in augmenting hemostasis. The second aim is to explore the in vivo function of the platelet-like particles, specifically in the augmentation of hemostasis in multiple models of trauma-associated coagulopathy.  "
"9279197","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term goal of the proposed research is the effective implementation of residual limb volume management strategies on prosthesis users so as to enhance their clinical outcomes, health, and quality-of- life. The focus of this application s to uncover knowledge essential to accomplishing this goal. The specific aims of the proposed research are to determine the influence of different activities and accommodation strategies on residual limb diurnal fluid volume change, and how they relate to comfort and performance of individuals with trans-tibial amputation. An additional goal is to create and evaluate a novel accommodation solution for people who are prescribed, but choose not to use, residual limb volume management strategies, such as changing prosthetic sock ply. To accomplish the aims, a novel multi-channel bioimpedance analysis instrument developed in the previous funding cycle is used to assess diurnal fluid volume changes in the residual limbs of a group of trans-tibial (i.e., below-knee) prosthesis users. Clinical outcomes, including socket comfort, satisfaction, and perceived mobility are obtained using self-report measures, while percent time weight-bearing and use of accommodation strategies are measured with custom instrumentation. It is expected that limb volume change negatively correlates with user satisfaction, comfort, and mobility, and that use of volume accommodation strategies, such as sock addition and intermittent doffing (i.e., removing the socket) enhances these outcomes. A novel management alternative we introduce for people who require, but choose not to use volume management strategies, is a timely release of socket pressures at key locations on the limb so as to augment limb fluid volume recovery. This strategy, informed by the results of the proposed research, is expected to be equally or more effective than sock accommodation towards enhancing outcomes. The relevance of the proposed application to public health is better understanding of how residual limb fluid volume changes impact users' experience with a prosthesis, clinically-important outcomes related to residual limb health, and users' performance in life activities. Currently, it is unknown where within the residual limb fluid volume changes occur or how much change can be tolerated without negatively affecting prosthetic fit. Beyond the grant period, it is anticipated the proposed research will be extended into clinical tools that allow practitioners to isolate limb fluid volume change problems from other issues such as improper componentry or alignment. Potentially, the efforts described here can be extended to other areas where devices require a secure and intimate fit with human tissues, including trans-fermoral prosthetics, upper-limb prosthetics, and orthotics."
"9307816","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to prepare trainees for research careers with significant impact in the field of mechanobiology by providing rigorous and coherent training that crosses disciplines and length scales. The importance of mechanical force in biology at many length scales has become increasingly clear in recent years. Cells sense and respond to the mechanical properties of their microenvironment. These mechanical properties guide cell motility, determine cytoskeletal structure, and control differentiation and gene expression. At the nanometer scale, force affects molecular configuration, and vice versa; motor proteins interact with cytoskeletal components to produce contraction or to transport cargo. Forces generated by actin polymerization drive cell migration and protrusion. In each of these examples, a biochemical process produces force, but force may also affect the underlying biochemistry. These complex, coupled interactions are important in clinical and translational science, as subcellular and cellular phenomena determine the macroscopic behavior of tissues and organs, anatomy and morphology. Conversely, as an animal or plant interacts with its macroscopic environment, its structure and mechanical properties at longer length scales affect how forces are transmitted to cells and their components. The MBnc training program will exploit Washington University's strong base of faculty and resources in these areas. It will provide pre-doctoral trainees with fundamental coursework in both biology and mechanics, and research training at the intersection of these disciplines. Support for six trainees per year is requested. Each trainee will be supported for two years, typically the third and fourth year of graduate study. Trainees who participate in this program will be prepared to perform advanced interdisciplinary research on the role of mechanics in biology across length scales, and will thus fill an important and growing need in the scientific community."
"9284479","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anesthesiology's success in making the intraoperative environment an extremely safe place, an accomplishment now recognized and emulated by other specialties, should not obscure the fact that important fundamental questions about the entire perioperative experience remain unanswered. These questions include 1) the mechanism of general anesthetic action, 2) systems biology of the perioperative state, 3) the mechanism and prevention of postoperative delirium and cognitive dysfunction, 4) potential toxicity of the anesthetics 5) how to increase safety by applying best practices and effective communication throughout the perioperative period, 6) how to improve long-term outcomes that may relate to the perioperative period, 7) organ failure in critical care, and 8) the mechanism and treatment of acute and chronic pain. However, maintaining the scientific infrastructure that will guide Anesthesiology into the future requires a core of well-trained and motivated Physician-Scientists within the specialty who are dedicated to the pursuit of problems important to the field. To help ensure a scientifically robust future for Anesthesiology, the Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine (ACCM) at the Johns Hopkins University is submitting this renewal application to continue support of Postdoctoral Research Training in Anesthesiology. In addition to providing a critical avenue for the support of Trainees, it is anticipated that this program will continue to refine the approach whereby Johns Hopkins ACCM recruits, trains, and develops the next generation of Physician- Scientists in the specialty of Anesthesiology. ACCM has a long and productive history of clinical and basic research training in Anesthesiology, which this Training Program will continue to build upon and formalize. This expectation is now being realized with the outstanding past and current Trainees supported by the Training Program. When combined with the considerable resources already in place for faculty development within ACCM and at Johns Hopkins University, this Anesthesiology Postdoctoral Research Training grant will continue to provide an outstanding opportunity for training Physician-Scientists who will continue to build the scientific foundation for the practiceof Anesthesiology."
"9302685","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There exists a well-established relationship between smoking and depressive symptomatology. The problem of relapse continues to plague public health efforts to reduce the prevalence of cigarette smoking among smokers with elevated depressive symptoms. Intervening to increase aerobic exercise among smokers with elevated depressive symptoms represents one potentially efficacious approach for it may directly influence cessation outcomes and have ancillary physical and mental health benefits in this population. In a small pilot trial (K23 DA019950; PI Ana Abrantes, PhD), we demonstrated that the subgroup of smokers with elevated depressive symptoms who participated in the exercise condition (relative to the health education contact control) had higher abstinence rates at end of treatment and up to the 12-month follow-up. In addition, participants in the exercise condition also demonstrated significantly lower negative affect related withdrawal symptoms as well as depressive symptoms in the early weeks of smoking cessation. This preliminary work is the first study to demonstrate that an at-risk group of smokers with elevated depressive symptoms could uniquely benefit from exercise while quitting smoking. We propose to conduct a randomized, controlled trial with 250 smokers with currently elevated depressive symptoms to test the efficacy of a 12-week, moderate-intensity aerobic exercise intervention (AE) vs. a 12- session, health education comparison (HEC) condition. Both conditions will be equated for therapist and participant contact time. Participants in both conditions will receive identical smoking cessation sessions - 8 weeks of telephone counseling with transdermal nicotine patch (TNP). While capitalizing on the synergistic effects of exercise for both reducing depressive symptoms and promoting smoking cessation, the long-term goal of this program of research is to develop an effective, disseminable exercise intervention that can aid smokers with elevated depressive symptoms quit smoking.  We expect that the results of this study will establish the AE intervention as efficacious for tobacco cessation in smokers with elevated depressive symptoms and will produce valuable scientific knowledge regarding the psychological and biological mechanisms of action. The public health significance of this program of research lies in the potential for adapting the AE intervention for future dissemination to community fitness venues (e.g., YMCA, local health club/gym), primary care settings and for use in conjunction with state tobacco quitlines, in the hopes of decreasing the overall prevalence of cigarette smoking, thereby reducing smoking-related morbidity and mortality."
"9373382","Project Summary/Abstract  Chromosomally mediated resistance to ceftriaxone in Neisseria gonorrhoeae is of great concern in public health. With over 350,000 infections reported in the US, and over 78 million infections estimated world-wide, the possibility of losing the most effective antibiotic for treating gonorrhea is such a concern that the CDC has labeled multidrug resistant N. gonorrhoeae an urgent public health threat. N. gonorrhoeae has become resistant to essentially all antibiotics that have been used historically to treat gonococcal infections, including penicillin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, and incidences of resistance to the currently used dual therapy antibiotics, ceftriaxone and azithromycin, are rapidly increasing. Despite all of the research on antibiotics and their lethal targets, the actual mechanism by which bacteria are killed by bactericidal antibiotics is still not entirely clear. It has been proposed that bactericidal antibiotics kill Escherichia coli by a common mechanism, and our studies in N. gonorrhoeae are consistent with this hypothesis. By transforming all known resistance determinants from different resistant clinical isolates into multiple recipient strains, we have determined that whereas we can reach the same MICs of bacteriostatic antibiotics as those of the donor strains, the MICs of a broad range of bactericidal antibiotics are consistently 3-4 fold lower in the transformed strains compared to the donors. This pan-resistance suggests that bactericidal antibiotics kill bacteria by a common mechanism, and that resistant clinical isolates have altered this common mechanism to increase resistance to bactericidal antibiotics.  This proposal focuses on the genetic analysis of antibiotic resistance. In Specific Aim 1, we will examine the transcriptional profile of PenR and CephR clinical isolates that display pan-resistance to bactericidal antibiotics, both in the absence and in the presence of a breakpoint concentration of a set of bactericidal and bacteriostatic antibiotics. Moreover, because in clinical settings N. gonorrhoeae never interacts with antibiotics in isolation, but within the host, these studies will also be done in the presence of human-derived endocervical epithelial cells. These studies will test the hypothesis that host cells targeted by gonococci impose stresses distinct from that experienced by gonococci in laboratory media during exposure to bactericidal antibiotics. Once this set of genes is identified, their roles in resistance to bactericidal antibiotics will be investigated. In Specific Aim 2, we will utilize transposon mutagenesis with negative selection to identify genes involved in intrinsic resistance to ?-lactam antibiotics, which will identify new targets for future drug development. The proposed studies build on our past successes in defining the mechanisms of chromosomally mediated antibiotic resistance in N. gonorrhoeae, while utilizing new technologies and approaches to identify genes that modulate resistance to antimicrobials. These studies will enable us to fully understand the complex mechanisms involved in mediating gonococcal resistance to ceftriaxone and other bactericidal antibiotics."
"9316320","Abstract The eukaryotic genome is packaged into chromatin formed of repeating units called nucleosomes. Nucleosomes consist of an octamer of core histone proteins (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4) around which DNA is wrapped. A fifth type of histone, the H1 linker histone, associates with chromatin in a dynamic fashion, promoting compaction of chromatin into higher order structures. Mammals express 11 H1 histone subtypes that differ in primary sequence and regulation. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) to the core histone proteins are increasingly recognized as key regulators of chromatin structure and function, affecting many processes occurring on DNA, including transcription, replication and DNA repair. Given the central role of core histone PTMs in epigenetic regulation, it is not surprising that dysregulation of their formation leads to a variety of disease states, most notably cancer. Although the H1 histone has been viewed primarily as a chromatin structural protein, studies from our lab have revealed novel roles for linker histones in epigenetic regulation, including subtype-specific regulation of core histone methylation and DNA methylation. However, the molecular mechanisms by which H1's affect core histone methylation and the full range of core histone PTMs regulated by H1 subtypes are unknown. H1 histone genes are frequently mutated in a several cancers, particularly lymphomas. However, the effects of these mutations on H1's functions in epigenetic regulation have not been studied. We propose to determine the mechanism by which certain H1 subtypes inhibit H3K4 methylation, an activating histone mark whose aberrant deposition is linked to several cancers. We also propose to explore H1-mediated regulation of methylation at other residues in H3 and H4 histones. Finally, we seek to investigate the consequences of cancer-associated mutations in H1 proteins on their functions in epigenetic regulation. Successful completion of this work will reveal novel mechanisms of epigenetic regulation by linker histones in both normal and cancer cells."
"9207538","DIVISION OF PRIMATE RESOURCES: BEHAVIORAL MANAGEMENT SERVICES PROJECT SUMMARY Behavioral Management Services (BMS) is responsible for ensuring the behavioral health of NHPs housed at the WaNPRC. BMS provides updates to the WaNPRC Environmental Enhancement Plan (EEP) and SOPs pertaining to animal well-being and enrichment. BMS is also responsible for monitoring animals for abnormal behavior, assessing and treating behavioral problems and evaluating responses to treatments. BMS operates a positive reinforcement training program to facilitate cooperative sampling and improve animal welfare. During the previous granting period our program compared two behavioral monitoring methods (Zones and focal monitoring) and identified the most efficient procedure. We also identified a therapy for locomotor stereotypy (increased vertical cage space) and have evaluated seven pharmaceutic treatments in 24 animals. BMS is also currently assessing the therapeutic value of providing leafy greens to ameliorate alopecia. During the next funding period BMS will continue to work with veterinary services to test pharmacologic and other therapies for abnormal behavior and alopecia. BMS is also responsible for forming social pairs and groups. Currently 82% of WaNPRC animals (which do not have scientific or veterinary exemptions) are socially housed. Our goal is to have at least 85% of animals housed in social configurations. BMS oversees enrichment provided by the husbandry staff and is responsible for purchasing and evaluating enrichment devices. During the past 5-year period we have evaluated toy use for 16 different cage toys as well as safety and efficacy of 20 foraging devices. Our program has also evaluated the use of water enrichment and perching/play structures in our Seattle small group housing. During the last granting period BMS has conducted a comprehensive behavioral evaluation of nursery-reared infants and these assessments are ongoing. Outcomes of these observations indicate that for our colony, nursery rearing has minimal impact on behavioral development. A total of 910 hair samples have been collected at the Seattle and Arizona facilities to assess physiological measures of colony well-being with hair cortisol. Some results from these data have been published or submitted for publication and further assay and analyses are ongoing. BMS continues to contribute to the currently accepted professional standards of animal welfare by publishing relevant research on behavioral management and presenting data at national/ international meetings. During the past funding period eight papers have been published in peer reviewed journals and another four are currently submitted for publication. BMS has also been author or co-author on 19 presentations at scientific meetings. Dr. Worlein serves as the WaNPRC representative to the NPRCs Behavioral Management Consortium and also as a member the newly formed Phenotype Mining and New Model Development Working Group (PMNMD). BMS also plays a key role in training new WaNPRC personnel regarding enrichment, ecology and behavior of NHPs as well as providing a for-credit University of Washington laboratory class."
"9348590","PROJECT SUMMARY  The Sample Processing and Immunoassay REsearch SPIRE Core (Core C) is designed to serve the RDRCC research community as a centralized resource for preparation and storage of clinically derived samples, for conducting a range of standard and innovative assays on clinically derived material and for serving as a conduit to other relevant research cores within the Institution. This core has facilitated, through disease-specific centers of excellence, the generation of large specimen bio-repositories recovered from well-pedigreed patient cohorts. In this manner, this well- established core, by providing biospecimen acquisition, processing, storage and retrieval services, has become a critical partner in enabling discovery at the translational interface, and in attracting the interest of a growing group of researchers. In addition, the high-quality assay services provided by Core C have resulted in numerous peer-reviewed publications, abstracts and investigator-initiated grant proposals. The assay capabilities in the Core play a critical role in pathway validation in human rheumatic disease cohorts. The aims of this proposal are to sustain, grow and evolve this vital resource. We propose to expand the range of services offered to include innovative, cutting-edge technologies/approaches and serve as consultants and the pipeline to the necessary institutional expertise and resources that provide NextGen analytical approaches, and for advanced data analysis and interpretation. This interactive, dynamic framework has, and will continue to catalyze major leaps forward in research on the autoimmune rheumatic diseases.  Core C will be directed by Drs. Casciola-Rosen and Soloski, both of whom have many years of experience in immunology, assay development, and directing high quality research responsive Cores. Drs. Andrade and Gutierrez, both of whom have many years of experience working with this Core team, will provide additional leadership. The close collaboration of this Core with the Administrative (Core A), Research Management and Patient Integrated Data (RAPID, Core B) and Data Science (Core D) Cores provides a powerful matrix to maximize synergies, resources and innovative collaborations in the environment."
"9314562","PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility of developing recombinant human milk fat globule epidermal growth factor-factor 8 (rhMFG-E8) as a novel and effective therapeutic for patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) associated with ischemia due to low renal perfusion. AKI is a major cause of prolonged hospitalization and increased mortality. Ischemic AKI often results from decreased renal blood flow associated with cardiac surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass, especially coronary artery bypass graft and valve replacement. Despite being a frequent, life-shortening, and costly complication, no FDA-approved drugs are currently clinically available to treat ischemic AKI. MFG-E8 is a protein that promotes the clearance of inflammation-promoting dying cells and decreases the influx of tissue-damaging neutrophils to the injured site. In the preliminary study, we used recombinant mouse MFG-E8 to treat mice with AKI induced by severe renal ischemia-reperfusion. Treatment with recombinant mouse MFG-E8 significantly attenuated renal dysfunction, decreased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, and reduced kidney infiltration by neutrophils. Therefore, we hypothesize that rhMFG-E8 can be developed as a new and effective biologic drug to treat patients with ischemic AKI. Indeed, administration of His-tagged rhMFG-E8 increased the 10-day survival of mice with ischemic AKI from 47% to 68%. Since His-tagged proteins are not suited for use in humans, we have started to produce a druggable, human-like glycosylated, His tag-free rhMFG-E8 using a mammalian Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell expression system. In this project we will express, purify, and characterize CHO-expressed rhMFG-E8. We will next determine CHO-expressed rhMFG-E8's efficacy to attenuate renal injury and improve survival after ischemic AKI, and its pharmacokinetic (PK) profile in healthy and AKI animals. Our future steps (SBIR Phase II and beyond) include completing preclinical and safety studies, establishing ADME and safety studies, determining efficacy in a second species, and filing an investigational new drug (IND) application with the FDA to initiate clinical trials. Our ultimate goal is to obtain commercial utilization of rhMFG-E8 as a safe and effective biologic drug to treat patients with ischemic AKI."
"9282530","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is often accompanied by significantly elevated blood pressure (BP), accounting for as much as 65-75% of the risk for essential hypertension. Obesity-induced hypertension is often resistant to conventional antihypertensive therapies, similar to Little syndrome which is caused by gain-of- function mutation of ENaC. Despite a strong association between body weight and BP, the etiologic basis of obesity-induced hypertension is unclear. There is a consensus, however, that increased Na+ reabsorption by the kidney may play a major role. Emerging evidence from clinical and animal studies further suggests that Na retention in obesity may occur primarily through overactivation of ENaC in the distal nephron. In particular, a randomized clinical trial demonstrated effectiveness of ENaC inhibition for improving BP control in black Americans (all of whom were clinically obese). In the present application, we propose to test the hypothesis that obesity-induced hypertension is caused by an imbalance of sodium regulatory hormones in the collecting duct (CD) with overactivation of natriferic prostaglandin D2 (PGD2)/15-deoxy-delta(12,14)-PGJ2 (15d- PGJ2)/PPAR? pathway and suppression of natriuretic microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1)/PGE2 pathway. Major approaches proposed in this application involve analysis of the phenotype of newly generated mice with CD-specific deletion of mPGES-1. We will further employ molecular and electrophysiological approaches to determine ENaC as the molecular target of PGE2 and WNK4-mediated paracellular transport as the molecular target of PPAR?. The new information resulted from this proposal is expected to provide novel insight into dysregulation of fluid metabolism in metabolic syndrome."

"9393146","Abstract: In the United States (U.S.), transgender women (TW) are one of the populations most affected by HIV infection. The high prevalence of HIV infection among U.S. TW is driven by, and/or concomitant with, structural barriers that limit access to HIV prevention, care, and health services. Despite an emergence of research to characterize the HIV epidemic among TW, the majority of studies are cross-sectional designs and typically include small sample sizes, often subsuming TW among broader risk groups, such as men who have sex with men. These practices have thwarted identification of acceptable, effective recruitment and study methods for use among TW and prevented temporal assessment, causal inference, and generalizability of study findings to the TW population. To date, there is no robust estimate of HIV incidence and no intervention with evidence of efficacy for the prevention of HIV acquisition among TW. The proposed American Cohort study will address these limitations by establishing a multi-site, longitudinal cohort of TW spanning eastern and southern U.S. (Boston, New York City, Baltimore-Washington, Atlanta, and Miami metropolitan areas) to characterize HIV incidence and risk factors for HIV acquisition, access to biobehavioral HIV prevention methods, and linkage to care for those who HIV seroconvert. The cohort will include a racially/ethnically and culturally diverse sample of TW, supported by the use of technology-infused recruitment and retention methods. The specific aims are: 1) To determine the efficiency and acceptability of novel, technology-infused recruitment methods to enroll HIV- uninfected TW into a prospective cohort. 2) To describe the demographic, socioeconomic, behavioral, and physical and mental health profiles of HIV-uninfected TW in the first, multi-site cohort of TW in the eastern and southern U.S. 3) To estimate HIV incidence among TW in high-risk eastern and southern U.S. areas, trends in incidence, and associated individual, social, and structural risk factors. 4) To estimate the HIV Prevention Continuum among HIV-uninfected participants, and the HIV Care Continuum among newly HIV-infected TW. To achieve these aims we will recruit 1,750 TW who will be enrolled in either a HIV-uninfected cohort or an HIV-infected cross-sectional comparison group. These data will be used to assess differences between cohort participants and the wider population and for cross-sectional incidence estimation at enrollment. The HIV- uninfected cohort will be followed for at least 24 months to estimate HIV incidence, trends, and risk factors for HIV acquisition. Cohort participants who seroconvert will be followed for an additional 6 months to assess prospective engagement in the HIV Care Continuum. Study findings will provide critical epidemiologic parameters for future HIV prevention research among TW, provide a platform upon which other research questions can be explored, and inform the development of evidence-based and acceptable HIV interventions to reduce HIV acquisition among TW in the U.S."
"9349496","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in individuals over the age of 65 and the prevalence in the United States this year is estimated at 5.2 million. 83,494 Americans died from the disease in 2010 and an estimated 70,000 more will die from AD this year, and it remains without a cure. Empirical data strongly suggest that amyloid-? (A?) deposition and blood-brain barrier (BBB) compromise may precede clinical manifestation of the disease by over 20 years. Methods to quantify A? in vivo are therefore actively investigated by the medical research community as a means of early detection. Our long term goal is to develop a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent for visualization of A? plaques in vivo. We recently showed that fluorescent A?-targeted liposomes cross the BBB and avidly label A? pathologies in the brains of APP/PSEN1 mice. In a second generation formulation, we loaded similar particles with a gadolinium contrast agent and obtained MRI data which confirm that they cross the BBB of Tg2576 mice. However, the contrast-to-noise ratio of this agent does not allow unequivocal interpretation of images due to the background signal that exists in proton-based MRI. 19F MRI presents an alternative to address this problem because there is no endogenous 19F MRI detectable signal in soft tissue. Current 1H MRI hardware can be used for 19F MRI with little modification and 19F is a stable atom with 100% natural abundance, easily available, non-radioactive, and inexpensive. Unfortunately, almost all 19F-based agents currently under use for biomedical applications utilize perfluorocarbons (PFCs) which have low aqueous solubility and not amenable to aqueous core liposome formulations protocols. We have designed and synthesized two new hydrophilic fluorinated molecules with this capacity. In this application, we propose to prepare a A?-targeted liposome formulation bearing one of the molecules as a 19F contrast payload and explore its potential as a tool to define and quantify noninvasively, the longitudinal accumulation of amyloid plaques (using 5, 7, 9 and 12-month old APP/PSEN1 mice) by 19F MRI. Completion of this work will result in a potential novel MRI platform for noninvasive detection and quantification of amyloid plaque burden in vivo and a potential contrast agent to other molecular imaging applications."
"9403058","ABSTRACT Atherosclerosis is the primary cause of coronary heart disease (CHD), ischemic stroke, and peripheral arterial disease. Despite effective lipid-lowering therapies and prevention programs, atherosclerosis is still the leading cause of mortality in the United States. Moreover, the prevalence of CHD in developing countries worldwide is rapidly increasing at a rate expected to overtake those of cancer and diabetes. Among prominent risk factors, hardening of arteries resulting from endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction, plays a causative role in promoting atherosclerosis initiation and progression. However, owing to the complexity of the endothelium and scarcity of proper molecular targets, it is widely recognized that hindering dysfunctional endothelium to prevent atheroma progression is a seemingly daunting question. Our long-term goal is to uncover and dissect molecular mechanisms governing endothelial dysfunction, and to aid rapid identification of a new class of potential regulators responsible. To this end, we show that epsins 1 and 2 are upregulated in atheromas in apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/-) mice fed with western diet (WD). Consequently, EC-specific epsins deficiency results in striking attenuation of atherosclerosis in WD fed ApoE-/- mice. Moreover, we observe that upregulation of epsins associates with downregulation of IP3R1 in both mouse and human atherosclerotic lesions. Interestingly, atherogenic mediators induce epsin binding to IP3R1 and IP3R1 downregulation in endothelial cells. Accordingly, IP3R1 loss augments ER stress, while epsin deficiency prevents IP3R1 loss and therefore attenuates ER stress. Despite these novel observations, whether sufficient IP3R1 is required for keeping ER stress at bay and blocking atheroma progression is unclear. Likewise, whether epsins promote atherosclerosis in part via mediating IP3R1 downregulation is unknown. Given that downregulation of ER stress sensors including XBP-1 correlates with IP3R1 stabilization, the ability of XBP-1 to potentiate ERAD and thereby mediate epsin-dependent IP3R1 degradation is unexplored. In pursuit of answers to these highly significant and original questions, we have formulated the central hypothesis that epsin promotes atherosclerosis by inducing downregulation of IP3R1, exacerbating ER stress, and causing endothelial dysfunction. To test our hypothesis, we propose to use novel atherosclerosis mouse models including inducible EC-specific IP3R1 deficient mice (EC-IP3R1iKO), inducible EC-specific epsin DKO mice (EC-iDKO) on EC- specific IP3R1 heterozygous background (EC-iDKO/EC-IP3R1het), and EC-specific XBP-1 deficient mice (EC- XBP-1KO) on ApoE null background. We are poised to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying epsins mediating IP3R1 degradation in atherosclerosis; and molecular mechanisms by which ER stress sensors potentiate epsin-mediated IP3R1 degradation. If fruitful, our findings will hold a high probability of uncovering a counter-intuitive role for endothelial IP3R1 in atherosclerosis, offering a new class of therapeutic strategies by targeting epsins, and inaugurating a paradigm shift in research to combat atherosclerosis."
"9212007","The Animal Models Core (D) is located within the Mycobacteriology Laboratory on the campus of Colorado  State University. The Animal Infection Core is multidisciplinary with the expertise, personnel and facilities to  model Mtb infection in guinea pigs with drug susceptible and resistant human clinical isolates as well as  laboratory Mtb strains with targeted gene mutations. Our laboratory is also experienced and well equipped to  model Mtb infection in guinea pigs with concurrent non-communicable diseases that are known TB risk  factors in humans. Relevant to this proposal, we have developed the first ever model of Mtb infection in  guinea pigs with diet-induced insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes that accurately mimics the comorbidity  of tuberculosis and emerging noncommunicable diseases. In addition, we have designed and validated novel  strategies to quantify pulmonary and extra-pulmonary tuberculosis disease burden in guinea pigs in  response to experimental aerosol infection with drug susceptible and multi-drug resistant strains of  Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We have recently characterized the profound alterations in systemic and  cellular metabolism in response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection alone and demonstrated how  preexisting alterations in host metabolism influences host susceptibility and in vivo disease progression. The  Animal Models Core will parallel human cohort studies to 1) identify host metabolic determinants of  tuberculosis disease control and progression and 2) use metabolomics to discover bacterial determinates of  drug resistance and the discovery of host- and pathogen-derived biomarkers for tuberculosis diagnosis.  Using the guinea pig model to study altered host metabolism associated with Mycobacterium tuberculosis  infection has not only improved our understanding of the host-pathogen interaction but has identified  potentially important therapeutic strategies that can be used as adjunct therapy in combination with  conventional antimicrobial drug therapy. To fully exploit this model, the substantial existing core capabilities  will be expanded to discover and validate additional biomarkers of altered host metabolism in guinea pigs  infected with drug susceptible and drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis."
"9207544","DIVISION OF GLOBAL PROGRAMS  PROJECT SUMMARY The Division of Global Programs (DGP) of the Washington National Primate Research Center (WaNPRC) was officially established in 1999 to help direct, strengthen, and expand the Center?s international collaborations. It represents a broad-based, multi-component unit that supports a wide variety of Center objectives and initiatives. The DGP currently has 16 international partnerships in 12 program countries including Indonesia, Nepal, China, Bangladesh, Thailand, Dem. Rep. of Congo, Mexico, India, Brazil (prog. in development), Laos (prog. in development), Vietnam (prog. in development), and Cambodia (prog. in development).. There are four main objectives of the DGP, that also support many of the NIH-specified goals that are central to the National Primate Research Centers? Program: 1) Resource Support: Assist with the development of international breeding programs and the efficient acquisition and sharing of existing captive primates so as to ensure the availability of nonhuman primate resources at a local, national and international level; 2) Research: Facilitate joint research projects relating to the biology, management, and conservation of wild primate populations with collaborating institutions; 3) Training: Provide educational and training opportunities in primatology, conservation biology and global health for students, staff, and faculty from collaborating institutions; and 4) Outreach: Engage and educate the general public about the importance of primate conservation, the significant achievements in biomedical research, and the translational value of the work. Working in collaboration with our international partners, the DGP will continue to assist with the development/management of primate breeding programs. We also will continue to initiate joint research in the area of Conservation Biology to contribute to the improvement of primate population health, management strategies, and long-term viability. This research program also supports the DGP?s resource objective by generating data that is often pertinent to the operation of primate breeding programs both international and domestic. The DGP?s training and outreach education programs will continue to expand and offer unique educational and learning opportunities in primate conservation biology and global health for university students, professionals, school children (K-12), and the general public, both locally and internationally. The goal is to help stimulate, educate and train the next generation regarding the importance of primate conservation and sustainable use, the significance of biomedical research, and the translational benefits to human health."
"9314584","The Clinical Research Design, Epidemiology, and Biostatistics (CRDEB) KCA will play a crucial role in achieving the CTR-IN goal of accelerating the translation of scientific discovery into improved health by creating a coordinated infrastructure encouraging innovative clinical and translational research and enhancing our training of new and established researchers. The majority of MWRC partner institutions recognize that clinical research design, epidemiology, and biostatistics are critical to investigation, from initial study design through data analysis and the effective communication of results. As a result, a number of independent efforts in these areas exist throughout the MWRC and operate somewhat autonomously. However, multiple barriers to access exist for some researchers. While many successful and established researchers have access to these groups, other investigator's access may be limited and haphazard, particularly for more junior researchers. In addition, there is no coordinated system that provides such support to investigators. Also, the fractured nature and geographical barriers of the Mountain West have impaired the effective integration and dissemination of clinical research design, epidemiology, and biostatistics support, collaboration, and training. In order to overcome these barriers, the CTR-IN will provide local and central contact points for clinical and translational researchers who need assistance in developing study design, biostatistical methods, and epidemiological design. This will foster an energetic and productive climate for clinical and translational research and facilitate research for all investigators, including new and junior investigators."
"8106551","Core D provides technical expertise and state of the art molecular and cellular biology methodology for  cloning and expression of the proteins described in the program project. This centralized operation coordinates  all molecular biology work and ensures that all proteins are cloned and expressed in a uniform  fashion.

This uniformity greatly enhances accuracy of comparison between the proteins.  Core D designs and clones expression vectors encoding wild type or mutated proteins as requested by the  individual investigators. All wild type genes described in this program project are identified, sequenced and  assembled in cloning vectors. Thus, vectors expressing wild type or mutated proteins can be cloned from  cDNAs.

"8114772","Preclinical studies are uniform in demonstrating enlargement of small pre-existing collateral vessels in mice,  rats and rabbits following acute-onset hindlimb ischemia. In the presence of competent endothelial function,  improved collateral flow is sufficient to moderate hindlimb ischemia over the relatively short distances in these  animals. The response in humans, however, is different. While significant increases in clinical indices of  perfusion and exercise tolerance are uniformly observed in patients with intermittent claudication with  prompting stimuli (e.g., daily walking), this cannot be ascribed to improved collateral blood flow in many of the  clinical studies. Meaningful improvement in limb flow capacity requires extensive enlargement of these small  collateral vessels, far greater than observed in small mammals, to compensate for the high conductance that  normally supports flow to muscles at the long distances found in human legs. It is unknown whether the failure  to observe significant increases in collateral blood flow in claudicant patients involved in exercise programs  is due: 1) to an inability to develop sufficiently large collateral vessels due to an inadequate stimulus, or 2)  to an inability to respond to an adequate stimulus that would normally prompt meaningful vessel enlargement.  Further, it is unknown whether establishing a high arterial pressure (e.g., approximately 100 mmHg; increasing radial wall  stress) within the large tortuous collateral conduits is sufficient to minimize regression of the vessel, in the  absence of sustained arteriogenic stimuli that enlarged the collateral in the first place. Using a large mammal  with femoral artery occlusion, we will: a) provide a commanding stimulus for collateral enlargement by  increasing shear stress, using a unique arterial-venous shunt, and evaluate the competency of the  endothelium to support collateral enlargement after inducing endothelial dysfunction by feeding the pigs an  atherogenic diet, known to 'dull' endothelial responsiveness; b) assess the ability of exercise training to  reverse the documented consequences of the HFC diet; and c) determine whether establishing a high luminal  pressure is sufficient to retain large collateral vessels, once formed, in normal, atherogenic diet-fed, and  exercise trained pigs. Instrumented limb blood flow (iliac a.), collateral network images, collateral blood flow  (uspheres), in vitro function and morphology of collateral vessels, involvement of circulating vascular  precursor cells, and functional capacity of the animals will be determined. Our evaluation of large-vessel  collaterals should provide compelling evidence important in the management of claudicant patients with  single-level, large-vessel proximal vascular lesions."

"9517377","Project Summary The combination of pervasive multidrug-resistant bacteria and the slowing discovery of new antimicrobial therapeutics threatens to undermine many global public health advances of the past century. A main focus of the van der Donk lab is understanding the biosynthesis and mechanism of action of natural products with antimicrobial activities. In particular, the lab is interested in a class of molecules known as lanthipeptides that have potent antimicrobial activities and may be useful models for combating antibiotic resistance. Several lanthipeptides are in clinical trials to treat drug-resistant bacterial infections, and the antibiotic lanthipeptide nisin has been used for decades in the food industry to combat food-borne pathogens. Class I lanthipeptide dehydratases, generically termed LanBs, play a key role in the biosynthesis of lanthipeptides as well as other classes of natural products by converting Ser/Thr residues into dehydroalanine/dehydrobutyrine. The van der Donk lab recently demonstrated that LanBs utilize charged tRNAs to glutamylate Ser/Thr side chain alcohols, leading to an ester that is eliminated to form the dehydrated amino acid. The crystal structure of a LanB revealed a modular architecture in which the glutamylation and elimination activities are localized to separate domains. Intriguingly, many enzymes found in genome databases are missing the elimination domain entirely. These short LanB (sLanB) enzymes may thus have a different biosynthetic logic and likely produce previously unknown peptide natural products. In order to investigate these gene clusters, a research strategy aimed at determining the products and biosynthetic logic of sLanB enzymes is proposed using the latest analytical tools, including manipulation of bacterial culture conditions, transcriptional analysis, high-resolution mass spectrometry, stable isotope labeling, heterologous expression, and bioinformatics. Training in these approaches will greatly expand the skill set of the applicant. Specific goals include determining optimal culture conditions for isolation of sLanB-derived natural products in a native producer, investigating the fate of amino acid adducts derived from charged tRNAs, and establishing if sLanB enzymes in different biosynthetic contexts share a general mechanism. These aims include identifying the end products of two distinct sLanB gene clusters and evaluating their function. Given the involvement of LanB-like enzymes in a range of potent and clinically and commercially successful therapeutics, the products of sLanBs may have valuable biological activities. Additionally, understanding what reaction(s) sLanBs catalyze and initial mechanistic characterization may expand the bioinformatic toolbox for genome mining for novel natural products."
"9317925","Project Summary/Abstract The long-term goals of these studies are to establish and apply emerging optical neuroimaging methods, namely diffuse optical tomography (DOT), to map brain function in school-aged children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) during direct within-room social communication. DOT has the potential to elucidate underlying mechanisms, inform clinical interventions, and improve outcome of ASD, thus these aims are in direct correspondence with the mission of NIMH: to transform the understanding and treatment of mental illnesses through basic and clinical research, paving the way for prevention, recovery, and cure. ASD, defined by deficits in social communication and restricted interests/repetitive behaviors, is a serious psychiatric disorder of childhood, is treatable but currently incurable, and affects an estimated 1 in 68 children in the United States at an estimated annual cost of $268B. Early behavioral and educational interventions, starting at 18-24 months of age, improve outcomes in a subset of patients. Recent advances in functional brain imaging show promise that signatures of brain function may provide reliable markers of ASD severity and may be sensitive to interventional therapy. However, current neuroimaging methods (e.g. functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI) are not ideal in research on cognitive-behavioral domains affected in ASD; the loud and constraining MRI environment limits studies on direct within-room social communication involving auditory processing and language generation and presents an excessively challenging setting for sensitive participants, such as school-aged and in particular young children or those severely affected with ASD. DOT provides a compelling alternative that overcomes the significant ergonomic limitations of fMRI and silently images brain function with a wearable cap. However, DOT has yet to be established in studies involving direct within-room social communication. To progress DOT towards this goal, simple language paradigms, validated in healthy adults against subject-matched fMRI, will be adapted for within-room dyadic studies. This project will follow a systematic progression away from the computer interface, standard in neuroimaging, towards a direct natural socio-communicative paradigm, and will lay the foundation for follow-up studies of early childhood development. Aim 1 will use established paradigms of hierarchical language processing for within-subject validation of DOT-based neuroimaging in school-aged children with ASD and sex-, age-, and IQ- matched typically developing controls against fMRI. In Aim 2, a within- room participant will present language and social-communication paradigms. These studies are innovative and significant because the comfortable scanning environment of DOT will enable brain imaging of ASD throughout an extended spectrum of patients, and will lay the groundwork for DOT neuroimaging studies on infants and toddlers at high risk for ASD. This will facilitate longitudinal studies that will map the developmental trajectory of ASD, using paradigms that may combine neuroimaging with behavioral assessment, from infancy to adulthood, and track the effects of interventions with neurophysiological metrics and behavior."
"9320557","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Transradial amputation is the most common level of major upper limb amputation, accounting for an estimated 40% of upper limb loss in the US civilian population and 50% in the US military veteran population over the last decade. Most individuals experience transradial amputation due to trauma, are young, and need prostheses that allow them to resume an active, productive lifestyle. Current prostheses do not provide adequate function, and newer, multifunction prostheses (that are capable of many different hand grasps) cannot be adequately controlled by current control strategies. Poor function is a major factor in high rates of prosthesis rejection in transradial amputees, which contributes to increased disability for these individuals. We have developed a surgical technique, called targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR) in which severed nerves that used to carry important control information to the missing limb are transferred to new 'target' muscles. After reinnervation, the target muscles contract whenever the individual attempts to move their missing arm, generating electrical EMG signals that can be used to control analogous movements in a prosthesis. TMR thus provides access to valuable but previously unavailable control information. Pattern recognition algorithms, developed by CBM-RIC, can decode this rich EMG information to enable intuitive control of many more functions; the user simply has to attempt to make the desired arm or hand movement. This pattern recognition system technology has been licensed for commercial production and will be available for clinical implementation within the next year. Combining TMR with pattern recognition in higher-level arm amputees has resulted in substantially improved control of more DOFs, and control is easier and more intuitive for the user. The goal of this multicenter study is to develop surgical techniques for transradial TMR and to evaluate the benefits of TMR in transradial amputees by performing clinical trials to compare pattern recognition control, before and after TMR, with a conventional control strategy (before TMR). The median and ulnar nerves, which carry control information for intrinsic hand muscles involved in many hand grasps, will be transferred to forearm muscles. Subjects will use a state-of-the-art multifunction prosthesis-with either pattern recognition or conventional control-in activities of daily living during 8-week home trials, followd by comprehensive functional testing and user surveys. Preliminary cadaver and surgical studies indicate that transradial TMR is simple and feasible; data from higher-level TMR amputees indicate that when combined with pattern recognition, TMR provides improved control of multiple hand grasps. We expect that TMR, with pattern recognition, will allow transradial amputees to control more hand grasps more easily and more intuitively. Development of transradial TMR will enable these individuals to control highly dexterous prosthetic hands. It will also undoubtedly stimulate new research into advanced control systems and enable the development of more advanced mechatronic devices."
"9525177","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This project is focused on developing a novel tool for studying gut microbiome impact on human health: an in vitro human model of gut epithelium-microbiome-immune homeostasis. While the gut microbiome is known to have tremendous impact on human health, these effects are complex and generally not well understood, limiting translation of observed microbiome impact to effective therapies. There is currently no in vitro model of human gut epithelium-microbiome-immune homeostasis, and most studies of these effects are thus currently carried out in gnotobiotic rodent models. A controlled, defined in vitro human system capturing key gut microbiome-epithelium-immune interactions would thus be a tremendously valuable tool to academic and industrial scientific and medical research communities. The approach combines development of the necessary hardware as well as culture protocols and biomaterials required for primary intestinal-immune mammalian culture and establishment of microbial populations to be cultured with gut mammalian cells and representative of gut commensal microbe populations. Importantly, the project team has already worked together to establish base fluidic culture platforms and immune-competent biological gut models with co-cultured simple microbial communities, and thus has demonstrated the ability to utilize their unique combination of complementary expertise and move projects toward commercialization. Specific hardware to be developed (Aim 1) includes a fluidic platform for flow mimicking both the circulatory system and flow of gut luminal contents, highly important for controlling oxygen concentration and maintenance of gut homeostasis with a resident microbial population, as well as sensors for oxygen and intestinal barrier function (trans-epithelial electrical resistance, TEER). The primary intestinal culture system (Aim 2) will be in the form of a monolayer for facile access to the apical mucosal surface and will include dendritic cells for immune function. PEG-based biomaterials with tunable chemical functionality and mechanical properties will be used to support the primary intestinal culture, including incorporation of cells key to maintenance of intestinal homeostasis: myofibroblasts and enteric glia. Microbial consortia (Aim 3) will be developed from isolated strains from human samples, and screened for maintenance of homeostasis in gut culture. The integrated gut epithelium-microbiome-immune biological system will be maintained on the developed fluidic platform for extended (2 week) culture, and the impact of the commensal populations on metrics of gut viability and function, as well as cytokine release profiles providing insight into cell signaling events will be analyzed. Tw case studies will be used to assess the ability of the resulting hardware-biology composite system to capture well-characterized responses of the human microbiome (Aim 4). The hardware-culture system will be stimulated to induce leaky gut and inflammation, which will then be ameliorated with specific bacterial species demonstrated to provide beneficial effects in these conditions."
"9513970","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genetics and evelopment nderlie both phenotypic diversity and pathologies with a developmental basis. An increasing number of studies, including genome-wide association studies of disease risk, are linking genetic components to adult phenotypes, but the specific cellular events that link underlying genotype to terminal phenotype can be difficult or impossible to study in many vertebrate systems. Experiments in this project will use an experimentally accessible phenotype (adult pigmentation) in a group of tractable vertebrate organisms (zebrafish and related fishes) to test hypotheses about the developmental connection between genotype and an adult phenotype with relevance to public health. These species develop strikingly different adult pigment patterns through changes in a complex, integrated developmental system characterized by extensive interactions between several migratory, neural crest-derived classes of pigment cells. This project will investigate species-differences in the first cell type to develop impact subsequent pattern development. The experiments in the first aim will determine (i) how the first type of pigment cell class to develop  inhibits the development of subsequent chromatophores, (ii) how a genetic pathway evolved to drive the temporal sequence of pigment cell differentiation across species, and (iii) the role of a  specific regulatory element in modulating gene expression across species. The experiments in the second aim will determine the developmental basis for a unique adult pigment pattern of vertical bars by determining (i) how cell migration has evolved to initiate the new pattern, and if  changes in pigment cells or the tissue environment are responsible for the new pattern potentially through candidate genetic pathways resulting in altered cell differentiation. Training during this project will take place in an integrative environment at the intersection of genomics and empirical developmental biology. The experiments performed and the questions addressed during this project will provide meaningful contributions to understanding the post-embryonic developmental connection between specific genetic differences and diverse adult phenotypes in a model vertebrate system."

The proposed project will utilize established Internet-based strategies, previously used successfully by the research team, to enroll a sample of 5,000 high-risk HIV-negative gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBM) ages 16 to 49?the population representing the highest percentage of new infections annually?and follow them prospectively for four years. The design features of our proposal were chosen specifically to: (a) identify individual-, network-, and contextual-level predictors and correlates of HIV seroconversion, (b) identify missed HIV prevention opportunities among those seroconverting during the course of the study, and, thus (c) inform interventions to further reduce acquisition and transmission.  We define ?high-risk? as meeting CDC guidelines for PrEP treatment, but not taking PrEP. Participants will complete annual self-administered at-home rapid HIV testing (results submitted via digital photo of the test paddle) as well as brief (~20 min) at-home computerized surveys. In addition to being referred for treatment, study participants who seroconvert will complete a semi-structured telephone interview to identify missed HIV prevention opportunities and the contextual factors involved. We will monitor newly diagnosed participants' movement through the HIV care continuum. Based on current incidence rates, we anticipate accumulating ~252 infections during the study; however, because we are targeting high-risk men, this number could be higher. Aim 1 (UG3 Phase): Establish a cohort of 5,000 high-risk HIV-negative GBM who are not on PrEP, all of  whom complete baseline online surveys and at-home self-administered HIV testing, as well as consent for  longitudinal follow-up.

"9328520","Project Summary: Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are a critical and rare population of cells that can self- renew extensively and produce all blood cell lineages. HSCs are maintained and regulated throughout life by extrinsic regulation; disruption of this regulation can lead to loss of HSCs and hematopoietic failure. Thus, understanding HSC extrinsic regulatory mechanisms has important therapeutic implications. Thrombopoietin (TPO) is a hematopoietic cytokine that is canonically understood as a driver of megakaryocyte proliferation and platelet production, but has also been shown to be required for HSC maintenance. However, since TPO is made in the bone marrow, the liver and other tissues, the relative contributions of local and systemic TPO to HSC function are still unknown. This project aims to characterize the in vivo role of TPO in HSC biology by use of two novel mouse models that allow identification of TPO+ populations in the bone marrow, and conditional deletion of Tpo from select tissues. The experiments in this proposal will define the role of TPO in HSC biology, and have major implications for clinical therapies that take advantage of our novel understanding of how HSC regulation is balanced between local and systemic factors."
"9338235","Project Summary/Abstract Primary care providers play a critical role in identifying and managing early chronic kidney disease (CKD) to prevent both development of end stage renal disease and cardiovascular disease.

"9302382","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) is common in people as they age due to conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia. BOO causes lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) that are usually progressive and can lead to urinary incontinence and even renal failure over time. Current therapies are not always effective at preventing this progression and millions of people suffer from bothersome symptoms that have been shown to significantly decrease quality of life. This study presents a paradigm shift in our understanding and potential treatment of BOO by focusing on the inflammation evoked by elevated pressures secondary to increased resistance to urinary outflow. This work springs from the discovery in 2002 of supra-molecular structures, known as inflammasomes, which are formed from Nod-like receptors in response to pathogenic stimuli and also in the setting of sterile inflammation such as is found during BOO. Specifically, NLRP3 is thought to be the mediator of sterile inflammation. Inflammasomes trigger inflammation by causing the maturation and release of IL-1ß and IL-18, two central pro- inflammatory cytokines. While the role of inflammasomes has been elucidated in other organ systems and disease states, their function in the urinary tract has only recently been investigated. Our group was the first to localize them to the urothelium and characterize NLRP3 as playing a central role in the setting of cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis, a well-studied model of sterile inflammation in the bladder.  In this proposal, we test te hypothesis that elevated pressure caused by BOO activates NLRP3 in the urothelia and initiates bladder inflammation.  In turn, the inflammatory response leads to LUTS and fibrosis which corresponds to the clinical deterioration seen in this pathological state. We will also determine i NLRP3 activation causes phenotypic changes in the urothelium which provoke further bladder dysfunction. Our preliminary data strongly suggests that inhibition of NLRP3 in BOO rats considerably diminishes the deleterious effects on the bladder that are normally seen with obstruction. In Aim 1 we will demonstrate that NLRP3 in a urothelial cell line (MYP3) is activated in response to pressure and we will probe the mechanism by which this occurs. Aim 2 is an in vivo study in rats that will allow us to define the role that NLRP3 plays in the development of inflammation, altered urothelial signaling, voiding dysfunction, fibrosis and renal impairment during BOO. Using an FDA-approved medication, glyburide, as the NLRP3 inhibitor in Aim 2 gives this project strong translational potential as this could provide immediate benefit to patients suffering from BOO."
"9493641","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurons form precise and complex neural circuits to generate perception and behavior. A major goal of neuroscience is to map the large ensemble of neural circuits in the brain and understand how they account for normal brain functions and neurological disorders. The small size and optical transparency of larval zebrafish make it an ideal system to investigate neural circuits in an intact vertebrate organism. However, current techniques for mapping neural circuitry in zebrafish are limited in speed and scale, preventing the full realization of zebrafish's potential for neural circuit studies. To address this gap in technology, we propose to develop a virus-based toolkit that would enable rapid and systematic neural circuit mapping in zebrafish. In preliminary studies, we established that vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) can be used as a tool to map neural circuits. It efficiently infects zebrafih neurons, spreads rapidly across synapses, and expresses fluorescent reporters for circuit mapping. VSV labeling could also be combined with other imaging methods to probe neuronal function. To extend these studies, we propose three specific aims: Aim 1. We will establish virus-based tools to map neural circuits on a whole-brain scale, in vivo. We will investigate the characteristics of VSV and distribute reagents and neural circuit mapping results to the community. Aim 2. We will develop tools to elucidate connectivity patterns of specific neuronal types. These tools will be able to (1) target initial infection to defined cell types and (2) identfy neurons that are directly connected to them. Aim 3. We will create tools that combine neural circuit mapping with functional analyses. These tools will help bridge the gap between neural circuit structure and function. In summary, this proposal addresses a critical need for zebrafish neural circuit tracing tools and provides a novel approach to combine anatomical and functional analyses. We will utilize these tools to map the circuitry underlying visual function, both as a tet platform and as a resource for studying vision. These tools could be applied throughout the nervous system and facilitate neural circuit studies in the wider community, e.g. neural development, physiology, behavior, regeneration, as well as disease models."

To ensure medications are delivered to the correct patient, verified pills are placed into a locked medicatio carrier that opens only when physically brought to the correct patient and passed within a few inches of a patient's wrist band that contains an RFID tag. We propose to implement, test and evaluate the IdentRx system for medication administration and charting in nursing homes. We hypothesize that the IdentRx system will reduce both medication administration errors and charting errors in the nursing home setting. Phase 1 - Pilot Integration, Implementation and Testing of IdentRx in a Nursing Home: The pilot will allow the implementation team to fully test the functionality, integration and usability of the new system in a real life environment. Objectives include: (1) Build the IdentRx database to encompass the approximately 3,000 medications on the nursing home formulary. (2) Demonstrate accuracy of IdentRx in pill identification. (3) Interface IdentRx with the eMAR system in use at the long term care facility. (4) Integrate IdentRx with RFID wristband system at the long term care facility (5) Conduct a focus group at the nursing home and on-site workflow observations of medication administration staff to understand medication administration processes. (6) Design user interface and industrial design, and manufacture the IdentRx System and Medication Carriers. (7) Pilot IdentRx and Medication Carriers at the long term care facility. Phase 2 - A Randomized Controlled Trial to Evaluate the Impact of IdentRx on Medication Administration Errors and Workflow in a Nursing Home: We will perform a cluster randomized controlled trial evaluating the impact of IdentRx on the incidence of medication administration and charting errors and workflow in a nursing home. Four patient care units at the nursing facility will be randomized 50:50 to either the IdentRx System (intervention units) or control units. The study's Primary Outcome measure is the rate of medication administration errors and the rate of charting errors in both the intervention and control units. Our goal is to achieve a reduction of >45% in serious medication errors. A secondary outcome is the incidence of potential adverse drug events. A physician panel will rate the severity of each medication administration error to determine whether it has the potential to cause patient harm. Another secondary outcome is to assess the Impact of IdentRx on the workflow of the medication administration staff. The impact of the IdentRx system on nursing efficiency will be measured by performing time-motion studies through direct observation of staff in the intervention and control units."
"9366242","PROJECT SUMMARY With more than five times the number of patients on the wait list than will receive a donor organ in the United States, the field of transplantation is facing a serious donor shortage crisis. Overcoming the organ shortage will require integrated strategies, including a particular focus on overcoming ineffective bio-preservation and stabilization protocols. Longer storage durations will provide the infrastructure required to enable global matching programs, eliminate the need to scramble and conduct unplanned surgeries, and reduce unnecessary waste of quality organs. We believe the method for preserving mammalian organs should employ hibernating and freeze-tolerant strategies in nature that are then further augmented using bioengineering principles. Consequently, we seek to develop a protocol for human organ preservation which will achieve high subzero storage temperatures (ranging from -10 to -20 °C) in the presence of extracellular ice, and storage durations of weeks to months, using inspiration from in nature. Our approach is unique in organ/tissue preservation literature since we aim to actively initiate ice propagation in the vasculature and extracellular spaces, rather than extreme means of inhibiting ice crystallization as is the current standard. The presence of non-injurious ice will be essential in achieving longer storage durations, while also playing an important role in the scale-up to human livers. While this program targets the banking of human liver, our discoveries and solutions will be translatable to other tissues and organ systems. In Specific Aim 1, we will adapt endothelial cell-coated microvascular networks already developed by our group3 in order to model and develop strategies to overcome challenges associated with ice propagation. Since endothelial cells in the vasculature will be the most vulnerable to ice propagation, SA#1 will be an essential proof of concept of our novel strategy and we already have promising data. In Specific Aim 2, we will engineer an ice nucleating agent which will promote non-injurious propagation of ice in extracellular spaces. Ice nucleating agents are essential for restricting ice formation to extracellular spaces and have been identified as critical strategies for freezing survival. In Specific Aim 3, we will reprogram cells to descend into a state of `suspended animation' with enhanced stress tolerance, as inspired by nature. We will achieve this using both passive temperature effects as well as using pharmacological agents. We will perform in-depth characterization of the molecular impact of our cellular reprogramming efforts. In each specific aim, we scale up rapidly to rat whole liver while also validating in human livers in order to maximize impact."
"9314583","The Clinical Education, Mentoring and Career Development (CREMCaD) Key Component Activity will play a central role in achieving the mission of the CTR-IN to increase the quantity, quality, and NIH funding of clinical and translational research thereby accelerating the translation of scientific discovery to improved health in the region. Within the MWRC, considerable development in clinical and translational research education programs has occurred at the University of Hawaii, and the University of New Mexico. These programs are the heritage of many years of institutional change with significant NIH and institutional support. After establishment of the MWRC in 2009, it became clear that similar training programs are either unavailable, or difficult to access, for investigators in most institutions of higher learning across the 7 western IDeA states. At the IDeA regional meeting (Reno 2011), this need for education in clinical and translational mentoring, the lack of mentors, and difficulties in accessing clinical populations were discussed as major limitations to the development of clinical and translational research across the region.    This issue is of critical concern in light of the increased emphasis on T1-T4 research throughout the NIH.  The CREMCaD KCA will establish and provide a coordinated program of training, mentoring and  opportunities for research exchange that will promote the understanding and development of successful  clinical and translational research in the region. The CREMCaD KCA will concentrate on the career  development of a cadre of investigators, including 1) New Investigators (as defined by the NIH) engaged in clinical and translational research, but operating on small budgets and not yet competitive for NIH funding; 2) mid career and senior investigators who may require more comprehensive training in clinical and translational research, and 3) established basic scientists with successful track records but who have not had the. knowledge, opportunity or resources to undertake translational research. The CREMCaD KCA will actively seek out and facilitate participation of investigators from a variety of disciplines, including but not limited to medicine, nursing, public health, nutrition, health physics, physical therapy, kinesiology,  psychology, social work, pharmacology, pharmacy, dentistry, biostatistics, and epidemiology.  Achieving the specific aims of the CREMCaD KCA will transform MWRC research endeavors and will facilitate the emergence of quality collaborative clinical translational research across the MWRC along with the educational activities to sustain it. Specifically, the CREMCaD KCA will increase the number of investigators in the region who have a sophisticated understanding of the forms of clinical and translational research, and who have the skills to conceive, plan and conduct it. By providing a centralized resource to link investigators of different levels to appropriate mentoring and educational opportunities, the CREMCaD KCA will play a key role in the development of new clinical and translational projects that will be competitive for extramural funding."
"9209425","Project summary (Core 1) This proposal brings together the translational medicine and research expertise of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), Dana Farber/Harvard Cancer Center, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) with the clinical research strength of Intergroupe Francophone du Myeloma (IFM) in France and the genomics expertise of the Sanger Institute in the UK to develop a curative strategy for MM. In this international collaborative renewal application, we now propose to build on our highly successful genomic, preclinical, clinical, and administrative strengths to address the next generation of questions that will ultimately lead to therapeutic advances for cure. Most importantly, our current study has confirmed that achieving MRD negative status provides significantly superior survival outcome. In this proposal, we will now undertake an international collaborative trial to address the next most important issue of how MRD status will inform our therapeutic decision algorithm (Project 1). Importantly, the large number of uniformly treated patients will allow us to both identify genomic and epigenomic correlates of disease behavior (Project 2) and identify molecular circuits and validate novel combination targeted therapeutic approaches (Project 3) as well as to define the mechanisms and clinical implications of genomic instability in MM (Project 4). This unique international collaborative effort requires significant co-ordination of effort, integration of strategies, monitoring and oversight of various functions, and communication between investigators at various dispersed sites. The key function of Core A is integration of the research efforts and communication between investigators. Scientific and administrative integration is essential to assure successful interaction between the four Projects, as well as between the laboratory and clinical components within and between projects in this multinational multi-institutional program. Therefore, this central core will provide the link between various projects and successfully co-ordinate the clinical study and the proposed correlative science. To aid in achieving these goals, Core A will: monitor the timely conduct of the clinical study and assure progress in tissue collection, processing and usage to co- ordinate interaction between the clinical and correlative science studies (Specific Aim 1); co-ordinate communication, and exchange of data between investigators at various international sites (Specific Aim 2); provide necessary resources, fiscal oversight and administrative support for projects and cores (Specific Aim 3); facilitate intra-programatic interactions, meetings, travel and Internal and External Advisory Committees (Specific Aim 4)."
"9337437","Summary Congress dictated in 1998 that neither place of residence nor place of listing should be a major determinant of access to a transplant, but geographic disparities in access to kidney and liver transplantation are a major problem that has persistently worsened. Kidneys are allocated by waiting time, but there are 8-fold differences in median waiting times across donation service areas (DSAs). Livers are intended to go to the candidate with the highest MELD (model of end-stage liver disease) score, but instead median MELD varies by 10 points across DSAs, and 90-day probability of LT for candidates with high MELD varies from 18%-86%.  The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) unanimously resolved in 2012 that the existing geographic disparity in allocation? is unacceptably high, calling for studies of optimized systems. A few ad hoc fixes have been proposed, but optimizing policy has rarely been explored, and no comprehensive solution has ever been implemented. Even the two recent major policy changes, Share-35 and the new kidney allocation system (KAS), did not explicitly address geographic disparities. Clamorous scientific controversy over whether the geographic disparity in organ availability is truly structural or merely reflects heterogeneity in clinical practice and organ procurement organization performance contributes to the policy stalemate.  We have started working closely with the OPTN Liver Committee to design optimized sharing districts that would significantly reduce geographic variation in access to deceased donor livers. However, this preliminary work is currently limited by poor metrics of geographic variation and uncorrected measures of supply and demand. Furthermore, other promising concepts, like redrawing DSA boundaries, or dynamic prioritization of candidates without pre-determined maps, have not yet been explored or evaluated. Finally, no work has been done to adapt optimization models designed for liver allocation to the different priorities of kidney allocation.  We will develop new approaches to making transplantation more equitable, considering both clinical practice and allocation systems. Using an innovative adaptation of mathematical optimization and statistical inference to transplant policy, we will isolate the fundamental drivers of geographic disparity and outline promising policies to make deceased donor organs equally available to candidates across the country. We will address the following aims: (1) To construct metrics of geographic variation in access to liver and kidney transplantation that adjust for heterogeneity inherent to clinical practice; (2) To measure fundamental demand for and supply of organs; (3) To understand the impact of recent allocation changes on clinical decision-making and geographic disparities; and (4) To design and test optimized sharing systems that reduce geographic disparity while explicitly accounting for uncertainty in supply and demand. The proposed research directly addresses a Congressional mandate and uses the approach favored by the OPTN. More equitable organ distribution will save lives and improve the care of over 100,000 patients currently at risk of dying on the waiting list."
"9325536","The Biostatistics Epidemiology Core (BsEpC) will serve as a vital intellectual forum for the development of a  structural framework for our specific hypotheses and guidance for efficient analysis strategies and  procedures to implement them. The services (specific aims) of the BsEpC cover four areas: (1) Data  management, quality assurance and oversite of quality control; (2) Development of structural framework for  epidemiologic analysis; (3) Guidance and implementation of statistical analysis; and (4) provide user-friendly  softare to UCB-Stanford data analysts and make software available to other children's environmental health  centers. We illustrate these core services in the following description of the BsEpC by providing projectspecific  examples ofthe structural framework and data analysis plans for testing specific hypotheses. By  laying out our approach to handling intermediate variables in the estimation of direct causal effects of  ambient air pollution, we emphasize the innovative aspects of one ofthe analytical approaches common to  all projects within this Center. The central features of our distinctive approach are 1) construction of DAGs,  and 2) implementation ofthe road map approach to targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE), and  3) analysis of the piecewise natural history study design (for 2 of the 3 projects). For each hypothesized  mechanism, our approach partitions the total (crude) effect of air pollution on specific children's health  outcomes into natural direct and indirect effects, taking a distributional view of both the exposure and the  intermediates hypothesized. From this we derive a distribution ofthe strength of a particular intermediate in  the pathway, relative to all pathways that do not include the specific intermediate. We will focus on a  exposure distributions observed in our data or relevant for policy considerations along with a set of  distributions for the hypothesized intermediates that reflect the heterogeneity expected in different  populations. We will carry out the hypothesis tests in the context of a lifecourse view of both critical timing  and duration of specific exposures. Moreover, we will do so in a time-efficient manner so that many of the  lifecourse questions can be addressed in a single grant cycle."
"9407759","ABSTRACT  Sickle cell disease (SCD) affects approximately 100,000 people in the United States and millions worldwide. Symptoms appear shortly after birth, and in less developed countries the majority of children with SCD die before the age of five. In the U.S., SCD patients suffer chronic pain and fatigue, severe acute painful crises requiring hospitalization and opiates, strokes, and multi-organ damage, and have an average mortality in their 40s. The only FDA approved drug for adults with SCD is the anticancer drug hydroxyurea. New treatments are desperately needed for both children and adults with SCD.  SCD-101 is a botanical drug that inhibits red blood cell sickling in vitro and in vivo. The formation of sickle shaped red blood cells, caused by the polymerization of deoxygenated sickle hemoglobin, is the primary and causative event in the molecular pathogenesis of sickle cell disease; therefore, inhibition of sickling by SCD-101 should ameliorate the signs, symptoms, and slow the progression of sickle cell disease. In a Phase 1B study, SCD-101 was shown to be safe and reduced pain and fatigue, the two most common symptoms of sickle cell disease.  The compounds in SCD-101 responsible for the antisickling activity are unknown, as is the mechanism of antisickling. Identification of the antisickling compounds would assist in clinical development and may enable the development of a more potent and effective drug for the treatment of sickle cell disease. Identification of the antisickling compounds would assist in the elucidation of the mechanism by which SCD-101 inhibits red blood cell sickling and point the way to a new target for antisickling drugs, and the development of a new class of compounds to treat sickle cell disease."
"9207550","DIVISION OF REPRODUCTIVE AND DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCES  PROJECT SUMMARY The overarching goal of the Division of Reproductive and Developmental Sciences is to develop and use the nonhuman primate as a model to advance prevention strategies, clinical treatments and public health interventions to reduce the burden of disease associated with reproductive and developmental disorders. Studies within the division are focused on the biological expression and treatment of developmental disorders associated with HIV, Fragile X, infantile strabismus, blindness, amblyopia, infection-induced preterm birth and neonatal encephalopathy. Our studies also provide critical data to inform public health strategies to prevent developmental disorders associated with prenatal and early postnatal exposure to environmental chemicals. Advances in any of these high-value research areas have the potential to translate into a reduced number of American children with life-long cognitive and sensory disabilities. For the next 5 years, we plan to build upon our recent successes and expand our research programs, providing greater research and training opportunities for scientists around the world. To achieve the goals of the division, we are proposing the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1) Update the neurodevelopmental assessment battery in the Infant Primate Research Laboratory and expand our in-house research program in visual sciences. In the next grant period, we will collect integrated, real-time simultaneous measurements of cognition (visual recognition memory), eye movements (visual tracking) and electrophysiology (EEGs). Bringing together real-time brain activity measurements with cognition will provide a new pathway for developmental neuroscience with infant macaque monkeys. Specific Aim 2) Expand our in-house research program of developing genetically modified nonhuman primate models of neurodevelopmental and reproductive disorders. Research activities in the Reproductive Biology and Stem Cell Laboratory have identified innovative approaches to improve the efficiency and efficacy of gene- editing techniques. Successful application of gene editing in the nonhuman primate will allow DRDS scientists to develop cellular and whole-animal model systems of neurodevelopmental and reproductive disorders such as Fragile X. Specific Aim 3) Expand our nascent in-house research program in stem cell transplantation therapies. We plan to introduce new nonhuman primate pluripotent stem cell lines with defined molecular and functional capabilities for stem cell transplantation studies. Specific Aim 4) Expand our in-house educational program to provide opportunities for specialized training in nonhuman primate research strategies and protocols. The research conducted by division scientists provides critical training for undergraduate and graduate students, medical school residents and postdoctoral fellows. Opportunities for hands-on research training will continue to be at the center of our educational program."
"9320809","Project Summary/Abstract ? Administrative Core The Administrative Core, Steering Committee, Mentoring and Networking Program, Bioinformatics Core and DRP Program are the elements that bring together the participating institutions and their SC INBRE programs into an active network. The structure, organization and functions of the Administrative Core will be essentially as in the current SC INBRE except for the fact the addition of an administrative assistant who will take care of the financial management and data collection-reporting functions of the program. This will free up the Program Manager, PI and PC to concentrate on the expanded functions of the Administrative Core, particularly the DRP program and Mentoring and Networking program needs. The Administrative Core will manage SC INBRE III in all of its aspects, activities and functions. In particular, the Core will handle all of the organizational and logistic aspects of the DRP Program, the Mentoring and Networking Program and the Bioinformatics Pilot Projects program, in addition to providing help, support and oversight to the individual Institutional SC INBRE program at each partner institution. The Core will facilitate formal evaluation of SC INBRE, performed as always by the External Advisory Committee (EAC) and the External Evaluator. Another important level of informal evaluation resides with the Steering Committee and its Mentoring Subcommittee, which monitor the performance of faculty and students at their respective institutions on an ongoing basis. The Administrative Core will support the activities of the Bioinformatics Core which will continue fostering the development of new scientific ideas through an expanded Bioinformatics Pilot Project program, and by providing services ranging from data analysis/storage/management to grant proposal preparation, to the organization of courses and workshops. Last, but not least, The Administrative Core will continue to promote diversity across the network. Virtually all the PUIs have increased underrepresented minority (URM) participation in their programs, and some are at the forefront of educating first-generation college students from URM and underserved populations. Each institution has developed a written diversity plan as a component of their application for membership in the SC INBRE network. Key to the success of these plans is to coordinate the efforts of SC INBRE PUI programs and carefully monitor their progress, so that the leadership of each institution keeps a strong focus on diversity and sustains URM recruitment and retention efforts at all levels. The EAC has been extremely effective in guiding us and making sure that we kept a strong focus on this particular area. The Administrative Core will monitor each school?s progress in this area, facilitating review by the EAC and the External Evaluator and managing data collection and reporting."
"8114836","The Core will manage animals (rabbits and mice) from which myocytes will be isolated at Loyola for use in all  4 of the projects. The mice used will include wild type and genetically modified mice that are developed and  bred in Core D at UCSD (including some that will be subjected to transverse aortic banding to induce  chronic pressure overload in Project by Brown). The rabbits used will include both control and heart failure (HF)  rabbits (induced by combined pressure and volume overload). The core will also be responsible for the  preparation and functional monitoring of HF rabbits during the evolution of dysfunction (under the direction  of Dr. S.M. Pogwizd at UIC). The core will also culture adult cardiac myocytes for 24-48 hours for studies  involving adenoviral gene transfer. These myocytes will be used directly by the three Loyola projects (l-lll)  for functional, imaging and biochemical analysis and also by Project by Brown for biochemical analysis (after  experimental treatment by the investigators at Loyola and shipment to UCSD). The procedures carried out  are specialized, but the personnel involved are expert in their respective roles and this should run smoothly  and efficiently in making the best use of the myocytes available.  Mice are especially valuable because of the opportunity to genetically manipulate the molecules under  investigation (and we are taking advantage of that in The Genetic Mouse Models and Adenoviruses Core) and collectively we have extensive experience  with mouse myocytes and cardiovascular disease models. The mouse work will be complemented by  studies in rabbit, where similar genetic manipulation is not practical, but rabbits are highly advantageous  here for two major reasons. First, the electrophysiological and Ca handling properties in rabbit ventricle are  very similar to that in human. Second, we have already developed a well-characterized rabbit model of  heart failure. Indeed, the HF rabbits manifest both severely depressed LV contractile function and  spontaneously-occurring ventricular arrhythmias. Rabbit myocytes are also well suited for the measurements  to be made (including: voltage clamp, fluorescence imaging, biochemical and molecular studies, and  in vitro adenoviral gene transfer. The services provided by this core are essential to the successful  completion of the science in Projects by Bers, Blatter, Mignery, and Brown, enabling the elucidation of mechanistic roles of IP3R and CaMKII in ECC, arrhythmogenesis, hypertrophy and HF."
"8114771","Endothelial cells play an important role in determining the risk for atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease  (CAD). Exercise may restore/preserve a healthy endothelium and limit atherosclerosis. An important part of  this project will be to determine in a well-controlled porcine model, the effects of exercise on the expression  of a group of proteins known to have a central role in determining the risk of vascular disease. The  experiments are focused on a set of putative PPAR-responsive mRNAs/proteins and lipoprotein lipase (LPL).  LPL is a rate-limiting enzyme for the metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, and as such, high levels of  LPL activity have been associated with the metabolic demands of exercise. The effect of LPL-dependent  lipolysis on the phenotype of endothelial cells is still largely unclear and needs to be elucidated. A strength  of these experiments is that they employ a multifaceted and collaborative approach to accomplish a definitive  set of hypothesis-driven studies. Molecular studies will determine the mRNA and protein targets regulated  directly by LPL-dependent signaling in endothelial cells (Aim 1). This aim will use a wide-range of  experimental culture conditions involving different amounts of LPL activity, purified lipoprotein substrates, RNA  interference for signaling studies, and pharmacological ligands to compare with lipoprotein derived ligands.  Aim 1 will also test for interactions during exposure to TNFa as a pro-inflammatory cytokine. More  physiological studies will be performed in isolated conduit arteries while determining the interactions between  chemical signals caused by experimentally reducing and increasing LPL activity, and the hemodynamic  signaling caused by altering flow rate over a wide range (Aim 2). Exercise training studies will determine how  LPL and a group of related proteins are regulated in different vascular sites (Aim 3). Aim 3 will be a very  complete examination of exercise responses because it will determine the effects of training in pigs fed a  normal fat diet before there is a risk of CAD, in a model of risk for early CAD, and in more advanced CAD.  These studies will provide important novel insights about regulation of LPL activity, and the mechanisms  involved in determining a healthy endothelial cell phenotype."
"9316635","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is one of the leading causes of blindness in the United States and many other nations and is the leading cause of blindness in African Americans. Elevated intraocular pressure (ocular hypertension or OHT) is a major risk factor for developing POAG and the only modifiable risk factor at present. 4-7% of the United States population above age 40 has OHT. A major public health issue is how to apply the principles of patient- centered care and manage this large group of people in an effective and cost-effective manner. The OHTS carefully followed OHT participants for a median of 13 years (OHTS Phase 1 and 2). This includes 279 participants who developed POAG during the study, the largest inception cohort of POAG patients ever described. We propose to re-examine all surviving OHTS participants at 20 years or more in 2015-2017 (OHTS Phase 3). We will determine the incidence and severity of POAG in the OHTS cohort and determine the frequency and severity of self-reported functional limitations associated with POAG. We will also develop a 20-year prediction model for stratifying OHT patients by their risk of developing POAG and, among those who developed POAG, a prediction model for the rate of visual field loss. OHTS Phase 3 will allow us to develop evidence-based, 20-year guidelines for the management of patients with OHT. This will aid patients and clinicians to make informed decisions about the appropriate frequency of examinations and tests and the benefit of early, preventative treatment. Informed decisions should improve outcomes, reduce costs and reduce patient and clinician burden."
"9313941","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Depression is highly prevalent, both in the US and worldwide. Among US adults, the estimated 12-month and lifetime prevalence rates are 8.3% and 19.2%, respectively. The World Health Organization considers major depressive disorder (MDD) as the third-highest cause of disease burden worldwide, and the highest cause of disease burden in the developed world. However, despite its prevalence and burden, depression remains significantly under-recognized and under-treated in all practice settings, including managed care where less than one third of adults with depression obtain appropriate professional treatment. Denial of illness and stigma are two primary barriers to proper identification and treatment of depression. Many individuals with depression are ashamed to seek out a mental health professional and consider depression a sign of personal weakness. In particular, self-stigma has been associated to affect adherence to psychiatric services, hope and quality of life negatively, and also poses as a barrier for social integration. Further, since self-stigma can exist without actual stigma from the public, and is more hidden and inside, it seems to be the worst form of stigma against people with depression and can directly affect the patients' over all well-being. Studies suggest that early recognition and treatment of depressive behavior and symptoms can improve social function, increase productivity, and decrease absenteeism in the workplace. However, recognition of depression, particularly in early stages, is still challenging. To address this problem, in this proposal we plan to develop effective methods for detection of depressive behavior, not only at an individual-level, but also at a community-level. The latter is highly pertinent because depression is significantly influenced by variations in social determinants and socio- ecological factors. In particular, we will leverage robust and longitudinal electronic health record (EHR) systems at Mayo Clinic and private insurance (UnitedHealthCare/Optum Labs) reimbursement and claims data along with online social media data from Twitter and PatientsLikeMe as well as geo-coded neighborhood and environmental data to develop a big data platform for identifying combinations of online socio-behavioral factors and neighborhood environmental conditions to enable innovative ways for detection of depressive behavior within communities and identify patterns and changes in health care utilization for depression across different communities and geographies within U.S."
"9367744","PROJECT ABSTRACT The IL-6 signaling pathway is dysregulated in autoimmunity in part through increased expression of the membrane bound IL-6R (mbIL-6R). The central hypothesis for the proposed studies is that elevated mbIL-6R expression leads to altered T cell fate and function resulting in pathogenic autoreactive T cells due to changes in the magnitude and balance of STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation. The following three Specific Aims will address this hypothesis. Aim 1 studies will determine the regulation of mbIL-6R expression in T cells from type 1 diabetes (T1D), relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) subjects at the genetic, transcriptional, translational and post-translation level, focusing on the contribution of the IL6RAsp358Ala variant and ADAM17 mediated shedding. Aim 2 studies will determine how increased mbIL-6R alters the magnitude and balance of STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation and how these changes influence the T cell response with respect to lineage commitment, homing and response to regulation. These studies will take advantage of a cohort of healthy subjects with genetically determined mbIL-6R expression levels. Aim 3 studies will determine the impact of elevated mbIL-6R expression on both total T cells and autoreactive T cells in T1D, RRMS and RA. The primary endpoints will be T cell lineage commitment, transcriptional profile, and response to regulation. This aim will also determine the effect of elevated mbIL-6R expression on the islet specific T cell response to tocilizumab in T1D. The studies proposed in this application are appropriate for the ?High Priority Immunology Grant (R01)? mechanism as it is research investigating the immunological mechanisms of autoimmune disease pathogenesis using well-defined human cohorts, high resolution immunophenotyping and systems immunology. These studies will advance our understanding of how subtle alterations in IL-6 signaling, contribute to the development and potentiation of autoimmunity."
"9303976","7. Abstract  The field of developmental cancer therapeutics is at an exciting juncture. The major advances in the understanding of molecular defects leading to cancer progression and chemoresistance, together with the dramatic increase in the available molecular targeting drugs, provide unprecedented opportunities to develop potentially useful combination therapies. The scientific pursuit is further aided by the recent FDA decision to allow clinical testing of combinations involving more than one unapproved drugs.  The newer agents target steps in signaling pathways that control gene expression, including inhibitors of binding of growth factors to their receptors and inhibitors of such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The more recent introduction of RNAi agents provides additional opportunity for gene silencing on the post- transcriptional level. The goal of this project is to develop the concept (mathematical framework) and methods for combining agents that modulate different steps in a signaling cascade, with the goal of achieving true synergy or clinical synergy. We propose three aims, using Wnt/?-catenin/survivin signaling as the model pathway. This pathway plays multiple important roles in cancer development and chemoresistance.  The first aim is to establish interactive pharmacodynamic models (IPM) on combinations of agents targeting pre- and the post-transcriptional signaling events. These models are used with the single agent PD parameter values (slope, Emax, EC50, selected from literature values and from experimental data in Aim 3) to simulate the results of different combinations. The in silico results are analyzed with the method developed in Aim 2 to identify synergistic, additive or antagonistic combinations for experimental validation in Aim 3.  The second aim is to develop a method that quantifies, with statistical certainty, the interactivity among drugs with parallel or non-parallel concentration-effect curves. The third aim is to obtain experimental validation of model predictions. The first objective is obtain in cultured cells the PD parameter values for single agents directed at several pre- and post-transcriptional steps in Wnt/?-catenin/survivin signaling (e.g., antibody against Frizzled, siRNAs (against Disheveled, PP2A, survivin), and a small molecule drug OHL (which was found to reduce ?-catenin/survivin signaling). The effectors include wild type survivin mRNA and protein levels, levels of total and the active non-phosphorylated ?-catenin, and Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity. The second objective is to evaluate if the model-predicted interactivity is achieved in vitro and in vivo.  Potential gains are three-fold. First, the results will assist the development of combinations targeting multiple steps in a signaling pathway. Second, in view of the critical roles of the Wnt/?-catenin/survivin signaling in tumor development, the results will further yield insights on its modulations for therapeutic gains. Third, overcoming the survivin-mediated chemoresistance, a major cause of treatment failures, will improve the efficacy of chemotherapy."

We provide evidence that L-type calcium influx is necessary for the constitutive expression of  smooth muscle-specific differentiation markers (SMX: e.g. SMMHC, SMaA) and that exercise can increase  L-type calcium channel function in coronary smooth muscle (CSM). The general aim of this proposal is to  determine the mechanism(s) by which exercise training limits CSM phenotype switching during  atherosclerosis. The overall hypothesis is that calcium influx via L-type, voltage-gated calcium channels (L-VGCC)  stabilizes CSM in a differentiated, contractile phenotype. Conversely, dedifferentiation and  proliferation are stimulated by upregulation of intermediate-conductance K channels (IK) and store-operated  calcium channels (SOC). Exercise training prevents CSM phenotypic switching by maintaining L-VGCC  activity and subsequent SM-specific, calcium-dependent gene expression. The Specific Aims are:1)  Determine the effect of atherosclerosis on CSM ion channel functional expression, 2) Determine the effect of  atherosclerosis on intracellular calicum regulation by membrane potential, 3) Determine the effect of L-type  VGCC- versus IK/SOC-mediated calcium influx on calcium-dependent transcription factors and SMX and 4)  Determine whether exercise training can prevent the loss of L-type VGCC-mediated SMX. Early and  advanced models of atherosclerosis will be produced in swine by dietary high-fat, high-cholesterol (HFC) or  balloon injury. Both in vitro and in vivo measures of CSM phenotype will be determined using molecular,  cellular and in vivo coronary angiography techniques. The proposed research will provide the first  mechanistic link between coronary ion channel activity and CSM phenotype switching. Furthermore, it will  provide the first mechanistic examination of the role of CSM in the cardioprotective effect of exercise."

"8114833","Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) mediates the release of Ca from intracellular stores by interacting with a family of  highly conserved receptors which contain an intrinsic Ca release channel. The InsP3 receptor (InsP3R) shares both  structural and sequence similarities with the ryanodine receptor (RyR), the primary Ca release channel of the  sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in cardiac and skeletal muscle. The type-2 InsP3R is the predominant isoform expressed  in cardiac myocytes, but its localization and function in heart have been elusive. In ventricular myocytes the InsP3R2 is  targeted to the nuclear envelope and it interacts with Ca-calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). A goal of  this project is to identify and characterize proteins interacting with the InsP3R2 expressed in cardiac myocytes that are  critical for function and modulation of local Ca signaling events (regarding both regulation of InsP3R by CaMKII and  regulation of CaMKII by Ca release from InsP3R). The central focus encompasses detailed study of InsP3R2/CaMKIIdelta interactions and the functional consequences with respect to Ca signaling and nuclear signaling in hypertrophy & heart failure. A second emphasis is the characterization, use and further development of novel FRET-based biosensors for  in situ measurement of InsP3 liberation and concentration.  There are 5 Specific Aims in this project that will address the InsP3R2/CaMKII interaction and function.  1) Test the hypothesis that the InsP3R2 localized to the nuclear envelope of cardiac myocytes interacts with CaMKII  and forms a macromolecular complex.  2) Test the hypothesis that the interaction of CaMKII directly modulates the InsP3R2 Ca release channel properties.  3) Determine the physiological consequences of perturbing or disrupting the InsP3R2-CaMKII interaction.  4) Test the hypothesis that the spatial/temporal patterns of expression levels for the InsP3Rs are altered during ES cell  development, hypertrophy and heart failure.  5) Generate a biological sensors to measure the free concentration of InsP3 in an intact cells.  These studies will provide considerable new information regarding InsP3R in cardiac myocytes in health and disease.  This is especially the case with respect to localization, molecular partners and regulation of function. Additionally, we  anticipate that the InsP3-biosensors will become important new tools in the InsP3 field. This work is highly synergistic  with all three other projects in the Program Project Grant."

"9481393","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cholangiopathies (Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) and Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC)) are characterized by the proliferation/loss of cholangiocytes, which are the cells that line the biliary epithelium. During cholestasis, biliary hyperplasia/damage is regulated by both autocrine/paracrine mechanisms. For example, during hyperplastic cholangiocyte proliferation bile duct mass increases and proliferating cholangiocytes release numerous factors like histamine presumably to sustain the increased bile duct mass. In ductopenic states, bile duct mass decreases and cholangiocytes are damaged and unable to maintain biliary homeostasis. We have shown that: (i) cholangiocytes express histamine receptors (HRs) and histidine decarboxylase (HDC), the key enzyme regulating histamine synthesis; (ii) cholangiocytes release histamine; and (iii) inhibition of biliry HDC decreases both hyperplastic and neoplastic cholangiocyte growth and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by autocrine pathways. Besides the autocrine regulation of cholangiocyte proliferation/loss, paracrine regulation of biliary function by neighboring hepatic cells must be considered. It has been demonstrated in patients with PBC and PSC that histamine plasma levels are higher and that there are increased numbers of hepatic mast cells in the proximity of bile ducts. When activated, hepatic mast cells release numerous factors like histamine into the microenvironment, which we propose influence cholangiocyte proliferative/apoptotic responses in cholangiopathies. In our proposal, we present preliminary data supporting the hypothesis that mast cells infiltrate the liver following damage via c-kit/SCF interaction and that mast cells alte the proliferative response of small and large cholangiocytes in models of liver damage or repair by interaction with H1 and H2 HRs and specific microRNAs. Our proposed studies are innovative and will likely provide important, clinically relevant data to add to the understanding f the regulation of biliary disorders and also offer insight into novel treatment strategies."

"9227306","Project Summary  Signaling by the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway plays a key role in the patterning and growth of many tissues in the embryo and defects in Hh signaling have profound pathological effects during embryonic development and during postnatal life. While we now have a very good understanding of both the mechanism by which Hh signals are transduced and the way in which Hh signaling controls cell fate and proliferation, there are many facets of this process that are unknown or have yet to be investigated. One example is the possibility that as cells respond to Hh signals differently depending on their cell cycle phase, a phenomenon we refer to as cell cycle gating. As cells progress through the cell cycle, they experience major changes with respect to cell volume, protein content, DNA content and organization of the cytoskeleton. Thus, it is reasonable to speculate that such large changes in cellular context would impact a cell's ability to respond to signaling proteins. Indeed, our preliminary data suggest that specific phases/subphases of the cell cycle are more or less permissive in terms of their transcriptional responses to Hh signals.  The experiments proposed in Aim 1 will determine whether cell cycle gating of Hh transcriptional responses occurs at the level of the Hh signal transduction machinery and they will indicate the step in the pathway where cell cycle-gated inputs have their effects. In other experiments (Aim 2), we will determine how cell cycle progression affects transcriptional responses of all Hh targets. At the end of the project, we will have a much greater understanding of the importance of the cell cycle in controlling this pathway at both the mechanistic and transcriptome levels.   "
"9408987","ABSTRACT  The objectives of the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP) project are to create a kidney tissue atlas, define disease subgroups, and identify critical cells, pathways and targets for novel therapies by obtaining and evaluating kidney biopsies from participants with acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). As part of this effort, there is a need for new technologies that improve the safety of the human kidney biopsy as well as the quality and diagnostic yield so that the biopsy tissue yields useful research or clinical information. Ultrasound-guided kidney biopsy is a critically important tool in the evaluation and management of renal pathologies. The goal of this Phase I SBIR proposal is to develop a virtual simulator to train clinicians to improve procedural skill competence in real-time ultrasound-guided renal biopsy.  Although improvements in needle design and ultrasound imaging have been helpful, excellent biopsy technique and skill are essential to consistently obtaining high yield renal biopsy samples. Furthermore, poor renal biopsy technique can potentially lead to significant complications and adverse lethal outcomes. The simulator proposed in this project will accelerate the training of ultrasound-guided renal biopsy in a risk-free environment, ultimately improving the safety of kidney biopsy and ensuring that the biopsy procedure yields high quality specimen that can provide useful clinical information.  The proposed system will benefit radiologists, nephrologists, and interventional radiologists in two ways: (a) Improved three dimensional and dynamic ultrasound imaging interpretation specific to performing a needle biopsy and (b) Improved manual dexterity in needle handling with the aid of tactile feedback. This project is a collaboration between Kitware Inc. and Children's National Medical Center. Kitware is a leader in the creation and support of state-of-the-art software and technology with more than 15 years of experience in image-guided interventions. Children's National Medical Center (CNMC) is an internationally recognized pediatric hospital with extensive expertise in the clinical management of renal pathologies. The two institutions have already collaborated successfully on several projects including image guided biopsy projects. The aims of the Phase I project are to build the virtual simulator system and evaluate it by conducting a study with pediatric radiologists, nephrologists, and interventional radiologists at CNMC. The successful completion of the Phase I work will result in a proof of concept of our simulator system and lay the groundwork for further system development and validation in Phase II."
"9344996","1 The long-term functional implication of in utero and postnatal highly active antiretroviral therapy  2 (HAART) exposures for perinatally human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) exposed or infected children in  3 school-age and beyond is unknown. Recent data from the US pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study  4 (PHACS) finds that perinatally HIV exposed and perinatally HIV infected children have cognitive test  5 scores in the low range of normal but did not find significant cognitive deficit for HIV-exposed  6 unexposed children with and without in utero HAART. Almost no data on this subject is available for  7 children from sub-Saharan Africa where an estimated 1.4 million children per year are exposed to  8 iatrogenic HAART during sensitive periods of neural, physical and social development.  9 Perinatally HIV exposed or infected children contend with a steady stream of physiologic and 10 psychosocial stressors in utero, early childhood and throughout their life course. These stressors occur 11 during sensitive periods of development and may be associated with medium to long-term functional 12 deficits. For example, academic achievement and psychosocial adjustment represent common standards 13 by which individual success is measured in childhood and adolescence. Appropriate development in 14 these areas is closely linked to overall academic attainment and future capacity to productively contribute 15 to the society as an adult. For perinatally HIV infected adolescents, there is a simultaneous exectation 16 that they progressively take charge of managing their chronic health condition through consistent 17 adherence to HAART regimen and gaining competence in navigating the healthcare system. These 18 capacities require a robust executive cognitive function and appropriate psychosocial adjustment. 19 To inform knowledge gaps, and contribute new data on long-term differences in functional 20 outcomes (i.e. cognitive development, psychosocial adjustment and quality of life) for perinatally HIV 21 exposed and infected compared to perinatally HIV unexposed children, we evaluate HIV status related 22 differences in functional outcomes in a cohort of 11-18 years old Ugandan children with and without 23 perinatal HIV exposure/infection. We specifically assess psychosocial and physiologic stress ? measured 24 as a composite of dysregulations across multiple organ systems, as mediators of any HIV-related deficits 25 in functional impairment. By design we distinguish between functional outcomes for HIV exposed or 26 infected children in comparison to perinatally HIV unexposed children from the same community. This 27 study is therefore positioned to provide a comprehensive and robust assessment of HIV specific impact 28 on functional indicators in school-age and adolescence. Data arising from this investigation will inform 29 the nature of possible remedial interventions required to optimize the long-term functional status of 30 perinatally HIV exposed or infected children and adolescents."

"8114769","Exercise training (EX) increases coronary blood flow capacity and alters coronary vasomotor responsiveness  in normal animals. Endothelium-dependent dilation (EDO) is blunted in the left anterior descending coronary  artery (LAD) of sedentary pigs (SED) with early stage coronary artery disease (CAD) produced by feeding a high  fat/cholesterol diet for 5 months (HFC). EX of this HFC model of CAD restores EDO in the LAD. These  interactive effects of EX and HFC diet form the foundation for the central hypothesis of Project 3: The beneficial  effects of EX in prevention and treatment of CAD are mediated by restoration/maintenance of a normal  coronary endothelialphenotype. Aim 1 will determine mechanisms responsible for EX-induced improvements  in EDO of LADs of HFC pigs. Preliminary results indicate that EX preserves/restores EDO in HFC pigs by  increasing availability of endothelium-derived NO and decreasing production of a cyclooxygenase constrictor  substance. We will use pharmacological, biochemical and molecular approaches to determine whether these  modifications result from altered expression of genes for enzymes/receptors responsible for EDO and/or altered  activity of these enzymes. Aim 2 will determine whether mechanical signals (shear stress and stretch) produce  EX like changes in expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and other protective genes in normal  and diseased coronary arteries. In Aim 3 we will determine whether EX produces a more atheroprotective  phenotype of endothelial and/or foam cells during early development of CAD. We will use biochemical,  molecular and morphologic approaches to characterize the phenotypes of vascular cells in SED and EX arteries.  Aim 4 experiments are designed to use genetically modified pigs (that over express eNOS and eNOS knock-out)  to determine the role of eNOS in the interactive effects of EX and HFC on endothelial function and CAD.  Available results indicate that much of the beneficial effects of EX on CAD are mediated by changes in NO  release from eNOS. Aim 5 will use the protocols and techniques applied to our model of early CAD to test the  hypothesis that EX also has beneficial effects on more advanced disease (2 yrs on the HFC diet). Completion  of the research proposed in Project 3 will improve understanding of mechanisms for anti-atherogenic effects  of EX on endothelial function and phenotype in coronary arteries and the roles of inflamation, shear stress, and  distention in producing or sustaining an anti-atherogenic phenotype of endothelial and foam cells in the arterial  wall. This research will provide a solid fundamental basis for understanding the effects of EX in  preventing/reversing CAD and for an improved ability to use exercise in treating and prevention of CAD."
"9526246","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Imaging mitochondrial signaling in beta cells (? cells) ectopically implanted in the eye.  In the last 20 years, it became clear that defects in the mitochondrial energy producing system, either genetic or toxin-induced, cause many different phenotypes. Therefore, defects in one of the five mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes likely trigger distinct signaling pathways, which differentially affect specific cell types. This team will use mouse models with specific defects in complexes I, III or IV to explore enzyme-specific signaling events in mitochondrial disorders. A novel model will be used to test this hypothesis in a dynamic, real-time platform. The approach will involve implanting ? cells in the anterior chamber of the mouse eye, which allows for the use of imaging techniques to follow both cellular and mitochondrial function as well as its signaling patterns in  vascularized environment akin to the in vivo situation. This is a multiple Principal Investigator application that will use the expertise of the group of Dr. Alejandro Caicedo (?-cell implant model, imaging physiological biomarkers) and the group of Dr. Carlos Moraes (mitochondrial physiology and mouse models of OXPHOS defects) to tease out signaling signatures associated with defects (genetic or toxin-induced) in specific OXPHOS complexes."

"9407701","Project Summary/Abstract Effective communication intervention depends on reliable tools for identifying communication concerns and tracking changes in skills. Established tools for detecting and tracking skills in early intentional communicators (i.e., directing a behavior such as reaching toward an adult to convey a message) involve communication temptations and assessing a wide variety of child behaviors in response to those dynamic temptations. While these tools have been normed for typically developing children and used for intervention tracking with intentional communicators, they can only be used to detect the absence of such skills in pre-intentional communicators and do not reflect changes in essential skills that support the development of intentional communication. There are no available normed assessments that provide dynamic and comprehensive data on pre-intentional communication and reflect evidence-based procedures to assess skills and track treatment progress in children and adults older than 12 months. If we can assess comprehensive skills that promote intentional communication in children and adults, we can intervene in skills that are essential foundations of all other communication and reduce the likelihood of secondary behavioral or adaptive impairments that affect communication and life skills. The plan for this project is to develop a comprehensive, skill progressive, sensitive, dynamic, and modality-independent assessment to detect and track communication skills in older children and adults who are basic pre-intentional communicators (Basic Social and Communication Behavior Scales; BSCBS). Initial testing showed that the pilot BSCBS (adapted from the PI?s successful development of the ISCBS assessment for infants 2-12 mo.) is an effective tool to measure changes in pre- intentional communication after intervention for children with ASD and/or DD. Consistent assessment of pre- intentional communication in older children and adults could justify focused intervention strategies to address these essential skills for older children and adults. who have an expected prognosis for long-term communication impairment and avoid denial of services to individuals who are presumed to lack supposed prerequisites of communication. We will develop and test proof-of-concept for the BSCBS to assess and track pre-intentional communication in basic communicators of all ages over 12 months for children and adults with severe developmental or acquired disabilities, test reliability and validity for communication assessment, and use pre/post assessments to track treatment progress using the BSCBS to address these specific aims: Develop BSCBS to assess pre-intentional communication skills for children and adults beyond 12 months of age; develop BSCBS components, clusters, and a composite of domains that show skill progression by developmental age in children and adults with disabilities comparable to ISCBS score patterns; establish the efficacy of the BSCBS at tracking changes in pre-intentional communication skills following intervention."
"9295957","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary The purpose of this proposal is to re-establish a T32 training program in musculoskeletal biology at Indiana University School of Medicine. The objective of the training program is to capitalize on the IU Bone Group's scientific depth, mentoring skills, and experience to provide PhD students and postdoctoral fellows with a rich, diverse, multidisciplinary training environment in skeletal biology. The program will equip them with tools and training needed to move into successful careers as physicians, scientists, and engineers who will find new cures, develop new therapeutic treatments, and generate new devices to reduce and/or eliminate musculoskeletal disease. We have enlisted 23 participating IU training faculty to serve as mentors in this program. Our training faculty collectively span the spectrum of focus areas in skeletal science, including bone cancer and metastasis, sex hormone signaling, phosphate metabolism, biomechanics, molecular and cellular biology of bone cells, fracture healing, mechanisms of drug action, calcitropic hormones, mechanotransduction, skeletal genetics, human skeletal disease, matrix properties, cartilage biology, muscle biology, and developmental biology, among others. This group of faculty has a strong training record and has over $10M of external funding this year from the federal agencies (e.g. NIH, DOD, VA) as PIs. For the proposed 5-year duration of this program, support for 3 pre- and 3 post-doctoral trainees is requested. We have carefully crafted individual training programs for predoctoral students and postdoctoral fellows that are designed to expose trainees to a cross-disciplinary approach to skeletal research, while allowing them to focus on a particular set of research questions. Pre-doctoral students will take our in-house Basic Bone Biology course and the Responsible Conduct of Research course as part of the degree requirements; attend weekly Bone Journal Club and the monthly Bone and Mineral Club lecture series, conduct a portion of their doctoral research in an associate mentor's laboratory; attend one professional meeting per year; and attend at least one grant writing workshop that is held annually on campus. Postdoctoral fellows will engage in a similar program, but many (but not all) of the listed activities will be recommended rather than required, since postdoctoral fellows lack degree requirements. The training program is sensitive to the issue of diversity and will make every effort to recruit underrepresented minorities into the program. By training in an environment and culture that gives strong multi-disciplinary support for musculoskeletal research, there is a significant probability that the trainees will sustain a keen interest in skeltal biology, even as their specific research interests evolve over their careers."
"9457528","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Overall Component This project supports continued funding for the National Xenopus Resource (NXR) located at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA and identified as one of two top priorities for the Xenopus community. The NXR was established in 2010 to serve as a national resource for researchers working with the Xenopus amphibian model system, which includes two species Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis. The NXR serves as a national repository for community-generated animal stocks as well as serving as an advanced training venue that greatly facilitates productivity for a multitude of researchers. It is a community-oriented resource center that serves all Xenopus researchers, including individuals from large research-focused universities to small liberal arts colleges. As biological research becomes ever more complex, often requiring specialized animal lines and involving diverse technologies, individual laboratory units become insufficient to meet all of the demands required for addressing significant biological problems and a centralized repository or stock center becomes essential. There are five main aims to this grant. First, the NXR will maintain current stocks of frogs as well as obtain new lines making them available to the community; this includes special inbred, wild type and mutant lines of both species. In the second aim we outline the NXR custom research services for creating transgenic and mutant animals that are offered to the research community. In the third aim we outline the resources that we have created for the Xenopus community that helps to facilitate the use of new techniques in the community. These resources benefit from the excellent MBL facilities for research, teaching and housing. This includes the development of new advanced training workshops taught by experts in each field that serve to teach and propagate specialized techniques; this includes workshops on bioinformatics, imaging, genome editing, transgenesis and husbandry. In this aim we also outline the research hotel service, which provides opportunities for researchers to come to the MBL for short-term visits and use NXR resources. The last two aims are focused on applied research. In Aim 4 we describe new transgenic technology and enhancement of the new genome editing technology. In the last aim we propose to optimize sperm cryopreservation in X. laevis and develop a new health screening PCR service to test for the presence of specific pathogens."
"9311953","Over 30,000 people per year undergo craniofacial resective surgery and approximately 15% of the US population suffers from periodontal disease severe enough to warrant surgery (Marolt 2015). Currently, craniofacial and periodontal bone tissue engineering faces unique challenges due to the exposure of cranial and periodontal bones to continuous and varying loads (Rah 2000). The effect of continuous loads onto the engineered construct necessitates a gradual augmentation of an engineered regenerate rather than the en bloc insertion of a mechanically inert replacement tissue. In contrast to long bones, which are formed through endochondral ossification, cranial vault and periodontal bones are characterized by their unique mode of intramembranous ossification, which is accomplished through the stepwise mineralization of a specialized extracellular protein matrix rich in collagen and proteoglycans. When cranial and/or periodontal bones are lost due to trauma or disease, this loss not only affects osteoblasts, progenitors, and other bone cells, but also the unique extracellular bone matrix that maintains the instructive signaling environment for continuous bone regeneration and replacement. In the present application we have focused on a recently described small molecule mediator, the SETD7 histone lysine methyltransferase inhibitor PFI-2 that in our preliminary studies has induced osteoblasts to secrete a typical bone-like extracellular matrix enriched in collagen, fibronectin and osteocalcin. In animal studies, PFI-2 has demonstrated extraordinary potential to induce bone regeneration, including alveolar bone regeneration over half of a tooth root?s length and more than 50% new bone coverage of critical size cranial defects. Providing a possible mechanism for these exciting new findings, we have demonstrated that PFI-2 inhibited SETD7 mediated ?-catenin methylation, resulting in nuclear ?-catenin translocation and bone matrix protein transcription activation in addition to the stimulation of other processes related to new bone formation, such as cell proliferation and differentiation. In the present application, we seek to exploit PFI-2?s potential for cranial and periodontal bone regeneration, define the mechanism(s) by which PFI-2 triggers new bone extracellular matrix deposition, and engineer scaffolds of sufficient stability to provide a template for PFI-2 nanosphere controlled release toward future applications in clinical use and patient care."
"8988580","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Host and symbiont determinants of colonization by a co-evolved gut community Project Summary Host-specific gut bacteria are central to the biology and health of animals, but elucidating the processes that govern normal and atypical assembly of gut communities is challenging. Most gut communities, and specifically those of humans, are dauntingly complex; whereas others, such as that of Drosophila, have variable compositions dominated by opportunistic bacterial species from other environments. In the honey bee (Apis mellifera), the ileum region of the hindgut contains a dense but simple community dominated by only three specialized bacterial species that comprise >95% of bacteria despite the continual entry of diverse environmental microbes present in food. These three species are found only in bee guts, and distinct but related strains are found in related bee species. Our pilot work established axenic culture conditions, official nomenclature, and reference strains for all bee gut community members, transposon-based mutagenesis methods, protocols for controlling colonization with specific isolates or mutants, and methods for quantitative description of community composition. Furthermore, the host is amenable to genetic studies: sequenced genome and associated resources are available for the honey bee, and RNAi methods have been established. Building on these foundations, we will use the honey bee ileum as a model gut community to determine the specific bacterial and host factors that underlie the establishment of a persistent gut community characteristic of a host species. We will use expression analyses and genome-wide mutagenesis and mutant screening based on high-throughput sequencing to identify symbiont genes affecting colonization of the bee ileum and to elucidate the effects of host genes and pathways on colonization. We will examine how a focal pioneer symbiont influences the assembly and subsequent composition of the gut community. This will be achieved by monitoring succession in experimental gut communities and by identifying symbiont genes that affect colonization by other bacterial species and strains, including both the symbionts normally present in the community and the opportunistic or pathogenic bacteria that are typically excluded. These results will reveal host and symbiont-based processes that govern development of a normal, host- specific gut microbiota and will illuminate how and why gut communities sometimes develop abnormally, to the detriment of host health."
"9398706","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is a common risk factor that predisposes subjects to an array of mental disorders, particularly drug addiction. Due to elusive understanding of PAE-elicited neuroadaptations, available options to prevent and treat PAE-induced disorders are limited. In this proposed research, a three-part hypothesis regarding the synaptic mechanisms by which PAE affects risk for addictions in later life will be evaluated. The first part of this hypothesis stipulates that a major glutamatergic pathway, originating in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and directly influencing the principal neuronal population in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), the medium-sized spiny neurons (MSNs), is targeted by PAE to promote addiction development. Additionally, sub-regions of the mPFC target distinct compartments of the NAc, with the infralimbic mPFC (IL) preferentially projecting to the NAc shell and the prelimbic mPFC (PrL) to the NAc core; a second feature of our hypothesis is the idea that PAE-induced synaptic alterations are pathway/projection-specific. The third component of our hypothesis postulates that PAE leads to aberrant synaptic development in the NAc by accelerating the pruning/maturation of silent synapses (SSs), thought to be immature glutamatergic synapses containing stable NMDA receptors (NMDARs) but lacking stable AMPA receptors (AMPARs), and that this abnormal maturational process results from the recruitment of atypical Ca2+-permeable (CP)-AMPARs in the MSNs. Based upon our preliminary data, we predict that (1) Maturation/pruning of SSs is accelerated in the IL- shell projections but not PrL-core from rats subjected to PAE, compared to control animals (prenatal control exposure, PCE), (2) PAE affects the maturation/pruning of SSs via the recruitment of atypical CP-AMPARs, rather than the typical Ca2+-impermeable (CI)-AMPARs into excitatory synapses on MSNs in the NAc, and (3) PAE predisposes animals to heightened drug-seeking, an effect that can be reversed by manipulating PAE- induced SS-based synaptic alterations in the specific excitatory innervation to the NAc. These hypotheses will be tested employing state-of-the-art techniques including whole-cell patch clamp, intravenous self-administration, optogenetics, single-cell staining and spine labeling. The outcome of this work will provide a novel and precise approach to understanding the neural mechanisms underlying PAE-induced mental disorders such as substance abuse, and to discovering novel biological targets for treatment."
"9301661","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term goals of this research are to quantify patient-specific changes in neuromuscular control in order to optimize treatment planning and improve mobility for individuals with cerebral palsy (CP). As a first step, the aims of this proposl are to evaluate neuromuscular control before and after one of the most common treatments for individuals with CP, orthopaedic surgery. We will evaluate if patient-specific measures of neuromuscular control, based upon the framework of muscle synergies, can predict improvements in walking ability after surgery. Further, we will determine whether neuromuscular control changes after surgery and if these changes contribute to improvements in movement. To achieve these goals we will implement and test new tools to quantify neuromuscular control which integrate clinical gait analysis and two computational techniques: synergy analysis and dynamic musculoskeletal simulation. Our prior research has demonstrated that individuals with CP use fewer synergies during gait than unimpaired individuals and that synergies are associated with changes in walking ability after a variety of treatments. In Aim 1, we will prospectively evaluate if synergies predict outcomes after orthopaedic surgery. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the adaptability of synergies by evaluating whether synergies change after orthopaedic surgery. In Aim 3 we will use musculoskeletal simulation to evaluate how altered synergies impact muscle recruitment, impaired movement, and energy costs of walking for three of the most common pathologic gait patterns in CP: crouch gait, stiff-knee gait, and equinus gait. Musculoskeletal simulation provides a unique tool to probe patient-specific changes in neuromuscular control because we can specify and evaluate different control strategies and impairments in silico. For example, we can use a patient's experimentally measured kinematics and kinetics from clinical gait analysis to simulate their specific gait pattern and examine the impact of different control strategies. We will use a new algorithm we developed in OpenSim, an open-source platform for musculoskeletal modeling, to create simulations with synergy-based control. The outcomes of this research will quantify changes in neuromuscular control in CP and evaluate the clinical utility of synergy analysis. This research will provide the foundation to use measures of altered neuromuscular control to inform treatment planning, develop alternative treatments, and improve mobility in CP and other neurologic disorders."
"9277465","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The level of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is a key modifier of the clinical severity of the ?-hemoglobin disorders sickle cell disease and ?-thalassemia. The goal of this proposal is to identify mechanisms that regulate HbF level and could serve as rational targets for efforts to re-induce HbF for the ?-hemoglobin disorders. Genome- wide association studies (GWASs) have identified BCL11A as a critical HbF-associated locus. Functional studies have demonstrated that BCL11A is a bona fide repressor of ?-globin transcription. Naturally occurring common genetic variation modulates an erythroid-specific enhancer of BCL11A. Our prior studies identified the GWAS-marked erythroid enhancer of BCL11A as the substrate for common genetic variation associated with HbF level. Genome editing has revealed critical sequences within this enhancer required for HbF repression in the adult stage. I hypothesize that these sequences recruit critical trans-acting factors, which themselves are required for suppressing HbF levels. In addition, I hypothesize that other critical sequences at the BCL11A and HBS1L-MYB loci are required to repress HbF in the adult-stage. To test these hypotheses, I will: (1) utilize a high-resolution, high-throughput genome editing approach to identify non-coding sequences at BCL11A and HBS1L-MYB associated with HbF level; and (2) define trans-acting factors that physically and functionally interact with critical on-coding sequences at BCL11A and HBS1L-MYB. I expect that accomplishment of these aims will not only deepen our current understanding of cis- and trans-acting determinants of developmental regulation of globin gene expression but also yield novel insights to guide therapeutic efforts for HbF re-induction."
"8114777","Exercise training (EX) increases coronary blood flow capacity and alters coronary vasomotor responsiveness  in normal animals. Endothelium-dependent dilation (EDO) is blunted in the left anterior descending coronary  artery (LAD) of sedentary pigs (SED) with early stage coronary artery disease (CAD) produced by feeding a high  fat/cholesterol diet for 5 months (HFC). EX of this HFC model of CAD restores EDO in the LAD. These  interactive effects of EX and HFC diet form the foundation for the central hypothesis of Project 3: The beneficial  effects of EX in prevention and treatment of CAD are mediated by restoration/maintenance of a normal  coronary endothelialphenotype. Aim 1 will determine mechanisms responsible for EX-induced improvements  in EDO of LADs of HFC pigs. Preliminary results indicate that EX preserves/restores EDO in HFC pigs by  increasing availability of endothelium-derived NO and decreasing production of a cyclooxygenase constrictor  substance. We will use pharmacological, biochemical and molecular approaches to determine whether these  modifications result from altered expression of genes for enzymes/receptors responsible for EDO and/or altered  activity of these enzymes. Aim 2 will determine whether mechanical signals (shear stress and stretch) produce  EX like changes in expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and other protective genes in normal  and diseased coronary arteries. In Aim 3 we will determine whether EX produces a more atheroprotective  phenotype of endothelial and/or foam cells during early development of CAD. We will use biochemical,  molecular and morphologic approaches to characterize the phenotypes of vascular cells in SED and EX arteries.  Aim 4 experiments are designed to use genetically modified pigs (that over express eNOS and eNOS knock-out)  to determine the role of eNOS in the interactive effects of EX and HFC on endothelial function and CAD.  Available results indicate that much of the beneficial effects of EX on CAD are mediated by changes in NO  release from eNOS. Aim 5 will use the protocols and techniques applied to our model of early CAD to test the  hypothesis that EX also has beneficial effects on more advanced disease (2 yrs on the HFC diet). Completion  of the research proposed in Project 3 will improve understanding of mechanisms for anti-atherogenic effects  of EX on endothelial function and phenotype in coronary arteries and the roles of inflamation, shear stress, and  distention in producing or sustaining an anti-atherogenic phenotype of endothelial and foam cells in the arterial  wall. This research will provide a solid fundamental basis for understanding the effects of EX in  preventing/reversing CAD and for an improved ability to use exercise in treating and prevention of CAD."
"9282793","PROJECT SUMMARY The therapeutic benefit of transfusion presumes a direct correlation between blood oxygen carrying capacity and oxygen delivery. However, studies have shown that stored blood loses its ability to oxygenate tissues. The sequelae that can occur after transfusion (renal injury, myocardial infarction, death) are consistent with the idea that banked blood may exacerbate rather than correct anemia-induced hypoxia. We have discovered that banked blood has markedly diminished levels of nitric oxide/S-nitrosothiol (NO/SNO) bioactivity including reduced amounts of the S-nitrosylated form of hemoglobin (SNO-Hb), a major mediator of blood flow and peripheral oxygen delivery. This decline in SNO provides a mechanistic basis for the impaired vasodilatory activity of stored red blood cells (RBCs) and an explanation for why transfusion of even small amounts of blood may impair tissue perfusion. We have built on this novel finding by demonstrating that restoration of SNO-Hb levels (renitrosylation) corrects storage-induced deficiencies in RBC oxygen delivery and transfusion-induced organ dysfunction in multiple preclinical transfusion paradigms, and we have initiated clinical studies to assess the effects of transfusion on human tissue oxygenation. We have also developed first-in-class renitrosylating agents that are already undergoing clinical testing. We are positioned to provide critically needed data on the effects of transfusion on tissue oxygenation in humans and to advance the benefits of renitrosylation therapy on oxygen delivery through the following aims:  1. To advance understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which RBCs deploy SNO-based signals to  regulate tissue oxygenation in fresh and stored blood.  2. To develop a device for ex vivo renitrosylation.  3. To determine if the physiologic responses to transfusion with renitrosylated RBCs are superior to  untreated banked blood in a preclinical trauma model.  4. To conduct an autologous standard flow (i.e. non-trauma) transfusion study in humans with and without  renitrosylation to delineate the physiologic effects of transfusion and the benefits of increased/restored  SNO-Hb levels on tissue oxygenation. Collectively, our studies will provide much-needed insight into the effects of transfusion on tissue oxygenation, shed light on the mechanistic basis of adverse ischemic events associated with transfusion, and accelerate development of therapeutic approaches (repletion of SNO-Hb). Restoration of the oxygen delivery capabilities of banked blood should result in blood transfusion achieving its clinical purpose: vasodilation in the microcirculation to improve end-organ oxygen delivery in the anemic patient. To the extent that the world's supplies of banked RBCs are deficient in SNO-Hb, renitrosylation may hold significant therapeutic promise."

"9292388","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cerebral white matter is highly vulnerable to cerebral ischemia13 and white matter injury (WMI) is a major cause of functional disability in stroke, the nation's third leading cause of death and the leading cause of permanent disability. Thus, interventions targeted at WMI, an area that remains relatively understudied and poorly understood, may significantly improve post-stroke quality of life.  Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) primarily localizes in the cytosol and functions as the rate-limiting enzyme for the biosynthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)14. NAMPT is neuroprotective against cerebral ischemia15,16. In non-CNS systems, NAMPT can be found in the extracellular space (eNAMPT) and circulates systemically in the blood. Whether the CNS also has eNAMPT and the role of this eNAMPT remains unknown. In our pilot studies, we first detected that neural cells secrete NAMPT into the extracellular space and that eNAMPT, but not its intracellular counterpart (iNAMPT), is selectively induced after ischemia, implying that extracellular NAMPT may play a role in ischemia. Increased NAMPT levels are present in the extracellular space and in white matter after ischemia in neuron-specific transgenic mice. Most importantly, in addition to gray matter protection, we found that NAMPT transgenic overexpression protects against WMI after ischemia. These findings lead us to speculate that extracellular NAMPT may mediate white matter protection after ischemia. In line with this, we found that recombinant NAMPT protein protects oligodendrocytes against ischemia-like injury induced by oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) and AMPA toxicity. More importantly, we found that exogenously administered NAMPT protein can cross the blood brain barrier and protect against ischemic WMI in vivo. Further studies found that recombinant NAMPT protein protects against cell death of oligodendrocytes and its progenitor cells (OPCs) induced by ischemia, and enhances the differentiation of OPCs into mature oligodendrocytes. These findings suggest that NAMPT may directly protect against WMI via inhibiting oligodendrocyte death and enhancing the maturation of OPCs. We found that NAMPT also enhances microglial myelin phagocytosis. This is important because damaged myelin is believed to suppress the maturation of OPCs and cause demyelination in many pathological conditions. Thus NAMPT may indirectly enhance oligodendrogenesis via modulating microglial myelin phagocytosis. The objective of this project is to further test the white matter protective effect of NAMPT and its underlying mechanisms, and to develop a novel and clinically relevant therapeutic approach for white matter protection after cerebral ischemia. The central hypothesis to be tested is that NAMPT protects against WMI via enhancing oligodendrocytic protection/ regeneration and microglia-mediated myelin phagocytosis. Focal ischemia will be induced in mice by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) The following Specific Aims are proposed: Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that systemic administration of NAMPT protein protects against WMI induced by focal ischemia. The proposed study will test the potential translational value of NAMPT in treating WMI induced by focal cerebral ischemia. NAMPT recombinant protein will be administrated intraperitoneally to mice and the effect of NAMPT on ischemic brain injury will be quantitatively evaluated. The endpoints for assessment include infarct volume, WMI, and neurological outcomes. Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that NAMPT protects against WMI by inhibiting oligodendrocytic death and enhancing oligodendrogenesis after cerebral ischemia. The proposed study will test whether systemic administration of NAMPT protein reduces oligodendrocyte death after focal ischemia. We will also test whether NAMPT stimulates the regeneration of oligodendrocytes after ischemia. Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that NAMPT protects against WMI by enhancing microglial myelin phagocytosis. Two approaches will be used to elevate NAMPT levels: systemic administration of NAMPT protein and microglia-targeted NAMPT overexpression via an AAV9 vector driven by microglia/macrophage specific F4/80 promoter. The effect of NAMPT on microglial myelin phagocytosis, oligodendrogenesis, WMI, and functional outcomes after ischemia will be evaluated. PHS 398/2590 (Rev. 06/09) Page Continuation Format Page"
"9475518","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reduced layer 3 pyramidal cell dendrite length and complexity, spine density, and somal volume have been reported in multiple brain regions, including in primary auditory cortex (AI), in schizophrenia (Sz). Because these structural features are critical for signal processing, they likely underlie the correlated observations of impaired auditory processing and auditory cortex gray matter volume reductions in Sz, and contribute to disability. Dendrite length, complexity, and spine density are shaped by the effects of activity-dependent glutamate signaling on the microtubule and actin cytoskeleton; disruption of this signaling causes structural reductions similar to those in Sz. During the current funding period we have found alterations of proteins at multiple points within this pathway: presynaptic- SYN1, SYP; receptor- GRIA3; signal transduction- kalirin-9, MAP2. These findings have led us to hypothesize that glutamate signaling to the cytoskeleton is altered in AI in Sz, and contributes to the impairments in pyramidal cell structure. We now propose to test this hypothesis in an integrated set of experiments designed to delineate the specific nature of the alterations in these proteins within AI using a combination of targeted proteomics of synaptosomal preparations and quantitative fluorescent microscopy in human tissue (Aim 1 & 2); to determine the mechanisms by which these alterations may lead to morphologic changes in layer 3 pyramidal cells using over-expression and RNAi for WT and mutant kalirin-9, RhoA, RAC1 and MAP2 constructs in vitro and in layer 3 pyramidal cells in AI in vivo (Aim 3); and to place the alterations in the context of the larger glutamate signaling network in AI using targeted proteomics and network co-expression topology analyses (Aim 4). These Aims provide potential translational impact by examining proteins (i.e. possible drug-able targets) and by the integration of approaches such that alterations can be discovered, and their specificity delineated in diseased tissue, and then their mechanisms determined in model systems. Inclusion of an in vivo model provides a bridge to future studies to test interventions derived from our mechanistic findings with the goal of preventing morphologic changes in layer 3 pyramidal cells in AI and assessing the effects on auditory function."
"9332146","As the HIV research and patient communities place greater emphasis on cure strategies, there is an urgent need to understand HIV rebound and predict its kinetics. Previous trials have demonstrated that a significant majority of individuals rebound within one year of ART interruption (>85%, depending on time of therapy initiation), resulting in high viral loads and loss of CD4+ T cells.[REF SMART] Current research is focused on understanding the critical factors driving rebound, which should allow prediction of rebound kinetics in individual patients, and may suggest strategies to delay or prevent rebound. The proposed RETIRE-HIV Program will provide a framework for study of host immunologic factors that impact upon rebound in observational and interventional trials, in humans and non-human primates. The Biostatistics Core is integral to this cooperative effort, providing a coordinated, rigorous approach to the diverse datasets that will be gathered. These include results from a retrospective study of well-characterized human patients undergoing rebound (Project 1, Aim 2), a prospective cohort to be followed throughout therapeutic immunization and rebound (Project 1, Aim 3), a non-human primate study of the effects of therapeutic vaccination with a unique candidate eliciting Mamu-E-restricted responses (Project 2, Aim 2), and a non- human primate study of the effects of wild-type RhCMV infection on natural elicitation of Mamu-E-restricted responses (Project 3, Aim 3). The comprehensive and integrated biostatistical studies undertaken by this Core will ensure that a rigorous and sophisticated analysis is undertaken of each study and that results from these various experiments influence the conduct of others. Overall, the mission of the Biostatistics Core is to facilitate performance of rigorous research in each project and to provide an integrated analysis of gathered data. The functions of this core include study design, protocol and proposal development, management of research-related data management systems, data analysis and interpretation of findings, and publication of results.

"9394358","PROJECT SUMMARY:  Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is a debilitating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) that affects over 400,000 U.S. citizens and millions worldwide. RRMS is the most common non-traumatic cause of neurologic disability in young adults, with disease onset typically occurring between 20 and 30 years of age. There is no cure for RRMS, and current therapeutic strategies carry significant risk. RRMS patients develop inflammatory lesions in their brain and spinal cord characterized by massive immune cell infiltration. This process results in the destruction of myelin, a fatty sheath that encompasses neuronal axons and is important for their health and function. In addition to this demyelination, axonal damage, neuronal loss, and tissue scarring are also classic features of RRMS. These hallmarks of disease are responsible for the neurologic deficits experienced by RRMS patients, and are incited by immune cell inflammatory activity in the brain.  Myeloid cells (MC), a branch of the immune system, are known drivers of this devastating pathologic process. MC dominate the RRMS lesion and the extent of irreversible neurologic damage present is most strongly influenced by MC abundance. In vitro studies suggest that MC support inflammatory programs by increasing their metabolism of glucose, thus generating excitement about the therapeutic potential of targeting MC metabolic pathways to treat inflammatory diseases. However, this enthusiasm is tempered by the following considerations: metabolic characteristics of MC during demyelinating diseases like RRMS have yet to be elucidated, and systemic administration of metabolic inhibitors for chronic indications is unattractive. The first aim of this project is to establish the metabolic characteristics of individual MC subsets found in the demyelinating CNS. This goal is founded in preliminary data demonstrating that bulk MCs isolated directly from the demyelinating CNS upregulate glyclolytic machinery, including alternative isoforms of glycolytic enzymes that are not otherwise expressed in normal tissues. The engagement of this glycolytic profile is associated with a robust increase in inflammatory gene signature, and drugs that block these induced enzymes potently restrict the inflammatory responses of these immune cells in ex vivo systems. The second aim of this project is to pharmacologically and genetically target an isoform of a glycolytic enzyme induced during immune cell activation to treat CNS demyelination. Collectively, the results of these studies will provide significant conceptual advancements in the understanding of RRMS disease mechanisms, and may pave the way for the development of novel therapeutics to manage this debilitating disease."
"9396736","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an unpredictable, immune-mediated, inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that affects more than 2.3 million people worldwide. MS is characterized by widespread lesions in the brain and spinal cord, but the cause remains unknown and symptoms differ in each patient. Although symptoms vary widely, cognitive impairment (CI) affects up to 70% of patients with MS and is detrimental to overall quality of life. A relation between gray matter (GM) damage and CI has been supported by clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, yet GM pathology is subtle and difficult to detect using conventional T1- and T2-weighted MRI. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy has linked dysfunctional regulation of glutamate, the principle excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain GM to CI, yet suffers from poor resolution and long acquisition times. Thus, there is an unmet need to develop high-resolution, clinically-accessible MRI techniques that allow early detection of molecular changes in GM, prediction of future CI, and evaluation of treatment response in MS. Recently, amide proton transfer (APT) chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI sensitive to slowly exchanging amide protons found in proteins/peptides has been developed at 3 Tesla (3T) and investigated as a biomarker of white matter pathology in MS at 7T. Glutamate-sensitive CEST MRI has only been explored at ultra-high field strengths in preclinical studies, in healthy human brain / spinal cord, and in epilepsy but has not been applied to study MS or CI. New MRI strategies for increasing sensitivity to more rapidly exchanging amine protons, such as those of glutamate, have been described in the literature (frequency-labeled exchange transfer and variable delay multi-pulse CEST) but have not yet been optimized for clinical implementation. Leveraging these recent advances in MRI detection of exchangeable protons, the goal of this project is to develop quantitative, glutamate-sensitive MRI techniques sensitive to subtle changes in gray matter that drive CI in MS. The proposed research consists of two parts: 1) Compare and optimize MRI acquisition and analysis techniques for generating contrast related to glutamate at 7T in phantoms and healthy volunteers, and 2) test the sensitivity of the imaging techniques to pathology in cortical GM of MS patients and examine correlations between MRI-derived indices and clinical measures of CI. This work aims to provide new insights into molecular changes underlying cortical GM pathology and CI in MS through the application of glutamate-sensitive MRI in a clinical population."
"9393390","Project Summary/Abstract  Pathological growth of the heart can be separated into two categories: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, whereby the ventricles undergo thickening and cardiomyocytes increase in width, and dilated cardiomyopathy, in which the ventricular walls become thinner and cardiomyocytes lengthen. New avenues of research to broaden our understanding of cardiac growth mechanisms are critical to treating the many patients worldwide suffering from these cardiovascular diseases. The experiments outlined in this proposal seek to increase the knowledge of such mechanisms by determining how cardiomyocytes grow preferentially in length or width. MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 have long been known to regulate cell growth and proliferation in many cell types. However, adult cardiomyocytes have very low proliferative capacities; therefore, the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling pathway may be specialized in these cells to control growth. Indeed the sponsor's lab has previously found that these kinases regulate the switch between cardiomyocyte growth in different directions. When signaling through this pathway is increased, cardiomyocytes increase in width, adding sarcomeres in parallel. However, the inhibition of MEK1/2-ERK1/2 causes significant lengthening of cardiomyocytes and addition of sarcomeres in series. Canonical MEK1/2-ERK1/2 activation causes translocation of most ERK1/2 proteins to the nucleus to elicit cell growth; however, lengthening growth still occurs in cardiomyocytes when ERK1/2 do not translocate to the nucleus and remain in the cytoplasm. Therefore there are likely specific actions of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 in the cytoplasm that regulate directional growth of cardiomyocytes, namely interactions with or regulation of proteins in the cytoplasm. This proposal seeks to understand the molecular underpinnings of these kinases' actions on directional growth by first determining the spatiotemporal changes in MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 during hypertrophic stimuli. The roles that these proteins' subcellular localizations play in directing cardiomyocyte lengthening or widening will also be assessed. Proteins which directly bind MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 will be identified through yeast two-hybrid and in vivo proteomics assays. These studies are underway and have already led to the identification of a novel interaction between ERK2 and the Z-disk protein nebulette. Finally a phosphoproteomic screen was conducted to determine proteins that may not necessarily bind MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 but may be downstream effectors. The results showed an array of targets, many of which are cytoskeletal or adaptor proteins, which displayed changes in phosphorylation upon the induction or inhibition of MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling. That so many cytoskeletal proteins were affected by changes in this signaling pathway supports the hypothesis that these kinases have specific actions in the cytoplasm to modulate directional growth. Overall, these studies will greatly expand our knowledge of the mechanisms that control cardiomyocyte growth in different directions, and thereby may provide us with new therapeutic targets to manipulate in conditions of pathological cardiac growth."
"8134152","The renewal application for this project will follow-up the findings of the parent grant and previous studies  which suggest: 1) African-Americans have an impaired natriuretic response to stress; 2) this pattern is  related to the functioning of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system; and 3) is associated with the early  development of target organ damage. In addition, these studies 4) indicate increased adiposity contributes  to the pattern. Specific Aims 1 and 2 will examine the effects of an angiotensin receptor blocker on the  pressure natriuresis response to stress in African-Americans with impaired stress-induced pressure  natriuresis, confirming the role of angiotensin II in the response pattern. Furthermore, this effect will be  compared in normal weight versus overweight individuals, with a hypothesized greater effect in overweight  subjects. Aim 3 will compare the effects of an angiotensin receptor blocker between carriers and noncarriers  of a functional polymorphism of the angiotensin II receptor type 1 gene. These results will provide  additional evidence for the mechanistic role of angiotensin II and continue our gene/environmental approach  to the study of mechanisms underlying the development of hypertension. Our fourth and final aim is to test  the hypothesis that individuals who displayed impaired stress-induced pressure natriuresis on initial testing  will display greater increases in blood pressure and related target organ damage than those who displayed  normal stress-induced pressure natriuresis. This follow-up study will provide more direct evidence of the  clinical significance of impaired stress-induced pressure natriuresis.  Relevance to public health: High blood pressure, or hypertension, remains a significant health problem in  industrialized nations. The problem is particularly significant in the African-American population in whom  impaired sodium regulation plays an important role. The results of this study will help further define the  interactive effects of genetic predisposition and environmental stress on sodium handling in the development  of hypertension, particularly in overweight African-Americans. The pharmacologic interventions will also  provide evidence for effective management of this potentially clinically significant response pattern."

The majority of transcriptional profiling is conducted by RNA-seq, with samples run on either an Illumina MiSeq or an Illumina NextSeq 500 instrument. Sequencing can be tailored to yield information on mRNA, small noncoding RNA, or total RNA (mRNA and long noncoding RNA) expression. Analysis pipelines are in place for mapping reads to current sequence databases, including available nonhuman primate genomic data. The core is active in developing new methodologies and in applying transcriptomic profiling to new research areas, including analyzing the expression of MHC genes and noncoding RNAs. Microarray profiling, using the Agilent platform, is also available. 2) Provide sequencing and data processing methods for microbiome profiling. Given the increasingly recognized role of the microbiome in health and disease, microbiome profiling is becoming an important component of experimental protocols that use nonhuman primates, particularly in infectious disease and vaccine research. The Core provides bacterial 16S ribosomal gene sequencing and data processing methods for microbiome profiling. We also provide microbial RNA-seq to identify metabolically active species of bacteria. 3) Provide mass spectrometry methods for epigenetic, proteome, phosphoproteome, and metabolome profiling, in collaboration with Dr. Ben Garcia (University of Pennsylvania). Profiling of epigenetic modifications, and of protein and metabolite abundance, provides investigators with unique insights into biological systems that cannot be obtained through transcriptomic profiling alone. These data can also be used in conjunction with transcriptomic data to provide a more comprehensive view of a biological system. The Core provides sample preparation, sample fractionation, multiple mass spectrometry platforms, and a complete data analysis pipeline."

"9308945","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preeclampsia (PE) is the most common medical complication of pregnancy and affects 5-10% of pregnant women. It is the leading cause of maternal death in developing countries and premature delivery in developed nations. PE is characterized by new onset hypertension and proteinuria occurring after 20 weeks of gestation. Currently, the only treatment for PE is delivery. Recent research has shown that circulating anti-angiogenic proteins are associated with and may be involved in the pathogenesis of PE. In humans, antiangiogenic proteins (soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-sFlt1 and soluble endoglin-sEng) are elevated, while levels of pro- angiogenic proteins (Placental Growth Factor-PlGF) are reduced in women prior to the clinical signs and symptoms of PE. Another observation which is supported by rapidly accumulating data is that exposure to this anti-angiogenic milieu during the pregnancy results in significant increase in cardiovascular mortality later in life. Mechanisms of this delayed toxicity are not clear. Long-term, renal function was shown to be impaired in significant proportion of women with past history of PE with dose-response like correlation observed: exposure to severe PE or recurrent PE, higher the chance of ESRD later in life. Some biologic evidence exists, that endothelial injury and possibly epigenetic changes in the vasculature is the starting point of those sequelae. Careful dissection of the pathophysiologic processes involved will help in identification of modifiable risk factors associated with the condition as well as recognition of suitable therapeutic targets with ultimate goal to reduce the sequelae. The applicant intends to do in vivo (on rodents) studies to investigate the prior preeclampsia in the pathogenesis of long term complications such as chronic renal failure. This work will not only advance the understanding of the role of angiogenic proteins in PE, but will also provide the necessary knowledge for development of drug therapies aimed at reducing sFlt1 and sEng toxicity in microvasculature of different organs later in life. Systemic vascular health and in particular glomerular endothelial health will be evaluated in setting of PE model alone or in addition to various know cardiovascular risk factors. Effort to identify potential mechanism will be made by means of analysis of inflammatory and endothelial function profiling in the proposed experimental groups. Pharmacologic interventions will be made aimed at elucidating relevant biological pathways involved, which ultimately could lead to identification of therapeutic targets. The proposed work will be performed in the laboratory of Dr. S. Ananth Karumanchi, an expert in PE biology, in the outstanding academic and research environment of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School. The applicant is a Graduating Nephrology Fellow with rapidly developing and productive basic research background committed to research, understanding preeclampsia and reducing its impact on long term cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality. The combined expertise of mentors and collaborators will provide a unique opportunity for the applicant to achieve the goals of this project and to start a career as an independent investigator."
"9274957","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests the renewal of our major source of long-standing funding for investigating the epigenetics of pancreatic diseases. Our studies will directly extend our knowledge on common diseases, such as chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), both painful and incurable disorders of the exocrine pancreas for which effective treatments remain to be discovered. Our OVERALL OBJECTIVE is to unravel novel epigenetic mechanisms that extend oncogenic growth signals downstream from KRAS during initiation and pancreatitis-associated cancer promotion. Our preliminary data identify HP1? as a pro-oncogenic epigenetic regulator of gene activation and growth, which is overexpressed in human pancreatic cancer as well as in animal models of pancreatic carcinogenesis. We provide solid evidence that this increased level of HP1? enhances the malignant effects of the KRAS oncogene. Our CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS is that the epigenetic regulator, HP1, works downstream from KRAS to promote pancreatic cell growth by regulating the expression of proliferative gene networks induced by this oncogene. Our AIMS will test the following hypotheses: Aim 1: HP1? participates in a membrane-to-nucleus gene regulatory pathway that enhances the ability of KRAS to mediate neoplastic transformation and tumorigenesis; Aim 2: HP1? works downstream of KRAS to regulate growth-promoting gene networks; and Aim 3: HP1? inhibition ameliorates KrasG12D-mediated PDAC initiation and promotion after pancreatitis. Our design proposes molecular, cellular, and whole organism experiments using state-of-the-art methodologies. Accordingly our laboratory has developed the appropriate conceptual framework, reagents, trained personnel and has established productive collaborations. The innovative design of this proposal seeks to maximize the yield of mechanistic and rapidly translatable knowledge in this underepresented yet extremely the new promising area of epigenetics in pancreatic diseases. As new drugs targeting both the KRAS and HP1 pathways are being tested in clinical trials, this proposal builds the rationale for applying these tools to the management of patients affected with deadly pancreatic diseases, thereby bearing significant biomedical relevance."
"9318522","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cerebral palsy (CP) is one of the most prevalent and costly pediatric neurologic conditions diagnosed in the United States. Despite years of studies that have catalogued the motor impairments seen in children with CP, innovative and effective interventions have not emerged. At least part of the problem is that the majority of treatment approaches (e.g., surgical, stretching, strengthening) emphasize the musculoskeletal impairments that may affect the execution of the movement pattern, without attention to the abnormalities in sensorimotor cortical activity, which underlie the motor planning and programming that children with CP use to perform and learn motor tasks. Addressing this substantial gap is paramount, and central to our long-term research goals of developing innovative treatment strategies that have the highest probability of teaching children with CP new motor skills. To meet this goal, we have implemented an innovative scientific approach that uses high-density magnetoencephalography (MEG), diffusion-tensor imaging, and advanced human movement analysis methods to identify the neurophysiological factors that influence a child with CP's motor performance. The Specific Aims of this proposal will (1) determine how the stage-like beta and gamma sensorimotor cortical oscillations are modulated by intensively practicing a goal-directed motor task, (2) quantify how activity within the somatosensory cortices affects the sensorimotor integration processes that are necessary for learning a goal-directed motor task, and (3) quantify the relationships between the extent of activation within the sensorimotor cortices, motor behavioral improvements, and the integrity and quantity of fibers in the thalamocortical and corticospinal tracts. Briefly, our study will address these aims by quantifying the neurophysiological and motor behavioral changes that occur after practicing an isometric ankle plantarflexion target matching task. We will focus on an ankle motor task because control of the ankle joint is well recognized as playing a key role in the mobility and postural limitations seen in children with CP. Our study design consists of the collection of MEG and motor behavioral measures prior to training (baseline), after 3- days of intensive training, and a week after cessation of the training. Participants will include a cross-section of children with CP that have various levels of motor impairments (e.g., GMFCS I-IV), and a cohort of age- matched typically-developing children. Outcomes from the proposed experiments will be seminal for challenging and potentially redirecting the current rehabilitation methods that are used to teach children with CP new motor skills. Furthermore, we expect that the new neural indices of motor learning established in this proposal will provide critical insight on why some children with CP show vast improvements after therapy, whereas others are classified as non-responders. Understanding the neural mechanisms that may limit the progress of non-responders will enable us and other research groups to develop new individualized treatment strategies that will allow for all children with CP to have the best chance of learning new motor skills."
"9525676","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This U01 grant application in response to RFA - AA-12-007 for Translational Research in Alcoholic Hepatitis is to test novel therapeutic approaches and reveal new biomarkers in alcoholic hepatitis. Alcoholic hepatitis carries high mortality and the current standard therapy with steroids is suboptimal. Because the pathogenesis of alcoholic hepatitis involves complex interactions between innate immune activation, impaired intestinal permeability and activation of cellular death pathways, we hypothesize that clinically effective new therapy should include combined therapeutic approaches that target all critical components of disease pathology. Based on preclinical data in mice and human safety, we propose to compare standard of care with steroids with a combination of pentoxiphylline plus IL-1 receptor antagonist (anakinra) plus zinc treatment in patients with acute severe alcoholic hepatitis. In patients with moderate alcoholic hepatitis the efficacy of probiotic therapy will be tested against placebo. This U01 application build on the collaboration of leading scientists in alcoholic liver disease with clinical, translational and basic research expertize from the University of Massachusetts, Cleveland Clinic, University of Louisville and UT Southwestern Medical Schools with the goal to test novel therapies, discover unique disease stage- and therapeutic response-specific biomarkers using dynamic bench-to-bedside and bedside-to-bench approaches. Biomarker analyses will include serum microRNAs, unique breath and urine markers to establish new predictors of disease outcome and treatment strategies. Preclinical studies in a mouse model will test candidate compounds to inhibit complement activation and strategies through FXR activation that may prove to be clinical candidates in the latter half of the project i the clinical trial component. To enhance the scientific potential and translational impact of this consortium, the lead PIs recruited participation of leading experts for the translational projects including Victor Ambros, the discoverer of microRNAs and Charis Eng, an internationally recognized expert in integrative genomic analysis for diseases.

"9297013","Summary This project is the next step in a research program designed to understand the pathophysiology and etiology of spite sensitivity, a theory-rich construct thought to underlie persecution and suspicious behaviors. We have developed a paradigm known as the Minnesota Trust Game that uses a parametric manipulation of risky decisions to quantify participants' suspicious behaviors. This game includes trials where the partner has an opportunity to be spiteful, that is lose their own money to cause the participant to lose even more money. Spite sensitivity, then, is reflected as an unwillingness to allow partners this opportunity. We have found across patient and healthy samples that this suspicious choice correspond to global judgments of persecution, paranoia and alienation. The project examines persecution in people receiving psychiatric services and twins from the general population using this game in a functional MRI scanner. The inclusion of psychiatric patients (n=50) and monozygotic twins (n=50 matched to patients and up to n=50 of their co-twins) allows us to examine the continuity of mechanisms across these populations. The inclusion of monozygotic twins also allows us to examine etiological factors and to evaluate causality. These tools therefore provide a robust test of the hypothesis that persecution is a form of spite sensitivity, a component the RDoC construct understanding others' mental states. Spite sensitivity, in turn, relates to a functional disconnection between executive control and valuation brain networks."
"9320005","Project Summary  Despite recent advances, melanoma remains the deadliest form of skin cancer, and new therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. The MAP kinase (MAPK) and PI3K/AKT pathways are central to both disease progression and chemoresistance in melanoma, with dual targeting approaches yielding promising results that would benefit from increased target specificity and selectivity. The AKT family of serine/threonine kinases comprises three highly homologous and functionally distinct isoforms (AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3) that play unique roles in melanoma but have not yet been leveraged for isoform-specific targeting. AKT2 is an attractive candidate for therapeutic intervention, given that AKT2 mutations and AKT2 gene amplification are known mechanisms of adaptive resistance to current targeted therapies such as the BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi) Vemurafenib. We hypothesize that AKT2 is involved in melanoma invasion and metastasis, and acts as a mediator of the BRAFi response. We further suggest that testing AKT2 isoform-specific targeting in combination with BRAF inhibitors is an anti-melanoma strategy that may avoid serious dose limiting toxicities commonly associated with pan-AKT inhibition.  This work will establish the contribution of AKT2 to BRAF-mutant melanoma progression and metastasis, using both human melanoma cell lines and mouse models. In Aim1, we will investigate the effect of AKT2 knockdown on human melanoma cell migration and invasion, and whether this differs in the presence of the BRAFi Vemurafenib. Further, we will identify AKT2-specific substrates that influence the BRAFi response by immunoprecipitating phosphoproteins reacting with AKT phospho-substrate-specific antibodies in cells treated with Vemurafenib with or without AKT2-specific knockdown. Immunoprecipitates will be analyzed by mass spectrometry, prioritized and validated using AKT2 wild-type and knockdown cells to determine if manipulation of any substrate alters cell sensitivity to BRAF inhibition. In Aim 2, we will investigate the contribution of genetic AKT2 loss in a BRAF-mutant melanoma prone mouse model, and perform metastasis seeding experiments by intra-cardiac injection of AKT2 null cell lines, as well as drug studies in allograft tumors. We will investigate the effect of co-targeting BRAF and AKT2 with specific inhibitors, as a proof-of- principle for future studies. With AKT inhibitors in clinical trials for melanoma, our findings could yield novel therapeutic strategies and increase the efficiency of existing therapies to improve treatment options and outcome for this devastating disease."
"9335420","Project Summary/Abstract The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends a staged approach to the management of pediatric overweight and obesity, starting with Stage 1, Prevention Plus, which encourages families to improve lifestyle choices related to eating and activity in order to improve BMI status. Most pediatric practices have difficulty implementing these guidelines, however, due to limited time and access to weight loss experts to whom they can refer their patients and families, and burden to families in accessing in-person weight loss services. In response, our team developed the FITLINE pediatric practice-based referral program which provides practices an easily accessible resource to help families make AAP-recommended lifestyle changes. The program includes two components: (1) a pediatric practice-based component based on the Let's Go 5-2-1-0 intervention involving systems to assess and document BMI, a healthy habits screener and brief provider- delivered intervention, referral to the FITLINE counseling program, and feedback from the FITLINE nutritionist; and (2) a parent support component consisting of eight weekly FITLINE telephone counseling calls by centrally located nutritionists to provide parents coaching tailored to their family's unique needs and culture to help them set goals and make targeted lifestyle changes recommended by the AAP for Stage 1, Prevention Plus, accompanied by a parent booklet. The proposed five-year cluster randomized controlled pediatric practice-based trial will compare the effectiveness of two practice-based interventions on improving diet and physical activity and reducing BMI among overweight and obese 8-12 year olds seen in pediatric practice: (1) PP-FITLINE, consisting of the pediatric practice-based component plus FITLINE counseling and booklet, or (2) PP-Materials, consisting of the same practice-based component, but only the parent materials mailed over 8 weeks, with no referral to FITLINE counseling. Sixteen pediatric primary care practices will be randomized to either the PP-FITLINE (N=8) or the PP-Mailings (N=8) condition. Five hundred and twelve parents and their children ages 8-12 with a body mass index (BMI) of > 85th percentile (overweight or obese) will be recruited from the practices to achieve N=400 at 12 month follow-up. Assessments will be completed at baseline and 6- and 12-months post-baseline. The specific aims of this study are to determine the effectiveness of the PP-FITLINE program in reducing BMI in overweight and obese children and improving the child's diet and physical activity behaviors; explore possible mechanisms of the effect of the PP-FITLINE program on BMI, diet and physical activity; and estimate the cost-effectiveness of the PP-FITLINE compared with the PP-Mailing program. If found to be effective and cost-effective, the PP-FITLINE program will provide an innovative model which can be scaled up for widespread implementation of Stage 1, Prevention Plus of the AAP expert committee recommendations through pediatric practices nationwide, contributing significantly to the development of new standards for weight management care in pediatric practice."

We have isolated the protein from rat and bovine lungs, have identified the full length cDNA for the human, rat, mouse and bovine enzyme, have generated recombinant protein, and have developed a panel of antibodies that are effective for western blotting, immunoprecipitation and immunocytochemistry. aiPLA2 is Ca++-independent, shows maximal activity at pH 4, and represents a lysosomal-type PLA2. During the present period of grant support, we have shown that aiPLA2: 1) plays a major role in degradation of internalized alveolar DPPC; 2) provides substrate for the reacylation pathway of DPPC synthesis; 3) activity is regulated through protein-protein interactions with SP-A; 4) is localized in lung to lamellar bodies and lysosomes; 5) is activated by phosphorylation; and 6) its expression is developmental^ regulated and hormonally responsive. Specific Aim 1 will study models of under- and over-expression of aiPLA2 (knockout and transgenic mice) in order to evaluate the physiologic role of the enzyme in DPPC degradation and synthesis using isolated cells, the isolated perfused lung, and in vivo studies. Time-related (aging) changes in lung phospholipid content will be determined. Specific Aim 2 will evaluate the structure-function relationships for aiPLA2 activity utilizing"

"9513722","Project Summary  Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has transformed HIV-1 infection, once a fatal illness, to a manageable chronic condition. The latest cART regimen uses several classes of antiviral therapeutics and a typical therapy requires a combination of three or more drugs from at least two classes. Drug resistance, severe side effects and difficulties in treatment compliance have brought challenges to the implementation of cART in clinical settings and indicate the need for additional molecular targets. The first critical step of HIV-1 infection is fusion of viral and target cell membranes mediated by viral envelope glycoprotein (Env). Enfuvirtide is the first and still the only fusion inhibitor approved by FDA, but its limitations have restricted its long-term use. Moreover, the current therapies are not curative since they cannot eliminate latent HIV-1 reservoirs harboring integrated proviruses. Antibody-based therapeutics that can potently inhibit HIV-1 entry and also facilitate killing of Env-expressing cells are promising candidates for reservoir-eliminating strategies. The membrane proximal external region (MPER) of HIV-1 Env is a particularly attractive target for fusion inhibitors because it is one of the most conserved and functionally critical regions of the entire HIV-1 Env. Moreover, we have identified several MPER-directed hit compounds that can specifically inhibit membrane fusion mediated by HIV-1 Env but not SIV Env. Furthermore, the MPER-specific bnAbs exhibit extraordinary breadth in blocking HIV-1 infection and they are excellent candidates for developing therapeutic antibodies. In this project, we hypothesize that the MPER of HIV-1 Env is a promising therapeutic target for developing small-molecule and antibody-based inhibitors of viral membrane fusion. We will bring recent advances from the vaccine side of HIV-1 research into the search for novel therapeutics. We will purse the following specific aims: 1) we will identify small-molecule fusion inhibitors targeting the MPER of HIV-1 Env; 2) we will optimize small-molecule fusion inhibitors targeting the MPER; 3) we will develop antibody-based therapeutics targeting the MPER. When the project is completed, it will not only yield leads for preclinical testing, but should also provide novel reagents for further dissecting molecular mechanisms of HIV-1 entry."
"9517293","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High indoor allergen and pollutant levels have repeatedly been linked to asthma morbidity, especially among urban children, who have among the highest asthma morbidity in the US. However, environmental intervention trials for asthma have typically compared an environmental control strategy (ECS) to no intervention, a design that does not reflect the recommended approach to asthma management, which includes ECSs in conjunction with titration of controller medication. As a result, it remains unknown whether the addition of an ECS to controller medication titration results in improved asthma control, and therefore a reduced controller medication requirement. Another unanswered question is whether the addition of an ECS to controller medication titration results in greater reduction of allergic inflammation than medication titration alone. ECSs may have a greater effect on allergic inflammation than controller medications because ECSs target the most upstream point of the asthma inflammatory pathway by reducing pro-inflammatory environmental exposures, while controller medications target a downstream point of this pathway. Surprisingly, it is also unknown whether the improvement in asthma in ECS trials is mediated by reductions in allergen levels and/or reduction in pollutant levels. Understanding the factors that mediate the effects of an ECS on asthma is important for refuting, or supporting, a causal role for indoor allergens and/or pollutants in asthma morbidity, and also for optimizing the design of ECSs to target the most influential factors. We therefore hypothesize that the addition of an individually-tailored, multi-faceted ECS to guidelines-based controller medication titration will result in less controlle medication requirement and allergic inflammation than controller medication titration alone among urban asthmatic children. We will test this hypothesis and identify the factors that mediate the clinical effects of the ECS with a parallel-arm, randomized controlled trial of ECS plus controller medication titration vs. controller medication titration alone. Our aims are: (1) T determine the effect of the addition of ECS to controller medication titration on controller medication requirements and allergic inflammatory biomarkers, and (2) To determine whether reductions in particulate matter (PM) and/or indoor allergens mediate the effects of an ECS on asthma. This proposed trial will answer a pivotal question because if ECSs do not provide additional benefit in the context of treatment with controller medication, the role of ECS in asthma management should be downgraded. On the other hand, if ECSs do indeed reduce controller medication requirements, greater emphasis should be placed on the importance of ECSs in asthma management, studies should be conducted to identify best ECS practices, and policies should be changed to require third party payers to cover ECS costs."
"9488558","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nonmedical use of psychoactive stimulant medication (medication that is prescribed for the treatment of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder; ADHD) is an increasingly prevalent form of prescription drug misuse among high school students (McCabe & West, 2013) and prevalence rates continue to rise. Stimulant-related emergency department visits increased threefold in recent years (SAMHSA, 2013a). Students with prescriptions are the primary source of stimulant diversion (selling, sharing one's medication). However, with the exception of developmental research we recently launched, clinical strategies for management of stimulant diversion have yet to be developed and empirically evaluated for primary care providers - a professional population that frequently treats ADHD and that is being targeted by NIDA (Volkow, 2012), especially with regard to nonmedical use of prescription drugs including stimulants (Volkow, 2010). Our work with primary care providers revealed 1) concern about the problem, 2) a lack of strategies for addressing it, and 3) willingness to adopt new strategies to decrease diversion potential. This application proposes to test the implementation of brief clinical practice strategies, designed to prevent stimulant diversion that pediatricians may use with their teenage patients receiving stimulant prescriptions and their parents. In response to RFA-DA-15-010, Interventions for youth who misuse/abuse prescription stimulant medications in high school and/or college-attending youth (U01), we will conduct a randomized trial to examine the effect on patient diversion, attitudes, and intentions, of an intervention to be delivered by pediatric providers at the time of stimulant prescribing. N=375 13-17 year old patients will be enrolled across six pediatric practices for assessment prior to, and following, provider training in stimulant diversion practices. Following baseline assessment, providers at half of the practices, randomly selected within matched pairs, will receive training in the Stimulant Diversion Prevention (SDP) protocol; the remainder will implement Treatment as Usual (TAU). Providers and parents will also participate in the assessments and electronic medical record data will be collected for participating patients. We will also characterize prescribing patterns in all participating and non participating practices in the UPMC pediatric provider network independent of study participation (543 pediatricians) for comparison to regional trends. The results of this study will provide the first empirical test of a brief provider-led intervention for stimulant diversion reduction in primary care. The goals are innovative given the complete absence of such strategies in evidence-based ADHD treatment guidelines. The project addresses an immediate public health concern and is based on developmental work (R34 DA035464) that includes stakeholders (providers) as consultants to develop feasible strategies with a high likelihood of delivery. Thus, the impact of the work is expected to be high, with the result being a pragmatic, low cost, and highly disseminable means by which prescription stimulant diversion may be decreased."
"9519214","Project Summary Stress induces an integrated hormonal, autonomic, and behavioral response by activating Corticotropin Releasing Factor (CRF) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN). While CRF is released to the pituitary to initiate Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis activity, we have discovered a new mechanism in which CRF acts in the PVN. A previously uncharacterized population of neurons in the PVN express CRFR1, the primary receptor for CRF, allowing them to respond to locally released peptide. Circuit level analysis suggests that PVN CRFR1 neurons synapse back on CRF neurons to provide local feedback to the HPA axis, and synapse on magnocellular and pre-autonomic neurons to coordinate neuroendocrine and autonomic responses. Our preliminary data indicate that in naïve animals, this local microcircuit functions to inhibit HPA axis activity, consistent with electrophysiological evidence that CRFR1 neurons make inhibitory synapses on neighboring neurons. However, in the context of chronic stress, intra-PVN signaling is required to maintain HPA axis activity, indicating that CRFR1 neurons potentiate CRF neuron activity. This proposal is focused on resolving this paradox by establishing the architecture of a CRF-CRFR1 microcircuit in the PVN, determining the importance of CRFR1 neurons in shaping HPA axis responses and autonomic tone in the context of acute stress responses, and exploring how the microcircuit changes after chronic stress to invert its influence on the HPA axis. In order to address our hypotheses, we use genetically guided expression of optogenetic, chemogenetic, and viral tracing tools to define the anatomical and functional importance of this new population of neurons. Successful completion of the experiments described in this proposal will define a new facet of HPA axis regulation and coordination of PVN output that is essential for the maintenance of appropriate stress responses. This information will fill a gap in our understanding of how neural circuits impinge on the PVN to orchestrate the stress response. Moreover, failure of this mechanism potentially explains how the HPA axis becomes hyperactive in a subset of diseases such as depression, and hypoactive in other diseases like Post- Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), after exposure to intense or chronic stress."

"9284510","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research on plasticity in motor systems has for the most part developed separately from work on sensory plasticity, as if training-induced changes to the brain affected each of these systems in isolation. The planned studies explore the idea that influences of learning are more extensive, and in the sensorimotor system, spread from motor to somatosensory areas of the brain and vice versa. The proposed studies will systematically explore two hypotheses about neuroplasticity: (1) that motor learning changes perceptual function and the function of somatosensory areas of the brain, and (2) that somatosensory training changes both motor function and motor areas of the brain. Our plan is to address the effects of motor learning on sensory systems and of somatosensory perceptual training on motor systems by using a cohesive approach that is similar for both hypotheses and combines psychophysical, neurophysiological and neuroimaging techniques. With respect to the first hypothesis, we will conduct behavioral tests of the idea that motor learning and perceptual change have a similar time course and that after motor learning, movements follow altered perceptual boundaries. We will use fMRI resting-state functional connectivity analyses to test the idea that motor learning is associated with changes to sensory areas of the brain and these changes are linked to behavioral measures of learning and perceptual change. We will test for cortical changes in sensory function by using electroencephalography (EEG) to record somatosensory evoked-potentials (SEPs) and relate changes in SEPs to measures of motor learning. For the second hypothesis, we will conduct behavioral tests of the idea that somatosensory perceptual training improves the rate of motor learning and produces persistent changes in movement that can be measured for periods of up to one week. We will use resting state imaging to test the idea that somatosensory training strengthens functional connectivity bilaterally in motor areas of the brain. We will use trans-cranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to test for changes associated with somatosensory training in the excitability of primary motor cortex. The ability to quantify changes to brain plasticity that accompany both somatosensory training and motor learning may permit a better understanding of the broader effects of neurological rehabilitation on sensorimotor disorders. Imaging the sensory and motor networks of the brain that are associated with both somatosensory and motor learning may also lead to better diagnoses and tracking of brain neuroplasticity during therapy."
"9381491","ABSTRACT While it is undisputed that extracellular matrix and soft tissues influence skeletal growth, few specific pathways explaining this effect have been uncovered. In Marfan syndrome, which affects 1-2 in 5000 individuals, skeletal overgrowth, long digits, poorly developed musculature and lax joints result from fibrillin-1 (FBN1) mutations. Strikingly, specific mutations in FBN1 can also cause the ?opposite? of Marfan syndrome, i.e. short stature, disproportionally short digits (brachydactyly), stiff joints, and a ?pseudomuscular? build, which are the hallmarks of acromelic dysplasias, comprising a group of Mendelian disorders. Identical acromelic dysplasias can also be caused by genes encoding ADAMTS proteases, ADAMTS-like (ADAMTSL) proteins, latent transforming growth factor-? (TGF?) binding protein-3 (LTBP3), and SMAD4. The overlapping phenotypes of different gene mutations underlying acromelic dysplasias strongly support my hypothesis that a fibrillin-ADAMTS-TGF? axis constitutes a novel extracellular matrix (ECM) network regulating postnatal limb growth. Mutations in ADAMTSL2 or FBN1 lead to geleophysic dysplasia (GD), a severe, frequently lethal human acromelic dysplasia. ADAMTSL2 is a secreted glycoprotein that binds to FBN1 and FBN2, and is implicated in TGF? signaling. Intriguingly, ADAMTSL2 mRNA is not expressed in growth plate cartilage or bone, but has its strongest expression in tendon. My studies show that FBN2 microfibrils are increased at sites of Adamtsl2 expression in a mouse knockout model of GD, suggesting a role for ADAMTSL2 in switching from prenatal FBN2-dominated microfibrils to postnatal FBN1-dominated microfibrils. Furthermore, skeletal growth is impaired upon limb-specific ADAMTSL2 deletion (Prx1-Cre) or tendon and ligament specific deletion (Scx- Cre). I observed disproportionate distal limb shortening (i.e. acromelic dysplasia) and a reduction in Achilles tendon length in both conditional deletions. A model for skeletal growth in geleophysic dysplasia provides an opportunity to determine how tissue non-autonomous regulation of skeletal growth occurs via mechanical or regulatory input from tendon ECM. In aim 1, I will test the hypothesis by analyzing postnatal limb growth and ECM alterations in the microfibril system after Adamtsl2 deletion in tendons with Scx-Cre. In aim 2, I will investigate how ADAMTSL2 interacts with FBN1 and FBN2 and how ADAMTSL2 executes its role in the isoform switch from FBN2 to FBN1. I will analyze the genetic interaction of Adamtsl2 with Fbn1 and Fbn2 in mice and I will use protein-protein interaction studies and cell culture assays to gain mechanistic insights in the function of ADAMTSL2 in regulating the fibrillin isoform switch. Impact: The anticipated results will provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of acromelic dysplasias and other fibrillinopathies. These insights could be translated for targeting tendon ECM in regenerative strategies. The proposal addresses fundamental questions of how functional properties of soft tissues are determined by ECM subsequently might regulate postnatal limb growth."

Yet, NIH prefers that infrastructure type services such as NITRC Research Services become self-sustaining so that the cost burden is carried by those who use and benefit from the service itself. Our Phase 1 SBIR proposal successfully implemented a proof of concept of the proposed enhanced service NITRC Image Repository (NITRC-IR), as well as a proof of concept for an additional enhanced service, the NITRC Computational Environment (NITRCCE). The objective of this Phase 2 SBIR proposal is to create a more polished and easy-to-use set of commercially viable services that allow and encourage a significantly wider audience of researchers to share datasets, computational resources, and research results with the neuroscience community. Specifically, we propose: 1) Productization and Enhanced Services for Computation (NITRC-CE): Increase the functionality of NITRCCE through the introduction of a mobile platform, the ability for researchers to create interactive replicable demonstrations, and the ability to drag-and-drop data sets to improve the ease of conducting analyses. 2) Productization and Enhanced Services for Data and Resource Storage (NITRC-R and NITRC-IR): Introduce portlets (which allow integration of NITRC news and download functionality with external sites), support for publisher integration, expansion of public datasets, support for private datasets, and the creation of permanent identifiers for tools and resources, to facilitate reproducibility of published analyses. 3) Usability Research and Testing: Conduct usability research and update user stories for NITRC Research Services based on feedback, update prototype functionality based on feedback, facilitate heuristic evaluation of the functionality to ensure it meets the requirements as established by the updated user stories, conduct pre- and post-implementation surveys to verify willingness to pay based on proposed cost models to ensure commercial viability."
"8107006","Numerous population and animal studies have established the atheroprotective properties of high density  lipoproteins (HDL). In addition to its main antiatherogenic property of extracting cholesterol from peripheral  cells and transferring it to the liver for excretion (reverse cholesterol transport, RCT), HDL also possesses  anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. An emerging area in the field of HDL therapy is the  development of apolipoprotein mimetic peptides. We have shown that orally administered apoA-l-mimetic  peptides result in a dramatic reduction in the atherosclerotic lesion formation in atherosclerosis-sensitive  mouse models despite no change in cholesterol levels. We hypothesize that this occurs via the formation of  prep-HDL-like particles that possess increased paroxonase-1 (PON1) activity which are able to destroy lipid  hydroperoxides (LOOH) and enhance reverse cholesterol transport, the major antiatherogenic properties of  apoA-l. Thus antiatherogenic peptides modulate the properties of HDL such that proatherogenic HDL is  converted into antiatherogenic HDL. We propose two mechanisms for the formation of both antiatherogenic  a and preJBHDL in the presence of antiatherogenic peptides: 1) enhanced interaction with ABCA1 to form  increased levels of apo A-l-only containing particle with increased amounts of PON1 levels of pre(3-HDL  particles; and 2) enhanced receptor (SRB-1) interaction of a-HDL particles to clear cholesteryl ester, thus  regenerating active pre(3-HDL particles. We hypothesize that the antiatherogenic properties are governed by  the ability of the peptide (peptide-lipid complexes) to recruit apoA-l, LOOH, and enzymes such as PON1  present in HDL. If, for example, PON1 is not active on these particles, this HDL is inflammatory since it  possesses LOOH. To test our hypothesis we propose the following specific aims: 1a. Influence of peptide  structure on the composition of HDL. 1b. Structural aspects of peptide association; 2a. Antiatherogenic  potential of each peptide. 2b. Testing of selected peptides for their antiatherogenic properties in  atherosclerosis sensitive mouse models. We will use physical, physico-chemical, in vitro cell culture and in  vivo studies in animal models of atherosclerosis to characterize the structure and function of peptidemediated  HDL changes that are related to antiatherogenic properties. These studies will for the first time  enable us to understand the detailed structural aspects of peptide-modulated antiatherogenic HDL and the  mechanism of antiatherogenic and anti-inflammatory actions of apoA-l-mimetic peptides. Furthermore, these  studies will lead to the design of simple molecules with increased antiatherogenic and anti-inflammatory  potencies and potentially lead to novel modalities to ameliorate atherosclerosis."

"9517603","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application responds to RFA-AA-12-007 creating a Consortium for translational research on alcoholic hepatitis (AH), which we have named TREAT: Translational Research and Evolving Alcoholic hepatitis Treatment. AH is a relatively uncommon complication of heavy alcohol use, but carries a high early mortality rate and is a very strong predictor of the development of cirrhosis if the patient continues heavy alcohol use. Current therapies for severe AH are unsatisfactory, and therefore better, mechanistically-based therapies are needed. The long term goal of this consortium of Indiana University (TREAT-IU), Mayo Clinic (TREAT- Mayo), and Virginia Commonwealth University (TREAT-VCU) is to develop therapies for AH that prevent early mortality and reduce the rate of progression to cirrhosis. Because of the lack of satisfactory animal models, we have chosen to focus on human biology. The central hypothesis is that AH results from: a) impaired gut integrity and portal endotoxinemia, b) activation the innate immune system, c) sensitization of hepatocytes to apoptotic cytokines through oxidative stress and abnormal bile salt metabolism, and d) necroapoptosis of the hepatocytes. We propose that these pathways can be blocked with oral administration of antibody to LPS, activation of the FXR signaling pathways, and inhibition of caspases, and that this will improve outcomes. The objective of this application is: 1) to create a registry of patients with AH and control heavy drinkers without liver injury, which will supply patients and patient samples for the mechanistic studies, pilot projects, and clinical trials, allowing us to test hypotheses about pathogenesis, risk factors, prognostic indicators, and response to therapy of AH; 2) to study interrelated pathophysiological mechanisms of liver injury; and 3) to test the ability of drugs reversing these abnormalities to improve outcomes in AH."

"9330898","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Center for Genomically Engineered Organs (CGEO) will combine cutting edge genomics, genome editing technology, and tissue engineering methods to develop improved models of complex tissues. These tissues will be producible in laboratories from reprogrammed or genetically modified stem or other cells, will contain multiple cell types and vasculatures, and will be designed and rigorously compared against natural (healthy or diseased) tissues so that they match closely at both a molecular level and in overall tissue architecture. These model tissues have potential to greatly expedite biomedical progress by providing researchers a way to conduct preliminary tests of theories about normal and disease biology quickly and inexpensively in their laboratories before they have to move on to costly and potentially invasive experiments on animals or humans. CGEOs research is divided into three Aims. In Aim 1, CGEO will develop methods to comprehensively analyze tissues in situ at a molecular level, by acquiring high-throughput RNA expression, protein expression, and epigenomic data together in each of the tissue's individual cells, along with the locations of these molecules in these cells. In Aim 2, CGEO will develop and apply innovative computational algorithms that compare the cells in the model tissues against their corresponding natural counterparts and assess systematically not only how closely their corresponding cell type molecular profiles match, but also compare their overall cell architectures and relationships. These algorithms will also specify how genome editing and engineering can be used to improve the matching between the engineered cells in the model tissue and the natural cells of the native tissue. CGEO will apply these technologies to build model tissues important to neurobiology and hematopoiesis, and, finally, in Aim 3, also apply them to in vitro cultured embryos and germ line tissues in mice, which has potential to reveal pathways that will enable models of all tissues to be generated in a laboratory. CGEO is a collaboration of six laboratories in the Boston area with combined expertise in advanced genomic and proteomic technology, genome engineering, developmental systems, stem cell technology, epigenetics, super-resolution microscopy, and tissue engineering. The CGEO team comprises Professors George Church (Principal Investigator), David Sinclair, and Chao-Ting Wu (all from Harvard Medical School), Ed Boyden (MIT), George Daley (Children's Hospital), and Jennifer Lewis (Wyss Institute at Harvard)."
"9288293","Project Summary  Although largely asymptomatic, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) can cause severe and even fatal disease in a subset of susceptible individuals. While great progress has been made in understanding essential stages of HCMV replication, a detailed description of many of these processes is lacking. Of particular interest in this proposal is cytoplasmic envelopment. To provide a molecular description of the events associated with cytoplasmic envelopment, it is important to identify the factors involved, both viral and cellular. Previous work has identified UL71 as an envelopment factor that potentially mediates membrane scission, as viruses lacking UL71 are trapped at various stages of budding. It is not known whether UL71 is sufficient itself for promoting scission or if it requires other viral and/or cellular factors. Many viruses utilize cellular machinery known as the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRTs) as part of the envelopment process. While HCMV does not require the early ESCRT-I complex, it does require the late ESCRT Vps4. The role of the ESCRT-III complex, which is the major driver of membrane deformation and scission promoter, has not yet been investigated. Understanding the role, if any, for ESCRT-III during infection is essential for providing a detailed description of cytoplasmic envelopment. We hypothesize that UL71 recruits ESCRT-III and Vps4 to mediate scission of budding HCMV capsids. In support of this hypothesis, an interaction between UL71 and Vps4 has been reported. The experiments in this proposal will investigate if ESCRT-III subunits are required for HCMV replication, and if so at what stage. They will investigate the relationship, if any, between UL71 and ESCRT-III and define a function for the UL71-Vps4 interaction, as well as identify regions on UL71 important for function. These studies will further our understanding of the contribution of cellular factors to HCMV infection and potentially identify novel ways in which viral replication can be targeted. Taken together, these studies will lay the foundation for a mechanistic understanding of HCMV cytoplasmic envelopment."

The state directly inspects over 50% of food establishments or approximately 11,000 and the 19 local governments inspect 11,000. The Department currently employs 17 individuals that routinely complete retail food inspections. The local health agencies employ over 50 additional inspectors who complete retail food inspections.  Overall, the completion of the projects described in this proposal and related documents will allow the Department to move toward full conformance and enhance conformance with the retail program standards. The development of the reports/exports related to compliance and enforcement and routine regular review of progress of each inspector will assist in ensuring continued conformance with Standard 6 and further ensure appropriate attention is being focused by inspectional and leadership staff to ensure the reduction of risk factor violations. The development and use of the chain or owner baseline survey (trending) will assist in educating and showing operators where systematic improvements can be made to assist in reduce risk factor violations. We anticipate this owner or chain approach could have a significant impact in reducing risk factor violations and improving practice in multiple establishments.  Using the baseline survey to help guide the development and revision of documents will assist in reducing risk factor violations. Routinely reviewing and updating documents will ensure the most current and effective information is provided. Translating the documents into appropriate languages and enhancing the documents using most illustrations and graphics will also assist in communicating concepts related to risk factor violations to operators. Further, using social media and other techniques will enhance and provide a more effective means of communicating and often instantaneous.  Lastly, the joint inspection program will improve inspectional quality and allow mentoring and shadowing desired behaviors to improve the overall quality of inspections. We believe this project improves the quality and uniformity of inspections and will also lead to a reduction of risk factor violations.  Together, these programs seek to enhance and ensure the Department's conformance with Standards 2, 4, 6, 7, and 9."

This network will offer a broad range of consultative services intended to enrich the research capacity of the medical rehabilitation research community across three core areas: Cellular Therapeutics/Tissue Engineering, Mechanotransductive Methods, and Rehabilitation & Mechanosensitive Biomarkers (Specific Aim 2a). Collaborative projects between external investigators and AR3T faculty members will be incentivized through an aggressive national marketing campaign to highlight services offered by AR3T Cores. To further encourage utilization of our Core resources, we will offer services gratis to external investigators, while compensating non- key personnel for time spent consulting with external investigators. AR3T Cores model the highly successful template of the University of Pittsburgh Clinical and Translational Science Institute, which boasts a long track record of offering similar services to a broad research community.  To encourage external investigators with interest in pursuing Regenerative Rehabilitation research to participate in hands-on experiences and training, we have designed the AR3T Scholars Program (Specific Aim 2b). This program will provide investigators with the opportunity for short-term visits and sabbatical experiences at one of the AR3T laboratories, ranging from one week to three months. In an attempt to minimize potential barriers to participation in this program, AR3T will provide Scholars with stipend support to offset housing costs during their stay at the host institution. In addition, the host institutions will receive compensation for personnel time and research supplies utilized by the visiting Scholar. We anticipate that successful completion of the proposed aims will catalyze novel and promising lines of collaborative investigations (as evidenced by manuscripts and grant submissions) and the expansion of a generation of scientists committed to pursing Regenerative Rehabilitation research careers."

The purpose of the NIDA P30 Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome is to empower and train researchers supported by NIH, NIDA, NIAAA, and other federal and state institutions to use more quantitative and testable ways to analyze genetic, epigenetic, and the environmental factors that influence drug abuse risk and treatment. The Administrative Core manages relations among research cores, groups of users, trainees, and pilot program participants. The Transcriptome Informatics and Mechanisms research core assembles and analyzes hundreds of large genome (DNA) and transcriptome (RNA) datasets for experimental rodent (rat) models of addiction. The Systems Analytics and Modeling research core, is using innovative systems genetics methods (gene mapping) to understand the linkage between DNA differences, environmental risks such as stress, and the differential risk of drug abuse and relapse. The Pilot core is catalyzing new collaborations among young investigator in the field of addiction research. In sum the Center is a national resource for more reproducible research in addiction. We are centralizing, archiving, distributing, analyzing and integrating high quality data, metadata, using open software systems in collaboration with many other teams of researchers. Our goal is to help build toward an NIDA Addictome Portal that will include all genomic research relevant to addiction research."
"9308924","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a long-documented and continuing shortage of well-trained MD and PhD investigators in Gastroenterology & Hepatology. This issue was further highlighted as an urgent national need in the NIH authorized National Commission on Digestive Diseases Report (March 2009). The overall goal of this program is to provide a diverse group of post-doctoral trainees with an exceptional supervised training and mentoring experience in order to allow them to develop or enhance their research skills and knowledge in preparation for a successful gastroenterology- and hepatology-related research career. This program is intended for post- doctoral MD or PhD trainees and will provide support for 2 or 3 years (currently 2 fellows per year). Success in academic medicine requires not only developing one's own research program but also developing collaborations. Collaborations stimulate ideas, facilitate translational application and provide stimulus for program projects. We have identified research areas involving multiple investigators. Fellows interested in these topics are asked to meet with mentors from these topics. In turn, we encourage collaborative interactions between the various investigative groups that have common research themes. The salient point is that there are many exceptional opportunities for education of trainees in pivotal areas of gastrointestinal/hepatic research, and there is direct access to investigators with complementary skills potentially beyond the realm of the primary mentor; clearly, some of the accomplished faculty members fall into more than one theme category. The faculty of the T32 can be grouped into main 6 research groups: Mucosal Inflammation Program; Immunology of the Liver; Nutrition, Metabolic Syndrome, and Gut Microbiota; Gastroenterology and Hepatology Health Outcomes Policy and Economics Center; Gastrointestinal and Hepatic Cell and Molecular Biology; Carcinogenesis. In addition to the in-person evaluations of the trainee by the mentor and mentorship committee, the Research and Career Development Committee meets quarterly to review all of the trainees based on their personal interaction and the evaluations provided by the mentor and mentorship committees. As mentioned, this Committee not only evaluates the progress of the Trainees, but also of the program in general. The group discusses both how the trainee is doing in terms of their research project, their interaction with their primary mentor, their productivity in writing, their ability to write grants, their short-term and long-term goals,and whether they are on-track to becoming an independent investigator."
"9263052","  The University of Pittsburgh proposes a five-year renewal of its Biomedical Informatics (BMI) Training Program. The T15 grant is currently entering its 30th consecutive year. Our program is notable for the long and distinguished history of biomedical informatics research in Pittsburgh, the continuous evolution and refinement of our educational programs, the strong institutional commitment to biomedical informatics and our training program, and the rich biomedical and computational research environment in which our training program is set. The program has an administrative home in the Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI) within the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.

The program is supported by an interdepartmental core faculty of 36 faculty members, including all 17 faculty members with primary appointments in DBMI. The Training Program Director, a tightly knit leadership group of faculty co-directors, and two experienced staff members support the overall operation of the program.  The Pittsburgh BMI Training Program offers research training in all four sub-disciplines of Biomedical Informatics: healthcare/clinical informatics, translational bioinformatics, clinical research informatics, and public health informatics. Additionally, with this competitive renewal, we are proposing a new program in environmental exposures informatics. Trainees in our T15-funded training programs may pursue an MS or PhD in Biomedical Informatics, an MS or PhD in Intelligent Systems ? Biomedical Informatics Track, an MD/PhD through the Medical Scientist Training Program, or advanced postdoctoral research.  The training program has undergone significant enhancements during the past funding period including a move to new contiguous space, a new admissions and recruitment process, new courses, and additional new efforts to recruit trainee candidates, including candidates from under-represented minorities and disadvantaged backgrounds. Enhancements for the proposed funding period include new courses, new professional development opportunities, and enhanced training in research reproducibility. A major focus will be to expand on our already well developed research programs in data science to enhance the training of T15 funded trainees.  We have a strong track record of success in training biomedical informatics researchers in all sub- disciplines. Trainees from our program are publishing research articles in high impact journals in the field, winning national awards for their research, writing successful K grants and individual fellowship awards, and securing research positions in academics, industry and government upon graduation."
"9312292","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have been extremely powerful and successful identifying associations between genetic polymorphisms (SNP) and diabetic and chronic kidney disease (CKD) development. Our next big challenge is to translate this information to understand the mechanism of diabetic and CKD development. The major hurdle is that the majority of CKD associated polymorphisms lie outside the coding region of the genome. Therefore classic protein biochemistry and gene deletion studies of model organisms cannot yet be applied. Several recent pioneering studies have provided a novel framework for such experiments and indicate that the cell type specific epigenome can be used to understand and annotate the non-coding region of the genome. As there are hundreds of established SNPs for CKD, performing individual experiments for each SNP could be a daunting task, therefore there is a critical need for genome wide cell type specific mapping of non-coding regulatory regions and defining the correlation between SNP's and transcript levels. The proposal will use a combination of methods to dissect the association between diabetic and chronic kidney disease associated polymorphisms and disease."

"9332352","PROJECT SUMMARY The exceedingly high rate of smoking and its substantial contribution to morbidity and mortality in the HIV- infected population despite effective ART makes smoking a major health risk in the HIV-infected population. The mechanism by which smoking exerts synergistic effects on HIV-induced immune dysfunction remains unclear. Our central hypothesis is that the persistent HIV-induced immune dysfunction leaves the lung exceeding vulnerable to further insults by smoking. Smoking further drives immune-mediate pathways, such as increase in oxidative stress and inflammation, to cause further local tissue destruction. The lung pathology can result in activation of latently infected alveolar macrophages in the lung to produce low level HIV viremia, and perpetuates this pro-inflammatory environment. Additionally, the chronic oxidative imbalance can cause not only local tissue damage but cellular DNA damage, which results in epithelial gene expression alterations. Aim 1 seeks to identify in a cross-sectional study of ART-treated HIV smokers chronic immune effects of smoking by evaluating for differences in cytokine profile and immune cell phenotype and ROS production of cells isolated in the airways and blood from HIV-infected never smokers. The relationships of these local and systemic immune perturbations with airway epithelial gene transcriptome and evidence of residual viremia will be evaluated to identify biological pathways by which smoking interacts with HIV immune dysfunction. In Aim 2 to further test the hypothesis we propose a proof-of-concept smoking cessation clinical study to assess the degree and nature of reversibility of lung damage among HIV smokers who achieve smoking cessation compared to those who continue to smoke. In this single site study, we will employ an intensive smoking cessation program to help study participants who are recruited from a large urban HIV-infected outpatient clinic where a unique integrated clinical research infrastructure is in place, achieve smoking cessation. Longitudinally samples will be collected pre-cessation and post-cessation from those who are able to achieve 10-week cessation from the lung and blood. We will evaluate the change in level of inflammation, immune activation and oxidative stress, and determine if these immune-mediate pathways are related to changes in HIV residual viremia and epithelial gene expression in the lung. Lastly, leveraging existing resources, we will compare these finding to those in uninfected smokers from banked samples collected already by our collaborator. This smoking cessation study in HIV-infected patients will be the first of its kind, with longitudinal specimen collection from both the lung and blood compartments, and utilizing translational approaches through collaborations with experts in virology, immunology, gene transcription and health disparity research. Understanding the relative contribution and pathways by which smoking interacts with immune activation and inflammation characteristic of chronic HIV disease will help guide development of therapeutic interventions to halt or reverse these pathological processes and ensuing clinical disease."
"8114840","Cardiac hypertrophy is the result of complex genetically predetermined electrical and mechanical remodeling  programs in response to mechanical and neurohumoral stimuli. Ca plays a pivotal role in the activation and  regulation of several hypertrophy transcription pathways, while Ca signaling itself undergoes profound  changes in hypertrophy (Hyp) and heart failure (HF), including significant contributions from InsP3-dependent  Ca release.  The specific aims of the proposed study are:  1) characterize the role of InsP3-dependent Ca signaling for excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) in  atrial and ventricular myocytes under physiological conditions and in Hyp/HF.  2) test the hypothesis that InsP3-dependent Ca release facilitates arrhythmogenic Ca signals (SR Ca  overload, Ca waves, Ca alternans, enhanced Ca spark frequency) and changes of membrane potential  (early (EAD) and delayed (DAD) afterdepolarizations, spontaneous action potentials (APs) and  electrical alternans) in Hyp/HF ventricular myocytes.  3) identify the cellular and subcellular Ca signaling pathways and spatio-temporal [Ca], patterns  relevant for nuclear Ca/calmodulin/calcineurin-dependent NFAT translocation which initiate gene  transcription and gene expression in cardiac Hyp and HF.  To achieve these aims a multitude of experimental techniques will be used: high resolution Ca imaging by  laser scanning confocal microscopy in single cardiac myocytes, novel FRET(CFP/YFP) fluorescent InsP3  sensors to study the cellular and subcellular dynamics of InsP3, whole-cell voltage clamp techniques to study  membrane currents and membrane potential changes, and molecular biological and pharmacological tools to  manipulate the InsP3/Ca/calmodulin/clacineurin/NFAT signaling cascade. Furthermore, several animal/cell  models will be used including wild-type mouse and rabbit, hypertrophy mouse, InsPa receptor knockout  mouse and heart failure rabbit.  The proposed research will generate fundamental new information on the roles of InsP3R-dependent Ca  signaling in cardiac myocytes during ECC, in arrhythmogenesis, electrophysiological changes and nuclear  transcription signaling in normal, Hyp and HF cardiac myocytes."

"9408319","Abstract Nearly 90% of patients who suffer an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (CA) die. This leading cause of unexpected and sudden death in the US results in an enormous emotional, psychological and financial burden to hundreds of thousands of families and communities across America annually. Relative to the many potentially lethal disease states such as cancer, stroke, sepsis, and trauma, CA survival rates have barely improved since 1960 when manual standard (S) was first described. Over the past 25 years, the applicants have discovered and developed new approaches, techniques and devices to increase cerebral and coronary blood flow and improve neurologically-sound survival after CA. With prior NIH SBIR support they developed the impedance threshold device (ITD), performed animal and clinical trials, and ultimately obtained FDA approval for manual active compression decompression (ACD) plus ITD, the first device ever approved by the FDA to increase the likelihood of survival after CA. Despite this progress, further innovation is needed to substantively improve successful outcomes for more Americans. This application is focused on a new discovery that elevation of the head and thorax during ACD + ITD CPR results in a striking decrease in intracranial pressures and an increase in cerebral and coronary perfusion pressures. These findings, due to the effects of gravity when the head and heart are elevated, have the potential to significantly further enhance cerebral and coronary blood flow and improve overall survivability. The proposed research in an animal model of cardiac arrest is focused on demonstrating proof-of-concept that a new head up CPR device, when used in combination with ACD + ITD CPR, is able to significantly improve blood flow to the heart and brain safely and effectively increase 48-hour survival in an animal model of prolonged CA. We further propose to assess the ergonomics and human factors associated with a light-weight human prototypic head up CPR device in manikins and human cadavers with help of professional firefighters. This novel and approach could increase neurologically-favorable survival rates for >10,000 more Americans annually due to greater blood flow and lower intracranial pressure afforded by gravity-enhanced head up CPR."
"9315724","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Understanding the mechanisms which drive immune responses to autoantigens is of high priority. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), protein citrullination is a major target of the immune system. Significant data implicates the anti-citrullinated protein immune response in RA pathogenesis, with recent evidence suggesting that mechanisms which enhance citrullination are associated with the worst disease outcome. While different mechanisms likely promote citrullination in RA, our published and preliminary data suggest that citrullination and the complement system are interacting pathways that amplify each other to enhance autoantigen production and immune-mediated damage in a sizable subset of RA patients. Thus, we have found that cellular membranolysis mediated by complement is a potent inducer of protein citrullination in the RA joint, and that this process is associated with citrullination of critical regulatory components of the complement system (complement factor H (CFH), and C3), enhancing complement activation. The previous finding that anti-CFH antibodies are prevalent in RA further highlights the importance of CFH in this disease, adding an extra mechanism that may dysregulate complement in RA. Taken together, we propose that citrullination-induced complement dysregulation and anti-CFH antibodies are key amplifiers that propagate damage and citrullination activity in the RA joint. We will examine this hypothesis in 3 Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will use mass spectrometry and biochemical assays to define the structural and functional effects of citrullination on CFH and C3, as well as the effect of these modified proteins on the induction of the terminal complement complex, neutrophil hypercitrullination and B cell activation mediated by citrullinated C3dg. Aim 2 will use multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) to quantify citrullinated CFH and C3 in synovial fluid from RA and other arthritides to define their association with complement deposition and lytic activity in the joint. Aim 3 will determine whether anti-CFH antibodies participate in the dysregulation of complement in RA by defining their prevalence and clinical significance in RA, their association with complement activation, and their effect on CFH function. These studies will define novel interacting mechanisms of disease amplification relevant to sustain inflammation and aggravate damage in the rheumatoid joint. Furthermore, the studies will show that these pathways are active in vivo in RA, identifying markers and subgroups for precise therapeutic intervention."

"9381277","Project Summary/Abstract Hypertension is the major risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases worldwide. The escalating prevalence of inadequate sleep now parallels that of hypertension. Observational and experimental evidence favoring a causal relation between insufficient sleep and hypertension are particularly compelling - sleeping 6 hours or less per night is associated with a 20-32% higher probability of incident hypertension. Since sleep curtailment is largely voluntary, sleep deficiency may be corrected and the detrimental health consequences potentially reversed. Nevertheless, systematic studies and robust evidence of health-promoting effects of sleep enhancement are lacking, and there are no data regarding the underlying mechanisms that may be involved, especially with regard to blood pressure (BP) control. We seek to overcome these limitations by conducting a randomized controlled study to investigate the effects of 8 weeks of sleep enhancement/extension in prehypertensive and stage 1 hypertensive subjects who report habitual short sleep (<6.5 hours/night). Antihypertensive effects of sleep enhancement achieved through education and behavioral intervention will be compared to a placebo/attention control condition receiving health education. Comprehensive measures, including cardiovascular, metabolic and neuroendocrine markers, complemented by molecular phenotyping and psychological characterization, will generate insights into the mechanisms and mediators linking enhanced sleep to any BP reduction, and to any overall improved cardiovascular risk profile. We propose the following Specific Aims comparing sleep enhancement/extension to placebo/attention control: Aim 1. To determine the impact of sleep enhancement on 24-hour BP. Aim 2. To evaluate effects of sleep enhancement on neural circulatory control and vascular function. Aim 3. To assess changes in systemic and local renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) regulation in response to sleep enhancement. Aim 4. To identify metabolic and neuroendocrine mediators of the effects of sleep enhancement on BP. This proposal builds upon important strengths, including an interdisciplinary team of investigators with unique experience and expertise in each of the domains investigated, exciting preliminary data, and the minimization of potential confounders. The integration of physiological and molecular variables in a translational framework, complemented by psychological and behavioral characterization, will further bolster the proposed study. Data from these studies will be pivotal in the development and implementation of effective, low cost, health promoting sleep extension strategies applicable both on a targeted and a population-wide basis."

Our students have written dissertations on topics related to many of AHRQ's strategic research goals, including quality and patient safety, health information technology, prevention and care management, disparities, and evaluating organizational and payment interventions. The PhD program is a collaboration among six Harvard faculties and is administered by a 52-member faculty committee that is appointed by the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences; the Committee is chaired by Joseph Newhouse, the Program Director for this grant. The participating faculty members for the purposes of this grant, however, are the 13 members of the Executive Committee, a subset of the 52- member Committee. We have had our current training grant since 1994 and over that time have had 85 students as AHRQ trainees. We have attracted a high quality admissions pool and have many more qualified persons who could be trainees; we have always filled our training grant slots. Our trainees have taken jobs in academia, research institutions, and government and generally have had multiple job offers. Several have won awards for their predoctoral research and also for the research and teaching after their degree; in the past ten years, five students from our program have received the Academy Health Outstanding Dissertation award (in 2003, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2011). Because of intensive monitoring and advising, most of our students finish their degree in six years or less. Of the 222 students who have ever begun the PhD program, 150 have graduated and 61 are currently enrolled. Our philosophy is that the students will work as part of an interdisciplinary research team and therefore need a discipline that they bring to the team as well as an understanding of the disciplines of other team members or potential readers of their work. To implement this philosophy the students choose one of seven disciplines in which they take about half of their course work; additionally they take some course work in three other disciplines. We have a faculty member in charge of minority recruiting and have for the past several years consistently attracted qualified minority students."
"9326654","Project Summary / Abstract Sleep disruption is tightly associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and recent studies suggest it can be causal. While somnopathic paths to AD remain poorly understood, the variety of such disorders associated with chronic sleep loss suggest that these mechanisms are general. This proposal aims to leverage a Drosophila model of presenilin (psn) hypofunction, the leading cause of familial Alzheimer's disease in humans, to investigate these mechanisms. Psn+/- flies have sleep-dependent memory and synaptic defects reminiscent of AD, and a whole- fly metabolomic screen we conducted identified a possible mechanism for these phenotypes: urea cycle hyper- activity, present in both psn+/- and sleep-deprived wild-type flies. I hypothesize that urea cycle disruption couples sleep loss to Alzheimer's disease, perhaps via regulation of autophagy. Aim 1 will test whether urea cycle dysfunction links sleep disturbance to dementia-like psn+/- memory phenotypes, by examining how additional sleep manipulation modulate urea cycle throughput and testing the effects of urea cycle blockade and sleep deprivation on psn+/- memory defects. Aim 2 will test whether sleep disturbance and urea cycle dysfunction are the causes of reduced autophagy in psn+/- flies, by testing the effects of urea cycle blockade, enforced sleep, and sleep deprivation on deposition of insoluble ubiquitinated protein aggregates and live- imaged autophagy flux. Aim 2 will also test whether sleep deprivation is sufficient to disrupt autophagy in wild-type flies, and whether sleep deprivation in psn+/- flies can induce neuronal apoptosis as measured by TUNEL. Finally, Aim 3 will screen the brain metabolomes of psn+/- and sleep-deprived wild-type flies by mass spectroscopy for metabolic pathways our whole-fly screen may have missed, as well as determining whether urea cycle dysregulation by sleep disturbance occurs locally in the psn+/- brain. Through the innovative research strategy described in this proposal, Dr. Joseph Bedont will be trained in a new organism, to study fields in which he has room for growth, using several new techniques including mass spectroscopy. The proposed site, the University of Pennsylvania, provides all of the technical and intellectual resources necessary for success. The proposed sponsor, Dr. Amita Sehgal, is a world expert in Drosophila behavioral genetics and sleep, and a very successful mentor who will provide excellent scientific and career development support to the applicant. And the proposed training plan, especially activities planned with the sponsor and her long-standing collaborator Dr. Aalim Weljie, will provide all of the skills the applicant requires to fully leverage the training potential of the proposal. This proposal will give insight into whether urea cycle and autophagy dysregulation by sleep disturbance is an important contributor to somnopathic neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease, and identify possible additional paths to somnopathy for investigation in future studies."
"9314608","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this collaborative Georgia Health Sciences University/Wayne State University renewal submission is to improve the reproductive health of men and women, thereby fostering the birth of healthy, desired children. To achieve this goal the applicants propose to continue to contribute a broad spectrum of research expertise and resources to the Reproductive Medicine Network (RMN). These include a commitment to and track record in cooperative clinical research - e.g., three protocols approved by the RMN Steering and Advisory Committees over the past five years, as well as a superior record of subject enrollment. The two institutions collectively offer an especially large patient base (including an extraordinarily high percentage of minorities) from which to enroll subjects into new and ongoing Network protocols. The concept protocol for the proposed period of support stems from recent secondary analysis of data from the RMN's Pregnancy in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome study, in which the applicants identified a novel outcome: the standard clinical practice of inducing a progestin-withdrawal bleed prior to administration of fertility medications dramatically decreased conception and live birth rates, compared to anovulatory women not treated with progestins. In view of this clear-cut observation, an innovative study has been designed to capitalize on it. The central hypothesis is that progestin administration to induce a withdrawal bleed will have a detrimental effect on live birth outcome in WHO Category II women with a prior anovulatory cycle. To test this hypothesis, we will pursue three specific aims: 1) Determine the rate of live births among such women receiving clomiphene citrate (CC), with or without preceding progestin withdrawal; 2) Concomitantly determine the time to pregnancy in such women; and 3) Determine the influence of progestin withdrawal on the luteal phase hormonal milieu and the endometrium. The expected outcome is that renewal of our membership in the Network would allow continued contribution to the group's cooperative projects, as well as innovation of new research projects for consideration by the group. Coupled with our enlarged joint rural and urban population, documentation of being a major recruiter of racially diverse patients in RMN trials, stellar history of protocol compliance, strong history of oral and written dissemination of RMN results, and personalized attention to mentorship and training of junior clinical investigators, these are expected to have significant positive impact o the Network's capacity to attain its goal of identifying and/or improving diagnostic and therapeutic solutions to problems in reproductive medicine."
"9207537","DIVISION OF PRIMATE RESOURCES: BREEDING COLONY MANAGEMENT SERVICES SUMMARY The Washington National Primate Research Center (WaNPRC) houses the largest domestic breeding colony of pigtailed macaques (M. nemestrina). This breeding colony serves as a national resource to investigators who use M. nemestrina as an animal model for human disease. The Breeding Colony Management Service (BCMS) functions to optimize quality and availability of this resource. Intentional breeding strategies are used to increase production and reduce loss to increase the availability of animals. One consideration with regard to quality is the elimination of infectious organisms that could impact animal welfare or interfere with research. Current organisms of concern are simian retrovirus (SRV) and Coccidioides immitis, the causative organism of Valley Fever, and sophisticated efforts are underway to eliminate these organisms from the breeding colony. Another consideration for quality is maintenance of on outbred colony. An extensive pedigree and state-of-the- art breeding management software are used to ensure genetic diversity. Additionally, cutting edge genetic tools are used to genetically characterize the animals in the WaNPRC M. nemestrina breeding colony and investigate the association of MHC haplotype with disease susceptibility."
"9530755","PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal is for a 5-year competing renewal of the University of Washington (UW) Superfund Research Program (SRP). The overarching theme of the program is to investigate the mechanisms and ramifications of metal neurotoxicity in humans and aquatic species. Based upon our work, we are developing biomarkers predictive of; 1) exposure to neurotoxic agents, 2) early indicators of neurotoxic injury at the cellular and organismal levels, and/or 3) genetic determinants that underlie unusual susceptibility to environmental neurotoxicants. The physiological processes under investigation adversely affect cognition, olfaction and neurobehavioral processes, and are associated with the risk of developing Alzheimer's and non-Alzheimer's related dementia, Parkinson's disease, and other neurodevelopmental diseases. Our research focuses upon metals that commonly occur at Superfund hazardous waste sites for which there are important data gaps impeding the full understanding of their neurotoxic effects on human health and aquatic species. These data gaps include an understanding of mechanisms of toxicity, inter-individual or gender susceptibility, and biogeochemical factors that govern their fate in their environment. A key theme of our projects is addressing the role of cellular oxidative stress during metal-induced neurotoxicity. The UW program will include four research projects (two environmental science and two biomedical projects). The research projects include investigations of (1) mechanisms and biomarkers of metal olfactory injury to Pacific salmon, with a primary focus on cadmium; (2) cellular and molecular mechanisms of cadmium-mediated neurotoxicity in rodents, including effects on olfaction and cognition; (3) the role of paraoxonases as modifiers of cadmium and manganese neurotoxicity; and (4) biogeochemistry and bioavailability of arsenic in an urbanized lake system in Washington State. Our projects include collaborations among projects and cores, and each project is interdisciplinary in nature.

"9304851","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary hyperoxaluria type I (PH1) and renal Fanconi's syndrome are two rare kidney diseases that share a common theme in which a peroxisomal protein is mistargeted to mitochondria. As additional kidney diseases are diagnosed with genome-wide association studies, this theme in which proteins are mistargeted to mitochondria is likely to become more common, because mitochondrial targeting sequences are degenerate. PH1 is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the gene coding for alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT/AGXT, protein abbrev. AGT). PH1 is marked by an inability to efficiently metabolize glyoxylate, leading to the accumulation of calcium oxalate in various bodily tissues, especially the kidney. In addition to uremia, which can be transiently treated by dialysis, patients have other complications such as neuropathy from excess oxalates. Administration of pyridoxine (B6), a cofactor of AGT, has alleviated some symptoms in a subset of patients; however, adequate treatments are lacking and the disease is typically terminal. Whereas some mutations in AGT result in protein activation, a subset of mutations (one-third of patients have an allele with 2 point mutations, P11L and G170R) results in mistargeting of functional AGT from peroxisomes, where it is active in humans (omnivores), to mitochondria, which is the normal location in carnivores. Similarly, renal Fanconi's syndrome is caused by mistargeting of the peroxisomal bifunctional enzyme (PBE, coded by EHHADH) to mitochondria. PBE subsequently blocks mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, resulting in an autosomal dominant disease.  Our hypothesis is that small molecules that attenuate mitochondrial protein import are significant for dissecting the molecular mechanisms in AGT/PBE trafficking and, long-term, as a therapeutic strategy to retarget the protein from mitochondria back to peroxisomes. We have completed a high throughput in vivo screen in yeast to find attenuators of mitochondrial protein translocation. Strong preliminary data supports that these small molecule probes attenuate import in both yeast and mammalian mitochondria. Moreover, small molecule candidates have been identified that indeed retarget AGT from mitochondria back to peroxisomes and these probes are well tolerated by cells. Thus, the small molecules partially inhibit mitochondrial protein translocation at a level that is not toxic to cels. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) to elucidate the specific trafficking pathway of AGT in cells; (2) to characterize the mechanism by which the small molecules retarget AGT from mitochondria to peroxisomes and to determine if the small molecules may be beneficial for patients with different mutations in AGT; and (3) to study the trafficking pathway of PBE mistargeting to mitochondria. This study is relevant to public health because of the potential development of new strategies to understand and treat kidney diseases."
"9370728","Project Summary/Abstract  Obesity is a highly prevalent and costly disease, but effective and non-invasive treatment options are severely limited. The amylin system is considered a promising candidate for the development of novel anti- obesity pharmacotherapies, as amylin agonists decrease food intake and produce weight loss in humans and animal models. The ventral tegmental area (VTA), a mesolimbic nucleus with critical roles in feeding and motivated behavior, is a physiologically and pharmacologically relevant site of action for the energy balance effects of amylin. However, the mechanisms underlying VTA amylin receptor-mediated hypophagia remain unresolved. In particular, the impacts of key variables like sex and diet on the ability of VTA amylin receptor activation to promote negative energy balance are unknown. The overarching goal of this proposal is to identify novel neuroanatomical and behavioral mechanisms by which VTA amylin receptor signaling promotes hypophagia and weight loss, with particular focus on the role of sex and diet in these effects. This award will facilitate the applicant's advancement toward becoming a fully independent PI by exploring new topics in mesolimbic amylin signaling and generating crucial preliminary data for a future R01 application. Specific Aim I uses an innovative combination of virogenetics and behavioral pharmacology to test whether stimulation of VTA-projecting neurons in the lateral hypothalamus, a central source of amylin, activates VTA amylin receptors to control energy balance. This will expand our knowledge by investigating the inputs to VTA amylin receptors, and will provide insight into sex and diet differences by testing male and female rats maintained on chow or high-fat diet (HFD). Specific Aim II evaluates the physiological relevance of VTA amylin receptors for long-term energy balance control in females by testing the feeding and body weight effects of VTA amylin receptor knockdown. This Aim also examines the phenotype of VTA amylin receptor-expressing cells in females with a combination of immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. The studies described in this application build upon the applicant's current K01 award by investigating the neural circuits and behavioral mechanisms by which VTA amylin receptor signaling controls energy balance, and by addressing dietary influences (e.g., palatable HFD or bland chow) on the VTA amylin system. These studies are also distinct from the aims of the K01 by exploring a novel and important topic: the role of sex differences in mesolimbic amylin signaling. These studies are designed to produce informative data that will serve as a generative starting point for follow-up questions to be addressed in an R01 application. The novel combination of in vivo and ex vivo techniques used in the proposed studies will further our understanding of the distributed actions of amylin in the brain for energy balance control, filling important gaps in our scientific knowledge that may further the development of novel amylin-based pharmacotherapies for the treatment of obesity."
"9271190","DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant): This is a competitive renewal application for a grant that supports the Biotechnology Resource for NMR Molecular Imaging of Proteins at the University of California, San Diego. The BTRC develops and applies NMR spectroscopy for the study of proteins in biological supermolecular structures, such as virus particles and membranes. Successful applications of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to proteins have been largely limited to the same class of soluble, globular proteins that are amenable to X-ray crystallography. However, methods that work well with globular proteins typically work poorly with membrane proteins in their native crystalline phospholipid bilayer environment. It is this technology gap that we seek to fill. The BTRC is highly focused on advancing the technology for high-resolution solid-state NMR spectroscopy so that it can be used in laboratories throughout the World to determine the structure of membrane proteins under near-native conditions. It is this unique technology that we will make available to the Nation's biomedical research community through our Collaborative (CP) and Service (SP) research projects. Membrane proteins are important targets for structural studies because they represent about one-third of the proteins expressed from the genomes of all organisms and have many unique roles, including as drug receptors where they have their greatest biomedical roles. Primary targets for the research at the BTRC include G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are the largest class of membrane proteins and of drug receptors. Information about their structures will help guide the development of new drugs for a wide range of diseases, ranging from cancer to mental illness."
"9353397","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposal outlines a 4-year career development plan for Dr. Mark Hanudel, a pediatric nephrologist beginning an academic career as a physician-scientist. The program is designed to help him develop into an independent and productive scientific researcher at the forefront of the field of FGF23 metabolism, and eventually in other aspects of chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD). FGF23 is a bone- derived phosphaturic hormone, levels of which increase very early in CKD and are associated with adverse ?off target? effects, including increased overall mortality, increased cardiovascular morbidity, and the development of ventricular hypertrophy. Physiologic regulation of FGF23 is complex, multifaceted, and remains incompletely understood. In addition to mineral metabolism factors, iron deficiency and erythropoietin have been shown to affect FGF23 production and metabolism. As iron deficiency anemia and erythropoietin use are exceedingly common in the CKD population, these novel determinants of FGF23 are especially relevant and deserving of further study. Insights into how iron and erythropoietin affect FGF23 may lead to new CKD therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing CKD-associated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Dr. Hanudel will benefit from close interactions with his primary mentors, Dr. Tomas Ganz, a leader in the fields of anemia and iron metabolism, and Dr. Isidro Salusky, a leader in the fields of mineral metabolism and CKD. Through UCLA?s Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) and Children?s Discovery and Innovation Institute (CDI), Dr. Hanudel will have access to numerous career development seminars addressing such topics as grant writing, manuscript preparation, and ethical research. He will take graduate courses to obtain further training in molecular biology, and will also complete and defend his Master of Science in Clinical Research thesis, furthering his biostatistical training. Dr. Hanudel has the full support of his institution, and his career development will benefit from the vast resources at UCLA, a world-renowned research university. The research plan aims to investigate the regulation of bioactive FGF23 concentrations by erythropoietin, iron, and phosphate, as well as the modulating effect of CKD on FGF23 bioactivity. Specific Aim 1 seeks to investigate the mechanisms by which erythropoietin affects bone Fgf23 expression. In mice with normal and impaired kidney function, Dr. Hanudel will examine how treatment with erythropoiesis stimulating agents affects bone Fgf23 expression and circulating FGF23 levels, and explore the mechanisms that mediate these effects. Specific Aim 2 seeks to investigate the mechanisms by which erythropoietin, iron, phosphate, and CKD affect FGF23 cleavage mechanisms. This project seeks to provide important mechanistic insights regarding the novel association between iron deficiency anemia and FGF23 in CKD. With this work, Dr. Hanudel aims to advance our knowledge of the intersection between CKD-associated anemia and CKD-MBD, potentially improving current CKD therapeutic strategies."
"9330848","Project Summary The objective of the proposed project is to investigate the potential of the gasotransmitter carbon monoxide (CO) to prevent delayed graft function (DGF) and chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) in kidney transplant using a novel oral formulation of CO (HBI-002). A significant series of studies, both in vitro and in vivo, demonstrate that CO has cytoprotective properties through anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic processes, primarily through the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1)/CO pathway, where HO-1 degrades heme into iron, biliverdin and CO. A variety of studies in preclinical models of kidney transplant and other solid organ transplant, suggest the potential of CO to favorably affect the DGF and CAN. We have strong, published proof-of-concept data in pigs and rats that inhaled CO offers a substantial benefit to reduce ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) and DGF and improve renal function post-transplant. These studies provide compelling support for a potential beneficial role of CO in kidney transplant. The safety and tolerability of CO has been demonstrated in four successfully completed Phase 1 studies and three Phase 2 studies of CO using a variety of forms of CO administration. The absence of toxicity of CO at low levels of carboxy-hemoglobin (COHb) has been well defined in the literature, providing supportive safety data for the targeted COHb levels being considered for the treatment of kidney transplant. HBI-002, a liquid formulation of CO, is being developed for the prevention of DGF in kidney transplant. The administration of a defined dose of CO delivered by oral administration of HBI-002 enables the further development of CO as a therapeutic while obviating the problems associated with previously studied inhaled or intravenously administered carrier-metal CO, including environmental safety and dosing (inhaled CO) and carrier molecule toxicity (carrier-metal bound CO). Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies in mice and rats have demonstrated proof-of-concept feasibility, tolerability, and bioavailability. The next step in development is to determine the optimal dose and dose regimen for HBI-002 administration to improve outcomes in appropriate kidney transplant animal models and to better understand the potential mechanism(s) of graft protection."

"8112390","There is considerable evidence supporting a causal role for T-lymphocytes, monocytes, and monocytederived  macrophages in the initiation, progression, and complications of the atherosclerosis in man as  well as in experimental models. Plaque rupture is thought to be the trigger event for acute coronary  syndromes in man, and several mouse models of plaque rupture have recently been described. Lesion  macrophages in particular have been implicated in plaque rupture by releasing de-stabilizing proteases.  Notably, there is evidence for continued recruitment of circulating monocytes into arterial lesions in  experimental atherosclerosis, particularly in the rupture-prone shoulder. Moreover, adhesion receptors  may also regulate critical functions of emigrated leukocytes resident in lesions, including activation and  survival. Thus, the adhesion molecules that mediate monocyte trafficking into the arterial wall a potentially  attractive target in advanced as well as early disease.Studies to date of human and experimental lesions  suggest a significant role for endothelial VCAM-1 and its major leukocyte counter-receptor VLA-4 (cc4(31)  in the early phase of disease, but have not examined the role of VLA-4 or VCAM-1 in the progression of  established atherosclerosis or its late complications such as plaque rupture. Since antagonists of VLA-4  have already progressed to clinical trials in other indications, the importance of VLA-4 and VCAM-1  interactions in the progression and late complications of atherosclerosis is a clinically relevant question as  patients are most often identified in this stage of the disease.  We hypothesize that the VLA-4 and VCAM-1 play important roles in monocyte and T-lymphocyte  recruitment to advanced as well as early lesions and that disruption of these adhesion pathways will  reduce progression of established lesions and prevent plaque rupture. In order to test this hypothesis, we  will utilize a recently developed mouse model in which interferon-induced Cre-loxP-mediated deletion of  the ot4 gene can be achieved at any time post-natal. These a4-deleted animals will be studied in both the  ApoE-/- (Aim 1) and LDRL-/- (Aim 2) background, allowing us to define for the first time the contribution of  VLA-4 in the progression of established lesions and plaque rupture as well as in lesion initiation. To  complement the VLA-4 studies, we will also examine the role of VCAM-1 in lesion initiation/progression in  a model of conditional knockout of endothelial VCAM-1 (Aim 3)."
"9339972","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pain associated with fibromyalgia interferes with daily function, work, and social activities resulting in a decreased quality of life. People with fibromyalgia also have a significant amount fatigue and a fear of movement. People with fibromyalgia show enhanced excitability of pain neurons in the central nervous system and reduced pain inhibition. Therefore, one of the main treatments for patients with fibromyalgia must focus on pain relief to allow the person to function more independently both at home and at work. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is used by health professionals to deliver electrical stimulation through the skin for pain control. Basic science studies, from the PIs laboratory, show that TENS activates descending pain inhibitory pathways to inhibit excitability of pain neurons. Thus, the ideal patient population for the treatment of TENS would be one in which there is enhanced central excitability and reduced inhibition; fibromyalgia is such a condition. We hypothesize that application of TENS to patients with fibromyalgia will reduce movement-related pain and reduce central excitability by restoring central inhibition, and that this decrease in pain and/or central excitability will reduce fatigue and fear of movement, thereby improving function and quality of life. We will test this hypothesis through 4 Specific Aims. Aim 1: test the effectiveness of repeated use of TENS on movement-related pain in people with fibromyalgia with random assignment to three treatments: standard care, placebo TENS and active TENS. Aim 2: test if pain reduction by TENS results in a concomitant decrease in fatigue and fear of movement, and an increase in function and quality of life. Outcome measures will include physical function by directly assessing daily activity with an accelerometer, as well as performing specific functional tasks. Aim 3: determine if active TENS alters pain processing in people with fibromyalgia and if improvement in clinical symptoms correlates with normalization of pain processing physiology. We will evaluate change in these physiologic parameters in responders versus non-responders as assessed clinically. Aim 4: determine if PROMIS is a useful outcome for fibromyalgia by comparing to the revised version of the fibromyalgia impact questionnaire (FIQ-R)."
"9410320","Project Summary Aneuploidy, the situation in which a cell has too many or too few chromosomes, is the leading genetic abnormality causing infertility, miscarriage, and failure in in vitro fertilization. Maternally derived errors in the first meiotic division are one of the primary sources of these aneuploidies. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate chromosome segregation in female gametes is critical to understanding why this unique cellular division is so error prone. The Aurora kinases are a conserved family of serine/threonine kinases critical for the regulation of accurate chromosome segregation in mitosis and meiosis. Aurora Kinase A (AURKA) and Aurora Kinase B (AURKB) are expressed in both mitotic and meiotic cells; however, Aurora Kinase C (AURKC) is only found in mammalian germ cells. The cellular functions of AURKA and AURKB in mitosis have been well defined, however, the function of the AURK's in meiosis is less understood. Due to the high sequence homology within the family studying the roles of the AURKs in meiosis has proven difficult. In this proposal I will utilize single and double knockout mouse lines in conjunction with novel genetic techniques to define the specific functions of the Aurora kinases in meiosis. In addition I will investigate the ability for AURKA to functionally compensate for AURKB and AURKC in vivo. Results from this proposal will determine how the specificity of aurora kinase function is established and the molecular mechanisms by which the family mediates accurate chromosome segregation in meiosis I. This research will help bring clarity to the field in regards to the roles of the AURKs in female meiosis and may shed light onto why this cellular division is so error prone. Hypothesis 1: AURKB maintains non-overlapping functions from AURKC in female meiosis. Aim I: AURKB is required for female meiosis to maintain the spindle assembly checkpoint and sister chromatid cohesion. Hypothesis 2: AURKA is capable of maintaining AURKB and AURKC specific functions in vivo. Aim 2: Examine the compensatory ability of AURKA to maintain canonical AURKB and AURKC functions in meiosis. "
"9385556","ABSTRACT Wolfram syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, optic nerve atrophy, hearing loss, and neurodegeneration. The prognosis of this syndrome is currently poor and many patients die prematurely with severe neurological disabilities, raising the urgency for developing novel treatments for Wolfram syndrome. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) dysfunction caused by the mutations in the WFS1 gene is the root cause of the disease. However, key molecular defects linking ER dysfunction to death of pancreatic ? cells, neurons, and retinal ganglion cells in Wolfram syndrome are not clear. Therefore, despite the underlying importance of ER dysfunction in Wolfram syndrome, no current therapies target the ER. We have recently reported that the leakage of ER calcium to the cytosol, followed by subsequent increase in cytoplasmic calcium levels, induces death of ? cells and neurons in Wolfram syndrome. We have also reported that dantrolene, an FDA-approved drug for spasticity and malignant hyperthermia, can prevent death of ? cells and neurons in cell models of Wolfram syndrome. Dantrolene targets ryanodine receptors localized to the ER and blocks ER calcium leakage to the cytosol. Preclinical studies in my lab revealed that dantrolene could prevent the progression of diabetes and maintain ? cell mass in a mouse model of Wolfram syndrome. These results raised the possibility that ER calcium stabilizers might be promising therapeutics for the treatment of Wolfram syndrome. This prompted us to identify other ER calcium stabilizers under ER stress conditions using a computational algorithm and led to the discovery of JTV-519 (a.k.a., K201) as a novel candidate compound. JTV-519 acts in the ER. It binds to and stabilizes the ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) in its closed state and was previously evaluated for the treatment of atrial fibrillation recurrence. In this proposal, we will test the efficacy of JTV-519 in cell and mouse models of Wolfram syndrome and conduct phase 1b clinical trial of JTV-519 in patients with Wolfram syndrome."
"9209433","Project Summary (Project 4) Genomic instability, which leads to genetic changes associated with progression of cancer to more aggressive phenotypes and ultimately the development of resistance to therapy, is a prominent feature of multiple myeloma (MM). Understanding genomic instability and its underlying mechanisms is, therefore, extremely important to develop therapeutic strategies which would suppress clonal evolution and its impact on genomic and clinical outcome. In previous funding period, we defined the mutational spectrum in MM at the time of initial diagnosis and found heterogeneity across samples, with largely distinct sets of chromosomal rearrangements and gene mutations present in individual patients. Importantly, serial sampling of patient MM cells revealed diverse patterns of clonal evolution, including linear evolution, differential clonal response, or branching evolution. We also identified at least two biologically distinct mutational signatures responsible for the majority of observed mutations, suggesting a pattern of parallel, divergent, or even convergent evolution. Interestingly, the number of mutations was the only factor correlating with overall as well as relapse free survival, thus highlighting the importance of understanding the mechanisms of genomic instability in MM. The clonal evolution which is probably driven by pressures from therapy, microenvironment, and inherent genomic and epigenomic mechanisms, leads to both clonal selection and formation of new clones. By deep sequencing of single gene IgH, we demonstrated that selection of very low frequency clone occurs following therapy, and that new clones may come up due to ongoing mutational changes. Consistent with our previous data which identified dysregulated homologous recombination (HR) as an important mechanism underlying genomic evolution, we have observed that patients with increased HR activity had poor event-free survival compared to the rest. We hypothesize that therapy affects both clonal selection and clonal evolution, driving the ultimate tumor genotype and phenotype that eventually emerges at relapse, suggesting that targeting underlying mechanisms of clonal evolution is necessary to achieve curative outcomes. To this end we will extend our ongoing investigations to investigate the impact of therapy on genomic instability and associated clonal selection, clonal evolution, and underlying mechanisms in MM (Sp Aim 1); identify mediators of genomic instability in MM (Sp Aim 2); and assess the ability of inhibitors of genomic instability to impact evolution of genomic changes in MM (Sp Aim 3). The proposed studies will further improve our understanding of genomic instability and progression of MM, identify novel drugs, and may facilitate the development of therapeutic strategies which would inhibit/reduce evolution and associated dismal outcome."
"9212003","The large and growing problem of drug resistance of Mtb in humans requires new approaches to determine the mechanism of multi-drug resistance and markers of the resistant state in humans. Using 116 drug resistant Mtb isolates, we used whole genome sequencing to identify Mtb mutations stastically associated to drug resistance during natural infection of humans. This unbiased and broad approach identified all of the  known genes that promote drug resistance and identified 11 genes of known function with no known  connection to drug resistance. Three of these genes (ppsA, polyketide synthase 12 and polyketide synthase 3) produce polykefides with inter-related functions in outer membrane integrity of Mtb. An independent,  mass spectromety analysis of molecules changed in a strain evolving drug resistance in vivo identified  mannosyl phosphomycoketide, the product of polyeketide synthase 12, as being inversely correlated with  resistance. Based on independent genetic and metabolomic discovery of altered polyketide synthesis  function in drug resistant strains, we will test a new model in which altered polykefide function controls cell wall integrity and drug resistance. Using patient derived strains from Lima, Peru, we seek independent validation of altered polykefide biosynthetic genes in human populations. In the laboratory, we will test  whether polykefide synthase genes and the lipids they produce influence molecular remodeling of the cell  wall, Mtb permeability changes and drug resistance. To determine if genes showing strong statistical  associations are actually causal of the drug resistant state or altered fitness, we will test measure the cell  wall components and an in vivo fitness of polyketide deficient and drug-resistanct Mtb. Finally, taking  advantage of whole organism screens that identify the particular bacterial metabolites changed in polyketide-deficient or drug resistant states, we will identify the changed molecules to give insight to the mechanism of resistance and to identify biomarkers of the drug resistant state."
"9316723","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Defining all principal components of a neural circuit, from sensory transduction to behavior, is one of the fundamental goals of neuroscience. While this presents a monumental challenge for a mammalian brain; the simpler nervous system, rich repertoire of innate behaviors, and unparalleled genetic tractability of Drosophila melanogaster afford a rare opportunity to uncover fundamentals of neural processing. To this end, our laboratory focuses on understanding how the processing of temperature stimuli in the Drosophila brain produces the appropriate aversive and attractive responses. The ability to sense temperature, thermosensation, provides organisms with critical information; yet it is one of the least understood sensory modalities. In Drosophila, rapid temperature changes are detected by dedicated hot and cold temperature receptors in the antenna, with 3 neurons responding to cooling and 3 neurons responding to heating. The axons of these cells terminate in segregated, adjacent 'hot' and 'cold' glomeruli in the brain; forming a topographic map for the representation of temperature, as demonstrated by calcium imaging. It is unclear how this spatial map of activity is processed by higher brain regions to direct behaviors. Here, I propose to map the transformation of temperature information in the Drosophila brain from sensory detection to the triggering of specific motor programs. This work will provide fundamental insights into high- level sensorimotor neuronal computations in a relatively simple system and may help explain how the brain processes all innate behaviors. In conducting these experiments, I will learn how to perform genetically targeted optogenetic stimulation with tandem two-photon optical recording and behavioral assays. Further, I will be trained in executive scientific skills such as experimental design, scientific communication, and professional networking."
"9239215","Renal ischemia-reperfusion (IR) is a leading cause of acute kidney injury (IR-AKI), a significant unsolved clinical problem. A critical barrier to progress with IR-AKI is that there are gaps in our scientific understanding of the mechanisms underlying the persistent reduction of medullary blood flow (MBF), a key factor determining the outcome of IR-AKI and the progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Our goal is to address this critical barrier by focusing on the role of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) as a potential signaling molecule contributing to renal microvascular dysfunction in IR-AKI. Our central hypothesis is that renal ischemia-reperfusion leads to significantly enhanced sensitivity of juxtamedullary afferent arterioles, the crucial vascular segment that controls MBF, to S1P-mediated vasoconstriction which contributes to a persistent reduction of MBF and a steady decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in IR-AKI. Our objectives are to address this central hypothesis by (1) determining the role of S1P in controlling juxtamedullary afferent arteriolar function and renal hemodynamics in IR-AKI; (2) establishing the cellular mechanisms of S1P- dependent regulation of afferent arteriolar reactivity in IR-AKI; and (3) determining the pathophysiological role of S1P in the development of renal microvascular dysfunction in IR-AKI. We will test this central hypothesis through three specific aims. AIM 1 will test the hypothesis that renal ischemia-reperfusion leads to enhanced sensitivity of afferent arterioles to S1P which contributes to a persistent vasoconstriction and reduction of MBF in IR-AKI. AIM 2 will test the hypothesis that the renal ischemia-reperfusion-induced increase in reactive oxygen species production contributes to enhanced S1P sensitivity of afferent arterioles in IR-AKI. AIM 3 will test the hypothesis that inhibition of S1P receptor activation prevents enhancement of S1P-mediated afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction during ischemia-reperfusion and protects against IR-AKI. We will use the in vitro blood-perfused juxtamedullary nephron technique to assess the impact of IR on S1P-mediated arteriolar response in rats and in S1P2 receptor knockout mice. We will determine the influence of S1P on total and regional renal blood flow and GFR with IR-AKI. We will determine which S1P receptors contribute to enhanced S1P-mediated vasoconstriction. We will measure sphingolipid metabolites in kidney and plasma of IR rats or mice. Our outcomes will provide new mechanistic insights that renal IR activates the S1P signaling pathway in the renal microvasculature. Exogenous S1P causes potent vasoconstriction of afferent arterioles and reduction of renal blood flow and MBF, which will be enhanced in IR-AKI. S1P2 receptor blockade or deletion will protect against IR-AKI. The results of this study will improve our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the persistent reduction of MBF and a steady decline in GFR in IR-AKI. Improving MBF by inhibiting S1P2R signaling may represent a new therapeutic target for treating IR-AKI and preventing progression to CKD, thereby having a major impact in the field."
"9375231","Project Summary (Abstract) High and uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) is a significant public health burden; therefore it is important to improve modifiable risk factors such as sleep health in efforts to reduce the societal burden, particularly among health disparate populations. The goal of this K01 is to utilize a mixed methods approach to design a pilot study aimed at improving sleep in the context of environmental stressors, with a long term aim of improving BP control and overall health of African Americans (AAs) who chronically suffer from poor sleep and are at high risk for hypertension (HTN) and HTN-associated comorbidities and mortality. I propose to: 1) Test independent and interactive associations between environmental (within the home and neighborhood) and social stressors (i.e. discrimination) with sleep patterns in an urban AA population; 2) Conduct qualitative research to inform the development of tailored interventions for improving the inter-related problems of healthy sleep and BP control in AAs, particularly to enhance understanding of several topics including the barriers and opportunities to improve sleep and related cardiovascular risk factors; and 3) Use data from the mixed methods research to develop and pilot a 12-week feasibility trial in a community setting with the primary objective to improve sleep as a strategy to improve BP control as well as other health outcomes. To address these research aims, I will leverage the infrastructure of the NIH and EPA funded Center for Research on Environmental and Social Stressors in Housing across the Life Course (CRESSH) co- directed by the primary mentor of this proposal. CRESSH has two projects that will be leveraged: 1) Home- based Observation and Monitoring Exposure study of a multiethnic mixed income population in Boston, MA; and 2) the Mapping Spatial Patterns in Environmental Health Disparities study. I will utilize existing data from CRESSH (7 days of real time monitored environmental stressors (noise, temperature, NO2, PM2.5, ultrafine particles, ventilation) and social stressors) as well as prospectively collect new data among AAs sampled from CRESSH and the same communities as CRESSH participants. I propose to conduct: a) 7-day wrist actigraphy to characterize sleep/wake times, sleep timing and quality of sleep; b) in-depth focus groups to identify barriers and opportunities for improving sleep; and c) complete a home environmental audit to characterize the physical and social environment. The overall goal of this career development award is to develop an independent research program aimed at understanding the root causes of sleep health disparities and their impact on cardiovascular outcomes including HTN, and designing culturally and environmentally appropriate interventions. Through research and new training in mixed methods, community-based/behavioral interventions and environmental and cardiovascular epidemiology, this award will facilitate my transition to an independent investigator in the field of sleep epidemiology and cardiovascular health disparities and will allow my research to serve as a lever for public health interventions and policy.  "
"9411209","Abstract Effect anti-HIV drugs have focused on a limited number of targets. While these drugs are currently highly efficacious there is a need to continue to develop new targets for two reasons. First, it is possible that over the course of treating infected people for the decades to come drug resistance could become a problem; thus developing new targets and inhibitors now provides the theoretical underpinning for the development of new drugs in the future. Second, inhibitors represent chemical probes that can complement genetic approaches in terms of studying biological phenomena. Thus inhibitors that are not drugs still have intrinsic value as tools in understanding complex biological systems. We have previously shown that the MA/CA protease cleavage site in the HIV-1 Gag protein must be cleaved to near completion to allow an infectious virus particle to form. Even 10% under-cleavage of this site poisons the assembly process, likely because some of the uncleaved MA/CA fusion protein participates in capsid formation and poisons this highly regulated process. Bevirimat formed a conceptual basis for thinking about inhibitors of specific cleavage sites, in this case CA/SP1. However, among all of the cleavage sites in Gag the MA/CA cleavage site is by far the most sensitive to under-processing to affect infectivity. For this reason we undertook to develop a biochemical assay that could be used in a high throughput screen for small molecule inhibitors. That screen (775,000 compounds screened by SRI) is now completed with the most active compounds having an IC50 starting at 1 uM. These compounds have already been shown not to be HIV-1 protease inhibitors. In this application we propose four aims. First, we will test the most active compounds in a secondary screen using our two-substrate gel-based assay that includes both the target MA/CA substrate and as an internal control a substrate that can be cleaved by the HIV-1 protease but which should not be a target of the inhibitor. Second, we will measure EC50s for viral replication using a novel assay that will greatly enhance our sensitivity to detect specific inhibition. Third, we will measure EC50s for a panel of transmitted/founder viruses and viruses from different clades to provide an initial assessment of the effect of sequence variability on sensitivity. And fourth, for those compounds that have a sufficient therapeutic index we will start to select for resistance to validate the MA/CA target.

"9346638","Project Summary The last several years have witnessed growing interest in the potential contribution of the ?built environment? to the epidemic increase in obesity rates in the United States. This includes both the large structural aspects of the neighborhood and physical characteristics of homes and schools at the very micro level (the interiors and associated grounds of these buildings). The structural aspects of the neighborhood that surround the home and school includes urban design features such as streets and highways, land use mix, street connectivity, public transportation infrastructure (i.e., subway stations), park land, and recreational infrastructure, all of which could affect both physical activity and the accessibility of food and other resources. The physical characteristics of the home or school?including building size, the presence of elevators, stairs, spaces for physical activity, and related factors?could determine opportunities for physical activity and amount of activity needed to navigate the space. Thus far not established is how each of these factors contributes to childhood BMI in a distinct and interconnected way and/or how changes in such factors could influence obesity rates in a causal manner. This gap in knowledge is particularly troubling given the high cost of changing the built environment as well as the longevity of investments once made. Our research promises to provide insight critical to policymakers planning urban infrastructure investment. Particularly important to consider are disparities, and whether differences in the built environment could explain differences in obesity rates in key demographic groups, including income and race/ethnicity. We propose to combine New York City Department of Education FITNESSGRAM data, which includes BMI, school and residential locations, for all New York City public school children from 2005 onward, with detailed data on the built environment surrounding each child?s home and school as well as within their home and school. Then, we will use a variety of enhanced methodological techniques to estimate a less-biased, more causal relationship between the built environment and obesity. The methodological enhancements we utilize over past work are:  ? A large, detailed dataset, including data on over 1 million NYC public school children.  ? Examining longitudinally the same children over time, using both child, school and census tract level  fixed effects, among other methods, to determine casualty.  ? Examining fine-grained differences in the built environment. For example, the relative influence of  living within 500 feet of a park or other built environment resources  ? Data on both the home and school built environment, both inside the building and in the  neighborhood, modeled together. With these enhancements, we will be able to provide improved estimates on the influence of the built environment on child BMI, substantially answering key health and policy-related questions."
"9312991","ABSTRACT Suicide is the second leading cause of death for American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/ANs) ages 10-34, while rates for AI/ANs younger than 25 years are up to 6 times higher than for Whites of similar ages. Most research has been limited to rural reservation settings, yet 71% of AI/ANs reside in urban areas. This ?invisible tribe? faces unique challenges stemming from its lack of connection with traditional family and cultural environments. Urban AI/AN youth and young adults are at notably higher risk than their non-AI/AN counterparts for attempted suicide (21% vs. 7%), and for serious mental health problems, substance abuse, gang activity, teen pregnancy, and interpersonal abuse. Yet, most people who die by suicide have contact with a primary care provider in the prior year, and 45% are seen in the month before their death. ?Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment? (SBIRT) is an evidence-based practice that co-locates behavioral health clinicians in primary care teams and substantially reduces suicide risk through immediate intervention by behavioral health clinicians. However, retention in SBIRT has been a challenge and it has not been tested in urban AI/ANs to screen for suicidality (suicidal thoughts or behaviors). We have partnered with 2 large Urban Indian Health Organizations ? the Seattle Indian Health Board and First Nations Community Healthsource in Albuquerque to evaluate their existing SBIRT programs. We will also test a novel enhancement that sends caring text messages, which have been adapted from similar empirically-based, effective interventions for suicide prevention. The text messages are intended to improve SBIRT retention and increase social and cultural connectedness, which are strong protective factors against suicidality and death. During the 3-year study, we will randomly assign 2,400 AI/AN patients ages 12-34 who screen positive for suicidal ideation to usual care (SBIRT+referral to existing resources) or SBIRT with either 6 months (SBIRT+6) or 12 months (SBIRT+12) of text messages. Primary outcomes will be self-reported suicidal ideation, attempts, and suicide- related hospitalizations for 1 year after randomization. Secondary outcomes will include perceived social connectedness and retention. Given the value of sustainability, we will also conduct an economic evaluation. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) Evaluate SBIRT programs at our study sites to identify and address factors that affect their successful implementation; 2) Compare the effectiveness of SBIRT+6 and SBIRT+12 to usual care for reducing suicidal ideation, attempts, and hospitalizations; and for increasing social connectedness and retention in SBIRT; and 3) Perform an rigorous economic evaluation of SBIRT+6 and SBIRT+12 compared to usual care to examine their effects on use of healthcare resources and quality of life. Given the stigma attached to mental illness, few AI/AN youth and young adults seek help for suicidality. Challenges of retention and follow-up underscore the need for innovative means of engagement beyond the clinic. Our work is aligned with the Surgeon General's National Strategy for Suicide Prevention that identifies connectedness to others as the primary protective factor against suicidality."

"9276142","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a dominantly inherited, fatal neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by progressive motor incoordination and bulbar dysfunction, due primarily to destruction of cerebellar Purkinje cells (eventually the inferior olive and brain stem cranial nuclei are also compromised). Caused by expansion of a translated CAG repeat that encodes a polyglutamine tract in ATAXIN1 (ATXN1) and that alters ATXN1's interactions with its native protein partners, SCA1 shares several features with other more common neurodegenerative proteinopathies such as Parkinson and Alzheimer disease. Two are central to this grant: first, the disease-driving protein is prone to accumulate in neurons; second, there is differential vulnerability to disease pathology among different brain regions despite ubiquitous expression of the disease- driving protein. Over the past four years we have made significant progress investigating the molecular basis of both these features. We discovered that the elevation of steady-state levels of mutant ATXN1, not the aggregation per se, is toxic, and that the toxicity of mutant ATXN1 is primarily due to a gain of its normal functions, particularly those mediated by its native protein partner Capicua-at least in the cerebellum. We therefore explored whether reducing ATXN1 levels mitigates disease. We found that genetic reduction of Capicua (which in turn reduces the activity of both mutant and wild-type ATXN1) mitigates the cerebellar phenotype of SCA1 knock-in mice, as does reduction of 14-3-3e (one of ATXN1's stabilizing binding partners). Our recent unbiased, cross-species, forward genetic screen also revealed that partial inhibition of the RAS- MAPK-MSK1 pathway rescues the cerebellar phenotype. Unfortunately, neither Capicua, 14-3-3, nor ATXN1 itself are viable therapeutic targets at present-but the RAS-MAPK-MSK1 pathway provides a number of druggable targets and, indeed, there are already several drugs used in human patients that inhibit this pathway. In this grant, we propose to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pharmacological inhibitors of the RAS- MAPK-MSK1 pathway (Aim I), as well as screen for additional modifiers that reduce ATXN1 levels in both human cells and our SCA1 Drosophila model (Aim II). Given that SCA1 is a chronic disease, it is likely that combination therapy that mildly inhibits two to three distinct pathways controlling ATXN1 levels will be much safer and better tolerated by patients. We will also investigate region-specific modifications and interactions of ATXN1 to identify those critical for ATXN1 toxicity, using our newly generated mice carrying tagged knock-in Atxn1 alleles for the wild-type and mutant proteins (Aim III). This is not only to find pathways that may mitigate extra-cerebellar symptoms, but to gain further biological insight into ATXN1 functions in both SCA1 pathogenesis and development. The proposed studies stand to identify viable potential therapeutic entry points for SCA1 and provide a strategy and insights relevant to other neurodegenerative proteinopathies."
"9433761","?     DESCRIPTION:   Hemoglobin (Hb)-based oxygen (O2) carriers (HBOCs) are currently being developed as red blood cell (RBC) substitutes for use in transfusion medicine. Despite significant commercial development, recent late stage clinical results of polymerized hemoglobin (PolyHb) solutions (i.e. Hemopure? (OPK Biotech, Cambridge, MA), a glutaraldehyde polymerized bovine Hb; and PolyHeme? (Northfield Laboratories Inc., Evanston, IL), a glutaraldehyde polymerized pyridoxylated human Hb) hamper further development. Both of these commercial products elicit vasoconstriction at the microcirculatory level, and lead to the development of systemic hypertension and oxidative tissue damage. These side-effects are hypothesized to occur either by a nitric oxide (NO) scavenging or oxygen (O2) oversupply mechanism and are both exacerbated by PolyHb extravasation into the tissue space. In light of these 2 potential mechanisms, it is apparent that PolyHb size will have a profound impact on the extent of vasoconstriction, systemic hypertension and oxidative tissue toxicity.  Therefore in this  application, we hypothesize that PolyHb size will regulate vasoconstriction at the microcirculatory level, systemic hypertension and tissue oxidative damage. In order to test this hypothesis, we plan to synthesize several PolyHbs of varying size in the low O2 affinity state by cross-linking/polymerizing bovine Hb using the cross-linking agent glutaraldehyde. In order to test the central hypothesis of this application, we propose 3 specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Analyze the role of endothelial function on the development of oxidative tissue injury to PolyHbs of varying size. Specific Aim 2: Analyze cardiac function in the presence of PolyHbs of varying size. Specific Aim 3: Evaluate the ability of PolyHb to restore perfusion and oxygenation after resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock.  The proposed work is both significant and innovative, since it seeks to develop safe and efficacious PolyHbs for use in transfusion medicine. In addition, state-of-the-art biophysical techniques and two unique animal models will be used to understand PolyHb physiological responses and determine the clinical potential of these novel materials."
"9403487","Bacterial pathogens must adapt to changing environments in vivo in order to persist during infection within their host. Identifying genes that are functionally required for survival and fitness of the pathogen within the host helps to better understand pathogenesis, inform genome annotations, and guide the development of new therapeutic approaches. Tn-seq is a powerful genetic approach that allows researchers to identify en masse genes that are important for fitness in vivo using relevant models of infection. Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus, GAS) is a strict human pathogen and is listed among the top 10 causes of acutely life threatening bacterial infections worldwide, causing a wide array of diseases from self-limiting superficial infections of the skin & throat to severe invasive diseases of soft tissues & sterile sites. Our group has established the tools and experience to perform genome-wide genetic screens in GAS using the clinically relevant M1T1 strain 5448, and we have now completed the first in vivo Tn-seq of GAS infection in a murine model of localized GAS soft tissue infection to identify genes necessary for fitness during ulcerative lesion formation. Amongst our dataset, we identified two unannotated genes (called here subcutaneous fitness genes scfA and scfB) that were extremely important for GAS fitness in the lesion at both 24 and 48 hours post infection. Both genes are uncharacterized in GAS, but are predicted to encode membrane-associated proteins and are highly conserved among Firmicutes. The only study on scfAB homologs in the literature found them to be critical for the acid stress response and biofilm formation in S. mutans; suggesting that ScfAB functioned as a membrane permease complex. Our preliminary studies found that defined GAS M1T1 5448 mutants in scfA and scfB were outcompeted by wild type in vivo and were attenuated for survival following single strain infection in the soft tissue model. We hypothesize that the scfAB genes play an integral role in enhancing adaptation of GAS during murine soft tissue infection, and potentially in other host environments, through an as yet unknown mechanism that might involve membrane transport. The primary goal in this R21 proposal is to explore the role of ScfA and ScfB in GAS physiology and pathogenesis, with the expectation that this work will advance our understanding of how they might contribute to other important G+ pathogens. Thus, we seek to establish the contribution of scfAB to the pathophysiology of GAS via two aims: 1) Establish the localization, regulation and function of scfAB in GAS cell physiology, and 2) Investigate the impact of scfAB on GAS pathogenesis and colonization."
"9212001","Although only a minority of individuals infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis progress to active disease,  host factors associated with progression are only poorly understood. Recent data show that metabolic risk  factors such as low body-mass index, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus are strong predictors  of an individual's risk of progressing to active disease after infection. Further, growing evidence suggests a  link between an individual's metabolic state and control of human macrophage and dendritic cell activation  and differentiation pathways. Here, we propose to identify key host metabolic pathways involved in TB  progression in a genetic study of an existing TB exposed cohort and then test these associations by  performing observational studies in humans and intervention studies in guinea pig models. First, we will  leverage our existing cohort of microbiologically confirmed TB index cases and their exposed, infected  household contacts who have remained disease free for two years after exposure. Using a nested case  control study design, we will assess the impact of genetic variants known to affect key metabolic traits as  well as rare coding variants on TB progression using exome chips that are optimized for the Peruvian  population in which we work. Second, we will use the results of this study to guide further validation of these  determinants through transcriptional profiling of human myeloid cells from cases and exposed non-diseased  controls. In a sub-study, we will also these exome chip and transcriptional profiling data to identify the genes  involved in dendritic cell maturation as assessed by genes related to CD1, interleukin-1 and NFkappaB. To  further explore the impact of these metabolic and immune pathways, we will conduct TB infection  experiments in guinea pigs in which metabolic status is modified through dietary and pharmacological  interventions with the aim of identifying possible therapeutic interventions that could moved to human trials in  future work."
"9241785","Project Summary  Despite dramatic improvements in life expectancy with modern antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV-infected individuals remain at higher risk than the general population for many morbidities including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). While this increased risk appears to be associated with persistent systemic inflammation despite suppressive ART in preliminary studies, the specific immunologic pathways mediating this effect remain unclear.  The long-term goal of this proposal is to determine the immunologic signatures that predict progressive insulin resistance in treated HIV infection. There is now compelling evidence to indicate that T2DM pathogenesis in the general population is spurred on by age-related chronic low-grade inflammation in the white adipose tissue (WAT) that is driven by resident macrophages, particularly in the context of obesity. Interestingly, a redistribution of WAT stores within the body and an increase in visceral adiposity is seen in HIV-infected people where viral suppression has been maintained by antiretroviral therapy (ART), and several indicators highlight that a form of chronic inflammation potentially analogous to that seen in obesity is also brought on by immunological reconstitution in the setting of chronic HIV, even in non-obese individuals.  Leveraging an exceptionally well characterized longitudinal cohort of HIV-infected participants (SCOPE), the objective of this proposal is to use systemic, adipose tissue-specific, and cutting-edge radiographic imaging tools to identify tissue-specific, cellular, and molecular biomarkers of progressive glucose dysregulation, with a particular focus on pro-inflammatory myeloid cell subpopulations. The aim is to find immunologic signatures that are strongly associated with incident T2DM and that also predict worsening glucose control over time.  The impact of this proposal lies in its potential to identify specific immunologic pathways that mediate the increased risk of T2DM in treated HIV infection to identify targets for novel interventions."
"9355462","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite advances in therapies over the past 3 decades, up to 30% of RA patients continue to live with uncontrolled disease even with frequent switching of DMARD and biological therapies suggesting that RA is a heterogeneous disease that may evolve over a lifetime. The cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie the heterogeneity of RA are largely unknown. A detailed understanding of the pathways responsible for the differential responses of RA patients to treatment would be invaluable to facilitate the optimization of treatment regimens for individual RA patients and allow the implementation of effective `treat-to-target approaches. This proposal will take advantage of unique cohorts of RA patients and a well-integrated multidisciplinary team of clinicians and scientists at the Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS), the New York Genome Center (NYGC) and Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH) at the University of Toronto to gain a broad understanding of the molecular pathways that control the function of these distinct cellular compartments in different clinical settings. Or major goals are to: a) utilize the unparalleled access of HSS physicians to over 26,000 surgical cases/year to obtain paired samples of peripheral blood and synovial tissues from RA and control patients undergoing surgical procedures to perform detailed cellular, molecular, and histological analyses aimed at uncovering molecular pathways whose deregulation is shared between peripheral blood samples and tissue specimens, b) exploit the phenomenon of disease worsening or flare in patients discontinuing DMARDs and biologics during the perioperative period, to perform longitudinal studies to unmask pathways that distinguish flaring vs. non-flaring patients, and c) extend the results obtained from these initial studies to cohorts of early RA patients observed longitudinally who are DMARD and/or TNF responders versus non-responders."
"9322857","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Three major academic centers propose to collaborate as a combined clinical-technology site. The 2 clinical centers, NYU School of Medicine and Albert Einstein College of Medicine, have a rich and long history of commitment to SLE and together currently treat ~1,000 SLE patients. They will jointly assemble a renal phenotype-driven patient cohort comprising diverse ethnic/racial backgrounds. The Multi-Ethnic Translational Research Optimization (METRO) Lupus Consortium cohort will be leveraged to develop, standardize and validate advanced technologies to identify critical signaling pathways in tissues (renal and skin), cells and urine. Given the widespread vasculopathy characteristic of SLE, endothelial cell activation in the tubulointerstitium in lupus nephritis (LN) may be accompanied by similar activation, even in nonlesional skin. Molecular analysis of gene expression and signaling in specific subsets of renal cells may precede and predict the pathologic processes that lead to end organ damage and provide insights to deconstruct the heterogeneity of lupus in general and the histologic class of renal disease in particular. Furthermore, the faithful reflection of a relevant pathway in renal tissue by a more readily accessible tissue or fluid compartment would pave the way to early identification and treatment, critical to renal survival. Because SLE is strongly associated with racial/ethnic disparities, studies need to address whether specific biological pathways and drug targets are race-/ethnicity- dependent. Accordingly, METRO will comprise substantial numbers of Black, Hispanic, Asian, and White patients recruited at NYU (PI Buyon) and Einstein (PI Putterman). PI Dr. Thomas Tuschl at The Rockefeller University brings expertise and extensive experience in coding and non-coding RNAseq analysis and RNA diagnostic and therapeutic development. The proposal addresses 2 objectives: i) identification of candidate targets to guide novel therapy; and ii) development of non-invasive strategies to maximize early detection of LN. The former will be approached by identifying unique patterns from single-cell RNAseq (including RNA deregulation or mutation/allelic variation) in LN kidney cells (including capillary endothelial cells) compared with normal tissue/cells, and the latter by similar RNA analysis in LN matched with nonlesional skin, PBMC, and urine cellular pellet (UCP). Operationally the project is approached in sequential phases: Aim 1 (Phase 0, UH2): To establish the optimal method of renal tissue collection and single cell isolation of resident and infiltrating cells followed by poyA RNAseq, and similar application to cell populations present in nonlesional skin, PBMC, and UCP. Aim 2 (Phase I, UH2): To identify RNAseq patterns associated with different biopsy classes and compare with nonlesional skin (endothelial cells), PBMC, and UCP from the same patient. Aim 3 (Phase II, UH3): To establish whether a) the renal tissue RNAseq pattern associates with biopsy class, activity, and chronicity segregated by race/ethnicity; b) renal pattern tracks response to therapy and/or progression of renal disease in new onset or recurrent disease; and c) the pattern in skin, PBMC or UCP antedates new or relapsing kidney involvement."
"9310447","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application responds to FOA PA-14-046, Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award (Parent K08), which provides support and protected time to individuals with a clinical doctoral degree for an intensive, supervised research career development experience in the fields of biomedical and behavioral research, including translational research. The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of co-existing conditions including obesity and diabetes, important risk factors for chroni kidney disease and cardiovascular morbidity. Coexisting MetS and renal artery stenosis (MetS+RAS) intensify inflammation and lead to chronic kidney disease, underscoring the need for effective interventions to attenuate inflammation in the post-stenotic kidney. Our preliminary data suggest that treatment with mitochondria-targeted peptides decreases tissue damage and improves renal function in the swine stenotic-kidney, but whether mitoprotection rescues kidney function in a pre-clinical large animal model of MetS+RAS remains unknown. The hypothesis underlying this proposal is that superimposed MetS induces mitochondrial injury and exacerbates it in the stenotic RAS kidney. Hence, mitoprotection would attenuate renal structural and functional impairment that MetS magnifies in the stenotic-kidney, such as apoptosis, fibrosis, oxidative stress, and vascular loss. To test this hypothesis we will take advantage of a novel swine model of MetS with and without RAS that we recently developed that specifically mimics the disease. We will also take advantage of unique physiological imaging techniques to study single-kidney function and structure in-vivo and ex-vivo. Three specific aims will be pursued: Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that MetS induces progressive renal mitochondrial damage and dysfunction. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that MetS exacerbates renal mitochondrial dysfunction in RAS. Specific Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that mitoprotection preserves renal structure and function in MetS+RAS. The proposed studies could allow rational development of adequate treatment strategies to ameliorate renal dysfunction in patients with MetS+RAS. This proposal is well aligned with the applicant's career goals and will provide him with unique skills from theoretical and experimental knowledge to technical proficiency required for his future independent career."
"9208827","SUMMARY The Administrative Core A of this Program Project is designed to provide scientific leadership, effective communication and an administrative support structure to ensure the coordination of all Program Project activities. In 2015, the four PIs of this multiple PI P01 proposal reported in Nature that hypofractionated radiation and dual checkpoint blockade activated anti-tumor T cell immunity in both mice and patients via non-redundant mechanisms, explaining the apparent synergy. This newly proposed Program Project seeks to deeply extend our knowledge regarding the intersection of radiation and immunotherapy of cancer. The proposed program has three projects and three cores, with a balance of senior leaders in multiple disciplines working alongside more junior faculty investigators as a team. We have taken advantage of the large and efficient administrative staff and the centralized research organizations at the Abramson Cancer Center (ACC) of the University of Pennsylvania to achieve our objectives. Strong institutional commitment from the ACC and Penn has helped lay the foundation for our scientific and translational achievements. The essential services provided by the Core A include: administrative support for all of the investigators in each project and core; fiscal management and oversight for all components of the Program Project; and organization and communication of all Program Project meetings and activities. The overall goal of this Core is effective and efficient leadership of the P01. The roles of the Core Director, Co-Director and administrative staff are to facilitate communication while stimulating scientific and technological interactions. In order to achieve this goal, the Core has established three objectives: (1) Establish and maintain an administrative structure to provide support for and management of all Program Project activities, (2) Foster an environment to maximize collaborative research among Program Project investigators and between other P01 and NCI initiatives, and (3) Ensure compliance with all institutional, governmental and NCI regulations and policies."
"9212008","The Metabolomics Core (B) is comprised of a Biosafety Level 3 suite for handling infectious samples,  massively parallel detection of mycobacterial metabolites using Time of Flight mass spectrometry (Agilent  Accurate Mass ToF 6230), specialized resources for identifying known mycobacterial compounds, and  analytical capabilities to discover previously unknown compounds (Agilent Accurate Mass 6520, QTof,  Thermo LXQ Advantage 2 Dimensional Ion Trap with MSn). The integrated technologies were assembled by  the Moody laboratory and supported a Biomarker Discover Initiative of the Broad Institute, NIH U19 and ROl  Projects. Dataflow involves receipt of mycobacteria (Project 3) or patient samples (Project 4), from which  total metabolites are extracted and sterilized in organic solvents. Tissue or mycobacterial extracts enter into  a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry system, which was specifically designed to broadly detect the  highly diverse and hydrophobic compounds in mycobacteria. In the first phase of whole organism analysis,  the platform rapidly detects triplicate intensity values for ~10,000 distinct compounds in each sample. By  aligning large datasets derived from different patients, clinical isolates or genetically engineered bacteria, in-house-designed software pipeline identifies all compounds that are changed at statistically significant levels.  In a second, targeted phase, all changed compounds are ranked by biological or quantitative criteria to  define compounds of interest, whose structures are solved by comparing their masses to the literature  (MycoMass) and in-house (MycoMap) databases or are solved through collisional mass spectrometry. This  system has discovered previously unknown compounds, identified strain-specific mycobacterial biomarkers  in vitro and from tissues and identified lipids changed after gene deletion. This overview describes  expansion of the substantial existing core facilities, including a new generation of high accuracy mass  spectrometry and expansion of mycobacterial databases, as well as use of the Core to discover biomarkers  in drug-resistant or latent mycobacteria or biomarkers of infection."

"9371025","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dr. Teresa M. Lee, MD, MS is a Pediatric Cardiologist, Clinical Geneticist, and Assistant Professor of Pediatrics on the investigator track with 75% protected research time at Columbia University Medical Center. With her training and expertise, she has the highly sought-after set of skills needed to bridge the fields of genetics and cardiology to fill an important niche in translational molecular genetic cardiology research. Her current investigative efforts are directed towards identifying the genetic causes of infantile cardiomyopathy ? a research goal in line with the mission of the NHLBI to stimulate discoveries about the causes of disease that can enable the translation of basic discoveries into clinical practice. Cardiomyopathy is a disease of the heart muscle which often results in heart failure, cardiac transplantation, or death. Infants have the worst prognosis, the highest genetic causality, and the least known about the underlying cause of their disease. In particular, congenital forms of cardiomyopathy progress rapidly and are often fatal. Many of these disorders are related to alterations in the RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. In preliminary studies, Dr. Lee has identified a novel MRAS variant believed to cause the protein to be constitutively active ? leading to the development of cardiac hypertrophy via the RAS signaling pathway. She hypothesizes that infants with cardiomyopathy frequently have highly pathogenic de novo variants as the cause of their cardiomyopathy, and that the RAS signaling pathway is commonly involved in disease pathogenesis. The specific goals of this K23 proposal are to test this central hypothesis through novel gene discovery studies and the development of cellular and mouse models to study the effects of MRAS. Results from this study will impact knowledge about the genetic etiology of infantile cardiomyopathy, their underlying pathophysiology, and common pathways which can serve as future targets for pharmacologic and therapeutic intervention in the broader field of cardiomyopathy. Moreover, it serves to provide Dr. Lee with the necessary training to become an independent physician-scientist with a career focused on collaborative, patient-oriented research centered on understanding the genetic causes of cardiomyopathy in infants and children. Superb mentorship, access to abundant resources, unrivaled access to the largest and most diverse patient population, and the rich intellectual environment across Departments and Schools at Columbia University will help this candidate be well-positioned to establish an independent, life-long career focused on pediatric cardiomyopathy research that will address the inadequacies of our current treatment strategies and outcomes."

"8112385","Specific components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulate in atherosclerosis and promote  the inflammatory phase of vascular disease. We have focused on two of these components,  hyaluronan and versican, which interact with each other to form higher ordered molecular  complexes and not only contribute to ECM expansion during the development of vascular disease  but also have a dramatic effect influencing the phenotype of arterial smooth muscle cells. Recently,  we found that an ECM enriched in hyaluronan and versican promotes the adhesion of monocytes in  a hyaluronan dependent manner suggesting that these specific ECM components may form part of  what could be considered a pro-inflammatory ECM. These observations have led us to hypothesize  that hyaluronan and versican are produced by vascular cells in response to specific inflammatory  stimuli and contribute to the formation of an ECM that binds monocytes. We further hypothesize  that monocyte/macrophage also synthesize these ECM components in response to inflammatory  stimuli and degrade hyaluronan and versican and that a balance between these two activities  partially regulates the phenotype of the monocyte/macrophage. To test this hypothesis, we will  have 4 specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will identify the full nature of this specialized ECM and test the  requirements for these components for these components in hyaluronan-dependent monocyte  adhesion. In Aim 2, we will explore the role that hyperlipidemia and modified lipids play in the  generation of this ECM and define the changes in versican and hyaluronan during the development  of atherosclerosis. Aim 3 will focus on the synthesis and degradation of versican and hyaluronan  by the monocyte/macrophage and the impact of these ECM components monocyte/macrophage  proliferation, adhesion and migration.

It has been an integral component of the Ph.D. program at the Heller School since the training grant's beginning in 1995. This program in health services research specifically focuses on how organization, management, and financing make a difference in the effective delivery of health services. In this competitive renewal, the successful leadership and program structure and content of the current AHRQ multi-disciplinary training program is maintained. The same number of pre-doctoral training slots for the next five year cycle is requested. Three new students enter the program each year and are typically supported for three years. Average time to completion is 5 years with nearly 100% success rates. The AHRQ health services research training program at the Heller School embeds trainees in a rich interdisciplinary environment, with opportunities for collaborations beyond traditional health services research, such as behavioral health or assets and inequality. Doctoral educational goals focus on the intersection of three domains: theory, applied research and policy. The training programs add to this intensive discipline- based mentoring, and hands-on research experience throughout the delivery system, including hospitals, multi- specialty group practices, nursing home and community based organizations. Trainees are offered a unique education at the forefront of health policy and health organizational research, focusing on the design and financing of a patient centered delivery system. They are trained to disseminate cutting-edge knowledge to policy-makers, clinicians, provider organizations and managers. The progress and commitment of the current and former trainees of the Heller AHRQ Doctoral Training Program provide evidence for the success of this approach to doctoral training as we continue on a strong trajectory."
"9304212","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The TSC/mTORC1 signaling axis is dysregulated in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Everolimus, a rapamycin analog that partially inhibits mTORC1, is approved for the treatment of renal angiomyolipomas in TSC patients, but responses are not complete and regrowth begins after treatment discontinuation. microRNA (miRNA, miRs), which post-transcriptionally repress gene expression, have been shown to play a critical role in numerous disease processes; however, the role of miRNA in TSC and TSC therapeutic responses represents a key knowledge gap. In recently published work, we discovered a set of rapamycin-dependent miRNA, or Rapa-miRs. The unexpected finding that rapamycin upregulates pro-survival oncogenic miRNA, particularly miR-21, underlies our central hypothesis: inhibition of miRNA-dependent survival networks will enhance effectiveness of mTORC1 inhibition in angiomyolipoma therapy, leading to more complete and durable clinical responses. This hypothesis will be tested in three Specific Aims: Aim 1: To identify the regulatory mechanisms that lead to induction of miRNA by rapamycin. Aim 2: To identify biologically active rapamycin-dependent target genes of miR-21 in TSC2- deficient cells. Aim 3: To determine how the induction of miR-21 by rapamycin impacts the growth and survival of TSC2-deficient cells."
"9314609","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal seeks continuation funding for the Integrated Health Interview Series (IHIS), the nation's most comprehensive source for data and metadata describing the health of the U.S. population. The continuation will expand and enrich IHIS by adding the Household Component of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), the most complete source of information on population healthcare use and expenditures. This initiative comes at a critical time. The U.S. healthcare system is undergoing unprecedented changes in response to the Affordable Care Act. New efforts promise to transform the healthcare system away from a clinical acute care model to a population-based focus on improved health. The IHIS data system will allow scientists and policy researchers to easily access the data needed to study change and to make informed decisions. Over the past ten years, the IHIS project has successfully harmonized 50 years of NHIS data, including 5.5 million person records and over 12,000 variables describing the health and health behaviors of the U.S. population, and made these data freely available via a user-friendly web application. Adding MEPS data to IHIS and updating the web access system will greatly multiply the power of this critical piece of health data infrastructure. The content of MEPS is complimentary to that of the NHIS; MEPS collects detailed information on individual healthcare use and costs, allowing researchers to estimate average U.S. per capita healthcare spending and study expenditures by medical condition and type of healthcare service. The MEPS data are longitudinal and linkable to the NHIS; a subsample of households responding to the previous year's NHIS is selected to participate in the MEPS and is interviewed five times over a two-year period. The expanded IHIS database will add 22 years of health expenditure microdata (1996-2018), providing longitudinal data on health and healthcare for approximately 520,000 NHIS respondents, and 5 years of NHIS microdata (2014-2019). This continuation project will develop new access tools to capitalize on the longitudinal dimension of the MEPS, build linkages across the two surveys, and create more than 2,000 integrated variables. Accomplishing this goal will require restructuring the MEPS data into a consistent format, creating comprehensive machine- readable documentation of each MEPS file, and developing harmonized metadata describing the relationship between files. The expanded and upgraded IHIS will provide an invaluable on-line data resource that will reduce barriers to research on the health of the U.S. population and the use and costs of healthcare services at a critical point in the history of American healthcare."

"9316593","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A high-fructose diet is linked to the epidemic of hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Up to 25 million Americans consume up to 20% of their calories from added fructose1, 2. We found that feeding rats a fructose-enriched diet (20%) for 4 weeks did not increase blood pressure. However, a fructose-enriched diet combined with high salt (4% Na) caused salt-sensitive hypertension within 1 week (Figures 1, 11); prior to the development of metabolic abnormalities. The initial phase of salt-sensitive hypertension is in part mediated by a renal defect that prevents NaCl excretion during high salt intake. The thick ascending limb (TAL) reabsorbs 25% of filtered NaCl. Enhanced TAL NaCl absorption is related to salt-sensitive hypertension in humans and rodents3-5. However, the mechanism by which a fructose-enriched diet rapidly (1 week) causes salt-sensitive hypertension is not clear and the role of TAL NaCl absorption in this process is completely unknown. NaCl reabsorption by the TAL depends on the apical Na/K/2Cl cotransporter NKCC2, the target of loop diuretics. Our preliminary data show that a fructose-enriched diet enhanced NKCC2 phosphorylation at Threonine (Thr) 96,101. NKCC2 phosphorylation at Thr96, 101 activates NKCC26, 7. Our data show that NKCC2-mediated NaCl transport is abnormally elevated in rats fed fructose plus a high salt diet. However, the effects of fructose and the signaling induced in the TAL and the distal nephron have not been studied. Our data show that plasma and urine fructose increase rapidly after fructose intake. Thus, fructose reaching the nephron may be transported in by a fructose channel, activating protein kinase signaling. The only kinases known to phosphorylate Thr96, 101 of NKCC2 are SPAK (STE20/SPS1-related proline-alanine-rich kinase) and OSR1 (Oxidative Stress Responsive 1) kinases. In the TAL, these kinases specifically phosphorylate NKCC2. In the distal convoluted tubule (DCT), these kinases specifically phosphorylate the thiazide-sensitive NaCl transporter NCC. We found that a 20% fructose diet increases SPAK/OSR1 phosphorylation in TALs. In addition, stimulation of ?-adrenergic receptors (?-AR) in the TAL activates NKCC213. A fructose-enriched diet may increase sympathetic activity by 2 weeks12, or enhance the sensitivity or signaling of ?-AR. Our preliminary data show that ?-AR stimulation increases SPAK/OSR1 phosphorylation in TALs. In the Dahl salt sensitive (SS) rat, NKCC2 and SPAK/OSR1 phosphorylation are abnormally enhanced in a normal salt diet. It is not known whether this increases the effect of fructose on blood pressure and NaCl absorption. We hypothesize that a fructose-enriched diet enhances thick ascending limb (TAL) and distal tubule (DCT) NaCl absorption by inducing NKCC2 and NCC phosphorylation via SPAK/OSR1 kinases and enhanced ?-AR signaling. These effects occur within 1 week, prior to metabolic alterations, and are maintained chronically (16 weeks), promoting salt-sensitive hypertension in normal rats. In Dahl SS rats, abnormally elevated SPAK/OSR1 in the TAL, enhances the effect of fructose on blood pressure in normal- or high-salt diets."

"9272274","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking among women is a substantial U.S. public health problem that is highly associated with socioeconomic status, especially low educational attainment. It is also a direct contributor to health disparities. For example, smoking prevalence in the U.S. exceeds 30 percent among women with < 12 years of education compared to less than 6 percent for women with graduate degrees. Smoking prevalence among disadvantaged mothers is at strikingly high levels (40-60 percent). Disadvantaged women begin smoking at an earlier age, are heavier smokers, and are more likely to be nicotine dependent and to fail at smoking cessation. Not surprisingly, disadvantaged women are also at increased risk for smoking-related adverse health outcomes, including adversely impacting the health of their children through in-utero and second-hand smoke exposure (SHSe). Despite widespread awareness of the adverse health consequences of SHSe, almost 85 percent of U.S. children from low-income families are chronically exposed. SHSe, especially from maternal smoking, increases risk for infant death, chronic respiratory infections, asthma, and other longer-term medical problems, and is estimated to increase direct medical and life-lost costs in the U.S. by > $5 billion annually. Efficacious interventions to increase maternal smoking cessation and reduce childhood SHSe are sorely needed. In this application we are proposing to test the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of an intervention for promoting smoking-cessation among economically disadvantaged mothers of young children (< 11 yrs) that is based in the conceptual framework of behavioral economics and uses financial incentives to motivate behavior change. We are proposing to conduct a randomized controlled clinical trial comparing (1) usual care for smoking cessation and reducing SHSe among children, (2) usual care combined with financial incentives for objectively verified smoking abstinence and (3) usual care combined with financial incentives and also with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) using innovative procedures to enhance medication efficacy. We hypothesize that both interventions involving financial incentives will increase biochemically-verified smoking abstinence in mothers and decrease SHSe in their children, but that the largest and most cost-effective treatment effects will be achieved by combining financial incentives with NRT. Behavioral-economic measures of decision-making biases and cigarette-price sensitivity will be examined as predictors of treatment response. Overall, the proposed study has the potential to advance knowledge on efficacious, cost-effective smoking cessation for maternal smokers and protection against SHSe in children. The study also has the potential to impact policies and clinical practices regarding recommended care for combating chronic SHSe in disadvantaged children."
"9441625","Project Summary Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disease, and currently there is no effective means of preventing or slowing joint degeneration. However, growth factors and cytokines are strongly implicated in initiating and aggravating OA lesions. Thus, a molecular understanding of the interplay among these molecules will provide invaluable information toward the search for novel therapeutic targets for OA. Our genome-wide screen for dif ferentially expressed genes in OA led to the isolation of progranulin (PGRN) as an OA-associated growth factor, and genetic screen for PGRN binding partners led to the isolation of TNFR as the PGRN-binding receptor (Tang, Science, 2011). We have developed an engineered protein named Atsttrin which is composed of three TNFR-binding domains of PGRN, and Atsttrin surpassed PGRN in treating inflammatory arthritis. During the initial funding period, we have successfully identified 14-3-3?, an important intracellular signaling molecule, as a novel component of TNFR2 complexes in response to PGRN stimulation in a proteomics screen. In addition, knockout of 14-3-3? in chondrocytes abolished PGRN's signaling. Further, we recently isolated DR3, the highest homology to TNFR1, as a novel additional TNFR member that binds to PGRN/Atsttrin, and PGRN/Atsttrin disturbed the interaction between DR3 and TNF-like ligand 1A (TL1A). Thus, this competitive continued application is primarily based on 1) the identification of 14-3-3? as a novel component of PGRN/TNFR2 pathway, and 2) the isolation of DR3 as a novel additional PGRN-binding receptor. The central hypothesis of this renewal is that PGRN exerts its chondroprotective role in the pathogenesis of OA through its a) recruitment of 14-3-3? to TNFR2 and activation of the PGRN/TNFR2 anabolic pathway; and b) interplay with and inhibition of TNF?/TNFR1 and TL1A/DR3 inflammatory/catabolic pathways. The Specific Aims are: (1) What are the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways by which PGRN and Atsttrin regulate chondrocyte metabolism? We will determine the effects of PGRN, Atsttrin, TNF? and TL1A on chondrocyte metabolism, their signaling pathways, target gene expression profiling and interplay in chondrocytes (SA#1A); whether PGRN and Atsttrin signaling and target gene expressions depends on 14-3-3? in chondrocytes (SA#1B); and whether the PGRN/Atsttrin regulates chondrocytes through modulating TL-1A/DR3 pathway as well (SA#1C). (2) Does PGRN/Atsttrin have therapeutic and protective role in OA, and what are the mechanisms of its action in OA? We will determine whether recombinant Atsttrin, similar to PGRN, reverses the susceptibility of PGRN-/- mice to OA challenge, and whether PGRN and Atsttrin ameliorate existing OA(SA#2A); whether chondrocyte- expressed 14-3-3? is important for PGRN/Atsttrin's role in OA(SA#2B); and whether DR3 pathway also contributes to PGRN/Atsttrin's protective role in OA (SA#2C). Completion of the proposed research will not only elucidate the importance of 14-3-3? and DR3 in PGRN-mediated regulation of chondrocytes and OA, but may also lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for treating OA and other degenerative diseases."
"8106989","Project 1 hypothesizes that Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) rats when fed a high salt diet will reabsorb greater  than normal amounts of NaCI in the renal medullary thick ascending limb (mTAL) that in turn will stimulate  excess production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and thereby reduce medullary blood flow (MBF). The  mTAL of SS rats express greater amounts of Na/K/2CI co-transporter than salt-insensitive control SS.13 rats  and it will be determined if they also express greater amounts of isoforms of the Na/H exchanger (NHE) that  could account for excess superoxide (O*2~) production. We propose that increased luminal delivery of NaCI  together with increases of outer medullary interstitial NaCI concentration may stimulate NAD(P)H oxidase and  enhance production of O*2 and H2O2. It will be determined if greater diffusion of O'2~ and/or H2O2 occurs from  mTAL to vasa recta pericytes in the presence of reduced NO bioavailability and whether this leads to a  reduction of MBF. These events will be studied using time resolved fluorescence videomicroscopy of  medullary tissue strips. Physiological relevance of these observations will be assessed by studies in conscious  instrumented rats. Sequential measurements of medullary interstitial O'2~, H202, NO and medullary interstitial  [NaCI] will be obtained using implanted microdialysis fibers. Changes of medullary blood flow and arterial  pressure will be measured daily in these conscious rats using implanted optical fibers and laser-Doppler  techniques together with indwelling arterial catheters before and following an increase in salt (NaCI) intake and  the development of hypertension. The project is defined by three specific aims: 1) To determine if exposure of  mTAL to increased NaCI by either tubular microperfusion and/or bath superfusion results in greater mTAL  production of O*2 or H2O2 and subsequent constriction of surrounding vasa recta vessels in SS compared to  the control SS.13BN rats; 2) To explore the cellular mechanisms whereby increased luminal delivery of NaCI to  mTAL and increases of interstitial NaCI concentrations enhance 0*2 production in SS rats; 3) To characterize  the temporal responses of renal medullary production of O*2, H2O2, and NO in conscious SS rats to determine  if increases in ROS initiate reductions of medullary blood flow following increased NaCI intake."

With 147,811 residents, it is Western Colorado?s most populated county, and also acts as the region?s commerce and healthcare hub serving a population exceeding 300,000. The tourism industry continues to grow in the region (contributing more than $270 million in direct spending annually), thus the hospitality industry is an important contributor to the local economy. The Mesa County Health Department (MCHD) licenses 750 retail food establishments annually, including temporary event vendors and mobile units. Between 2010 and 2014, MCHD received 938 complaints from the community regarding retail food establishments that were followed up on by an environmental health specialist (EHS). The people who live, work, and play in Mesa County will benefit from advancing the conformance of the Voluntary National Retail Food Regulatory Program Standards (VNS), aligning inspection and training programs to address the most common practices and behaviors that lead to foodborne illness. These efforts will ensure that retail food establishments are safer for consumers, decrease the incidence of foodborne illness at area establishments, and promote the health and wellness of community members.  Requested funding will be used to meet five of the VNS standards by the end of the funding period in August 2020. At the end of the project, MCHD will have an operating structure that will have the ability to quickly identify problems and trends that can be addressed to reduce the occurrence of foodborne illness risk factors cited during inspections. Data will be used to characterize trends in the retail food industry and document the outcomes of MCHD interventions. MCHD?s vision when the proposed aims are achieved is for Mesa County to become an empowered food safe community utilizing methods, technologies, and preventative interventions that reduce foodborne illness risk factors at retail food establishments to improve community health and wellness."

"9273554","The premise of Project I is that an important subset of infants dying of SIDS have a neurobiological disorder whose elucidation requires the application of innovative quantitative tools directly in SIDS brain tissues, and for which there are potential biomarkers in readily accessible blood and/or platelets. Our key discovery to date Is that SIDS Is associated with neurotransmitter abnormalities In regions of the medulla oblongata that are critical for protective responses to homeostatic challenges during sleep. The most robust abnormalities are In serotonin (5-HT) and y-aminobutyric acid (GABA) parameters, as well as a deficiency of the 14-3-3-slgnal transduction family. These latter signaling proteins are known to play a role In central neurotransmitter and synaptic function. Including related to 5-HT. We now consider the basis of the putative medullary disorder in affected SIDS cases as a defect In a molecular Interaction network that affects 5-HT and GABA, as well as potentially other neurotransmitters as yet to be defined, and involves upstream abnormalities In 14-3-3. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine whole genome expression profiles with transcriptome analysis of the raphe obscurus (RO) and Its Isolated 5-HT neurons (laser capture microscopy) of the medullary 5-HT system in SIDS cases compared to controls. Our approach will also uncover novel candidate genes with altered gene expression in SIDS, thereby providing insight Into the complete Interaction network at fault. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine if there is a link in 5-HT and related pathology between caudal and rostral 5-HT domains of the brainstem and the key forebrain target of the rostral domain, i.e., the hippocampus. The elucidation of such a link in the same SIDS cases would reconfigure our understanding of the 5-HT related neuropathology of SIDS to a disorder broader than the brainstem only. In Specific Aim 3, we will build upon our preliminary observations that serum 5-HT levels, which are dependent In large part upon platelet 5-HT metabolism, are elevated In a subset of SIDS Infants compared to controls. Indicating an Important lead, we believe, for eariy biomarker development directly In SIDS Infants. We will apply several methodologies for analysis of postmortem serum and platelets (known to contain important 5-HT-related receptors, transporter, and enzymes) in SIDS infants compared to controls, and correlate the findings with medullary parameters In the same SIDS cases. In all alms, we will analyze the effect upon outcomes of different clinicopathologic variables. Including male gender, prematurity, exposures to maternal cigarette smoke and SSRIs, and sleep position. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The relevance of Project I to SIDS Is that It has the potential to help determine effective treatments and biomarkers in Infants at risk based upon specific abnormal molecular pathways. It may also change our formulation of a neural SIDS subset as a 5-HT disorder that involves bralnstem-forebrain interconnections. There is no other laboratory in the world that is systematically analyzing SIDS brains and/or related biomarkers, and in parallel with animal modeling, as in Project I."
"9384696","Project Summary Increased intestinal permeability plays a crucial role in a number of chronic intestinal inflammatory conditions including Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), celiac disease, as well as Crohn?s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), collectively referred to as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). More than 1.4 million Americans suffer from IBD. While the exact cause(s) of IBD are unknown, there is considerable evidence that a permeability defect in the intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) layer plays a major role in the development of IBD. The intestinal epithelial lining is a single layer of cells that forms the interface between the bacteria that reside in the intestine (intestinal microbiota), and the rest of the body. During inflammation, the epithelium is exposed to high levels of inflammatory mediators such as interferon-? (IFN?). These mediators activate signaling pathways that alter various functions of the epithelium, such as barrier maintenance. Termination of these signals is mediated largely by the activity of phosphatases. One such phosphatase, protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2), negatively regulates IFN? signaling in non-epithelial cells. However, little is known about the function of PTPN2 in the intestinal epithelium. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the PTPN2 gene have been confirmed as a genetic marker associated with Crohn?s disease, UC, T1D and celiac disease. Thus, these diseases share a common gene association and an elevation in intestinal permeability. We have identified a completely novel involvement of PTPN2 in the regulation of epithelial barrier function. Therefore, the specific objectives of this proposal are to better understand how PTPN2 loss-of-function mutations alter phosphorylation signaling networks impacting upon intestinal barrier function, and if this can be corrected by a clinically-effective therapeutic agent. This will be addressed in three specific aims. Aim 1: Determine the molecular mechanisms causing epithelial barrier defects due to PTPN2 loss of function Aim 2: PTPN2 is a negative regulator of JAK-STAT inflammatory signaling pathways. We will investigate if the JAK inhibitor, Tofacitinib can correct the consequences of PTPN2 loss of function through inhibiting JAK-STAT pathways normally restricted by PTPN2. Aim 3: Identify how loss of PTPN2 phosphatase activity alters its ?phospho- interactome? in IEC and how does this impact upon tight junction protein phosphoregulation. Expected Outcomes & Impact: These studies will not only build a more accurate mechanistic understanding of the consequences of loss-of-function PTPN2 mutations for barrier function regulation and associated signaling networks, but will also identify a possible therapeutic approach to resolve these defects."
"9309017","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has the potential to improve medical care, but much effort remains to translate sequence data into meaningful clinical interpretations. WGS interpretation must address both newly observed genetic variants that are likely to be harmful, as well as the review of over 150,000 variants that are already reported to be associated with disease from the medical and scientific literature. Many of these discoveries were made in small cohort and case studies, making it difficult to translate these into disease risks for asymptomatic individuals that carry these variants. Without accurate risk estimates for these associations, we may potentially expose healthy patients to false positive findings, leading to needless diagnostic workups and screenings that will substantially increase medical costs and patient morbidity.  Central to WGS interpretation is the development of a standardized methodology to filter likely benign results, and to prioritize those variants that may be clinically significant and scientifically valid. While many of these previously identified variats are associated with Mendelian disorders that are individually rare, (e.g. hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and neurofibromatosis,) these disorders are collectively common, forming a long tail that confers disease risk for many individuals. Because each of these diseases is so rare, it is hard to envision a specialized interpretive approach to calculate risk for each disease so we propose a systematic approach that is broadly applicable across many rare diseases to assess variant disease risk.  To meet this urgent need, we will develop a novel approach that estimates the penetrance of disease- associated variants using the prior probability of each disease, and the population frequencies of all of the known genetic variants for that disease for affected and unaffected individuals. This prior probability of disease is measured as the prevalence, or the proportion of individuals in a population affected with a disorder. Because the prevalence of a Mendelian disease is actually a combination of the penetrance and frequency of all of its genetic variation (as well as other behavioral and environmental factors) we propose to estimate these penetrance values using the disease prevalence and distribution of associated variation, for each disease. If there is only one variant associated with a disease, the total penetrance and population frequency for that disease should be closely correlated with disease prevalence, but if there are many disease-associated variants, each contributes less to the overall burden of diseases, adjusted by its frequency in the population. We will then use these penetrance estimates to establish genome-wide filtering cutoffs for likely benign variation and to prioritize observed WGS variation for review by clinical geneticists. We then propose to use these values to filter and rank the observed variation in individual WGS datasets in an existing clinical trial, and to compare these with existing clinical genetics interpretations."
"9208830","Project Summary Immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment of a variety of advanced cancers, especially immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Although newly FDA approved antibodies that block CTLA-4 or PD-1 offer hope for some patients, not all patients respond, and others relapse after initial response. Consequently, there is a great importance in evaluating immune checkpoint blockade with other therapies that trigger immune activation. Based on extensive preclinical and clinical results from our group, we are focused on the combination of immune checkpoint blockade with hypofractionated radiotherapy (HFRT). The rationale for this approach is emerging evidence from our group and others that irradiation of tumors can stimulate the immune system, perhaps by releasing tumor-associated antigens which may allow for better response to the immunomodulatory agents. In a previous phase I trial of ipilimumab with HFRT in patients with advanced melanoma, we observed some cases of deep objective responses, reminiscent of prior case reports, but only in 18% of patients. In extensive preclinical experiments in which we modeled the interactions of radiation and ICB, we found across multiple histologies (breast and pancreatic cancer, melanoma) that blockade of CTLA-4 and PDL-1/PD- 1 in combination with HFRT achieved major tumor regressions and complete responses in mice without major toxicity (Tyman-Saint Victor, Nature, 2015). Both CTLA-4 and PD-L1 blockade are required for optimal therapy as each modality non-redundantly improves response and immunity. PD-L1 blockade is especially important to overcome immune resistance, as our data show that efficacy of HFRT plus CTLA-4 blockade alone is limited by PD-L1 expression in the tumor, a finding validated in samples from our initial trial. Based on these pre-clinical data, we propose two immediate clinical trials in collaboration with Core C combining agents that block CTLA-4 (ipilimumab or tremelimumab) or PD- 1/PD-L1 (nivolumab or durvalumab) with HFRT: (Aim 1) a phase 2 randomized trial of ipilimumab and nivolumab with or without HFRT in patients with metastatic melanoma, and (Aim 2) a phase 1 trial of tremelimumab and durvalumab in patients with metastatic pancreatic, lung, and breast cancer. In Aim 3, we will apply a comprehensive plan for immune assessment with collaborations across all Projects and Cores in this P01 to determine the immunological mechanisms of our approach. The expected clinical and immunological findings will significantly advance the development radiation and immune checkpoint therapy for patients. 1"
"9495217","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): VITAL-DEP (Depression Endpoint Prevention in the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL) is an ongoing, large- scale, 2x2 factorial randomized trial of vitamin D (vitamin D3 [cholecalciferol] 2000 IU/d) and omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA, in 1:1 ratio, 1000 mg/d) for the prevention of late-life depression and promotion of long- term benefits for mood. In the first funding period (9/29/10-06/30/15), we completed baseline and early follow- up of depression outcomes among nearly 19,000 successfully randomized men and women, aged 50+ years (mean age=65y), who were eligible for incidence or recurrence of late-life depression; nearly 70% of participants have provided pre-randomization blood samples for nutrient biochemical assays. Furthermore, in the Clinical and Translational Science Center (CTSC) component, detailed phenotypic assessments were conducted among a subset of over 1,000 individuals who received in-person structured psychiatric diagnostic interviews, underwent neuropsychological testing, and provided data on dimensional measures of mood, well- being, and social and daily functioning. Finally, another landmark aspect of VITAL-DEP is its substantial racial and ethnic diversity: over 25% of participants are from minority racial and/or ethnic backgrounds, including 19% who are African American. Indeed, our first funding period aims emphasized potential differences in vitamin D response among African Americans, given high risk of low 25(OH)D in this group. However, late- breaking evidence indicates that bioavailable vitamin D is of greatest relevance to race/ethnic differences. In this 5-year renewal proposal, we expand upon what has been achieved in the first period - assembly of a unique trial cohort - and focus on the unprecedented scientific opportunities afforded by this RCT design. Our Primary Aims are: 1) to extend follow-up of mood to examine with high statistical power the long-term (up to 7 years) effects of vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty acids on depression outcomes among all ~19,000 participants; 2) to examine with high power the impact of biochemical nutrients levels of vitamin D and omega- 3 fatty acids on depression outcomes as well as treatment interaction with baseline biochemical levels. Secondary Aims focus on two critical themes that our particular trial design is uniquely poised to address: 1) racial/ethnic differences in long-term treatment effects; 2) mechanisms, mediators and moderators of mood effects of vitamin D and fish oil in this diverse cohort. Specifically, in a sub-set of 2,000 participants, we will examine relations of bioavailable vitamin D to depression, with attention to race differences in outcomes. Further, among the entire eligible CTSC cohort, we will obtain pre- and post-randomization serum brain- derived neurotrophic factor and targeted plasma metabolite levels to examine biological paths involved in mood responses to vitamin D and fish oil treatment and to test whether biomarker change explains variation in treatment effects. Thus, this proposal not only will ensure comprehensive, definitive testing of the benefits of vitamin D and fish oil for late-life mood but also will inform specific mechanisms involved in a diverse sample."
"9317537","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neostriatum is the main input structure of the basal ganglia, a system that is crucial not only for voluntary motor control, but also for reinforcement-mediated learning and higher cognitive functions. The importance of understanding the functioning of the nesotriatum is dramatically illustrated by the severe disability associated with numerous neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions that affect this brain structure.  Developments in transgenic methods that allow visualization and targeting of genetically and functionally distinct types of neurons has recently led to the discovery of an unexpectedly large diversity of  GABAergic interneurons in the neostriatum. As a result the striatum is now known to contain at least 7 types of GABAergic interneurons that include, in addition to the previously known fast spiking (FS) and the NPY expressing NPY-PLTS interneurons, 4 distinct classes of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) containing interneurons and a new class of NPY expressing interneuron. We hypothesize, based on preliminary data and earlier studies, that the newly discovered TH and NPY interneurons are integral and important constituents of a highly organized intrastriatal synaptic circuitry and play essential roles in determining the activity and computational function of the neostriatum. The goal of the proposed studies is to understand the synaptic organization of this circuitry and to assess the functional significance of the newly discovered interneuron classes in determining the activity of other constituent neurons, in particular, the activity of functionally distinct types of projection neuros. The circuit organization of TH and NPY interneurons will be mapped in in vitro optogenetic experiments using a series of double transgenic mice in which expression of Cre-recombinase and EGFP in  distinct types of neurons will allow high-throughput bidirectional analysis of the connectivity among TH, NPY,  and FS interneurons and projection neurons of the direct and indirect pathways.  The functional impact of TH and NPY interneurons will be assessed in in vivo optogenetic recording experiments in mice trained to perform operant tasks. First, we will examine how the firing rate of these interneurons varies in relation to distinct phases of the operant tasks. Next, we will examine how optogenetic  manipulation (silencing or activation) of the activity of TH and NPY interneurons affects the firing rate of  projection neurons, cholinergic and FS interneurons, how these manipulations affect local field potential oscillations, and how qualitative or quantitative measures of behavioral performance are affected.  These experiments are expected to yield important new insights into the functioning of the neostriatum  and may help to identify new cellular substrates for therapeutic interventions in a variety of neurological and  neuropsychiatric disorders."

"8112382","Osteopontin (OPN) is a multifunctional, secreted phosphoprotein with beneficial anticalcific effects  on pathological calcification. Recent data suggest that OPN may also play a critical role in  development of various chronic inflammatory diseases, including atherosclerosis. Furthermore,  growing evidence indicates that multiple, proteolytically processed forms of OPN are generated  under inflammatory conditions. However, virtually nothing is known about the specific form(s) and  function(s) of OPN important in these settings. We propose that a common feature of chronic  inflammatory conditions is a requirement for OPN function in macrophages. Specifically, we  hypothesize that 1) OPN mediates macrophage recruitment, activation, and survival in  atherosclerotic plaques, 2) thrombin, as well as matrix metalloproteases secreted by inflammatory  cells modify OPN activity, and 3) that specific OPN proteolytic fragments are required for plaque  progression in vivo. Three Specific Aims are proposed to address these hypotheses. In Specific  Aim 1, the role of macrophage- and lymphocyte-derived OPN in atherosclerotic lesion initiation and  progression in chow-fed ApoE-/- mice will be determined using bone marrow transplant studies. In  Specific Aim 2, the role of OPN and its receptors in the modulation of macrophage functions in vitro,  including adhesion, migration, survival and activation, will be examined. Finally, in Specific Aim 3,  the role of two integrin binding domains, RGD and SLAYGLR domains, of OPN as well as MMPderived  OPN proteolytic fragments will be determined during atherosclerotic lesion development  and progression in ApoE-/- mice using bone marrow over-expressing these OPN fragments on a  macrophage specific promoter. Understanding differences in the mechanisms and  structure/function relationships governing inflammatory properties of OPN could help create specific  therapeutics targeting these distinct functions."
"9310033","Abstract The Cerro Gordo County Department of Public Health (Health Department) operates a retail food regulatory program focused on the reduction of risk factors known to cause or contribute to foodborne illness. The Health Department centers on active managerial control and is working on the Voluntary National Retail Food Regulatory Program Standards (Standards). To date, the Health Department has conformed to four of the nine Standards. This funding opportunity provides a platform to achieve greater conformance with the Standards and to implement innovative intervention strategies to reduce occurrence of contributing risk factors. The project's goal is to develop, implement and continuously improve the infrastructure and effectiveness of the Cerro Gordo County Department of Public Health's retail food safety program using the Standards to ensure food safety. Two aims were developed to achieve the goal. Aim 1 is by August 2017, the Cerro Gordo County Department of Public Health will increase their Standard achievement to 100% compliant. Health Department staff developed an action plan for success in compliance with Standards 1, 5, 6, 8 and 9. Highlighted activities include hiring a food inspector to reduce the inspections to staff ratio, gaining equipment to improve inspection quality, implementing quality assurance activities (i.e. sampling files for compliance review), updating the inspections database and conducting a facility study. As each Standard is approved by the verifying agency, it, along with already achieved Standards, will cycle to promote continuous program improvement. Aim 2 is that by August 2020, Health Department staff through Standards quality improvement will achieve a 15% decrease in risk-factor violations. Three branches of innovation will aid in reduction. First, is implementation of the Olmstead County, Minnesota, Procedures, Training, Verification electronic assessment system. It provides a platform for communication and education with retail food operators and prioritizes a system for follow-up and consultation. The system is active managerial control that determines whether a facility is in control of their risk factors. The second category is embedding food safety courses in the community thereby flooding the area with certified food handlers. Staff will work with community organizations, retail food facilities and individuals to increase course offerings. Third, is a category that will transform the existing Food Safety Manual to oral culture to better educate food workers. This project will help the Health Department meet their mission to optimize the health of all people in Cerro Gordo County."
"9395319","ABSTRACT Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of liver malignancy, is one of the most lethal forms of cancer. HCC is not diagnosed until late stages and has a poor 5-year survival rate of less than 14%. Excluding liver transplantation, the current standard of care for HCC is treatment with sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor that targets Raf, receptor tyrosine kinases, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor, which extends median survival time from 7.9 months to 10.7 months. This modest gain emphasizes the urgent need to identify new and effective therapeutic targets for HCC. Genome wide analyses such as the ENCODE (ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements) project have revealed that most of the genome is transcribed, even though less than 2% of the genome encodes for proteins. Thousands of transcripts greater than 200 nucleotides in length, called long non- coding RNAs (lncRNAs), are expressed in a tissue-specific manner and undergo changes in expression level during cellular differentiation and in cancers. LncRNAs have been implicated in numerous molecular functions including modulating transcriptional patterns, regulating protein activities, serving structural or organizational roles, altering RNA processing events, and serving as precursors to small RNAs. One lncRNA (lnc05) is of particular interest in that it is enriched in mouse hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines and it is conserved in human. In preliminary studies, I have found that lnc05 is up-regulated in HCC cells compared to normal mouse hepatocytes as well as human HCC and cirrhotic liver tissue samples. Knock-out of lnc05 in HepA1-6 cells increases the doubling time by 23%, and modulates the fraction of cells in S and G2 phases. Moreover, knock- down of lnc05 expression using anti-sense oligonucleotides (ASOs) decreases proliferation, as assessed by expression levels of Ki67, a proliferation marker, and colony formation assays. The objective of the proposed studies is to characterize lnc05 and its potential role in HCC. I propose to conduct a thorough molecular characterization of this novel lncRNA including determining its size, isoform diversity, and sub-cellular localization, as well as perform loss-of and gain-of-function studies using approaches such as knock-out (CRISPR/Cas9), knock-down using ASOs, and overexpression of the transcript. In addition, identification of interacting partners by pull-down and mass spectrometry will expand our understanding of its function. I will also employ mouse models of HCC that closely mimic the biogenesis and genetics of human HCC to determine the in vivo impact of this lncRNA on proliferation and growth. Finally, I will test our ASOs on human HCC cell lines to determine the impact of lnc05 depletion on growth. Together, these studies will result in comprehensive insights into the function of lnc05, as well as test the effect of knocking down lnc05 using ASOs in the context of mouse models of HCC and human tumor cells."
"9328551","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. Mammalian cells possess immune defenses that act immediately to hinder the progression of pathogenic viral infection. In recent years, the Cristea laboratory and others have discovered that human cells can distinguish viral DNA from human DNA in the nuclei of infected cells. This finding was in contrast to the previous belief that sensing of viral DNA takes place only in subcellular compartments that lack human DNA (e.g., cytoplasm), and has provided an important new avenue of research for understanding cellular defense against nuclear-replicating DNA viruses. The principal discovery was the characterization of the interferon inducible protein IFI16 as a nuclear sensor of viral DNA and a crucial effector of intrinsic and innate immunity against nuclear-replicating herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). Our studies during infection with HSV-1 and HCMV have indicated that IFI16 binds viral double-stranded DNA in the nucleus through its HIN200 domains, oligomerizes through its pyrin domain, and activates the central cytoplasmic signaling axis, STING-TBK1-IRF3, to induce antiviral cytokines. However, how IFI16 initiates and propagates signals from the nucleus remains unknown. The goal of this proposal is to characterize the mechanism by which nuclear IFI16-mediated immune signals are propagated to this signaling axis upon herpesvirus infection. I will use a multidisciplinary approach that integrates proteomics with molecular virology, live cell microscopy, and biochemistry to define the mechanism of cellular immune response to herpesvirus infection. Performing these experiments with both HSV-1 and HCMV will help identify a broadly-relevant and conserved mechanism through which IFI16 signals. First, given my preliminary observation that IFI16 changes its subnuclear localization upon infection to associate with promyelocytic leukemia bodies (PML-NBs), I will investigate the means through which this localization is achieved. Specifically, I will conduct immunoaffinity isolations to assess the contributions of IFI16 structural motifs to mediating the interaction between IFI16 and PML-NBs. I will then use quantitative proteomic approaches to identify changes in the SUMOylation state of IFI16 during infection. Mutational analyses, immunofluorescence microscopy, and quantitative RT-PCR will be used next to assess the contribution of SUMOylation, SUMO interaction motifs (SIMs), and IFI16 structural properties to both the localization of IFI16 to PML-NBs and the downstream induction of antiviral cytokines. Lastly, I will characterize the function of IFI16 interactions that are unique to immune signaling during early infection. My preliminary studies showed that IFI16 associates with the antiviral IFIT 1/2/3 proteins. I will use live cell microscopy, knockdown assays, and antiviral cytokine measurements to assess the nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of IFIT proteins and their contribution to the propagation of the signals to STING. Altogether, this project will help elucidate the molecular mechanisms governing immune signal transmission, which is critical for understanding cellular immunity and for developing novel antiviral therapies."
"9431366","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. The mission of the West Virginia University Injury Control Research Center (WVU ICRC) is to advance the science and practice of injury prevention and control through research, education, outreach and service. The long-term goal of the Center is to reduce the societal burden imposed by injury. We aspire to prevent injury-related mortality and morbidity, and reduce the adverse health and economic consequences associated with injury. The WVU ICRC addresses national priorities for injury control while simultaneously emphasizing topics that are most relevant to West Virginia and the surrounding Appalachian region, a region that is economically depressed and exhibits disproportionately high injury rates. As a center of excellence, the WVU ICRC is much more than a collection of individual research projects. Rather, the Center is an interdisciplinary organization that applies a comprehensive approach designed to advance the field of injury prevention and control. Accordingly, the activities proposed in this center grant application are intended to accomplish the following overarching aims:  1. To advance scientific discovery in the field of injury prevention and control, including the development  of new and effective injury prevention and control strategies;  2. To improve injury prevention and control capacity at the local, regional, and national levels;  3. To increase public awareness of the burden of injury and public support for injury prevention and  control efforts; and  4. To strengthen injury prevention and control programs and policies. To fulfill these aims, the WVU ICRC has developed four Core areas (Administrative, Outreach, Education, and Research). Each Core has established specific goals, objectives, and methods, which, collectively, comprise the cross-cutting activities of the Center. In this application we propose four new research investigations focusing on national and regional injury priorities including motor vehicle injuries, falls in the elderly, prescription drug overdoses, and suicide. The proposed research spans the spectrum of injury control including primary prevention, acute care, and public health translation. Further, we propose an expansion of our educational program and the establishment of a variety of innovative training opportunities for our students in collaboration with our many external partners. Finally, we plan to expand the impact of our Center through a series of activities designed to actively disseminate research findings, promote enhanced regional collaborations, and support community-based injury control practitioners and policymakers."
"9332148","HIV rebound after interruption of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) is generally thought to reflect the size of the persistent reservoir found in long-lived memory CD4+ T cells, with a smaller reservoir reflected in delayed rebound. However, tissue reservoirs under ART suppression have been poorly characterized, so we do not know if characteristics of those reservoirs have a dominant impact on rebound kinetics. The contribution of host immune responses to rebound kinetics is also poorly understood, especially since most available data are focused on IFN-? producing T cell responses that are not related to control of viral load in acute or chronic infection. It would be surprising if the indiscriminate total of such responses had an important impact on rebound. Project 2 will leverage unique advantages of the rhesus macaque model to understand how tissue reservoirs and host immunity impact rebound. The animal model will provide frequent longitudinal samples of tissue-resident cells and recrudescent virus throughout suppressive ART and during rebound, which will be characterized by Dr. Mario Stevenson under the auspices of Project 3. In addition, we have the unique capability in rhesus macaques to induce both Mamu-E-restricted CD8+ T cells and memory NK cells using viral IL-10-deleted RhCMV/SIV vaccines. In contrast to conventional class Ia-restricted CD8+ T cells expressing IFN-?,1,2 Mamu-E-restricted CD8+ T cells likely contribute to suppression and even elimination of virus soon after infection, when SIV is replicating quickly in T cells, many of which are confined to gut tissue. We propose that the situation in a human patient after ART withdrawal is similar to that early stage of infection, in that HIV rebound presumably begins from a small number of cells reactivating virus in restricted anatomic sites. Thus, if HLA-E-restricted responses are present in some human patients (Project 1) or can be induced in vaccinated humans or macaques, these individuals might exhibit delayed rebound. We hypothesize that the unique immune responses elicited by RhCMV/SIV therapeutic vaccination under ART, but not conventional CTL elicited by Ad/SIV vaccine when used alone, alter both tissue viral reservoirs and SIV rebound kinetics. Our specific aims are: 1. Test if therapeutic RhCMV/SIV vaccination is superior to Ad/SIV vaccination for depletion of the Tfh-resident SIV reservoir. 2. Test if RhCMV/SIV vaccination slows rebound kinetics. 3. Determine if HLA/Mamu-E-restricted T cell responses are induced in unvaccinated individuals by CMV co-infection and are a biomarker for delayed rebound."
"8112384","High density lipoprotein (HDL) plays a critical role in preventing CVD. Inflammation is of  central importance in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Chronic inflammation leads to changes  in HDL [e.g. decreased apolipoprotein A-l (apo A-l) and paraoxonase (PON1), and increased SAA  and other novel proteins identified by mass spectrometry]. These changes are associated with a  loss of its atheroprotective properties. Inflammation also may lead to pro-atherogenic changes in  HDL. We hypothesize that compositional and functional changes in HDL induced by inflammation  provides an important link between inflammation and atherosclerosis. We also hypothesize that  changes in HDL composition may be biomarkers that indicate the presence of oxidative damage  and/or atherosclerosis at the level of the artery wall. To test these hypotheses, we plan to  determine how inflammation (acute and chronic) influences HDL composition, function and role in  atherogenesis in mice. Next, we will test the mechanism by which inflammation reduces the  atheroprotective HDL apolipoproteins apo A-l and PON1, and increases the potentially proatherogenic  apolipoprotein SAA in HDL. Third, we will determine whether local over-expression by  macrophages of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory proteins present in HDL affects the initiation  and/or progression of atherosclerosis in a mouse model of hypercholesterolemia. Finally, we will  determine whether chronic inflammation alters the composition and functional properties of HDL in  humans in a manner similar to that in mice, and whether changes in HDL protein composition are  markers of oxidation and/or atherosclerosis Many of these studies will involve the use of novel  mass spectrometric approaches. These studies should provide important information to our longterm  goal of understanding the relationship between inflammation, lipoprotein metabolism and  atherosclerosis."

"8114876","Sensitivity to cigarette smoke-induced COPD is highly variable. Many genetic and environmental factors  that are thought to be responsible for this natural variation, however, remain unidentified. Our preliminary  results suggest that the level of elastin in the lung is critical for normal lung development and for timely and  efficient repair following injury. When elastin levels are below a critical threshold, repair is unproductive and  the lungs are more prone to develop COPD. Moreover, we have found that patients with mutations in the  elastin gene (ELN) develop severe, very early onset bronchiectasis, emphysema and end-stage lung  disease. Rare variants of elastin could also predispose to enhanced lung damage by affecting the quality of  the elastic fiber. In this case, minor alterations in elastin processing or assembly could support normal lung  development and function but result in fibers that have increased susceptibility to degradation by proteases.  The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the quality and quantity of pulmonary elastin is a critical  factor in determining susceptibility to cigarette smoke-induced lung damage, leading to COPD. This  hypothesis is supported by preliminary data indicating that both quantitative and qualitative deficiency in  elastin can predispose to smoke-induced emphysema in both animal models and in inherited syndromes in  humans caused by ELN mutations. The goal of this proposal is to uncover the mechanisms by which elastin  defects result in COPD, and to assess mutations and variants in ELN as risk factors of COPD. To achieve  these goals we propose the following specific aims: Aim 1. To test if human genetic diseases caused by  mutations in ELN are associated with an increased risk of COPD. Aim 2. To test whether genetic variants  present in the normal population (a) alter ELN function and (b) are associated with quantitative outcome  measures in patients with severe emphysema. Aim 3: To test if lower than normal levels of lung elastin  resulting from genetic or environmental factors lead to increased susceptibility to COPD. Aim 4. To test if  qualitative alterations in pulmonary elastin arising from rare elastin variants contribute to COPD  susceptibility."
"9477321","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Anastomosis is a necessary and critical part of all reconstructive surgery involving any luminal structure from cardiovascular to gastrointestinal (GI) surgery. Well over a million anastomoses are performed in the USA each year for visceral indications alone (gastrointestinal, urologic and gynecologic surgery). However, up to 30% of GI anastomoses are complicated by leakage, strictures, and stenosis, in part attributable to technical and technologic issues. An anastomotic complication significantly increases patient mortality from three times up to ten times, and diminishes the function and quality of life for affected patients. Although the minimally invasive surgical approach has transformed surgery with significantly reduced collateral tissue damage associated with access to operative sites, recent advances in surgical tools and vision technology have not addressed the critical factors influencing anastomotic outcome. This is evidenced by the lack of improvements in complication rates. To the contrary, the current minimally invasive surgery (MIS) or robot assisted surgery (RAS) pose additional new challenges for anastomosis stemming from visual and spatial limitations.  The long-term goal of this research is to reduce complications and improve functional outcomes of anastomosis by robotically executing best anastomosis techniques. The following specific aims will enable the development of this technology and demonstrate feasibility, as a path to clinical adoption: Aim 1: Identify optimal suture placements using multispectral imaging. We will compare suture placements and anastomotic outcome between those guided by our novel algorithm for suture location optimization incorporating subsurface anatomic and physiologic information and those performed by expert surgeons in pre-clinical studies. Aim 2: Accurately track mobile and deformable soft tissue targets in an unstructured surgical environment. We will demonstrate how our innovative fused 3D tracking based on plenoptic imaging and NIR marker technology allows real-time, accurate identification and tracking of tissue targets during the task of anastomosis in contrast to current tracking methods in phantom and in-vivo studies. Aim 3: Compare supervised autonomous robotic control to manual anastomosis. We will compare the algorithm of automated suture planning controlled by supervised autonomous robotics to current standard master-slave robotic and manual laparoscopic technology in performing in-vivo anastomosis in preclinical studies.  This research has the potential to significantly improve the function and outcome of anastomosis, independent of surgeon experience. Beyond anastomosis, adoption of this approach could be beneficial in all soft tissue MIS and RAS tasks requiring precision and maneuverability due to small working space, including pediatric and complex cardiac surgery."
"9296016","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-1 and other lentiviruses encode accessory proteins, each of which plays a role in facilitating virus replication and causing pathogenesis. Several of the accessory proteins exert their effect by counteracting antiviral cell proteins. This project focuses on understanding how the two HIV-related accessory proteins, Vpr and Vpx, facilitate virus replication. These proteins are 50% similar in amino acid sequence, are packaged in the virion, localize to the nucleus and bind a specific E3 ubiquitin ligase. Vpx, which is encoded in HIV-2 and SIVmac but not HIV-1, targets the cellular enzyme SAMHD1 for degradation. The target of Vpr has not yet been identified. The mechanism by which SAMHD1 inhibits viruses is not clear. It is a phosphohydrolase that when expressed in myeloid cells, removes the phosphates from the deoxynucleotide triphosphates, depleting the pool of intracellular dNTPs. SAMHD1 is also an exonuclease and which of these activities restricts virus replication is not clear. SAMHD1 does not block the replication of SIVmac or HIV-2 as these viruses encode Vpx. This project seeks to understand (i) the mechanism by which SAMHD1 restricts HIV-1; (ii) how Vpx binds and targets SAMHD1 for degradation; (iii) how Vpx is released from the virus following infection; (iv) how the enzymatic activity of the protein is regulated by post-translational modifications or by associating with regulatory proteins; (v) which amino acid residues of Vpx and SAMHD1 allow the proteins to interact; (vi) how Vpx is imported into the nucleus and (vii) the role of SAMHD1 in the innate immune response to HIV-1 infection. Lastly, an inducible expression system for Vpr will be established to identify the targeted host factor. The findings will shed light on a new mechanism by which the innate immune system restricts HIV-1 and other human pathogens and how viruses have evolved to escape the restriction. Understanding this may provide strategies to therapeutically enhance the effectiveness of the innate immune response for the treatment of infectious diseases."
"9334904","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The advancement of regenerative medicine principles and technologies holds great potential to drive progress in the prevention and treatment of individuals with a host of pathologies resulting from injury, disease or aging. The long-term goal of regenerative medicine is to promote the repair, replacement, or regeneration of tissues. Likewise, rehabilitation seeks to harness the body's innate regenerative potential in order to maximize function. Both fields hold great potential to drive progress in the treatment of a host of acute and chronic pathologies. We propose that these two fields are inextricably intertwined; an intersection of disciplines known as Regenerative Rehabilitation. To fully realize the tremendous potential of Regenerative Rehabilitation, we must promote the interaction of basic scientists with rehabilitation specialists. We must also train rehabilitation clinicians who can help oversee the quality, safety, and validity of these innovative Regenerative Rehabilitation technologies. The overarching goal of the Alliance for Regenerative Rehabilitation Research & Training (AR3T) is to establish a national network that will expand scientific knowledge, expertise and methodologies across the domains of regenerative medicine and rehabilitation.  AR3T will provide didactic training that exposes rehabilitation researchers to cutting-edge investigations and state-of-the-art technologies in the field of regenerative medicine (Specific Aim 1). AR3T will drive the science underlying Regenerative Rehabilitation by: cultivating collaborative opportunities among rehabilitation researchers and internationally renowned investigators in the field of regenerative medicine (Specific Aim 2); launching a pilot funding program to support novel lines of Regenerative Rehabilitation investigations (Specific Aim 3); developing and validating technologies to elucidate the stem cell response to extrinsic mechanical signals (Specific Aim 4). Careful monitoring and evaluation of the effectiveness of our program, as outlined in Specific Aim 5, will ensure that these aims achieve the greatest success possible. These five aims have been organized to parallel each of the P2C grant proposal components."
"9508000","Molecular and physiological studies have revealed that inflammation of adipose tissue is a key determinant in the development of the metabolic syndrome and a variety of animal models have been utilized to identify mechanisms that link adipocytes and macrophages to disease. Of these, the Fatty Acid Binding Protein 4 (FABP4, also known as aP2) loss/gain mouse has been particularly insightful in developing our current understanding of inflammation, ER stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic disease. Fatty acid binding proteins are intracellular FFA chaperones found expressed at high levels in adipocytes and macrophages. Surprisingly, when placed on high fat diets, FABP4 knockout mice exhibit attenuated characteristics of the metabolic syndrome including diminished lipolysis, reduced TNF? and increased adiponectin expression, improved insulin sensitivity, decreased NF-?B activation, protection from asthma and diminished atherogenic capacity. In contrast, mice over-expressing FABP in adipose tissue exhibit potentiated characteristics of the metabolic syndrome including increased lipolysis, exacerbated insulin resistance, decreased adiponectin secretion, and mild cardiac hypertrophy. Similar to the animal models, humans with decreased adipocyte FABP (arising via a polymorphism in the FABP4/aP2 promoter) exhibit reduced risk for hypertriglyceridemia, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. During the last funding cycle the laboratory has identified a novel FABP4-UCP2 axis that regulates lipid metabolism in macrophages and adipocytes. Briefly, molecular, genetic or pharmacologic loss of FABP leads to increased cellular fatty acids and a cascade of events linked to PPAR? activation and the up regulation of UCP2. Increased expression of UCP2 enables increased ?-oxidation of FFA, attenuates pyruvate entry into the mitochondrion, reduces the level of reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress. Diminished ROS reduces mitochondrial protein oxidation, the mitochondrial Unfolded Protein Response (mtUPR), activation of NF-?B signaling, and induction of the inflammasome. The central hypothesis for this application is that the FABP4-FFA equilibrium controls activation of SirT1 and subsequently UCP2 expression in macrophages. Moreover, up regulation of UCP2 is both necessary and sufficient to shift immune cells of high fat fed mice from a classically activated pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype to the alternatively activated anti-inflammatory M2 form. To test this hypothesis, the following specific aims are proposed: Aim 1. Evaluate the regulation of SirT1 by fatty acids and its control by FABP4. Aim 2. Examine cellular metabolism and polarization of cultured macrophages stably overexpressing UCP2. Aim 3. Evaluate the metabolic effects of macrophage-specific knockout and overexpression of UCP2 in experimental mice."
"9380510","Project Summary/Abstract Health is not randomly distributed across people or across space: it tracks a socioeconomic gradient that extends from individuals to the areas in which they live. Individual- and area-level attributes of socioeconomic disadvantage confer risk for a broad range of interrelated physical and neurocognitive health outcomes. This risk is especially apparent in midlife when pathophysiological trajectories of neurocognitive aging that predict risk for dementia in later life begin to accelerate. In this regard, we have provided some of the first evidence that individual- and area- level socioeconomic disadvantage associate with reduced cortical tissue volume and white matter integrity, aspects of brain morphology that show normative shrinkage and integrity loss with age in association with poorer cognitive outcomes. Pathways linking socioeconomic disadvantage to accelerated neurocognitive aging remain unclear. Recent evidence, including our own, suggests that metabolic factors may play a role. Individuals who develop metabolic syndrome, pre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes mellitus are at increased risk for accelerated neurocognitive aging. Furthermore, our recent cross-sectional findings suggest that metabolic risk factors contribute to the associations of area-level disadvantage with brain morphology among midlife adults. Here, we aim to extend this work by longitudinally examining metabolic pathways linking individual- and area-level disadvantage to neurocognitive aging across a 10 year period of midlife. For this purpose, we propose reassessing a sample of 300 cognitively normal midlife adults on whom we collected baseline measures of socioeconomic parameters, metabolic risk, brain morphology and cognitive function 9-10 years ago (mean age at follow-up = 52). Our primary aims examine whether individual- and area-level measures of socioeconomic disadvantage predict changes in brain morphology and cognitive function that decline with age and whether associations of disadvantage with neurocognitive aging are explained by metabolic risk and associated inflammation. We anticipate that this study will contribute to new knowledge to the neurobiology of disparities in cognitive aging."

"9310020","Coeur d'Alene Tribe Retail Food Safety Project Project Summary/Abstract The Coeur d'Alene Tribe's Retail Food Safety Project's main goal is to improve the health, safety and welfare of residents and visitors of the Coeur d'Alene Reservation. This project will improve retail food safety through working toward being verified for conformance with at least 4 of the 9 Food & Drug Administration's Voluntary National Retail Food Regulatory Program Standards by the end of the five-year project period. The Coeur d'Alene Tribe has approximately 20 retail food establishments on the Coeur d'Alene Reservation. These retail food establishments include food programs for children, seniors, the general public and thousands of visitors annually to the Reservation. The Tribe has had an Environmental Health Specialist in the Tribe's Environmental Programs Office of the Natural Resource Department since 1998. The Tribe's food safety program utilizes the current FDA food code as an advisory document for its compliance assistance, education and outreach to Tribal retail food establishments. One main question that the project seeks to answer is whether the Coeur d'Alene Tribe would like to develop and approve a food code that is consistent with the current FDA food code. Once that question is answered, the Tribe will determine if it will be able to pursue verification for conformance with the remaining 5 Program Standards. Another goal of this grant is to determine the feasibility of developing a memorandum of agreement with the state of Idaho's Panhandle Health District for areas such as foodborne illness and food defense preparedness and response, in addition to other aspects of a retail food program. If it is feasible in terms of adequate support from the Tribe and Panhandle Health, as well as from a programmatic perspective, then the Tribe proposes completing a MOA during the project period. The Tribe does not currently have sufficient funding for staff to pursue its retail food safety goals to the degree outlined above. Through providing funds for adequate staff time to pursue these goals, the Tribe will be able to better protect public health through increased retail food safety on the Coeur d'Alene Reservation."
"9307934","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We will investigate potential disease-associated genetic variants in the non-coding regions of the human genome. Recent work in the ENCODE project and in population-scale RNA sequencing has contributed significantly to our knowledge of non-coding elements. Thus, given the focus on coding variation in many previous disease studies, there is much untapped potential in exploring the non-coding variation associated with disease. We plan to prioritize rare, germline non-coding variants for connection to disease, using a generalized framework that we will tune specifically to Prostate Cancer as a test case. Our approach will build upon our existing tool, FunSeq, which prioritizes rare somatic variants in cancer, to create eleVAR - elevating germline VARiants. FunSeq was developed to prioritize somatic variants in regions of the genome depleted of common variants in the general population, based on data from the 1000 Genomes project. eleVAR will use this general principle to analyze germline variations, and build upon it by adding several key features, including: (i) prioritizing variants leading to gain of new transcription-factor (TF) binding sites(in addition to disruption of existing sites), (ii) annotating variants in enhancers and connecting them to target genes, (iii) prioritizing variants highly connected in a variety of biological networks, (iv) annotating variants in non-coding RNAs similarly to those in TF binding sites, and (v) prioritizing variants associated with variable, allele-specific activity. Our second objective s to use eleVAR to prioritize variants in whole genome sequences from the TCGA/ICGC consortium. Our efficient implementation of eleVAR will include a module for updating parameters in response to high throughput experimental data. We will progressively tune and evaluate eleVAR, first using publicly available data, and then using multiple rounds of high throughput experimental characterization of variants occurring specifically in prostate cancer. Our last objective is to functionally validate a subset of variants in details. First, we will idenify variants in the 6 representative eleVAR positives and look at their frequency of occurrence in a large prostate cancer cohort using targeted re-sequencing. We will use the CRISPR/Cas system to generate endogenous mutations, determining their effects on target gene expression, cell morphology and tumorigenicity, and TF binding by EMSA and chromatin immunoprecipitation."
"9209430","Project Summary (Project 1) To improve overall outcome in multiple myeloma (MM), in the current funding period this project achieved two major goals: 1: Defined the role of transplant in the era of novel agents ?establishing integration of transplant with novel agents as the standard of care for newly-diagnosed patients 2: Redefined Complete Remission, establishing the feasibility of measuring minimal residual disease (MRD) using sequencing-based method and its significant impact on prolongation of PFS. In this renewal application, we now propose to build upon our highly successful collaborative clinical study to address the next most important question, whether less intense maintenance (1-drug) provides adequate benefit compared to more intense maintenance (2-drug) and whether MRD negative status should be the ultimate goal. We hypothesize that achieving MRD negative status will lead to long- term disease free survival, and that irrespective of how one gets to MRD negative status, the overall outcome will be similar. To achieve these goals, in Specific Aim 1 we will perform a large 1,260 patient study utilizing lenalidomide, ixazomib, and dexamethasone with daratumumab (RID-Dara) as induction and consolidation post high-dose therapy. Those not achieving MRD negative status will receive 2nd HDT. All MRD negative patients will be randomized to lenalidomide versus lenalidomide plus daratumumab maintenance. The study will also evaluate MRD status at various time points and investigate whether early versus late MRD status will affect overall outcome. In specific Aim 2, we will redefine new risk stratification incorporating MRD status and all genomic/epigenomic correlates."
"9314581","The mission of the Clinical and Translational Research Infrastructure Network (CTR-IN) is to increase the  quantity, quality, and NIH funding of clinical and translational research thereby accelerating the translation of scientific discovery to improved health in the region. We will accomplish this by expanding the regional  collaboration and partnerships initiated by the Mountain West Research Consortium (MWRC, please see  detailed description in Section 1). The efforts of the Administrative Core, and the two supervisory bodies it will support: the Internal Advisory Committee and the External Advisory Committee, will be to further this mission.    Our Policies and Procedures will be established ~ and then modified based on experience and advice through a strategic planning process as the CTR-IN evolves ~ to support this mission.  Our IDeA-CTR project will be designed to address issues that are unusual, in some ways novel, for an  enterprise of this kind; we have many and varied partner institutions and programs, each with individual  strengths and needs, distributed across an area that represents 32.5% of the entire land mass of the US. Thus, our programs cannot be one size fits all, they must be flexible in drawing resources from institutions where expertise is strong, and delivering resources and services where they are needed and can be most effective.    We will achieve this by including every participating institution represented on our Internal Advisory Committee by a high level administrator (Vice President for Research level or equivalent). A primary guiding principle is that the CTR-IN must provide appropriate resources and services to increase clinical and translational research at each of the participating institutions, and that it not simply benefit a few. Through this approach we will develop regional competence and strength in areas fundamental to participation in clinical translational research at a level that will allow us to make meaningful contributions to the scientific literature and clinical practice leveraging the varied populations, cultures, and environments of this unique area of huge open spaces, sparse settlement, and environmental extremes."

"9209426","Project Summary (Core 2) Modern biomedical research is being transformed by what is increasingly becoming a flood of information. Electronic medical records have opened unprecedented opportunities for studies investigating a wide range of problems ranging from epidemiological aspects of human disease to the comparative effectiveness of various treatment protocols. Similarly, genomic technologies such as next-generation DNA and RNA sequencing have opened a floodgate of data and information that promises to shed light on the complex nature of human disease. In this information-rich age, one of the greatest challenges is therefore no longer generating data, but effectively integrating it so that it can be used to advantage. Because clinical practice has long been separate from the research enterprise at most academic health centers, a situation has evolved in which clinical and research data exist in separate, often incompatible domains with a variety of technical, institutional, and organizational barriers between them. Further limiting our ability to extract the maximal value of the data we have available is the fact that data within institutions is rarely integrated with the vast body of data available in the public domain. Similarly, another need is to aid Investigators better characterize and identify tumor biologic and molecular genetic correlates for response, progression, and survival by collecting, preserving and distributing tissue derived from patients on clinical protocol. A large sources of clinical data will be used in this program project. The data for this large IFM/DFCI collaborative clinical trials (1260 MM patients, following induction HDT and consolidation, achieving minimal residual disease will be randomized to lenalidomide with or without daratumumab) are collected in an established clinical trials database at the IFM and DFCI. The aims of Core B are to create, maintain, and quality control the clinical database (Specific Aim 1); to collect, transport, process and store tissue samples from all sites utilizing standardized procedures in centralized tissue banks (Specific Aim 2); and to develop an integrated database to integrate the sample tracking and oncogenomic information with the relevant clinical data from the clinical trials database with web based query capabilities (Specific Aim 3)."
"9257891","Project Summary / Abstract The Bioinformatics and Molecular Modeling Research Support Core (BMMC) will offer computational tools, expertise, and services in three areas as follows: (1) Analysis of data obtained by high throughput genomic technologies (microarray and RNA-sequencing experiments), and integration with public data repositories. Three of five research projects of this proposal employ oligonucleotide arrays or high-throughput sequencing (HTS) methods to determine the genomic and epigenomic effects of Superfund chemicals. (2) High-throughput in vitro screening of chemicals, and modeling of the association of their transcriptional responses with adverse phenotypes and with other perturbations. (3) Modeling the interactions between xenobiotics and protein receptors using methods of structural bioinformatics and computational toxicology, including some tools originally developed by the BMMC for structure-based drug design. The analyses will focus on aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and AHR-interacting protein (AIP) (Project 4) and on nuclear receptors peroxisome proliferator activated receptor ? (PPAR?) and retinoid X receptor (RXR), as well as cytochrome P450 enzymes in fish (Project 5). While the projects generate information on the effects of various chemicals on cells and whole organisms, computational studies of receptor-ligand interactions will help to develop hypotheses on the mechanisms at the molecular level and to design specific binding and activity experiments for validation. The Core will be a full-service bioinformatics and molecular modeling research support center for the statistical analysis and interpretation of genomic data and for the design of receptor-ligand interactions studies, providing the computational infrastructure to deal with large amounts of data and manage a large variety of bioinformatics, statistical, and molecular modeling software tools. The Core Leader has a 16-year long experience in the design and development of computational methods for the analysis and integration of genomic data, and will direct a full-time postdoctoral associate with Bioinformatics training. They will analyze microarray and HTS data, working together with graduate students and post-doctoral fellows from the individual projects, who will gain direct, first-hand training in these techniques and methods through their interaction with the Core. The Core Co-Investigator/Co-Leader is an expert in molecular modeling, and will work with an experienced Research Assistant Professor on modeling interactions between environmental pollutants and protein receptors as required by the BUSRP projects."
"8114783","The Vascular Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Core is designed to provide investigators with access to  routine as well as state-of-the-art molecular and biochemical tools, expertise, and techniques. The central theme  of this Program Project is that exercise induces beneficial phenotypic changes in vascular cells. Our long-term  objectives are to advance the understanding of the molecular, biochemical, cellular, and integrative mechanisms  that underlie these training effects. The application of molecular and biochemical techniques will be integral in  the exploration of the mechanisms underlying the physiological observations made by this PPG group. The  Core's activity reflects a centralization and expansion of services that the Core Leader has successfully provided  to PPG investigators for the past decade. The Core laboratory is fully equipped and dedicated to address the  stated goals and is directed and staffed by well-qualified personnel. The following Aims are based on the needs  of the PPG investigators and reflect a compilation of procedures and techniques that will ensure the efficient  completion of each PPG project. The long-term goal of this Core is to track the expression and modulation of  specific proteins throughout the coronary and peripheral vasculature and to demonstrate an effect of exercise  and/or high-fat-cholesterol on these features. Aim 1 is to perform reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) to detect  specific mRNAs expressed throughout the vasculature. Aim 2 is to perform real-time PCR in order to more  accurately quantitate mRNA expression in select samples from the vasculature of control and experimental  animals. Aim 3 is to utilize immunoblots and co-immunoprecipitations to detect and relatively quantitate specific  proteins and interactions expressed throughout the circulation. Aim 4a is to use in situ PCR to demonstrate  tissue-specific expression of select mRNA species. Aim 4b is to use laser-capture microdissection to selectively  isolate and recover select cells from sections of vascular tissue. Real-time PCR will then be used to assess  mRNA levels in the recovered cells. Aim 5 is to generate two commercial libraries (one from conduit arteries and  one from resistance arterioles) and screen for cDNAs encoding select proteins from the coronary vasculature.  Aim 6 is to prepare adeno-associated viral constructs for the transduction of various proteins and siRNA into  vascular cells. Aim 7 is to coordinate the commercial preparation of select porcine-specific antibodies. Aim 8 is  to prepare and analyze peripheral blood cells from transgenic and non-transgenic pigs. Aim 9 is to provide  additional standard techniques as well as pioneer new methods as a resource for PPG investigators."
"8114915","COPD is characterized by limitation of expiratory airflow that is not reversible. The primary site of the airflow limitation is the small airways. Smoking cessation and/or corticosteroid therapy only partially improves the airflow limitation in COPD. It is not known whether these therapies fail because of irreversible structural changes or because they have limited effect on the abnormal biologic processes in the small airways. This project focuses on the biologic changes in the small airway epithelium in COPD, and the reversibility of these changes with therapeutic intervention. We hypothesize that smoking cessation and/or anti-inflammatory therapies do normalize some of the altered patterns of gene expression in the small airway epithelium in COPD, and that the identification of the alterations in small airway epithelial gene expression that are, andare not, reversed by these interventions will provide targets for the future development of therapies for COPD. Using newly developed technology with fiberoptic bronchoscopy with brushings of the small airways to obtain pure small airway epithelium, microarray assessment in COPD vs normal smokers and non-smokers allowed us to identify genes in different categories relevant to the pathogenesis of COPD. This molecular signature of the small airway epithelium is the focus of the 3 aims of this proposal. Aim 1 - to assess the hypothesis that the alterations in gene expression in the small airway epithelium associated with COPD are at least partially reversible with smoking cessation. We propose to study healthy smokers and nonsmokers, individuals with COPD (GOLD 0,1,and III), and individuals with early emphysema who do not meet the GOLD criteria. Gene expression will be evaluated at baseline and after smoking cessation. Aim 2 - To assess the hypothesis that the alterations in gene expression in the small airway epithelium associated with COPD are at least partially reversible with treatment with corticosteroid. Aim 3 - To assess the hypothesis that the alterations in gene expression in the small airway epithelium associated with COPD are at least partially reversible with treatment with an inhibitor of leukotriene synthesis."

"8106506","The Tissue Culture Core Laboratory will be responsible for providing investigators with cultured cells, antibodies, and facilities for routine microscopic analysis of biological samples. The core will be directed by Dr. Goldstein. He will be assisted by Drs. Y.K. Ho, Richard Anderson, Joachim Herz, and Rob Rawson. The technical work in the Tissue Culture Facility of this Core is carried out by four experienced technicians (Lisa Beatty, Angela Carroll, Jill Fairless, Marissa Hodgin) and one laboratory assistant (Rose Marshall). The Tissue Culture Facility of this Core is located in the Department of Molecular Genetics and consists of three suites of rooms that are used solely for tissue culture. One suite contains four work modules that open into a common work area; the second suite contains three work modules that open into a common work area; and the third suite contains two work modules, one for adenovirus work and the other for baculovirus. Each module is equipped with a sterile work area (Biological Safety Cabinet hood), one or more CO2 incubators, a refrigerator, and an inverted microscope. The common work area in each of the suites contains one or two sterile work areas. The entire facility contains a total of 12 inverted microscopes (6 of which are phase-contrast microscopes), 1 stereo microscope, 15 sterile work areas (hoods), 28 singlechamber CO2 incubators, 2 non-CO2 refrigerated incubators, 1 roller bottle incubator, 3 refrigerated incubator shakers, 3 table-top refrigerated centrifuges, and 9 refrigerators. Four liquid nitrogen freezers for storage of cell lines are located in the common work area adjacent to the work modules. In addition to this standard equipment, we have a Zeiss Axiovert 35 M inverted fluorescence microscope that allows us to visualize cells directly in the Petri dish (under sterile conditions) so as to determine whether or not they have taken up reconstituted fluorescent LDL. This method is the assay of choice for identifying and monitoring mutant cholesterol auxotrophic cell clones that are resistant to amphotericin and thus fail to take up fluorescent LDL (Research Project 1). The success of the entire Program Project depends on the smooth operation of the Tissue Culture Facility. Each of the six Research Projects will depend directly on the availability of cultured cells. Over the past 33 years, we have developed considerable experience in maintaining and growing multiple cell types, including diploid human fibroblasts, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, Sp2/O-Ag14 myeloma cells, simian COS cells, human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells, rat-1 fibroblasts, mouse embryonic fibroblasts, human lymphoblastoid cells, HeLa cells, rat FT02B hepatoma cells, human Huh-7 hepatoma cells, SV-40 transformed fibroblasts (SV-589), Sf9 insect cells, High Five insect cells, and Drosophila S2 cells. We have also become expert in culturing pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cells (ES cells), which will be used in Research Projects 2, 3, 5, and 6 for gene targeting experiments. Since 1973, over 1000 different primary human fibroblast cell strains, derived from skin biopsies from normal subjects as well as from patients with metabolic disorders, have been initiated in our laboratory. Multiple aliquots of cells from early passages of each of these strains are stored in liquid nitrogen. Our collection of frozen mutant cell lines includes fibroblasts from more than 160 subjects with the homozygous form of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Remarkably, we have been successful in carrying out metabolic experiments on mutant fibroblasts that we froze away 32 years ago. Since 1984, thousands of transfection experiments have been carried out in which we have introduced into various cell lines multiple plasmid constructs containing either the protein-coding region or the promoter regions of the genes for the LDL receptor, HMG CoA reductase, HMG CoA synthase, the oxysterol binding protein, SREBP-1 and -2, SCAP, Site-1 protease, Site-2 protease, lnsig-1 and -2, and.a and psubunits of farnesyltransferasel and a and ft-subunits of Rab geranylgeranyl transferase, REP-1 and -2, cholesterol 7-hydroxylase, oxysterol 7-hydroxylase, VLDL receptor, various domains of LRP, RAP, ApoER2, SR-B1 scavenger receptor, ARM, ABCG5/8, PCSK9, etc. From these transfections, more than 1200 stable and permanent cell lines have been established and used for biochemical analyses. Multiple aliquots of each of these transfected cell lines have been frozen in liquid nitrogen. These numbers do not include the thousands of transient transfections performed in HEK-293, COS, CHO cells, and SV589 cells. Based on current experience, we anticipate that we will be setting up for experiments approximately 600 Petri dishes of cells each day, of which 350 will be small dishes (60-mm) and 250 will be large dishes (100-mm). We have learned that certain aspects of quality control are essential in obtaining reproducible results for metabolic experiments in tissue culture cells. The following measures are rigorously enforced in our dayto- day operation: 1) An aliquot of calf serum from each batch of 100 liters is pretested prior to its general use so as to ensure that the serum is not toxic to our fibroblasts and that it supports a high cloning efficiency for CHO cells. 2) Cells in current use are routinely checked for Mycoplasma contamination in two ways: 1) by sending aliquots of the medium from 10 different cell lines to the ATCC Mycoplasma Testing Service (Manassas, VA) once per year; and 2) by our own testing with the use of a Myoplasma PCR Elisa test kit (Roche). 3) The generation time of each human fibroblast cell strain is monitored by a standard procedure, as follows: each week, each confluent stock flask is split 1:2, and the passage number is raised by 2. All stock flasks are discarded when the passage number exceeds 25. This procedure ensures that the growth rates of different aliquots of the same cell strain do not differ appreciably, and it also ensures that our experiments are carried out on cells that are well within Phase II of their growth cycle (Littlefield, J.W. In Variation, Senescence, and Neoplasia in Cultured Somatic Cells. Harvard University Press, Boston, 1976. pp. 54-77). 4) In setting up a typical experiment with nontransfected or permanently transfected cells, cells from the stock flasks are trypsinized under rigidly controlled conditions, counted using a hemacytometer, and 10 to 30 replicate dishes of cells are prepared under identical conditions. 5) In experiments designed to compare a normal and a mutant cell line or a nontransfected and a transfected cell line, Petri dishes of cells from both cell lines are always set up in parallel on the same day and grown in the same medium side by side in the same incubator. With these precautions, among others, our laboratory has been able to generate data on fibroblasts and other cell types that are reproducible from year to year, thus enabling rapid progress in the delineation of metabolic processes. In addition to the maintenance of stock cell lines and preparation of cultured cells for experiments, the Tissue Culture Core will be involved in the following activities: 1) Maintenance of our previously characterized hybridoma cell lines in suspension culture (in roller bottles) and production of large amounts of IgG fractions of monoclonal antibodies from culture medium. The following monoclonal antibodies are currently being produced and purified by Protein G column chromatography for use by investigators in the Program Project: anti-LDL receptor (lgG-C7); anti-SREBP-1 and anti-SREBP-2 (lgG-2A4, lgG-7D4, lgG-1C6, lgG-1D2); anti-Scap (lgG-9D5); anti-HMG CoA reductase (lgG-A9); and anti-Myc (lgG-9E10). Several new monoclonal antibodies against the membrane domain of Scap and against different domains of PCSK9 are currently being characterized. Moreover, mice have recently been injected with purified human lnsig-1 and lnsig-2 for producing hybridomas. 2) Purification by Protein G chromatography of more than 20 different polyclonal rabbit antibodies directed against the multiple proteins that are studied in this Program Project Grant. 3) Growth of large volumes of HEK-293S cells in suspension culture that allow the efficient transfection of cDNAs and the production of their encoded proteins. The HEK-293S cells have proved extremely valuable in the initial evaluation of the functional properties of proteins produced by newly cloned cDNAs. 4) Isolating, maintaining, and freezing away cloned cell lines that have been transfected with mutated versions of various cDNA and promoter constructs"

We attribute our success in both post- and pre-doctoral training to: 1) attracting and recruiting high quality, diverse applicants; ) an individualized training experience to meet trainee goals; 3) a mentoring strategy consistent with multidisciplinary work; 4) an organizational culture of synergy between training and research missions; 5) an extensive research portfolio (exceeding $40 million/year in Public Health); and 6) over 30 multidisciplinary faculty committed to pre and post-doctoral training.  Specific aims of this training program are: 1) To recruit highly qualified socio-demographically diverse post- and pre-doctoral trainees; 2) To develop scientists experienced in the use of state-of-the-art health services research methods, with specific foci in evidence-based medicine, comparative effectiveness research, chronic disease and aging, etc.; 3) To develop scientists skilled in the communication of scientific knowledge who are able to work in multidisciplinary teams in academia, government and the private sector; 4) To provide didactic as well as hands on supervised experience in research by matching trainees with externally funded research teams; and, 5) To develop scientists equipped with the leadership skills to improve health care delivery and influence health policy."
"8107007","It has been shown that several amphipathic helical peptide mimetics of apolipoprotein (apo) A-l inhibit  atherosclerosis, improve vascular function, and reduce inflammatory processes. It has also been shown that  co-administration of peptide with statin regresses already-existing atherosclerotic lesions. We hypothesize  that these peptides modify high density lipoprotein (HDL) or recruit phospholipids and apo A-l to form apo Al-  containing particles which in turn recruit antiatherogenic enzymes such as paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) and/or  platelet activating-factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH). We intend to determine if peptides have antiatherosclerotic  properties in the absence of apo A-l or PON-1. We hypothesize that mimetic peptides act by  recruiting apo A-l into new, more bioactive particles, or by modifying the structure of apo A-l so that it is more  bioactive. This may allow it to recruit and/or activate PON-1, resulting in a reduction of atherogenic oxidized  lipids. We will study three peptides: 4F, which is strongly atheroprotective; 3F14, which has no observed  atheroprotective properties; and peptide 2F, which is intermediate in its in vitro atheroprotective properties.  These peptides differ only in the number of phenylalanine residues on the hydrophobic face. The following  specific aims are proposed: Specific Aim 1: The role of apo A-l in peptide function. The hypothesis to be  tested is that apo A-l is required for mimetic peptide function, a: We will study the effect of peptides on apo  A-l synthesis and secretion, b: We will use atherosclerosis-susceptible mice, either expressing wild-type apo  A-l or apo A-l null. We will study the requirement of apo A-l for peptide-mediated functions. Specific Aim 2:  The role of PON-1 in peptide function. The hypothesis to be tested is that PON-1 is required for mimetic  peptide function, a: Peptide-mediated changes in PON-1 levels and activity will be determined, b: Using  atherosclerosis-susceptible mice expressing PON-1 or PON-1 null, anti-inflammatory properties of the  peptides will be studied.  HDL is considered to be protective against atherosclerotic heart disease. We are studying the major protein  of HDL, apo A-l, using small molecules called peptides to mimic the properties of apo A-l. These studies will  be done using mouse models that are susceptible to atherosclerosis. The objective is to better understand  how apo A-l and HDL are protective, and to develop methods to improve those protective properties."
"9278710","This competitive renewal is to continue the Aging and Development Training Program in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at Washington University. Because of the increased demands of an aging population on society along with the concomitant increased health risks, there is a critical need to train researchers to better understand what does and does not lead to successful aging. Requests are made to support the training of the next generation of researchers in aging at both the predoctoral level and at the postdoctoral level. There are currently 14 faculty who serve as the Preceptors (primary mentors) in this program along with 3 Affiliated (Other) faculty. This training program focuses on the Psychology of Aging, and emphasizes a multifaceted approach to individual differences in their aging trajectory including the following interrelated themes: cognitive aging, cognitive neuroscience in healthy and abnormal aging, personality and social aging, and translational science. Although trainees will develop depth within one of these themes, the program is designed to expose trainees to breadth across themes. The program trains candidates both in clinical and non-clinical areas of Psychology and benefits from the emphasis at Washington University on aging and age-related diseases, as reflected by the Charles F. and Joanne Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and the Center for Aging. As described in the proposal, the Department continues its emphasis on the Psychology of Aging, with 5 of the last 7 faculty hires having substantive research focus in aging, which makes this program ideal for training. In this proposal we document the high quality of the program trainees and faculty, the structure of its well-established training program and its assessment, and the success of the training."
"9306905","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Low-income children and children of obese parents are at high risk of obesity. Effective interventions are needed to target these families to improve the health of the parents and prevent obesity in the children. The hypothesis is that an intervention that combines engagement of community organizations, motivational interviewing (MI, a technique proven to help people set goals that are personally meaningful), and resource mobilization will change diet and physical activity habits among disadvantaged families. This proposal grew from an established community-based participatory research (CBPR) partnership between the research team and community organizations that serve high minority (45-55%), low-income populations. Partners include a community health center, a food pantry network, a work-force training program, and other agencies. These partners designed and implemented a successful pilot project on which this proposal is based. The specific aims of this proposal are 1) to evaluate the efficacy of a family-targeted obesity intervention based on MI and resource-mobilization. Hypotheses: In comparison to control families, families participating in the intervention will demonstrate a) a reduction in BMI for adults, b) an increase in minutes of moderate physical activity and decreased sedentary time for both adults and children (accelerometer), and c) a reduction in the number of obesity risk behaviors and an increase in obesity prevention behaviors among children. 2) To examine the mediators of intervention effects. 3) identify the types of resources needed most often by intervention families to support lifestyle change. This randomized controlled trial includes 260 low-income families that contain at least one obese adult and one normal or overweight child between 6 and 12. The 12-month intervention has two elements. 1) A health coach will use MI to help families explore ambivalence toward and motivations for change and set goals for improving diet and physical activity. 2) To support goals, families will be connected with community agencies that can assist with general (e.g., financial) and goal specific resources (e.g., food, physical activity opportunities). Collaboration between organizations will streamline referrals, maximize resources, and facilitate access. Control families will get a basic screen for needs and information about available community resources. Outcomes are measured at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months. This intervention is innovative in that it 1) focuses on lifestyle changes for the entire family and measures outcomes in adults and children, 2) combines MI focused on the entire family and community resource referrals specific to family needs and goals for change, 3) partners community organizations to coordinate resources for families, and 4) involves partners in all research phases via a CBPR approach. This contribution will be significant because the proposed intervention, if successful, can be replicated elsewhere and adapted to the local resource environment to address adult obesity and prevent childhood obesity in a high-risk population. The study will also identify the types of resources low-income families need to change diet and physical activity."
"9379804","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Project Summary/Abstract:  Approximately 75% of adults with serious mental illness (SMI) have a desire to work, but the level of unemployment for this population ranges from 85-90% (1-4). In addition to enjoying the benefit of increased income, research evidence indicates that persons with SMI who work also experience the additional benefits of increased self-esteem, satisfaction with finances, satisfaction with leisure and overall life satisfaction (5). Among the various types of vocational rehabilitation services currently available, supported employment (SE) is the most effective service for persons with SMI (13, 15, 16) and the VA has mandated that this evidence-based practice be offered as part of Compensated Work Therapy (CWT) Programs throughout the VA (21). Despite this mandate, there is a low rate of utilization of SE within the VA (22). Motivational interviewing (MI) is an evidence-based clinical practice with demonstrated effectiveness in producing desirable behavior change in the use of alcohol and drugs, as well other outcomes such as binge eating, smoking, treatment attendance, medication compliance and gambling (26- 34). Recently, Drebing (47), Glynn (45) and Mueller (46) have begun investigating the effectiveness of MI for increasing the rate of entry and length of participation n vocational rehabilitation programs among veterans with SMI. Mueller and her colleagues are currently conducting a clinical trial investigating the effectiveness of MI for increasing the rateof entry into SE and competitive employment outcomes.  This two-year study analyzes archival data from the Mueller (46) study in which 79 unemployed veterans with serious mental illness (SMI) agreed to audiotaping and received either general supportive counseling (control) or Motivational Interviewing (experimental) in up to six sessions conducted over a period of six months. The purpose of the present study is to further analyze data from these research sessions to identify key ingredients of MI that are associated with the action of taking a step toward using SE services. Each MI research session is rated as having either a successful or unsuccessful outcome on the variable of taking a step toward supported SE utilization, which serves as the study dependent variable. The 206 audiotaped MI sessions conducted with participants in the experimental condition are coded using MISC 2.1 coding and analyzed using Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) modeling to identify significant predictors of taking a step toward using SE. The independent variables are: a) therapist behaviors (spirit of MI and MI technical proficiency); and b) client behaviors (intensity and frequency of change talk and counter change talk). Covariates examined include age, race, mental health diagnosis, health status, work motivation, work importance, duration of unemployment, and type of disability benefits received.  The study also analyzes sessions from 16 MI participants and 16 control participants using a grounded theory qualitative approach to identify emergent patterns and themes in the sessions. These findings are then combined with the quantitative findings to develop conceptual frameworks that explain differences between veterans with a successful outcome and those with an unsuccessful outcome.  Study results are translated into recommendations regarding the components of MI that should receive greatest emphasis when training clinicians who will use MI with veterans who have SMI. The study also identifies additional factors influencing the taking of steps toward utilization of SE by veterans with SMI. New information obtained from this study will be useful for VA policy makers, administrators, clinicians, vocational rehabilitation specialists, and researchers interested in reducing the underutilization of Supported Employment, an evidence-based practice, and in improving employment outcomes that contribute to the overall recovery process for veterans with serious mental illness."

"9318446","Project Summary/Abstract: Advanced Imaging & NanoString Core Research on human skin diseases has been hampered by limitations on the number of studies that can be done on formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) specimens, the most frequent type generated in the course of clinical care, by clinical trials and available in specimen archives. The purpose of this Core is to accelerate human skin disease research by providing access to two transformative techniques, six color immunostaining, spectral imaging and automated cell analyses and NanoString-based analyses, which taken together allow comprehensive evaluation of protein and gene expression in FFPE specimens. Tyramide amplification based serial immunostaining allows six color labeling of FFPE specimens with no antibody species interference, long term signal stability and minimal quenching. We provide multi spectral imaging on the cutting edge Perkin- Elmer Mantra imaging system, providing image deconvolution and automated cell analyses. The techniques allow automatic identification, counting, and measurement of fluorescence signals in other channels for individual cell types in the section, yielding the equivalent of flow cytometry data from immunostained tissue sections. The Core also provides validated antigen retrieval and staining protocols, validated antibody panels, and staining and image acquisition services that make these techniques rapidly accessible to researchers at any institution. NanoString analysis provides quantitative measurement of up to 800 DNA or RNA targets in a single test run and is the first nucleic acid analysis technique that works well in FFPE tissues. The Core provides access to a cutting-edge n-Counter instrument, as well as sample preparation and data acquisition services that make these analyses accessible to outside investigators. This Core is run by renowned dermatopathologist Dr. Martin Mihm, who will provide consultative assistance to Center users to enhance their understanding of human skin disease. The research community potentially includes any individual wishing to carry out human skin disease research. We have included projects from 24 investigators who wish to utilize Center services, 23 of whom would like to utilize the Advanced Imaging & NanoString Core for their projects. 15 are from outside institutions, nine have never worked in human skin disease before and seven have worked primarily in mouse models previously, with little or no prior work in humans. Eight of these projects are described in detail in this component and other projects are described fully in the two other Resource Core portions of the application. In summary, the Advanced Imaging & NanoString Core provides access to two powerful new techniques that allow comprehensive analysis of protein and gene expression in FFPE samples, with the goal of accelerating human skin disease research."
"9367375","PROJECT SUMMARY Alcohol use disorder is a major public health problem. To date, available treatment options are limited to psychosocial intervention, three FDA approved medications (disulfuram, acamprosate, and naltrexone) and a few drugs approved for other indications, all with relatively small effect sizes. There is a clear need for additional treatments based on a deeper understanding of neurobiological mechanisms. Corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) is a 41-amino acid neuropeptide produced mainly by neurons of the paraventricular hypothalamus, central amygdala (CeA), and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) where it plays an important role in behavioral and physiological responses to stress. CRF has been long implicated in driving excessive ethanol consumption through prior studies that used CRF receptor antagonists in rodents. However, recent attempts to test CRF receptor antagonists as treatments for alcohol craving in humans have been disappointing. Part of this lack of success may be due to inadequate drug-like properties of some compounds and by a need for different human laboratory models that test drug effects on withdrawal and negative reinforcement in dependent subjects. Another reason may be due to the fact that CRF is released from neurons with other peptides and neurotransmitters that may act in synergy to drive excessive drinking. Understanding which of these co-released factors is important necessitates a different strategy that focuses on the CRF neurons themselves rather than on CRF receptors. The lack of genetic access to subpopulations of CRF neurons has made it difficult to study the biology of CRF neurons, the sources of CRF in different brain regions, and the circuitry underlying CRF-regulated behaviors. To fill this gap, we generated a BAC transgenic Wistar rat line in which Cre recombinase is expressed from the Crh gene promoter to enable genetic access to CRF neurons. In this project, we will use these rats to pursue the hypothesis that as animals develop ethanol dependence, CRF neurons in the CeA and BNST promote ethanol consumption through the coordinated release of GABA, CRF, and other neuropeptides. We will examine this hypothesis by selectively activating or inhibiting these neuronal populations and their projections using chemogenetic tools, and we will address the relative importance of the different transmitters and modulators released from these neurons using Cre-dependent RNA interference. Finally, we will investigate the role of repeated ethanol consumption on the transcriptome of these CRF neuronal populations to understand how ethanol changes their phenotype, which should provide us with important new clues as to how they drive excessive drinking. !"

"9357737","Abstract Over the last two decades there has been a rapid increase in chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu) that has emerged in rural, arid, agricultural lowland regions in multiple countries. These regions report 15 to 20% prevalence among men and women between the ages of 30 to 60. CKDu is a progressive and irreversible disease resulting in renal failure and death unless dialysis or a kidney transplant is available. The primary effort to date has focused on identification of the etiological factors that cause CKDu, but the result of intensive investigation have been frustratingly inconclusive leaving public health officials and agricultural workers with little guidance for preventing the disease. In the absence of an approach to prevention, this proposed research will focus on identifying factors associated with delaying progression of the disease in Sri Lanka, one of the countries hardest hit by the CKDu epidemic. The project will be conducted in a rural endemic area of Sri Lanka and calls for an interdisciplinary study focused on identifying the environmental, behavioral and health care factors that are associated with the rate of progression of CKDu from moderate to more advanced CKDu. The project is a collaboration between the University of Connecticut in the US and the University of Peradeniya in Sri Lanka and involves environmental, social and medical scientists from both institutions. A sample of 300 male and female farmers with moderate CKDu as measured by their serum creatinine level will be generated from a Ministry of Health screening in the study area conducted prior to the initiation of the project and followed by quarterly serum creatinine testing by the project to determine trajectory of progression for the individuals in the study sample. The project objective is to identify the factors in the domains of the environment, behavior and health care that are associated with more rapid or slower CKD progression. The specific aims of this proposed project are to: (1) Assess and monitor agrochemicals in water and soil of the microenvironments of individuals with CKDu; (2) Identify behaviors related to farming including hydration, pesticide and agrochemical use during farming, and non-farming behavior including psychological states, stigma, alcohol and tobacco use; (3) Examine the use of health care by individuals with CKDu including use of allopathic v. non-allopathic (e.g. ayurvedic, healer, spiritualist) care, medication adherence, and co-morbidities; and (4). Increase the capacity of faculty and students from both institutions to conduct interdisciplinary research with regard to CKDu in Sri Lanka and other endemic countries. The proposed study would be the first in Sri Lanka to focus on disease progression and potentially transformative for these affected communities. The project also provides the opportunity for cross-disciplinary, cross-national exchange that can be generate a model for addressing NCDs in Sri Lanka and other countries."
"9276728","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am an Assistant Professor in Pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) with a long-standing research interest in hyperoxic lung injury. My main career goal is to become an established investigator with a focus on understanding the role of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in hyperoxia-induced developmental lung injury. The primary objective of my K08 proposal is to obtain the career development award that values protected research time and the involvement of senior mentors to formulate an educational curriculum and oversee my research progress, both of which are crucial in attaining my career goals. As a postdoctoral fellow, I investigated the molecular mechanisms of hyperoxic lung injury in adult mice and laid the groundwork for the proposed research. I have enrolled for a PhD offered by Clinical Scientist Training Program at BCM, where I will be educated and trained in molecular methods, molecular genetics, biostatistics, grant writing, and ethics in research to enhance my career development. The renowned BCM provides an outstanding core of mentors and an enriched environment to support my training and research. My primary mentor, Dr. Bhagavatula Moorthy, is a renowned researcher with successful funding in determining the mechanistic roles of cytochrome P450 1A enzymes in hyperoxic lung injury, and the regulation of AhR by the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. In addition to Dr. Moorthy, my advisory committee consists of Drs. Stephen Welty, Francesco DeMayo, David Moore, and E. O'Brian Smith of BCM who are leaders in research related to this proposal. We observed that omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, attenuates hyperoxic lung injury in adult wild type mice and oxygen toxicity in adult human lung cells via activation of the AhR. Whether AhR activation results in a similar effect in newborn mice and in newborn human lung cells are unknown. My research will test the central hypotheses that the proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), i.e. omeprazole and lansoprazole, protect against hyperoxia-induced alveolar simplification in newborn mice in vivo and against oxygen toxicity in neonatal human lung cells in vitro via activation of the pulmonary AhR. I will test this hypothesis by pursuing the following 3 specific aims: 1. Determine the effects of the PPIs on alveolarization and pulmonary vascularization in hyperoxia-exposed newborn mice. 2. Determine the effects of the PPIs on the activation of pulmonary AhR in newborn wild type (WT) mice. 3. Determine the effects of PPI-mediated activation of the AhR on hyperoxia exposed human neonatal lung cells. The lungs of the air- or hyperoxia-exposed newborn WT and AhR-null mice treated with PPIs will be assessed for AhR activation, alveolarization, pulmonary vascularization, oxidative stress and inflammation. Air- or hyperoxia- exposed neonatal human pulmonary microvascular endothelial and alveolar epithelial cells treated with PPIs in the presence or absence of the AhR will be analyzed for AhR activation, oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis and necrosis. I anticipate that the results will support my hypotheses, which will lead to novel strategies in the prevention and treatment of BPD in premature infants."
"9363392","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In type 2 diabetes (T2D), insulin-stimulated blood flow to skeletal muscle is markedly blunted which significantly limits glucose uptake, thus contributing to impaired glucose homeostasis. A detailed understanding of the precipitating factors and mechanisms underlying the defects in vasodilator actions of insulin is critical for the development of therapeutic strategies aimed at improving glycemic control and protecting against cardiovascular disease. Based on our prior work and most recent preliminary data, we propose that in hyperglycemic T2D patients, protein kinase C (PKC) activation drives the upregulation of endothelin-1 (ET-1) and consequent impairment in insulin-induced dilation. Furthermore, we hypothesize that increased vascular exposure to shear stress, associated with physical activity, mitigates these toxic molecular effects of hyperglycemia on endothelial cells and lead to substantial improvements in insulin-induced dilation in T2D. Specifically, we will test the overarching hypothesis that endothelial PKC activation mediates the upregulation of ET-1 and impairment in insulin-induced dilation in patients with T2D, a defect that can be corrected with increased physical activity and shear stress. In Aims 1 and 2, ex vivo functional studies will be performed in isolated visceral resistance arteries from obese T2D and obese non-T2D patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. Through gain- and loss-of-function experiments, we will examine the role of PKC activation in mediating impaired insulin-induced dilation in arteries from T2D patients as well as the role of hyperglycemia and shear stress in modulating insulin-induced dilation. In Aim 3, we will perform a clinical study in patients with T2D to determine the effects of increased walking and shear stress on insulin-stimulated leg blood flow. In particular, we will test the hypothesis that increased walking for 8 weeks decreases vascular PKC activation and ET-1 production, thus leading to an improvement in insulin-stimulated leg blood flow. Leg blood flow via Doppler ultrasound will be assessed during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Skeletal muscle biopsies will be performed for vascular phenotypic characterization. Furthermore, we will determine if increased leg vascular shear stress using a non-exercise stimulus (i.e., leg heating intervention for 8 weeks) recapitulates the beneficial vascular effects of increased walking. Targeting PKC activation and ET-1, pharmacologically or through an increase in shear stress, may be key for correction of vascular insulin resistance and ultimately improvement of metabolic and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with T2D. Indeed, our research team is poised to move cardiovascular and diabetes research forward in an area currently receiving little attention, despite its importance and clear need for investigation."

We have isolated the protein from rat and bovine lungs, have identified the full length cDNA for the human, rat, mouse and bovine enzyme, have generated recombinant protein, and have developed a panel of antibodies that are effective for western blotting, immunoprecipitation and immunocytochemistry. aiPLA2 is Ca++-independent, shows maximal activity at pH 4, and represents a lysosomal-type PLA2. During the present period of grant support, we have shown that aiPLA2: 1) plays a major role in degradation of internalized alveolar DPPC; 2) provides substrate for the reacylation pathway of DPPC synthesis; 3) activity is regulated through protein-protein interactions with SP-A; 4) is localized in lung to lamellar bodies and lysosomes; 5) is activated by phosphorylation; and 6) its expression is developmental^ regulated and hormonally responsive. Specific Aim 1 will study models of under- and over-expression of aiPLA2 (knockout and transgenic mice) in order to evaluate the physiologic role of the enzyme in DPPC degradation and synthesis using isolated cells, the isolated perfused lung, and in vivo studies. Time-related (aging) changes in lung phospholipid content will be determined. Specific Aim 2 will evaluate the structure-function relationships for aiPLA2 activity utilizing"
"9410775","PROJECT SUMMARY Gay and bisexual men (GBM), and other men who have sex with men (MSM), represent the largest group of individuals infected with HIV in the U.S. At current rates, 1 in 6 MSM will be diagnosed with HIV in their lifetime. Extant research has largely focused on identifying individual- and interpersonal-level risk factors for HIV infection among GBM; however, accumulating evidence also points to structural determinants of HIV outcomes in this population. In particular, recent research has demonstrated that structural stigma?defined as societal- level conditions, cultural norms, and institutional policies that constrain the resources and opportunities of stigmatized individuals?is associated with adverse health outcomes, including HIV risk, among GBM. For example, pilot data from our research group showed that 4,098 GBM living in states with high levels of structural stigma?measured with a composite index of discriminatory state laws and negative social attitudes towards homosexuality?had lower levels of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) knowledge and use, lower odds of HIV testing, and greater odds of condomless anal sex compared with those living in low structural stigma states. While promising, the few existing studies of structural stigma and HIV outcomes among GBM have been limited by a reliance on cross-sectional designs, a small number of structural covariates, little attention to mediators/moderators of the structural stigma-HIV risk association, and non-probability samples of GBM. To address these limitations, we will create a new, prospective, nationally representative study of HIV-uninfected/unknown status GBM who will be followed for 5 waves of data collection over a 24-month period (N=500). With a representative sample of participants from across the U.S., we will have substantial variation in the social context surrounding GBM. This will be the first and largest prospective study with a nationally representative sample of GBM specifically designed to: (1) examine whether structural forms of stigma related to sexual identity increase vulnerability to adverse HIV prevention outcomes (e.g., less HIV testing and PEP/PrEP use); (2) identify mutable mechanisms (e.g., self-stigma, depressive symptoms, safer-sex self efficacy) through which structural stigma influences HIV outcomes; and (3) evaluate resilience processes (e.g., LGB community connectedness) that may mitigate the negative effects of structural stigma on HIV outcomes. In the final phase of the project, we will conduct qualitative interviews with 30 key informants and 30 GBM. We will use data from these interviews, together with the quantitative results, to inform the development of multi-level HIV intervention strategies that are maximally responsive to the structural conditions in which GBM are embedded. We have assembled a team of experts in structural stigma, HIV prevention among GBM, qualitative research, and survey research with nationally representative samples to address our study aims. This project stands to make important contributions to research on reducing disparities in the incidence of HIV infections among GBM, identified as a high NIH HIV/AIDS research priority."
"9457680","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to identify genes important to schizophrenia. In the first cycle of our project, we demonstrated that damaging de novo mutations in persons with schizophrenia, from otherwise healthy families, disrupt genes that are co-expressed in the dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex during fetal development. Compared to their unaffected siblings, schizophrenia patients were significantly more likely to harbor such alleles. Proteins encoded by these genes functioned in neuronal migration, synaptic transmission, signaling, and transcriptional regulation. Integration of genetic data and expression data suggested possible schizophrenia-related processes and even potential targets for treatment. In the next cycle of our project, we ask whether these and other candidate genes are enriched for severe mutations in schizophrenia, by comparing mutation profiles of each gene for all cases and controls in the NIMH repository. In Aim 1, we will select ~500 candidate genes from among those with de novo damaging mutations in schizophrenia or autism, using network analytic tools to suggest those genes most likely to be causal and to identify other candidate genes. In a preliminary study, we show that an expanded network seeded by the 54 genes with damaging de novo mutations in our cases is significantly enriched for genes involved in chromatin modification and synaptic function, and for genes with de novo mutations in schizophrenia or autism from other studies. In Aim 2, we will sequence 500 candidate genes in DNA from all European American and African American schizophrenia cases and controls from the NIMH repository, ~12,000 subjects total. For each gene, we will sequence coding regions, UTRs, and non-coding potential regulatory regions. We will compare distributions of damaging alleles of cases and controls gene-by-gene and by network-defined functional groups. In a preliminary study, we identified novel truncating mutations in 3 different genes, each in one of 24 patients sequenced for 281 genes from a co-expression network. We use a method of pre-capture pooling and hybridization that yields a sequencing cost per complete gene per sample of 13 cents. In Aim 3, we will use C. elegans to characterize the roles of schizophrenia candidate genes in neurodevelopment. In candidate genes with orthologs in C. elegans, we will measure the consequences of RNAi-reduced expression on neurological phenotypes, including defects in axon guidance, dendritic branching, or neurotransmitter-specific neuron function. Then, for selected human mutations, we will create transgenic animals to examine the consequences of replacing the C. elegans gene with the human mutant vs normal gene. Together, these aims are designed to identify genes or clusters of genes important to schizophrenia."
"9385847","PROJECT SUMMARY Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality and disability worldwide. Even in patients treated with optimized standard-of-care regimens, residual morbidity and mortality remain high. New strategies that directly target atherosclerosis?the main cause of CVD?are urgently needed. One innovative approach is to find drugs that target the molecular dysfunctions that drive inflammation in human inflammatory cells. Systems genetics is a new approach that models molecular dysfunctions of complex traits like CVD in the form of gene networks. Combined with network-driven computational approaches to repurpose existing drugs targeting networks in complex diseases, systems genetics can speed up the discovery of powerful strategies to treat CVD. Using our systems biology analysis pipeline to analyze time-of- flight mass cytometry (CyTOF), and mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data, we identified specific immune signaling pathways and an inflammatory transcriptional signature in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Next we applied a rigorous combination of systems biology and computational drug repurposing analyses and we identified several compounds predicted to influence this immune signature. Preliminary phenotypic screening revealed that our top-hit compound strongly inhibit this immune response. Given these findings, we hypothesize that targeted compound will show anti-atherosclerotic efficacy. We propose to rigorously validate the pre-clinical efficacy of phase 2a-ready test compound, with the goal of translating the findings into human clinical trials. In specific Aim 1, we will test targeted compound ex-vivo in human PBMCs of CVD patients using CyTOF and in vivo in mice. In Specific Aim 2, we will measure the therapeutic efficacy of targeted-compound in vivo using translational pre-clinical imaging in a well-validated rabbit model of atherosclerosis that recapitulates the complexity of human atherosclerotic plaques better than mouse models. The use of sophisticated, non-invasive imaging modalities to measure the efficacy of targeted compound in a validated large animal model of atherosclerosis will provide robust evidence for the translation of our findings to clinical trials.  "
"9505022","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      The Clinical Research in ALS and related disorders for Therapy Development (CREATE) RDCRC will focus on ALS and a group of related degenerative disorders that includes PLS, HSP, PMA, and FTD. This group of disorders is unified by their degenerative nature; their overlapping phenotypes resulting from degeneration of upper motor neuron, lower motor neuron and frontotemporal neuronal systems; their overlapping genetic susceptibility; their shared underlying biology; and their uniform lack of effective therapies. These disorders also share common challenges with respect to biomarker and therapeutic development - challenges that might be overcome through a shared experimental approach. The over-arching goals of the CREATE RDCRC are to better understand the relationship between genotype and phenotype for this group of disorders, and to develop disease biomarkers with a view to facilitating drug discovery and therapeutic development for patients afflicted with one of these neurodegenerative disorders. The CREATE RDCRC brings together a multi-disciplinary group of investigators and a diverse array of patient advocacy groups representing the patient populations that are the focus of our research efforts. These include the ALS Association, the Muscular Dystrophy Association, the Spastic Paraplegia Foundation, the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration, the ALS Recovery Fund and PatientsLikeMe. The diversity of expertise within the CREATE RDCRC spans clinical neurology (neuromuscular disease and cognitive/behavioral neurology), genetics, genetic epidemiology, molecular neuroscience, biomarker development, drug discovery, biostatistics, and clinical trials, as well as patient advocacy, education and outreach. The CREATE Consortium, therefore, is a truly translational enterprise that effectively bridges the gap between basic scientists and investigators engaged in applied clinical research. Our new collaboration with the Ontario Brain Institute Neurodegenerative Disease Research Initiative, and the European STRENGTH Consortium significantly enhance the potential impact of this RDCRC."

"9305112","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Few natural host-parasite interactions have been highly characterized to date, even though the molecular mechanisms that determine parasite success or failure offer critical insights into immunity. We have developed a model system based on a coevolved host-parasite pair to analyze the reciprocal interactions underlying immunity in Drosophila melanogaster and the attack arsenals of its parasitic wasps (Leptopilina spp.). This system offers the complexity and subtlety to dissect innate immune activation, silencing, and subversion. D. melanogaster genetics are tractable, fast, and low-impact. Innate immune functions are widely conserved from fly to human and our long-term goal is to provide translational results. The most unique venom products of Leptopilina spp. are immunosuppressive microstructures, referred to as VLPs. Cell-specific drug delivery and therapeutic immune modulation represent two possible outcomes our investigations of the function of these unique parasite-derived particles. The protein composition of VLPs is central to the attack success of these parasites of Drosophila. This work marks the first functional investigation into a singular VLP protein. We have selected a gene product that is expressed only by the most virulent of Leptopilina wasps, is highly abundant in the VLP proteome, and possesses a putative site for GTP binding and hydrolysis. When analyzed in a genome-wide genetic interaction screen, this GTPase causes synthetic growth repression associated with impaired retrograde transport. In Aim 1, we will confirm these genetic interaction results and then test them in the context of GTP/GDP-locked mutants, as well as mutations that negatively impact normal vesicular trafficking. In Aim 2, we will express this protein in sub-populations of Drosophila blood cells to examine its subcellular localization and protein-protein interactions. We will test its impact on NF-?B-dependent signaling in fly larvae. The Toll- NF-?B pathway underlies activation of both the cellular and humoral arms of Drosophila's innate immune system and we believe that this GTPase-based modulation of retrograde transport may suppress normal immune signaling. The strategies utilized in this work depend on a paired model system approach. We have obtained preliminary information on the cellular function and targeting of a novel protein via a powerful yeast screen that provides information on thousands of genetic interactions. This approach has allowed us to design appropriate and efficient experimental plans in Drosophila. Our aims will provide the PI with in-depth skills in yeast and Drosophila genetics, transgenics, high-throughput genome-wide genetic screens, immunohistochemistry, and fluorescence imaging. This work will be strongly supported by a team that includes experts in the field in an interdisciplinary environment that will provide high-level training to the PI in immunity, multiple model system, genetics, and advanced molecular biology techniques."

"9383919","Project Summary The life of patients with Cystic fibrosis (CF) continues to be shortened by progressive lung disease. Recently, the development of specific small molecules that rescue mutation specific CFTR function have made remarkable impacts on patient care, but they are not available for many patients. In addition, ongoing airway inflammation may reduce their effectiveness, at least in some patients. In this context, TGF-b1, a cytokine associated with worse pulmonary outcome in CF, decreases airway surface liquid (ASL) volume in CF cells in vitro by impairing the function of calcium activated chloride channels (CaCCs) and the apical potassium channel BK, both crucial for maintaining ASL volume in CF. TGF-b1 also reduced mucociliary clearance in sheep. We therefore propose that airway inflammation in general and TGF-b1 in particular worsens mucociliary function in CF patients. If this hypothesis is correct, novel anti-inflammatory medications could improve CF outcomes in patients currently not eligible for CFTR recovery therapy on which we focus here, but might also improve the function of small molecules. Clinically used Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs) inhibit TGF-b signaling, independent of their angiotensin receptor blocking ability. Losartan, one widely used ARB, exerts these latter effects through one of its major metabolites, EXP3179. Thus, ARBs could present a ?fast track approach? for improving mucociliary dysfunction in CF. The preclinical, in vitro proof of concept aim 1 will test the hypothesis that losartan reverses the negative effects of TGF-b1 on CaCC and BK function (BK mainly through preventing decreases in LRRC26, the g regulatory subunit of BK required for its function in non- excitatory cells). Mechanisms of losartan's actions on CaCC and BK function will be explored using Ussing chambers as well as ASL volume and mucus transport measurements in fully differentiated airway epithelial cells from CF patients in the presence or absence of TGF-b1, losartan, and its metabolites EXP3174 and 3179. The preclinical, in vivo animal model aim 2 will test the hypothesis that inhaled or oral losartan improves CF- related mucociliary dysfunction in sheep induced by inhaled CFTRinh172 and human neutrophil elastase (HNE) or TGF-b1, which is downstream of HNE. We will measure tracheal mucus velocity, determine key pharmacokinetic parameters of losartan, and explore mechanisms that induce mucociliary dysfunction. Finally, the clinical in vivo aim 3 will test the hypothesis that oral losartan improves mucociliary dysfunction and decreases airway and systemic inflammation in CF patients who are not on small molecule treatment. The proposed experiments will test the ability of available anti-inflammatory medications, namely losartan and its metabolites, to improve parameters of mucociliary function in CF in vitro and in vivo and delineate their mode of action, thereby potentially identifying a ?low-hanging-fruit? intervention for CF airway inflammation."
"9319135","ABSTRACT ? AOIC Scientific Working Group  AIDS was first described as a clinical syndrome defined by opportunistic infections and cancer. As the AIDS  epidemic has been curtailed in the developed world by antiretroviral therapy (ART), a new epidemic has  emerged of HIV-infected patients succumbing to both AIDS-defining and non-AIDS-defining cancers due to  increased longevity. Furthermore, the ART era provides a new backdrop for the association between HIV and  co-infection with viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungi that can occupy new niches in immunocompromised or  immune-modified hosts. As such, there is an important need to identify the clinical and biological problems of  this new era and to bring researchers studying these co-morbidities together. In addition, HIV-associated co-  infections and cancers in the developing world are increasing at an alarming rate. Therefore, it is our  expectation that a Scientific Working Group (SWG) focusing on the interplay between HIV, co-infecting  pathogens and cancer will provide a forum to establish new collaborations and seed new ideas that would not  be provoked in traditional settings. The AIDS-associated Opportunistic Infections and Cancers (AOIC) SWG  was formed in 2012 through natural organization around strengths at Duke in microbiology, genetics, and  cancer. Five thematic subgroups include investigators with strong basic or clinical research programs in  molecular pathogenesis, genetics, or the epidemiology of infectious disease and cancer with a specific focus  on i) EBV lymphomas, ii) HPV-associated cancers, iii) HCV co-infection, iv) fungal pathogens, and v)  mycobacterial co-infection. The strength of the AOIC SWG relies on identifying cross-cutting technologies  and common research themes as high priority opportunities for discovery. These high priority opportunities  will be: i) international research in AIDS malignancy and co-infection, ii) genetics and genomics of host  susceptibility to infection, pathogen variation, and the development of cancer in HIV-infected individuals, and  iii) immune dysfunction that promotes susceptibility to co-infection and cancer. The overall goal of the Duke  CFAR is to maximize the impact of HIV/AIDS research contributions by Duke investigators on the global HIV  pandemic. The AOIC SWG contributes to this goal by bringing together and supporting investigators across  campus with an interest in AOIC-focused research. We will achieve this goal through the following two  complementary specific aims: i) to foster intra-CFAR and cross-institutional collaborations in AOIC-focused  research and ii) to develop new, high-impact scientific research programs in AOIC-focused research.   "
"9398343","Project Summary/Abstract  Human anaplasmosis, caused by the obligate intracellular bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilum, is one of the most common tick-borne diseases in the United States. In mammals and ticks, A. phagocytophilum resides in neutrophils and in salivary glands, respectively. Despite numerous studies that have focused on understanding strategies that A. phagocytophilum uses to survive in the mammalian cells, relatively few studies have clearly defined the molecular strategies that A. phagocytophilum uses to survive in ticks. In this project, we will be performing a comprehensive molecular analysis on Ixodes scapularis organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) and genes involved in the tryptophan metabolism pathway in A. phagocytophilum-tick interactions. This study is build upon our efforts in showing how A. phagocytophilum modulates gene expression and cell signaling for its survival in the vector. As an example, our previous studies has shown that A. phagocytophilum modulate tick antifreeze gene expression and actin phosphorylation for its survival in the vector. Here, we provide strong preliminary in vitro and in vivo data showing that A. phagocytophilum induces expression of a specific OATP (OATP4056) and kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT), a gene involved in the tryptophan pathway. We now hypothesize that interplay between OATP4056 and KAT not only facilitates A. phagocytophilum survival in the vector but also aid in the transmission of this bacterium to a vertebrate host. RNAi analysis revealed that knockdown of OATP4056 has no effect on A. phagocytophilum acquisition but affected its survival and transmission from these ticks. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with promoter region and total lysates prepared from uninfected and A. phagocytophilum-infected ticks provide further evidence that the presence of this bacterium influences expression of OATP4056 in these ticks. In addition, we found evidence that a metabolite from tryptophan pathway regulates A. phagocytophilum survival and OATP4056 gene expression in these ticks. These results provide important insights for our proposed studies to define molecular basis of the relationship of A. phagocytophilum with ticks. Based on our strong preliminary results and the experiments proposed, we believe that this could be a transformative study that not only serves as a model to study intimate relationships established by pathogens with their arthropod vectors but may also lead in the development of new strategies to interrupt the transmission of this and perhaps other Rickettsial species of medical importance."
"9358183","ABSTRACT Data from seminal studies on the functional roles of polyoma gene products along with recent results from cancer genomics have converged to highlight the multimeric enzyme protein phosphatase PP2A as an important tumor suppressor which is frequently mutated in a variety of human cancers. The overriding objective of the Functional Proteomics Core (FPC) is to provide state-of-the-art proteomic approaches for tandem affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry (TAP-MS) as well as quantitative proteomic/phosphoproteomic technologies. Data from these studies will advance our understanding of how ST/MT alter PP2A protein associations, as well as host cell signaling networks and protein expression profiles, ultimately contributing to cellular transformation and human cancers. The FPC will serve as a technical and intellectual resource where researchers within all Projects can collaborate, compare, and interpret their proteomic data within the context of human cancer. We will work collaboratively with Program members through two specific aims: Aim 1. Utilize tandem affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry (TAP-MS) to characterize ST/MT-mediated alterations in PP2A protein complexes. We will utilize our proven platform for TAP-MS platform to: (Project 2) quantify the dynamics of YAP-PP2A complexes as a function of ST or MT expression; (Project 3) compare protein binding partners of PP2A A? and PP2A A?; (Project 4) quantify changes in the assembly of PP2A-STRIPAK multi-component protein complexes as a function of ST expression. Aim 2. Utilize quantitative mass spectrometry to interrogate alterations in protein expression and PP2A-associated signaling cascades resulting from expression of ST/MT gene products. We will use our DEEP SEQ quantitative mass spectrometry platform to: (Project 1) identify signaling pathways influenced by expression of Merkel ST and determine whether these oppose or work synergistically with mTOR in the context of cellular proliferation and oncogenic transformation; (Project 2) quantify changes in PP2A signaling that result from ST/MT-mediated changes in YAP protein complexes; (Project 3) quantify perturbations in phosphorylation that result from ST/MT targeting of PP2A-A?; (Project 4) identify changes in phosphorylation sites associated with expression of SV40 ST or depletion of specific PP2A subunits. In addition we will work with Project 1 to interrogate alterations in protein expression resulting from MCPyV ST. These data will be integrated with the DeCaprio Lab?s RNA-seq results to prioritize metabolic regulators for further study. In addition our DEEP SEQ proteomic data may reveal transcription-independent mechanisms by which MCPyV ST commandeers cellular pathways."
"9358180","PROJECT SUMMARY  This application seeks the mechanisms underlying the roles of YAP/TAZ in cancer. A wide variety of human cancers have altered YAP/TAZ signaling that is generally connected to prognosis. YAP and its cousin TAZ are the major effectors of Hippo pathway that controls organ size, cell movement, proliferation and survival. This pathway also regulates other important signaling pathways (Hedgehog, Notch, TGF? and Wnt). We will use murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) to probe YAP function. MuPyV causes a broad range of tumors. Its study has illuminated the roles of tyrosine phosphorylation and PI3 kinase in cancer. It continues to point to important issues, such as the role of PP2A A? isoform, in cancer. Recently, we reported that MuPyV's small T antigen (ST) directly binds YAP and alters its phosphorylation, stability, and function by promoting its association with PP2A. This interaction allows ST to block differentiation in several systems. Extensive preliminary data on MT, the oncogene of MuPyV, show that MT also associates with YAP. This association is important for MT driven neoplastic transformation. MT also affects YAP phosphorylation, but MT's effects are different than those of ST. Our first aim is to study ST regulation of the differentiation of stem-like cells. Since we know that ST also interacts with TAZ, we will test whether it contributes to the phenotype. This aim will include a determination of the transcriptional mechanisms involved and the YAP effector protein associations that ST uses to achieve these alterations. Our second aim will be to study the roles of YAP in MT driven transformation. Here too we will be interested in changes in gene expression and protein-protein associations. In our last aim we seek to examine the roles of YAP in MuPyV MT mediated transformation in vivo using transgenic and knockout mice.  In the context of this Program Project, we have a great opportunity to exploit the virus interactions to gain a deeper insight into Hippo signaling in human oncogenesis. By comparing our results on the effects of MuPyV ST/MT on PP2A/YAP/TAZ with the results of our colleagues working with SV40 ST and Merkel ST and those of the Hahn lab working on YAP in K-Ras driven human cancers, we should be able to determine which of YAP's effects on cellular signaling are truly important, greatly enhancing the impact of our data. Ideally, these studies will lead us to our ultimate goal of translating our work into human cancer therapy, as we have previously done for PI3 kinase."
"9246316","Malaria and HIV/AIDS are two of the most devastating infectious diseases, impacting millions of people world- wide. Effective vaccines against the pathogens that cause these diseases (HIV and Plasmodium falciparum) have proven elusive and traditional vaccine approaches are unlikely to succeed in eradicating either disease. In addition to our limited understanding of the desired immune responses to confer protection against the pathogens and our limited ability to elicit such responses, vaccine efficacy is also confounded by the diversity of pathogens, human populations, environmental exposures, and health status. The projects described herein are designed to support the identification of immune profiles that correlate with vaccine efficacy and are of potential relevance to protection against HIV-1 and P. falciparum infection. Beyond the importance of combatting these diseases, the strategies for profiling immunity in response to infection and vaccination hold promise for garnering fundamental insights into the complexity of the immune system as a whole. Such insight will have potential for impacting strategies for vaccine development and for treating immune-related diseases more broadly."
"8114834","The Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is regulated by and involved in control of Ca cycling in the myocardium and has been implicated in transcriptional regulation leading to cardiac hypertrophy. CaMKIIdelta is the predominant cardiac isoform and splice variants lacking (delta-c) or containing (delta-B) a nuclear localization signal are both expressed in cardiomyocytes. The functional significance of the existence of both cytoplasmic (delta-c) and nuclear (delta-B) CaMKII subunits in the heart, and the nature of the Ca signals that activate them, remain unknown. The Ca involved in E-C coupling is released from the sarcopiasmic reticulum (SR), but cardiomyocytes also contain inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (InsP3) receptor regulated Ca stores. Ligands for receptors that activate  phospholipase C (PLC)-mediated InsP3 formation are established activators of hypertrophy, but a signaling role for InsP3 has not been demonstrated. We hypothesize that local Ca release from perinuclear InsP3 sensitive stores activates CaMKII and regulates gene expression and hypertrophy through effects on HDAC/MEF2 or other transcriptional pathways. Studies proposed in Aim #1 examine the effects of deletion of the type 2 and type 3 InsP3 receptor (InsP3Rs) or CaMKIIdelta on the development of physiological and pathological hypertrophy and failure induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAG) or agonist infusion, assessing changes in echocardiographic parameters, left ventricle to body weight ratio, ventricular myocyte size, gene expression and protein phosphorylation. In Aim #2 we determine whether localized Ca release from InsP3 sensitive Ca stores preferentially activates  nuclear CaMKIIdelta while stimuli that lead to global increases in cytosolic Ca via release from the SR activate the cytoplasmic CaMKIIdelta. CaMKII activation in these compartments and the activation of delta-B versus delta-c CaMKII will be examined by cell fractionation and immunoblotting, as well as by development of a FRET based CaMKII activity reporter (CaMKAR). In Aim #3 we examine a further corollary to this hypothesis i.e, that the nuclear vs. cytosolic localization of CaMKIIdelta targets different substrates. Proposed studies are directed at establishing whether there are distinct roles for nuclear and cytoplasmic CaMKII in activating MEF2/SRF gene expression, HDAC kinase activity, HDAC phosphorylation and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, versus in phosphorylation of RyR and other SR proteins. This hypothesis is also tested in vivo using mice in which delta-B and delta-c subunits are individually targeted for  knockout. Aim #4 considers an intriguing but unexplored possibility for feedback regulation i.e, in the ability of CaMKII to regulate both an InsP3 kinase and an InsP3 5' phosphatase involved in metabolism of InsP3. The possibility that CaMKII regulates these enzymes in cardiomyocytes will be examined by direct expression and phosphorylation assays, and by measuring InsP3 accumulation. Biochemical assays and a FRET based InsP3 sensor will be utilized to examine changes in InsP3 metabolism.  Aim #4 also uses these methods to compare agonist induced InsP3 formation in atrial versus ventricular cardiomyocytes and alterations that accompany heart failure, and considers the question of whether and how InsP3 levels increase in the nuclear compartment."
"9340066","Abstract:  We seek to understand the neuro-cellular, functional, and molecular mechanisms of age-related hearing loss (ARHL). This independent, yet inexplicably intertwined proposal is predicated on the initial compelling development and findings. In contrast to earlier reports, we found to our surprise latent neuronal degeneration of afferent spiral ganglion neuron (SGN)-hair cell (HC) synapses prior to any apparent manifestation of outer hair cell (HC) bundle disruption and HC loss, using a recognized and distinct ARHL mouse model. The mouse line has hearing characteristics similar to humans aging. We have also demonstrated functionally that the aging SGNs undergo step-wise reduction in membrane input resistance leading to reduced excitibility. Motivated by these exciting findings, we hypothesize that ?silent neuronal and synaptic degeneration? may be the preeminent target to alleviate ARHL.  We propose to determine the physiological neural mechanisms of ARHL and in close collaboration with Projects (P) 1 and 3 and Cores B-C (outlined in the overal theme of the project), identify candidate genes involved and demonstrate strategies necessary to counter the disease.  The overarching hypothesis of the proposal is that the aging sensory epithelia undergo structural changes that allow the high K+ endolymph to leak into the perilymph, triggering sensory-cell (HC and SGN) depolarization, increased intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) and subsequent ?latent? synaptic and neuronal degeneration. We further hypothesize that structural changes are mediated by weakening tight junctions (TJs) in the aging sensory epithelia. Claudin 9 and Occludin are identified TJ proteins in the cochlear sensory epithelium and will be used as a prototype to test our hypotheses.  Genetic mouse models carrying one allele of Cldn 9 and Ocln and doxycycline and light-mediated gene manipulations to test these hypotheses. The proposed studies will reveal critical neural mechanisms of ARHL and together with data derived from P1 and 3 and Cores B-C, new therapeutic targets for the treatment of ARHL will be assessed, tested and proposed. The results are likely to transform and shift the prevailing paradigm from descriptive to mechanistic and translational platforms."

Trainees are selected in a highly competitive process from students whose projects in mentors' laboratories provide training in molecular biophysics. While trainee selection is based on merit, the program is committed to enhancing diversity and has been very successful in recruiting and retaining members of underrepresented groups. Research strengths include x-ray crystallography, macromolecular NMR, molecular electron microscopy, a wide range of spectroscopic and microscopic techniques, single molecule methods, computational biophysics, membrane biophysics, protein folding, nucleic acid structure and ultrastructure, thermodynamics, kinetics and mechanistic enzymology. Supported students who complete the program publish an average of 4.5 papers from their thesis research, including many in high impact journals, and go on to successful careers in academia, industry, government agencies, and private organizations. The heavy involvement of institutions of the Texas Medical Center as well as the University of Texas Medical Branch ensures that students are involved in and exposed to research relevant to human health. The quantitative and interdisciplinary skills that are emphasized in the program are critical for advancing biomedical research and making breakthroughs in our understanding of human disease processes and in the design of new therapeutics and diagnostics."
"9315106","Skeletal muscle tissue is repaired and maintained for the lifetime of mammalian organisms but can be compromised by diseases and in aged individuals. The adult stem cell responsible for regenerating and main- taining skeletal muscle tissue is the rare satellite cell, comprising 2-4% of the total muscle nuclei. The satellite cell is named for its anatomical localization in skeletal muscle tissue, where these cells are typically quiescent and lie sandwiched between the plasma membrane of the myofiber and the basement membrane. When in- jured, the quiescent satellite cell responds by sequentially ?activating,? entering the cell cycle, proliferating as progenitors and then undergoing terminal differentiation and fusion to repair damaged myofibers or fusion with each other to form new myofibers. A small number of satellite cells self-renew, re-acquiring a quiescent state and re-occupying the satellite cell niche to provide continuous maintenance and repair. The severity of a muscle injury recruits satellite cells, which expand to repair the damage and then, return to pre-injury numbers once regeneration is completed. What signals are responsible for terminating satellite cell expansion during regeneration? When do satellite cells self-renew in vivo? How does the ?severity? of a muscle injury recruit sat- ellite cells? What mechanisms ensure that satellite cells are re-established at pre-injury numbers once regener- ation is complete? We have identified a cell-cell interaction between satellite cells and invading cells appearing between 4 days and 7 days following a muscle injury that appears to regulate satellite cell numbers. The num- bers of invading cells directly correlate with the severity of a muscle injury and thus, may regulate satellite cell numbers commensurate with injury severity. We posit that a cell non-autonomous response to a muscle injury conveys the extent of muscle damage directly to the expanding satellite cells, enabling the stem cells to appro- priately respond and ensuring the appropriate numbers of progenitors are available for repair and for self-re- newal to repopulate the stem cell pool. If confirmed, the cell non-autonomous regulation of the skeletal muscle stem cell pool represents a new paradigm for conveying the extent of tissue damage to a resident stem cell and will identify new therapeutic targets to manipulate satellite cell number and potentially improve cell transplan- tation as well as muscle regeneration."

"9307951","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Obesity affects 36% of US women and men and increases lifetime risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Similarly, depression affects 20% of US women and 13% of men and is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Further, the 2 disorders have a bidirectional positive relationship. Proven behavioral interventions to treat obesity and depression exist; however, the underlying biological mechanisms remain unknown. This lack of understanding significantly hampers efforts to optimize the effectiveness of behavioral interventions and limits their dissemination and implementation into widespread practice to curtail the adverse consequences of obesity and depression and promote population health. Rapid advances in human neuroscience and behavioral science and integration of the two could provide unique opportunity to fill this gap. Objective: Leveraging a recently funded 2-year randomized controlled trial (RAINBOW target n=404; PI Dr. Jun Ma) of a first-ever integrated treatment for comorbid obesity and depression in primary care that uniquely combines 2 nationally recognized behavioral interventions, we propose a 2-phased project to identify, validate and refine a set of assays to measure self-regulation targets; and to engage these targets to optimize behavioral treatment of obesity and depression. Specific Aims: In the UH2 phase, we will (1) Conduct secondary data analysis and hold workshops and a symposium to finalize selection of self-regulation targets and assays for testing; (2) Leverage the RAINBOW intervention to engage identified targets; and (3) Verify target engagement across multiple domains (neural, physiological, behavioral, psychological), settings (laboratory, virtual, and naturalistic), and time points (0, 4 weeks, 6, 12 and 24 months) Transitional milestones are to (1) Establish assay(s) that reliably and accurately measure the identified targets; (2) Demonstrate malleability of the self-regulation target(s) in response to th RAINBOW integrated treatment; and (3) Identify self-regulation profile(s) that predict treatment response in health behaviors (medical regimen adherence, physical activity, diet) and outcomes (weight, depression). In the UH3 phase, we will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial in which an additional 100 obese and depressed adults will be randomized to intervention or wait-list control and assessed at baseline, 4 weeks and 6 months. Intervention subjects will receive the first 4 weeks of the RAINBOW intervention, followed by target-guided tailoring of the intervention components in order to optimize target engagement and enhance behavioral change based on their individual self-regulation profile during the first 4 weeks. We will use the insights from intervention subjects to then further refine the tailoring strategies for the waitlis subjects. Implications: This research will provide a toolkit of well-validated assays of self-regulation targets important for health behavior change, as well as target- guided personalization of intervention strategies, in the treatment of comorbid obesity and depression. Impact: Given the widespread relevance of these disorders and the targeted health behaviors, this research will be a prototype for treating multiple chronic conditions with profound potential impacts on population health."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The extraordinary growth and specialization that has occurred in the sciences has made it difficult to link the increasing divide between clinical and basic science components of ophthalmic and vision sciences. Translational research has suffered as a consequence. The Harvard Department of Ophthalmology is one of the largest academic departments of Ophthalmology in the nation. With over 172 full-time clinical and basic science faculty members, it makes significant contributions to ophthalmic and vision research in virtually all basic, applied, and clinical subspecialty areas. The Harvard Department of Ophthalmology K12 program offers a customized and structured learning, research, and development environment to a select and diverse group of highly-qualified, clinically-trained candidates who have recently completed (or are about to complete) their training, but who desire further mentored learning experience so as to become independent clinical scientists in their respective fields. Scholar candidates in this program will (i) complete a core curriculum tha will include (a) the Harvard Program in Clinical Effectiveness - a summer-long immersion program in biostatistics and study design, (b) HBTM 305qc. The Molecular Bases of Eye Disease, a multidisciplinary survey course focusing on the cellular and molecular mechanisms of eye disease, (c) training in Responsible Conduct of Research and Bioethics, and (d) participation in Grant Writing courses. Scholars will also (ii) perform research in a closely mentored program under the guidance of lead mentors who are leaders in their respective fields. Trainees in this program will additionally have the option of seeking an advanced degree (MS, MPH, PhD, ScD) at Harvard. This is a competitive renewal application for the Harvard Ophthalmology K12 program, which has been very successful to date in meeting its benchmarks of recruiting and training top-notch clinician-scientists in a mentored environment. Since 2010, the program has received 44 inquiries, from which 16 were invited to complete the formal application process. Of these 16 applicants, five (31%) were accepted into the program. Scholars in the program have been highly productive in research, have completed or enrolled in degree programs, and received national academic and research awards and grants. Importantly, since the start of our program in 2004 all the Scholars who have completed the program have been awarded RO1 funding from NEI. We intend to enroll 4 scholars in the next renewal cycle (5 years) and each scholar will continue in the program for an estimated 3 years per the newly NEI-mandated 3-year cap per Scholar. The progress of Scholars is reported by the Program Director twice annually to the Program Advisory Committee and annually to the External Advisory Committee, comprised of leading vision and ophthalmic scientists and educators in our nation. Our aim is to build on our progress to date, and continue our training program for an additional 5 years."
"9240181","Project Summary Natural killer (NK) cells are a critical component of innate immunity and are cytolytic to tumor cells and viral- infected cells. Oncolytic herpes simplex virus 1 (oHSV), which has recently been approved by the FDA for the treatment of cancer, holds great potential in the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM), a highly lethal brain tumor. However, based on our previous studies, host NK cells provide a rapid and robust response following central nervous system (CNS) infection with oHSV, thus presenting a barrier for effective oncolytic virotherapy for GBM. Cytotoxic genes, including granzyme B (Gzmb), determine NK cell cytolytic activity in these settings; however, the molecular mechanisms responsible for regulating Gzmb expression are largely unknown. In this application, our preliminary data show that Smad4, a co-Smad protein in the TGF-beta superfamily signaling pathway, positively regulates Gzmb expression in a TGF-beta-independent manner, which correlates with decreased anti-tumor activity in mice with an NK-specific Smad4 deficiency. Using this mouse model, we also discovered that Smad4 positively regulates NK cell homeostasis and maturation by upregulating Blimp1, a positive regulator of NK cell maturation. Smad4 is also a co-Smad in bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. Our preliminary data support the hypothesis that the TGF-?-independent role of Smad4 in regulating NK cell function is downstream of BMP signaling, which has been reported to positively regulate NK cell function. Here, we propose to explore the mechanisms for this conceptually novel discovery and to modulate BMP-Smad4 signaling in NK cells in the setting of oncolytic virotherapy for GBM. Our overall hypothesis is that Smad4 positively regulates NK cell development and cytotoxicity against target cells including oHSV-infected GBM cells, and this can be modulated by temporarily inhibiting BMP-Smad4 signaling to enhance the efficacy of oHSV therapy. We propose an in-depth investigation into the molecular mechanisms whereby smad4 positively regulates Gzmb expression, cytotoxicity, and development of NK cells in mice using our aforementioned animal model and in humans using samples of patients with familial juvenile polyposis (FJP), having a germline loss-of-function mutation in Smad4. Additionally, we also propose to modulate BMP- Smad4 signaling to temporarily inhibit NK cell responses to oHSV to enhance its efficacy for the treatment of GBM. These are outlined in three Aims to test our hypothesis. Aim 1 is to dissect the mechanisms by which Smad4 positively regulates NK cell cytotoxicity against target cells. Aim 2 is to characterize the mechanisms by which Smad4 positively regulates NK cell development. Aim 3 is to temporarily inhibit BMP-Smad4 signaling in NK cells to improve oncolytic viral therapy for GBM in vitro and in vivo. We believe that the results of these studies will lend new insights into basic mechanisms of cytotoxic cell therapy and that exploration of novel therapeutics in preclinical models will advance the treatment of GBM."

"9303267","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ruthenium carbene-catalyzed ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) is a reliable and efficient method to synthesize well-defined polymers with relatively low polydispersities. These polymers, mostly synthesized from norbornenes and cyclopentadienes, are of wide-spread interest since diverse functionalities and architectures can be prepared. For pharmaceutical applications, chemotherapeutic or antibacterial agents are tethered to create bioactive polymers. An unexplored area is the design of functional medical devices based on the macroscopic or bulk properties of these polymers. Preliminary investigations revealed that large molecular weight polymers of poly(7-oxanorbornene-2 carboxylate) in aqueous solution were lubricious and can lubricate ex vivo osteoarthritic cartilage surfaces (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2013, 135, 4930-4933). Importantly, we have preliminary data demonstrating that these polymers: 1) function to lower the coefficients of friction in ex vivo bovine and human articular cartilage plug models compared to saline or hyaluronic acid viscosupplements (e.g. Synvisc-One(R)), and perform similar to healthy synovial fluid; 2) exhibit no in vitro or in vivo toxicity; and 3) resist degradation by hyaluronidase, therby enabling prolonged synovial joint residence time after intra-articular injection. Building on these results, we hypothesized that these polymers may have efficacy as a synthetic bio lubricant by reducing the friction and minimizing the wear between two cartilage surfaces. We propose the following three specific aims to support this hypothesis:  Aim 1: Determine the dependence of polymer architecture, molecular weight, rigidity, and charge on the  rheological and lubricating properties using both metal-on-metal and ex vivo bovine cartilage plug models  of articulating joint surfaces;  Aim 2: Determine the performance and lubrication mechanism of the bio lubricant in ex vivo healthy and  traumatized / osteoarthritic human metacarpal phalangeal joints (MCPJs; index finger) to evaluate function  in a discrete synovial joint; and  Aim 3: Determine the performance and chondroprotective capability of the biolubricant in vivo using a  trauma-induced osteoarthritis rabbit model. Successful completion of these studies will result in: 1) the development of structure-activity relationships and design requirements for highly effective biolubricants for cartilage surfaces; 2) insight as to mechanism of lubrication for these polymers in contact with articular cartilage vs. conventional metal surface; and 3) ex vivo and in vivo performance data in healthy and osteoarthritic cartilage joints. The next steps in the translation of this technology to the clinic will involve good manufacturing practice synthesis, a large animal model study of traumatic osteoarthritis, FDA required biocompatibility testing, and biodistribution/pharmacokinetic studies. The lead PI has previous experience and success in translating a polymeric medical device to the clinic."
"9358179","Summary  Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) is a clear cause of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), a highly lethal skin cancer. MCPyV encodes a small T antigen (ST) that is essential for MCC, capable of transforming cells and interacting with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). This Project will search for novel insights into the mechanisms by which MCPyV contributes to MCC. A critical barrier to our understanding of how MCPyV contributes to the development of MCC is the lack of appreciation of whether MCPyV T antigens differ in their transforming activities from the canonical SV40 and murine polyomavirus T antigens. A second critical barrier is whether MCPyV ST itself and its interaction with PP2A are required in the development of MCC. A third critical barrier to our understanding of how MCPyV T antigens contribute to oncogenesis is the uncertainty regarding the cell- of-origin for MCC. To address these goals we propose the following Aims.  Aim 1. Assess how MCPyV ST activates MTOR signaling pathways to promote transformation. The MTOR pathway is frequently activated in MCPyV-positive MCC. Furthermore, MTOR activation appears to contribute to survival of MCC tumors. Several reports have indicated that MCPyV ST can activate the MTOR downstream targets 4EBP1 and S6K although how it does this is not well understood. We have evidence that MCPyV ST induces expression of certain amino acid transporters. We propose that this effect contributes to activation of MTOR signaling especially during amino acid starvation. In addition, we have observed that MCPyV ST can specifically increase levels of lactate transporters reflecting an increase of intracellular lactate levels and may activate NF?B signaling. We will determine whether increased levels of the amino acid and lactate transporters contribute to MCPyV ST- mediated transformation.  Aim 2. Determine the mechanism of inhibition of double stranded DNA break repair by MCPyV ST. We have observed that MCPyV ST can inhibit double stranded DNA break (DSB) repair in response to ionizing radiation (IR). We have also observed that MCPyV ST specifically inhibits non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) by interfering with the activation of DNAPK. We will determine if the ability of MCPyV ST to inhibit DSB repair by perturbing DNAPK and NHEJ activity is linked to perturbation of PP2A. We will determine the specific role of PP2A that is required by MCPyV ST to inhibit DNAPK and NHEJ activation and if this newly described property of MCPyV ST contributes to its overall transforming functions.  Aim 3. Test the behavior of MCPyV T Antigens in Merkel cells. We have pursued isolation of primary human Merkel and precursor cells to determine if they are sensitive to transformation by MCPyV T antigens. We will establish an in vitro transformation system using Merkel cells or their precursors to test the role of the MCPyV T antigens in their natural background and clarify the specific oncogenic driver events required to generate an MCC tumor."
"9273555","Project II will test the hypothesis In developing rodent models that the underlying vulnerability, which contributes to SIDS, is determined by the Interaction between: 1) intrinsic ('pre-existing') deficiencies of the neurotransmitter 5-HT or the 14-3-3 family of regulatory proteins, both of which are abnormal In SIDS cases; and 2) certain prenatal exposures. The prenatal exposures are: a) intermittent hypoxia applied for 3 days at the gestational period of 5-HT neuron emergence, or b) during the first week of postnatal life when rodent pups are Immature (analogous to the last human trimester); c) maternal nicotine exposure; and d) maternal SSRl exposure. The first three prenatal exposures are strongly related to SIDS by epidemiology; the third, maternal SSRIs, less so, but Is of critical interest because of their relatively common use and their effects on 5-HT. We will apply three models of intrinsic brainstem 5-HT deficiency: 1) transgenic mouse pups expressing a novel receptor on 5-HT transporter-positive neurons resulting In llgand-lnducible and reversible suppression of action potential firing in all 5-HT neurons (Slc6a4-cre:RC::PDI), and In a discrete subset of 5- HT neurons derived from rhombomere 5 (r5) (Project IV); 2) rat pups from dams fed a diet deficient in tryptophan, shown by us to result In a ~45% decrease in the pups' medullary 5-HT levels; and 3) inhibition of 14-3-3 protein by difopein, a protein Induced by focal Injection of a viral cDNA construct. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine whether the Interaction between a pre-existing deficiency and a prenatal exposure affects: a) cardiorespiratory responses to repeated bouts of hypoxia, which normally Induce long term facilitation of breathing and to more severe anoxia/asphyxia which result In prolonged apnea and Induce autoresuscitation; b) the laryngeal chemoreflex, which can Induce apnea, and menthol-mediated respiratory inhibition; and c) arousal responses to hypoxia and the development of sleep. In Specific Aim 2, we explore biomarkers that could be applied to Identify infants at risk. Including alterations in serum 5-HT and heart rate variability. In Specific Aim 3, we Investigate potential treatments. Including tryptophan supplementation and caffeine, a cardiorespiratory stimulant. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Project II focusses on physiological events In early development that could contribute to mortality In rodent models that by design mimic the combinations of: a) pathological abnormalities found In brainstems of SIDS cases; and b) 'prenatal' stresses defined by epidemiology. The relevance Is In defining mechanisms that link human neuropathology to physiological dysfunction that can cause death In an age-specific manner."

This function cannot be performed in individual laboratories. Whole genome sequencing is also evolving rapidly and constantly improving the read capabilities, number of samples per run and informatics capabilities. There is only limited number of facilities available worldwide with such capabilities to continue to innovate. Welcome Trust Sanger Institute (WTSI) is a leader in sequencing the human genome, contributing one third of all the sequences and has made numerous contributions to other large genomes, lead efforts to sequence pathogens and disease vectors and mouse RI strain genomes. WTSI is committed to continually appraising new sequencing technologies, using in-house testing wherever possible, and will use whatever future technology is most suitable and cost-effective for the applications demanded by the science pursued at the Institute. The purpose of Core D is to provide for comprehensive genomic sequence analyses by utilizing a state of the art `next generation' sequencing platform for both the sequencing of whole genome as well as all coding exons/miRNA genes and the identification and characterization of genome-wide rearrangements at base-pair resolution in samples detailed in Projects 1 , 2 and 4. We have also developed and standardized single cell or small cell number whole genome sequencing. To meet these goals, in Core D we will pursue the following specific aims: to perform whole genome sequencing to generate genome wide substitution, indel, CNA and rearrangement data and streamlined analysis pipeline from IFM/DFCI 2017 study samples (Sp Aim 1); and to generate a genome-wide rearrangement data at base-pair resolution from selected samples to explore genomic changes during MM evolution from diagnosis to relapse (Sp. Aim 2). The core will also utilize methods developed1 to make high efficiency libraries from minimal residual disease settings (100- 500 cells) for Project 4, to generate representative genome libraries from a few hundred cells. Further, the core will provide bioinformatics expertise in the management and analysis of data produced within the core to support the projects."
"9329293","PROJECT SUMMARY Aims: The goal of this study is to collect formative data to inform the development of a locally, culturally relevant module to integrate mental health prevention and promotion into maternal health services accessed by perinatal women in rural Mali, West Africa. Specifically, the study aims to: 1) qualitatively identify local mental health constructs; 2) examine local priorities and sources of care for mental health; and 3) review the literature of intervention content and delivery mechanisms for common perinatal mental disorders (CPMDs) in low and middle-income countries (LMIC). Significance: The perinatal period is defined as the antenatal period to one year postpartum. CPMDs are highly prevalent in LMICs, and have been shown to place children at increased risk for poorer physical and mental health outcomes. Limited research has been conducted to develop and evaluate prevention interventions for CPMDs within the context of antenatal care. In Mali, there is no official mental health policy, and mental health care services and providers are extremely limited. This research addresses Grand Challenges in Global Mental Health Goals, B, C, D, and E, and advances NIMH Strategic Aim 4 by developing innovative service delivery models to improve mental health. Approach: This study is embedded within a current NIH-Fogarty International Center (FIC) funded R21 project in Selingué, Mali (09/14- 08/16; a 12-month no cost extension will be requested). This study is informed by Patel?s model of the credibility gap, and the ethnomedical theory. Qualitative research methods are systematic and rigorous, particularly when measures do not exist, and will be utilized to gain in-depth understanding of mental health concepts. Aims 1-2 will be addressed with qualitative methods, including multiple interview techniques among perinatal women, non-specialist health workers (NSHWs), and mental health providers to identify local constructs and priorities for care, as well as observations of NSHWs home visits. Aim 1 will be analyzed using cultural salience analysis, the standard analytic technique for measuring shared beliefs as culture. Data from Aim 2 will be analyzed using ranked ordered logistic regression of priorities for care and thematic analysis. Aim 3 will be addressed through a literature review of intervention content and delivery mechanisms for CPMDs. Sources will include peer-reviewed literature and online manuals and toolkits in the field of maternal mental health. Fellowship Information: This study is the doctoral dissertation for Ms. Lasater, a current PhD student in the Department of International Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Ms. Lasater has chosen one primary sponsor, and four co-sponsors who have complementary expertise in the methods and topics of this project. The training plan is designed with mentorship, research, and intensive coursework to allow Ms. Lasater to develop expertise in qualitative research methods, and strong quantitative competencies to help her achieve her long-term goal of becoming a leading independent researcher in global mental health in sub-Saharan Africa."
"8112410","Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle}: FISHER. ARON B. PROJECT 5: Post-Translational Processing of Surfactant Protein C Michael F. Beers, M.D. University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine Project Leader Surafel Mulugeta, PhD University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine Co-Investigator Susan Guttentag, M.D. Children's Hospital of Phila. / U of PA School of Medicine Co-Investigator ABSTRACT Surfactant protein C (SP-C) is a 35 amino acid lung-specific hydrophobic peptide that enhances the biophysical activity of surfactant phospholipid. SP-C is synthesized as a 21 kD propeptide (proSP-C2-i) and post-translationally processed to yield the 3.7 kD surface active alveolar form via cleavage of NH2 and COOH flanking propeptides. Recently, the importance of SP-Cto lung health and disease has been underscored by observations that heterozygous expression of over 20 different mutations in the SP-C gene in humans is associated with chronic interstitial lung disease (ILD). The overall goal of this project is to extend well- established studies aimed at understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying SP-C biosynthesis and to assess the consequences of expression of a class of aggregation prone SP-C mutants associated withILD. The experimental approach involves both reductionist and integrative approaches to dissect out key elements in the targeting and post-translational processing of proSP-C2i in the secretory pathway. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypotheses that targeting of proSP-C to the regulated secretory pathway as an integral membrane protein is mediated by a PPDY motif within the NH2 flanking propedtide that modulates interactions with specific ligands and chaperones including W-W domains. These interactions will be studied both in situ using binding assays for recombinant proSP-C and in vitro utilizing proteomic analyses of co-immunoprecipitation products. Specific Aim 2 will extend studies directed at identification and characterization of proteases mediating processing cleavages of proSP-C. Candidate enzymes we have identified include aspartyl proteases Napsin A and Pepsinogen C that will be studied using in vitro translation and proteolysis of proSP-C integrated into membrane vesicles, in situ proteolysis using purified enzyme and recombinant proSP-C substrate, and siRNA approaches in cultured type 2 cells. In Specific Aim 3, mechanisms underlying cellular toxicity resulting from the expression of aggregating SP-C isoforms and the role of agents which modulate protein folding and cell function will be determined using well established in vitro models. These results will then be extended in vivo using transgenic expression of mutant SP-C constructs utilizing recently improved lung- and cell- specific promoter elements developed in our laboratory to create mice which express mutant SP-C precursors exclusively in alveolar type 2 cells.

"9460176","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The synthesis of proteins in synapto-dendritic domains is tightly regulated but in fragile X mental retardation (FXS) and related cases of autism, translation at dendrites is dysregulated due to the loss of at least one regulatory mechanism, the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). How this dysregulation of translation contributes to the clinical expression of impaired cognition in FXS and autism is unknown.  An important clue and departure point for formulating our central hypothesis is the fact that loss of FMRP promotes hyperexcitability of neural circuits through overstimulation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR). Group I mGluR-dependent responses increase neuronal excitability and are a necessary determinant of the gamma band (30-100 Hz) electrical oscillations that coordinate action potential discharge throughout the vast networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons that is the substrate for cognition.  Our central discoordination hypothesis is that dysregulated translation causes cognitive impairments in FXS and autism because dysregulated translation leads to exaggerated group I mGluR responses that produce inappropriately coordinated synchronization and desynchronization of the electrical activity in the networks of neurons that mediate cognitive information processing in the mammalian brain. This hypothesis is based on advances in the basic science of cognition and the recognition that abnormal neural synchrony is emerging as the core pathophysiology underlying cognitive impairments in mental disorders, including schizophrenia, depression, FXS, and autism. We propose to characterize neural synchrony and cognition in five mutant mouse models of dysregulated RNA translation. In three Specific Aims, we examine neural synchrony in mice lacking the FMRP gene Fmr1, mice lacking BC1 RNA, a second repressor of translation in the brain, and mice lacking both FMRP and BC1 RNA. To confirm that abnormalities arise from acute loss of translation repressors (as predicted by the discoordination hypothesis) and not due to developmental effects, we will use a conditional Fmr1 knockout mutant mouse model that has lost FMRP only in adulthood as well as an inducible knock-in Fmr1 mutant mouse model in which Fmr1 is restored in adulthood under experimental control. First, we investigate abnormalities in the cortical EEG of the mice and determine the dependence on group I mGluR, M1 and 5-HT2 signaling. Second, we investigate neural coordination abnormalities in hippocampus and their synapse-specific origins using linear arrays of electrodes and pharmacological manipulations. Third, we identify which abnormalities coincide with cognitive impairments in the mutant mice. It is our overall goal to determine how translational dysregulation contributes to associated abnormalities in neural synchrony and cognition in fragile X mental retardation and autism."
"9353409","ABSTRACT  Although dialysis is associated with excess morbidity but no survival advantage for many elderly patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), the elderly make up a substantial and growing proportion of the ESRD population, with rates of dialysis initiation among the elderly increasing by more than 50% in the last decade.  Elderly patients approaching ESRD who are engaged in shared, informed decision-making are more likely to make decisions about renal replacement therapy (RRT, i.e. dialysis, transplant, or conservative management) and end-of-life care that are consistent with their personal values?often resulting in preferences for less aggressive care (no dialysis) and greater utilization of conservative management (consisting of maximal medical management and palliative care titrated to optimize symptom control and quality of life). However, many elderly patients are not well informed of their options, reporting that dialysis is often presented to them more as a ?necessity? than as a ?choice? and frequently have unrealistic expectations about what dialysis can achieve.  Decision aids are important tools in improving shared, informed decision-making; however, there is no standard educational program for patients asked to make decisions about RRT. To enable elderly patients with ESRD, in particular, to make informed choices about RRT that are consistent with their personal values, there is a need for improved educational tools that present the full spectrum of RRT options, including their benefits and burdens for elderly patients with significant comorbid conditions.  To address this need, we propose to create tailored decision aids for elderly patients with ESRD by (1) using quantitative and qualitative data from a diverse sample of elderly patients and their surrogate decision makers at dialysis initiation and 6 and 12 months later to (2) iteratively redesign the conservative management section of an existing NIDDK-funded decision aid (PREPARED, which was developed without elderly patients or more recent literature about conservative management) and (3) pilot the redesigned decision aid among a convenience sample of elderly patients with advanced chronic kidney disease and their surrogates.  The findings of this research will lay the groundwork for a subsequent R01-equivalent application to fund a clinical trial to evaluate decision-making consistent with personal values, quality of life, and survival outcomes of elderly patients in the US using the redesigned PREPARED materials. Additionally, this work will maximize the effectiveness and reach of previously NIDDK-funded work that could be used for all patients approaching ESRD, ultimately improving truly informed decisions and, therefore, outcomes for elderly patients with ESRD."

"9270048","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lentiviruses, such as HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV, infect not only activated/dividing CD4+ T cells but also non-dividing cells such as macrophages, microglia (brain macrophages), and resting CD4+ T cells. The HIV-1 infected myeloid cells such as macrophages and microglia serve as long-living viral reservoirs that persistently produce viral progenies. Importantly, while HIV-1 rapidly replicates in activated CD4+ T cells, the viral production from HIV-1 infected macrophages is kinetically suppressed. More importantly, unlike HIV-1, HIV-2 and many SIV strains (i.e. SIVmn) are able to replicates rapidly even in macrophages, and this fast replication kinetics of HIV-2/SIVsm in macrophages is induced by a virally encoded protein, Vpx.  Cellular dNTPs are substrates of not only cellular DNA polymerases for chromosomal DNA replication but also DNA polymerases of various pathogens including HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). In 2004, we reported that nondividing human primary macrophages contain extremely low dNTP pools (20-40nM), while activated CD4+ T cells harbor much higher dNTP concentrations (2-5µM). We demonstrated that the low dNTP abundance is responsible for the suppressed replication kinetics of HIV-1 observed in macrophages, proposing that the limited dNTP availability is a nondividing cell specific metabolic restriction factor against HIV-1. In 2011, a new macrophage specific anti-HIV factor, SAMHD1, was identified, and this protein is dNTPase that hydrolyzes dNTP to dN and triphosphate. Vpx counteracts SAMHD1 and promotes HIV-2 replication in macrophages. Our work revealed that SAMHD1 is responsible for the low dNTP concentration of macrophages, and Vpx promotes HIV-2 replication kinetics in macrophages by elevating cellular dNTP levels and accelerating the reverse transcription step. In the previous funding period, we validated that Vpx reduces 1) the efficacy of nucleos(t)ide RT inhibitors in macrophages by elevating cellular dNTPs levels, and 2) HIV-1 recombination efficiency by limiting the kinetic-delay induced RT pausing and strand transfer in macrophages.  In this new funding period, we propose to reveal two new additional steps of HIV-1 life cycle that are affected by the SAMHD1-mediated cellular dNTP starvation, 1) HIV-1 DNA gap filling step of viral integration, and 2) endogenous reverse transcription of HIV-1 in macrophages, because these two steps also consume and require dNTPs. In addition, we propose to solve the structure of the full-length SAMHD1 protein, which is not currently available, by employing innovative approaches. Finally, we will also investigate the structure and function of the SAMHD1-like protein of C. elegans, which controls the host developmental processes as observed in the human SAMHD1 genetic defects (Aicardi Goutieres Syndrome). This renewal application will provide innovative insights that can specifically target HIV-1 infection to nondividing myeloid cells that serve as long living viral reservoirs and contribute to HIV-1 persistence."
"9358822","PROJECT SUMMARY Transplantation tolerance, a state in which immunosuppression can be stopped while grafts remain functional, is a major goal in the field to reduce the morbidity associated with long-term usage of immunosuppression. Tolerance can be spontaneously achieved in rare patients. However, a proportion of tolerant patients lose their grafts after years of tolerance, sometimes following episodes of infections, indicating that tolerance is not always robust and persistent. The goal of Project 1 has been to investigate the mechanisms underscoring tolerance when it is robust and durable. To address this question mechanistically, we used a mouse model of donor-specific transplantation tolerance that we consider robust because it withstands many inflammatory challenges, and tracked graft-reactive T cells using seeded TCR-Tg T cells, or using fluorescent pMHC Class I and Class II multimers to identify endogenous populations. We have found that robust tolerance depends on multiple redundant cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic (constraint of cell numbers, Tregs, engagement of PD-L1) mechanisms to control alloreactive T cells. In this model, infection with Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) 60 days after transplantation eroded the tolerance, in that elimination of single mechanisms of tolerance was sufficient to precipitate graft rejection after, but not before infection. Therefore, our programmatic research revealed that transplantation tolerance is not an all-or-none state but rather reflects a gradation of individual mechanisms of T cell tolerance, each of which may be sufficient to prevent rejection, but several of which together maintain a more robust tolerance. In this Competitive Renewal, we will concentrate on an important property of robust tolerance, namely its resilience, defined as the ability to ?spring back? after a period of stress. Indeed, Lm infection in tolerant hosts precipitated rejection in about 50% of the mice, but tolerance re-emerged when the inflammation subsided, and second donor-matched allografts were spontaneously accepted. This `memory of tolerance' that dominated over a memory of rejection was dependent on regulatory T cells (Tregs) and their suppression of the alloreactive conventional T cells (Tconv) that had not been deleted during the induction of tolerance. Analysis of tolerant Tconv before and after infection revealed 2 novel properties: programmed T cell-intrinsic dysfunction, and the preferential preservation of low avidity graft-reactive T cell clones. We hypothesize that these two features make Tconv more susceptible to regulation, and are thus critical for tolerance to be robust at initiation and to return after transient reactivation by inflammatory events. We propose two aims: Aim 1. To define the molecular characteristics and functional defects of T cell-intrinsic dysfunction; Aim 2. To assess the impact of controlling T cell `avidity maturation' in transplantation tolerance. We anticipate that the completion of these studies will provide insights into the mechanisms underscoring the resilience of tolerance and lead to the identification of new therapeutic approaches to promote or re-induce a state of transplantation tolerance that can persist through inflammatory challenges."

"8114780","Preclinical studies are uniform in demonstrating enlargement of small pre-existing collateral vessels in mice,  rats and rabbits following acute-onset hindlimb ischemia. In the presence of competent endothelial function,  improved collateral flow is sufficient to moderate hindlimb ischemia over the relatively short distances in these  animals. The response in humans, however, is different. While significant increases in clinical indices of  perfusion and exercise tolerance are uniformly observed in patients with intermittent claudication with  prompting stimuli (e.g., daily walking), this cannot be ascribed to improved collateral blood flow in many of the  clinical studies. Meaningful improvement in limb flow capacity requires extensive enlargement of these small  collateral vessels, far greater than observed in small mammals, to compensate for the high conductance that  normally supports flow to muscles at the long distances found in human legs. It is unknown whether the failure  to observe significant increases in collateral blood flow in claudicant patients involved in exercise programs  is due: 1) to an inability to develop sufficiently large collateral vessels due to an inadequate stimulus, or 2)  to an inability to respond to an adequate stimulus that would normally prompt meaningful vessel enlargement.  Further, it is unknown whether establishing a high arterial pressure (e.g., approximately 100 mmHg; increasing radial wall  stress) within the large tortuous collateral conduits is sufficient to minimize regression of the vessel, in the  absence of sustained arteriogenic stimuli that enlarged the collateral in the first place. Using a large mammal  with femoral artery occlusion, we will: a) provide a commanding stimulus for collateral enlargement by  increasing shear stress, using a unique arterial-venous shunt, and evaluate the competency of the  endothelium to support collateral enlargement after inducing endothelial dysfunction by feeding the pigs an  atherogenic diet, known to 'dull' endothelial responsiveness; b) assess the ability of exercise training to  reverse the documented consequences of the HFC diet; and c) determine whether establishing a high luminal  pressure is sufficient to retain large collateral vessels, once formed, in normal, atherogenic diet-fed, and  exercise trained pigs. Instrumented limb blood flow (iliac a.), collateral network images, collateral blood flow  (uspheres), in vitro function and morphology of collateral vessels, involvement of circulating vascular  precursor cells, and functional capacity of the animals will be determined. Our evaluation of large-vessel  collaterals should provide compelling evidence important in the management of claudicant patients with  single-level, large-vessel proximal vascular lesions."

"9295009","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of the proposed study is to identify novel genes and functional variants associated with diabetic nephropathy (DN) by conducting whole-exome sequencing, follow-up targeted sequencing, and replication studies among DN cases and controls of African and European ancestry. We will use next-generation technology to sequence the whole-exomes (including protein coding regions, exon flanking sequences, and small non-coding RNAs) of 300 African-American (AA) and 300 European-American (EA) Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) study participants. The 600 CRIC DN cases will include those with a history of T2D, reduced glomerular filtration rate, and elevated 24-hour urinary albumin excretion at the CRIC baseline examination, along with rapid progression of kidney function decline in up to 10-years follow-up. Controls will include 15,487 DN free ARIC study participants (4,199 AA and 11,288 EA) with existing whole- exome sequencing data (generated by the same sequencing platform, exome-capture, and protocol used for sequencing CRIC DN cases). State-of-the-art statistical methods will be used to test the association between genetic variants and DN in AA and EA participants, separately, and adjust for important confounding factors. We will conduct targeted sequencing of the 200 most significant genes with novel rare variants from aggregate analyses and genotype the 3,000 most significant novel low-frequency and common variants from single- marker analyses among the remaining 772 CRIC DN cases (398 AA and 374 EA). The associations between the novel variants and DN will be validated in verification study of all 1,372 CRIC DN cases (772 from targeted sequencing/genotyping + 600 from whole-exome sequencing) and 15,487 ARIC non-DN controls, stratified by race. The large sample of controls will allow us to conduct secondary analyses comparing DN cases to controls with T2D and no nephropathy to identify genes and variants related to the development of DN among T2D patients, controls with neither T2D nor nephropathy to identify genes and variants that may initiate T2D and promote kidney injury in healthy individuals, and controls with nephropathy but no T2D to identify genes and variants specific for DN. We will replicate the top 20 genes with novel rare variants and 100 novel low- frequency and common variants from the verification study among approximately 1,763 DN cases (1,195 AA and 568 EA) and 3,159 non-DN controls (1,614 AA and 1,545 EA) in race-stratified analyses. Replication samples will include CRIC Phase III study participants as well as participants with existing phenotype and whole-exome sequencing data from the T2D Genetic Exploration by Next-generation sequencing in multi- Ethnic Samples consortium, the Cohorts for Health and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology consortium, and the Women's Health Initiative Sequencing Project. The proposed work is timely, powerful, and cost- effective with great potential to pinpoint novel genomic mechanisms and functional variants related to DN."
"9340063","Abstract Development and utilization of aged and genetically engineered mouse models are crucial to understanding the roles of specific genes in age-related hearing loss (ARHL). We will require strain-specific aged (senescent) mice that are not available commercially and are produced at the NIA-supported facility at the NIH, http://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dab/aged-rodent-colonies-handbook. All projects and Core C within the proposed PPG makes extensive use of these aged mice, and utilize a variety of genetic approaches to study the role of several genes in the inner ear and auditory neural pathways. Indeed, the proposed PPG will require the use of diseased models that result in hearing loss in the aging auditory system. The purpose of the mouse core is to provide services for the establishment of a strain-specific aged mouse colony and the generation and management of gene-targeted and transgenic mice. Founder mice will be identified, bred, and maintained in an animal facility at UNR. Additionally, several mouse lines will be bred and aged and supplied for experiments proposed in all three projects and Core C. The Core will also be responsible for maintaining and distributing mouse lines to each individual project. This will provide the most cost effective sharing and utilization of the mouse models. In addition, the Core will also cryopreserve critical lines in case of an inadvertent loss. Finally, the Core will be a resource for other laboratories interested in mouse models of ARHL."
"9324970","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Liver transplantation is the second most common form of solid organ transplant with more than a quarter of listed patients expiring prior to receiving an organ. Developing a means to either stimulate liver regeneration or cultivate liver cells under tissue culture conditions could potentially abrogate the need for transplantation. While several groups have attempted to cultivate liver stem cells in the laboratory, robust conditions that could fulfill the current transplantation needs have yet to be developed. Our laboratory has made two recent discoveries that may be useful for the expansion of liver stem cells. First, we have found that changes in Hippo signaling can reprogram mature hepatocytes into cells displaying characteristics of bipotential liver progenitor cells. Hippo signaling has ben previously described as a potent growth regulator, but this finding suggests this pathway also confers increased plasticity upon differentiated cells. Secondly, we have developed culture conditions in which manipulation of Hippo signaling allows for long-term growth and enormous expansion of liver progenitors and reprogrammed hepatocytes. We propose to investigate the nature of these findings in three parts: 1) Utilize a novel Hippo reporter mouse line to determine whether endogenous Hippo activity can mark the elusive liver progenitor cell in situ. 2) Elucidate whether reprogrammed-hepatocytes contain bona fide stem cells as tested functionally in vitro and in vivo; and 3) Investigate the downstream mechanisms by which YAP reprograms hepatocytes. Completion of this project would elucidate the nature of the liver progenitor/stem cell compartment; and explore the plasticity of liver cell fate as a strategy to develop transplantable cells for transplantation."
"9354485","Project Summary/Abstract Beige adipocytes are an inducible form of thermogenic adipocytes that emerge in response to certain extrinsic stimuli, such as chronic cold exposure and burn injury (i.e., ?browning? of white fat), and contribute to systemic glucose homeostasis. Given its inducible nature and relevance to adult humans, beige adipocytes have gained much attention as a potential therapeutic target in type 2 diabetes. This proposal is inspired by the recent findings that human subcutaneous white adipose tissue adopts a robust browning phenotype following a severe burn injury and that human beige fat possesses high capacity to oxidize glucose, fatty acids, and branched-chain amino acids (BCAA). The current objective is to extend our understandings on the biological roles and developmental pathway of human beige adipocytes in response to burn injuries. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that the burn- induced beige fat functions as a ?metabolic sink? not only for glucose, fatty acids but also for BCAA, which contributes to the prevention of post-burn hyperglycemia. In Aim 2, we will characterize molecular signatures of the burn-induced beige adipocytes at single-cell resolution and determine its developmental pathway. Our findings will have a significant impact because by use of the ?burn model? we will determine the functional roles of WAT browning in the regulation of systemic glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance in humans. Our study will also develop the innovative concept that BAT is not simply a heat-generating organ but can also function as a metabolic sink for glucose, fatty acid, and BCAA."
"9312059","Project Summary.  During the last phase of this project, we developed new tools to discover mobile element insertions (MEIs) in human genomes on a population-scale and then used these tools to generate the final MEI call sets for the 1000 Genomes Project. During the next phase of this competitive renewal, we now propose to build upon these initial successes to perform MEI discovery on an even larger scale. In Aim 1 we propose to perform population-scale MEI discovery and analysis in collaboration with several large consortia. Through collaborations with the Simons Foundation Autism Consortium, the TOPMed project, and other projects, we will perform MEI discovery in ~94,000 genomes and exomes. These studies will allow us to examine the impact of MEIs on human traits and diseases on a much larger scale than has been examined previously. In Aim 2 we will study the full-length L1 (FL-L1) source elements that generate MEIs in humans. We will develop a comprehensive resource of FL-L1 elements using PacBio-based sequencing approaches. We will then use this resource to study how MEI genesis varies in diverse human genomes and populations. Finally, in Aim 3 we will leverage the unique resources that we will generate in Aims 1 and 2 of this project to study the rates of de novo MEI formation in families and extended pedigrees. These studies involve large resources of diverse families and pedigrees (including European, African American, East Asian, and Hispanic families and pedigrees), which also provides us with a unique opportunity to compare the relative rates of de novo MEI production across diverse populations. We hypothesize that MEI production rates will vary among diverse populations due to differences in FL-L1 source content. We will continue to test this hypothesis in Aim 3. This project will potentially have a sustained and significant impact on the human genetics community by facilitating MEI detection on a broad scale for the first time."

"9276991","Project Summary  This MIRA proposal focuses on two overlapping areas: stress response regulation and the functions of redox-based signaling in vivo. It is a fundamentally important problem how organisms detect and respond to different forms of stress. Much has been learned in this area but we still have a very incomplete understanding of how some stresses are detected, including reactive small molecules such as ROS. For many years my group has studied stress responses and aging in C. elegans, focusing on the Nrf2 transcription factor ortholog SKN-1. Nrf2 mediates a conserved detoxification response to reactive small molecules but has many additional functions, and is of great importance in health and disease. Working in C. elegans we have defined a number of aspects of SKN-1/Nrf2 regulation and functions, including its major role in longevity assurance.  We have recently uncovered an exciting mechanism of SKN-1/Nrf regulation that forms the basis for this new research direction. We find that SKN-1 and human Nrf2 are activated at the ER by a localized ROS signal that can derive from the ER, NOX enzyme activation induced by stress, or mitochondria. This signal induces sulfenylation of a single Cys within the kinase activation loop of the ER unfolded protein sensor IRE-1, resulting in acute inhibition of the IRE-1 unfolded protein response and activation of p38 signaling at IRE-1 through a second sulfenylation event. p38 signaling in turn activates SKN-1/Nrf2. Remarkably, other kinases of major interest (AKT, p70S6K, ROCK1) seem to be regulated through sulfenylation of the same Cys. The data reveal an unexpected IRE-1 function that is regulated by a redox switch, a major stress sensor for SKN- 1/Nrf2, and a possible rationale for how redox stress can affect so many cellular processes. They also suggest that the scope and functional versatility of Cys-based signaling are much wider than is generally appreciated.  In our proposed research we will continue to identify mechanisms of SKN-1/Nrf2 regulation and their functions in vivo, but will also cast our net wider in utilizing the advantages of C. elegans to explore mechanisms and functions of Cys redox signaling in the context of stress, growth, and other conditions. We will refine models for IRE-1 regulation of SKN-1/Nrf2 and its functions in vivo. We will also similarly study SKN- 1/Nrf2 regulation by the chaperone TRIC, another mechanism we have identified that may involve redox signaling, and build upon screening results to develop new models for SKN-1/Nrf2 regulation. Using mass spectrometry (MS), we will collaboratively identify C. elegans proteins that are Cys-sulfenylated under stress and growth conditions. We will investigate regulatory and in vivo implications of this modification for the kinases indicated above, and candidates chosen from our MS data. C. elegans will be ideal for this work because of the relative rapidity of Cas9/CRISPR genome editing, and phenotypic analyses. Our research will reveal stress-responsive regulatory mechanisms of fundamental interest, and take major steps towards identifying new mechanistic targets and functional implications of redox signaling in vivo."
"9316640","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is one of the leading causes of blindness in the United States and many other nations and is the leading cause of blindness in African Americans. Elevated intraocular pressure (ocular hypertension or OHT) is a major risk factor for developing POAG and the only modifiable risk factor at present. 4-7% of the United States population above age 40 has OHT. A major public health issue is how to apply the principles of patient- centered care and manage this large group of people in an effective and cost-effective manner. The OHTS carefully followed OHT participants for a median of 13 years. (OHTS Phase 1 and 2) This includes 279 participants who developed POAG during the study, the largest inception cohort of POAG patients ever described. We propose to re-examine all surviving OHTS participants at 20 years or more in 2015-2017 (OHTS Phase 3). We will determine the incidence and severity of POAG in the OHTS cohort and determine the frequency and severity of self-reported functional limitations associated with POAG. We will also develop a 20-year prediction model for stratifying OHT patients by their risk of developing POAG and, among those who developed POAG, a prediction model for the rate of visual field loss. OHTS Phase 3 will allow us to develop evidence-based, 20-year guidelines for the management of patients with OHT. This will aid patients and clinicians to make informed decisions about the appropriate frequency of examinations and tests and the benefit of early, preventative treatment. Informed decisions should improve outcomes, reduce costs and reduce patient and clinician burden."

"9512435","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preventing suicide is one of the great public health challenges facing the US health care system. People who seek emergency care in general hospitals for deliberate self-harm are at exceptionally high short-term risk of repeated self-harm and suicide. Yet only about one-half of these patients receive emergency mental health evaluations. Among self-harm patients who are discharged to the community, only one-half receive follow-up outpatient mental health care in the following month. The proposed study will inform efforts to address deficiencies in the emergency management of deliberate self-harm by testing whether access to each of the following five emergency services influences inpatient admission, timely outpatient mental health care, short- term risk of repeated self-harm and suicide: 1) suicide risk assessment and triage procedures, 2) routine use of safety plans, 3) an on-site discharge planner, 4) an on-site or on-call mental health specialist, and 5) availability o crisis mental health services.  The specific aims of the study are 1) to identify patient, hospital and service environment characteristics that influence access to these five emergency mental health services; 2) to determine whether access to each of these emergency mental health services influences inpatient admission, increases the likelihood of timely outpatient mental health follow-up care and reduces the short-term risk of deliberate self-harm and suicide, and 3) to understand qualitatively how these emergency mental health services operate in community practice.  We will address these aims by extracting a sample of over ten thousand privately and Medicaid insured deliberate self-harm patients from approximately 500 emergency departments. At each of the treating hospitals, we will survey emergency medical directors to determine the presence or absence of the five emergency department services. Additional information about the emergency departments will be available from the Statewide Emergency Department Databases, hospital information will be available from the American Hospital Association Annual Survey, and regional mental health service information will be available from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration surveys. Repeated deliberate self-harm will be assessed with administrative claims records and suicide will be determined by matching individual patients to the National Death Index. We will then use this patient, emergency department, hospital, and service environment information in propensity score adjusted models of the effects of the key emergency services on inpatient admission, follow-up outpatient mental health care, early repeated deliberate self-harm, and suicide. These issues will be examined in greater detail through qualitative interviews with key front line staff at selected emergency departments to probe how these services operate and what impedes their implementation in community practice. This new information will guide improvements in the emergency management of deliberate self-harm."

The goal of this project is to achieve conformance with Standard #4, Uniform Inspection Program, by developing self- assessment and quality assurance programs to be used by the local health departments and the FPP. With a part-time staff person, the FPP will have the resources necessary to devote to the development, review, pilot, and promotion of a self-assessment program for local health departments. The program will be utilized by local health departments to review inspection data with a focus on the frequency of identification of risk factor violations for foodborne disease. Too often the focus is on the number of inspections completed rather than the quality of inspections that can have the most impact on ensuring the violations that most often cause foodborne illness are identified and corrected. Local health department supervisors will use the program to work with staff to address any noted deficiencies. A quality assurance program will also be developed and used by the FPP to audit the local health department self-assessments to ensure that deficiencies are recognized and addressed by the local health departments. The FPP can assist local health departments in improving the uniformity of inspections by developing and providing this program for their use."

"8134151","The objective of Project 2 is to ascertain how chronic environmental stress in combination with unfavorable  genotypes via 2 new mechanistic pathways (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical [HPA] axis and oxidative  stress) affects BP reactivity to acute stress and development of preclinical cardiovascular disease (CVD).  The Project will study a cohort of 300 African Americans and 307 European Americans (mean age will be  25.5 yrs) who have been evaluated 14 times over a 17-year period. The continued follow-up of this cohort  will allow us to examine the cumulative effects of environmental stress, genotypes and their interaction on  the time course of the development of preclinical measures of CVD over a period of 22 years. Subjects will  have hemodynamic measures and indices of HPA axis and oxidative stress assessed prior to and  immediately following three acute laboratory challenges, as well as in the naturalistic field setting. Subjects  will also have measures of preclinical CVD evaluated. Two key genes in each of the HPA and oxidative  stress pathways will be assessed by a gene-wide approach with all variants within a candidate gene  considered jointly. In context of the recent evidence suggesting that activation of HPA axis and oxidative  stress play an important role in obesity related EH, we hypothesize that obesity will exacerbate the  activation of these two pathways which are elevated by chronic environmental stress. Specific aims of  Project 2 are to test the hypotheses that individuals from chronically stressful environments and/or with  unfavorable genotypes will exhibit greater increases over time in HPA axis and oxidative stress response to  acute stressors and chronic stress (i.e., natural environment assessment) and measures of preclinical CVD.  Possible moderating influences of obesity will also be examined. We will also test the hypotheses that  individuals with higher levels (when originally measured) and/or greater increases over time in HPA and  oxidative stress responses to acute stress will exhibit higher levels of BP reactivity and measures of  preclinical CVD.  The long term objective of Project 2 is to improve the understanding of the way stress contributes to the  development of EH. Findings will contribute to development of behavioral pharmacogenetic therapies which  will include lifestyle interventions and pharmaceutical therapies in which the role of stress is taken into  account. These efforts will result in more efficacious and personalized primary and secondary prevention  approaches of EH and its co-morbidities."
"9319142","Abstract ? Social and Behavioral Sciences Core (Core G)  The Duke University CFAR Social and Behavioral Sciences (SBS) Core (Core G) is the primary hub for  university-wide scientific consultation on the design and conduct of social and behavioral studies related to HIV  infection. In accordance with the overall mission for a CFAR, the SBS Core provides ?value-added? services to  enhance and expand interdisciplinary research on the social and behavioral determinants of HIV prevention  and treatment. In the most recent funding cycle, the Core served 126 unique research projects from 78  investigators at Duke and beyond, providing services related to grant submissions, research implementation,  networking, community collaboration, and mentorship of new investigators. In this application, we propose to  capitalize on our successes in the last six years, and to support investigators to develop their varied and  diverse independent research portfolios and improve the quality and breadth of research to address the global  HIV epidemic. We will pursue a more concerted focus on mental health and substance use, both as significant  barriers to HIV prevention, testing and care, and as important intervention targets to improve the quality of life  among people living with HIV. The SBS Core has four aims: 1) to use our expertise in mental health and  substance use, in collaboration with the Clinical Core, to build a strong base of innovative research that  advances HIV treatment and prevention both domestically and internationally; 2) to enhance the quality and  quantity of social and behavioral HIV/AIDS research at Duke, by providing scientific consultations throughout  the grant development and research process; 3) to build the individual and collective capacity of SBS  investigators at Duke and its international partners, by attracting and supporting new investigators, providing  mentorship and training, and facilitating networking both within Duke and between Duke and other CFARs; and  4) to enhance the reach and impact of Duke SBS studies by supporting collaborative community research and  assisting investigators in the dissemination of findings to the community and larger scientific arena. Our  activities will achieve these aims while targeting three high priority opportunities. First, we will take advantage  of opportunities to support investigators throughout the grant lifecycle, from inception to implementation to  dissemination. Second, we will build upon our interdisciplinary setting at Duke University to foster interactive  networking opportunities that build capacity and strengthen research teams. Third, we will expand the depth  and breadth of substance use and mental health research in the global context, by building upon our strong  international partnerships. By capitalizing on the strengths and expertise of Duke investigators, the Core will  help to promote research innovation that advances HIV science and practice, in order to prevent new  infections, increase engagement across the continuum of HIV care, and improve the lives of people living with  HIV/AIDS."

"9332149","As the HIV/AIDS research field embarks on an endeavor to cure HIV-1 infection, insight into the reservoirs that sustain viral persistence in the face of suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) is essential. Most of the focus has been on characterization of proviruses and viral outgrowth assays (VOA) using circulating CD4+ T-cells that may have limited ability to inform on the nature of the reservoirs in tissues and more importantly, the origin of the viruses that recrudesce upon ART interruption. Furthermore, these approaches do not reveal the potential contribution of non-CD4+ T-cells, such as tissue macrophages, to viral persistence and rebound. The timing and composition of rebounding viremia is likely to reflect the nature of the reservoir from which it originated and the quality of host antiviral immunity levied against it. Project 3 will assess viral reservoir activity prior to treatment interruption, as well as the composition of rebounding viremia, to gain insight into the virologic mechanisms whereby host antiviral immunity impacts viral rebound activity. Project 1 will provide longitudinal samples from completed and planned human therapeutic vaccine trials (BCN ATI, RISVAC03, BCN02 and AELIX003). The SIV macaque model (Project 2) will provide longitudinally sampled blood and tissues from ART-suppressed, RhCMVd10/SIV-vaccinated macaques after treatment interruption. Crucially, both projects allow the earliest sampling of rebounding viremia, which is most likely to reflect its origins in the reservoirs that persist under ART suppression. We hypothesize that immune responses in macaques elicited by RhCMVd10/SIV vaccination and in humans by a viral load ?data-informed? vaccine, impact viral reservoir activity and that this is manifest by an impact on time to viral rebound as well as activity and composition of the viral reservoir. To pursue this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: The objectives are to (i) evaluate the effect of therapeutic vaccination on viral reservoir activity, (ii) assess the effect of therapeutic vaccination on rebounding virus composition, and (iii) determine whether macrophage- tropic viruses present in rebounding viremia have a macrophage origin."

"9285829","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our goal is to investigate mechanisms responsible for chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) development so that strategies for safer, more effective allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) can be implemented. While work by us and others has revealed that B cells are key contributors to cGVHD pathogenesis, the immune mechanisms responsible for pathological B-cell activation remain undetermined. Also, how B cells mediate cGVHD remains unknown. Since immune reconstitution occurs in the setting of ubiquitous foreign antigen, ongoing removal of lymphocytes reactive to recipient tissues is imperative to achieve or maintain immune tolerance. In HCT patients, we previously discovered that excessive levels of a B- cell survival factor, B Cell Activating Factor (BAFF) is significantly associated with cGVHD development. Administration of B-cell specific antibody, rituximab, results in cGVHD amelioration, but only if robust recovery of a naïve B cell compartment occurs, corroborating the importance of B cell homeostasis for cGVHD aversion. In cGVHD patients B cells, we found that BAFF-associated pathways constitutively signal. Chronic GVHD B cells are in vivo activated and primed for survival, suggesting a failure of the BAFF deletional tolerance checkpoint. Our central hypothesis is that B cells, that are able to overcome immune tolerance mechanisms during immune recovery, mediate cGVHD pathobiology. Our more recent preliminary data suggest that in cGVHD, potentially pathological B cells have a lowered B Cell Receptor (BCR) signaling threshold. An increased BCR responsiveness to surrogate antigen was associated with increases in the proximal BCR molecule levels, B-cell linker protein (BLNK) and Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk). Chronic GVHD B cells were preferentially blocked by a small molecule inhibitor, revealing a mechanism underpinning aberrant B-cell activation in cGVHD and laying the foundation for our proposed clinical trials. Data also forward our corollary hypothesis that a lowered BCR signaling threshold in cGVHD patients may be due to excess BAFF. In this proposal we will utilize both murine models and human assays to test this hypothesis. We will also identify B cell subsets with disease-mediating function by testing how BAFF drives these B cells and whether aberrant B cells mediate T cell activation. Specifically, we aim to determine whether pathological B cells in cGVHD develop because of: 1) excess BAFF; 2) immediate Ag-responsiveness; and 3) failure of immune regulation by certain B cell subsets after HCT. This proposal includes co-investigator and B cell immunologist, Dr. Thomas Tedder, and co-investigators Drs. Rizzieri and Li along and their Duke clinical trial and statistical core facilities. When work is completed, we will have determined how and when BAFF-driven pathological B cells arise after HCT, so that targeted and preventative therapies can be effectively implemented in patients. Our long-term goal is to improve outcomes of patients with hematological malignancies and disorders with safe and effective allogeneic HCT."
"7755654","The nucleoside analog cytarabine (ara-C) has been the mainstay of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) chemotherapy for more than 40 years and is one of the most important drugs used to induce remission in patients with AML. A number of studies suggest that the intracellular concentration of its active metabolite, ara-CTP, varies widely among patients and in turn is associated with variability in clinical response. The objective of the current proposal is to determine the molecular basis of this variation in intracellular ara-CTP levels by identifying and evaluating the pharmacogenomic effect of genetic polymorphisms in key genes in the ara-C metabolic pathway, with the long-term goal of explaining the variability observed in treatment response and toxicity profile among AML patients receiving ara-C chemotherapy. The hypothesis of this research is that genetic polymorphisms in key genes in the ara-C metabolic pathway -specifically: deoxycytidine kinase (DCK, a rate limiting activating enzyme); 5'nucleotidase (NT5C2), deoxycytidine deaminase (CDA), and deoxycytidylate deaminase (DCTD) (3 main inactivating enzymes); human equilibrative nucleoside transporter (hENT1/ SLC29A1, ara-C uptake transporter); and ribonucleotide reductase (enzyme regulating intracellular dCTP pools, and consisting of RRM1 and RRM2 subunits) -form the molecular basis of the inter-patient variability observed in intracellular ara-CTP concentration and sensitivity to ara-C. This hypothesis is based on the observations that the above mentioned candidate genes have been shown by various in vitro and in vivo studies to be associated with the clinical response and/or sensitivity to ara-C and demonstrate a wide inter- patient variability in their expression. The specific aims of the proposed research are: 1) To identify and functionally characterize the coding genetic polymorphisms in key ara-C metabolic pathway genes in lymphoblast samples with European (CEPH) or African (YRI) ancestry; 2) To identify and characterize regulatory cis-genetic polymorphisms associated with mRNA expression of the candidate genes; and 3) To determine the association of functionally significant genetic polymorphisms in the candidate genes with clinical phenotypes such as candidate gene expression and ara-C sensitivity in diagnostic blasts, and intracellular ara- CTP levels and the extent of DNA synthesis inhibition in post ara-C treatment leukemic blasts from pediatric AML patients enrolled in the St. Jude AML2002 protocol. The use of CEPH and YRI samples will allow us to use HAPMAP genotype data and to study any ethnic differences in genotype frequencies and in candidate gene expression. The results from this study would also be applicable to other nucleoside analogs such as gemcitabine, decitabine, clofarabine, etc. that are metabolized by the same pathway. Understanding genetic variation in the key candidate genes involved in the metabolism of ara-C will provide us an opportunity to identify patients at increased risk of adverse reactions or decreased likelihood of response, based upon their genetic profile, which in future could help in dose optimization to reduce drug toxicity without compromising on efficacy. Relevance Statement: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the second most common childhood leukemia and has the worst outcome of all major childhood cancers. Ara-C is the main drug used in AML chemotherapy but the cellular levels of its active form, ara-CTP, vary widely among patients and in turn are associated with variability in clinical response to ara-C treatment. The proposed research seeks to explain this variability by studying the inherited genetic variation in key genes involved in ara-C metabolism and may, in future, help to optimize ara-C dosing based on patient genetics."
"9517404","Abstract  Benzylic amines are commonly found in current drug candidates and FDA approved drugs. The direct installation of a nitrogen into a benzylic C?H bond, generating a benzylic amine, would be significant as aromatics are ubiquitous in bioactive molecules. Additionally, direct functionalization of a prevalent C?H bond eliminates the need for pre-installed functionalities, eliminating synthetic overhead and accelerating drug-diversification. A highly site- and chemoselective, inexpensive first row transition metal-catalyzed benzylic C?H amination is proposed for the rapid diversification of topologically complex and functionally diverse molecules. The method will be optimized and the catalyst reactivity will be evaluated in a variety of common organic scaffolds used in drug design. Selectivity trends will be elaborated in more complex commercially available pharmaceuticals. Once reactivity and selectivity trends are established, the method will be used to diversify complex drug scaffolds and natural products. Nitrogen is abundant in pharmaceuticals and natural products, making nitrogen tolerance under the reaction conditions necessary to significantly broaden the applications of the proposed method. Bioactive molecules containing a tertiary amine or pyridine will undergo complexation to the quaternary salt, to quell unwanted side reactions from detrimental nitrogen binding to reaction intermediates in the benzylic C?H amination reaction. If the proposed research is achieved, many new small molecule drug candidates will be accessible in only one step from existing small molecules, pharmaceuticals, and natural products. Such a method would broadly impact human health and the field of medicine as rapid and inexpensive access to new drug candidates will be possible with an earth-abundant, non-toxic, first-row transition metal catalyst."
"9292340","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This MIRA grant proposal briefly summarizes the activities currently supported by two NIGMS grants and my vision for the evolution of this research over the next five years. The common theme that unifies this research is a unique combination of the development and application of new physical methods that can be broadly applied to the quantitative analysis of biological systems.  The long-term goals of GM27738 (Electrostatics and Dynamics in Proteins) are to develop spectroscopic methods for probing electric fields in proteins and to apply these methods to obtain quantitative information on fields and their effects on function at the active sites of several enzymes. We have led the development of vibrational Stark spectroscopy as a general approach to map these fields. Recent and continuing work emphasizes the connection between electrostatics and catalysis where we can, for the first time, estimate the electrostatic contribution to the catalytic proficiecy of enzymes. We also study dynamics in green fluorescent protein (GFP), which we began to study reasoning that the native chromophore could be used to probe solvation dynamics (time dependent electric fields) in proteins. Instead we discovered that GFP exhibits excited state proton transfer. Recent work emphasizes novel applications of split GFP where light-driven association and dissociation reactions have been discovered. We seek to understand the basic mechanism(s) of these processes and optimize them for optogenetic and imaging applications.  The long-term goals of GM069630 (Membrane Fusion and Dynamics Using Supported Bilayers) are to develop methods to probe the organization and dynamic reorganization of lipids and proteins in biological membranes and to apply these methods to problems of broad biological importance. Our lab has pioneered the development of model membrane architectures, along with imaging and analytical methods, that probe fundamental aspects of membrane organization and dynamics. We use these approaches to address open questions in three areas of current biological significance. (i) The mechanism of vesicle and enveloped viral membrane fusion is studied using model membrane architectures we developed as targets to precisely probe the steps of fusion at the single event level. (ii) The organization of lipids and membrane proteins are characterized with unprecedented lateral resolution using imaging mass spectrometry, emphasizing the correlated motion of lipid and protein components believed to be associated in rafts. (iii) A novel membrane interferometer has been designed with the ultimate goal of correlated measurements of integral membrane protein conformational changes by optical interferometry and electrical activity by electrophysiological methods. Each of these areas represents a major current challenge in membrane biophysics and biology."
"9463530","Despite decades of research, the morbidity and mortality of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) remain unchanged. An altered intestinal microbiome and intestinal inflammation may predispose prematures to NEC. Probiotics may protect the intestines from NEC, however, they have to be delivered in high numbers with repeated dosing for any effect. We have developed a novel, tunable delivery system in which Lactobacillus reuteri (Lr) administered in a protective biofilm on biocompatable microspheres provides persistent probiotic benefits from just a single dose, greatly reducing experimental NEC. Our long-term goal is to identify novel strategies to protect neonates from NEC. The current overall objective is to identify a novel probiotic-based therapy protective against experimental NEC. Our central hypothesis is that administering Lr in a biofilm state with biocompatible microspheres that can be loaded with beneficial luminal cargo significantly improves its ability to colonize the intestines, reduce intestinal inflammation, and decrease the incidence of NEC. The rationale is that identification of an optimal probiotic delivery system will lead to maximally beneficial treatment of NEC. Elucidating the attributes of Lr that prevent NEC will also provide insight into factors essential for NEC development. We will objectively test our central hypothesis by pursuing the following specific aims: 1) To determine the impact of our Lr formulation in protection of the intestines from NEC. 2) Tuning the beneficial activities (biofilm formation, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory  effects) of Lr to optimize our therapeutic formulation. 3) To determine whether tuning the properties of Lr alters its ability to protect the  intestines from NEC. Expected outcomes include identification of the most effective Lr delivery system to reduce NEC, and determination of the relative importance of anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial effects of Lr in protection from NEC. The significance is a better understanding of the effects of probiotics on protection of intestines, allowing the best design of clinical probiotic-based therapies for NEC. This will have a positive impact in terms of providing improved therapeutic interventions for patients at risk of developing NEC, in addition to fundamentally advancing our understanding of the mechanisms by which Lr exerts its beneficial intestinal effects. This research is innovative because it involves a novel probiotic formulation that: (i) requires only a single dose for beneficial effects on NEC and (ii) is a platform by which mechanisms of probiosis can be studied through targeted delivery of prebiotic substrates in well defined microspheres."
"9319240","PROJECT SUMMARY  Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLHCC) is an often-lethal disease affecting primarily children and young adults. The poor prognosis stems from both the lack of sensitive non-invasive diagnostic tests and the lack of a targeted systemic therapy. We have recently demonstrated a single, consistent deletion in one copy of chromosome 19 of FLHCC patients that results in a chimeric gene. This encodes a chimeric protein comprised of the amino terminal portion of the heat shock protein DNAJB1 fused to the active catalytic subunit of protein kinase A. This project will determine if this chimera is sufficient for transforming cells. It will then determine the extent of cellular changes upon induction of the chimera and begin to elucidate the pathways and mechanisms for these changes.  "
"9350385","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT While RNA-Seq experiments based on Second Generation Sequencing (SGS) short reads have enabled remarkable advances in our ability to analyze the transcriptome, a few fundamental problems remain unsolved due to the high complexity of the genome and the inability to identify combinatorial genomic events. Third Generation Sequencing (TGS), including PacBio sequencing and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) which provide much longer reads (1-100kb), has the potential to overcome these problems. However, the current high-cost and laborious strategy of only using PacBio data is not practical for mid-size labs. Hybrid sequencing (?Hybrid-Seq?), which integrates TGS and SGS data, has emerged as an approach to address the limitations associated with analysis of short SGS reads and the error rate of TGS reads. However, tools to analyze Hybrid- Seq transcriptome data are not currently available because the majority of methodological developments have focused on Hybrid-Seq genomic data. In order to improve our understanding of transcriptome complexity, we will develop a comprehensive Hybrid-Seq platform of novel statistical and computational methods to analyze TGS long reads with the aid of SGS short reads, and to identify gene isoforms, fusion transcripts and allele- specific expression (ASE). The proposed studies build on our published and preliminary work where we developed methods for error correction for TGS data and detection of novel gene isoforms, which were applied to Hybrid-Seq transcriptome data from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). In Aim 1, we will develop computational and statistical approaches to identify and quantify gene isoforms. In Aim 2, we will develop computational methods to discover fusion transcripts. In Aim 3, we will determine the haplotypes of gene alleles and quantify ASE using Hybrid-Seq data. The methods developed in this proposal will be integrated into a software platform for analysis of Hybrid-Seq transcriptome data. This user-friendly bioinformatics platform will have important positive impacts by providing an unprecedented opportunity for comprehensive transcriptome profiling, with broad applicability and higher resolution. In addition, these tools will enable more researchers to apply Hybrid-Seq to their transcriptome studies."
"9382106","Project Summary: Post-transplant diabetes (PTDM), a common diagnosis following kidney transplantation, is strongly associated with adverse outcomes and its pathophysiology is poorly understood. Adipose tissue produces multiple cytokines or adipokines involved in inflammation and glucose metabolism. In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), adipose tissue cytokine production is altered. We have shown that with loss of kidney function there is increased production of both inflammatory cytokines and adiponectin in adipose tissue with concurrent adiponectin resistance in peripheral muscle tissue. Our additional preliminary data indicate 1) TNF? levels are associated with PTDM, 2) patients who develop PTDM have increased mRNA expression of TNF? and lower adiponectin expression in visceral fat compared to those who do not develop PTDM, 3) in myoblast culture, TNF? blunts adiponectin derived glucose transport. Our theory is that adiponectin resistance plays a key role in impaired glucose uptake and insulin resistance in CKD. Moreover following kidney transplantation despite improvement in kidney function, there will be a residual imbalance in adiponectin resistance and adiponectin production among patients who develop PTDM. Our overall hypothesis for this study is that CKD mediated adipose tissue inflammation and ROS contribute to development of PTDM by promoting muscle and adipose tissue adiponectin resistance. Our study will investigate the role of inflammation and ROS on adiponectin resistance and also the adipose and muscle tissue metabolic phenotype of patients that develop PTDM in 2 aims: 1) To define mechanistic pathways by which uremia, inflammation and/or ROS promote adiponectin resistance in muscle and adipose cells we will; i) expose myocytes and adipocytes to uremia, inflammatory cytokines and ROS with and without adiponectin, ii) study adiponectin downstream effectors and function (glucose transport and ?-oxidation) following cytokine/uremia exposure, and iii) determine if an antioxidant/anti-inflammatory treatment mitigates adiponectin resistance in muscle/adipose cells exposed to cytokines/uremia. We will also conduct genetic modulation experiments by altering key proteins from the inflammatory pathway and antioxidant regulators in order to determine if we can reverse the metabolic phenotype induced by cytokine/uremia exposure; 2) To determine the phenotype of adipose and muscle tissue in patients that develop PTDM, we will i) study macrophage infiltration, ROS, and ER stress in adipose tissue of patients that develop PTDM compared to patients that do not, ii) study the metabolic profile of adipose tissue from PTDM patients, and iii)study muscle mitochondrial function and adiponectin pathway in patients that develop PTDM compared to patients that do not . This project will develop data to fill gaps in knowledge on tissue metabolic changes in CKD that influence glucose regulation and on dysregulatory mechanisms that contribute to PTDM. Insights gained from this study will facilitate subsequent research on novel therapeutic strategies to ameliorate metabolic complications post-kidney transplant."
"9360450","Addiction is a highly complex disease with risk factors that include genetic variants and differences in development, sex, and environment. The long term potential of precision medicine to improve drug treatment and prevention depends on gaining a much better understanding how genetics, drugs, brain cells, and neuronal circuitry interact to influence behavior. There are serious technical barriers that prevent researchers and clinicians from incorporating more powerful computational and predictive methods in addiction research. The purpose of the NIDA P30 Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome is to empower and train researchers supported by NIH, NIDA, NIAAA, and other federal and state institutions to use more quantitative and testable ways to analyze genetic, epigenetic, and the environmental factors that influence drug abuse risk and treatment. The Administrative Core manages relations among research cores, groups of users, trainees, and pilot program participants. The Transcriptome Informatics and Mechanisms research core assembles and analyzes hundreds of large genome (DNA) and transcriptome (RNA) datasets for experimental rodent (rat) models of addiction. The Systems Analytics and Modeling research core is using innovative systems genetics methods and machine learning methods to explore the linkage between DNA differences, environmental risks such as stress, and the differential risk of drug abuse and relapse. The Pilot core is catalyzing new collaborations among young investigator in the field of addiction research. In sum the Center is a national resource for more reproducible research in addiction. We are centralizing, archiving, distributing, analyzing and integrating high quality data, metadata, using open software systems in collaboration with many other teams of researchers.

"9309075","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The successful conduct of clinical trials requires an excellent collaboration between a Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC), a Data Coordinating Center (DCC), and the clinical sites where subjects are enrolled and followed. One would be hard pressed to find many examples of projects that succeeded in spite of poor relationships. However, developing successful collaborative relationships among diverse groups of individuals is a difficult and resource intensive process. The disproportionate amount of resources required to create de novo consortiums and cultivate new relationships is one limiting aspect of the common approach to conducting multi-center clinical trials. The Network of Excellence in Neuroscience Clinical Trials (NEXT) will provide common reusable resources that many clinical trials can leverage. This application requests funds to support the creation of a DCC at the University of Iowa. The DCC will support study design, data collection, data management, project management, clinical site monitoring, quality management, safety monitoring, and statistical aspects of the proposed trial. The specific aims of the DCC application are to: 1) Provide study design and statistical leadership; 2) Develop and maintain a web-based distributed data entry system with the capability to quickly, efficiently, and accurately randomize subjects and collect data generated by the studies conducted within the network; 3) Provide project management support for the studies conducted within the network; and 4) Provide access to study-wide and network information.  The DCC will provide a robust, standardized, and accessible infrastructure to facilitate rapid development and implementation of protocols for conducting clinical trials in neuroscience. Additionally, the proposed DCC infrastructure is explicitly designed to accommodate dynamically changing requirements that naturally occur in clinical trials (both planned and unplanned). The proposed DCC will provide more rapid evaluation of promising treatments in neuroscience, and will be a model that can be replicated across a number of studies and diseases."
"9291492","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past decade, the hypothesis that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a disorder of reduced long-range and increased local functional connectivity has been gaining traction. To date, however, there is no evidence of increased local functional connectivity in ASD. If, furthermore, ASD is indeed a disorder of functional connectivity, then similar abnormalities ought to manifest in both the social communication (core/defining) and the non-social communication (non-core/non-defining) domains of deficits. Whether this is the case, however, has never been systematically tested in one group of participants.  The objectives of the current proposal are to determine the nature of local and long-range functional connectivity abnormalities in ASD, the relationship between them, whether they are manifested similarly in both the core social and non-core non-social domains of ASD deficits, and their correlations with behavioral and structural measures. Our central hypotheses are that ASD is in fact a disorder of connectivity, and that reduced long-range and reduced, not increased, local functional connectivity are distributed, cortex-wide features of ASD, manifested in all domains of deficits. We further hypothesize that local and long-range functional connectivity are reduced proportionally to one another in ASD.  These hypotheses will be tested by investigating local and long-range functional connectivity in the social communication (Aim 1) and non-social (Aim 2) domains of deficits of ASD, and their correlation with the ASD phenotype (Aim 3). The proposed studies will take advantage of MEG's high spatial and temporal resolutions to examine functional connectivity in 45 ASD children, ages 8-12, and 45 matched typically developing children, as they perform tasks that tap into core social communication (face perception and speech processing) and non-core (executive control and auditory processing) domains of ASD deficits.  The proposed research is conceptually innovative because our hypothesis challenges the prevailing notion that local functional connectivity is increased in ASD, and further proposes a direct correlation between the reductions in local and long-range functional connectivity. Furthermore, it addresses multiple domains of deficits simultaneously in the same participants. The proposed research is analytically innovative because it uses novel analytical tools to study phase-amplitude cross-frequency coupling (a measure of local functional connectivity) non-invasively in cortical space. The proposed research is significant because (a) it will examine the nature of both local and long-range functional connectivity abnormalities in multiple domains of deficits simultaneously, (b) it will determine whether local and long-range functional connectivity abnormalities are directly correlated in ASD, (c) it will provide a novel approach for non-invasively measuring local functional connectivity in cortical space, (d) it will set the stage for developing novel functiona-connectivity based neurophysiological biomarkers for ASD, which have potential applications for treatment and early diagnosis."
"9332373","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K23 will support the career development of Emily R. Perito, MD, a pediatric hepatologist and gastroenterologist. Her goal is to be an independent clinical investigator focused on improving long-term outcomes in pediatric liver transplant recipients. Post-transplant metabolic syndrome (PTMS) is a major contributor to long-term morbidity and mortality after liver transplant in adults. In children after liver transplant, individual components of metabolic syndrome-including hypertension, dyslipidemia, and glucose intolerance-are more common than expected for age, gender, and degree of obesity. But their clustering as metabolic syndrome and their impact on long-term graft and patient health has not been studied. The goal of this research is to investigate risk factors for, consequences of, and strategies to treat PTMS in pediatric liver transplant recipients. The investigation focuses on two modifiable causes of PTMS: obesity and calcineurin- inhibitor toxicity. Calcineurin-inhibitors are the mainstay of maintenance immunosuppression after solid-organ transplant. Their side effects include hypertension, dyslipidemia, and glucose intolerance-but not obesity. With the support of this K23, Dr. Perito will establish two prospective cohorts of pediatric liver transplant recipient-a late post-transplant cohort in which she will study prevalent PTMS and its progression, and a pilot cohort followed from pre-transplant in which she will investigate incident PTMS. A baseline cross-sectional study of the late cohort will allow Dr. Perito to define the prevalence of PTMS and its association with early cardiovascular disease and NAFLD (Aim 1). This cohort will be followed prospectively to investigate the impact of calcineurin-inhibitor dose modifications on PTMS, early cardiovascular disease, and NAFLD (Aim 2). Dr. Perito will also follow a small pilot cohort of children from prior to liver transplant, to identify risk factors for new- onset pediatri PTMS (Aim 3). This pilot will focus on obesity and corticosteroid exposure, as well as calcineurin-inhibitor toxicity. These studies will guide future interventional research on screenin and management strategies to reduce PTMS-related morbidity in pediatric liver transplant recipients. Dr. Perito's mentoring team and training plan will facilitate this research and her career development. This award will provide Dr. Perito with additional training in: (1) advanced statistics and epidemiology; (2) the science of obesity, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome; (3) development and management of research cohorts; and (4) design of interventional studies. Dr. Philip Rosenthal, a pediatric hepatologist and clinical researcher, is the primary mentor. Dr. Robert Lustig, a pediatric endocrinologist, will provide expertise on metabolic syndrome. Dr. David Glidden, a biostatistician, will provide mentoring on longitudinal data analysis. Dr. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, a cardiovascular epidemiologist, will mentor on cardiovascular risk assessment in young adults. The multi-disciplinary expertise of this team will allow Dr. Perito to build a unique independent research program dedicated to improving long-term outcomes after pediatric liver transplant."
"9529964","Implementation of evidence-based practices (EBPs) within juvenile justice (JJ) settings has been limited.  Service delivery occurs within disconnected practice settings (e.g., parole/probation, drug treatment, public  health), with limited continuity of care. Effective strategies are needed for implementing EBPs to improve  service delivery to adolescents under juvenile justice supervision and promote sustainable changes across  large, multifaceted systems. The goal of the TRIALS initiative is to support implementation research that  improves the continuum of substance abuse and HIV/AIDS services for adolescents in the legal system. Our  research concept focuses on improving HIV/AIDS testing and referral within the JJ continuum. Using a  randomized cluster design, the effectiveness of Community-wide (CW) and Horizontal Cascading (HC)  implementation strategies will be compared. Both involve a Plan-Do-Study-Act approach that promotes change  at the community level through training, the use of Community Change Teams (CCT), and guidance from  external coaches. In the CW condition, JJ and other professionals (actively involved in overseeing and/or  providing services for juveniles) will be asked to collaborate with multiple substance use treatment provider  agencies within a specified community in the development of strategic plans to address gaps in the service  delivery continuum. These individuals will be invited to participate in CCT training and planning efforts.  Implementation of strategic plans will be allowed to proceed without additional coaching or implementation  intervention strategies. In the HC condition, along with JJ and other professionals actively involved in providing  services to juveniles, CCT membership will include a single treatment provider agency. The CCT will be tasked  with developing a ?prototype? for carrying out the strategic plan within the participating treatment provider  agency. Once implemented successfully, the prototype will serve as a model for systematic roll out to the other  providers in the community, with CCT members functioning as ?in-vivo? coaches. The research concept  involves random assignment of 40 clusters of providers (e.g., Community/county) to either the CW or HC study  condition. Using mixed-methods, data will be collected at the community, provider, staff, and client levels. The  degree to which implementation strategies, organizational readiness for change, and interagency collaboration  promote implementation, service, and client outcomes will be examined using multilevel analytic techniques. In  collaboration with the Texas Juvenile Justice Department, we have established an interdisciplinary team to  design meaningful studies that will identify implementation strategies that are viewed as valuable, acceptable,  feasible, and sustainable by the field."

All providers will be trained and patient outcomes will be tracked for 6 months post training. This data set will be compared to 6 months of historical data for the same provider group. Primary outcomes of this study will measure the participants' ability in obtain improved patient outcomes related to: 1) rate of same-day C-SSRS Screening; 2) rate of suicide being added to the problem list; 3) rate of same-day safety planning; 4) rate of same day C-SSRS Lifeline/Recent Completion; 5) rate of same-day Risk Assessment; 6) rate of acceptance and attendance to within-Institute referrals for post intervention patients who are offered the referral at the first visit; 7) and lower rates of documented suicide attempts. Ultimately, the development and successful testing of this product would provide the US health care system a novel technology to scale up a clinician's confidence and skill to better manage patients who identify as at-risk for suicide. Additionally, if effective, this product will have a direct impact on patient outcomes, a vital component to any training product that attempts to train health care professionals. The utility and scalability of the proposed product will move health care systems toward the goal of zero deaths from suicide consistent with the Zero suicide approach."
"9401957","Project summary Hospitals should do the sick no harm. That noted, modern day pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) are not healing milieus. Immediately upon admission to the PICU, the child?s daily routine and sleep patterns are replaced by a well-intended but not patient-centered PICU routine. Our interprofessional team believes that PICU care and environments can be modulated to sustain a young child?s circadian rhythm (CR) and support their physiological resilience and capacity to heal. The first step in our paradigm-changing program of research is to use the R21 mechanism to pilot-test RESTORE resilience (R2), a 7-item individualized CR-restoring bundle, in two separate PICUs using a pre- posttest design. Specifically, after PICU admission, parents will be interviewed to inform the creation of an individualized chronotherapeutic bundle to include (1) focused effort to replicate the child?s pre-hospitalization daily routine (bedtime/wake time, bedtime/arousal routine, nap time, feeding schedule, active periods) in the PICU, (2) cycled day-night lighting and modulation of sound to match the child?s routine, (3) minimal yet effective sedation using a nurse-implemented goal-directed sedation plan (RESTORE), (4) night fasting with bolus enteral daytime feedings, (5) early progressive exercise and mobility (PICU Up!), (6) continuity in nursing care, and (7) parent diaries. We believe that critically ill pediatric patients managed per RESTORE resilience will experience less disruption in circadian rhythm as evidenced by improved day and night rest-activity patterns than patients receiving usual care. Our primary outcome is the circadian activity ratio (daytime activity/total 24-hr activity). Secondary outcomes will include salivary melatonin levels; EEG slow-wave activity; R2 feasibility, adherence, and system barriers; levels of patient comfort: PICU days free of pain, agitation, delirium, iatrogenic withdrawal syndrome; PICU exposure to sedative medications (total dose and length of exposure); time to physiological stability (time on vasoactive medication, duration of mechanical ventilation, PICU and hospital lengths of stay); and parent perception of being well-cared-for. Results of this pilot study will be used to inform the design of an adequately powered multicenter randomized trial of RESTORE resilience."
"9226993","Project Summary This project concerns IL-4 receptor (IL-4R) reprogramming of antigen receptor (BCR) signaling in B cells. Much study of signaling in the past has focused on biochemical events triggered in naïve B cells by BCR engagement alone. This has led to identification of signalosome mediators that form the ?classical? signaling pathway and play an important role in B cell activation, but, the study of naïve B cells does not consider interactions among receptors that determine the ultimate outcome of stimulation. We have shown that prior exposure to IL-4 alters the nature of subsequent BCR signaling in normal and in malignant (CLL) B cells. Following IL-4 treatment, an ?alternate? pathway for BCR signaling is created that is completely signalosome-independent. The proposed study aims to identify the fundamental biochemical changes that are produced by IL-4 to establish the alternate pathway.  Lyn is absolutely required for alternate pathway signaling, whereas it has been known for years that Lyn is not required for classical pathway signaling. An early event that is completely specific for alternate pathway signaling is phosphorylation of PKC? by Lyn, which occurs only when BCR triggering follows IL-4 exposure in normal and malignant B cells. Curiously, levels of Lyn and PKC? are similar in naïve and IL-4- treated B cells, indicating that protein components that interact after BCR reprogramming are available in naïve B cells, yet signaling via the alternate pathway does not occur in naïve B cells, only in IL-4-exposed B cells. This means that something occurs after IL-4R engagement that alters the relationship of key signaling mediators in such a way that activities/interactions that did not occur previously, do so now. This provides a discrete system with which to determine molecular changes responsible for creating the alternate pathway. We will do this by examining Lyn phosphorylation of PKC?, using this as a key and unique signature of alternate pathway signaling. We will evaluate 2 principal possibilities: 1) Lyn or PKC? is changed, whereby Lyn substrate preference is altered such that PKC? is a more avid target vs PKC? efficiency as a Lyn src kinase substrate is altered, leading to Lyn-PKC? interaction and PKC? phosphorylation; or, 2) PKC? is translocated to a membrane site conducive to Lyn-directed phosphorylation leading to Lyn-PKC? interaction and PKC? phosphorylation. This proposal represents a new, molecular direction for an established line of study. The high reward in this study is a much deeper understanding of how B cells, including malignant B cells, actually become activated in the milieau of cytokines that are experienced physiologically and pathologically in vivo. The results of this study will point the way to further dissection of the mechanism responsible for alternate pathway signaling by determining whether the focus should be on changes in the nature of Lyn vs PKC?, or changes in PKC? location and translocation. This will reveal further insights into normal B cell activation as well as signaling in CLL cells."
"9208828","PROJECT SUMMARY The overall goal of the Small Animal Radiation Core (SARC) is to provide ?turn-key? animal housing and photon and proton radiation (including image-guided radiation) to tumors implanted into syngeneic mice as well as spontaneous, autocthonous tumors. Moreover, it will furnish accurate dosimetry and quality control necessary for successful completion of the studies proposed in Projects 2 and 3. A key feature of this Core is the centralization and standardization of services intended to minimize inter-animal variability in terms of immune system regulation and tumor response to radiation. We have devised a streamlined process for movement of animals from ordering (C57/Bl6) or procuring them from breeding (KPC pancreatic tumor model) to tumor radiation and back to housing until the animals are euthanized and tumors and tissues are harvested. At the center of this Core is a dedicated animal holding facility and a brand new renovated animal treatment room which will house and already available and established Small Animal Radiation Research Platform (SARRP) instrument from X-Strahl, Inc as well as dedicated proton Beam available in the Smilow Center for Translational Research (SCTR). The three main aims of this core are: Aim 1: To establish a dedicated housing suite with controlled environmental parameters. Aim 2: To deliver both Photon and Proton-based irradiation to mouse tumors in a conformal manner using the Small Animal Radiaiton Platform (SARRP) and available Proton Beam thereby avoiding radiation of normal tissues as much as possible. Aim 3: To develop precise dosimetry and quality-control analysis systems to ensure the prescribed dose was delivered to the target. The two co-Directors, Drs. Koumenis and Solberg, bring considerable expertise in small animal radiation as well as managing radiation facilities both at Penn and prior Institutions. Successful implementation of these services will provide the Project Leaders seamless and uniform treatment modalities and has the potential to serve as a model facility for other similar research efforts world-wide."

"9318436","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mouse models have provided many biologic insights and remain the most popular system in which to conduct skin disease research. However there are significant differences between the skin and immune systems of mice and humans. These differences are incompletely characterized, making it difficult to know if observations made in mice will hold true in humans. 90% of the therapies that cure cancer in mice and all Staph. Aureus vaccines developed in mice have failed in human trials. Research carried out on human cells and tissues could address this knowledge gap but there have been many barriers to conducting high quality human research. The past five years have seen a revolution in the development of human biobanks and powerful new analytic techniques that make high-quality human skin disease research accessible. The goals of this Center are 1) to accelerate human skin disease research by providing researchers at any institution with access to human specimens and cutting edge analytic techniques and 2) to bring new investigators into the field of human skin disease research. The research community potentially includes any individual wishing to carry out human skin disease research; we have included 24 projects from investigators who wish to utilize Center services. The Center is composed of an Administrative Core and three Resource Cores. The Administrative Core manages and oversees all activities of the Center and administers Outreach activities, including grants to encourage human skin disease research, a Center Portal to disseminate human research resources and a biennial International Conference on Human Skin Disease. The Human Tissues Biobank Core provides access to over 23,000 highly characterized consented patients and over 1.5 million banked pathologic specimens, both searchable by diagnosis, as well as to fresh human skin, purified cell populations from human skin and immunodeficient mice grafted with human skin and blood. The Next Generation Immunoanalysis Core provides access to cutting-edge cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF), which can evaluate 45 different markers in a single sample with no signal overlap, and to high throughput TCR sequencing (HTS) which allows one step comprehensive profiling of T cells in tissues and the ability to identify and track pathogenic T cell clones. The  Advanced Imaging & Nanostring Core provides access to tyramide-based six color immunostaining with spectral imaging and automated image analysis, which provides the equivalent of flow cytometry data on cell types in formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue sections. This core also provides NanoString analyses, the first technique that provides accurate quantitative RNA and DNA analyses of up to 800 targets in FFPE biopsies. Taken together, these two techniques allow comprehensive protein and gene expression profiling for the first time in FFPE samples. In summary, our center will provide access to cutting-edge biobanks and technologies to any researcher at any institution who wishes to carry out skin disease research using human cells and tissues with the goal of accelerating human skin disease research."
"9273135","Project Summary/Abstract The research in our laboratory centers on understanding signaling mechanisms in cell death and survival, inflammation, immune responses and pathogen infection, using I?B kinase (IKK) signaling network as a molecular probe to explore potential intervention of the signaling mechanisms for prevention and treatment of inflammatory and infectious diseases. Our goals for the next five years are: 1) understanding the molecular mechanism that controls TNF? cytotoxicity in inflammatory and infectious diseases. Previously, we reported that TNF?-induced apoptosis is suppressed by IKK-mediated inhibition of the pro- apoptotic BCL-2 family member BH3-only protein BAD in addition to activation of NF-?B under physiological or developmental conditions. Our unpublished results demonstrated that TNF? cytotoxicity in severe sepsis is mediated by massive BAD release from cytoskeleton despite concurrent activation of IKK and NF-?B. We plan to determine the underlying mechanism and its potential applications in other inflammatory and infectious diseases in which TNF? cytotoxicity plays a crucial role in disease pathologies; 2) computational modeling TNF? cytotoxicity. Our unpublished results demonstrated that IKK signaling network suppresses TNF?-induced apoptosis through coherent feedforward regulation. We plan to use computational modeling to explore how fundamental mathematics and physical sciences concepts have been applied to regulate TNF? cytotoxicity by IKK signaling network at systems level, thereby putting forward novel hypotheses beyond the empirical data for further testing; and 3) novel regulatory mechanism of non-canonical IKK-NF-?B network. Our unpublished results demonstrated that the transcription factor Miz1 is required for activation of non-canonical NF-?B by lymphotoxin (LT) and other stimuli independently of its transcriptional activity and Miz1-deficient mice display impaired clearance of Citrobactor rodentium infections. We plan to study the underlying mechanism and its role in mucosal immune responses against bacterial infection. The overall vision of the research program in our laboratory is to provide novel strategies and identify molecular targets for prevention and treatment of inflammatory and infectious human diseases."
"9396535","Project Summary/Abstract  Numerous pathogenic viruses utilize a lympho-hematogenous route of dissemination upon penetration of their natural host epithelial surfaces. These viruses replicate in the lymph nodes (LN) before spreading to distant organs, resulting in the induction of systemic disease. Ectromelia virus (ECTV) is widely utilized as the prototypical virus for studying lympho-hematogenous spreading. Understanding the mechanisms of viral dissemination and host immune-virus interactions is paramount to not only our understanding of how humans control the dissemination of their own natural pathogens but is critical for the advancement of vaccine development and efficacy. Work from our lab have supported the concept that LNs are not only sites that facilitate lymphocyte priming but also serve as principal sites where innate and adaptive cells curtail the systemic propagation of pathogens. We have recently demonstrated that inflammatory monocytes (iMo) rapidly migrate to the draining LN (dLN) after infection and play a critical role in curtailing viral replication and dissemination. They are the principal producers of type I interferon (T1-IFN) in the dLN and their accumulation to the dLN is dependent on extrinsic TLR9/MyD88 expression, specifically by CCL7/CCL2 producing CD11c+ cells. Our preliminary data indicates that these CD11c+ cells are skin-derived, migratory dendritic cells (skin- mDCs) from the skin of the footpad (the initial site of virus breach and infection). TLR9/MyD88 deficiency as well as localized pertussis toxin treatment ablates skin-mDC migration to the dLN, resulting in a concomitant decrease in iMo accumulation and higher viral replication, indicating an important role for viral sensing mechanisms intrinsic to these skin-mDCs. However, the mechanisms of viral transport from the initial site of infection to the dLN is not well defined and furthermore, the underlying mechanisms through which TLR9 and MyD88 control skin-mDC function is unknown. Therefore, the proposed research will aim to 1.) elucidate the skin-mDC-dependent and ?independent mechanisms governing viral transport as well as define the specific effector functions of the skin-mDC subsets during viral infection 2.) delineate the TLR9 and MyD88-intrinsic mechanisms that dictate skin-mDC migration and function. Overall, our experiments will contribute to the better understanding of the early anti-viral response in the skin to a pathogen that spreads lymphohematogenously in its natural host. This is especially critical given that the degree of effectiveness of the initial host response plays an important role in dictating the efficacy of the entire host response. This will help contribute to a better understanding of how humans control the dissemination of their own natural pathogens."
"9357685","Summary Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are among the most clinically defined but least understood psychiatric disorders. We have uncovered a novel pathway of stress regulation in the brain mediated by the master transcriptional repressor REST/NRSF. Our preliminary studies suggest that the REST pathway may be dysregulated in the brains of patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and that treating bipolar patients with lithium, a drug that activates REST, restores homeostasis. This project will address a novel conceptual paradigm that might underlie both disorders involving dysregulation of a stress response system in the brain that is regulated by REST. Initially, we will determine if REST function is altered in neurons derived from induced progenitor stem (iPS) cells of patients and in isogenic iPS cell lines in which we have introduced a schizophrenia-causing genetic variant using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. We will then determine if conditional knockout mouse models of REST dysfunction in specific neuronal subpopulations recapitulate behavioral, metabolic and physiological changes associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Finally, we will define transcriptome changes in the brains of schizophrenic and bipolar patients at single neuron resolution to ascertain the role of REST and other transcriptional regulators in specific neuronal cell types. To accomplish this goal, we will advance a new technology we have recently developed called fluorescence in situ sequencing of RNA (FISSEQ). In contrast to conventional sequencing, which requires isolation of DNA or RNA, FISSEQ sequences RNA in intact tissue, bringing together the depth of transcriptome-wide RNA sequencing with the resolution of single molecule in situ RNA localization. FISSEQ can also be multiplexed with other data streams, particularly proteomics, enabling multidimensional interrogation at single cell resolution. FISSEQ will be used to derive reference transcriptomes for identified neural cell types in the human and mouse brain. Differences between reference transcriptomes and transcriptomes of patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder may implicate REST or other transcription factors, and provide a systems- level view of the central regulatory pathways. This will be complemented by transcriptome analysis in mice genetically engineered to delete or overexpress the REST gene in specific neuronal populations. Although this approach will be used to explore psychiatric disorders, once developed, it could be rapidly employed to elucidate altered genome regulation in any brain disorder. These studies will bring together two principal investigators with complementary areas of expertise in a multidisciplinary approach to understand psychiatric disorders and advance single cell transcriptome analysis of the brain."
"9268457","DESCRIPTION     This project focuses on fatigue, an extremely common yet poorly understood complaint in patients affected by multiple sclerosis (MS).  Primary fatigue, is fatigue not secondary to other MS-associated symptoms (e.g., sleep disorder or depression), is a distinct clinical entity and a cause of severe disability in most patients. A s fatigue limits everyday activities and it interfers with exercise-based rehabilitation, understanding its mechanisms is crucial to improving function and quality of life of Veterans with MS.  Primary fatigue is divided in two broad categories, mental (cognitive) and physical (motor) fatigue, the latter being the focus of this proposal.  Evidence suggests that primary motor fatigue originates within the central nervous system (CNS) but, although several factors have been invoked (e.g., demyelination, axonal loss, inflammation), a neurophysiological model to explain its underlying mechanisms is still lacking.  First, with this project, we propose a characteristic eye movement abnormality, internuclear ophthalmoparesis (INO), as a simple and accessible model for primary motor fatigue in MS.  INO is a disorder of binocular coordination (conjugacy), in which fast eye movements (saccades) of the adducting eye (i.e., the eye moving towards the nose) are slow during horizontal gaze shifts, due to demyelination of a specific CNS pathway (the medial longitudinal fasciculus, MLF).  Preliminary results in a small MS group of patients show that patients with INO exhibit changes in ocular conjugacy (i.e., ocular motor fatigue) during a 10-minute saccadic fatigue test, but normal subjects do not.  We hypothesize that ocular motor fatigue is representative of a major component of primary motor fatigue in MS, as it likely reflects deterioration of neural conduction fidelity along the demyelinated MLF axons.  We aim at showing that ocular motor fatigue occurs in a larger MS population with INO by measuring changes of binocular conjugacy on eye movement recordings using two main measures: 1) abducting/adducting eye ratio for saccadic peak velocity (pulse size ratio); 2) time difference in occurrence of peak acceleration in the adducting vs. the abducting eye (pulse time delay), during the 10-minute fatigue test.  We will determine whether ocular motor fatigue is associated with symptomatic subjective fatigue as assessed with standard fatigue questionnaires. Second, we intend to test efficacy of dalfampridine, a potassium channel blocker that enhances neural conduction along demyelinated axons, in MS patients with INO with or without associated ocular motor fatigue. Visual dysfunction in MS patients with INO is a major cause of disability as they are severely limited in daily activities such as driving and can suffer further disability when developing ocular motor fatigue during a sustained visual task (e.g., reading).  However, no medical therapy is available for INO/ocular motor fatigue.  Our preliminary results document improved binocular conjugacy in three MS patients taking dalfampridine for gait impairment (the FDA-approved indication for this medication).  Our data also showed improvement of ocular motor fatigue after dalfampridine in one patient. We hypothesize that dalfampridine improves visual performance in MS patients with INO and counteracts ocular motor fatigue and, in turn, diminishes visual disability and improves quality of life.  Thus, we will conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial of dalfampridine (10mg twice a day) of 9 weeks duration.  Before and after treatment, we will assess for changes in binocular conjugacy by eye movement measures as above, as well as changes in clinical measures, such as reading acuity and speed, saccades performance, gait performance, symptomatic fatigue, visual disability and quality of life.  We will determine whether improvement of visual performance has positive effects on overall disability and quality of life of MS patients with INO.  We will also determine whether there is an association between response of eye movement and gait performances to dalfampridine."
"9314855","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our objective is to use HCP protocols to acquire and make public a large dataset of imaging, behavioral, and symptom data from patients with disordered emotional states. We will also develop and make public new methods for examining how connectome disorganization gives rise to these disordered states at the level of the individual patient. Psychopathology arising from enhanced negative emotion or from the loss of positive emotional experience affects over 400 million people globally. Such states of disordered emotion cut across multiple diagnostic categories and are compounded by accompanying disruptions in cognitive function. Not surprisingly, therefore, these forms of psychopathology are a leading cause of disability. To address these issues our investigative strategy is informed by the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative spearheaded by NIMH. We focus on three RDoC domains and constructs: 1) acute threat within the Negative Valence System (NVS) domain, a construct relevant to automatic reactions to fear and physical symptoms of anxiety; 2) reward valuation and responsiveness within the Positive Valence System (PVS) domain, a construct involving incentive salience, hedonic responses and symptoms of anhedonia; and 3) working memory within the Cognitive System (CS) domain, a construct that implicates top-down regulation of cognitive rumination and worry. Our approach is grounded in strict adherence to HPC protocols and a strong commitment to data sharing. We unite complementary expertise, including (1) state-of-the-art MRI technology and data management systems; (2) a field-leading Center for Reproducible Neuroscience; (3) a track record in leading large-scale neuroradiology consortia; (4) leaders in RDoC-informed approaches to large-scale imaging in depression and anxiety; and (5) pioneering statistical approaches for high-dimensional data. Our aims are to (1) use the HCP protocols to acquire multi-modal data for 300 people aged 22-25 years of age who are experiencing varying degrees of acute threat, loss of reward valuation/responsiveness, and difficulties in working memory, (2) elucidate the nature of the relations among connectomes, symptoms, and behavior based on networks related to the RDoC constructs of interest, and (3) to develop data-driven, machine-learning methods to discover how connectomes for these constructs combine together to form naturally organized clusters of people. Our data will advance a neurobiological model that maps network dysfunctions to specific behaviors and symptoms. This model will provide a foundation for ultimately guiding more classifications and treatment choices according to types of neural dysfunction rather than relying on diagnostic categories that are agnostic to neurobiology."

"9320774","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this program is to provide Bioengineering training for individuals committed to careers in cardiovascular research. Cardiovascular (CV) diseases are the leading cause of mortality in the United States and health progress in this area will require training outstanding scientists with a variety of backgrounds and strengths that can provide new and innovative approaches to the study, diagnosis and treatment of CV disease. The University of Washington and Department of Bioengineering have been leaders in cardiovascular research and technology development for almost 40 years. Faculty in multiple departments in the College of Engineering and School of Medicine have strong collaborative programs in this area. The program will benefit the public by training professionals in basic science and translational research that integrates engineering, mathematics, chemistry, physiology, physics and computational skills to promote fundamental discoveries and develop new technologies. Training is also provided in commercialization of technologies and how to move research and devices towards clinical application. Our program focuses on collaborative, interdisciplinary training of pre-doctoral students with an emphasis on applying new bioengineering technologies in diagnostics and therapeutics to the study and treatment of CV pathologies. This will improve early detection and extend the quality of life for patients suffering from heart failure. We believe that the success of translational research requires highly trained scientists in both academia and industry, as well as those who can successfully transition research from universities to commercialization and the clinic. The mission of our program is to provide training that can accomplish each of these goals. The program involves 1) research in the laboratory of a chosen mentor, 2) didactic components that are unique to our trainees plus additional opportunities for training in translational and commercialization, and 3) clinical preceptorships that are unique to our program. Trainees are also required to attend a seminar series focused on CV research, with special associated sessions with speakers that are limited to trainees, as well as lectures and discussion groups in the Biomedical Research Integrity summer program, sponsored by the School of Medicine. Trainees are selected based on strong quantitative and engineering backgrounds, training environment of faculty mentors, appropriateness of the research to our programmatic focus and the potential for innovative, collaborative and translational research. Trainees present at a yearly symposium, present at national meetings, have a monthly journal club and write a yearly progress report. They are also required to apply for fellowships at the end of the two-year training period for follow-on funding and to establish a record of successful competition in gaining research support."
"9415234","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Among the co-morbidities associated with long-term HIV infection, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remains a life-threatening disease characterized by pulmonary vascular remodeling, elevated pulmonary arterial pressure and right heart failure. Evidence suggests a prominent role for inflammation and autoimmunity in idiopathic PAH, though this concept has been under studied in the context of HIV-PAH. Lack of understanding of the pathogenesis of HIV-PAH, along with deficiencies of available animal models, greatly impede identification and testing of new therapies. We have developed a simian model that closely mimics HIV-PAH. Our preliminary data indicate that inflammation, immunosenescence and autoimmune phenotypes are associated with worse pulmonary hypertension in this model. We therefore hypothesize that the development of HIV-PAH is driven by chronic immune activation and dysregulated immune responses. Additionally, we hypothesize that this dysregulated immune response is driven in part by persistent gut microbial translocation, and contributes to hyper-proliferation of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells, vascular tissue damage and fibrosis. Overall goals of this proposal are to improve the understanding of the pathogenesis of HIV-PAH and to use this information to inform the development of adjunctive therapies that will prevent or reverse HIV-PAH. We will test these hypotheses and address these goals by 1) determining the role of chronic immune activation and inflammation on the development of PAH in a non-human primate model of HIV-PAH and 2) examining the effectiveness of anti-retroviral therapy and conventional PAH therapy in this model. We have found that SIV infection is a natural cause of PAH that closely mimics HIV-PAH and we have established multiple modalities of evaluating disease progression, thus we are uniquely positioned to address these goals. The proposed studies will advance our knowledge of disease progression by allowing us to evaluate host immune responses at each stage of the disease process and test efficacy of anti-viral and anti-inflammatory therapies. These studies will not only address the mechanisms associated with the development of HIV-PAH, but they will provide critical information regarding the timing and targets that may be amenable to therapies aimed at both prevention and resolution of vascular damage, hemodynamic alterations and right heart dysfunction."
"7700647","Proliferative cells, such as fibroblasts, are well known to have a very plastic cytoskeleton. In contrast, striated muscle cells are known to have a rigid cytoskeleton. Differentiated vascular smooth muscle cells (dVSMCs), based on limited existing literature and our preliminary data, appear to function somewhere in between these two cell types. The long-term goal of this project is to determine to what degree and by what mechanisms the non-muscle cytoskeleton modulates smooth muscle contractility during agonist-, hydrodynamic and disease-induced remodeling of its structure. The Specific Aims over the next 5 years are: 1. To test the hypothesis, based on preliminary data, that actin filaments remodel during agonist stimulation and stretch in dVSMCs and to determine whether this alters contractility. 2. To test the hypothesis that specific nucleation/elongation and stabilizing proteins are involved in cytoskeletal remodeling of dSMC, focusing first on profilin, N-WASP, and VASP (nucleating/elongation), and CaD, Tm, and CaP (stabilizing). We will also test the hypothesis that the distribution of smooth muscle putative filament stabilizer proteins, CaD, Tm, and CaP, play a role in defining the localizationof the less labile actin filaments. 3. To test the hypothesis that remodeling of the dense plaques and/or dense bodies and/or their attachements to actin filaments occurs in dVSMCs, and, that the non-receptor tyrosine kinases FAK and Src regulate cytoskeleton/plaque remodeling in dVSMC. Techniques will include differential centrifugation, and in vivo labeling to monitor F and G actin populations, 2-color immunoblot, mass spectrometry, in-cell photoaffinity cross-linking and FRET, cell permeant decoy peptides, dominant negative protein fragments, antisense technology and standard cellular, biochemical and molecular methodologies. The results from this project will further our understanding of the, yet unclear mechanisms offeree maintenance in the dVSMC and will increase our fundamental understanding of the role of the nonmuscle cytoskeleton in the control of vascular function. LAY SUMMARY: The limitations of current drugs to treat cardiovascular disease is due, in part, to our limited understanding of how the muscle cells of blood vessels function. This project will expand our understanding of the VSMC and has the potential of identifying entirely novel targets for drug development."
"9377336","Project Summary Childhood adversity (e.g., abuse, poverty) is a potent risk factor for depression, increasing lifetime risk of this common and burdensome disorder by at least two-fold. While the association between adversity and depression risk is well documented, the biological mechanisms explaining this relationship are poorly understood. In this proposal, we will address this gap by testing the central hypothesis that vulnerability to adolescent- and young adult-onset depression arises, in part, via the effects of adversity-induced epigenetic changes during an early sensitive period that occurs in the first five years of life. Sensitive periods are life stages when the brain is highly plastic and experience (e.g., adversity) can impart enduring effects. This hypothesis will be prospectively tested across three aims ? in a discovery and replication approach ? using data from two large birth cohorts: (1) the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children and (2) Generation R. In Aim 1, we will investigate the extent to which the developmental timing of exposure to adversity predicts blood DNA methylation (DNAm). We will use an innovative two- stage structured lifecourse statistical modeling approach to investigate the role of repeated exposure to seven distinct types of adversities during early life (up to age 7) on DNAm in middle childhood (age 7). For each type of adversity, we will investigate the following theoretical models to determine which one or more are best supported by the data: (1) a sensitive period model, in which the effect of presence or absence of exposure to adversity on DNAm depends on the time period of the exposure; (2) an accumulation model, in which the effect of exposure to adversity on DNAm increases with the number of occasions exposed, regardless of timing; and (3) a recency model, in which the effect of exposure to adversity on DNAm is stronger for more proximal events. In Aim 2, we will use regression and causal inference-based mediation approaches and Mendelian randomization to determine the degree to which age 7 DNAm changes predict adolescent-onset depression and mediate the effect of adversity on adolescent depression. In Aim 3, we will determine the short- vs. longer-term effects of DNAm on risk for young-adult depression by examining: (a) the persistence of DNAm profiles from age 7 to age 17; and (b) the relative contribution of early vs. adolescent adversity on age 17 DNAm and risk for young-adult onset depression. Throughout, we will control for genetic factors shown to explain variability in DNAm and depression. This research will identify molecular biomarkers of exposure to adversity and risk for depression and determine the age stages when adversity is most likely to affect this biomarker. These findings will inform our understanding of the high-risk/high-reward stages of development when adversity is most harmful and when public health investments could be most efficacious in preventing depression."
"9208832","SUMMARY Resistance to Immune Checkpoint Blockade (ICB) and failure to develop durable immunity after partial responses may occur through intrinsic or acquired mechanisms. Mechanistic details and clinical correlates on how cancer escapes ICB are lacking. In previous work, we discovered that resistance to combination ICB therapy consisting of radiation (RT) and anti-CTLA4 can occur with upregulation of PDL1. This is associated with increased expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Our preliminary data reveal a key role for tumor-intrinsic resistance mechanisms driven by prolonged interferon (IFN) signaling and related to tumor burden. Moreover, recent clinical results define a link between tumor burden and efficacy of ICB revealed by changes in exhausted T cells (TEX). We have found critical transcriptional and epigenetic events in both tumor cells and responding TEX that may reveal PDL1-independent mechanisms of resistance that are driven by prolonged IFN signaling and tumor burden. To complement parallel clinical trials that test the combination of RT + ?CTLA4 + ?PD1 in patients with advanced cancer, this project seeks to investigate PDL1-independent resistance mechanisms by examining both tumor cells and T cells. We will test the hypothesis that tumor burden and prolonged IFN signaling lead to reciprocal genomic/epigenomic changes in both cell types that limit the efficacy of RT + ?CTLA4 + ?PDL1/PD1, and that the reversibility of these genomic/epigenomic changes impacts the efficacy and durability of responses. By integrating pre-clinical and clinical efforts, our goal is to understand how IFN, a major signal in the tumor microenvironment, can paradoxically drive additional but targetable immune checkpoint pathways to control T cell exhaustion and resistance to combination therapy. In so doing, we will inform the design of the next generation of clinical trials by focusing on underlying determinants of durable response."
"8106515","The Molecular Biology Core Laboratory is directed by Dr. Russell. He will be assisted in day-to-day operations by Dr. Jonathan Cohen, who is an expert in high-throughput DMA sequencing. This Core laboratory provides support for acrylamide gel electrophoresis of proteins, DMA sequencing, analysis of gene expression by oligonucleotide microarray hybridization and real-time polymerase chain reactions (PCRs), oligonucleotide procurement, genomic DMA and RNA isolation, and the maintenance and storage of bacterial strains, plasmids, and purified proteins used within this Program Project. Four experienced technicians, Kevin Anderson (100% time), Emily Brown (100%), Jeffrey Cormier (100%), and Scott Clark (25%) will perform the duties associated with this Core. The laboratory facility is located within the Department of Molecular Genetics.  For the analysis of proteins, 30 vertical electrophoresis units and 12 multi-outlet power supplies are available. SDS polyacrylamide gels are either prepared (25% of gels) or purchased pre-poured (75% of gels) and run by a single technician (Emily Brown). Following electrophoresis, individual Investigators working on the different Research Projects process the gels for autoradiography, immunoblotting, or protein sequencing. A darkroom that contains a Konica automatic X-ray developer is used to process all autoradiograms and chemilumigrams. The services of the facility are used extensively to assess protein purification, immunoprecipitation from cells, expression of recombinant proteins, and immunoblotting from cultured cells, tissues, and recombinant hosts. These techniques and methods are crucial to our studies on the expression and purification of essentially all genes and proteins with which we work. In addition, the determination of tissue-specific expression patterns of genes under study via immunoblotting in transgenic and knockout mice is heavily dependent on this aspect of the Core. As summarized in Table 1 of the Program Introduction, DMA sequencing was used to analyze the cDNA and gene structures of a large number of normal and mutant DNAs that were cloned for the first time by investigators working on this Program Project Grant (see pages 162-163). Through 2003, all of our DMA sequencing was performed on-site by personnel in the Molecular Biology Core; however, in that year, a large institution-wide DNA sequencing core facility was opened at UT Southwestern. Because of the large volume of sequencing done by this facility, their costs ($5 per sequencing reaction) were lower than ours, and we switched to using their services. At the present time, DNA samples to be sequenced (plasmids, cloned genomic DMAs, and PCR products) are prepared by individual Investigators using rigidly standardized purification protocols and given to Mr. Cormier, who then personally delivers the samples once per day to the sequencing facility. DNA sequence data are returned to Mr. Cormier electronically and thereafter dispensed to Investigators in the Program Project. The turnaround time required to sequence a given DNA sample by the facility is generally less than 24 hours, and the accuracy of the sequence data provided is very high. High-throughput sequencing of human genomic DNA for Research Project 4 is budgeted separately (see Research Project 4).  A significant aspect of our research in transgenic and knockout mice involves determining how the presence of a transgene or the loss of an endogenous gene alters the expression of other genes. To this end, the Molecular Biology Core performs large numbers of microarray experiments using chips from Affymetrix that are estimated to contain 34,000 gene sequences. In a typical experiment, total RNA is prepared from one or more tissues of isogenic age- and sex-matched wild type and knockout mice by Scott Clark, and the quality of the preparation is assessed by reverse transcription and agarose gel electrophoresis. If the RNA is judged intact, Mr. Anderson prepares complementary RNA probes labeled with biotin from each sample and hybridizes them to individual chips. After washing, each chip is scanned and variations in the hybridization signal intensity are determined and compared between chips to derive a readout of differential gene expression. This data is returned to individual Investigators of the Program Project via electronic mail in a spreadsheet format, which can be manipulated to display gene products that are increased or decreased in level in the two starting RNA populations. We have a contract with Affymetrix that provides access to a large number of chips at a cost of $435 each. An on-campus core facility charges us $90 per hybridization reaction to measure signal intensity on hybridized chips. A second gene expression service provided by the Molecular Biology Core involves quantitation of single mRNAs by real-time PCR. For a given target mRNA, Mr. Jeffrey Cormier first designs four pairs of oligonucleotide primers using software (Primer Express¿) provided by Applied Biosystems. The efficiency with which each primer pair amplifies the target mRNA is determined and those pairs that match the efficiency of primers used to amplify internal standard mRNAs (cyclophilin, [5-actin, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, 36-B4 ribosomal protein) are chosen for future use. We currently have a collection of over 500 primer pairs corresponding to mRNAs that encode proteins involved in lipid metabolism. To measure gene expression, a Program Project Investigator indicates to Mr. Cormier which mRNAs he/she wishes to measure and provides him with total RNA samples extracted from the tissues of transgenic, knockout, or control mice. Mr. Cormier then converts the RNA into cDNA by reverse transcription and uses a Beckman Biomek 2000 robot to set up triplicate real-time PCR reactions in 384-well microtiter plates for each mRNA in the RNA samples. Multiple plates are then analyzed sequentially on an Applied Biosystems Model 7900HT real-time PCR machine. Each plate is subjected to a 1.7 hour thermocycler routine during which data are collected continuously from the amplification reactions. The machine has a robotic arm that automatically inserts and removes microtiter plates at the beginning and end of the thermocycler routine, allowing us to perform real-time PCR on a 24-hour basis. The capacity of this system is large, and last year we performed -300,000 real-time PCR reactions, which makes this machine and service the most heavily requested in the Molecular Biology Core. In a relatively few instances, real-time PCR is also used to genotype transgenic mice.  Custom oligonucleotides are purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Our current rate of oligonucleotide purchase is approximately 5000 per year, a number that allows us to negotiate an excellent price for this service (23 cents/base for unpurified oligonucleotides, 25 nanomole amounts). The average length of each primer is 25 bases, and approximately 80% of primers are used as obtained (without further purification) and -20% after purification by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis by the company. An occasional oligonucleotide primer is purified in our laboratories by preparative acrylamide gel electrophoresis and Sep-Pak Ci8 chromatography prior to use. Large numbers of oligonucleotide primers are used for PCR, DNA sequencing, primer extension, genetic engineering, mutagenesis, genetic mapping, and DNA binding and hybridization experiments by all investigators on this Program Project. Preparation of genomic DNA from cells, tissues, mouse tails, and blood samples is carried out by Mr. Kevin Anderson using proteinase K and specialized buffers from Viagen Biotech (Los Angeles, CA). We have used these kits for three years and have found that the yields of DNA are about 2-fold higher, that the time of preparation is short, that the method is safer, and that the quality of genomic DNA prepared is better than that isolated by other extraction methods or kits. The isolation of genomic DNA has proven especially useful in recent years in our genetic studies in which large multigenerational pedigrees (both human and mouse) are analyzed. In general, a given sample, whether obtained from cells, tissue, or blood, is ready for restriction enzyme digestion or amplification within 16 hours of receipt. Additional DNA extraction kits are used in specialized cases, such as when small amounts of sample are available or when DNA must be isolated from fixed specimens obtained from pathology. Because of the large number of bacterial strains, plasmids, and purified proteins that are used in our experiments, it is necessary to have a central facility to catalogue and store these materials. Once a cloned DNA is isolated and characterized, a sample of the bacterial strain harboring the plasmid is stored in multiple aliquots at -70¿C in medium with glycerol. At the same time, the description of the plasmid is entered into a central data base. In this manner, each new isolate or different construction that is utilized in our studies is made available to others when needed. In addition to the individual clones that are stored, aliquots of cDNA and genomic libraries that have been prepared in the course of our experiments are also maintained. Purified proteins are treated similarly and stored in small aliquots in a large dedicated -70¿C freezer.  Organized maintenance of bacterial strains and libraries is also necessary to meet the frequent requests that we receive for these materials from other investigators. We have mailed out a voluminous number of aliquots of different cDNAs, genes, and specialized plasmid constructs to laboratories throughout the world. In addition to these clones, we have provided samples of cDNA libraries to other investigators as detailed in the Appendix, Vol. ill. The volume of these requests and the general recipient satisfaction (virtually no repeat requests) testify to the need and accuracy of this vital service and archive facility. Many of the most commonly requested cDNA clones have been deposited in the ATCC collection for general distribution to the biomedical and pharmaceutical community (see Appendix, Vol. III). Specific Interactions between the Molecular Biology Core and Research Projects 1-6. All 6 Research Projects are dependent on this Core for providing support for recombinant DMA procedures, DNA sequencing, quantitative real-time PCR, and SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis."
"9226457","The goal of this project is to use high throughput sequencing and computational analysis to gain a better understanding of the vls antigenic variation system, by which Lyme disease-causing bacteria evade the human immune system. The vls system is found in all Lyme disease bacteria and is required for evasion of adaptive immunity and survival of the organism beyond the first two weeks of infection. The vls locus consists of a single expression site encoding the surface lipoprotein VlsE and a contiguous array of silent DNA cassettes. Through a poorly understood gene conversion mechanism, random DNA segments from the silent cassettes replace the corresponding regions in the expression site, causing changes in the VlsE protein and evasion of the host antibody response. Immune system evasion leads to long-term infection and manifestations that may persist for months to years. Using DNA sequencing in combination with our analysis software, this project will provide the most comprehensive, statistically accurate analysis of the DNA recombination events in the vls antigenic variation system of Borrelia burgdorferi, a bacterium that causes Lyme disease. The resulting information will aid in understanding the processes involved in Lyme disease recombination events in mammalian hosts and evasion of host immune systems. Moreover, the approaches developed and demonstrated with the vls system can later be applied to other pathogenic systems which use similar tactics for evasion of the human and animal host immune systems. A thorough understanding of this variation system is important for the development strategies for interrupting the transmission cycle and preventing debilitating long-term manifestations of Lyme disease. The single aim of this research is to study a large number of DNA sequences (> 1.2 million) derived from animals with differing times of Lyme disease infection, and comparison to the original inoculates with which they were infected. The samples were previously collected from mice infected with Lyme disease causing clones for 7, 14, 28, and 90 days; samples from in vitro cultures and infected tissue explants will be included for comparison. PacBio DNA sequencing data will be aligned and analyzed using a novel sequence analysis algorithm (Varaligner) to provide an in-depth view of vlsE variant population present within each sample. Results obtained in different time points and tissues will be compared to assess the recombination patterns and kinetics, which may reveal the critical sequences involved in this gene conversion process. The software developed will be provided to the scientific community for similar in-depth analyses of antigenic variation systems in other bacterial and protozoal pathogens."
"9359692","Project Summary/Abstract:  Latently-infected CD4+ T cells are thought to be the main barrier to HIV eradication or functional cure, and viral reactivation from these cells likely contributes to the organ inflammation and damage observed on antiretroviral therapy. Major impediments to the development of more effective latency-reversing agents (LRAs) include the lack of knowledge about the mechanisms that govern latency and latency reversal in vivo, and the degree to which these are recapitulated by latency models in vitro. The lack of agreement between latency models and the incomplete success of human trials with LRAs suggest that it is critical to understand why different LRAs do or do not work in vivo. We have developed a new ?transcription profiling? approach that can simultaneously measure the degree to which different mechanisms contribute to reversible inhibition of HIV transcription in vivo. By applying this approach to cells from ART-suppressed patients, we have generated preliminary data suggesting a new paradigm in which latency is not (as commonly assumed) due to a block to HIV transcriptional initiation, the block to proximal elongation is greater and more pervasive than previously realized, and the main reversible blocks to HIV transcription are a previously-unrecognized block to distal transcription/polyadenylation (completion) and a block to multiple-splicing. In addition, we have intriguing new data suggesting that LRAs may act selectively on the different mechanistic blocks to HIV transcription. This study will utilize samples from clinical trials of humans treated with LRAs (aims 1 and 2) to better understand how they reverse the mechanisms of latency in vivo and to identify the optimum model to test new agents in vitro (aim 3). In aim 1, we will apply our transcription profiling approach to samples from humans treated with disulfiram, vorinostat, panobinostat, and romidepsin. We hypothesize that these agents preferentially increase HIV transcriptional initiation and elongation but have less ability to overcome blocks to completion and splicing. In aim 2, we will apply our approach to blood and gut samples from clinical trials of humans treated with agonists of toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 and 9 to understand how these agents reverse latency and lead to death of infected cells in vivo. We hypothesize that TLR agonists can overcome later blocks to HIV transcription, increasing the completed transcripts (and HIV protein/antigen) that may facilitate clearance by intrinsic cell defenses or immune killing. In aim 3, we will compare in vitro models of latency based on the degree to which they recapitulate in vivo mechanisms of latency and responses to LRAs. We will then select the best model and test new combinations of agents for their ability to increase completed/spliced transcripts and lead to death of infected cells. The results from these 3 aims should provide critical new insights on the degree to which existing LRAs reverse the different mechanisms of latency in vivo (aims 1 and 2), the effects that correlate with clearance of reactivated cells (aims 2 and 3), the best system to study LRAs in the laboratory (aim 3), and new combinations that can lead to more effective latency reversal and/or killing of infected cells (aim 3)."
"9293908","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project is designed to train to independence Bernadette Gillick, PhD, MSPT, PT as a rehabilitation scientist and to advance rehabilitation research in children with neurologic deficits. Dr. Gillick is a developing rehabilitation scientist  with over two decades of clinical experience; with research interest both in the reorganization of the developing brain after neurologic insult or injury, and in the influence of electrophysiologic and behavioral interventions on neurorecovery. Dr. Gillick's career development objectives include expanding her knowledge of running clinical trials, mastering techniques to investigate brain reorganization and creating novel interventions designed to enhance functional motor recovery. Since last submission, Dr. Gillick has reassembled a comprehensive team of mentors and a research advisory committee to direct and guide her training. The training plan includes formal meetings with mentors, didactic training with a Certificate in Clinical Research, national meeting presentations, preparation of grant applications and manuscripts. The research project takes Dr. Gillick's work in a direction not yet studied-the use of a novel form of non-invasive brain stimulation in pediatric rehabilitation. Through her prior experience, she has learned that electrophysiologic and behavioral interventions can have a beneficial synergistic effect. She has also recently completed a safety pilot in the use of a novel form of non-invasive brain stimulation. Based on these promising findings Dr. Gillick proposes to combine interventions that, with a more thorough understanding of their effects, can conveniently reach the clinical setting and will cost less. The integration of this novel rehabilitation approach may lead to improved motor function for individuals throughout their lifetimes. The advanced support provided by the K01 career development training and research of Dr. Gillick will contribute to the NIH by producing an independent scientist able to conduct clinically relevant and translational research in pediatric neurorecovery."
"9334944","Impairing anxiety affects 33% of the population by adolescence and can become chronic, leading to depression, substance abuse, school-drop out and even suicide. To reduce anxiety and prevent its sequelae, patients must be effectively treated early; yet, the first line intervention, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), has a heterogeneous response with 40-60% of treated patients continuing to experience impairment from residual symptoms. The reasons for variability in CBT outcomes remain poorly understood, but individual (including developmental) differences in brain-behavioral targets of CBT may contribute. This proposal addresses two fundamental and open questions: 1) Do individual differences in CBT-relevant brain-behavioral functions lead to variation in CBT outcomes? and 2) Does development contribute to this variation? By defining dimensional constructs at multiple levels of analysis, NIMH's RDoC provides a framework for identifying patient-specific mechanisms of CBT outcomes, across traditional, categorical anxiety disorders. The RDoC constructs of Cognitive Control (CC), Acute Threat (AT) and their interactions (CC-AT) shape the selection of putative brain- behavior targets of CBT for the proposed study. Given that CBT facilitates control over acute threat to enable effective regulation, we hypothesize that AT-, CC- and AT-CC-defined markers will predict and characterize mechanisms of CBT effect. In addition, based on emerging evidence (including our own pilot data) showing later development of neural substrate for cognitive control compared to earlier increase in brain reactivity to threat, we hypothesize that AT, CC, CC-AT markers will differentially relate to CBT effect, depending on patient age. These hypotheses will be tested by measuring data at multiple levels of analysis: brain function-structure (fMRI, DTI) and behavioral performance to index in AT, CC and CC-AT constructs, and clinical measures of anxiety in 280 youths. Of these, 210 youths with impairing anxiety will be randomized to receive CBT or a relaxation control therapy and multilevel data will be collected again after treatment. The project will connect developmental neuroscience and clinical trial research to enable a mechanistic understanding of how different patients at different ages benefit from CBT."
"9454746","Understanding the evolutionary origins and global spread of Plasmodium vivax can provide critical insight into the origin of drug resistance alleles and other important genetic differences in contemporary parasite populations. Unfortunately, nearly everything we know about African P. vivax comes from ape feces, with amplification of a few specific genes. This approach provides an incomplete and likely biased picture of population structure and the evolutionary origins of vivax due to the relatively small sequencing space analyzed. The goal of this project is to characterize the P. vivax population in Central Africa and trace migration of this population through the Horn of Africa and into Southeast Asia. Malaria remains a public health challenge through most of the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Plasmodium vivax is the most widespread of the species of malaria causing parasites, causing nearly 14 million clinical cases annually with nearly 2.5 billion people at risk of infection. Vivax malaria is highly prevalent In the Horn of Africa, South America and Southeast Asia. However, it was historically assumed to not exist in Central and Southern Africa due to the nearly uniform lack in Indigenous African populations of the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC), a primary receptor for red blood cell invasion by the parasite. However, over the last decade it has become clear that vivax transmission Is occurring in these regions and is not completely inhibited by the lack of DARC. These findings have raised many questions about the history of P. vivax and its evolutionary origins. P. vivax was recently detected by our group in DARC-negative humans in Central Africa. This discovery opens an unexpected and unprecedented window into studying the likely source population for global P. vivax. The goals of this project are: 1) Identification of risk factors for P. vivax infection based on the 2013 Demographic Health Survey (OHS) in the Democratic Republic of Congo, 2) Characterization of genetic variation and demographic properties of the human P. vivax population in Central Africa, 3) Reconstruction of the out-of-Africa migration of P. vivax into Southeast Asia, and 4) Reconstruction of the evolution of drug resistance alleles in P. vivax populations. The identification of human P. vivax infection in Central Africa allows, for the first time, a complete reconstruction of its evolutionary origins and subsequent history of migration."
"9516371","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study aims to generate robust tools and workflows for creating human induced pluripotent stem cell (hIPSC)-based models of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and to develop scalable assays for predictive molecular and cellular phenotypes relevant to autism. We have identified several key bottlenecks in the widespread adoption of hIPSCs as tools that allow the dissection of molecular mechanisms underlying neurological disease and enable preclinical drug screening. We have assembled a team of five leading experts in neuroscience, stem cell biology and computational biology, who will collaborate up with three innovation-driven biotech companies (Fluidigm, BD Biosciences and Synthetic Genomics) to overcome these roadblocks. Since autism is considered a disorder of synapse development and function that ultimately leads to circuit dysfunction in the brain, we will develop quantitative assays of synapse end network function that can be used in high-throughput drug screens. We also aim to uncover the upstream molecular events that precipitate synaptic and network dysregulation, and identify predictive RNA and protein signatures. Our strategy is to engineer models of genetic forms of autism by genomic manipulation using a well- characterized, neurotypical hIPSC line as the starting point. We will then differentiate these normal and mutant cells to cortical neurons and astrocytes, the two cell types that have been most strongly implicated in autism pathophysiology. Highly quantitative and sensitive assays at the single-cell level will be used to identify changes in protein and RNA expression that can distinguish ASD neurons and astrocytes from normal cells. Finally, we will develop assays measuring synapse density and strength using advanced technology that can be used in high-throughput format. We envision that our tools, technologies and assays, all of which we will make publicly available as they are being generated, will both critically contribute to our understanding of ASD and accelerate preclinical research of neurological disease."
"9177116","Summary Hip fractures are the most devastating result of osteoporosis and often the first step in a downward spiral of lost ambulation and independence, institutionalization, and secondary medical morbidity and mortality. Within one year of hip fracture, 50% of patients will be unable to walk without assistance, 25% will require long-term care, and 20% will have died. One potent regulator of bone formation is physical loading (Krahl et al. 1994); however, the cellular sensing mechanism directing mechanotransduction has proven to be elusive. Our laboratory is one of the first to demonstrate that the osteocyte primary cilium plays a major role in this process (Malone et al. 2007). The primary cilium is a solitary cellular extension present in virtually every cell in the body, but its function has yet to be fully characterized. As osteocyte mechanosensors, these organelles act synergistically with other known regulators of bone metabolism. Our contribution is to elucidate the primary cilium microdomain?s role in osteocyte mechanotransduction and identify the intracellular signaling mechanisms involved. This contribution is significant because it catalyzes a continuum of research leading to novel pharmacologic therapeutics that potentiate mechanical loading at a molecular level. The long-term goal of this project is to determine how primary cilia contribute to bone mechanosensing and capitalize on this knowledge to develop novel therapies. The overall objective of this application is to exploit the molecular mechanisms identified in the last funding period to sensitize osteocyte primary cilia and identify osteocyte-cilia specific therapeutic targets. We will achieve this objective by establishing the potential of osteocyte cilia therapeutics in vivo (SA1), enhancing osteocyte-specificity through molecular manipulation of the intraciliary signaling system (SA2), and ensuring that ciliary strategies do not have adverse effects on bone biology (SA3). At the conclusion of this project, we expect to contribute potential pharmacologic agents that target unique characteristics of the osteocyte microdomain to bias bone formation without adverse effects to normal physiology. Osteoporosis prevention will dramatically increase patient quality of life, reduce morbidity, and cut health care costs. A collateral benefit will be extending this knowledge to applications in other cell types to develop treatments for numerous cilia-associated diseases."
"9327359","Abstract Major depressive disorder in individuals with spinal cord injury has a profound impact on quality of life, correlating with limited functional improvement during rehabilitation and increased mortality rates. The incidence of depression in these individuals is three times higher than the general population, while response rates to classical antidepressants are much lower. The underlying physiological mechanisms responsible for SCI-induced depression are not known; however, levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as Interleukin (IL)-6 and TNF?, are often elevated in the serum of patients with major depression. In the case of SCI, there is evidence of remote, chronic inflammation in supraspinal brain regions that are associated with emotional regulation, such as the dorsal raphe nucleus. As the primary source of serotonergic input to the brain, perturbations of the dorsal raphe could result in an imbalance in serotonin- the neurotransmitter classically associated with depression. Activity of serotonin neurons is normally modulated through both local binding of serotonin autoreceptors on the soma and dendrites, as well as glutamatergic projections from the prefrontal cortex to local GABAergic interneurons in the dorsal raphe. The neural circuitry of the dorsal raphe could provide a potential source of vulnerability to inflammation through a disruption in glutamate homeostasis. Preliminary data from our lab indicate a significant correlation of increased levels of TNF? in the dorsal raphe with depressive behaviors after moderate thoracic spinal cord contusion. This cytokine has been shown to decrease expression of the glutamate transporter GLT1, significantly impairing glutamate reuptake. Increased extracellular glutamate could result in hyperactivity of the GABAergic interneurons, decreasing serotonin activity. We hypothesize that SCI-induced depression is mediated by hypoactivity of serotonin neurons in the dorsal raphe, resulting from TNF?-mediated glutamate imbalance. We will use a moderate, midline thoracic contusion model in adult female rats to test our hypothesis. Depressive phenotype will be assessed using a battery of behavioral tests that mimic classic symptoms of depression in patients. We believe this depressive phenotype can be ameliorated through the inhibition of TNF? after injury and will test for efficacy after acute or delayed treatment with XPro 1595.This study will provide us with greater insight into the mechanism of SCI-induced depression, as well as a potential for novel therapeutic treatment."

Our site will continue to recruit in the surrounding rural areas around Penn State Hershey combined with a more urban/suburban population in Rochester. Our concept protocol builds on substantial preliminary data from a currently funded R01 trial based at Penn State (OWL PCOS) which allows for realistic projections of sample size, dropout rate and adverse event rates. Our RCT will test the hypothesis that a four month preconception weight loss arm in overweight/obese women with PCOS will improve live birth compared to a control intervention of continuous OCP in a total of 306 subjects. All women will then undergo four cycles of ovulation induction with an oral agent with timed intercourse. Additionally we will study women who conceive during pregnancy, and enroll infants in our Pregnancy Registry for 5 years. Participating male partners will be studied systematically throughout the trial. Our trial uniquely extends from preconception to infancy, utilizes a proven weight loss intervention, incorporates a unique multidisciplinary team of kinesiologist, nutritionist, and behavioral psychologist, and builds on the infrastructure of previous RMN studies."
"9397093","Following traumatic brain injury (TBI), as well as other types of brain injury, many patients experience a state of coma in which they are unawake and unaware. Coma very rarely lasts more than two weeks, at which point patients either regain consciousness or emerge into a state of wakefulness (sleep/wake cycles, eye opening, basic reflexes) without regaining awareness of themselves or their environment. These patients suffer from Disorders of Consciousness (DoC), and their level of awareness is assessed for diagnosis into the vegetative (no awareness) or minimally conscious state (periodic increases in awareness). These diagnoses are notoriously inaccurate, offering little predictive value in prognoses. Awareness can return within weeks, years, or never. Patients? families are therefore left with unimaginably difficult decisions and little information on which to base them. Our understanding of the neural correlates and outcomes of DoC is severely lacking, due to the fact that minimal basic science investigation has been pursued. To date DoC have only been examined in clinical studies, which are often encumbered by high variability, low sample sizes, limited data output, and lack of necessary controls. To address these challenges, the proposed project will establish the first preclinical model for studying DoC to provide more accurate diagnoses and prognoses, improved inclusion criteria for clinical trials, and a platform for developing new therapeutics.  Coma results from white matter damage due to rotational acceleration of the head during TBI, not from forces associated with impact or linear acceleration. Currently, the only system in the world that accurately models rotational acceleration-induced TBI is the swine injury model utilized by the Center for Brain Injury & Repair at the University of Pennsylvania. This project will apply the rotational TBI model to induce coma, and subjects will then be cared for in a swine intensive care unit and monitored for emergence into wakefulness without awareness utilizing a battery of electroencephalographic, behavioral, and other analyses. It has been hypothesized that while brainstem injury is necessary to produce coma, recovery from DoC and efficacy of treatments may be dependent upon the extent of diffuse axonal injury throughout the forebrain. Therefore, a pharmacological pontine lesion shown to produce coma in rats will be applied in swine to test whether precise white matter injury in pons is sufficient to lead to DoC. Subjects from each injury group that exhibit DoC lasting one month will be used to evaluate existing treatments for improving awareness. Specifically, deep brain stimulation will be tested in thalamus and basal forebrain, and we will administer the GABA agonist zolpidem while measuring changes in awareness. Additional data will be collected postmortem, including diffusion tensor imaging to map intact white matter tracts, and various pathological and immunochemical staining. This study will open the field of DoC to basic science for the first time, providing clinicians and families desperately needed clarity and establishing a platform for developing future therapeutics."
"9390711","Project Abstract Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) methods, principally transcranial direct current simulation (tDCS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) are neuromodulation techniques that have been the subject of great recent interest. In typical tDCS procedures a pair of large electrodes (e.g., 25cm2) is attached to the scalp and a constant current of 1-2 mA passed between them for periods of 10-30 min. In tACS, the constant current intensity is similar, but an alternating sinusoidal waveform is usually employed. tES strategies have been indicated for a wide range of conditions, including stroke rehabilitation, treatment of epilepsy and for improving cognitive, motor, language and memory performance in healthy subjects. Details of underlying mechanisms of both tDCS and tACS remain unclear. It has been assumed that tDCS effects are greatest in brain structures nearest stimulating electrodes and that these structures experience the largest electric fields or current flow. At low intensities (ca. 1 mA) tDCS excitatory effects have been observed in structures under more positive electrodes and inhibitory effects under negatively polarized electrodes. It has been hypothesized that this is because externally applied field either depolarizes or hyperpolarizes resting membrane voltages in targeted tissue, leading to increased excitability or inhibition respectively. However, there is also evidence that at 2 mA intensity, increased excitability is observed regardless of polarity. Apart from factors relating to the subject initial state, neuroanatomy and CSF volume, it has also been suggested that major contributions to variability between individual sessions of a study or may be inconsistencies in electrode application protocols. Knowledge of the exact distribution formed within the brain by externally applied currents may clarify many study outcomes. The effects of different current application protocols, electrode designs and even prior study procedures could easily be distinguished. Most importantly, correlation of internal current density and electric field distributions with brain activity measures will help researchers attempt better detailed explorations of mechanism. In these studies we propose to investigate dosimetry, replication, and correlations between current density distributions and brain activity levels found in a previously validated task. Images of electrical field and current density distributions will be related to functional measures (fMRI) and behavioral measures of tDCS effect. The outcome of these analyses will be the first steps towards customized current delivery, direct insight into the impact of neuroanatomic variation on tDCS delivery and the first precise investigations into existing hypotheses of tES mechanisms."

"9314027","PROJECT SUMMARY The multi-drug resistant bacterium S. maltophilia (Sm) is increasingly recognized as an important opportunistic and nosocomial pathogen. Pneumonia and blood stream infections are the most common manifestation of Sm infection, although Sm is also linked with CNS, eye, heart, skin, and urinary tract infections. Sm infection is also an independent risk factor for lung exacerbations in cystic fibrosis patients. Despite the emerging role of Sm in disease and the multi-drug resistance of Sm, our understanding of this Gram-negative bacterium's virulence is quite minimal. Thus, we embarked upon research aimed at developing methods to study Sm and identify factors that promote pathogenesis. After establishing a murine model for pneumonia, developing means for mutagenizing Sm, and documenting the importance of Sm's type II protein secretion system, we began to investigate the nature of Sm iron acquisition and the existence of a Sm siderophore. Past work from our lab and others had shown that siderophores are major facilitators of virulence in various other pathogens, including other agents of pneumonia and bloodstream infection. To begin, we determined that the genome of Sm strain K279a is predicted to encode a complete siderophore system, including a putative biosynthesis pathway, an outer membrane receptor for ferrisiderophore, and the other necessary import and export machinery. Compatible with these genomic data, we determined that K279a as well as other clinical isolates of Sm produce a siderophore-like activity when grown in a deferrated, chemically-defined medium. This activity was detected by both the Arnow assay which identifies catecholate structures and the Chrome Azurol S assay which detects high affinity iron chelators independently of structure. The secreted activity also had biological activity, as it rescued the growth of iron-starved Sm. When we mutated a gene in the putative biosynthesis locus of strain K279a, there was complete loss of both Arnow- and CAS-activity and bioactivity. Although the Sm biosynthesis locus had some similarity to that of enterobactin, a catecholate made by enteric bacteria, the Sm siderophore-containing supernatants were unable to rescue the growth of an enterobactin-utilizing indicator strain, and conversely iron-starved Sm could not use purified enterobactin. Together, our data suggest that Sm secretes a novel catecholate siderophore that is distinct from enterobactin. Thus, we hypothesize that the siderophore secreted by K279a is a virulence factor of Sm. To address our hypotheses, we propose to i) determine the identity (i.e., structure) of the Sm siderophore using both mass spectrometry and NMR analyses (Aim 1), and ii) test siderophore mutants in two different murine models of disease, the published pneumonia model and a new bacteremia model (Aim 2). The results of this grant will help establish a foundation for the nascent Sm field such that future efforts will be able to focus on characterizing systems and secreted factors that are most important. In addition to providing much-needed insight into Sm pathogenesis, the data obtained will define a new type of siderophore and thus may lead to new forms of disease treatment or prevention."

"8114877","The protease-antiprotease hypothesis of emphysema pathogenesis has support from many human  and animal studies. A longstanding tenet of this hypothesis has been that proteases relevant to  emphysema pathogenesis must be capable of degrading elastin. However, data in recent years  indicates that collagenolytic activity may induce emphysema. Membrane-type 1 matrix  metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), a cell-surface MMP that cleaves fibrillar collagens, and EMMPRIN, an  inducer of MT1-MMP, are detectable in emphysematous lung tissue, suggesting a role for MT1-MMP in  emphysema pathogenesis. Moreover, monocyte migration in vitro requires MT1-MMP so that MT1-  MMP is likely to be involved in the accumulation of macrophages in the lungs from smoking as well as  in destruction of alveolar walls. The studies we propose will determine the roles of MT1-MMP and  EMMPRIN in the pathogenesis of emphysema. We will determine whether levels of MT1-MMP and  EMMPRIN expression by monocytes, at baseline and upon stimulation, have a relationship to  monocyte migration among smokers with and without emphysema, and whether levels of MT1-MMP  and EMMPRIN expression by alveolar macrophages correlate with emphysema as determined by chest  computed tomography (CT). To accomplish these objectives we will assess the role of MT1-MMP on  the migration of smokers' monocytes with MT1-MMP blocking antibodies, and we will measure MT1-  MMP and EMMPRIN mRNAs by quantitative PCR on alveolar macrophages harvested by  bronchoalveolar lavage and laser capture microdissection. These studies will be complemented by  analyses of the pulmonary responses to tobacco smoke in mice with targeted deletions (knockouts) of  the genes for MT1-MMP or EMMPRIN, and in mice with deletion of the gene for TIMP-2, the principal  inhibitor of MT1-MMP. Taken together, the proposed studies will contribute new understanding of  mechanisms of pulmonary inflammation and emphysema that occur in response to tobacco smoke."
"8114887","The long-term goal of this project is to understand how the immune response contributes to COPD. In that  context, we submit that the innate immune system of the airways can provide critical signals for host defenses  under normal conditions but can also trigger excessive mucous cell metaplasia under other conditions. Indeed,  studies of genetically susceptible mice indicate that respiratory paramyxoviruses can trigger a permanent switch  to excessive mucous cell metaplasia driven by natural killer T cell (NKT cell) activation and consequent  macrophage production of IL-13. Moreover, if mice with an activated NKT cell-macrophage pathway are then  exposed to a normally innocuous level of cigarette smoke, they develop a striking increase in small airway mucus  production to the point of respiratory death. The nature the response to viral infection or virus-smoke interaction  appears to be distinct from the traditional view of NKT cell pressure on macrophages or the development of  alternative macrophage activation developed in studies of the response to microbial infection or allergens.  However, a similar immune pathway may be active in COPD patients as well as amplification of the terminal ste  in the pathway (i.e., mucous cell metaplasia) perhaps by IL-13 production and/or responsiveness in airway  epithelial cells. Our new observations prompt us to propose how the immune response may be triggered and  maintained to drive the COPD phenotype. We specifically hypothesize that mucous cell metaplasia depends on  NKT cell activation and consequent macrophage production of IL-13. This pathway overlaps with the one in  allergic asthma, but exhibits distinct features. Furthermore, we suggest that this pathway synergizes with the  response to cigarette smoking and thereby produces more severe mucous cell metaplasia and mucus obstruction.  We further propose that this disease trait is a critical but treatable feature of COPD and may be associated with  distinct biomarkers of bronchitic airway disease versus emphysema or allergic asthma. Accordingly, we have the  following specific aims: (1) define the role of the NKT cell-macrophage activation pathway leading to IL-13  production and mucous cell metaplasia in COPD patients; (2) define the role of the innate immune program of  airway epithelial cells in COPD patients, focusing on auto-amplification of IL-13 action at the level of the  epithelium and (3) define the immune mechanism for increased susceptibility to cigarette smoke induction on  goblet cell metaplasia and airway hyperreactivity in a mouse model, focusing on the molecular mechanism for  NKT cell activation, macrophage activation towards IL-13 production, and epithelial programming towards IL-13  and mucin gene expression. Together, the studies aim to establish a new immune pathway that may normally  defend against respiratory infection but may be skewed to drive the development of mucous cell metaplasia in  COPD."
"9395437","Project Summary/Abstract Chronic liver disease (CLD) and cirrhosis is the 12th leading cause of death in the United States. Currently, the only treatment for patients with end-stage liver disease is a liver transplant. However, the scarcity of donor organs makes this option untenable for many patients. Therefore there is a great need to develop new therapies to prevent or reverse patient progression to end-stage liver disease. Progression is thought to be due in part to failed hepatic regeneration. Under most circumstances, after liver injury hepatic repair is mediated by proliferation of hepatocytes. However, when hepatocyte proliferation is impaired, liver progenitor cells (LPCs) arise from the biliary epithelial cell (BEC) compartment, expand, and differentiate into hepatocytes. LPC expansion is observed in human CLD patients, and thus LPCs represent a promising target for therapies aimed at promoting liver regeneration (LR) in patients. However the role of LPCs in LR remains controversial. A common model to study LPCs in rodents is the choline deficient, ethionine-supplemented (CDE) diet, which induces liver injury and promotes expansion of LPCs. However, the CDE diet does not block hepatocyte proliferation, so LR is hepatocyte-driven in the CDE diet model. The ?-catenin signaling pathway plays an important role in LR by promoting hepatocyte proliferation. Thus we hypothesize lack of ?-catenin in hepatocytes would impair hepatocyte proliferation after CDE diet-induced liver injury and promote LPC- mediated LR. In Aim 1, we will test this hypothesis using two models of genetic fate tracing in mice. In the first model, we will perform negative lineage tracing by injecting mice with adeno-associated virus serotype 8 (AAV8) carrying Cre recombinase to simultaneously delete ?-catenin in hepatocytes and label hepatocytes with EYFP. In the second method we will perform positive lineage tracing, utilizing Foxl1-Cre mice to label LPCs with EYFP and injecting these mice with ?-catenin small interfering RNA conjugated to a hepatocyte- targeting ligand to knockdown ?-catenin expression specifically in hepatocytes. We will place both mouse models on the CDE diet to determine if LPCs give rise to hepatocytes to mediate LR. The mechanisms of LPC differentiation to hepatocytes are also not understood. Due to the important role of ?- catenin in hepatocyte maturation in development, we hypothesize ?-catenin is important for LPC-to-hepatocyte differentiation. In Aim 2, we will test this hypothesis in vivo through placing mice with lack of ?-catenin in both hepatocytes and BECs (the origin of LPCs) on the CDE diet, where we would expect to observe a defect in LR. We will test this hypothesis in vitro utilizing the small cholangiocyte cell line (SMCC), an immortalized BEC line which expresses LPC-marker Foxl1. We will treat SMCCs with HGF, EGF, and other factors to induce differentiation to hepatocyte-like cells, and we predict ?-catenin-inhibited SMCCs will fail to differentiate. In summary, our work will thoroughly describe the role of ?-catenin in LPC-mediated LR, potentially identifying a new mechanism which could be targeted to promote LR in human CLD patients."
"9324233","Project Summary/Abstract The comprehensive term ?podocytopathy? represents a poorly defined diagnostic entity, which includes a wide spectrum of histologic patterns of glomerular disease, all characterized by structural changes to the glomerular filter and proteinuria. Current pathomechanistic insights into this diverse group of diseases are limited, and, with the exception of few promising studies, have not provided substantial therapeutic guidance. Pathologically, podocyte loss remains the single unifying observation and closely correlates with disease progression. Podocyte death has recently gained acceptance as a key pathway to podocyte loss, although the molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Hic-5, a member of the LIM domain family of proteins, is increased in podocytes along the glomerular filtration barrier in human podocytopathies. Distinct from a pure function as a focal adhesion protein, our novel preliminary data suggest a pro-survival role for hic-5 in podocytes following injurious events. Specifically, our findings indicate that hic-5 protects podocytes from cell death by mediating cell cycle control through stabilization of p21 after genotoxic stress in vitro and in vivo, thereby maintaining the structural integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier, ameliorating proteinuria and preventing glomerular scarring. The overarching goal of this proposal is to elucidate the pro-survival role of hic-5 following podocyte injury by studying its effect on cell cycle checkpoint control. Specifically, we aim to: 1) Define on a molecular level how hic-5 mediates changes in the podocyte cell cycle after DNA damage by using a podocyte cell line in vitro and murine Adriamycin nephropathy as a model of genotoxic glomerular injury in vivo; and 2) Examine whether the presence of hic-5 in podocyte foot processes results in the activation of a pro-survival signature in podocytopathies in vivo by use of an innovative super-resolution immunofluorescence microscopy technique to validate our findings in human disease. Understanding the role of hic-5 in preventing podocyte loss by regulating the podocyte cell cycle may guide our efforts to discover pathways to nephron loss, identify prognostic biomarkers and develop targeted podocyte-specific therapies for proteinuric kidney diseases."
"9315461","Summary Ocular dominance plasticity (ODP) is a canonical form of synaptic plasticity in vivo triggered by monocular deprivation (MD). It has provided crucial insights into how visual circuits develop and remodel in early life. We have shown that ODP in cats is enhanced by sleep. Our goal is to more completely identify the underlying mechanisms and the brain states in which they occur. To achieve this goal we will develop a new mouse- based model of sleep-dependent ODP. MD in mice triggers physiological and morphological changes in cortical circuits similar to those described in carnivore species. However, unlike carnivore species, molecular techniques used to visualize neuronal activity and measure mRNA are widely used in mice. There are currently no studies that have exploited this model system to identify how experience and sleep influence ODP. In this exploratory proposal, we will use a novel combination of polysomnography and calcium- fluorescence based microscopy in vivo to record plastic changes in visual cortical neurons across sleep and wakefulness. We will also use Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP) technology combined with microarray and RNAseq to isolate changes in the transcriptome that occur in the sleeping, remodeling visual cortex. The results of these investigations will provide the foundation for a larger investigation of how experience and sleep shape the developing brain."

This low-interaction strategy will allow us to describe ongoing infection trends across the Chicago area and characterize individual and community level factors that enhance HIV risk, while minimizing the potential intervention effects of study participation in and of itself. Further, given the rapidly advancing state of HIV prevention technologies, we will use our large, longitudinal cohort of HIV-uninfected youth to monitor PrEP access, uptake and adherence across time. More intensive study of those who acquire HIV while enrolled in the cohort, as well as those ?prevalent positives? at baseline, using innovative social network and phylodynamic analysis, will identify clusters of ongoing active transmission and test the feasibility of novel approaches to target biomedical prevention to those in the highest risk subgroups. As the longitudinal data accumulate, we will be well-poised to design and pilot test virtual strategies for optimal HIV prevention for young MSM and TGW. Our proposed methodologies assure the maximum likelihood of leading to meaningful advances in HIV prevention including the development of tools and strategies that are easily implemented and scalable for export to other communities suffering from similar epidemics of HIV infection. We propose the following specific aims: Aim 1: To enroll and retain a large cohort of 13-34 year-old MSM and TGW (1000/year over 3 year) at high risk of HIV acquisition using tested, novel and cost-effective enrollment strategies through social media and targeted electronic advertisement. Aim 1a: To capture at least 230 HIV seroconversions occurring over the course of the study and 300 previously undiagnosed HIV-infected youth.

"9393474","Project Summary Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) remain a population in the U.S. for whom the burden of HIV is high and disproportionate, particularly among younger GBMSM and GBMSM of color, for whom HIV incidence continues to rise despite decades of HIV prevention research to curb the epidemic. However, even among these highest risk groups, risk for infection is not equivalent and the goal of this study is to better understand what factors differentiate levels of risk for HIV infection. Research to date suggests that this disproportionate burden is likely to be exacerbated by psychosocial disparities faced by this population in the form of syndemics and sexual minority stress. However, research on these factors has been limited by a focus on risk for HIV infection operationalized as risk behavior or cross-sectional prevalence of HIV, making actual vulnerability to infection and temporal associations difficult, if not impossible, to determine. We are submitting this application in response to RFA-AI-16-031 Limited Interaction Targeted Epidemiology (LITE) to Advance HIV Prevention (UG3/UH3). We propose to recruit and enroll a large and diverse cohort of approximately 8,000 GBMSM ages 16 and older in the U.S. and Puerto Rico who are at high risk for infection. We will utilize mobile sexual networking applications (?mobile apps?) to identify and enroll these men both to allow for rapid and efficient recruitment and because these apps rapidly increasing in popularity, with research demonstrating that men who use mobile apps are at higher levels of risk for HIV infection than GBMSM recruited through other means. Using this cohort, we will work to achieve three primary aims: (1) we will establish HIV prevalence as well as prevalence of rectal sexually transmitted infections (STIs; gonorrhea and chlamydia) at baseline and subsequently establish rates of HIV and rectal STI incidence among these men 12 months thereafter; (2) we will utilize baseline levels of syndemic, minority stress, and other relevant psychosocial risk factors to develop a model of those modifiable factors that contribute to increased risk for HIV seroconversion (i.e., incidence) as well as rectal STI infection; (3) we will utilize the model to target men in the highest quartile of risk for HIV seroconversion in the cohort and follow them every 6 months thereafter for an additional two years to examine the predictive utility in prospectively predicting HIV seroconversion as well as time to seroconversion. Developing a model of modifiable psychosocial risk factors for actual HIV seroconversion and subsequently testing its reliability and validity in a prospective design has high potential to improve the next generation of HIV prevention interventions aimed at reducing disparities for this population."
"9308686","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hereditary forms of nephrolithiasis that cause marked excretion of insoluble minerals lead to recurring stones from childhood and risk for chronic kidney disease. Therefore, the Rare Kidney Stone Consortium (RKSC) was formed 5 years ago to advance the care of primary hyperoxaluria, cystinuria, Dent disease, and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency. Secure, web-based registries and tissue banks have been established and are open for collaborative projects. The RKSC provides readily available disease information, diagnostic testing, hypotheses for pilot studies, and well-characterized patient groups for clinical trials. Partnerships with patient advocacy groups (PAGs) for each of the diseases allows rapid spread of information among patients, families, and local physicians. Together with our PAGs we recently hosted successful patient and family education days in New York, London, and Rochester, MN. We have expanded training and research opportunities for young investigators, and successfully directed them to rare diseases research. The primary goal of this RKSC renewal is to expand our successful base. Specific aims are: (1) Integrate and engage patients and PAGs as research partners of the RKSC to improve disease outcomes. (2) Identify patients at risk of progressive loss of kidney function. (3) Identify pathways of kidney injury. (4) Identify novel therapeutic targets for potential pilot studies. The RKSC will pursue these goals in 4 interlinked projects, each centered around a disease process. A key component will be secure web-based patient databases used to support tissue bank programs and appropriate clinical studies. We will leverage our successful registries to establish active follow-up of prospective cohorts in this funding cycle. Longitudinal data collection will further define the natural history, quality of life, and inflammatory biosignature f each disease. The RKSC success has been recognized with significant co-funding of our programs by our affiliated PAGs and institutions this cycle ($198,500 +/year)."
"9384844","Abstract This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Danhong Wang, a physician-scientist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Dr. Wang is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient- oriented neuroimaging research on psychiatric disorders. This K01 award will provide Dr. Wang with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert in patient-oriented research in psychiatric neuroimaging; (2) to conduct experimental investigations of neurobiological correlates in patients with psychosis; (3) to implement revolutionary individual-level functional mapping techniques in clinical studies; and (4) to develop an independent clinical research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Wang has assembled a mentoring team comprised of three mentors: Dr. Dost Öngür, Chief of the McLean Hospital Psychotic Disorders Division, who leads a neuroimaging laboratory studying the biology of psychotic illness; Dr. Randy Buckner, Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at Harvard University and Director of Psychiatric Neuroimaging at Massachusetts General Hospital, one of the pioneers in functional MRI research; and Dr. Suzanne Haber, Professor of Pharmacology and Physiology at the University of Rochester, a leading scientist in the field of neuroanatomy. In addition, Dr. Hesheng Liu, Associate Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and a computational neuroscientist with expertise in functional imaging, will collaborate on this project. Dr. Wang will engage in multiple career development activities to expand her ability to develop mechanistic insights about psychiatric disorders. These include new training in patient-oriented experimental research, a better understanding of the psychopathology of psychosis, and a stronger grasp of neuroanatomy. She will also receive advanced training in cognitive and clinical neuroscience. Determining the disconnected neural circuits underlying psychosis has proved elusive. Dr. Wang's research project aims to reveal circuitry abnormalities in psychotic patients using a subject-specific, cross-diagnostic approach. In Aim 1, Dr. Wang will establish methods for accurately characterizing the cortical and subcortical functional connectivity networks in individual patients. In Aim 2, leveraging a cross-diagnostic cohort of psychotic patients that will be scanned using the protocol optimized for individual-level functional analyses, as well as an existing patient data set, Dr. Wang will identify and validate cortical and subcortical functional connectivity abnormalities related to the severity of psychotic symptoms. In Aim 3, Dr. Wang will investigate the temporal variations of connectivity in individual patients and reveal abnormalities in dynamic functional connectivity related to symptoms. A series of preliminary studies conducted by Dr. Wang have laid the solid foundation for each specific aim. This research will form the basis of a study for identifying the ?connectivity hubs? in individual patients for potential modulation, to be proposed in an R01 grant application before the end of the K award."
"9530739","The overall goal of this application is to understand whether distinctive features of the neonatal immune system, combined with prompt initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in perinatally-infected infants, can sufficiently alter the size and distribution of proviral reservoirs to facilitate viral remission, where cART can be stopped without viremic rebound. A major barrier to HIV-1 remission is the early establishment of latent cellular reservoirs that permit lifelong persistence of replication-competent virus. The opportunity to start cART promptly in infants may severely restrict or abort the formation of these long-lived HIV-1 reservoirs. This concept is exemplified in the recent case of the Mississippi Child in whom cART started by 31 hours of age led to HIV-1 remission. We specifically hypothesize that early or very early cART in the context of HIV-1 infection of a predominantly fetal immune system restricts the size, distribution, and replication-competence of the HIV-1 reservoirs in long-lived central memory CD4+ T cells, eventually permitting HIV-1 remission. In three different cohorts of perinatally-infected children spanning the neonatal period through adolescents, including in a planned clinical trial sponsored by the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials (IMPAACT) Network, we will use ultrasensitive molecular, immunology and virus culture assays to: 1) Confirm ongoing decay of and identify where HIV-1 proviral reservoirs reside under long-term effective cART in perinatal HIV-1 infection, 2) identify a virologic and immunologic profile of HIV-1 near-remission that indicates the appropriate timing of cART cessation after very early or early cART initiation, 3) determine if infection of neonatal CD4+ T cells is associated with diminished HIV-1 integration events and replication-deficient genomes that permit clearance of HIV-1 in neonates initiating very early cART and 4) determine whether a predominance of fetal T and/or myeloid cells at birth is associated with and predictive of rapid decay of a restricted viral reservoir. The proposed project will improve scientific knowledge on the long-term virologic and immunologic effects of early/very early HAART for infants who are now likely to survive to young adulthood. It will also provide insights into the early infection events leading up to HIV-1 reservoir formation and whether prompt antiretroviral therapy will lead to HIV-1 remission or cure, thus sparing HIV- 1 infected children a lifetime of therapy. The studies have direct relevance to the research mission of the National Institutes of Health where finding ways to achieve viral remission or cure is a top research priority area."
"9279490","Genomics technology is sufficiently advanced to measure DNA sequence variation and RNA expression in clinical samples. However, the integration of genomic measurements into healthcare is outpacing the training of physicians and scientists, and many are ill-equipped to use this information to improve the health of patients. Thus, it is imperative to train the next generation of physician and scientist leaders in Genomic Medicine. At the University of Pennsylvania, we propose a post-doctoral training program in Genomic Medicine, focused on translational medicine and informatics, to be led by Drs. Jason Moore, Edward Rose Professor of Informatics, and Director of the Penn Institute for Biomedical Informatics, and Katherine Nathanson, Professor of Medicine and Genetics, and Associate Director of Population Sciences, Abramson Cancer Center. A challenge for this program is providing a foundation for training in Genomic Medicine, applicable to both MD and PhD trained fellows, recognizing that each may enter the program with different skill sets and experiences. It is thus essential to provide all fellows with a strong background framework so that they can develop exciting and relevant projects in Genomic Medicine. The trainees will enroll in a two year program, including didactic courses, clinical and laboratories rotations, interactive learning experiences and research training. We require a balanced portfolio of courses, which will cover the latest advances in genomics, focused on the role of genomics in disease processes, quantitative sciences, including biomedical informatics and biostatistics, scientific writing and ELSI issues. The 32 trainers have been selected based on their expertise in Genomic Medicine and come from multiple departments, which is further enlarged with clinicians experience in the provision of Genomic Medicine. The trainees will be dually mentored in a research project by a balanced team (e.g. clinician and basic scientist) experienced in Genomic Medicine. Trainees will participate in clinical rotations designed to give them experiences that range from the generation of massively parallel sequence data to data analysis to reporting back the results to patients. Trainees also will participate in interactive activities, which include a journal club, research in progress presentations, clinical genetics rounds and retreats. This combination of coursework, experiential clinical rotations, participation in interactive activities, and mentored research experience will prepare our physicians and scientists for careers in Genomic Medicine. The applicant pool at the University of Pennsylvania is exceptionally strong and diverse, and we anticipate being able to attract outstanding candidates. We plan to enroll two trainees per year for the first two years, and three in the latter three years."

"9208831","SUMMARY Besides cell intrinsic damage to DNA, radiation (RT) can have systemic effects on the immune system. As such, recent evidence indicates that the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) for cancer can be improved by combination strategies that utilized both RT and ICB. However, our understanding of the pathways that RT utilizes to improve immune-mediated tumor response is limited. Moreover, not all cancer types may benefit from ICB with or without RT, likely necessitating additional maneuvers to enhance the efficacy of these treatments for many tumor types. Accumulating data point toward a role for pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that are normally responsible for sensing pathogen-associated molecular patterns to activate the innate immune system and optimize immune response. RT may similarly promote the engagement of PRR pathways, resulting in activation of dendritic cells (DCs) that facilitate T cell cross-priming. The types of PRRs, the role of PRRs expressed in tumor cells, the nature of the ligands that engage PRRs, and how such events might converge on DC function after RT are not well understood. Therefore, to complement parallel clinical trials that test the combination of RT + ?CTLA4 + ?PD1 in patients with advanced cancer, this project seeks to investigate how RT mediates immunomodulatory effects through PRRs and how these signaling events get relayed to DCs to enhance the T cell repertoire. In order to expand the types of cancers that may benefit from RT + ICB, this proposal also examines how engagement of CD40 can non- redundantly activating DCs to further improve response particularly for poorly immunogenic tumors. Thus, by understanding the immunomodulatory mechanism of action of RT, its limitations, and ways to break through therapeutic barriers, our goal is to broaden the efficacy of RT + ICB to more patients in next generation clinical trials."
"9379050","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As loss of cell cycle regulation is a hallmark of carcinogenesis, identifying novel therapeutic targets aimed at restoring growth control is an important approach to cancer therapy. Endometrial cancer (ECA) is the most common gynecologic malignancy in the US with 49,470 new cases and over 8,190 deaths estimated for 2013. The major objectives of this proposal address mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of estrogen (E2)- induced Type I ECA (85% of ECAs) and a new potential therapy for this disease that involves inhibiting degradation of the tumor suppressor, p27kip1 (p27), a key cell cycle protein that arrests cell proliferation. We reported that E2 induces ubiquitin-mediated degradation of nuclear p27 by its specific E3 ligase, SCF- Skp2/Cks1, in endometrial epithelial (EECs) and ECA cells with increased cell proliferation. Conversely, progesterone (Pg; a therapy for low grade ECA) as well as TGF-ß, increase p27 in the nucleus and inhibit cell proliferation by preventing p27 degradation. Therefore, we provide compelling evidence that p27 is a key target for growth regulation in the endometrium and in endometrial carcinogenesis. We have identified novel small molecule inhibitors of Skp2/Cks1 (Skp2E3LIs) that only increase nuclear p27, which is critical since cytoplasmic p27 mediated migration/metastasis. Furthermore, Skp2E3LIs block both E2-induced degradation of nuclear p27 and proliferation in vitro in ECA cells and {in vivo in mouse EECs}. Importantly, Skp2E3LIs have the potential to be a major therapeutic advancement over current general proteasome inhibitors that indiscriminately block protein degradation including oncogenes. Whereas Skp2/Cks1 causes p27 degradation, the E3 ligase APC/Cdh1 targets Cks1/Skp2 for destruction leaving p27 intact. Interestingly, we show that E2 decreases Cdh1and thereby increases Skp2/Cks1 for p27 degradation whereas Pg and TGF-ß increase Cdh1 to increase nuclear p27. Therefore, p27 degradation can be inhibited both, by increasing Cdh1 or by blocking Skp2. As such, we will test two main hypotheses: 1. that the Cdh1-Skp2/Cks1-p27axis is important in cell cycle dysregulation by the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS); 2. that Skp2E3LIs have significant translational value for the treatment of ECA. We propose to: 1. Use E2, Pg, and TGF-ß as molecular switches to learn how Cdh1 is controlled to affect p27 levels. 2. Show that co-localization of p27 and Cdh1 in human biopsy tissue is a biomarker for positive outcomes of Pg therapy. {3. Perform co-crystallization/NMR structural analysis of Skp2-Cks1-Skp2E3LI complexes for chemically optimizing current lead compounds to define the role of p27 in ECA in vitro and in vivo.} 4. Quantify the effects of Skp2E3LIs on intracellular [nuclear] trafficking of p27 Skp2, and Cks1 together with cell cycle analysis by single cell imaging microscopy. 5. Test Skp2E3LIs for their efficacy in blocking the growth of human ECA tumors in mouse models. As the degradation of nuclear p27 occurs in numerous cancers, our studies should impact the cancer biology field by providing mechanistic insights into the role of the UPS in cancer and the use of Skp2E3LIs as a novel approach to cancer therapy."

Advisory committee The Core will coordinate an annual meeting with the Internal Advisory Committee in which SCCOR progress is presented and critically reviewed. We selected an internal (versus external) committee for two main reasons: (1) the local administrative talent (Department Heads of SCCOR member Departments Cell Biology/Physiology, Genetics, Medicine, Pathology/Immunology, Pediatrics, Physics, and Radiology) are also outstanding scientists and immunologists and so are ideally suited to advise the SCCOR program; and (2) we wanted to maintain flexibility in our choice of outside advisors so that a standing committee was considered less desirable than ad hoc consultants. 3. Consultants The Core will also coordinate visits from external consultants listed in the project and core proposals. As noted above, we opted to use this mechanism for external advice (rather than an external advisory committee) to allow for flexibility in consultant selection as SCCOR research progresses. 4. Budget support The core will be responsible for management of all budgets and for monitoring expenditures for SCCOR investigators. Each investigator will receive a monthly statement detailing the financial activity of their project. Orders for supplies and equipment are placed using an on-line computer service that facilitates cost accounting.

"9257892","Project Summary / Abstract The purpose of the BUSRP Community Engagement Core (CEC) is to direct best practices in community engagement for exposure prevention and intervention. We work with the Boston University Superfund Research Program (BUSRP) Project Leaders, investigators, cores, and staff to fulfil this purpose, and to reduce and prevent exposure to hazardous substances experienced by communities impacted by the New Bedford Harbor Superfund site, and throughout Massachusetts, New England, and the US. Projects 1 and 2 both have human populations and best practice plans for community engagement in their research that have been developed with input of the CEC Leader and partner organizations. The CEC Leader is also a Co- Investigator on Project 2. Both Projects 1 and 2 include investigating the relation of prenatal exposure to chemical and non-chemical stressors with adolescents' risk-taking and related behaviors. Chemicals of concern in these studies include PCBs and PCE. Projects 3-5 directly concern exposures experienced in the areas being studied in Projects 1 and 2 and these Project Leaders are engaged in CEC activities. The long- term goal of Project 3 is to understand the molecular mechanisms by which individual and complex mixtures of Superfund chemicals impair mammalian bone and adipocyte physiology. Project 3 research is very relevant to clinicians who work with children and women of child-bearing age and the broader communities interested in bone and metabolic health. Project 4 and 5 focus on population-level effects in PCB-exposed sentinel animals. The research applies innovative molecular approaches in an ecological context, in order to understand chemical-induced evolutionary changes in signaling pathways involved in the response to Superfund chemicals. The CEC works very closely with Research Translation Core, with the Leaders complementing each other's areas of expertise, skills, and objectives as per each Core. We will work closely as Core Leaders and members of the BUSRP Executive Committee to coordinate community engagement activities in support of all BUSRP projects. Finally, we work closely with the Training Core to ensure that all future scientists produced by our program are experienced at community engagement, and knowledgeable regarding best practices for prevention. Specific activities include community-based exposure assessment in response to community questions in partnership with communities; data interpretation trainings; engaging English, Spanish and Portuguese-speaking populations impacted by New Bedford Harbor in USEPA mitigation strategies, as well as education and engagement to reduce current exposures and prevent future exposures; working with the schools to incorporate SRP Science and lab experiences into the curriculum; engaging SRP scientists in our program and across the country in community engagement best practices focused on developmental and behavioral health in collaboration with NGOs across the US. Our efforts are local, regional, and national in scope."
"9273556","Project IV seeks to identify molecular programs and gestational stages in mice that, if compromised, may cause homeostatic dysfunction, and, by extrapolation to humans, may underlie an increase in risk for the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or other clinical disorders of homeostasis. Life- sustaining homeostatic responses to cardiorespiratory and thermal challenges are regulated by brain serotonergic (5-HT) neurons. Using novel mouse transgenics, we recently established that different homeostatic functions, for example respiratory control In response to CO2 elevation or body temperature control In response to cold, map to distinct ontogenetically defined subtypes of 5-HT neurons. This suggests that molecularly distinct 5-HT neurons mediate distinct functions. In addition, we now know that mice experience a window of heightened vulnerability to homeostatic stressors, spanning postnatal day (P)~5-12, reflecting that these homeostatic functions are developmentally regulated, and may be analogous to the critical period where human SIDS risk is elevated. We also know that male mice show a greater homeostatic sensitivity to 5-HT disruptions. In-line with the higher rate of SIDS in male Infants. Armed with these functional parameters - 5-HT neuron subtype, vulnerable postnatal stage, and gender - and our novel circuitry mapping tools, we propose to Identify molecular programs underlying these homeostatic specializations and vulnerabilities In mice. We hypothesize that critical molecular differences driving homeostatic specializations and their temporal development in 5-HT neurons stem from differences in gene expression and that they can be revealed through systematic comparison among transcriptomes generated from each of our Identified functional classes of medullary 5-HT neurons across postnatal windows Identified as especially vulnerable to homeostatic challenge and across gender (Aim 1). Further, we hypothesize that gestational exposures which elevate SIDS risk do so by perturbing the expression of critical homeostatic specializations, and that these perturbations Involve, at least in part, transcript alterations which are identifiable by comparative transcripfional profiling (Aim 2). Such gestational exposures may not only affect gene expression but also 5-HT neuron activity in the embryo, which in turn may affect the long-term development and postnatal function of homeostatic circuits. Using inducible genetic neuronal 'silencing' tools recently engineered In our lab, we will Identify, In mice, embryonic stages during which 5-HT neuron activity is most critical for development and function of circuits essential for postnatal homeostasis (Aim 3)."
"9264935","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common and third most deadly cancer in the US. Current evidence suggests that CRC incidence is increasing among both men and women younger than 50 years of age, who are also more likely to be diagnosed with late-stage disease. Additionally, there is a significant racial disparity, in that African American men and women experience a higher incidence of colorectal cancer compared to white men and women, and an even higher rate of death from colorectal cancer compared to the white population. Recent studies suggest that infection with Helicobacter pylori, a known gastric-cancer carcinogen, may also increase the risk of CRC, although these findings have been inconsistent. Two recent meta-analyses found statistically significant 40% to 50% increased odds for CRC among H. pylori-positive individuals. However, the majority of the studies surveyed did not take into account the H. pylori sub-type. It is known that, as H. pylori has evolved over 50,000 years to live in the human stomach, the bacteria have become highly diverse genetically. The proposed project builds on our work in the Southern Community Cohort Study, in which we found a statistically significant 60-80% increase in the odds of CRC for individuals sero-positive for one of five specific H. pylori proteins. For colon cancer alone, thes associations were stronger, so that sero- positivity to any of these five proteins was associated with a significant, approximate two-fold increased risk, most prominently for the known H. pylori virulence factor VacA (OR for VacA sero-positivity, 2.24). The association of VacA sero-positivity was particularly strong for CRC that has distant spread (OR, 5.67), among younger (<55 y) individuals (OR, 3.48), and for cancer of the right colon (OR, 3.13). Furthermore, a strong, significant, positive dose-response association across increasing quartiles of VacA antibody level was also observed. The current project seeks to produce the most definitive study to date of the H. pylori-CRC association through evaluation of the association in a large, collaborative nested case-control study (including over 4,000 prospectively-ascertained cases from 10 cohort studies spanning the US, and 1:1 matched controls), assessment of differences in the association by time from blood collection to diagnosis, and examination of the potential interaction of regular aspirin use on the association of H. pylori protein-specific infection with CRC risk. Thus, the current project allows us to thoroughly evaluate the novel association between Helicobacter pylori protein-specific infection and CRC risk, particularly for aggressive disease, building the groundwork for significantly strengthening CRC prevention and screening strategies with a new risk biomarker. Furthermore, this project provides the opportunity to potentially identify an infectious exposure to a common cancer that may be modifiable by a regimen of regular aspirin use, and moreover has already been proven to be modifiable through the use of H. pylori-eradication therapy and, thus, possibly holds great promise as a CRC prevention strategy."
"9390574","Risk for adult diseases or disorders is known to be influenced by the prenatal/early life environment. Building on seminal studies by Barker and colleagues, who reported associations between low birth weight and biological risk for adult disease, support for the ?developmental origins of health and disease? (DOHaD) hypothesis has grown to include early life adversities beyond low birth weight and to extend to outcomes beyond metabolic syndrome. Of particular relevance, prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE), in addition to its teratogenic effects, can program developing neurobiological systems and thus increase risk for diseases/ disorders over the life course. Our CIFASD Developmental Project is the first to identify links among maternal alcohol consumption, inflammation, and child outcomes; unique immune signatures in pregnant women were identified in association with whether or not they consumed alcohol and with neurodevelopmental outcomes of their children. The proposed UO1 builds on these findings to examine immune profiles in pregnant women and children from birth through adulthood. Our working hypothesis is that prenatal alcohol-induced dysregulation of immune/ inflammatory systems will be associated with adverse health, functional and adaptive outcomes, providing insight into factors underlying risk and resilience. Specific Aims are to: 1) Use validation cohorts to confirm the utility of immune parameters as possible biomarkers and predictors of alcohol-related health and neurobehavioral outcomes, by analyzing: a) plasma samples and neurobehavioral outcomes from matched mother-infant or mother-child pairs from Ukraine (Chambers) and San Diego (Chambers, Jones, Mattson), respectively, and a child cohort from Minnesota (Wozniak). Assessment of individuals from different cultural/ethnic, SES, and environmental conditions will provide insight into factors modulating alcohol?s programming effects, and increase understanding of immune variables as biomarkers of alcohol intake and predictive factors for PAE-related outcomes. 2) Extend assessment of the immune system into adulthood with assessment of cohorts from Atlanta (Coles), Seattle (Grant), and British Columbia (Weinberg, Loock, Oberlander, Lutke). We will investigate whether physical/mental health and impaired cognitive and adaptive outcomes are associated with immune/inflammatory system dysregulation resulting from prenatal programming effects of alcohol. For both Aims, we will analyze cytokines/inflammatory markers in plasma, obtain past and current mental/physical health information, and measure neurobehavioral and adaptive outcomes, providing novel insight into links among immune function, cognitive and adaptive function, and health outcomes. Together, these studies bring a new dimension to CIFASD, a focus on DOHAD/health outcomes, a critically important but relatively understudied area. Moreover, as the immune system plays a key role in brain development, this work has broad implications for understanding the role of immune/inflammatory mechanisms in FASD-associated neurobehavioral and adaptive deficits."

"9348588","PROJECT SUMMARY  Rheumatic diseases are heterogeneous across and within conditions in terms of their onset, mechanisms, clinical manifestations, comorbidities and multisystem involvement, disease course and response to treatment, patient experience, and information required for medical decision-making. Within the spectrum of rheumatic diseases, careful and comprehensive measurement of these factors over time can be combined with advanced statistical modeling techniques to define subsets within diseases. Over the past 10 years in the Division of Rheumatology, an integrated clinical/translational research infrastructure embedded within clinical practice has allowed us to establish registries, which couple the longitudinal collection of clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic data with bio specimens and patient-reported information in each of our Centers of Excellence (Arthritis, Lupus, Scleroderma, Myositis, Vasculitis, Sjogren's syndrome, Lyme). Our investigators are now optimally positioned to discover phenotypes reflecting common pathobiologic mechanisms and manifestations, and link these with targeted treatments that substantially improve patient outcomes.  The past 5 years also have witnessed considerable changes in our overall healthcare system and research methodologies, presenting new opportunities and challenges. The complexity of evolving study designs and methods, privacy and security concerns, and regulatory aspects have grown substantially. Our ability to collate vast amounts of clinical and patient-reported outcomes has increased exponentially with EHRs. Against this backdrop are increasing calls to prioritize research that generates results that are meaningful to patients and clinicians who care for them. The Research Management and Patient Integrated Data (RAPID) Core has been specifically created to facilitate clinical and translational research in this changing environment. The overall goal of the RAPID Core is to streamline the process of human subjects research, integrate multiple sources of information, and foster patient-centered research. The Specific Aims of the Core are to: 1) coordinate and oversee regulatory and operational aspects of human subjects research; 2) provide oversight and expertise to efficiently collect and export clinical and research data; and 3) facilitate patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR). The RAPID Core consists of 3 Hubs (Research Management, Clinical Data Integration, and PCOR) to accomplish each of these aims. The Core will be led by researchers and staff with experience across the research continuum and with evolving quantitative and qualitative methodologies.

"9379668","PROJECT SUMMARY Death related to severe infection, or sepsis, is inextricably linked to the refractory failure of one or more organ systems. While advances have been made in understanding key molecular mechanisms by which specific microorganisms cause severe infection, we still have a poor understanding of how a diverse array of human pathogens elicit the rapid progression of systemic disease defined as multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Among children with sepsis, over 90% demonstrate multi-organ dysfunction, providing a clinical imperative to understand fundamental mechanisms by which pediatric sepsis causes MODS. With rising rates of antimicrobial resistance and the refractory nature of MODS, a deeper understanding of how localized infection converts to life-threatening systemic disease is needed. We have demonstrated the role of zinc dependent metalloproteases in the pathogenesis of lethal infection caused by S. aureus and B. fragilis ? two leading etiologic agents of human sepsis. S. aureus ?-toxin utilizes host ADAM10 (A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease 10) as its cellular receptor, triggering untimely, pathologic activation of the metalloprotease. The B. fragilis toxin (BFT) is a zinc dependent metalloprotease similar to ADAM10. ADAM10 and BFT both contribute to lethal infection-associated MODS. Based on these findings, we propose that infection-associated MODS is catalyzed by aberrant activation of host ADAM10. As ADAM10 is ubiquitously expressed and involved in diverse host cellular processes, this metalloprotease is well-positioned to cause the scope of injuries observed in MODS. The primary goal of this proposal is thus to examine the hypothesis that ADAM10 is required for the development of MODS in the setting of severe pneumonia and bloodstream infection caused by key human bacterial and fungal pathogens. This proposal is based on three discoveries: 1) Cell-type specific ADAM10 knockout mice permit the identification of effects of S. aureus ?-toxin on individual cells in lethal infection, revealing that these depend on toxin-mediated activation of ADAM10 and pathologic cleavage of native ADAM10 substrates. 2) Infection-related organ dysfunction is a composite of ADAM10 action on discrete cells, integrated in the tissue over time. 3) A specific polymorphism in human ADAM10 predisposes toward the development of severe sepsis, irrespective of the inciting pathogen. Extending these observations toward the in vivo analysis of the broader role of ADAM10 in MODS as proposed will provide an opportunity to examine the innovative hypothesis that a host metalloprotease is critical for MODS. As specific inhibitors of ADAM10 have demonstrated safety in human clinical trials, knowledge gained from these studies may enable the evaluation of a novel class of therapeutics for infection-associated MODS."
"9313956","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Huntington's disease (HD) represents an age-dependent neurodegenerative disease family including Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD) diseases. These diseases are characterized by selective neurodegeneration that is caused by misfolded proteins in an age-dependent manner. In HD, the disease protein huntingtin (htt) carries an expanded polyglutamine repeat, accumulates in the brain, forms aggregates as patients become old, and causes progressive neurological symptoms. Given the known genetic mutation in HD and its well-characterized neuropathology, HD makes an ideal model for investigating how selective neuropathology occurs in an age-dependent manner. Most previous studies focused on the effect of mutant htt on neuronal cells and revealed that N-terminal fragments of mutant htt are misfolded and cause cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous pathological events in a variety of animal models. In the brain, the majority of cells are non-neuronal cells that provide essential support to the survival and function of neuronal cells. These non-neuronal cells mainly consist of three types of glial cells: astrocytes, microglial cells and oligodendrocytes. It is known that oligodendrocytes produce myelin proteins for myelination of axons, and astrocytes can release neurotrophins to support neuronal survival and function. However, whether mutant htt in glial cells affects these important functions remains to be investigated. We have established transgenic mouse models that express mutant htt specifically in astrocytes (GFAP-160Q) or oligodendrocytes (PLP-150Q). Both HD mouse models develop age-dependent neurological phenotypes, suggesting that mutant htt in glial cells affects glial function during aging and critically contribute to the age-dependent clinical phenotypes. We also found that in our GFAP-160Q HD transgenic mice, mutant htt can reduce BDNF release from astrocytes and cause demyelination or neuronal death reminiscent the pathological events in previous HD mouse models and human HD patient's brains. In this application, we propose three aims to investigate how expression of mutant htt in glial cells causes neuronal dysfunction and neurological phenotypes in HD transgenic mice. Aim 1 is to examine the effect of mutant htt on secretion of neurotrophic factors from glial cells. Aim 2 is to explore how mutant htt in glial cells causes age-dependent neurological phenotypes and neuropathology. Aim 3 is to investigate the protective effects of reducing htt in glial cells or improving glial function in HD mouse brains. These studies will help understand the mechanisms for age-dependent neuropathology in HD and the contribution of glial htt to HD pathology. Because glial cells are a desirable transplant population for therapy, the findings from our study may also provide a new therapeutic target for treating HD."

In their early years in the program, the AHRQ/NRSA traineeships represent our students' largest and most important source of funding and are crucial in our efforts to attract high quality students. Although some of our faculty direct research centers and hold endowed chairs that provide research assistantships for our doctoral students, those sources of support are not sufficient to accommodate all of our students or all of their research interests. We recently have added faculty in important areas such as patient-centered outcomes research, patient safety and quality, industrial and systems engineering, demography, and analysis of public opinion data, and we rely on AHRQ/NRSA traineeships, in part, to provide stable, multi-year support for talented students whose interests lie in those areas. Although our doctoral program occasionally admits students directly from undergraduate programs, the vast majority of our students have a masters level degree and several years of work experience. Our doctoral curriculum has a strong core curriculum in statistics and econometrics, research design, sociology, economics, epidemiology, and research ethics. Our students then choose one of the following areas of emphasis: Multidisciplinary Social Sciences, Sociology of Health and Illness, Health Decision Science, Health Organization and Management Science, Clinical Outcomes Research, Health Policy, and Health Economics. Alternatively, students can obtain a formal minor in another department in the University. Our students typically complete the program in about five years, although some have finished the program in as little as three years. We are requesting a total of 13 traineeships (slots) per year with the intent of guaranteeing support for five students for thei first year and four students for their second and third years of their doctoral training program."

"9516087","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Chronic inflammation promotes tumor development, as infectious and chemical agents, as well as chronic inflammatory disorders, have been shown to increase the risk of developing tumors. Solid tumors are heavily invested with tumor-associated macrophages, which promote angiogenesis, immunosuppression and tumor growth, progression, and metastasis. Targeting the mechanisms controlling myeloid cell recruitment to tumors is a promising approach to suppressing tumor growth and metastasis. We recently found that myeloid cell recruitment to tumors depends on PI3kinase ? (p110?). Pharmacological or genetic blockade of p110? suppressed myeloid cell adhesion to endothelium and recruitment to tumors, as well as angiogenesis, growth and metastasis of implanted and spontaneous tumors, revealing that p110? is an important therapeutic target in oncology. Importantly, p110? is the major PI3-kinase isoform expressed in myeloid cells; furthermore, myeloid cells are the main physiological source of p110?. Selective inhibitors of p110? could thus serve as therapeutics to suppress tumor malignancy by blocking diverse pathways promoting tumor inflammation. The aims of this proposal are 1) to determine the molecular pathways by which PI3kinase gamma regulates myeloid cell trafficking during inflammation, tumor progression and metastasis, 2) to evaluate the role of PI3K? in the regulation of immunosuppression during tumor progression, and 3) to evaluate the potential of PI3- kinase ? to serve as a therapeutic target for the treatment of breast cancer."
"9302394","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mechanosensitivity of the detrusor is defined as the ability of smooth muscle cells to generate mechanical activity independent of external stimuli. During bladder filling, there is usually no parasympathetic outflow from the spinal cord, however, the bladder develops tone and also exhibits non- synchronized local contractions and relaxations. Pathological changes in mechanosensory mechanisms may lead to the development of detrusor overactivity (DO) which is a co-symptom of several dysfunctions of the lower urinary tract including overactive bladder, obstructed bladder, urinary incontinence, and bladder pain syndrome. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that impaired mechanosensation and mechanotransduction in bladder smooth muscle cells (BSMC) results in the abnormal response of the human bladder to physiological stretch and detrusor overactivity due to the changes in mechano-gated two-pore domain (K2p, KCNK) K+ channels. Animal data and our preliminary results from the human detrusor suggest that stretch-activated two-pore domain (K2p, KCNK) K+ channels play a critical role in bladder mechanosensitivity. We also established that TREK-1 channel is a predominantly expressed member of stretch-activated K2p channels in the human detrusor. Specific Aim 1 will identify differences in the level of expression and function of stretch-activated K+ (K2p) channels in human bladder smooth muscle cells in patients without and with detrusor overactivity. Specific Aim 2 will evaluate interactions between TREK-1 and cytoskeleton (actin microfilaments, caveolin, membrane lipids) in human BSMC and compare the role of TREK-1 modulating proteins in normal vs. overactive human detrusor. Specific Aim 3 will test the efficacy of gene therapies (gene silencing by siRNA and gene activation by saRNA) in modulating the expression and function of TREK-1 in human BSMC in order to effectively regulate an abnormal response of the overactive detrusor to stretch during bladder filling. The overall objective of this proposal is to investigat cellular and molecular mechanisms of abberant mechanosensitivity and altered response of the human detrusor to physiological stretch associated with increased myogenic tone and spontaneous non-voiding contractions in patients with DO. Proposed studies will clarify the cellular mechanisms of mechanosensitivity and mechanotransduction in the human bladder and in patients with idiopathic DO, and provide new information for the development of new pharmacological interventions and innovative strategies for the treatment of urinary bladder dysfunctions."
"9179168","Project Summary/Abstract NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) belongs to a class of Nod-like-receptor (NLR) proteins that trigger the assembly of the inflammasome, a molecular platform that mediates caspase-1 activation and processing and secretion of biologically active IL-1? and IL-18. In addition to its critical role in innate immunity, dysregulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome has been linked to both inherited and acquired inflammatory disorders, such as Cryopyrin-associated autoinflammatory syndrome, gout, Crohn?s disease, Alzheimer?s disease, diabetes and atherosclerosis. Despite the medical importance of the NLRP3 inflammasome, the mechanism by which it is activated remains elusive. Using a proteomics approach to reveal critical factors that interact with NLRP3 in macrophages, we identified the Nek7 protein kinase as a NLRP3- interacting protein that is essential for the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Nek7 is associated with NLRP3 in the resting state, and this interaction is enhanced during NLRP3 activation. In macrophages depleted with Nek7, caspase-1 activation and IL-1? secretion are abrogated in response to stimuli that trigger NLRP3 activation. In contrast, Nek7 is not required for the activation of the NLRC4 and AIM2 inflammasomes. The critical and specific role of Nek7 in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is unexpected because Nek7 is a member of a kinase family that regulates cytokinesis. The goal of this proposal is to define the molecular mechanism by which Nek7 regulates the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Based on our preliminary results, our primary hypothesis is that the Nek7 protein kinase regulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation by promoting the assembly of the inflammasome. Furthermore, we hypothesize that Nek7 contributes to the induction and/or progression of inflammatory disease. To test these hypotheses, we propose characterizing the mechanism by which Nek7 regulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation and the role of Nek7 in vivo using animals models of inflammation that rely on IL-1? secretion via NLRP3. Understanding the role of Nek7 in NLRP3 inflammasome activation is expected to provide critical insight into the development of novel therapeutic strategies for inflammatory diseases."
"9449794","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Late adolescence and early adulthood is a developmental period marked by increasing autonomy and heightened rates of health risk behaviors, and is typically accompanied by the transition from living at home to living independently of parents. This increased independence can be a risk factor for all adolescents, but may be even more detrimental for adolescents who are managing chronic diseases (i.e. type 1 diabetes) as they may experience prolonged periods of poor control leading to both short and long term health consequences. Little is known about the contextual factors and issues which this population faces, and even less is known about strategies that are used to overcome potential barriers to diabetes management. Dr. Stupiansky has extensive training in health behavior, including how contextual factors relate to health risk decision-making such as condomless sex and alcohol use. However, the current application will further specialize his training to understand the metabolic and clinical aspects of diabetes management so that he is better prepared to examine the role of contextual factors in facilitating or inhibiting proper disease management. Additionally, he seeks additional training to acquire skills to develop technology-based interventions that will be informed using strategies identified by participants in this research project. With mentorship from Dr. David Marrero and a panel of clinical, educational, and technological experts; Dr. Stupiansky intends to perform formative qualitative research using focus groups of pre- and post-transition adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Themes that are elicited and identified from the focus groups will then be used to develop an interactive, multi-media tool in which adolescents can view stories of diabetes management experiences as relayed by their peers. This important and innovative project will represent a significant contribution to research on diabetes management during late adolescence and early adulthood, and culminate in future research applications to perform technology-based interventions aimed at improving clinical care outcomes for all adolescents with diabetes. The training plan and research strategy in this application will give Dr. Stupiansky the time, resources, and mentorship that he needs to succeed as an independent researcher and allow him to make significant, translational contributions to the field."
"9355718","Studying complex neurological function and disease requires imaging technologies that can provide a comprehensive view of the mammalian brain with high spatiotemporal resolution. Ideally, these technologies should be scalable from small brain regions in rodents to whole-brain imaging in larger organisms such as non- human primates. They should provide access to endogenous signals such as hemodynamics, and be able to image neuron-specific signals such as calcium and activity-dependent gene expression using targeted reporters. They should also be compatible with freely moving subjects to enable behavioral studies, and should allow simultaneous electrophysiology and targeted modulation. Finally, they should be non-invasive or minimally invasive to enable the possibility of future clinical translation. No existing technology fulfills these criteria because optical and electrophysiological techniques face inherent limitations in scaling, while functional magnetic resonance imaging has relatively low spatiotemporal resolution and severely constrains behavioral paradigms. Recently, functional ultrasound was introduced as a revolutionary technique that can image neural activity non-invasively with more than an order of magnitude improved spatiotemporal resolution compared to fMRI (<100µm and <10ms), using transducers that can be mounted on freely moving animals. In rodents, fUS has been used to image activity patterns associated with epileptic seizures, whisker stimulation, olfactory perception and resting state connectivity, and studies are underway to demonstrate the use of fUS in larger animals and pediatric patients. In its present form, fUS tracks changes in blood flow arising from neurovascular coupling. While this already provides unprecedented brain imaging performance, it is limited by the relatively low strength of intrinsic hemodynamic signals and the lack of reporters to connect ultrasound more directly to neural activity. Here, we propose to take the next major leap in ultrasonic functional imaging of the brain by developing biomolecular imaging agents that enhance fUS signals by more than two orders of magnitude and enable direct imaging of activity-dependent gene expression and calcium signaling in genetically targeted neurons. As part of this work, we will also demonstrate the ability of fUS to image brain activity in non-human primates in combination with electrical recording and pharmacological modulation. If we are successful in these goals, the resulting technology will provide neuroscience researchers with truly revolutionary capabilities, especially for the study of larger animal models. Furthermore, the potential merger of of this technology with ultrasonic neuromodulation (which uses a different regime of frequencies and intensities) will open the possibility of all-acoustic interfaces to simultaneously image and control neural activity in freely moving subjects."
"8112381","Numerous studies examining atherosclerotic lesions from human and animal models have  established the central role of the macrophage in atherosclerosis. Despite these observations, it is still  unclear how the multiple pro- and anti-inflammatory capabilities of the macrophage are balanced within  lesions. One potentially important mechanism for them to regulate their function is by the rapid modulation of  the repertoire of proteins expressed on their cell surface through proteolytic shedding. In addition to  dynamically altering the cell surface constituents, shedding also leads to the release of soluble ectodomains  with distinct biological properties. This proposal will focus on the ADAM family of proteases that have gained  recognition as primary effectors of ectodomain shedding.  Early lesions of atherosclerosis are characterized by lipid-filled macrophages. Scavenger receptors  are responsible for this massive accumulation of cholesterol, and their significance for atherogenesis is  highlighted by multiple gene knockout studies. Fas ligand (FasL) is a key cell surface regulator of  macrophage apoptosis and activation. Both scavenger receptors and FasL can be proteolytically cleaved  from the cell surface resulting in down-regulated cellular expression. The release of soluble scavenger  receptor can inhibit foam cell formation in vitro and in vivo, while FasL is proteolytically released in both  active and inactive forms. Thus, proteolytic shedding of scavenger receptors and FasL could modulate  lesion initiation and progression. However, the enzymes responsible for their shedding have not been fully  characterized. In Aim 1, we will determine the proteases involved in the shedding of scavenger receptors  and FasL, and the functional significance of shedding on atherogenesis will be examined in Aim 4 by  expressing uncleavable mutants of these substrates.  In addition to possible effects on lesion initiation, ectodomain shedding may also contribute to lesion  progression and plaque rupture. Macrophage activation induces the shedding a multitude of inflammatory  mediators, and ADAM17 has been shown to be responsible for the shedding of several of these. In Aim 4,  we will test the role of ADAM17 in lesion initiation, progression and plaque rupture by genetically modulating  its expression in macrophages. In addition, proteomic approaches will be utilized to identify novel substrates  for ADAM17 potentially involved in atherosclerosis (Aim 2), and to determine the role played by oxidants in  regulating the activity of this enzyme (Aim 3) in collaboration with Project 4."

None of the existing AHRQ-supported T32 programs specifically focus in these clinical domains. Therefore, the overall goal of the proposed UC Davis Quality, Safety, And Comparative Effectiveness Research Training (QSCERT) T32 program, led by Joy Melnikow, MD, MPH, is to establish a multidisciplinary, postdoctoral training program in quality, safety, and comparative effectiveness research with a particular emphasis on training researchers from all relevant disciplines in surgical, trauma, and urgent/ emergency care quality and outcomes. Given UC Davis' extensive research training and academic infrastructure, QSCERT has the capacity to nurture such a cadre of researchers. QSCERT will admit three postdoctoral fellows (MD or PhD) per year to participate in a two-year training program (in special circumstances, scholars may be recruited for one year). The QSCERT curriculum includes the core requirements of didactic training, career development training, and mentored research experience, with the option to earn a Master in Public Health (MPH) or Master in Advanced Study (MAS) degree. For didactic training, an effective array of courses and career development workshops have been chosen from established training programs to form the core QSCERT curriculum, providing scholars with the core competencies and in depth knowledge required for successful careers in quality, safety and comparative effectiveness research. For mentored training, scholars will be matched to a primary faculty mentor and a multidisciplinary mentorship team drawn from institutional Centers (the Center for Healthcare Policy and Research, Cancer Center, Center for Poverty Research, and the Institute of Population Health Improvement), the Departments of Medicine, Surgery, Emergency Medicine, and Public Health Sciences, and the Betty Irene School of Nursing. As home to one of the National Center for Research Resources' (NCRR) vanguard Clinical and Translational Science Centers, UC Davis has a strong track record in developing and maintaining interdisciplinary research programs. Through the Center for Healthcare Policy and Research, UC Davis has also built a prominent multidisciplinary research program in quality, safety, and CER, with a successful primary care faculty development program supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA).

"8112392","Specific components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulate in atherosclerosis and promote  the inflammatory phase of vascular disease. We have focused on two of these components,  hyaluronan and versican, which interact with each other to form higher ordered molecular  complexes and not only contribute to ECM expansion during the development of vascular disease  but also have a dramatic effect influencing the phenotype of arterial smooth muscle cells. Recently,  we found that an ECM enriched in hyaluronan and versican promotes the adhesion of monocytes in  a hyaluronan dependent manner suggesting that these specific ECM components may form part of  what could be considered a pro-inflammatory ECM. These observations have led us to hypothesize  that hyaluronan and versican are produced by vascular cells in response to specific inflammatory  stimuli and contribute to the formation of an ECM that binds monocytes. We further hypothesize  that monocyte/macrophage also synthesize these ECM components in response to inflammatory  stimuli and degrade hyaluronan and versican and that a balance between these two activities  partially regulates the phenotype of the monocyte/macrophage. To test this hypothesis, we will  have 4 specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will identify the full nature of this specialized ECM and test the  requirements for these components for these components in hyaluronan-dependent monocyte  adhesion. In Aim 2, we will explore the role that hyperlipidemia and modified lipids play in the  generation of this ECM and define the changes in versican and hyaluronan during the development  of atherosclerosis. Aim 3 will focus on the synthesis and degradation of versican and hyaluronan  by the monocyte/macrophage and the impact of these ECM components monocyte/macrophage  proliferation, adhesion and migration.

Along the pathway, selective utilization of receptors is a potential mechanism for generating versatility. The in vivo role of the individual receptors in the lung mesoderm and epithelium has been a major interest in our group. In separate studies, we have used epithelial- or mesodermal-specific cre mice to inactivate Alk5 or T?R2, and examined the consequences in a highly systematic fashion. As a consequence, we now have an insight, however limited, into the role of each receptor in TGF? function. In the last cycle of this project, in addition to completing the original specific aims, we also collected preliminary data on the specific role of Alk5 in the lung mesoderm by genetic & molecular approaches. The preliminary findings collectively point to a unified underlying theme; that Alk5-mediated TGF? signaling is critical to progenitor/stem cell biology in various lung compartments. The simplified observed changes in the absence of mesodermal Alk5 function are, 1) reduced basal cell population in the trachea, 2) profoundly abnormal cartilage formation in the trachea, and 3) a major shift in the balance between lipofibroblasts versus myofibroblasts in the lung parenchyma. The phenotypes are fully penetrant, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Elucidating these mechanisms is the goal of this application. Hypothesis: Mesodermal Alk5-mediated TGF? signaling controls the emergence/maintenance or differentiation of progenitor/stem cells in the lung. We will test the validity of this hypothesis by the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1: To Determine The Mechanisms by Which Inactivation of Alk5 in The Pulmonary Mesoderm Depletes Basal Cells. Specific Aim 2: To Determine The Role of Alk5 in Tracheal Morphogenesis. Specific Aim 3: To Determine Potential Phenotype Plasticity in Alk5-Regulated Lipofibroblast versus  Myofibroblast Differentiation. Specific Aim 4: To Determine Whether Pulmonary Fibrosis Can be Rescued or Contained (i.e., Limited) by Inactivation of Alk5 & Trans-Differentiation of Activated Myofibroblasts to Lipofibroblasts. By completion of this work, we hope to have unraveled the specific role played by Alk5-mediated TGF? signaling in the ontogeny of key epithelial and mesenchymal progenitor/stem cell populations in the trachea and the lung parenchyma. The studies proposed here also offer the unique opportunity of examining, from a novel perspective the specific role of Alk5 in pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis in a mouse model."
"9207549","STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND COMPUTATIONAL MODELING CORE  PROJECT SUMMARY The Statistical Analysis and Computational Modeling Core is operated by the Division of Nonhuman Primate Systems Biology to provide the resources needed for the processing, management, and analysis of high- throughput data. The computational infrastructure and analytical capabilities provided by the Core are unmatched among the National Primate Research Centers and can be accessed by external investigators through collaboration with Division scientists or directly through the Core using a fee-for-service mechanism. The overall goal of the Core is to help investigators better understand and exploit the information obtained from nonhuman primate models. To do so, it is essential to maintain, plan, and grow the Core?s computational infrastructure to meet the demand of cutting edge technologies. The Specific Aims of the Core are: 1) Provide the IT infrastructure and laboratory information management system for high-throughput data management and analysis. Considering the rapid advances in high-throughput technologies (especially deep sequencing technologies), the Core supports the need for a large computational infrastructure with adequate IT support and it provides a laboratory information management system for efficient project and data management. The Core is constantly improving existing infrastructure, including integration with the WaNPRC IT system and the exploration of hybrid models of combining in-house computational infrastructure with the latest commercial cloud computing. 2) Provide study design, quality control, and primary processing of high-throughput data. After investigators consult with Core personnel on study design, technological choices, and analytical options, the Core employs a standardized data processing pipeline that includes extensive quality control of raw high- throughput datasets, read alignment, abundance quantification and normalization, differential expression, and functional enrichment analysis. Evaluation of emerging computational methods and software is ongoing; as needed current computational pipelines are updated or new ones are developed. 3) Provide advanced analysis of high-throughput multidimensional data. Beyond standard practices outlined in Aim 2 above, Core personnel advise investigators on practical options for advanced data mining. Depending on the study, various strategies can be employed such as integration with additional datasets, network analysis, noncoding RNA function prediction, expression quantitative trait loci analysis, digital cell quantification, time series analysis, target and drug prediction, and association of omics signatures with phenotypic outcomes. All new analytical capabilities developed by the Division are made available through this Core."

"9304335","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this renewal of his mid-career investigator award in patient oriented-research, the candidate, Dr. Seward Rutkove, proposes to develop his mentoring efforts with young investigators in neurological research while continuing the pursuit of his long-term career goal of improving neuromuscular diagnostic techniques. Dr. Rutkove plans to mentor two specific groups of individuals, as he has been doing devotedly since his first K24 was funded in 2008. The first group of individuals consists of junior neurology faculty members, most of who work outside of Dr. Rutkove's subspecialty of neuromuscular disease. For these individuals, he will continue to hold regular, one-on-one meetings and will continue to organize a faculty seminar series to help share and generate research ideas. In addition, he will expand a 3X/year grant review and discussion meeting in which investigators, both junior and more senior, can examine individual researcher's specific aims and research ideas in an open forum. The second group of mentees generally consists of residents and fellows whose long- term goal is to become a successful patient-oriented researcher in neuromuscular disease, but who have not yet identified a specific area of research. For these individuals, Dr. Rutkove will take a more hands-on approach with regular one-on-one meetings and detailed guidance in identifying potential areas of research. It is also this group of individuals who will benefit most directly from Dr. Rutkove's proposed K-24-supported research in quantitative diagnostic ultrasound techniques for the evaluation of neuromuscular disease, since this area offers broad opportunities for new research directions and opportunities. Specifically, Dr. Rutkove's proposed research plan focuses on the development of a variety of innovative ultrasound-based tools for the assessment of muscle, including automated signal decomposition of the backscattered radiofrequency data, computer-assisted image segmentation, and volumetric, electrographic, anisotropic, and entropy-based analyses. These techniques will be applied to a broad group of adult subjects with neuromuscular disease, providing ample opportunity for mentees to both participate directly in patient-oriented research and to identify areas of research interest of ther own. The environment supporting this work is rich and includes the resources at the Department of Neurology at Harvard Medical School/Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where Dr. Rutkove is based. In addition to these mentoring and research activities, during the funding period, Dr. Rutkove also plans on writing and publishing a guide for researchers interested in establishing a career in patient-oriented research, through Springer publishing. At the conclusion of the research period, Dr. Rutkove expects to have advanced the area of clinical neuromuscular disease research while helping launch the successful careers of a new set of clinical investigators."
"9345703","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our recently completed Phase 1 animal studies demonstrated the ability of our novel second generation partial (p)MHC construct, DR?1-hMOG-35-55, to treat acute and chronic EAE with potency comparable to the parent RTL1000 molecule (pDR2-MOG-35-55) in matched DR2-Tg mice and in DR2 negative mismatched mice. Having met our Phase 1 milestones, our Phase II application will produce a fully humanized DR?1-hMOG-35-55 molecule and assemble preclinical data necessary to support a pre-IND meeting with FDA, at which critical input will be obtained in order to enable the filing of a Phase 1 safety and tolerability study in humans. These data will include characterization of the pharmacokinetics (PK), toxicokinetics (TK) and downstream effects of potential anti-drug antibody (ADA) production. Additionally, this study will assess as an in vivo biomarker the intrinsic activity of DR?1-hMOG-35-55 to inhibit peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) expression of CD74, the major cellular receptor for macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) that has been implicated in MS disease progression both in the literature and in samples from MS subjects. Our proposed studies are patterned after the preclinical development plan that enabled RTL1000 human clinical trials and are designed to stage DR?1- hMOG-35-55 for cGMP manufacture and formal preclinical studies necessary for a Phase 1 clinical trial in human subjects. The clinical protocol to be supported by these preclinical studies will generally follow that used for RTL1000 (Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Phase 1, Dose-Escalation Study of the Safety of a Single Dose of RTL1000 in Subjects with Relapsing Remitting or Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis) which demonstrated that RTL1000 was safe and well tolerated at doses <60mg (1,000µg/kg). Doses of DR?1-hMOG- 35-55 to be infused in the human Phase 1 trial will be guided by pre-IND discussions with FDA and will depend on the minimal effective dose (MED) as well as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) to be determined for both sexes in this proposal. Data from our Phase 1 STTR has established that a higher dose of DR?1-hMOG-35-55 is required for inhibiting T cell activation in vitro and for treatment of chronic EAE in females vs. males, thus necessitating establishment of separate MEDs and overlapping efficacy curves to yield a common dose range. It is anticipated that these studies will facilitate filing of a successful IND for initiating therapeutic trials with DR?1- hMOG-35-55 in subjects with MS."
"9324481","To date, the only vaccine trial (RV144) that has shown any protective efficacy against HIV acquisition is based on a poxvirus prime?protein boost immunization strategy. Although the efficacy achieved was modest (~31%), these findings provide a strong rationale to seek improvements for the prime-boost immunization approach and to gain better insight on the nature of the protective immunity achieved. In this application, we seek to improve responses to prime boost immunization by a combination of three independent approaches: (i) to present stabilized trimeric Env spikes on virus-like particles (VLP) as immunogens for vaccinia virus prime and VLP boost; (ii) to incorporate stabilized trimeric envelope (Env) from multiple isolates as polyvalent VLP immunogen to increase the breadth of response; and (iii) to explore approaches that may increase the number of SOSIP trimer spikes on VLP. Our overall working hypothesis is that the protective efficacy of prime-boost immunization can be improved by optimizing immunogen and immunization regimen to enhance the breadth and potency of both neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibody responses that have been associated with protection in human and/or non-human primate models. Specifically, we hypothesize that by presenting stabilized trimeric Env on VLP in the poxvirus-protein prime boost regimen, we will be able to enhance neutralizing antibody responses, and by using polyvalent Env and increasing the density of Env spikes on the VLP immunogens, we will further amplify the breadth and the potency of response. The enhanced breadth and potency of both neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibody responses, including V1/V2-directed antibodies and those that mediate antiviral effector functions, such as ADCC, will contribute to the protective efficacy of the poxvirus-protein prime boost immunization platform. The Specific Aims of this proposal are: (1) To determine the structure and the antigenic and immunogenic profiles of stabilized Env trimers incorporated into VLP; (2) To determine if stabilized Env trimers from multiple isolates can be incorporated on VLP and if such polyvalent vaccines when used in a prime/boost regimen will increase the breadth of Nab and non-Nab responses; (3) To determine if cytoplasmic tail modifications will increase the density of stabilized Env spikes on VLP and if increased Env density will enhance the breadth and potency of Env specific responses; and (4) To examine if immunization regimens down-selected from the preceding studies in rabbits can be translated to macaques. If successful, insights obtained from these studies will inform the clinical development of vaccines and vaccine strategies that may be more effective than those used in RV144 to prevent HIV-1 acquisition in humans."
"9407663","PROJECT SUMMARY Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is the single largest cause of death worldwide. A heart attack or myocardial infarction (MI) results from limitation of coronary blood flow to the heart, causing ischemia and irreversible death of cardiomyocytes. The ultimate size of an infarct correlates with the degree of deterioration of heart function, compromise of contractile reserve, and the likelihood of mortality from heart failure (HF). Prompt restoration of arterial perfusion with thrombolytic and antiplatelet therapy during percutaneous coronary interventions has led to a decline in acute mortality from MI. However, the prevalence of HF among survivors has been augmented, because irreversible cardiomyocyte death results in residual ischemia and myocardial scarring causing left ventricular dysfunction. The failure of human adult cardiomyocytes to regenerate themselves endogenously, and couple successfully with surviving myocardium following an infarction, constitutes a major clinical problem. This is compounded by the lack of adjunctive treatments, pharmacologic or cellular, that can be administered in conjunction with reperfusion to successfully stimulate regeneration of heart muscle. Promotion of endogenous cardiomyocyte regeneration in the ischemic-infarcted heart, with concomitant reduction of scar size, would offer a powerful new treatment of this devastating disease and its adverse pathophysiologic consequences. Inhibition of a specific combination of four microRNAs (miR-99, miR-100, let-7a and let-7c) is a critical regulator of cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation and heart regeneration in zebrafish. The sequences and target proteins of these four microRNAs (miRs) are conserved in humans. In vivo, adeno-associated virus (AAV) delivery of inhibitors of these miRs into the hearts of mice with a permanent MI increases cardiomyocyte regeneration which was confirmed by the expression of proliferation and cytokinesis markers, scar tissue regression and heart functional improvement. JAAN Biotherapeutics L.L.C. has developed an optimized, single virus formulation, JBT-miR2 that simultaneously expresses inhibitors to miR-99/100 and let-7a/c. Use of this AAV2, cross packaged into AAV9 capsids (AAV2/9) allows for temporal expression, cardiac tropism, and is non integrative, minimizing potential off-target side effects. JBT-miR2 constitutes an innovative approach for regeneration of human cardiomyocytes. The proposed research in Aim 1 of this Phase I study will determine whether JBT-miR2 can regenerate murine heart muscle after a transient 60 minute ischemic injury when administered intravenously either immediately after reperfusion or one week after reperfusion. [Aim 2 will establish cardiac and tissue distribution of the virus, off-target histopathology, pleiotropic effects, metabolic function blood tests and electrophysiological changes.] Aim 1 is critical to confirm efficacy and timing of delivery of JBT-miR2 to promote cardiomyocyte regeneration. Whereas Aim 2 provides information on the safety of the virus. These studies are pivotal for future preclinical and clinical study design."
"9480119","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol use disorders (AUD) cost billions of dollars in lost work time, crime, and medical complications, in addition to incalculable human misery. At the heart of all addiction disorders is a tendency to prefer the immediate reward of intoxication over all other future rewards, such as family, career development, and dignity. While research in this area has focused on impulsive choices for immediate smaller money rewards, versus larger delayed money rewards, the actual choice pattern that is made in AUD is immediate intoxication versus other larger delayed rewards. Understanding the cerebral vulnerabilities that may lead individuals to impulsive drinking instead requires assessing the brain mechanisms involved in the relative value of immediately present alcohol versus other rewards that are remote in time. By understanding the brain areas involved, their function in at-risk subjects, and how such brain activity can be manipulated using behavioral methods, we can better target addiction treatment.  Aim 1 will demonstrate that measuring alcohol versus money choice is a better predictor of alcohol problems than the more standard money versus money choice. Aim 2 will utilize functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine how risk factors alter brain activity related to immediate alcohol choice. Aim 3 will determine how regional brain activity is biased by external stimuli (relapse triggers) during alcohol-related decision making. Aim 4 will determine how regional brain activity is biased by non-drug events that have the potential to bias choice away from intoxication. Aim 4, in particular, will inform clinical treatment of addictions by showing the mechanisms by which future orientation can alter addictive behavior.  By utilizing a more precise model of AUD choice, the findings will bring the field of alcohol research closer to uncovering the brain mechanisms of this devastating disorder. In the course of performing these studies, the Primary Investigator, Dr. Brandon Oberlin, will receive extensive training and guidance from his mentor, Dr. David Kareken, and his advisory committee. Augmented by advanced coursework and supplemental education at the Indiana University School of Medicine, this grant mechanism will support and prepare him for his career as an independent scientist in the field of addiction research."
"9357629","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biological pathways represent knowledge about molecules, processes and their interactions. Maps of such pathways are used to design and analyze experiments, and for predicting the behavior of biological systems. Pathway information is extremely difficult for biologists to use in its current fragmented and incomplete state, involving a large amount of time and effort to wade through, piece together and analyze. The Pathway Commons research resource is being developed to overcome this roadblock by providing researchers with a convenient single point of access to diverse biological pathway information translated to a common data language. This project is an important step towards the development of a complete and integrated computable map of the cell across all species and developmental stages. Pathway Commons promotes and supports convergence, by the community, to a truly integrated computable and searchable representation of cellular biological processes. Pathway Commons does not compete with or duplicate efforts of pathway databases or software tool providers. Existing database groups provide pathway curation, while Pathway Commons provides mechanism and technology for adding value, disseminating, and reducing duplication of effort. Collaboration with user and database groups is a central component, driven by the desire for maximum synergy and efficiency. The Pathway Commons resource will aggregate datasets from multiple major pathway databases; translate, store, validate, index, integrate, hyperlink and maintain the information for maximum quality access; freely deliver pathway information to the scientific public, both academic and commercial, using advanced internet technology; and, provide open-source end user software for pathway browsing and analysis. User support and training for Pathway Commons and related resources will be freely available to the scientific community."

Dr. Hellmuth is establishing herself as a junior investigator conducting patient-oriented clinical research in geriatric neuroHIV, including the neuropathogenesis of HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND) and approaches to accurately diagnose, treat and prevent this condition. This K23 will provide Dr. Hellmuth with the resources and support essential to accomplish the following goals: (1) to gain proficiency in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker analysis and methodologies; (2) to advance her understanding of the indicators of neurodegeneration, including interpretation of cerebrospinal (CSF) neurodegenerative biomarkers and amyloid PET scans; (3) to gain advanced skills in longitudinal neuroimaging techniques and statistical analyses addressing multivariable and longitudinal modeling; and (5) primary mentorship in the operations of clinical research. To achieve these goals, Dr. Hellmuth has assembled a mentoring team of a primary mentor, Dr. Victor Valcour (HIV-associated cognitive disorders; multimodal neuroimaging in HIV; clinical research in geriatric neuroHIV); and two co- mentors, Dr. Gil Rabinovici (multi-modal neuroimaging in Alzheimer?s disease (AD); biomarkers that improve diagnostic accuracy of AD) and Dr. Henrik Zetterberg (clinical neurochemistry; CSF and plasma biomarkers for the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders, including AD). The proposed research project addresses the diagnostic dilemma of how to accurately diagnose HIV+ elders with cognitive impairment, as their age increases the risk for an Alzheimer?s disease (AD) diagnosis, however the symptoms could reflect HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND). Dr. Hellmuth will examine a longitudinal panel of CSF biomarkers of AD, ones that are perturbed in some reports of HIV patients, in a unique clinical sample: HIV+ elders with mild symptomatic cognitive impairment who have had AD neuropathology ruled out by amyloid PET scan, and are virally suppressed with antiretroviral therapy. Through this, she will establish the utility of these CSF AD biomarkers in HIV+ elders on treatment, explore the associations between these CSF AD biomarkers and markers of persistent CSF immune activation, and see how both AD and immune activation markers can predict accelerated brain atrophy in HAND. Dr. Hellmuth?s K23 training will prepare her to conduct independent, clinical research in geriatric neuroHIV using CSF biomarkers and neuroimaging, and will prepare her to successfully apply for an R01, and become a leader in the field of geriatric neuroHIV."
"9390149","Project Summary We propose to develop and test a novel noninvasive neuromodulation technique integrating transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) with electrophysiological source imaging (ESI) to allow real-time evidence-based neuromodulation with spatio-temporal precision for brain research and managing brain conditions. Despite the recent developments and attention surrounding tFUS, relatively little is known about the mechanisms and optimal parameters of this stimulation technology. The addition of simultaneous functional neuroimaging, aimed at providing biomarkers to assess the effects of tFUS neuromodulation, could provide crucial information regarding the neural response to the applied stimulation in real-time. In order for tFUS to be further developed and transformed into a robust neuromodulation technology, an integrated ESI-guided tFUS system to allow for individualized and responsive stimulation is urgently needed. Our hypothesis is that the integrated dense array EEG and tFUS system will provide important neural data to quantify and optimize stimulation effects in real- time. We further propose to develop a novel acousto-modulated ESI technique to significantly improve the spatial precision allowing for quantifying brain activity induced by tFUS. This proposed integration promises to result in a high spatiotemporal resolution neuromodulation system capable of being applied in a closed-loop and subject-specific manner. To achieve the proposed goal, we will address the following specific aims. Aim 1A. We will develop an ESI-tFUS system and validate the proposed methods in a rat model with simultaneous extracellular recordings of neural spikes and LFP activities. ESI will be performed from the scalp potential distribution and head anatomy to be obtained by structure imaging, and used to assess and optimize tFUS parameters and stimulation strategy. Aim 1B. We will develop an acousto-modulated ESI-tFUS system and validate the proposed methods in a rat model with simultaneous extracellular recordings of neural spikes and LFP activities. tFUS-induced brain activity will be monitored and imaged using the high spatial resolution acousto-modulated ESI, and used to assess and optimize tFUS parameters and stimulation strategy. Aim 2. We will develop an ESI (including acousto-modulated ESI) guided tFUS system for human use with real-time imaging capability. We hypothesize that the ESI-guided tFUS will provide real-time quantitative neural measures to be used to directly adjust tFUS parameters and strategy, allowing for optimization of tFUS stimulation. We will conduct online experiments in motor and somatosensory paradigms to test the merits of the proposed ESI-guided tFUS neuromodulation. The successful completion of the proposed research promises to develop a transformative technique for noninvasive neuromodulation with high spatio-temporal precision, individualized for each subject and responsive to dynamic neural activity recorded from the brain."
"9315953","PROJECT SUMMARY Animals navigate based on self-motion cues and external references, which serve to correct errors accumulated in path integration. Cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) encode direction, speed and position, and their output could represent the neural basis for path integration. The vestibular system provides information for angular and linear motion, and lesion studies have suggested that it may be important for path integration-based navigation. Whether and how this is done represents a mystery. In recent years, virtual- reality (VR) has become fashionable in exploring the navigation circuit. Remarkably, two-dimensional (2D) grid properties are compromised in head-fixed rodents experiencing VR. The hypothesis to be tested here is that this occurs because inertial (vestibular) signals are in conflict with locomotion and visual cues ? which contrasts with real-world navigation where congruent multisensory cues from vestibular, visual and other modalities all converge to give rise to the sense of motion through space. In VR, only the visual and proprioceptive cues are present, while vestibular cues signal no motion. To test the hypothesis that inertial motion cues are necessary for space coding in the MEC, we have built a one-of-a-kind VR apparatus (mouse is head-fixed and locomoting on an air cushioned Styrofoam ball) that is mounted on top of a motion platform, which can provide inertial accelerations. The visual stimulus creating the VR environment as well as the movement of the platform are both controlled by the locomotion of the mouse and the resulting ball rotation. We will monitor grid cell activity during navigation, while rotation and/or translation multisensory cues are independently and systematically manipulated. Our findings could revolutionize our understanding of the nature and properties of the spatial code in MEC by bridging together diverse expertise and two segregated (navigation/MEC/hippocampus and vestibular/multisensory) communities."
"9443388","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cerebral malaria is the deadliest form of malaria, potentially killing half of its victims-primarily children in sub- Saharan Africa. However, most children in malaria-endemic regions appear to develop immunity to severe malaria early in life, a phenomenon that correlates with the production of antibodies to malaria parasite antigens that are expressed on the surface of infected erythrocytes. These variant surface antigens (VSAs) are the most polymorphic families within the parasite genome: Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane proteins (PfEMP1), repetitive interspersed family proteins (RIFINs) and the sub-telomeric variable open reading frame proteins (STEVORs). Each malaria genome has hundreds of genes encoding these diverse parasite surface antigens, of which only a small subset are expressed on the surface of a given infected erythrocyte. If a subset of VSAs is specific to cerebral malaria, they would be an important target for a malaria vaccine to protect children and travelers from the deadliest consequences of malaria. Work at our field site in rural Mali suggests that malaria parasites express a stealth subgroup of these parasite surface antigens more commonly in cerebral malaria than in milder forms of malaria. Our overall goals are to determine the VSA contribution to the pathophysiology of cerebral malaria and the importance of an individual's development of antibodies to VSAs in the acquisition of immunity to cerebral malaria. This project combines novel genomic and proteomic approaches with the use of a new animal model to measure the association between particular variant surface antigens and the development of cerebral malaria and also protective natural immunity. We will determine the genetic sequences of VSAs in cerebral malaria infections and in matched uncomplicated malaria controls in a cerebral malaria case-control study and ascertain which VSAs are found on the surface on infected erythrocytes (Aim 1). Mice will be infected with these field-derived parasites and the microvascular pathophysiological effects will be identified in the brain, including associations with expressed VSAs (Aim 2). Multiple VSA fragments will be encoded onto microarray chips, which will then be exposed to patients' sera to study antibody interactions with all of these proteins at once (Aim 3). This project introduces cutting-edge research techniques-some from outside the malaria research community-including next-generation sequencing, custom microarrays, proteomics, and a promising new animal model, to advance our understanding of cerebral malaria and the development of a cerebral malaria vaccine."
"9387659","PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic wounds affect over 6.5 million patients in the United States alone and result in health costs of more than $25 billion annually. Proper wound healing is the result of a large number of interrelated biological events, which are orchestrated temporally in response to the injury microenvironment. Immediately following injury, a clot is produced which involves the formation of a platelet plug embedded within a fibrin mesh. Platelets bind multiple fibrin fibers and overtime, platelets contract this fibrin mesh through actin driven mechanisms, which contributes to subsequent wound healing by stabilizing the fibrin network, further preventing blood loss, and restoring blood flow past the otherwise obstructive thrombi. Platelet-mediated clot retraction, significantly decreases clot size, alters clot organization, and increases clot stiffness. Increased matrix stiffness has been implicated in activation of important mechanically sensitive pathways involved in wound healing, including Rho GTPase signaling, actin cytoskeleton engagement and mechanical activation of transforming growth factor beta (TGF?), which in turn promote fibroblast migration into the wound bed and extracellular matrix (ECM) production. Importantly, chronic non-healing wounds are characterized by significantly decreased activation of these cellular events. The long-term objective of this proposal is to utilize recently develop platelet-like- particles (PLPs) that mimic this clot retraction feature of native platelets to promote healing in chronic non- healing wounds. PLP-mediated clot retraction occurs via a collective Brownian wrench mechanism to collapse the local fibrin matrix, inducing both global and cell-scale deformations, which ultimately leads to global clot collapse. Particle deformability and high fibrin affinity are critical to achieving PLP-mediated clot retraction. However, the dynamics of PLP-mediated clot retraction are much slower (days) than that of natural platelets (hours). To obtain the benefits of clot retraction in wound repair, it is critical to increase the rate of PLP-mediated clot retraction, to more closely recapitulate the time scale of natural platelets. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to utilize ultrasound (US) stimulation of PLPs to increase the deformation of PLPs within the fibrin network in order to increase the rate of clot retraction in a finely controlled manner. Our central hypothesis is that 1) US stimulation will increase PLP deformations within the fibrin network, thereby increasing interactions with the fibrin network and the rate and degree of PLP-mediated clot retraction; and 2) enhanced clot retraction will increase clot stiffness, promote fibroblast migration into the wound bed through activation of Rho GTPase signaling, increase ECM production, and increase wound closure rates in vitro and in vivo. We will explore this hypothesis in the following aims: 1) Determine the optimal US sequence to maximize PLP deformation and increase kinetics of PLP-mediated clot retraction. 2) Characterize the effect of PLP-US therapy on wound healing outcomes in vitro and in vivo. The significance of our proposed work is the development of a simple and translatable technology enabling the effective treatment of non-healing wounds."

"8114875","The defining feature of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is irreversible airflow limitation measured during forced expiration. This results from a varying combination of increased airflow resistance in the small airways and decreased elastic recoil due to emphysematous destruction of lung tissue. We recently showed that significant obstruction of the small airways is present in the lungs of patients with advanced emphysema and that the inflammatory response in the peripheral lung tissue correlates with the severity of COPD as gauged by the GOLD classification scheme. Quantitative analysis of the inflammatory response found strong correlation with the level of lung infiltration by CD8+ T cells, B cells, and macrophages and suggested that these cell types may specially serve to drive the COPD phenotype. Using CT and 3He magnetic resonance imaging (3He MRI) to quantitatively assess regional differences in small airway obstruction and emphysematous destruction in severe COPD, our imaging group has found that regions of mild to moderate disease are found adjacent to sites of severe destruction or obstructive disease even in patients with GOLD 4-stage disease. We hypothesize that the different levels of lesion severity represent different stages in the pathogenesis of the lesions. Our active lung transplantation program, expertise in new imaging technologies and the ability to conduct quantitative analysis of the inflammatory response and tissue remodeling afford a unique opportunity to construct new criteria for assessment of COPD patients. We propose to investigate the pathogenesis of GOLD 4-stage COPD in patients awaiting lung transplant with the following Specific Aims: 1) To test the hypothesis that there is progression in both extent and severity of the inflammatory immune process in regions affected by moderate to severe degrees of emphysema and small airway disease, using morphologic analysis and quantitative immunopathology to characterize the inflammatory immune process. 2) To noninvasively quantify the regional extent and severity of disease separately in subjects with severe COPD using 3He MRI and high-resolution CT imaging. 3) To validate the in-vivo and ex-vivo imaging results in Aim II against the histology in Aim I in order to develop a new approach to quantifying both the extent and severity of emphysema and small airways disease within the lungs of individual patients with COPD."
"9514517","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Impaired cognitive processing is a hallmark of addiction. Deficits in inhibitory control (impulsive action), poor evaluation of consequences (impulsive choice) and ineffective reversal of compulsive or habitual behaviors (cognitive flexibility) can propel continued drug use despite adverse consequences. A persistent question in alcohol research regards the relative influence of pre-existing cognitive disruptions that confe susceptibility to problem drinking versus the induction of cognitive impairment related to cortical damage induced by repeated alcohol intoxication and withdrawal. In this regard animal models can provide important insight into the etiology of alcohol-induced cognitive impairment and can provide a platform for mechanistic studies and rapid pharmacotherapy screening. Using behavioral paradigms analogous to clinically employed tasks we have gathered preliminary evidence of significant increases in impulsive action and impulsive choice behaviors that emerge in rats during protracted withdrawal from long-term intermittent alcohol consumption. These cognitive impairments persist for several weeks, and can be ameliorated by a pharmacological manipulation known to improve cognitive function in human alcoholics. Based on these findings and knowledge of the neural mechanisms governing these behaviors in rats we hypothesize that withdrawal-associated dysregulation of monoamine and amino acid signaling in frontal cortical regions contributes to increased impulsivity and deficient cognitive flexibility during protracted alcohol withdrawal. This hypothesis will be tested through three Specific Aims. Aim 1 will characterize the emergence, nature and persistence of cognitive disruption during protracted alcohol withdrawal. Different facets of impulsive action will be explored using a novel 5-Choice Continuous Performance Task (5C-CPT) and the Stop Signal Reaction Time task (SSRT). Impulsive choice behavior will be indexed using the Delay Discount Test, and cognitive flexibility will be assessed using an operant spatial reversal learning task. The experiments in Aim 2 will employ in vivo microdialysis and biochemical approaches to characterize monoamine, and amino acid function in the orbitofrontal and medial prefrontal cortices during protracted alcohol withdrawal. Aim 3 will evaluate the efficacy of pharmacologic agents for ameliorating withdrawal-associated increases in impulsive action and impulsive choice."
"8134154","Renal control of sodium excretion is a critical factor in determining long-term regulation of blood pressure.  The Dahl salt sensitive (DS) rat is a well-established animal model of salt-sensitivity that has many of the  characteristics of human hypertension that is common in African Americans. We have observed that DS rats  have an exaggerated blood pressure response to an acute stress and this is exacerbated by a high fat diet.  Studies from Project 1 investigators have shown that African Americans have a shift in the relationship  between arterial pressure and natriuresis during an acute stress protocol such that blood pressure is  inappropriately high relative to the sodium excretion. When given a high salt diet, the DS rat develops  hypertension due to its inability to appropriately excrete a salt load. In recent years, our laboratory has  generated considerable evidence that the renal endothelin B (ETB) receptor plays a critical role in promoting  the excretion of an acute and chronic salt load by activation of nitric oxide synthase 1 (NOS1). Lack of ETB  receptor function leads to endothelial dysfunction and salt sensitive hypertension in various animal models.  To the contrary, treatment with an ETA receptor antagonist will lower blood pressure in salt-dependent  models of hypertension such as the DS rat. We have hypothesized that an imbalance between ETA and  ETB mediated actions contributes to salt-dependent hypertension and associated changes in renal and  vascular function. We further hypothesize that the endothelin and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems  play a role in modulating renal excretory function following stress-induced changes in blood pressure.  Surprisingly little is known about the influence of obesity on the ability of the kidney to excrete salt especially  in the context of environmental stress. The overall hypothesis of the current proposal is that an imbalance of  ETA/ETB receptor function and over activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system contributes to a  reduced ability to excrete salt in the Dahl salt-sensitive rat and that moderate obesity exacerbates this effect.  The following aims will address more specific hypotheses. Specific Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that stressinduced  pressure natriuresis is facilitated by activation of the ETB/NOS1 pathway and that the ETA and  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathways attenuate the response in genetically salt-sensitive rats; Specific  Aim 2: To test the hypothesis moderate obesity attenuates stress-induced pressure natriuresis in genetically  salt-sensitive rats; Specific Aim 3: To test the hypothesis that moderate obesity interferes with the ability of  the ETB/NOS1 pathway to promote sodium excretion by increasing oxidative stress. Relevance: A shift in  the relationship between arterial pressure and sodium excretion is a well-established hallmark of every form  of hypertension. Understanding the mechanisms responsible for pressure-natriuresis in the setting of major  risk factors, such as environmental stress and obesity, will be critically important for developing new  approaches towards the prevention and treatment of hypertension and related disorders."
"9332144","Most HIV-infected patients who stop taking antiretroviral drugs experience rapid viral rebound and suffer in the longer term from higher viral load and lower CD4+ T cell counts. This outcome normally occurs even when individuals have been suppressed for long periods, e.g., several decades. Thus, slow or non-existent viral rebound may occur only under restricted circumstances, including (i) early initiation of antiretroviral therapy, resulting in predominant infection of reservoir cells with shorter half-life, (ii) change in the viral reservoir under ART coverage, e.g., due to myeloablation in preparation for BMT, or (iii) change in the host's capacity for adaptive immune control over virus, e.g., due to therapeutic immunization. The relationships between time of ART initiation, duration of therapy, host immune responses, and kinetics of viral rebound are largely unknown. Given intriguing data indicating that certain host immune responses can contain nascent viral replication and even eliminate virus after low-dose SIV challenge, we propose a program of research on how host T cell responses might impact upon rebounding virus and/or the reservoir from which it springs. Prior studies have characterized rebound as a stochastic process that is most dependent on the number of reservoir cells remaining after ART cessation. We recognize the relevance of this factor but suggest that other reservoir characteristics are important. First, the activity of the viral reservoir, as assessed by cell-associated viral RNA, has recently been demonstrated to be a correlate of more rapid rebound. This finding is interesting because (i) it stimulates one to question if the latent and active reservoirs are separate pools, e.g., due to different viral integration sites, or a single pool of cells that stochastically re-activate transcription and because (ii) cells that are transcribing viral RNA might be vulnerable to host immune control. Second, the anatomic location of the viral reservoir might be important: it appears that RhCMV/SIV can contain viral replication to the portal of entry but have little impact following dissemination; thus, the same vaccines might contain spread of virus from a restricted reservoir. Finally, the phenotype of host cells harboring the reservoir would seem crucially important as their lifespan, anatomic location, vulnerability to antiretroviral drugs, interaction with innate or adaptive immunity, and indeed the kind of released virus will all differ. The objectives of our proposed program are: (i) to understand if host immunity impacts upon rebound via transformative effects on the reservoir itself, especially elimination of the active T cell reservoir; (ii) to understand if host immune responses can impact directly on viral replication or post-interruption setpoint in ways reminiscent of their demonstrated effects in primary SIV infection; and (iii) to test if HLA-E-restricted T cells have a qualitatively unique influence on viral rebound, as compared to effects of classical class Ia-restricted T cells or other host immune responses."

"9340064","Project Summary  The mission of the National Institute on Aging includes elucidation of the causes as well as treatment of all aspects of aging. Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is one of the most common ailments associated with aging. In fact, the number of people with ARHL exceeds that of any other acquired hearing loss. The prevalence of this aging pathology is a compelling indicator of the need to identify the in-depth mechanisms of ARHL and to provide comprehensive strateties with which the communication disability can be alleviated. The prevailing account suggests that the etiology of ARHL is intrinsic to the neural mechanisms of aging. Neuronal degeneration as a persistent feature of ARHL abounds in archival human temporal bone analyses, providing a compelling rationale for targeting spiral ganglion neurons (SGN). The overall aims of the present application are to investigate the very early, initiating mechanisms of sensorineural ARHL and to propose avenues for restoration of auditory function.  The purpose of Core C is to support Projects 1 through 3 in advancing knowledge, at the cellular and molecular neuroscience level in the 8th nerve, its synapses, cells of input in the organ of Corti and cell bodies in Rosenthal?s canal. Core C's mission is to assess age-related ultrastructural changes at the hair cell-SGN synapses, in the SG cell as well as the integrity of the tight junctions in the organ of Corti. Studies of 8th nerve, SGC and HC function conducted in the main Projects are enhanced by high resolution and/or ultrastructural characterizations of the biological specimen. To this end, the Project investigators have access to integrated services of Core C that include a comprehensive range of electron microscopy and imaging techniques. These services include tissue preparation and image acquisition services for structural/ultrastructural analysis as well as ultrastructural localization of proteins in the auditory periphery thus allowing the Project investigators to focus on innovative cellular and molecular analyses of the same tissue.  The Core services allow a centralized source for microscopy and digital imaging services. The availability of complex tissue preparation and subsequent staining by a highly qualified electron microscope technician, collaboration with scientists well-versed in freeze-fracture and electron tomography assures consistent data collection using classical and cutting edge technology. The Core Director assures that the most appropriate experimental designs and data analysis have been utilized. Appropriate review of requests for structural analyses assures that there is a fair and equitable distribution of resources among users."
"9317663","Lysosomal diseases represent a group of nearly 60 monogenic human disorders caused by defects in proteins involved in normal functioning of the lysosomal system. Most severely impact the brain, cause progressive neurological deterioration over years to decades, and are fatal. Pathogenic cascades caused by lysosomal dysfunction are remarkably complex and involve diverse and unusual events ranging from the blockage of autophagy to the growth of bizarre and unique (to lysosomal diseases) ?ectopic? dendrites on cortical pyramidal neurons. To provide a conceptual framework for understanding this complexity we developed in 2009 the concept of a ?Greater Lysosomal System? which put the lysosome at center stage in the cell's recycling process, receiving ?streams? of different metabolites from both endosomal and autophagosomal pathways. We also emphasized ?egress? of catabolic products from lysosomes since lack of such salvage would be anticipated to result in deficient precursors for metabolic pathways and possible up-regulation of synthesis or induction of autophagy to overcome such deficiency. Importantly, recent discoveries give credence to this concept ? most notably that a master regulator of cell metabolism, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR, specifically mTORC1), is anchored at the surface of lysosomes. Here, among a myriad of functions, it controls the translocation of the MITF family of transcription factors (e.g., TFEB, TFE3) which themselves regulate hundreds of genes involved in autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis. Thus much evidence now supports the idea of the lysosome as the cell's ?nutrient sensor?, allowing for orchestration of cell growth programs during periods of high nutrient availability and facilitating autophagy during nutrient starvation. We believe this is the most important window yet discovered through which to investigate the basis for the complexity of pathogenic mechanisms in lysosomal diseases. A central goal of the current proposal is therefore to analyze mTOR function across a carefully selected but diverse group of lysosomal diseases and to do so in concert with our earlier and ongoing studies focused on the heterogeneity of lysosomal storage, the dysregulation of autophagy and p62 aggregation, and the unique growth of new, primary dendrites on cortical pyramidal neurons undergoing lysosomal storage of gangliosides. Thus we propose three highly interlinked specific aims: The first to further characterize lysosomal storage heterogeneity as well as p62 aggregation and its relationship to lysosomes; the second to investigate the impact of lysosomal storage on mTORC1 pathway hypo- and hyperactivation and the consequences of each; and the third to determine the association between altered mTOR activation and changes in dendritic complexity, including so-called ?ectopic dendritogenesis?."
"9279122","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Wound healing is a complex biological process that requires coordination among multiple cell types and the dynamic extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment in four sequential phases: hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling. Although the hemostatic, inflammatory, and to some extent the proliferative phases of wound healing have been well studied, the regulation of the remodeling phase has received less attention. In the remodeling phase, the angiogenic process is complete and anti-angiogenic mechanisms play a key role in removing unnecessary vessels. Vessel regression occurs simultaneously with ECM remodeling, a process that reorganizes and reinforces matrix components to achieve mechanical strength. In most wounds, the end result of wound healing is scar formation, as the ECM never fully returns to normal architecture. Our long term goal is to understand the factors that regulate wound resolution and scar formation. Preliminary studies in our lab demonstrate that pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) is an important endogenous factor that regulates vascular regression in remodeling wounds. Recent studies suggest that PEDF may also have significant interactions with cell types other than endothelial cells (EC), including fibroblasts. Moreover, the effect of PEDF may be influenced by its binding to ECM molecules such as collagen I, collagen III, and heparin. The current proposal will explore the mechanisms by which PEDF influences wound vasculature and scar formation. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that PEDF works through various ECM binding partners to both regulate vessel regression and scar formation during healing. The specific aims of this study are 1) to determine the influence of PEDF on wound angiogenesis and scar formation, 2) to analyze the distribution of PEDF receptors in the wound, and 3) to investigate the specific functional interactions between PEDF and its ECM binding partners in wounds. Aim 1 will involve in vivo studies of wound healing in PEDF-/- mice to determine PEDF's function as an anti-angiogenic and ECM remodeling factor. In Aim 2, immunohistochemical and indirect immunofluorescence studies will localize known PEDF receptors to major cell types that are involved in wound healing. Aim 3 will involve gain-of-function studies utilizing ECM-PEDF complexes. These studies will determine the synergistic effect of ECM bound PEDF on wound healing outcomes, including blood vessel growth and regression, ECM maturation, scar formation, and wound breaking strength. These experiments will provide insight into the mechanisms that regulate the remodeling phase of dermal wound healing, and may suggest future therapeutic options for tissue regeneration, fibrosis and cancer."
"9372480","Project Summary Oxytocin (OT) regulates many aspects of social behavior, including parental nurturing, individual discrimination and social attachment. OT is hypothesized to influence social behaviors by enhancing the salience and reinforcing value of social stimuli. Building on this hypothesis, rodent research has provided a compelling rationale for targeting the OT system to improve social cognition in psychiatric disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Indeed, intranasal administration of OT enhances some aspects of social functioning in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and the OT system is a leading pharmacological target for enhancing social function in ASD. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in noncoding regions of the human OT receptor gene (OXTR) are associated with core symptoms of ASD, altered brain activity patterns, and ASD diagnosis. However, human gene association studies do not provide insights about the exact mechanisms by which polymorphisms in OXTR lead to variation in brain function or social behavior. The socially monogamous prairie vole is an ideal model organism to explore the molecular processes by which variation in the OT system can lead to alterations in brain phenotype, and downstream social behaviors. OT receptor (OXTR) signaling in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) is critically involved in alloparental nurturing and social bond formation in prairie voles. There is remarkable individual variation in the density of OXTR in the NAcc of prairie voles that is associated with variation in social behavior and resilience to early life social neglect. A set of 9 SNPs in the prairie vole OXTR gene (Oxtr) explains more than 70% of the variation in OXTR density in the NAcc, but not in other brain areas. These 9 SNPs are all equally strongly associated with OXTR density in the NAcc, due to fact that they are all perfectly correlated with each other in our colony. In this case, when multiple correlated SNPs are driving the association, genotype-phenotype association study design is not useful to disentangle the individual SNP?s contribution to variation in the phenotype. The goal of this proposal is to develop a state-of-the- art genome editing technique combining viral vector procedures with the novel CRIPSR-Cas9 genome editing method to enable targeting of Oxtr SNPs in the NAcc in adult prairie voles. The viral vector mediated CRISPR- Cas9 method will introduce small mutations hypothesized to alter the function of the genomic region including the targeted SNP and will result in changed NAcc OXTR expression when functional SNPs are investigated. Hence, the functional role of the individual SNPs in the prairie vole Oxtr can be explored using this method. In addition, this approach, for the first time developed in prairie voles, will be useful for future experiments for example identifying the functional roles of specific OXTR neuronal populations in social behavior and will give insights with important implications for human genetic studies investigating the potential influence of OXTR SNPs on brain phenotype, social cognition and psychopathology."
"9321206","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are no methods currently available for the eradication of the latent reservoir in HIV-infected patients. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to develop a new method based on synthetic molecular sensors that is capable of targeting latently infected cells in HIV-infected patients for destruction. The objective of this particular application is to design constructs known as Synthetic Molecular Sensors for HIV Eradication (SMaSHEd) and determine their ability to eradicate latently infected cells from HIV-infected patients or from in vitro latency models. The central hypothesis is that the promoter regions from host genes and the binding sites for miRNAs whose expression can discriminate latently infected from uninfected cells can be used as sensors in SMaSHEd constructs to specifically express a suicide gene in latently infected cells. The rationale for the proposed research is that new methods for eradicating the latent reservoir are required that specifically target latently infected cells, and do not directly target the variable HIV provirus, require activation of HIV replication, or rely on the host immune system to eradicate activated cells. Guided by strong preliminary data, our hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: (1 & 2) Identify genes and miRNAs whose expression can discriminate latently infected primary CD4 T cells from uninfected cells, and (3) Determine the ability of SMaSHEd constructs to induce cell death in latently infected primary CD4 T cells. The analyses in Aim 1 & 2 will utilize RNA-Seq and smallRNA-Seq to identify the genes and miRNAs, respectively that are differentially expressed between latently infected and uninfected primary memory CD4 T cells derived from the in vitro model of our collaborator Dr. Vincente Planelles. Our final aim wil utilize procedures well established in the realm of synthetic biology to design SMaSHEd constructs containing the promoters and miRNA binding sites of genes (Aim 1) and miRNAs (Aim 2), respectively, that specifically sense the environment in latently infected cells. The abilty of these constructs to induce the expression of a suicide gene specifically in latently infected primary CD4 T cells will be assessed following transfection or transduction of mixtures of latently infected and uninfected cells from the in vitro primary CD4 T cell latency model of Dr. Planelles and of Dr. O'Doherty, as well as from HIV-infected patients. The research proposed in this application is innovative, in our opinion, because it will utilize the latest advances in synthetic biology and information gained from next generation sequencing platforms (i.e., RNA-Seq and smallRNA-Seq) to develop a novel method for eradicating latently infected cells. This will be significant because it is the first step in a continuum of research that is expected to lea to the development of a new strategy for the eradication of the latent reservoir in HIV-infected patients. Ultimately, SMaSHEd constructs will be developed for use with appropriate vectors (i.e., adeno-associated virus) for the treatment of HIV-infected patients, where, in contrast to gene therapy, they will only require transient expression to induce the destruction of latently infected cells."
"9393939","Project Summary  Transcriptome turnover is the process by which an organ system or cell type gains and loses the expression of genes over evolutionary time. Comparative data indicate that gains and losses of genes within a tissue-specific transcriptome are widespread phenomena that can have a large impact on tissue function and physiological characteristics of organisms. Genes enter and leave the tissue transcriptome through two classes of genomic changes: structural and regulatory. Structural changes are changes in genome content that occur through processes such as gene duplication and deletion. Regulatory changes are changes in the tissue- specific expression of conserved genes, which occur through the gain or loss of non-coding sequences that control the expression of genes. These regulatory alterations happen through either cis (mutations in non- coding sequences that regulate a gene directly) or trans changes (mutations that alter an upstream regulating protein such as a transcription factor). The mechanism by which genes turnover in the tissue transcriptome may predict their likelihood of cooption into new regulatory circuits in the new tissue and of playing an adaptive role in the new transcriptome.  This research seeks to investigate the relative rates of structural and regulatory turnover and the relative essentiality of genes gained through these mutational processes. Comparative transcriptome profiles, evolutionary models and statistical analysis will be used to estimate the relative frequency of structural versus regulatory turnover in rapidly evolving reproductive organs in 11 species in the D. melanogater species group: the structurally complex testes and structurally simple accessory glands. To compare their essentiality expression of genes that gained expression through regulatory versus structural mechanisms will be knocked down in D. melanogaster accessory glands to directly compare their essentiality to organ function. The impact of transcription factor cooption on the transcriptome and phenotype of the accessory glands will be investigated through transgenic techniques.  The outcome of this research will be an understanding of the frequency and phenotypic impact of genomic mutation types that contribute to transcriptome turnover. This will provide a more detailed understanding of which mutational processes may be the most important sources of new adaptive genetic materials for evolving organs. Characterizing the rate and phenotypic impact of the forces moving genes in and out of organ transcriptomes?whether structural or regulatory; cis or trans?will also allow researchers to use comparative transcriptomics data to home in on the functionally important aspects of the transcriptome when studying human health and disease."

"8114831","Calcium regulation in cardiac myocytes is central to excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) and is also involved in hypertrophic nuclear signaling. Two important and ubiquitous Ca regulatory systems, Ca-calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and inositol (1,4,5)P3 receptors (InsPsR) are present in myocytes, and have been implicated in altering ECC, arrhythmogenesis and nuclear signaling. However, surprisingly little is known about how these effects occur. Ca-dependent pathways implicated in regulating transcription in hypertrophy (Hyp) and heart failure (HF) include CaMKII, which may function via activation of nuclear export of type II histone deacetylases (HDAC) which otherwise repress transcription. Overall goals here are to understand better how CaMKII functions in cardiac myocytes with respect to acute Ca signaling (ECC & arrhythmogenesis) and how both InsPsR and CaMKII may be involved in nuclear signaling (via HDAC) in hypertrophy & HF. Main experimental methods include confocal fluorescence imaging (of Ca indicators & other fluorescent probes) and voltage clamp in isolated adult cardiac myocytes. Myocytes  will be isolated from mice (including CaMKIIS or lnsPaR2 knockout (KO) mice and mice subjected to aortic banding, Hyp) and rabbits (including our well characterized non-ischemic arrhythmogenic HF model). This project focuses on cellular aspects of CaMKII in 3 aims. Aim 1 will address acute CaMKII effects on ECC, with respect to 4 properties (Ca current facilitation, altered SR Ca release (during diastole and ECC), frequency-dependent acceleration of relaxation & recovery of SR transport during sustained acidosis). These will be assessed in CaMKIIS-KO mice and those in which a CaMKII inhibitory peptide is targeted specifically to the SR. Aim 2 will test a novel hypothesis about Ca-dependent nuclear signaling via a proposed local InsPsR-CaM-CaMKIIHDAC pathway that may respond preferentially to neurohumoral stimuli (e.g. endothelin-1) rather than the Ca transients associated with ECC. Local measurements of [Ca] and translocation of HDAC-GFP and fluorescent CaM will be used, along with pharmacological and molecular dissection (e.g. CaMKIISc- and lnsP3R2-KO mice). Aim 3 will assess altered CaMKII signaling in Hyp & HF regarding ECC, arrhythmias & HDAC activation. The expression and function of CaM, CaMKII & InsPsR in the alteration of  ECC, arrhythmogenesis and nuclear/ hypertrophic signaling via the above HDAC pathway will be assessed in both HF rabbits (from Core B) and Hyp mice from Project by Brown. The novel dual GFP FRET sensors for [InsPs] and CaMKII activity will also be incorporated into these studies as they are developed in Projects by Mignery and Brown. The proposed work will be integrated closely with the other three projects and will provide comprehensive new information regarding the roles of CaMKII and InsPaR in cardiac myocytes during ECC, arrhythmogenesis and nuclear signaling in normal, Hyp and HF cardiac myocytes."

"9391432","Project Summary Alopecia areata (AA) is a common autoimmune form of hair loss that affects approximately 5.3 million people in the US, including males and females across all ethnic groups. Autoimmune diseases collectively carry a tremendous public health burden, imparting a severe economic and social impact globally. The prevalence of this class of disorders is currently estimated to be 7.6-9.8%, and results in annual direct health care costs of at least $100 billion in the U.S, as estimated by the NIH. AA typically presents as loss of distinct patches of hair that can hair loss can spread to the entire scalp or the entire body. We recently conducted regulatory modeling of alopecia areata from gene expression analyses. Reverse-engineered regulatory networks have recently demonstrated great promise in the analysis of other complex diseases, such as cancer and Alzheimer?s disease, and have been used for drug prediction. The DeMAND algorithm was designed to leverage high-throughput drug screens conducted at Columbia University, where panels of FDA-approved drugs were used to treat several cancer cell lines. We utilized the DeMAND algorithm interrogated with our regulatory networks from alopecia areata patient samples, and identified a repurposable drug candidate, Vorinostat, an HDAC inhibitor, which we will evaluate for pre-clinical efficacy in alopecia areata in this proposal. There is a strong use-case for Vorinostat in alopecia areata, particularly because this predicted repurposing crosses indications.

"9280997","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal fibrotic lung disorder with no effective medical treatment. The biological processes that underlie fibrotic lung repair and their molecular drivers have yet to be fully elucidated. Myofibroblasts are critica to the in vivo fibrogenic tissue repair process. Although both a mechanical signal (internally-generated cell tension, matrix stiffness), and a TGFß-initiated signal are essential for optimal mature myofibroblast differentiation, the actual molecular pathway by which the mechanical signal is transduced/maintained, or its downstream consequences on in vivo fibrosis, are not known. We have made the novel observation that an ion channel in the transient receptor potential vanilloid family (TRPV4) serves as a mechanosensor/transducer to promote myofibroblast differentiation. This mechanosensitive, calcium permeable channel is rapidly activated upon local plasma membrane stretching. The hypothesis that TRPV4 mediates myofibroblast differentiation and pulmonary fibrogenesis by potentiating the TGFß signal in a matrix stiffness, and PI3K-dependent manner, will be tested in three specific aims. The work in Aim 1 will determine the mechanism whereby the TRPV4 channel function is increased in response to TGFß. The work in Aim 2 will determine how the PI3K intracellular signaling pathway affects TRPV4 function to mediate myofibroblast differentiation. Through this work, the underlying mechanism for the observed upregulation of TRPV4 activity in lung fibroblasts from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients will be defined. The work in Aim 3 will determine the role of TRPV4 in pulmonary fibrogenesis in vivo, in two distinct murine models of pulmonary fibrosis. When completed, this work will provide conclusive evidence for the mechanism of TRPV4 channel's effect on myofibroblast differentiation, its intracellular signaling pathway, and the rol of TRPV4 in experimental pulmonary fibrosis."
"9308690","PROJECT SUMMARY Rural Area Food Training and Safety (RAFTS) Summary: The Franklin Regional Council of Governments (FRCOG) and the Franklin County Cooperative Public Health Service (CPHS) propose RAFTS as a 5-year project to develop and implement a strategic plan that will address the systemic problems associated with food safety in rural jurisdictions in Franklin County as well as most of Western Massachusetts. The FRCOG/CPHS is applying for FDA funding to enable a rural regional health department to take steps to better protect its population by achieving greater conformance with the Retail Program Standards. Massachusetts is the seventh smallest state in the nation, but has the highest number of local health departments ? 351. This leads to great fragmentation and a lower standard of public health protections than in much of the rest of the nation. The participating towns, which have all enrolled in the Program Standards, propose to build a system for improved workforce training of food handlers and food inspectors, standardization and increased enforcement uniformity, and improved industry communication and relations. The lack of FDA standardized inspectors across the region results in inconsistency in inspections, imprecise code application, and non-uniform compliance efforts. There is currently not any publicly accessible information about food inspection results or compliance status for retail food establishments in rural jurisdictions. An outcome of this project will be a regional system that tracks permit status, inspection results, and compliance history which is capable of producing reports that can then be shared with industry and the public. Increasing the public's access to food safety information will be a significant improvement and should lead to greater consumer confidence in the food safety program, and should help to prioritize funding for this essential public health service. The VNRFRPS will be used as the framework for the creation of the RAFTS program. The improvements in rural regional retail food safety will be a great step forward for public health in Massachusetts, and will provide a model for cross-jurisdictional sharing on food safety."
"9307802","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is powering the field of Genomics and increasingly permeating all aspects of biosciences research and clinical practice. This development has triggered a huge need for data analysis skills among researchers and professionals. As biosciences graduate programs and also biomedical professional schools are rapidly adapting their curricula towards a greater emphasis on quantitative analysis skills, it has become apparent that the current pool of graduate and medical/pharmacy school applicants who have an understanding and hands-on experience in quantitative analysis of `omic datasets remains exceedingly shallow. Indeed, without prior computational biosciences research experience it is difficult to evaluate applicants for their aptitude in quantitative analysis skills. In this post-genome era of biosciences research, a lack o aptitude in quantitative analysis skills will hamper graduate students and biomedical researchers through their careers. The proposed research education plan is addressing this need by providing potential applicants of graduate and professional schools with a Summer Program focused on NGS data analysis and statistics, culminating in a capstone research project in the area of computational genomics to apply these skills and document proficiency. The proposed summer undergraduate summer course in hands-on computational genomics leverages existing infrastructure at UCLA's QCB Collaboratory and adapts and extends these to train both the likely applicants of graduate and biomedical professional schools, as well as the next generation of Big Data educator-scientists by training postdoctoral fellows in workshop teaching, and by disseminating the tools and infrastructure to other institutions."
"9302604","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Alcohol Center for Translational Genetics (ACTG) will identify novel proteins as targets for therapeutics for alcohol use disorders and will determine mechanisms by which they act to regulate excessive ethanol intake. Candidate proteins will be evaluated in ethanol self-administration procedures that model excessive binge drinking in humans, motivation to drink ethanol, and relapse. The anatomical focus will be on 3 brain regions, the nucleus accumbens, the amygdala, and the ventral tegmental area, which all play important roles in ethanol consumption and relapse. Based on findings during the current funding cycle that identified H-Ras/PI3 kinaseAKT/mTORC1 signaling as a key regulator of ethanol consumption, all Research Components will include experiments that test the relationship of the novel proteins with this pathway. Three research projects will focus on proteins new to alcohol research: SGK1, GSK-3 and others whose translation is regulated by mTORC1 (Component 4); PKM? and its direct substrates (Component 5); and orexin/hypocretin receptors (Component 6). An Administrative Core (Component 1) will manage ACTG functions. An Animal Behavior Core (Component 2) will perform studies of intermittent ethanol access in rats and mice and will provide assistance in rat operant self-administration procedures. A Vector and Imaging Core (Component 3) will provide state-of-the art services to generate viral vectors for transgenic expression or gene silencing, and to analyze transcript and protein abundance by laser capture microdissection, high resolution immunofluorescence, and quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization for detecting mRNAs in dendrites. Two Pilot projects are planned. The first will test the hypothesis that delta opioid receptor mediated inhibition of GABA release decreases alcohol consumption in anxious alcoholics. The second will determine whether up-regulation of NMDA receptor activity, induced by excessive ethanol consumption, facilitates long-term potentiation in the dorsomedial striatum, and thereby enhances ethanol drinking and seeking. Collectively, the ACTG provides a unique opportunity for integrated study of novel proteins that may lead to the development of new treatments for alcohol use disorders in humans."
"9363356","Project Summary/Abstract Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are the most common congenital malformations. 5% of CHDs comprise atrioventricular septal defects (AVSDs). However, the molecular etiology underlying most AVSDs are not understood. Furthermore, CHDs can cause cardiovascular diseases later in life, resulting in arrhythmias, stroke, and premature death. In order to develop novel therapies able to prevent CHDs and heal specific cardiovascular tissues, it is critical to garner understanding of fundamental mechanisms directing normal cardiac chamber development and regeneration. Therefore, long-term goals of our lab are to understand conserved mechanisms that direct the development of the individual cardiac chambers and chamber-specific mechanisms of regeneration in vertebrates. Few signals are known to be required that specifically direct atrial development, with specific regulators of atrial regeneration not being understood. The specific aims of this proposal are to elucidate the mechanisms by which a syntenic long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) as-oca restricts atrial development and regeneration through inhibition of Nr2f1a translation in zebrafish. The studies in this proposal are relevant to human health as recent genomic analysis indicates that mutations in the orphan nuclear receptor Nr2f2 are associated with AVSDs in humans. While Nr2f2 knockout mice and in vitro studies with human stem cells have revealed requirements for both Nr2f1 and Nr2f2 in atrial development, the mechanisms by which Nr2f proteins direct proper atrial development are not completely understood. Importantly, there is currently no understanding of epigenetic lncRNA-dependent mechanisms regulating Nr2f proteins. Our preliminary analysis of the novel zebrafish mutant acorn worm (aco) indicate that excess expression of as-oca specifically restricts the addition of later differentiating second heart field (SHF)-derived atrial cells. In Aim 1, we will use blastula cell transplantation, in vivo cardiomyocyte differentiation assays, and genome editing to determine the cellular requirements underlying the atrial defects and cause of increased as- oca expression in aco mutants. We do not understand how as-oca inhibits Nr2f1a translation in aco mutants. In Aim 2, we will use RNA and ribosomal association techniques and loss of function methods to determine if as- oca inhibits Nr2f1a translation through interactions with the nr2f1a 3' untranslated region. In addition to their requirements during development, we find that as-oca and nr2f1a are specifically expressed in the atria of adult zebrafish. In Aim 3, we will test the effects of as-oca on embryonic and adult models of cardiac regeneration. Because Nr2f transcription factors play conserved roles in atrial development of all vertebrates, these studies will dramatically improve our understanding of posttranscriptional mechanisms regulating normal vertebrate atrial development and the molecular etiology of AVSDs and ASDs in humans. Ultimately, these studies will generate a foundation for improved therapies capable of preventing CHDs in children and efficiently repairing injured hearts in adults."
"9320004","Project Summary In the past decade, little improvement has been made in the survival of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients. Although mechanisms underlying GBM remain poorly understood, it is known that the interaction of tumor cells with inflammatory tumor microenvironment promotes cancer progression. Further, extensive inflammation is a key hallmark of GBM. NF-kB proteins are most known for their role in immune and inflammatory responses, however they also control cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Not surprisingly, aberrant NF-kB activity has also been implicated in oncogenesis. Recently a novel ?RelB-canonical? pathway of NF-kB signaling that involves RelB/p50 dimers has been found to be active in dendritic cells. Intriguingly, our preliminary data indicate that a proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1? (IL-1), may support GBM progression through this RelB- canonical pathway by inducing expression of a set of RelB-dependent genes. We also discovered that IL-1 induces RelB phosphorylation; however, it remains to be determined whether this phosphorylation facilitates RelB-canonical signaling, thus driving GBM progression. We hypothesize that inflammation-induced phosphorylation of RelB promotes RelB-canonical signaling and activates a gene expression program that supports GBM progression. To test this we propose the following aims: Aim 1: Establish the role of RelB phosphorylation in its activation by IL-1 Aim 2: Evaluate the role of RelB phosphorylation in GBM Aim 3: Determine the role of RelB in GBM development and progression in vivo Completion of these aims will establish whether RelB phosphorylation promotes RelB-canonical signaling to support GBM progression. These studies could pave the way for more specific and effective GBM therapies."
"9389644","7. PROJECT SUMMARY Background. Electro- and magneto-encephalographic (EEG/MEG) responses to a stimulus are systematically attenuated? by up to 80%? if the same stimulus was presented less than 8-12 seconds ago. This dynamic modulation of response amplitude to identical stimuli is one of the most striking and fundamental properties of the EEG/MEG signal. The proposed work will test the hypotheses (1) that the attenuation of EEG/MEG amplitude to repeated identical stimuli is caused by short-term synaptic depression at cortical synapses and (2) that the manifestation of synaptic depression at the micro- and meso-scopic level critically depends on local circuit and network architecture leading to a complex but systematic relationship between macroscopic modulation of EEG/MEG responses and several micro- and mesoscopic measures of neural function."
"9382020","Abstract Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an emerging mosquito-transmitted alphavirus that causes an abrupt onset of fever with severe joint and muscle pain. In a significant number of patients chronic and debilitating arthritis can persists for months to years. CHIKV pathogenesis reflects an interplay between events controlling viral replication and the host inflammatory immune response. Key mediators of the host response to viral infection are type I interferons (IFNs), which collectively is comprised of 13 IFN-alpha (?) proteins and single IFN-beta (?), kappa (?), epsilon (?), and omega (?) proteins. The type I IFN response is known to control CHIKV infection, as mice lacking the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) die soon after infection. However, the role of individual IFN subtypes is poorly understood. In preliminary data, we have found that IFN-?-/- and IRF7-/- (a surrogate for IFN-?) are more susceptible to CHIKV induced disease, whereas IFN-?-/- mice are resistant, providing evidence for functional differences between the IFN subtypes in vivo. In this proposal, we will define the mechanistic basis for how different type I IFN subtypes modulate CHIKV pathogenesis by exploring their ability to control viral replication and spread, function as immunomodulatory proteins, or temper the host response. In Aim 1 we will define the role that IFN-? plays during acute and chronic CHIKV infection by exploring its ability to limit viral replication and dissemination and determining whether IFN-? regulates the cell tropism of viral persistence. In Aim 2 we will determine the function of IFN-? during acute and chronic disease and evaluate its impact on modulating the cellular and adaptive immune response during acute and chronic infection. In Aim 3 we will investigate the novel actions of IFN-? by evaluating its impact on CHIKV pathogenesis in vivo and defining functional differences in signaling through IFNAR between IFN-?, IFN-?, and IFN-?. Overall, our studies will provide new insight into the effects of type I IFN immunity on CHIKV induced disease, which may promote the development of novel therapeutic strategies."

"9305081","Summary  Approximately 101,000 people are waitlisted for a kidney transplant in the United States, while only about 17,000 kidney transplants took place in 2013. This shortage of transplantable kidneys can be overcome by differentiating kidneys from patient derived induced pluripotent-stem cells to improve survival rates of end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Since kidneys develop from the ureteric bud (UB) and metanephric mesenchyme (MM), we need to make the different cell types that differentiate from the UB and MM to engineer kidneys in culture. Our goal is to understand the molecular mechanisms regulating kidney collecting duct differentiation into principal cells (PCs) and intercalated cells (ICs). This knowledge will be used to establish methods to convert UB cells into PCs and ICs in culture. We hypothesize that PC promoting signals (Signal-P) co-operate with Notch to activate Elf5 expression and other PC lineage transcription factors (PCFs) to promote PC differentiation (Fig.1). Ectopic expression of activated Notch1 turns on Hes1 and Elf5 among other candidate PCFs to induce precocious PC differentiation in developing CDs in vivo, but is unable to turn on Elf5 or other PC specific genes in cultured immature UB cells. Notch signaling suppresses Foxi1 (an essential IC factor), other candidate IC transcription factors (ICFs), and components of candidate signaling pathways (Signal-I) that promote IC differentiation. In Aim1 the early regulators of collecting duct differentiation that turn on Elf5, an early PC marker, and Foxi1, an early intercalated cell (IC) marker, will be determined. Aim2 focuses on determining intermediate regulators of PC and IC differentiation by examining the contribution of Foxi1, Elf5 and Hes1 to collecting duct differentiation using genetically modified mice, UB cells, and mature PC and IC lines. In Aim3 we will determine how mature PCs are maintained. We have evidence implicating Notch signaling in maintenance of mature PC cell state. This will be verified by conditional inactivation of Notch signaling in adult CDs and the mechanisms of Notch mediated PC maintenance will be determined. A mouse model of acquired Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus (aNDI) in which mature PCs are reduced, potentially due to cell fate switching, will be used to determine which CD differentiation factors are involved in PC maintenance. By lineage tracing we will definitively determine whether PC to IC fate change occurs during aNDI. These studies are not merely incremental but provide a transformative step in our understanding of collecting duct development and maintenance."

"9308940","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary etiologies of Chronic Kidney Disease are a direct result of initial glomerular dysfunction. Podocytes are epithelial cells in the glomerulus that help maintain the renal filtration barrier. In many glomerular diseases, the podocyte loses specific markers of differentiation, characteristic morphologic features, and the functional capacity to maintain the glomerular filtration barrier. We recently characterized the role of Kr?ppel-Like Factor 15 (KLF15), a kidney-enriched ubiquitous transcription factor, in podocyte differentiation. Specifically, we showed that a global loss of KLF15 increased the susceptibility to kidney injury in murine models of podocyte injury. Furthermore, we confirmed that the local kidney expression of KLF15 is reduced in human glomerular diseases such as FSGS and HIVAN. Finally, we also established that KLF15 is required for recovery from podocyte injury.  Retinoic Acid (RA) has previously been shown to attenuate the loss of podocyte differentiation markers and thereby reduce proteinuria and ameliorate kidney disease. We have shown that RA-induced podocyte differentiation is mediated by KLF15. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are the first line of immunosuppressive therapy in the treatment of many glomerular diseases. Similar to Retinoic Acid, GCs have also been shown to protect podocytes from injury. Others have identified GC response elements in the promoter region of KLF15. We observed that dexamethasone increased KLF15 expression in human podocytes and in primary murine podocytes in culture. In addition, a loss of KLF15 in primary podocytes in culture attenuated the increase in GC-induced podocyte differentiation. Combined, we hypothesize that KLF15, a key transcriptional regulator of podocyte differentiation, mediates the renal protective effects of RA and GCs in glomerular disease. To address the hypothesis, we propose to first determine that KLF15 is necessary for podocyte differentiation using podocyte specific knockout mice and inducible, podocyte-specific KLF15 overexpression murine model. Second, we plan to ascertain the role of KLF15 in mediating renal protective effects of RA and GCs in glomerular disease. Finally, we propose to identify the upstream factors regulating KLF15 and downstream factors regulated by KLF15 in podocyte differentiation.  Impact of proposed research outcome: We plan to determine whether the up-regulation of KLF15 mediates the renal protective effect of glucocorticoids and retinoic acid in glomerular disease. This will provide new insight into the podocyte biology and pathology, as well as a potential new target for therapy. Candidate's short-term and long-term goals: My short-term goal is to meet the specific aims of this research project while I continue to expand my knowledge on podocyte biology and disease by attending formal weekly divisional research conferences and monthly Work in Progress meetings. I will also attend the annual American Society of Nephrology national meeting and the biennial Podocyte meeting and FASEB KLF meeting, where I will be exposed to the latest research in the field of glomerular disease and KLF biology. I will continue to take opportunities such as these to share my data so that I can benefit in my professional development from the criticism of my colleagues in our field.  Justification of the need for further training: My current research project involves the role of KLF15 in podocyte differentiation. With the K08 Award, I will be expected to expand my knowledge in molecular biology, biochemistry, and regulatory networks by attending graduate level courses at Stony Brook University School of Medicine. In addition, further mentoring from the multidisciplinary advisory committee during the next five years will be crucial in providing a strong foundation towards research independence. I am prepared to spend 75% of my professional effort towards reaching the goals outlined in my research strategy and training plan.  My Long-term goal is to be an expert in KLF15 in kidney disease, specifically to gain a strong foundation in utilizing an integrative approach of molecular techniques and systems biology to identify potential therapeutic targets in glomerular disease. I can achieve this by completing the outlined training goals and the specific aims of my research strategy. In addition, as I meet my research goals, I will work on publishing my work in peer-reviewed journals and apply for foundation grants with original ideas that may stem from my current work. After four years of support from the career-development grant, I plan to begin my career as an independent investigator by applying for R01 level funding.

"9396621","Abstract Stress can trigger pathological changes in behavior and appears to augment substance abuse vulnerability. Nonetheless, only a portion of individuals who experience similar stress events develop any appreciable pathology, thus individuals may express either a susceptible or resilient phenotype following stress. Recent evidence suggests that susceptibility and resilience following stress are associated with distinct adaptations to the mesolimbic dopamine system, which is well known to participate in the development of substance use disorder. Whether increased substance use vulnerability selectively corresponds with the unique behaviors and physiology associated with susceptibility and resilience remains unknown. For our preliminary studies we exposed rats to predator scent stress, and segregated subjects as susceptible or resilient based on the context avoidance and heightened anxiety behavior in the elevated plus maze. Using this approach, we found that susceptibles but not resilients, display an increased propensity to self-administer cocaine. Further, we have identified that distinct dopamine system changes are associated with the susceptible phenotype. In combination with our preliminary studies, the proposed studies are designed to first determine the net effect of terminal and somatodendritic DA system alterations using in vivo measurements of DA activity, and second to isolate the sources of net changes in DA signaling by examining DA terminals or DA neuron soma independently."
"9262301","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Essential tremor (ET) is regarded as the most common movement disorder with an estimated prevalence of around 4% after the age of 40 years. Diagnosis of ET is ascertained on the basis of defined clinical criteria however there are concerns among movement disorder specialists that ET is over diagnosed in the community. ET is frequently confused with other neurological disorders associated with tremors for example Parkinson's disease. Since the FDA approved dopamine transporter SPECT (the DAT scan) imaging, differentiation of ET from Parkinson's disease has become easier and reliable. The other major differential diagnosis of ET is tremors associated with dystonia (dystonic tremor). Differentiation of ET from dystonic tremor based on the existing clinical methods is a major challenge. Although imaging methods may allow a better differentiation of ET and dystonic tremor, these methods cannot develop without a complete understanding on the pathophysiology of these two disorders. The pathophysiology of ET and dystonic tremor is broadly considered to have relation to abnormal brain networks. ET is primarily related to abnormal functioning of the cerebellum-motor cortex network and dystonic tremor traditionally is related to abnormal basal ganglia-motor cortex network. However recent studies suggest the cerebellum-motor cortex network may be important even in dystonic tremor. The primary goal of this K23 study is to characterize and compare these brain networks related to ET and dystonic tremor and advance our pathophysiological understanding. We will examine ET and dystonic tremor with a task based functional MRI protocol and diffusion weighted imaging. We will use a reliable grip force task to identify the amplitude of blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) activity and connectivity in these networks. We will use diffusion tractography to examine the connectivity patterns in these networks. Our central hypothesis is that the BOLD activity and the functional and structural connectivity in basal ganglia- motor cortex and cerebellum-motor cortex networks will reveal distinct patterns of abnormalities in ET and dystonic tremor. These critical insights into pathophysiological brain networks that underlie ET and dystonic tremor will be used to develop imaging based markers for differentiation of tremors in the clinical settings The candidate's long-term goal is to develop an independent and successful research program focused on the characterization of movement disorders physiology which can lay guidelines for better diagnosis and improve treatment opportunities for these disorders. To achieve this goal, the candidate has organized a training program involving advanced coursework in functional and structural imaging techniques, tremor physiology methods, biostatistics and clinical research methods. The primary mentor, Dr. David Vaillancourt is a well- established NIH funded researcher in functional and structural imaging techniques. He is an experienced mentor with a reputation for fostering the development of many young trainees into independent, NIH funded, investigators. In this application, he has assembled a team of renowned clinicians, biostatistician and experts in essential tremor, dystonia and imaging to serve as co-mentors and members on the advisory committee. University of Florida provides numerous training activities and resources, including regular seminars, lectures and journal clubs on clinical research, physiological techniques and relevant data analysis techniques. In summary, the candidate has chosen the right setting and environment to conduct a mentor guided research with advanced imaging techniques important for differentiation of ET and dystonic tremor and improved therapeutics in future."

In addition to preparing scholars to address the significant human and economic  challenges associated with assisting this increasingly diverse and vulnerable population to  achieve their health goals, this renewal will:  capitalize on the strong foundation in science  contributed by program faculty members, build upon an established collaboration between  faculty members in two of Penn Nursing's research centers (the New Courtland Center for  Transitions and Health and the Center for Integrative Science in Aging), employ innovative  inter-professional mentorship and training models that engage preeminent scholars throughout  Penn, offer trainees unparalleled opportunities to learn sophisticated and emerging research  methods, and place a new emphasis in preparing future scholars who can rigorously translate  science to have an impact on clinical practice and health policy. During this five year renewal, four pre-doctoral students and four postdoctoral research fellows will be appointed annually. The goals of the proposed training program align with each of NINR's strategic priorities as well as  the Department of Health and Human Services' strategic goal of optimizing the health and  quality of life for individuals with multiple chronic conditions"
"9329482","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The recent discovery that de novo zygotic mutations in the form of CNVs and point mutations make major contributions to neuropsychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia and autism begs the question as to the degree to which de novo post-zygotic mosaic mutations also contribute to disease. In this model, a mutation that occurs post-zygotically can seed some percentage of cells in the brain, and is sufficient to lead to neuronal dysfunction and disease. The approach of sequencing only non-neural tissues such as blood may underpower the detection of mosaicism, because mutations may be restricted to neural tissue. This proposal brings together a highly productive and collaborative team, in which each member contributes a special resource to make this effort truly unique. Gleeson and Mathern recently identified among the first de novo somatic mutations in the developing brain in the condition known as `hemimegalencephaly' (HME), a catastrophic neuropsychiatric condition associated with focal cortical disorganization (FCD). By comparing DNA from diseased brain vs. blood, we identified de novo somatic mutations in PIK3CA, AKT3 and MTOR, part of the mTOR pathway, in as few as 8% of brain cells, resulting in perturbations in an entire cerebral hemisphere. Courchesne and Roy recently identified focal patches of abnormal laminar cytoarchitecture in frontal and temporal cortex in the majority of available brain samples of children studied with autism (ASD), and we suggest focal patches akin to FCD may have similar mutations and contribute to disease. The goal of this application is to extend the discovery of mosaicism in patients with epilepsy and autism in which neurohistopathological evidence points to FCD, by sequencing dysplasias compared with adjacent normal tissue and/or blood at the DNA and RNA level at the single-cell level. We aim to uncover key sets of genes, in which specific de novo mutations, in specific locations, at specific mosaicism levels, is sufficient to produce clinically defined disease. We will combine next-generation sequencing of FCD brain from patients with neuropsychiatric disease with advanced bioinformatics, single-cell sequencing, complete clinical correlated neuroanatomy and mouse modeling. We will: 1] Test for de novo somatic mutations in a retrospective and prospective cohort of FCD presenting with autism or epilepsy. 2] Correlate genetic disease burden with clinical, imaging, histopathological and single-cell sequencing findings. 3] Test mechanisms by which uncovered de novo mutations alter progenitor cell functions in mammalian cerebral cortex."
"9461232","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mammalian skin and its appendages function as the outermost barrier of the body to protect inner organs from environmental hazards and keep essential fluids within the body. Understanding molecular mechanisms that operate in skin development is an important prerequisite for future applications in regenerative medicine and for developing therapeutic treatment for human disease. Many regulatory mechanisms including cell signaling, cytoskeleton remodeling, transcriptional and epigenetic controls and post-transcriptional regulation have been implicated to have important roles in skin development. Among these mechanisms, microRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation exerts a widespread control over the output of the transcriptome. These noncoding RNA molecules broadly modulate a large number (~60% in mammals) of genes and play important roles in a wide range of biological processes. In mammalian skin, the critical functions of the miRNA pathway in embryonic and neonatal skin development have been well appreciated. However, individual microRNA functions and the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In particular, microRNAs that play important roles in hair follicle morphogenesis are unknown despite extensive interests. To address this important issue, we propose to focus on the miR-200 family, a highly expressed microRNA family in the hair placode. Importantly, the loss of the miR-200 microRNAs in the skin leads to defective hair germ formation, consistent with their important functions in the skin. We will examine their roles in primary keratinocytes in vitro and in the hair placode in vivo (Aim 1 and 2). To provide mechanistic insights for their functions, we will apply biochemical purification of microRNAs and their associated mRNA targets to the WT and miR-200 knockout mice and identify miR-200-associated targets in a hair placode-specific manner. We will focus on comprehensively identifying important targets of miR-200 in regulation of cell proliferation, adhesion and migration as well as important signaling pathways in the skin. The long-term goal of this project is to elucidate individual microRNA functions and provide mechanistic insights to these molecules during skin development with a particular focus on hair morphogenesis. The knowledge gained from these studies will pave the way to manipulate microRNAs in neonatal skin progenitor cells for regenerative medicine and enhance our understanding for microRNAs' roles in skin cancer."
"9287155","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT High volume drinking and related adverse consequences pose significant health concerns at US colleges and universities; drinking behavior often leads to students being sanctioned for violations of campus alcohol policy. Given the widespread use of mandated alcohol interventions for these students, optimizing their initial effects and their duration could substantially mitigate adverse alcohol outcomes. Self-affirmation represents a promising adjunct to brief alcohol interventions, particularly those delivered via computer that are popular but tend to have smaller effects. Basic research shows that when self-affirmation exercises precede the receipt of health information, they decrease defensiveness and resistance to threatening health information and increase acceptance and processing of health messages. Furthermore, the facilitative effects of self-affirmation are strongest among those at higher risk. Because many mandated students display both defensiveness and high drinking severity, use of self-affirmation to enhance information processing and reduce defensive responding could optimize the efficacy of an active alcohol intervention in this at-risk subpopulation. We propose to use a two-group randomized design to investigate the effect of a self-affirmation exercise prior to an empirically supported brief alcohol intervention consisting of computer-delivered personalized normative feedback (PNF). Building on an extensive history of academic-student affairs collaborations, we will recruit 450 mandated students from a large public university over the course of 5 semesters. Our primary aim is to examine the additive effects of an initial self-affirmation (SA) manipulation prior to receiving PNF (SA + PNF) relative to Control + PNF on alcohol use and consequences. This study extends prior work by evaluating the ability of self-affirmation exercises to supplement active alcohol interventions (rather than just health messages), and tracking the impact on alcohol use over a longer (12-month) follow-up period. Secondary aims include (a) testing theoretically-derived mediation sequences that explain the SA + PNF effects on alcohol use and alcohol consequences, incorporating mechanisms of action associated with both self-affirmation and brief alcohol interventions, and (b) the examination of theoretical moderators of the effects of SA + PNF on alcohol use and alcohol consequences. We will use latent growth curve modeling analyses to examine direct and indirect intervention effects on alcohol use and consequence trajectories from (pre-intervention) baseline assessment across 1-, 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month follow-ups. The public health goal of this research is to reduce the acute and chronic effects of alcohol misuse by improving the efficacy of a low intensity brief alcohol intervention. The findings of this study have both practical and theoretical implications. Demonstration of the additive utility of a very brief self-affirmation exercise could improve the efficacy and impact of currently available computer- delivered interventions for mandated students; it may also expand the reach of self-affirmation theory, leading to adaptation of self-affirmation for use with other at-risk populations receiving brief alcohol interventions."
"9488580","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the major challenges of HIV-1 vaccine development is the elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against HIV Env. The recent isolation of several bNAbs from HIV-infected individuals demonstrates that the human B cell repertoire can generate bNAbs targeting the conserved Env region. However, there is still a tremendous knowledge gap regarding how the broad responses are elicited during chronic HIV-1 infection and, additionally, how these compare to the much more limited responses elicited by Env vaccination. To fill this information gap, we propose to define and improve the elicitation of neutralizing antibodies toward the most functionally conserved and accessible element of the HIV-1 Env complex, namely the CD4 binding site (CD4bs), which is crucial for virus engagement with receptor CD4. Previously, we developed a multicolor Env epitope-specific B cell sorting and RT-PCR strategy to exploit the memory B cell compartment of HIV-infected individuals, which led to the isolation of CD4bs bNAb, VRC01, which neutralizes >90% of circulating primary viruses. Interestingly we find that VRC01 and CD4i antibody subsets can mutually enhance binding affinity for gp120, suggesting that CD4i MAbs may be associated with the evolution of VRC01-like bNAbs during the natural infection process. We adapted this epitope-specific memory B cell sorting strategy to extend our study to gain insight of Env B cell response, which is summarized as follows. (1) To characterize the neutralizing antibody response elicited by vaccination of Env-inoculated non-human primates (NHPs). We will perform memory B cell FACS sorting, clonal analysis and IgG gene deep sequencing of Env-specific B cells. (2) To determine the longitudinally evolving neutralizing antibody response in selected HIV-infected individuals. We will investigate factors associated with bNAb response from a few highly selected HIV-1-infected individuals by analyzing their CD4bs bNAbs and their complementary antibodies including CD4i antibodies. (3) To advance immunogen design by examining if i) Env-CD4i MAb complex as immunogen can improve the elicitation of CD4bs bNAbs; ii) long-lasting Env antigen exposure via AAV vector platform can improve the B cell affinity maturation. We will test these hypotheses in small animals. The overall outcome of this study will contribute to our basic understanding of HIV neutralizing antibody responses and the development of a safe and protective HIV vaccine."
"9261295","Project Summary Our inability to culture hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), or study physiologic and pathologic hematopoiesis in vitro, remain as significant problems in hematopoietic biology. Recent studies focus on reprogramming pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) or somatic cells to hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). These studies, however, rely on gene delivery systems that integrate into the host genome. This widens the gap between the bench and the bedside by impeding the application of these in vitro generated blood products for transplants and drug testing platforms. A method to generate HSPCs de novo without genomic disruption, and use of these studies for disease modeling, are critical for understanding the mechanisms behind the pathologic hematopoiesis encountered in multiple hematopoietic disorders such as Fanconi Anemia (FA). In this disorder, the associated bone marrow failure (BMF) is preceded by a significant reduction in CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors in utero. Using a minimal set of transcription factors (TFs) we have shown our ability to induce a hemogenic program in mouse fibroblasts that generate HSC-like cells over time that are phenotypically and functionally similar to HSCs. Promising results after translating these methods to human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) can provide a novel model system of FA and other hematologic disorders in vitro for drug testing and gene editing platforms with the goal of therapeutic discovery and eventual patient-specific HSC transplants. The aims of this F31 application proposal are to 1) investigate non-integrative methods to induce a hemogenic program in human fibroblasts and 2) utilize hemogenic reprogramming to study the pathologic hematopoiesis that precedes BMF in the FA disease state. The ability to generate zero footprint hematopoietic cells de novo (and therefore without the risk of insertional mutagenesis and oncogenesis) is highly clinically relevant, as are any discoveries made regarding defective hematopoiesis in FA after application of this novel reprogramming strategy. To achieve these goals, I will first generate polycistronic cassettes carrying our TF cocktail for hemogenic induction that will then be transferred to a self-replicating RNA (srRNA) system that robustly expresses these factors without genomic disruption. HDFs will then be reprogrammed with these constructs to ensure efficient hemogenic induction. I will also induce hemogenesis in patient-specific FA HDFs to determine the impact of the FA pathway defect in emerging hematopoiesis. I will rigorously analyze global gene expression profiles (RNAseq) and TF binding for candidate pathways (ChIP-PCR) in our reprogrammed cells to identify potential mechanisms behind the FA pathway in definitive hematopoiesis. The strengths of this proposal lie in the innovative reprogramming strategy that recapitulates definitive hematopoiesis in a dish, and the potential findings after applying this technology to hematologic disease models. This project is designed to frame the research in a clinical context and provide specialized training of a future physician scientist."
"9347326","PROJECT SUMMARY: We previously demonstrated in mice that the major pathogenic features (eosinophilic airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness [AHR]) were markedly enhanced in mice exposed to repeated social stress and these changes were associated with impaired glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression and function. In studies on non-human primates (rhesus macaques) at the California National Primate Research Center (CNPRC) at UC Davis, anxious temperament (an early manifestation of psychosocial stress) in young monkeys was significantly associated with AHR and glucocorticoid non-responsiveness of immune cells. We propose to investigate secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG), a novel antiinflammatory molecule, and natural non-toxic bioactive component of flaxseed, as an alternative/adjunct therapy for glucocorticoid resistant asthma. SDG has proven reducing, chelating and free radical scavenging activities in vitro and in vivo and it induces activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) a major anti-oxidant transcription regulator and inhibitor of NF-kB. Our aim 1 is to evaluate the effects of the synthetic version of SDG (LGM2605) on airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), inflammatory markers of blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) immune cells and glucocorticoid function of peripheral blood mononuclear cells of socially stressed rhesus macaques. Aim 2 is to assess LGM2605 treatment on genetic and epigenetic regulation of the GR, NF-kB and NRF2 using bronchial brush biopsies. The strength and novelty of our proposal is the unique Rhesus macaque model system of asthma associated with psychosocial stress and glucocorticoid resistance, and the synthetic availability of LGM2605 through LignaMed. Upon completion, these studies will lay the groundwork for subsequent Phase II trial and ultimately to human clinical projects."
"9378686","Project Summary A variety of nucleic acid ligands have been implicated in the striking Type I Interferon (IFN-I) response observed in lupus and related diseases but which ligands and receptors drive disease are unclear. Amongst putative ligands are retroelements (RE), one class of which, the SINES, was recently shown to bind to the autoantigen, Ro60. Tying this observation to the surprising finding that Ro60 deficient mice get lupus, we will test an explanation for lupus pathogenesis that links disease susceptibility to Ro function. To test the hypothesis that an excess of SINES relative to Ro induces IFN-I and a lupus like disease, we propose:  In Aim 1, we will identify the small non coding RNAs that bind to murine Ro60 and we will define the Ro recognition motifs (RRM) using a highly sensitive and specific immunoprecipitation technique called iCLIP. In addition, we will generate mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFS) that are deficient in Ro and in one of the key RNA sensors called RIG-I or MDA5 that stimulate IFN-I signaling. These experiments will identify the RNA ligand, motif(s) and corresponding RNA sensors responsible for cell autonomous IFN-I stimulation.  In the second Aim, we will ask how Ro60 and RNA binding elements are regulated, in response to lupus relevant environmental triggers. First, using cell based approaches and the MEFS generated in Aim 1, we will de-repress SINES by inhibiting the methylase that is responsible for suppression of SINE transcription in mice. Next, we will expose cells to UVB radiation that has been shown to result in increased SINE expression. Finally, as prompted by our preliminary data, we will examine whether Estrogen (E2) upregulates SINES or reduces Ro expression. The experiments are expected to validate SINES as the key RNA ligand that provokes cell intrinsic IFN-I stimulation and test whether lupus related environmental factors alter expression of the RNA or protein. Following these experiments, we will examine the same environmental factors in Ro deficient mice. Since Ro deficient mice develop a lupus like autoimmunity for which there is no current explanation, we will explore the hypothesis that, when Ro is limiting or SINES are overexpressed, SINES stimulate IFN-I which in turn leads to a lupus like disease in the appropriate genetic background. We expect that UV light will increase IFN-I expression in the skin and that this finding will be markedly exacerbated in Ro deficient female mice.  Anti-Ro antibodies are usually the first autoantibody to develop in human lupus ? many years before the onset of clinical disease. They are also associated with congenital heart block and UV mediated skin rashes. Through understanding the roles of SINE elements and Ro in triggering specific IFN pathways in lupus, we should be able to explore the pathobiology with much greater insight in human SLE and devise approaches to targeted prevention and treatment."
"9330934","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an acquired neurological disorder that can cause long- lasting disability with limited treatment options. Therefore, preventative strategies must be emphasized in high-risk activities to reduce the individual and societal burden of this pervasive injury. Bicycle activities account for 20% of all sports-related TBI, with over 50,000 annual injuries in the US. In an effort to alleviate the incidence and severity of these head injuries, helmet usage is now recommended, and in some states mandatory. However, contemporary bicycle helmets are not designed to mitigate rotational head acceleration, which is a clear physical mechanism of TBI. A novel helmet using High Impact Velocity Engineering (HIVE) technology has been developed that combines a proprietary cellular liner with an innovative suspension technique to provide superior energy absorption in a lightweight and cost-effective design. This advanced impact management system absorbs torsional and normal impact loads, and thus enables HIVE helmets to provide an unprecedented level of protection from linear and rotational head accelerations. STTR Phases I and II delivered conclusive evidence on the feasibility and performance of HIVE technology. HIVE prototype helmets yielded a 71% reduction in rotational head acceleration, corresponding to a 44% reduction in predicted TBI risk compared to standard bicycle helmets. This application seeks support for late stage development and technical assistance required to commercialize HIVE bicycle helmets. Timely commercialization of HIVE helmets is an urgent matter to decrease the incidence and severity of TBI among the over 50 million people in the US that regularly ride a bicycle."

"9318445","Project Summary/Abstract: Next Generation Immunoanalysis Core Research on immune reactions in human skin and human inflammatory diseases has been hampered by the relative paucity of reagents, such as tetramers, that are available for human-based research. However, there has been a revolution in the last five years in the tools available for human immune profiling. These techniques have opened the door to comprehensive study of immune reactions in human skin and blood. The purpose of this Core is to make two critical groundbreaking techniques, cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) and next- generation high throughput T cell receptor sequencing (HTS), available to skin disease researchers at any institution with the goal of accelerating translational research in human inflammatory skin diseases. CyTOF combines immunostaining with mass spectroscopy and allows measurement of up to 45 different markers in single sample, with no signal overlap and no need for compensation. CyTOF instruments are located in a small number of major academic medical centers. We provide access to the Longwood Medical Area CyTOF facility and also provide services that will make CyTOF accessible, including staining protocols, validated panels of CyTOF antibodies, custom conjugated CyTOF antibodies, advice on experimental design and data analysis, and all services needed for outside investigators to send their cells to the Center for analysis. HTS is a powerful technique that allows one step comprehensive profiling of T cells in tissues and the ability to identify and track pathogenic T cell clones across various tissues, including blood and skin. We provide comprehensive support in experimental design, DNA preparation protocols, DNA sample preparation services, shipping, and data analysis assistance that will enable human skin disease researchers to rapidly use this technique to profile immune skin immune responses. We also offer custom staining for pathogenic T cell clones using a combination of HTS analyses and immunostaining of tissue sections with commercially available TCR V? antibodies. These combined techniques allow selective identification and study of particular T cell clones. The research community potentially includes any individual wishing to carry out human skin disease research; we have included 24 projects from investigators who wish to utilize Center services. 18 users would like to utilize the Immunoanalysis Core for their projects. 11 are from outside institutions, six have never worked in human skin disease before and six have worked primarily in mouse models previously, with little or no prior work in humans. Eight of these projects are described in detail in this component and other projects are described fully in the two other Resource Core portions of the application. In summary, the Next Generation Immunoanalysis Core will make CyTOF and HTS, two cutting edge analytic techniques, available to researchers at any institution who wish to carry out human tissue based skin disease research."
"9321920","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The brain evolved complex recurrent networks to enable flexible behavior in a dynamic and uncertain world, but its computational strategies and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We propose to uncover the network basis of neural computations in foraging, an ethologically relevant behavioral task that involves sensory integration, spatial navigation, memory, and complex decision-making. We will use large-scale electrical recordings from six relevant interconnected areas (visual cortical area V4, Area 7A, Entorhinal Cortex, Hippocampus, Parahippocampal gyrus, and Prefrontal Cortex) of freely behaving macaques. To track the neural network computations used in these ethologically relevant, natural tasks, we will exploit recent advances in both statistical data analysis and theories of neural computation. First, to characterize behavior, we will model relationships between task-relevant sensory, motor, and internal variables using graphical modeling. Animal behavior will be modeled in the framework of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) and these models will provide predictions about which variables the animals use and how they interact. Second, once we have modeled the behaviorally relevant variables, we will use modern data analysis techniques to identify these variables from the patterns of neuronal responses, extracting the low- dimensional, task-relevant signals from the high-dimensional population activity. The time series of these low- dimensional neural representations will be used to analyze the transformation and flow of signals between different brain areas, using such measures as Directed Information. Finally, we will compare these neural analyses to predictions from the normative models of the foraging task. We hypothesize that neural representations of sensory and internal variables will exhibit the same causal and temporal relationships manifested in the behavioral model. By combining - for the first time - normative modeling, selective dimensionality reduction of neural population signals, and quantification of directed information flow, we will be able to identify the transformations within and between key brain areas that enact neural computations on complex natural tasks. The team project aims to produce a transformative view of distributed neural population coding, unifying ethologically crucial computations across multiple neural systems."

"8114886","The protease-antiprotease hypothesis of emphysema pathogenesis has support from many human  and animal studies. A longstanding tenet of this hypothesis has been that proteases relevant to  emphysema pathogenesis must be capable of degrading elastin. However, data in recent years  indicates that collagenolytic activity may induce emphysema. Membrane-type 1 matrix  metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), a cell-surface MMP that cleaves fibrillar collagens, and EMMPRIN, an  inducer of MT1-MMP, are detectable in emphysematous lung tissue, suggesting a role for MT1-MMP in  emphysema pathogenesis. Moreover, monocyte migration in vitro requires MT1-MMP so that MT1-  MMP is likely to be involved in the accumulation of macrophages in the lungs from smoking as well as  in destruction of alveolar walls. The studies we propose will determine the roles of MT1-MMP and  EMMPRIN in the pathogenesis of emphysema. We will determine whether levels of MT1-MMP and  EMMPRIN expression by monocytes, at baseline and upon stimulation, have a relationship to  monocyte migration among smokers with and without emphysema, and whether levels of MT1-MMP  and EMMPRIN expression by alveolar macrophages correlate with emphysema as determined by chest  computed tomography (CT). To accomplish these objectives we will assess the role of MT1-MMP on  the migration of smokers' monocytes with MT1-MMP blocking antibodies, and we will measure MT1-  MMP and EMMPRIN mRNAs by quantitative PCR on alveolar macrophages harvested by  bronchoalveolar lavage and laser capture microdissection. These studies will be complemented by  analyses of the pulmonary responses to tobacco smoke in mice with targeted deletions (knockouts) of  the genes for MT1-MMP or EMMPRIN, and in mice with deletion of the gene for TIMP-2, the principal  inhibitor of MT1-MMP. Taken together, the proposed studies will contribute new understanding of  mechanisms of pulmonary inflammation and emphysema that occur in response to tobacco smoke."
"9328534","Project Summary/Abstract Chronic pain and itch (pruritis) drastically impact every aspect of daily function, often hindering work performance and severely impairing quality of life. Current treatments aimed at alleviating these conditions have serious side effects and lack sufficient efficacy for long-term use. Characterizing the molecular mechanisms by which noxious stimuli are processed may reveal candidate molecules to target with novel pharmacological treatments. Pain- and itch-sensing neurons whose cell bodies lie in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) detect algogenic (pain-causing) and pruritogenic (itch-causing) stimuli in peripheral tissues and transmit the signal to the spinal cord, then to the brain. Signaling mediators released after injury or in the context of skin disorders both activate DRG neurons, leading to the perception of pain and itch, and sensitize these neurons, causing enhanced responses upon further stimulation. The signaling molecules that contribute to this sensitization activate receptors that yield diacylglycerol (DAG) production in the DRG. DAG can be converted into monoacylglycerol (MAG). DAG and MAG affect activity of DRG neurons by directly modulating receptor activity, activating secondary messengers that alter signaling, and acting as precursors to downstream metabolites that affect pain and itch. I have discovered that diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) can phosphorylate MAG in addition to phosphorylating DAG. Altering levels of DAG, MAG, or their metabolites has been shown to cause differences in pain signaling. Therefore, I am interested in determining if DGK?s phosphorylation of DAG and MAG can alter lipid levels in peripheral sensory neurons and lead to changes in itch and pain. I am investigating the DGK isoform iota (DGK?) that I found to be highly expressed in the pain- and itch-sensing DRG neurons of mice and humans. I hypothesize that DGK? kinase activity regulates levels of signaling lipids in DRG neurons, mediating somatosensory signaling. Using a DGK? knockout mouse, I have confirmed that kinase activity on both DAG and MAG is reduced in DRG neurons. Preliminary experiments with these mice show that sensitivity to pruritogens is enhanced by the loss of DGK?. To determine how alterations in lipid levels contributes to somatosensory phenotypes, I will use mass spectrometry to compare levels of DAG, MAG, and related signaling lipids in neuronal tissue between wild type and DGK?-/- mice. I will further examine sensitivity to itch in vivo using acute exposure to pruritogens. Additionally, I will examine pain sensitivity to noxious mechanical and thermal stimuli in DGK? knockout mice. Mice will be sensitized via inflammatory and neuropathic injury, and the severity of sensitization and recovery will be measured. Furthermore, I will investigate calcium responses to algogenic and pruritogenic stimuli that activate receptors regulated by these lipid signaling molecules in the DRG. In vitro signaling experiments and in vivo behavioral assays coupled with lipidomic analyses will help me characterize the role of DGK? in somatosensation and discover the potential of this kinase as targets for pain and itch therapies."
"9306088","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Renal osteodystrophy (ROD) represents the bone histologic abnormalities resulting from loss of renal function. It starts early during the loss of kidney function and is seen in virtually all chronic end stage kidney disease patients on dialysis (CKD-5D). A major component of ROD is bone loss leading to CKD-associated osteoporosis. Debilitating hip fractures occur in patients with CKD at a rate 4.4 times higher than in the general population, with associated high costs, morbidity and an annual mortality of 64%. CKD osteoporosis is distinctly different from post-menopausal osteoporosis. Presently, no uniformly accepted CKD osteoporosis treatment protocol exists because of challenges related to racially specific bone turnover states. Therefore, most physicians are reluctant to treat this disorder despite the profound impact on health and quality of life, and its association with vascular calcifications. These vascular calcifications confer an increased risk for cardiovascular events which are the major cause of the over 20% annual mortality rate in CKD-5D patients. The goal of the proposed controlled randomized study is to test the concept that CKD osteoporosis can be successfully treated when treatment is individualized by patients' turnover status. The study will demonstrate that reversal of bone loss can be achieved by increasing bone formation in low turnover patients, and by reducing bone resorption in normal or high turnover patients. A second aim of this study is to provide new information whether these treatments will also retard progression of vascular calcifications. Blood tests measuring FGF23, indicators of Wnt pathway activity, bone resorption and formation will be followed to understand potential mechanisms and to evaluate their usefulness for prediction of changes in bone mass and vascular calcifications. CKD-5D patients with established osteoporosis will be enrolled into one of two treatment arms based on bone turnover status. Each arm will be adaptively randomized by race, age and gender into treatment or control groups. In the low turnover arm, teriparatide combined with cinacalcet will be given, and in the normal or high turnover arm, alendronate will be administered. Bone mineral density will be measured at baseline and after one year of treatment by quantitative computed tomography. Calcifications of the coronaries, aorta and heart valves will also be measured at the same times by multi-detector computed tomography. If this proof-of-concept study is successful, it will offer a heretofore unavailable treatment for osteoporosis i CKD-5D patients thus changing the prevailing clinical practice paradigm. This will provide immediate benefit to CKD patients by reducing fracture risk, bone pain, and cardiovascular risk, while greatly improving their quality of life. These improvements will also convey major socioeconomic benefits by decreasing the high associated treatment costs. The proposed study is highly relevant to the NIDDK's mission of disseminating science-based information to improve the health and quality of life for patients with endocrine, metabolic and kidney diseases."
"9393069","Project Summary/Abstract Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death in the US with cardiovascular (CV) disease representing a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Exposure to air pollution represents a common risk factor for COPD and CV disease. People in the US spend the majority of their time indoors and our research group has shown that high indoor particulate matter (PM) concentrations are linked to worse COPD morbidity. Evidence suggests that platelet activation, long implicated in CV disease, may play a role in the pathophysiologic consequences of PM exposure. PM exposure has been associated with elevated markers of platelet activation in mice, healthy subjects and those with CV disease. Elevated markers of platelet activation have also been reported in patients with stable and exacerbated COPD. However, whether PM exposure is associated with increased platelet activation in patients with COPD, a population particularly at-risk for high air pollution exposures, and whether platelet activation plays a role in COPD morbidity remains unknown. We hypothesize that exposure to elevated indoor PM concentrations is associated with increased platelet activation and that platelet activation is associated with respiratory and CV morbidity among patients with COPD. To study the potential role of activated platelets in response to PM exposure and in COPD morbidity, we propose adding repeated measurement of markers of platelet activation in 100 former smokers with moderate-severe COPD enrolled in a study (CLEAN Air) to investigate the effect of an indoor air purifier intervention on COPD morbidity that includes intermediate CV outcomes as part of a sub- study (CLEAN Air Heart). This proposal has two novel aims. First, to determine the association between indoor PM concentrations and platelet activation among individuals with COPD, we will add measurement of three markers of platelet activation (11-dehydro-thromboxane B2, soluble P-selectin, and soluble CD40 ligand) at each of three visits (baseline, 3 and 6 months) while capitalizing on the quantification of environmental exposures and clinical phenotyping performed as part of the parent study. Second, to determine the association of platelet activation with respiratory morbidity and intermediate CV outcomes in patients with COPD, we will examine the association of the measured markers of platelet activation with respiratory outcomes such as lung function, symptoms, six-minute walk distance, and quality of life, and intermediate CV outcomes such as endothelial dysfunction, vascular stiffness and elevated pulmonary artery pressure. We will exploit the extensive characterization of participants' comorbidities in the parent studies while expanding CV phenotyping by newly measuring pulmonary artery diameter (to evaluate right heart strain) and coronary artery calcium (to quantify coronary artery disease). If we find that platelet activation is associated with PM exposure or COPD morbidity, future investigation of antiplatelet therapy as a potential therapeutic target in patients with COPD would be warranted."

"9308711","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of regenerative medicine technologies holds great potential to drive progress in the prevention and treatment of individuals with a host of acute and chronic pathologies resulting from injury, disease or aging. As we approach this new era of technological advancements, rehabilitation specialists must work closely with regenerative medicine scientists in the development of clinical protocols to optimize functional recovery. While there are many important and superb congresses on the topic of stem cell biology and regenerative medicine, these meetings are rarely attended by those in the rehabilitation field. Similarly, few regenerative biologists are exposed to protocols and methodologies commonly employed in the clinic by rehabilitation professionals, protocols which serve as potent stimuli to drive functional tissue restoration. Nor are most regenerative biologists exposed to the diverse fields of rehabilitation science. There is, therefore, a great need for an established forum in which individuals from the fields of rehabilitative and regenerative medicine may interact such that, as technologies are developed and as understanding of regenerative biology progresses, advances may be smoothly and efficiently translated to the clinic. This R13 proposal seeks funds to help offset conference expenses in order to support the participation of students and young investigators in the Annual Symposium on Regenerative Rehabilitation. This series has enjoyed tremendous growth since its inauguration in 2011 and now comprises academic partnerships from across the country. With this in mind, the meeting rotates locations annually as a means to broaden exposure to and participation by a national audience.  The specific aims of this symposium series are: 1. to promote the clinical translation of regenerative and rehabilitation medicine scientific discoveries by communicating and disseminating research findings that demonstrate the synergistic relationship between regenerative medicine and rehabilitation; 2. to provide a forum at which scientists and rehabilitation clinicians may interact, exchange ideas, and identify novel research directions relating to the field of regenerative rehabilitation; and 3. to introduce the concept of regenerative rehabilitation to graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, medical students and medical residents in the rehabilitation field. To achieve these aims, Course Directors and Advisory Board members work to carefully design a highly multidisciplinary and translational 2-day program that includes thematically linked presentations highlighting the importance of mechanical stimulation for tissue regeneration and functional restoration. The support derived from this R13 application will help us keep registration costs affordable in order to attract a larger number of clinical and scientific students, fellows and junior investigators to this unique forum designed to highlight the emerging field of regenerative rehabilitation."
"9348585","Overall PROJECT SUMMARY One of the abiding philosophies of the Johns Hopkins Division of Rheumatology is that the critical pathway to understanding human autoimmune rheumatic diseases is through the study of large numbers of well-defined patients, followed over time, with the collection of rich phenotypic data, mapping disease trajectory, and where possible, acquiring and storing relevant biological materials from blood and target tissue. This repository of data and samples can then be used to separate heterogeneous diagnostic groups into more homogeneous subgroups, using tools that span the entire spectrum of investigation. This P30 will focus on providing the framework for organizational (oversight, management), operational (recruitment, sampling, processing), measurement and analytical (statistical, computational, and integrative) expertise to enable effective clinical and translational research. The Hopkins RDRCC competitive renewal comprises an Administrative Core (Core A) led by Drs. Rosen and Bingham, and includes 3 scientific Cores: (i) Core B is the Research Management and Patient Integrated Data (RAPID) Core, led by Dr. Bingham; (ii) Core C is the Sample Processing and Immunoassay Research (SPIRE) Core, led by Drs. Casciola-Rosen and Soloski; and Core D is the Data Science Core, led by Dr. Scott Zeger. The Center is structured as a matrix, designed to foster collaborative and synergistic discovery by maximizing access of the diverse research community to data and samples from humans with rheumatic diseases. Core A will promote efficient, interdisciplinary research throughout the research community and Cores, and manage the enrichment program. Core B will facilitate studies on humans with rheumatic diseases, by providing research management and oversight functions, enhancing research integration with the Epic EHR, and enable patient-centered outcome research. Core C will provide assistance with patient sample acquisition, processing, storage and distribution, as well as provision of multiple immunological assays for discovery and validation of biomarkers and disease pathways. Core D will provide highly innovative tools to enable analysis of complex longitudinal data in rheumatic disease patients, particularly with the design and application of Bayesian hierarchical models to identify disease subsets.  "

"9325535","Metabolic syndrome is increasingly prevalent, is usually associated with obesity and glucose dysregulation,  and leads to increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Risks of obesity and diabetes type 2 begin in eariy  childhood, including in utero programming, and environmental factors likely play a role in these risks. The  effect of exposure to ambient air pollution (AAP) on risk of obesity and diabetes among children has been  well studied. Our primary hypothesis is that oxidative stress induced by exposure to AAP leads to systemic  inflammation which in turn leads to increased risk of obesity and diabetes. A secondary mechanistic  hypothesis is that AAP-induced Treg dysfunction increases risks of obesity and diabetes. To test these  hypotheses, analyses of children in the different stages of development represented in a piecewise, natural  history design will be conducted (ages 0-2, 7-9, 16-19, and 19-22). Detailed historical information,  anthropometric data, and blood samples will be collected for all subjects. Exposures to AAP will be estimated  from in utero onward. The proposed study has the following aims: a) to determine whether chronic exposure  to AAP, especially polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), is associated with increased HbAlc, BMI, and  8-isoprostane (biomarker of oxidative stress), CRP (biomarker of systemic inflammation), leptin, adiponectin,  and high-density lipoprotein (biomarkers of abnormal fat and glucose metabolism); b) to determine whether  AAP-induced dysfunction of T regulatory (Treg) and T effector cells is associated with increased HbAlc and  BMI; and c) to determine whether epigenetic modification of Foxp3 underiies the associations between Treg  dysfunction and HbAlc or BMI. Using an experienced field center staff, 220 children in each ofthe two  younger age groups and 100 subjects in each of the older groups will be recruited from Fresno and followed  for variable durations depending on age. Working with the Exposure Core to generate lifetime pollutant  exposure histories and the Biostatistics-Epidemiology Core to build marginal structural models, the multidisciplinary  research team will conduct analyses of the associations between chronic exposures to air  pollutants (or Treg functional parameters) and HbAlc, BMI, or the biomarkers of interest."
"9339723","Project Summary This program will have a major impact in the field of cell-based therapy for the leading cause of death and disability in patients with type 2 diabetes (DM), namely cardiovascular disease (CVD). Endothelial dysfunction underlies the high rates of CVD associated with long-term DM. We will conduct a phase I/II, randomized double-blind study testing the efficacy and safety of allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) vs. placebo in patients with type 2 DM, endothelial dysfunction and ischemic heart disease. This trial is built on a solid foundation of 6 phase I/II trials conducted by our group that evaluated the safety and efficacy of autologous and allogeneic MSCs in patients with ischemic and non-ischemic CVD. MSCs improve endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) function and systemic endothelial function (measured by brachial artery flow-mediated dilation, FMD%) in patients with ischemic as well as non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, including non-DM and DM patients, suggesting that we now have a means to target a primary cause of the CV manifestations of DM. Moreover, the effect on EPCs and FMD% was sustained (3 months after MSC administration) and evident in patients receiving allogeneic, but not autologous, MSCs. Accordingly, this phase I/II study is timely, warranted, and could have a major health impact by addressing an unmet need in a large population of patients at risk for myocardial infarction, heart failure, sudden cardiac death, and recurrent hospitalizations. This study will break new ground in the field in several respects. It will establish the efficacy of allogeneic MSC intravenous (IV) delivery on systemic endothelial function (assessed by EPC function and FMD%) as well as coronary artery endothelialization and vessel healing post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Although safety has already been established by previous phase I/II trials of intravenous MSC delivery, additional safety data will be determined from this DM population with ischemic heart disease. The proposed study will accomplish 3 aims: 1) Test the hypothesis that IV delivery of allogeneic MSCs stimulates EPC function and circulating angiogenic growth factors and improves FMD% in type 2 DM patients; 2) Test the hypothesis that IV delivery of MSCs improves 3 month post-PCI endothelialization and vessel healing in DM patients (assessed using optical coherence tomography); 3) Test the hypothesis that allogeneic MSCs promote endothelial repair through rescue of bone marrow progenitors in DM patients with ischemic heart disease. Bone marrow biopsies will be obtained from DM patients at 3 months after MSC or placebo infusion for a detailed molecular and functional assessment of the effect of IV allogeneic MSCs on bone marrow autologous MSC and EPCs. Together, the studies proposed in this application will advance our understanding of this promising cellular-based therapy and address a major unmet need in DM patients with CVD. This clinical trial program is highly significant as cellular therapy offers the potential to restore endothelial function in this population at high risk for CVD morbidity and mortality."
"9328142","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adenotonsillectomy (AT) is one of the most common surgical procedures performed in children, with more than 500,000 operations performed annually in the US. A large proportion of these are performed in children with primary snoring, or mild sleep-disordered breathing (MSDB) rather than in children with frank obstructive sleep apnea. Although AT has been shown to improve behavior and quality of life in school-aged children with sleep apnea, the role of this common surgery in children with MSDB is not known, resulting in large practice and geographic variation in its use. Considering the morbidity and health care costs of AT, it is crucial to determine the impact of the surgery on outcomes of value to patients and the healthcare system. We propose to take advantage of a successful collaboration of leaders in sleep medicine, otolaryngology, neuropsychology and clinical trials to conduct a randomized clinical trial of AT for MSDB. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that children with MSDB benefit from AT as defined by improved behaviour and attention (primary outcomes) and decreased health care utilization. Using a single-blinded, randomized design, we aim to recruit 460 children (50% minority), aged 3-9 years, with polysomnographically-confirmed MSDB from 5 leading pediatric centers. Participants will be randomized to early AT or watchful waiting with supportive care, and undergo standardized evaluations of sleep, behavior, attention, quality of life, and health care utilization at baseline and 12 months. Body habitus, urinary cotinine levels, actigraphy, family functioning, atopy and socioeconomic status will be assessed to identify potential moderating influences. This rigorous design and comprehensive study will resolve existing uncertainties on initial management approaches for pediatric MSDB by addressing several critical issues: a) assess outcomes of importance to children and their families, particularly the patient- reported outcomes of behavior, quality of life, and sleep disturbances); b) examine differences in treatment responses among children who are at increased risk for MSDB, such as pre-school children, minorities, and children with asthma or obesity; c) evaluate health care utilization as a unique and timely outcome; d) assess moderating influences of second hand smoke, insufficient sleep, socioeconomic status and family functioning. Study results will provide evidence on whether children with MSDB benefit from surgery and will identify subgroups who are most likely to benefit, thus informing future management approaches of this common pediatric condition and helping to direct resources to those children most likely to benefit."
"9388169","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Pulsatile tinnitus (PT) is the perception of rhythmic sound without an external source. It is a debilitating symptom experienced by more than 5 million Americans. PT has very high rates of comorbid debilitating psychiatric illness that can typically be mitigated by treating the underlying cause of PT. Unfortunately, not all causes of PT are treatable and in many cases the current treatment methods may be more hazardous to patients' health than the underlying disease. The etiology of pulsatile tinnitus is known to be related to blood flow, however, to date, the specific features of hemodynamics that result in symptoms has not been established. This project plans to expand on new insights into features of the velocity field in the venous sinuses that our team has obtained using advanced MR velocity measurement method that indicate a link between patterns of blood flow and symptom presentation. These results indicate a consistent finding in patients with PT, namely regions of pronounced vorticity. In individuals with normal caliber vessels the vortex manifests in cases when the jugular bulb is high relative to the sigmoid sinus insertion. In individuals with irregular venous caliber, such as diverticulums and stenoses, regions of vortex swirling in and adjacent to these irregularities are noted. In this project we will conduct a systematic study that will first develop improved MR methods for measuring the velocity field. These will be based on validation in carefully characterized flow models. Undersampling methods (with advanced reconstruction) that substantially reduce acquisition time will be implemented. The most favorable methods will then be used to image flow patterns in two classes of subjects: Normals and those with PT who have regular caliber vessels across the spectrum of geometric variability in the venous sinuses; and patients who have irregular flow lumens (diverticulums and/or stenoses.) We believe that successful conduct of this study will set the stage for a more comprehensive investigation of PT that would include the use of Computational Fluid Dynamics to interrogate features that cannot be easily manipulated in vivo, and that can be used to simulate the sound generation associated with hemodynamic features. We also consider that there would be a role for inclusion of the measurement of turbulent kinetic energy (under investigation in our laboratory) in this condition. We believe that this project will provide a basis for providing new insights into the physiology underlying sound generation from the venous sinuses. This information will provide guidance to interventionalists who wish to develop novel and safer treatment methods, including design of new devices, to treat adverse conditions in the cerebral vascular structures near the hearing apparatus thought to be the underlying cause of PT."
"9294098","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Historically, 75% of drugs have insufficient labeling to inform physicians on pediatric dosing, safety, or efficacy. Mechanisms requiring the study of new products in children are relatively new and highlight a training gap in pediatricians related t the investigation of therapeutic agents: There is an urgent need for well-trained pediatric investigators with quantitative research skills in pharmacology, epidemiology, and biostatistics. In this competitive renewal, the investigator, Daniel K. Benjamin, Jr., MD, PhD, MPH, will continue to prepare pediatricians for a career in patient-oriented research to help bridge this gap in accordance with his own long-term research goals: to improve pediatric drug development by establishing proper dosing, safety, and efficacy of drugs used in adolescents, children, toddlers, infants, and neonates.  Dr. Benjamin successfully achieved the aims outlined in the original award by developing a research program in pediatric clinical pharmacology and therapeutics. The centerpiece of the program is the NICHD- sponsored Pediatric Trials Network (PTN) for which the applicant is PI and chair. The network has 27 active clinical trials and pharmacoepidemiology projects evaluating the pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of 38 therapeutics. The breadth of the program is possible because the candidate successfully developed three young investigators who have secured their own NIH funding and their own mentees.  In addition to offering research opportunities for the duration of the application, strengths of Dr. Benjamin's program include the unparalleled research infrastructure of the world's largest academic research organization, Duke Clinical Research Institute, and a longstanding academic partnership with the renowned University of North Carolina School of Pharmacy. Through this integral partnership, Dr. Benjamin has developed an NIH-sponsored fellowship training program and a pathway for pediatricians to secure PhD- level training in clinical pharmacology and pharmacoepidemiology.  In this competitive renewal, the applicant seeks to continue using the PTN as a platform for mentorship of young investigators from both within and outside Duke University. Trainees in clinical pharmacology across the US will be recruited to lead network research projects. Specifically, the proposed Antimicrobial Cerebrospinal Fluid Pharmacokinetics in High-Risk Infants PTN study will offer mentees the opportunity to capitilize on the research program that Dr. Benjamin has developed.  Feasibility of the proposed program expansion to national prominence and multi-institutional collaborative mentorship is shown by funding and career development of current trainees at Duke and UNC, by trainees' publication track record (over 90 peer-reviewed articles with trainees as first author, and by the initial mentorship of young investigators from other institutions including Children's Mercy Hospital, University of Louisville, and University California-San Diego."
"9364950","Abstract Exposure to addictive drugs or alcohol modifies synaptic transmission, leading to drug-evoked aberrant synaptic plasticity, which is believed to control the reinforcement of drug or alcohol intake. The dorsal striatum, a crucial brain region for the expression of habit and goal-directed behaviors, has been linked to addiction. We recently reported that excessive alcohol intake caused long-lasting potentiation of glutamatergic transmission in striatal neurons expressing dopamine D1 receptors (D1-neurons), and sustained depression of glutamatergic activity in striatal neurons bearing D2 receptors (D2-neurons) (Wang et al., Journal of Neuroscience, 2015; Cheng et al., Biological Psychiatry, 2016). Although reversal of drug-evoked synaptic plasticity has been reported to reduce drug intake persistently, very little is known about which neuronal types are involved or whether this reversal alters alcohol intake. Thus, the goal of this application is to reverse alcohol-induced aberrant synaptic plasticity in striatal D1- and D2-neurons and thereby persistently reduce alcohol-seeking and relapse, with the long-term objective of determining how such reversal can be used to treat alcohol use disorder. Our hypothesis, based in part on our preliminary results, is that in vivo optogenetic induction of long-term depression (LTD) in striatal D1-neurons or long-term potentiation (LTP) in D2-neurons causes long- lasting reductions in operant alcohol seeking and relapse. We will test this hypothesis by pursuing the following three specific aims: 1) to determine whether induction of LTD and LTP in striatal slices from alcohol- drinking rats normalizes glutamatergic transmission; 2) to determine whether in vivo prefrontal cortical inputs and D1-neuron activity are enhanced by excessive alcohol intake and reversed by LTD induction; and 3) to determine whether optogenetic and pharmacological reversal of alcohol-evoked corticostriatal plasticity can persistently reduce alcohol seeking and relapse behaviors in rats. This application is highly innovative because it applies state-of-the-art approaches, including a combination of dual-channel optogenetics and in vivo fiber photometry calcium imaging, allowing us for the first time to determine how normalization of alcohol-evoked synaptic plasticity in specific neuronal populations alters their activities in vivo and thus decreases alcohol- drinking behavior persistently; these important questions cannot be addressed using conventional methodologies. Knowledge generated from this proposal will provide novel strategies for long-term treatment of alcohol use disorder."
"9357591","PROJECT SUMMARY DK70977 retains its focus on gnotobiotic models of the dynamic operations the human gut microbiota, and the development of new experimental designs/tools to analyze how dietary components, specifically different prebiotic polysaccharides added to diets representative of those consumed in the USA, shape microbial community structure/function. It is based on the following advances and leverages a partnership between 2 labs with complementary expertise. (1) Methods for creating clonally arrayed sequenced `personal' culture collections that capture the majority of bacterial taxa present in a human fecal microbiota sample. (2) Finding that culture collections from twins stably discordant for obesity transmit the donor's discordant adiposity phenotypes plus obesity-associated metabolic abnormalities to germfree (GF) mice. Co-housing results in invasion of specific bacterial species from the lean (Ln) community into the guts of cagemates harboring Ob co-twin's culture collection, preventing obesity and associated metabolic abnormalities. Invasion, principally by members of the Bacteroides occurs with a representative USA diet low in saturated fats/high fruits-vegetables diet (LoSF/HiFV) but not with a HiSF/LoFV diet. (3) Methods for performing genome-wide transposon mutagenesis of multiple Bacteroides strains and simultaneously identifying genes/metabolic pathways that confer their fitness in specified diet/community contexts (multi-taxon insertion sequencing, INSeq). (4) Methods for generating GF piglets. We will pursue 2 aims. Aim 1, Perform diet oscillation studies in Ln-colonized mice fed 160 different HiSF/LoFV diets supplemented with 40 different purified plant polysaccharides (PPS) in varying doses, some from the waste-streams of commercial food processing, and identify PPS that produce the greatest increase in abundance of a single targeted Bacteroides (`high selectivity, large effect size lead) or significant increases in the greatest number of targeted Bacteroides (`broad range, significant effect size lead). Followup mechanistic studies using (i) these leads, fed monotonously at different doses, and in diet oscillations of different periodicity, plus (ii) multi-taxon INSeq, microbial RNA-Seq, new methods for multiplex quantitative proteomics, and metabolomics, are intended to provide new definitions/insights about niche, syntrophic partnerships, foodwebs, competitiveness, and their impact on community/host metabolism. Leads will also be tested with the Ob collection supplemented with Bacteroides invaders. Aim 2, Application of these methods to gnotobiotic piglets, colonized with these defined communities, fed HiSF/LoFV ± PPS leads and gavaged with `artificial microscopic nutrient platforms' consisting of fluorescently-labeled paramagnetic beads coated with different PPS, that can be retrieved from gut samples by FACS, should provide an unprecedented level of spatial and temporal detail of how community structure and function varies along the length of the gut, how nutrient sharing relationships are established and operate in different PPS and community contexts and establish the translatability of data obtained from gnotobiotic mice to this second more human-like model."
"9294125","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) are developmental disorders that occur in 1 out of every 500 live births, yet the cellular and molecular basis of these malformations has not been revealed. UPK3a, which encodes the type I transmembrane protein uroplakin 3a (UPK3a), is one gene targeted in CAKUT. Substitution of a Pro residue for a Leu (P273L) in the cytoplasmic domain of UPK3a leads to renal adysplasia and other urinary tract defects. However, the function(s) of UPK3a during urinary tract development, and the reason why mutations in this protein lead to CAKUT are not known. Using zebrafish larvae, we find that loss of expression of the UPK3a ortholog Upk3l leads to urinary tract (i.e., pronephros) dysfunction as a result of altered expression of Par polarity complex proteins (Par3, Par6, aPKC?) and defects in ezrin activation and microvilli formation. Moreover, our recent genetic and biochemical studies demonstrate that UPK3a/Upk3l may exert its influence by binding to aPKC? and then by fostering interactions between aPKC? and ezrin at the apical pole of pronephric tubule epithelial cells. Based on these observations, we propose that urinary tract development is dependent on the ability of UPK3a to promote UEEC differentiation, and mutations in UPK3a (e.g., P273L) perturb this function, leading to CAKUT. In our first aim we will use biochemistry to further define the cytoplasmic motifs in UPK3a and Upk3l that bind to the Par complex proteins and vice-versa. We will also define whether recruitment of the Par complex to the apical membrane of pronephric tubule cells depends on interactions with UPK3a/Upk3l. Furthermore, we will ectopically express UPK3a/Upk3l in MDCK cells, which do not normally express these proteins, and assess what impact this has on Par complex recruitment. In the second aim we will define how ezrin interacts with UPK3a/Upk3l and whether this interaction is critical for microvilli formation. We will further define whether aPKC? is responsible for phosphorylating ezrin-T567, a critical step in ezrin activation. In the third aim we will use MDCK cells as a model system to explore whether the P273L mutation alters ER exit and apical surface delivery of UPK3a. We will also use biochemistry and NMR spectroscopy to define whether the C-terminal tail of UPK3a contains structure, whether this structure is perturbed by the P273L mutation, and whether this mutation affects interactions with its binding partners. The proposed work is important because it will provide fundamental new insights into the basic mechanisms of lower urinary tract development and epithelial differentiation, into the role of UPK3a in these processes, and into the molecular and cellular basis of CAKUT."

The Node 1) designs and implements clinical trials of evidence-based treatments of addiction through rapid recruitment of diverse study participants in partnership with NIDA and the CTN, 2) generates peer-reviewed publications in collaboration with treatment providers and other nodes, and 3) uses the CTN as a platform for training, dissemination, and research applications. The Regional Research and Training Center includes talented faculty and staff from Oregon Health & Science Center and University of California, San Francisco as well as leaders of affiliated healthcare partners providing integrated primary care and substance use disorder treatment. The Node was created in 2010 as an amalgam of two CTN Nodes--California-Arizona and Oregon/Hawaii (a charter member of the CTN). The Node was highly successful, during the current award, participating in 10 CTN trials, co-leading two of these and leading one; reporting results of CTN main studies, ancillary, and research using the CTN platform in 100+ publications, and actively disseminating evidence- based practices in 200 presentations. Node investigators also sought and received awards for 10 studies that used the CTN as a platform for research. Eight WS Node healthcare programs recruited over 1,300 participants into CTN studies. In the coming grant period the Node expands to include three national and regional primary care and HIV primary care research networks: OCHIN, the HIV Research Network, and the Oregon Rural Practice-Based Research Network (ORPRN). The Node retains core addiction treatment centers experienced in CTN protocols and exploits their links with primary care: Adapt (Roseburg, OR), CODA (Portland, OR) HealthRIGHT 360 (San Francisco, CA), La Frontera (Tucson, AZ), NARA (Portland, OR), and Signal Behavioral Health Network (Denver, CO). The Node's research agenda proposes study concepts that evaluate three strategies to integrate and enhance addiction treatment within healthcare settings. Study 1 builds a patient registry for HCV infection and tests a multi-contact brief intervention for alcohol use. Study 2 extends the registry testing a candidate therapeutic HIV vaccine. Study 3, a test of reverse integration (primary care clinicians in addiction treatment settings), assesses naloxone distribution and education to reduce fatal and nonfatal opioid overdoses and measures impact on return to use. Finally the WS Node continues to use the CTN as a platform for training, dissemination, and research applications. The Node has the potential to accelerate the advancement of integrated primary care and addiction in the coming years."
"9331330","The broad objective of the proposed research and training is to understand the mechanisms that underlie efficient language comprehension and how these are altered in persons with language impairment, specifically aphasia. Recent theories of language processing have proposed that communication is typically subject to noise (e.g., Gibson, Bergen, & Piantadosi, 2013)?in the form of speaker error, environmental noise, or listener misperception?and that comprehenders employ rational integration of prior knowledge and noisy evidence to infer the intended meaning of the corrupted message. Further, Gibson, Sandberg, Fedorenko, Bergen, & Kiran (in press) propose that failures to use syntactic cues and an over-reliance on plausibility information by persons with agrammatic aphasia can be explained by the same noisy-channel framework, rather than a syntactic deficit. On this account, persons with aphasia simply have a higher base level of noise in their representation of how a message is likely to be corrupted. These novel proposals raise important questions about language processing in healthy individuals, as well as persons with aphasia. The proposed work will examine the learning and memory mechanisms that support the representation of the noise model.  Aim 1. To determine whether listeners adapt to specific properties of the noise and to what extent the  representations are tied to the context in which they are experienced.  Aim 2. To investigate whether the representation of noise and adaptation mechanisms differ between  healthy individuals and persons with agrammatic aphasia.  In the proposed experiments, we will address these aims by comparing persons with agrammatic aphasia to neurologically healthy controls and brain damaged controls. Participants will be exposed to sentences, some of which contain errors (i.e., noise), and asked to interpret their meaning. The critical sentences will be grammatically correct but implausible based on world knowledge (e.g. ?The mother gave the candle the daughter.?). If participants assume the intended sentence was actually, ?The mother gave the candle to the daughter,? that indicates that, in their model of the noise, the deletion of one word is very likely. The noise will be manipulated in various ways to test whether participants can learn specific features of the noise (e.g., that some errors are more likely than others), bind features of the noise to the context (e.g., that some errors are more likely but only given a particular speaker), or flexibly exert control over their own adaptation (e.g., adjust their expectations if they are told the speaker's errors were due to an external disturbance that has been removed). Findings from this research will bring us one step closer to understanding how the language processing system, in healthy individuals, accomplishes such efficient communication in the face of variable noise. Furthermore, understanding how these noise-adaptation mechanisms operate in aphasia will contribute to the development of treatments for persons with aphasia."
"9246320","The Systems Biology Core (SBC) will serve as a computational analysis bridge between the highly standardized data management and processing objectives of the Data Management and Analysis Core (DMAC) and the immunological and biological analysis objectives of Project 1 and Project 2. Although the specific biological context and many assays in Project 1 and Project 2 are distinct, the computational strategies for hypothesis generation and correlate discovery and testing are shared. A strategic synergy between the Projects is therefore realized by centrally locating the computational biology analytical expertise as a common resource within the SBC as opposed to each individual Project. Additionally, the SBC will have as a unique Aim the integration of immunological and molecular correlates and hypotheses from the two Projects. Starting from the standardized and pre-processed data from the DMAC, the SBC will develop and apply integrative computational algorithms to support the proposed analyses in Project 1 and Project 2."

"8106990","Project 2 will examine the role of infiltrating immune cells in the renal medulla in the pathogenesis of  salt-sensitive hypertension and renal injury. Preliminary and published data indicate that salt-sensitive  hypertension in both a genetic and an experimental rat model of disease is associated with extensive renal  injury, infiltration of immune cells into the kidney, and increased intrarenal angiotensin II (ANGII) levels.  Interestingly, pharmacological blockade of the immune system or of ANGII receptors attenuates the  development of hypertension and kidney damage in these disease models. Furthermore, administration of  immunosuppressive drugs directly into the renal medullary interstitial space decreases the severity of  hypertension, indicating that immune cell infiltration in the renal medulla is important in the pathophysiology of  salt-sensitive hypertension. Using these novel data as a rationale and a unique integrative experimental  approach, we will test the hypothesis that the infiltration of immune cells into the renal medulla following an  initial increase in arterial blood pressure after exposure to a high salt diet (4% NaCI) mediates the further  development of hypertension and kidney disease in Dahl Salt-Sensitive (SS) rats and in the salt-sensitive  hypertension that occurs following apparent recovery from renal ischemia-reperfusion injury in normal rats. We  further propose that the immune cells act by releasing ANGII which serves to increase the severity of  hypertension and renal damage. This novel hypothesis will be addressed in three Specific Aims. Aim 1 will  determine the importance of immune cell infiltration into the renal medullary interstitial space in the secondary  phase of genetic and experimental forms of salt-sensitive hypertension. Aim 2 will determine the ability of  infiltrating immune cells to synthesize and release ANGII into the kidney in experimental and genetic forms of  salt-sensitive hypertension. Aim 3 will determine the role of infiltrating immune cells in the kidney on renal  hemodynamics and the renal handling of sodium and water in experimental and genetic forms of salt-sensitive  hypertension."
"8114884","The defining feature of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is irreversible airflow limitation measured during forced expiration. This results from a varying combination of increased airflow resistance in the small airways and decreased elastic recoil due to emphysematous destruction of lung tissue. We recently showed that significant obstruction of the small airways is present in the lungs of patients with advanced emphysema and that the inflammatory response in the peripheral lung tissue correlates with the severity of COPD as gauged by the GOLD classification scheme. Quantitative analysis of the inflammatory response found strong correlation with the level of lung infiltration by CD8+ T cells, B cells, and macrophages and suggested that these cell types may specially serve to drive the COPD phenotype. Using CT and 3He magnetic resonance imaging (3He MRI) to quantitatively assess regional differences in small airway obstruction and emphysematous destruction in severe COPD, our imaging group has found that regions of mild to moderate disease are found adjacent to sites of severe destruction or obstructive disease even in patients with GOLD 4-stage disease. We hypothesize that the different levels of lesion severity represent different stages in the pathogenesis of the lesions. Our active lung transplantation program, expertise in new imaging technologies and the ability to conduct quantitative analysis of the inflammatory response and tissue remodeling afford a unique opportunity to construct new criteria for assessment of COPD patients. We propose to investigate the pathogenesis of GOLD 4-stage COPD in patients awaiting lung transplant with the following Specific Aims: 1) To test the hypothesis that there is progression in both extent and severity of the inflammatory immune process in regions affected by moderate to severe degrees of emphysema and small airway disease, using morphologic analysis and quantitative immunopathology to characterize the inflammatory immune process. 2) To noninvasively quantify the regional extent and severity of disease separately in subjects with severe COPD using 3He MRI and high-resolution CT imaging. 3) To validate the in-vivo and ex-vivo imaging results in Aim II against the histology in Aim I in order to develop a new approach to quantifying both the extent and severity of emphysema and small airways disease within the lungs of individual patients with COPD."
"8106516","The Tissue Culture Core Laboratory will be responsible for providing investigators with cultured cells, antibodies, and facilities for routine microscopic analysis of biological samples. The core will be directed by Dr. Goldstein. He will be assisted by Drs. Y.K. Ho, Richard Anderson, Joachim Herz, and Rob Rawson. The technical work in the Tissue Culture Facility of this Core is carried out by four experienced technicians (Lisa Beatty, Angela Carroll, Jill Fairless, Marissa Hodgin) and one laboratory assistant (Rose Marshall). The Tissue Culture Facility of this Core is located in the Department of Molecular Genetics and consists of three suites of rooms that are used solely for tissue culture. One suite contains four work modules that open into a common work area; the second suite contains three work modules that open into a common work area; and the third suite contains two work modules, one for adenovirus work and the other for baculovirus. Each module is equipped with a sterile work area (Biological Safety Cabinet hood), one or more CO2 incubators, a refrigerator, and an inverted microscope. The common work area in each of the suites contains one or two sterile work areas. The entire facility contains a total of 12 inverted microscopes (6 of which are phase-contrast microscopes), 1 stereo microscope, 15 sterile work areas (hoods), 28 singlechamber CO2 incubators, 2 non-CO2 refrigerated incubators, 1 roller bottle incubator, 3 refrigerated incubator shakers, 3 table-top refrigerated centrifuges, and 9 refrigerators. Four liquid nitrogen freezers for storage of cell lines are located in the common work area adjacent to the work modules. In addition to this standard equipment, we have a Zeiss Axiovert 35 M inverted fluorescence microscope that allows us to visualize cells directly in the Petri dish (under sterile conditions) so as to determine whether or not they have taken up reconstituted fluorescent LDL. This method is the assay of choice for identifying and monitoring mutant cholesterol auxotrophic cell clones that are resistant to amphotericin and thus fail to take up fluorescent LDL (Research Project 1). The success of the entire Program Project depends on the smooth operation of the Tissue Culture Facility. Each of the six Research Projects will depend directly on the availability of cultured cells. Over the past 33 years, we have developed considerable experience in maintaining and growing multiple cell types, including diploid human fibroblasts, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, Sp2/O-Ag14 myeloma cells, simian COS cells, human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells, rat-1 fibroblasts, mouse embryonic fibroblasts, human lymphoblastoid cells, HeLa cells, rat FT02B hepatoma cells, human Huh-7 hepatoma cells, SV-40 transformed fibroblasts (SV-589), Sf9 insect cells, High Five insect cells, and Drosophila S2 cells. We have also become expert in culturing pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cells (ES cells), which will be used in Research Projects 2, 3, 5, and 6 for gene targeting experiments. Since 1973, over 1000 different primary human fibroblast cell strains, derived from skin biopsies from normal subjects as well as from patients with metabolic disorders, have been initiated in our laboratory. Multiple aliquots of cells from early passages of each of these strains are stored in liquid nitrogen. Our collection of frozen mutant cell lines includes fibroblasts from more than 160 subjects with the homozygous form of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Remarkably, we have been successful in carrying out metabolic experiments on mutant fibroblasts that we froze away 32 years ago. Since 1984, thousands of transfection experiments have been carried out in which we have introduced into various cell lines multiple plasmid constructs containing either the protein-coding region or the promoter regions of the genes for the LDL receptor, HMG CoA reductase, HMG CoA synthase, the oxysterol binding protein, SREBP-1 and -2, SCAP, Site-1 protease, Site-2 protease, lnsig-1 and -2, and.a and psubunits of farnesyltransferasel and a and ft-subunits of Rab geranylgeranyl transferase, REP-1 and -2, cholesterol 7-hydroxylase, oxysterol 7-hydroxylase, VLDL receptor, various domains of LRP, RAP, ApoER2, SR-B1 scavenger receptor, ARM, ABCG5/8, PCSK9, etc. From these transfections, more than 1200 stable and permanent cell lines have been established and used for biochemical analyses. Multiple aliquots of each of these transfected cell lines have been frozen in liquid nitrogen. These numbers do not include the thousands of transient transfections performed in HEK-293, COS, CHO cells, and SV589 cells. Based on current experience, we anticipate that we will be setting up for experiments approximately 600 Petri dishes of cells each day, of which 350 will be small dishes (60-mm) and 250 will be large dishes (100-mm). We have learned that certain aspects of quality control are essential in obtaining reproducible results for metabolic experiments in tissue culture cells. The following measures are rigorously enforced in our dayto- day operation: 1) An aliquot of calf serum from each batch of 100 liters is pretested prior to its general use so as to ensure that the serum is not toxic to our fibroblasts and that it supports a high cloning efficiency for CHO cells. 2) Cells in current use are routinely checked for Mycoplasma contamination in two ways: 1) by sending aliquots of the medium from 10 different cell lines to the ATCC Mycoplasma Testing Service (Manassas, VA) once per year; and 2) by our own testing with the use of a Myoplasma PCR Elisa test kit (Roche). 3) The generation time of each human fibroblast cell strain is monitored by a standard procedure, as follows: each week, each confluent stock flask is split 1:2, and the passage number is raised by 2. All stock flasks are discarded when the passage number exceeds 25. This procedure ensures that the growth rates of different aliquots of the same cell strain do not differ appreciably, and it also ensures that our experiments are carried out on cells that are well within Phase II of their growth cycle (Littlefield, J.W. In Variation, Senescence, and Neoplasia in Cultured Somatic Cells. Harvard University Press, Boston, 1976. pp. 54-77). 4) In setting up a typical experiment with nontransfected or permanently transfected cells, cells from the stock flasks are trypsinized under rigidly controlled conditions, counted using a hemacytometer, and 10 to 30 replicate dishes of cells are prepared under identical conditions. 5) In experiments designed to compare a normal and a mutant cell line or a nontransfected and a transfected cell line, Petri dishes of cells from both cell lines are always set up in parallel on the same day and grown in the same medium side by side in the same incubator. With these precautions, among others, our laboratory has been able to generate data on fibroblasts and other cell types that are reproducible from year to year, thus enabling rapid progress in the delineation of metabolic processes. In addition to the maintenance of stock cell lines and preparation of cultured cells for experiments, the Tissue Culture Core will be involved in the following activities: 1) Maintenance of our previously characterized hybridoma cell lines in suspension culture (in roller bottles) and production of large amounts of IgG fractions of monoclonal antibodies from culture medium. The following monoclonal antibodies are currently being produced and purified by Protein G column chromatography for use by investigators in the Program Project: anti-LDL receptor (lgG-C7); anti-SREBP-1 and anti-SREBP-2 (lgG-2A4, lgG-7D4, lgG-1C6, lgG-1D2); anti-Scap (lgG-9D5); anti-HMG CoA reductase (lgG-A9); and anti-Myc (lgG-9E10). Several new monoclonal antibodies against the membrane domain of Scap and against different domains of PCSK9 are currently being characterized. Moreover, mice have recently been injected with purified human lnsig-1 and lnsig-2 for producing hybridomas. 2) Purification by Protein G chromatography of more than 20 different polyclonal rabbit antibodies directed against the multiple proteins that are studied in this Program Project Grant. 3) Growth of large volumes of HEK-293S cells in suspension culture that allow the efficient transfection of cDNAs and the production of their encoded proteins. The HEK-293S cells have proved extremely valuable in the initial evaluation of the functional properties of proteins produced by newly cloned cDNAs. 4) Isolating, maintaining, and freezing away cloned cell lines that have been transfected with mutated versions of various cDNA and promoter constructs"
"8114891","ABSTRACT NOT PROVIDED"
"8114906","COPD is characterized by limitation of expiratory airflow that is not reversible. The primary site of the airflow limitation is the small airways. Smoking cessation and/or corticosteroid therapy only partially improves the airflow limitation in COPD. It is not known whether these therapies fail because of irreversible structural changes or because they have limited effect on the abnormal biologic processes in the small airways. This project focuses on the biologic changes in the small airway epithelium in COPD, and the reversibility of these changes with therapeutic intervention. We hypothesize that smoking cessation and/or anti-inflammatory therapies do normalize some of the altered patterns of gene expression in the small airway epithelium in COPD, and that the identification of the alterations in small airway epithelial gene expression that are, andare not, reversed by these interventions will provide targets for the future development of therapies for COPD. Using newly developed technology with fiberoptic bronchoscopy with brushings of the small airways to obtain pure small airway epithelium, microarray assessment in COPD vs normal smokers and non-smokers allowed us to identify genes in different categories relevant to the pathogenesis of COPD. This molecular signature of the small airway epithelium is the focus of the 3 aims of this proposal. Aim 1 - to assess the hypothesis that the alterations in gene expression in the small airway epithelium associated with COPD are at least partially reversible with smoking cessation. We propose to study healthy smokers and nonsmokers, individuals with COPD (GOLD 0,1,and III), and individuals with early emphysema who do not meet the GOLD criteria. Gene expression will be evaluated at baseline and after smoking cessation. Aim 2 - To assess the hypothesis that the alterations in gene expression in the small airway epithelium associated with COPD are at least partially reversible with treatment with corticosteroid. Aim 3 - To assess the hypothesis that the alterations in gene expression in the small airway epithelium associated with COPD are at least partially reversible with treatment with an inhibitor of leukotriene synthesis."
"9404571","Abstract Despite recent progress, Black Americans continue to bear the most severe burden of HIV/AIDS in the nation, and young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) continue to be most affected. Antiretroviral pre- exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been endorsed as a potentially effective part of HIV combination prevention strategies and an opportunity to reduce new infections among YBMSM. However, without significant efforts to develop age and culturally-tailored PrEP interventions for YBMSM, PrEP use may only be accessible and utilized by older, White, more affluent MSM, further exacerbating HIV disparities. Through the framework of intersectionality, the proposed research examines how various, intersectional stigmas may limit YBMSM?s ability and willingness to use PrEP. Various stigmas experienced by Black MSM (homonegativity, racism) are associated with adverse outcomes along the HIV care continuum and there is reason to believe these stigmas may also negatively affect PrEP outcomes. The proposed study aims to address the current lack of research on YBMSM?s barriers to using PrEP and gather the data necessary to inform a tailored intervention for YBMSM. The study will take place in Milwaukee, WI. In phase I, we will conduct 9 focus groups (n=72-90) with YBMSM ages 16-25 to explore YBMSM?s knowledge and perceptions of PrEP, identify individual, community and structural level factors likely to affect PrEP uptake among YBMSM, and examine YBMSM?s general healthcare utilization patterns and barriers. Additionally, we will employ a quantitative study to examine the relationship between various stigmas (racism, medical mistrust, homonegativity) and examine the effects of intersecting stigmas on knowledge and acceptance of PrEP among 300 YBMSM. We hypothesize that racism, homonegativity, and the intersection of those stigmas will predict lower knowledge of PrEP, reduced likelihood of using PrEP, and greater PrEP stigma. We also hypothesize that the relationships between various stigmas and PrEP outcomes will be moderated by resiliency and social support. In Phase II, we will use findings from Phase I and community-based participatory research methods to develop an evidence-based multi-level intervention tailored to YBMSM to be tested in a future R34. Findings from this study may not only be useful in increasing PrEP use among YBMSM, but may also be generalized to other outcomes along the care continuum. The training plan in this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) application will provide the training and research experience necessary to support Dr. Katherine Quinn?s transition to an independent HIV prevention and intervention researcher. Training includes four primary goals: build content expertise in intersectional stigma, develop mastery of complex statistical modeling for intersectionality and mixed-methods research, build expertise in intervention science, and enhance career and professional development. The training acquired by Dr. Quinn includes didactic coursework, academic conferences, manuscript preparation, independent study, grant writing workshops and other research activities."
"9516308","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anxiety and mood dysregulation are among the most common, often persistent, emotional difficulties in preschool-aged children that cause substantial personal, familial, and economic burden. However, these behaviors are developmentally normative in young children and the level at which such behaviors may be clinically significant is largely unknown. Without established norms identified with developmentally sensitive methods, it is difficult to distinguish mild, transient behaviors from rik for persistent, impairing emotional and behavior problems. Studies have relied solely on parents' judgment to report the subjective frequency of children's behavior and focused primarily on externalizing problems. Information about the daily frequencies of children's anxiety and mood dysregulation, along with familial and physiological correlates of emotional difficulties, wil permit an understanding of the variation in behavior that may increase clinical risk. The primary goal of the present study is to implement a multi-level approach to generate developmentally meaningful distinctions between normative individual differences and patterns of behavior, family environment, and stress physiology that pertain to the development of early-emerging internalizing psychopathology in 3-5-year-old children. To achieve this aim, a novel parent-report daily diary method will be used to generate dimensional phenotypes by assessing the daily frequency of anxiety and mood dysregulation in a large sample (N = 550) of preschool-aged children. To validate the internalizing phenotypes and enhance differentiation of typical from clinically-concerning behavior, the second aim will be to assess children's observed behavior, impairment, parental psychopathology, behavior, and relationship satisfaction, and stressors in a subsample (n = 200) and the third aim will assess acute and chronic stress physiology, including salivary inflammatory markers (C- reactive protein and cytokines) as well as cumulative hypothalamic pituitary axis cortisol activity measured via hair samples. These efforts will advance the NIMH mission to better understand mental illness trajectories. In particular, this work is consistent with Strategic Objective 1.4 to develop valid dimensional phenotypes by assessing biological and behavioral components that clarify the boundaries of mental disorders and delineate the full variation of behavior, and Strategic Objective 2.1 that emphasizes the importance of identifying bio- and behavioral markers of early-emerging psychopathology. Knowledge gained from this proposal will significantly advance the field by 1) providing developmentally sensitive information on the phenomenology of early- emerging psychopathology, 2) advancing the transdiagnostic, dimensional approach by assessing the full variation of anxiety and mood dysregulation, 3) identifying biomarkers that reflect early deviation in emotional development, and 4) inform prevention and intervention efforts for internalizing psychopathology; in addition, consistent with the R15 mechanism, this study will strengthen the PI's instutition's research environment by providing students in-depth experience with multi-method research in developmental psychopathology."
"9355701","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Key populations within the generalized HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) have received insufficient attention including female sex workers (FSWs), a group with HIV prevalence substantially higher than the general population and a major contributor to the HIV epidemic in Kenya. Young FSWs (18-24 years old), a vulnerable population, are at highest risk among FSWs and require tailored biomedical, behavioral and structural interventions to counter the epidemiological and contextual complexities they face. We propose the IPrEP Research Project which includes: 1) formative research, inclusive of qualitative research among young FSWs, male clients (MCs) to elucidate life challenges, motivations and perceptions of HIV risks; risk behaviors; knowledge, attitudes about HIV and HIV prevention, including PrEP; preferences for adherence support; and sex partner relations. Interviews with health care providers (HCPs) will assess knowledge regarding HIV prevention and PrEP and attitudes towards FSWs; 2) an enhanced oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) study among young FSWs to determine the uptake, adherence, feasibility and acceptability of combination strategy of PrEP, a biomedical intervention, with behavioral and structural adherence interventions (peer support versus reminders and resource transfer) and risk-reduction counseling intervention; 3) feasibility study for recruitment and retention of MCs with assessment of acceptability of risk-reduction counseling intervention; 4) cost-effectiveness analysis in collaboration with University of Nairobi (UoN) of the combination PrEP strategies to inform implementation and scale-up and 5) capacity building in implementation research for nurse faculty and students at UoN building on PEPFAR Nursing Education Partnership Initiative (NEPI) experience and infrastructure.  The proposed research is distinguished by several innovations, including focus on young FSW, a population a high risk in a geographic HIV hotspot in Kenya, as well as on MCs and HCPs who play key roles in access by FSWs to prevention services and to prevention methods. The research includes implementation of theoretically- driven combination prevention strategies inclusive of biomedical, behavioral and structural interventions and an intervention aimed to decrease sexual risk compensation and risk behaviors; the assessment of HCPs' knowledge and attitudes regarding HIV prevention, including PrEP, and FSWs; cost-effectiveness analysis to inform implementation and scale-up within PEPFAR-supported programs, as well as a commitment to building capacity to design, implement and analyze findings from implementation studies working with nursing partner.  The ultimate goal of our research is to identify how PrEP can be effectively implemented for this young population at substantial risk for HIV decreasing their risk of HIV acquisition, consequently diminishing the overall number of new HIV infections in Kenya and similar settings. Findings from this research will also inform PEPFAR as it aims to stem the spread of HIV through the effective use of evidence-based interventions."
"9301467","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application seeks support for an interdisciplinary predoctoral and postdoctoral fellowship program that joins together three highly successful, research fellowship training programs from Boston University School of Medicine and adds a fourth from Boston University School of Public Health. The principal objective of the program is to train emerging researchers in three overlapping domains: (1) how health reform impacts urban, low-income families; (2) conduct research that improves the quality of care provided to low-income populations, and (3) provide trainees the knowledge and skills to shape future health policy for vulnerable populations. Since 2000, the combined programs have had 45 graduates in their research tracks of whom two-thirds are currently clinician-investigator faculty in Departments of Family Medicine, Pediatrics, Internal Medicine, or Health Policy/Management in the nation's medical schools, teaching hospitals and schools of public health. Moreover, three-quarters of them devote at least 50% time to their research careers. Their publication and grant record indicates that they have already successfully launched their research careers. These publications substantially address the health care issues and unmet health care needs of our target population: vulnerable people who reside in inner-city urban areas.  The programs have individually received prior training grants, including over ten HRSA Title VII Faculty Development Program Grant Awards, most recently in 2011-2016. Together the departments have over $27 million in current research grants, and program faculty members have extensive records of successful research mentoring. They include leaders in healthcare disparities, healthcare reform, prevention science, economics and health policy.  We seek support for four postdoctoral fellows and two predoctoral fellows in each funding year. The support for this innovative training opportunity will facilitate health services research training for future generations that is interdisciplinary and informed by primary care and public health perspectives. The program attracts qualified trainees, provides excellent training and guidance, and our curriculum is proven to launch graduates into productive academic research careers. The knowledge and skills provided in the training program will assist our graduates to perform research that will inform policy makers about the impact of health reform on urban, low- income families, and will provide important information that will be used to improve the quality of care provided to all Americans, especially those most in need."
"8112403","Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle}: FISHER. ARON B. PROJECT 5: Post-Translational Processing of Surfactant Protein C Michael F. Beers, M.D. University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine Project Leader Surafel Mulugeta, PhD University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine Co-Investigator Susan Guttentag, M.D. Children's Hospital of Phila. / U of PA School of Medicine Co-Investigator ABSTRACT Surfactant protein C (SP-C) is a 35 amino acid lung-specific hydrophobic peptide that enhances the biophysical activity of surfactant phospholipid. SP-C is synthesized as a 21 kD propeptide (proSP-C2-i) and post-translationally processed to yield the 3.7 kD surface active alveolar form via cleavage of NH2 and COOH flanking propeptides. Recently, the importance of SP-Cto lung health and disease has been underscored by observations that heterozygous expression of over 20 different mutations in the SP-C gene in humans is associated with chronic interstitial lung disease (ILD). The overall goal of this project is to extend well- established studies aimed at understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying SP-C biosynthesis and to assess the consequences of expression of a class of aggregation prone SP-C mutants associated withILD. The experimental approach involves both reductionist and integrative approaches to dissect out key elements in the targeting and post-translational processing of proSP-C2i in the secretory pathway. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypotheses that targeting of proSP-C to the regulated secretory pathway as an integral membrane protein is mediated by a PPDY motif within the NH2 flanking propedtide that modulates interactions with specific ligands and chaperones including W-W domains. These interactions will be studied both in situ using binding assays for recombinant proSP-C and in vitro utilizing proteomic analyses of co-immunoprecipitation products. Specific Aim 2 will extend studies directed at identification and characterization of proteases mediating processing cleavages of proSP-C. Candidate enzymes we have identified include aspartyl proteases Napsin A and Pepsinogen C that will be studied using in vitro translation and proteolysis of proSP-C integrated into membrane vesicles, in situ proteolysis using purified enzyme and recombinant proSP-C substrate, and siRNA approaches in cultured type 2 cells. In Specific Aim 3, mechanisms underlying cellular toxicity resulting from the expression of aggregating SP-C isoforms and the role of agents which modulate protein folding and cell function will be determined using well established in vitro models. These results will then be extended in vivo using transgenic expression of mutant SP-C constructs utilizing recently improved lung- and cell- specific promoter elements developed in our laboratory to create mice which express mutant SP-C precursors exclusively in alveolar type 2 cells.

We have a special emphasis on health disparities and improving quality. Our strength has been developing physicians to perform question-driven multidisciplinary research and preparing them to be independent investigators, with a special emphasis on developing minority investigators. Program Content: Our interdisciplinary two-year program combines a didactic curriculum designed to provide conceptual and practical foundations and core competencies in health services research coupled with their own independent research project leading to a Master's degree. Fellows are expected to complete all 30 courses in the formal curriculum and to integrate the resultant knowledge and skills in the design and conduct of their own independent research project with close supervision by faculty mentors. Fellows devote 70% of their time overall to their own project, which they present every 4-6 weeks at the Advanced Seminar in Health Services Research where mentors, program directors, and fellows provide group feedback. We request 6 post- doctoral slots for each year of the award. Program philosophy: A central tenet of our program's philosophy is that fellows' projects must be independent. We believe that the fellows' experience of initiating and carrying out their own projects is critical o the success of developing fellows to become independent investigators with their own unique research trajectory. Faculty: The program is built on the strengths of our faculty, who have a long history of interdisciplinary research, extensive experience in research training and mentoring, and an outstanding track record of funded research. These faculty, drawn from clinical epidemiology, health services research, behavioral science, biostatistics, health economics, informatics, health policy, and medical ethics, have collaborated on multiple, innovative and successful multidisciplinary research studies and training programs over the last decade.

"9295931","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The need to understand and ultimately improve the quality, efficiency, and effectiveness of health care in the United States has never been greater. The proposed program at the University of Michigan will create a unique synthesis of resources, multidisciplinary training activities, and stakeholder involvement that will prepare both predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees to meet the urgent challenges in health services research. The program will be an innovative partnership between the Department of Health Management and Policy (HMP) in the School of Public Health and the Center for Healthcare Outcomes & Policy (CHOP) in the Medical School. This partnership will build on the historical strengths of predoctoral training based in HMP, which has been supported by AHRQ and its predecessors for 26 years, and postdoctoral training in CHOP, which has yielded over a dozen early investigators who have gone on to acquire K awards in recent years. This partnership will integrate the complementary strengths of HMP's and CHOP's training environments. The research and training based in HMP reflects a broad public health perspective as well as a deep grounding in theories and methods from social sciences (e.g., economics, finance, sociology/organizational studies, operations research and decision science, and political science) that can be fruitfully applied to health services research. The research and training based in CHOP reflects clinical expertise (particularly in surgery and other specialties), strong partnerships with providers, health plans, and other stakeholders, and a tight focus on many of AHRQ's priority areas (costs, effectiveness, efficiency, access, safety/quality, and disparities). The program will support five predoctoral and two postdoctoral traineeship positions annually over five years. The training program focuses on four broad pedagogic competencies: 1) understanding the fundamentals of health services problems and issues; 2) understanding theory and methods from social science and health science disciplines, and how they can be applied to health services issues; 3) conducting health services research, both in independent, leading roles as well as supporting team-based roles; and, 4) developing oneself continuously as a health services scholar. These competencies will be instilled through multidisciplinary course work, team-based and independent research experience, mentoring of all trainees (pre- and postdoctoral) by faculty at both HMP and CHOP, and seminars and other opportunities for professional socialization and development. The performance of trainees and the program will be assessed by the Program Committee through a number of mechanisms and metrics, including external and internal feedback, and the evaluation results will be used to improve the program continuously."
"9315618","Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this project is to develop a portable, low-cost tool to aid in the diagnosis and management of neonates born with neurologic complications. The project will develop instrumentation technology and associated software to enable early detection of neurologic brain injury and seizure activity for newborns delivered in care facilities that lack a full suite of neurological diagnostic tools. In neonates with birth asphyxia, seizures are very common and most frequently subclinical. Many studies have observed that even experienced clinicians have difficulty correctly identifying seizures in this population. Subsequently, clinical paroxysms that do not truly represent seizure are frequently over-treated and subclinical seizures, including status epilepticus, go unrecognized and untreated. As such, the use of continuous video?electroencephalograph (EEG) monitoring is the gold standard for recognizing and treating seizures in this population. It is also very helpful at identifying which children have sustained brain injury, including hypoxia. This resource intense modality has become the standard of care at many tertiary medical centers but unfortunately remains unavailable to many clinicians at smaller birth facilities. Quantitative EEG, including the use of amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG), has gained widespread use at most neonatal ICUs, and represents a more user-friendly bedside tool for identifying brain injury and seizures. The proposed phase II project aims to design, build, and evaluate a low- cost telemedicine-enabled aEEG monitor and associated multi-instrument software package that supports widespread use of aEEG in community-based birth / care facilities."
"9385359","Project Summary  Violence, defined as homicide and assault, is one of the top five causes of death for individuals between the ages of 15-44. Individuals with mental illness (IMI) living in our communities are at higher risk than the general population for involvement in violence, as either perpetrators or victims. In the wake of numerous changes in service provision (including deinstitutionalization), family members have had to assume more caregiving responsibilities for their loved ones with mental illness. This means that family members have become both likely participants in violent encounters and potential resources for averting them. They can often initially recognize and forestall escalation toward serious violent incidents.  This study will take the first step toward developing a community-based intervention for IMI who engage in violence. The project is significant because it will lay the needed foundation for systematically developing and testing a targeted intervention to reduce violent events by involving families/caretakers in forestalling these incidents. It will have a significant public health impact by promoting the positive adjustment of IMI to the community by providing support for families or persons taking care of these individuals.  We will obtain narratives of the process prior to violent and potentially violent incidents involving the IMI from both the IMI and family members/caretakers. We will also collect structured measures of hypothesized key constructs. We will use a mixed methods approach to identify common and divergent themes in these incidents and to examine how identified constructs and processes escalate or reduce the chances of violence. The content and the analytic results will inform the development of a novel refinement of the family psychoeducation approach.  The preliminary data and revised model generated by this proposed R21 is the essential starting point for further work that examines the impact of providing structured therapeutic support and education for family members in defusing violence involving their loved one. It examines whether the potential targets of the proposed intervention are related to the occurrence of violent incidents and provides material for the development of a refined intervention. Successful completion of this project will produce a unique intervention (based on a proven method for reducing relapse) that can be tested in future effectiveness trials. The intervention, if successful, will increase community adjustment and reduce negative outcomes (e.g., housing instability, criminal justice involvement) for potentially violent IMIs in the community."
"9225648","Project Summary  Aedes aegypti is the principal mosquito vector of viruses that cause Zika, yellow fever, chikungunya, and dengue, the most widespread and significant arboviral disease in the world. Immature mosquitoes of this species are often concentrated in natural and artificial water-filled containers in urban environments and are susceptible to control efforts. Larviciding, the application of microbial or chemical agents to kill mosquito larvae before they are reproducing adults that transmit human disease pathogens, is a key component of integrated A. aegypti control strategies worldwide. However, given the frequent development of pesticide resistance and rising concerns about the off-target effects of pesticides, the current larvicide repertoire will soon reach its expiration date. It is therefore critical to identify new environmentally safe larvicidal agents for use in integrated A. aegypti control programs. Recent RNA interference (RNAi) studies have demonstrated that small interfering RNA (siRNA), which can be designed to be species-specific, can be used for selective targeting of A. aegypti larval genes. A recent high-throughput screen in our laboratory identified >100 larval lethal genes in A. aegypti. Although larval microinjection facilitated the screen, this technique cannot be used for RNAi in the field. The objective of the proposed investigation is to identify an effective and economical delivery system for species-specific interfering RNA larvicides targeting A. aegypti. This research program will test the hypothesis, which is supported by preliminary experiments, that interfering RNA produced and delivered in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast) can be utilized as mosquito larvicidal agents. S. cerevisiae, a model organism that is genetically tractable and inexpensive to culture, can be engineered to produce interfering RNA in the form of short hairpin RNA (shRNA), which is easily amplified through yeast cultivation. Yeast is both a strong odorant attractant and a source of nutrition for laboratory-bred A. aegypti larvae. Furthermore, yeast can be dried and packaged for storage and shipment, making it ideal for delivery to less economically developed countries. The aims of this investigation are to (1) express short hairpin RNA (shRNA) corresponding to A. aegypti larval lethal genes in S. cerevisiae and to (2) test this yeast interfering RNA delivery system in simulated- and semi-field experiments. This research program will generate necessary preliminary data for future proposals centered on conducting larger-scale semi-field and field studies at international field sites. These studies are requisite steps for advancement toward the long-term goal of including cost-effective species-specific yeast interfering RNA larvicides in integrated mosquito control programs."
"9526243","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complexity of intracellular signaling is demonstrated in the crosstalk between various signaling pathways and in their regulation by the ubiquitous analytes, such as ATP, ROS and cell metabolites, with mitochondria at the center stage. Thus, it is critical to monitor real-time activities of mitochondria to fully understand ther impact on cell signaling. Here, this team proposes to investigate if and how mitochondrial fission/fusion events, collectively called mtDynamics, modulate signaling events during environmental carcinogenesis by regulating mitochondrial ROS production in real time. To investigate such a precise role of mitochondria, we propose to develop a quantitative microscopy-based analytical method of Real Time Simultaneous Quantitative Assessment of the Redox Environment and Dynamics of Mitochondria (RT- SQuARED-M). In the R21 phase the performance of the RT-SQuARED-M method will be further developed and validated. After meeting the set R21 milestone, a broader scientific hypothesis in the R33 phase will be tested. The pioneering studies and new preliminary data demonstrate that repression of mtFission, which allows for unopposed mtFusion and repressed mitophagy, leads to a) increased cell proliferation, b) enhanced mtROS production from hotspots, and c) non-canonical recruitment of crucial cell cycle regulators on mitochondria. Based on these data, it is hypothesized that carcinogenicity caused by oxidative damage-inducing environmental polyhydrocarbons is initiated as mtDynamics-driven local mtROS modulates distinct mitochondrial sites for signaling and mitophagy. Using the RT-SQuARED-M method, we anticipate discovering 1) lower mtROS at the DRP1-driven mtFission sites define the mitophagic hotspots, while the higher mtROS at the MFN1/2-driven mtFusion sites define the signaling hotspots; 2) polyhydrocarbon carcinogens B[a]P and TCDD lower Drp1 driven-mtFission to repress mitophagic clearance and allow aberrant mtROS-based growth factor-cell cycle signaling in mitochondria to initiate lung and skin carcinogenesis. Discovery of such precise mitochondrial signaling that could be modulated by environmental carcinogens would be a paradigm shift in the role of mitochondria in environmental toxicity. This study, if successful, will reveal the mechanism of action behind the involvement of mitochondrial dynamics in lung and skin carcinogenesis and highlight key mitochondrial fission/fusion proteins (Drp1 and/or Mfn1/2) as potential targets for preventing initiation of lung and skin carcinogenesis. The proposed research team has expertise in all the methods and procedures required for successful development and application of the innovative RT- SQuARED-M method in understanding carcinogenesis of the lung and skin."
"9377948","Project Summary According to the World Health Organization, obesity has reached epidemic proportions worldwide, with at least 2.8 million people dying each year as a result of being overweight or obese. Obesity is a major risk factor for metabolic diseases such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and type 2 diabetes. The development of long-term strategies for obesity prevention and therapy requires a comprehensive understanding of metabolic regulatory networks that control adiposity. At the center of these networks are proteins of the lipin family that have been identified as crucial determinants of adipose tissue development and fat storage. Lipins are regulated in response to nutrients by insulin and the nutrient-sensitive TOR signaling pathway. In particular the TOR pathway controls movement of lipins into the cell nucleus where they participate in gene regulation. The major objective of this research project is to determine how lipins that are expressed in non-adipose tissues, in particular the endocrine system, contribute to metabolic regulation. The project will use a predominantly genetic approach to identify novel roles of lipins using the model organism Drosophila melanogaster. Besides the elaborate genetic tools that allow studies in whole, physiologically intact animals, Drosophila has the advantage of having only one Lipin gene, in contrast to three genes that complicate studies in humans and mammalian model systems. Using the novel CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we will create a series of Drosophila mutants carrying altered Lipin genes, including a mutant that expresses Lipin lacking the ability to enter the cell nucleus and, thus, participate in gene regulation, and a mutant expressing Lipin protein that exhibits constitutive nuclear localization. Other mutants will express Lipin proteins that cannot be modified by post- translational modifications of specific amino acid residues, which may affect nuclear translocation and other functions of the protein. These mutants, in combination with Lipin transgene expression in specific tissues, are expected to shed light on functions of lipins in non-adipose tissues and on novel signaling pathways that may participate in the functional regulation of lipins. Finally, the project will examine the role of Lipin in the production of a major steroid hormone that controls metabolism and development of Drosophila. It is anticipated that results of this aim will set the stage for the discovery of roles of lipins in endocrine tissues of humans and other mammals."
"9335340","Project Summary Renal ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) is a major source of medical morbidity and mortality, affecting diverse medical scenarios including transplantation, cardiac arrest, cardiopulmonary bypass, trauma, and vascular surgery. Despite the use of preservation solution and minimization of organ ischemia time, early allograft dysfunction occurs in at least 30% of deceased donor transplant recipients and this number is rising with the enhanced use of marginal organ donors. Impaired early graft function impacts long term graft performance and graft loss is a predictor of death. Despite significant efforts, no specific therapies to mitigate ischemic injury have reached clinical use. We have identified that inhibition of histone/protein deacetylases (HDACs), a family of proteins that remove acetyl groups from DNA-associated histone proteins as well as other groups of proteins, is effective in mitigating early renal functional impairment and the development of fibrosis after renal IRI. We have narrowed the specificity of this beneficial effect to the nuclear class I HDACs which tightly regulate broad patterns of gene expression. We have subsequently identified that HDAC2 deletion, even when confined to the kidney itself, conveys major protection from ischemia reperfusion injury. Conversely, deletion of closely homologous HDAC1 leads to impaired renal IRI tolerance. We thus propose to identify the mechanism behind the HDAC2 deletion effect with the intent of translating this benefit to clinically relevant scenarios of renal ischemia such as transplantation and cardiopulmonary bypass. Our proposal uses whole animal, cellular, and molecular approaches to define the role that class I HDACs play in renal ischemia tolerance. We will define remaining unanswered questions such as tissue specificity of effects in cold ischemia transplant models, understand tissue specificity by confining HDAC deletion to renal tubular epithelium, and use innovative hyperpolarized 13C MRI to identify if HDACs are altering in vivo metabolism. We will then use cellular approaches to assess whether inhibiting the deacetylase function of HDAC2 can reproduce the deletion effects, with the possibility of focusing translational targets on deacetylase inhibitors. Lastly, we will utilize molecular approaches to identify the impact that HDAC2 deletion has on nuclear corepressor complex formation, localization, and DNA binding, further highlighting possible mechanisms for future translation. Our studies intend to translate a highly novel finding of a single HDAC knockout drastically improving in vivo renal ischemia tolerance to a clinically approachable process by better understanding how the in vivo effects are achieved. This may have major impact on the development of strategies to minimize renal ischemic damage, which is a major source of cost and comorbidity in our health system."
"9334853","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The clinical literature is replete with studies that characterize structure and diversity of the gut microbiome through sequencing the 16S RNA gene and correlating the results to different disease states, including obesity. Yet, fundamental questions remain: Does the make-up of the gut microbiome matter in the development of obesity from the perspective of quantitative bioenergetics? How might we monitor and manipulate the gut microbiome to optimize its positive impact on the host? Two key findings from the existing literature support the critical role of the gut microbiome on body weight and point us towards answers to these two key questions. First, animal models support the global hypothesis that the composition of the gut microbiome leads to obesity via multiple mechanisms, including more energy extraction from foods. Second, the literature suggests that host factors -- namely, genetics and metabolic status -- play important roles in host/gut microbiome interactions. We hypothesize that the gut microbiome contributes to the host's energy balance in a quantifiable way and that we can change the magnitude of that contribution by managing microbial interactions and activity through diet. Aim 1: Create, test, and refine an integrated in silico model of energy balance in a metabolic ward setting using a typical Western diet vs. a Microbiome Enhancer (ME) diet consisting of whole foods. Clinical and laboratory data will be inputs to develop, test, and refine the model of microbial ecology/metabolism. Once the model is well developed, we will compare model outputs (predictions) to directly measured (observed) energy absorption using state-of-the-art metabolic-ward techniques. Aim 2: Explore the effect of a Western vs. ME diet on proximal and distal gut enteroendocrine secretions, gastric emptying, and small bowel transit time and relate these results to subjective hunger/satiety and measured food intake. Aim 3: Using modeled and measured energy balances, quantify the effect of a Western diet vs. ME diet on the microbial contribution to energy balance. Significance and Innovation: We have created a novel model that explicitly links the effects of microorganisms on human energy balance and modeled weight change. In addition, our proposed metabolic ward studies will make it possible for us to measure small changes in energy absorption, TDEE, and/or food intake that affect long-term weight gain or loss. The effects of changes in the microbial ecology on energy expenditure (EE) or food intake have never been studied under controlled metabolic ward conditions. Impact: These studies will, for the first time, quantify the gut microbiota contributions to the host's energy balance. By integrating clinical measurements, bioreactor experiments, and mathematical modeling, we will be able to describe cause-and-effect mechanisms. The studies will allow us to distinguish among effects stemming from a net change in energy absorption vs. alterations in energy expenditure and effects on hunger/ satiety. Our innovative methods also will provide quantitative insights to the microbiota contribution and enable future studies on the interacting roles of diet, the gut microbiome, and human physiology."

"9257893","Project Summary / Abstract Tetrachloroethylene (perchloroethylene, PCE) is a solvent commonly used in metal degreasing, textile processing, and dry cleaning. Because it is often used in poorly controlled settings, it is a common ground water and Superfund site contaminant. PCE has well-documented neurotoxic effects in highly exposed adults and there is increasing evidence for neurotoxic effects in prenatal and childhood exposures, critical periods of vulnerability for the developing nervous system. Our prior research found that early life exposure to PCE- contaminated drinking water was associated with substance abuse during adolescence and adulthood. However, early life exposure to social stressors is widely thought to influence this behavior, and we had limited information about how social stressors may have contributed to these associations. Thus, the proposed retrospective cohort study will examine early life exposure to PCE and social stressors, alone and in combination, to confirm and extend earlier results. Specifically, the proposed research will examine: (1) the dose-response relationship between early life exposure to PCE-contaminated drinking water and substance use (i.e. illicit drug use and unhealthy alcoholic beverage consumption) during adolescence and adulthood, (2) the dose-response relationship between early life exposure to social stressors (i.e. household dysfunction, child abuse and neglect) and substance use during adolescence and adulthood, and (3) how the relationship between early life exposure to PCE-contaminated drinking water and subsequent substance use is modified by early life exposure to social stressors. The study population will be a cohort of 4,000 individuals with prenatal and early childhood exposure to PCE-contaminated drinking water and a comparable group of 4,000 unexposed individuals born in Massachusetts and Rhode Island between 1969 and 1983. By using an interdisciplinary approach to assess a mixture of chemical and social stressors during a susceptible life stage, the findings will improve our understanding of the role of a common neurotoxin in the complex etiology of substance use, a condition associated with substantial morbidity and mortality in the US. The findings will also assist policy makers in determining exposure limits that protect pregnant women and young children, ensuring that US drinking water supplies are safe for all consumers."
"8114839","Calcium regulation in cardiac myocytes is central to excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) and is also involved in hypertrophic nuclear signaling. Two important and ubiquitous Ca regulatory systems, Ca-calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and inositol (1,4,5)P3 receptors (InsPsR) are present in myocytes, and have been implicated in altering ECC, arrhythmogenesis and nuclear signaling. However, surprisingly little is known about how these effects occur. Ca-dependent pathways implicated in regulating transcription in hypertrophy (Hyp) and heart failure (HF) include CaMKII, which may function via activation of nuclear export of type II histone deacetylases (HDAC) which otherwise repress transcription. Overall goals here are to understand better how CaMKII functions in cardiac myocytes with respect to acute Ca signaling (ECC & arrhythmogenesis) and how both InsPsR and CaMKII may be involved in nuclear signaling (via HDAC) in hypertrophy & HF. Main experimental methods include confocal fluorescence imaging (of Ca indicators & other fluorescent probes) and voltage clamp in isolated adult cardiac myocytes. Myocytes  will be isolated from mice (including CaMKIIS or lnsPaR2 knockout (KO) mice and mice subjected to aortic banding, Hyp) and rabbits (including our well characterized non-ischemic arrhythmogenic HF model). This project focuses on cellular aspects of CaMKII in 3 aims. Aim 1 will address acute CaMKII effects on ECC, with respect to 4 properties (Ca current facilitation, altered SR Ca release (during diastole and ECC), frequency-dependent acceleration of relaxation & recovery of SR transport during sustained acidosis). These will be assessed in CaMKIIS-KO mice and those in which a CaMKII inhibitory peptide is targeted specifically to the SR. Aim 2 will test a novel hypothesis about Ca-dependent nuclear signaling via a proposed local InsPsR-CaM-CaMKIIHDAC pathway that may respond preferentially to neurohumoral stimuli (e.g. endothelin-1) rather than the Ca transients associated with ECC. Local measurements of [Ca] and translocation of HDAC-GFP and fluorescent CaM will be used, along with pharmacological and molecular dissection (e.g. CaMKIISc- and lnsP3R2-KO mice). Aim 3 will assess altered CaMKII signaling in Hyp & HF regarding ECC, arrhythmias & HDAC activation. The expression and function of CaM, CaMKII & InsPsR in the alteration of  ECC, arrhythmogenesis and nuclear/ hypertrophic signaling via the above HDAC pathway will be assessed in both HF rabbits (from Core B) and Hyp mice from Project by Brown. The novel dual GFP FRET sensors for [InsPs] and CaMKII activity will also be incorporated into these studies as they are developed in Projects by Mignery and Brown. The proposed work will be integrated closely with the other three projects and will provide comprehensive new information regarding the roles of CaMKII and InsPaR in cardiac myocytes during ECC, arrhythmogenesis and nuclear signaling in normal, Hyp and HF cardiac myocytes."

"9401372","Human obesity represents a serious world-wide health problem. One consequence of obesity is the development of metabolic syndrome, characterized by insulin resistance and hyperglycemia, that can lead to ? cell dysfunction and type 2 diabetes. It is therefore important that we gain an understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of the development of obesity because this knowledge represents a basis for the design of potential therapeutic interventions. Recent studies have identified increased energy expenditure caused by adipose tissue thermogenesis as an important contributing factor that can limit obesity development. The sympathetic nervous system promotes adipose tissue thermogenesis by activating brown adipose tissue. The magnitude of this response can be increased by the presence of brown-like adipocytes in white adipose tissue depots. These brite/beige adipocytes are more common in sub-cutaneous adipose tissue compared with visceral adipose tissue, and their presence is strongly induced by exposure to cold. Control of beige/brite adipocytes ? for example, using pharmacological tools ? represents a potential therapeutic option for the treatment of obesity. Consequently, it is important that we gain an understanding of molecular mechanisms that contribute to adipose tissue thermogenesis. This knowledge is critical for identifying possible molecular targets that could be employed for therapeutic intervention. Significant progress has been achieved towards defining beige/brite cell development and function, including the role of signaling pathways and transcription factors. However, there are significant gaps in our knowledge. Recent studies in my laboratory have uncovered a role for alternative pre-mRNA splicing in the regulation of adipose tissue thermogenesis. We have identified widespread changes in alternative pre-mRNA splicing in white adipocytes following consumption of a high fat diet. Bioinformatic analysis identified NOVA binding sites in a large fraction of regulated adipocyte pre-mRNA splicing events. Indeed, we found that NOVA expression is regulated by diet-induced obesity in both rodents and humans. To test the role of NOVA proteins, we established Nova1LoxP/LoxP and Nova2LoxP/LoxP mice and studied the effect of NOVA-deficiency in adipocytes. We found that NOVA-deficiency caused ?browning? of white adipose depots, increased adipose tissue thermogenesis, and protection against diet-induced obesity and metabolic syndrome. These studies identify pre-mRNA splicing as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in obesity-induced metabolic syndrome. Importantly, previous studies have established pre-mRNA splicing as a pharmacologically tractable target for therapeutic intervention in diseases. The overall goal of this research program is to identify molecular mechanisms that account for the function of NOVA pre-mRNA splicing factors in adipocytes. Achievement of this goal will increase understanding of the molecular response to obesity. We anticipate that the successful completion of this research program will lead to the identification of new mechanisms that contribute to the obesity response. This knowledge may represent a basis for the design of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes."
"8107005","The goals of this project are to continue our computational and experimental investigations of HDL, focusing  on mechanisms of assembly of phospholipid (PL)-rich and cholesteryl ester (CE)-rich HDL from PL-poor  apoA-l.

To achieve these goals, we propose,  using a combination of molecular dynamics (MD) and experimental approaches, two specific aims listed in  order of priority: 1) To study the structure/dynamics of PL-rich HDL. To achieve this aim, we will: i) Perform  more robust simulations of the 100:2 and 50:2 particles, ii) Study the role of rotamer registry by varying  egistry and inhibiting buried salt bridges via MD simulations and experimentally via dimerization of Cys  mutations, iii) Determine the role of the flexible domain of full length apoA-l and the effect of unesterified  cholesterol (UC) and/or sphingomyelin (SM) via simulations and experimental studies, the role of salt bridge  ormation between lipid headgroups and apoA-l, and the mechanisms of interaction of peptide mimetics with  PL-rich HDL via simulations, iv) Image PL-rich HDL assemblies using cryoEM and low angle x-ray scattering  2) To explore the molecular basis for the assembly of PL-rich HDL from PL-poor apoA-l. To achieve this aim,  we will use: i) MD simulations of monomeric apoA-l from a recent x-ray crystal structure, and dimeric PLDoor  HDL using the particle shrinkage approach; ii) experimental approaches to: determine stoichiometry  and kinetics of assembly of PL-rich from PL-poor HDL, determine composition/stoichiometry of pre-beta (PLpoor)  HDL from plasma, and determine the structure/composition of PL-rich HDL produced by the ABCA1  pathway. Preliminary results suggest that the majority of these aims can be achieved within the 5 years of  requested support. A long-term aim for which no funds are requested is: To determine the  structure/dynamics of CE-rich HDL. Because of the extraordinary power of MD simulation to provide  supramolecular images of HDL as indicated by our preliminary results, by combining MD simulations and  experimental approaches, we are uniquely positioned to gain new insights into the structure/function of the  various HDL subspecies. As a long term goal, from the resulting dynamic structure-function maps, drugs will  be designed to modify the good cholesterol, HDL, to prevent or reverse coronary heart disease."

Structural stability of lipoproteins is essential for their functions, yet the  precise mechanism of their stabilization is unknown. Furthermore, HDL and LDL are extensively re-modeled  by plasma factors during metabolism; for example, LDL fusion in the arterial wall is a key event in early  atherosclerosis. However, the molecular mechanisms of HDL and LDL remodeling and fusion are not wellunderstood.  Our research is aimed at detailed understanding of the energetic and structural basis underlying  stability and re-modeling of HDL and LDL. Our preliminary studies of reconstituted discoidal HDL have  revealed a novel kinetic mechanism of lipoprotein stabilization; they showed that lipoprotein destabilization  and protein dissociation lead to particle fusion that involves high energy barriers. We demonstrated that a  similar fusion-based kinetic mechanism confers stability to plasma HDL and LDL, and thus provides a  universal natural strategy for lipoprotein stabilization. In the proposed work we will obtain detailed molecular  determinants for the kinetic stability of discoidal HDL. The focus will be on the role of protein size,  hydrophobicity, charge residue distribution, and lipid composition in the disks stability, with an emphasis on  apoA-1-based proteins and peptides. Discoidal HDL of controlled composition will be reconstituted and  analyzed by using an integrated spectroscopic, calorimetric, and electron microscopic approach. The kinetics  of protein-lipid association, which will be analyzed by absorption and circular dichroism spectroscopy, will  help to determine the role of the protein primary and secondary structure on the lipid binding pathway.  Molecular determinants for LDL stability and fusion will be obtained, with an emphasis on the effects of  protein and lipid oxidation, lipid composition, and apoB C-terminal truncations on the structure and stability of  plasma or reconstituted lipoproteins. The energetic and structural analysis of HDL and LDL, such as this  proposal, may lead to identification of compounds that promote or inhibit pro-atherogenic lipoprotein  transformations such as fusion, and thereby help to develop new therapies for coronary artery disease and  other lipoprotein-related disorders.

Advisory committee The Core will coordinate an annual meeting with the Internal Advisory Committee in which SCCOR progress is presented and critically reviewed. We selected an internal (versus external) committee for two main reasons: (1) the local administrative talent (Department Heads of SCCOR member Departments Cell Biology/Physiology, Genetics, Medicine, Pathology/Immunology, Pediatrics, Physics, and Radiology) are also outstanding scientists and immunologists and so are ideally suited to advise the SCCOR program; and (2) we wanted to maintain flexibility in our choice of outside advisors so that a standing committee was considered less desirable than ad hoc consultants. 3. Consultants The Core will also coordinate visits from external consultants listed in the project and core proposals. As noted above, we opted to use this mechanism for external advice (rather than an external advisory committee) to allow for flexibility in consultant selection as SCCOR research progresses. 4. Budget support The core will be responsible for management of all budgets and for monitoring expenditures for SCCOR investigators. Each investigator will receive a monthly statement detailing the financial activity of their project. Orders for supplies and equipment are placed using an on-line computer service that facilitates cost accounting. The core will also be responsible for maintaining records in response to internal and external audits of SCCOR activities. 5. Personnel support The Core will be responsible for initiating all contact with the University department for human resources and for handling issues related to employment status and job benefits. 6. Manuscript preparation The core will provide assistance in preparing manuscripts and will coordinate activities related to publication of SCCOR data.

"9316636","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is one of the leading causes of blindness in the United States and many other nations and is the leading cause of blindness in African Americans. Elevated intraocular pressure (ocular hypertension or OHT) is a major risk factor for developing POAG and the only modifiable risk factor at present. 4-7% of the United States population above age 40 has OHT. A major public health issue is how to apply the principles of patient- centered care and manage this large group of people in an effective and cost-effective manner. The OHTS carefully followed OHT participants for a median of 13 years. (OHTS Phase 1 and 2) This includes 279 participants who developed POAG during the study, the largest inception cohort of POAG patients ever described. We propose to re-examine all surviving OHTS participants at 20 years or more in 2015-2017 (OHTS Phase 3). We will determine the incidence and severity of POAG in the OHTS cohort and determine the frequency and severity of self-reported functional limitations associated with POAG. We will also develop a 20-year prediction model for stratifying OHT patients by their risk of developing POAG and, among those who developed POAG, a prediction model for the rate of visual field loss. OHTS Phase 3 will allow us to develop evidence-based, 20-year guidelines for the management of patients with OHT. This will aid patients and clinicians to make informed decisions about the appropriate frequency of examinations and tests and the benefit of early, preventative treatment. Informed decisions should improve outcomes, reduce costs and reduce patient and clinician burden."
"9388242","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein stability is an important requirement for heterologous expression, biocatalysis, and therapeutic applications. However, the discovery of stabilizing protein mutations remains a challenge in the field of protein engineering. Identifying stabilizing mutations through rational design remains difficult due to the poor understanding of how sequence relates to stability. On the other hand, directed evolution methods, while requiring little prior knowledge of structure-activity relationships, have mainly relied on using fusion reporter constructs for selection of stable proteins. These approaches are limited by factors such as protein size and interference from the fused reporter. Additionally, in many cases only stability is selected for, which can lead to unintended consequences such as loss of protein activity.       The proposed research seeks to develop a general method for rapidly evolving stable proteins while ensuring maintenance of protein activity through Phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE). PACE allows hundreds of rounds of directed evolution to be performed within the space of a week with minimal researcher intervention. By linking negative selection to activation of the E. coli heat shock response sigma factor ?32, the proposed method will use PACE to select against destabilized proteins. Protein function can be maintained by simultaneously conducting positive selection for an activity of interest. After the proposed system is validated i proof-of-concept experiments, it will be applied to evolving intrabodies capable of binding to and neutralizing mutant huntingtin misfolding and cytotoxicity."

"9460600","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Functional studies to elucidate mechanistic interactions between different bacterial species within the human microbiome are critically needed to understand their role in this microbial community. Research suggests that non-diphtheriae Corynebacterium species play a significant role in structuring healthy nasal and skin microbiota. These generally harmless commensals are implicated in affecting colonization by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, pathogens that also frequently colonize nasal/skin sites. Our data indicate that some Corynebacterium species hydrolyze analogs of human skin-surface lipids releasing free fatty acids (FFAs) with anti-pneumococcal activity. Thus, we hypothesize that Corynebacterium spp. modify their habitat by producing lipases that release FFAs with antibacterial activity from host epithelial-surface lipids and that the level of these lipid substrates impacts the composition of the skin microbiota, diminishing pathogen colonization. The overall objective of this proposal is to gain genetic and mechanistic knowledge of how commensal Corynebacterium spp. release these antibacterial FFAs from host surface lipids and to determine if altering skin lipid composition affects microbiota composition. The rationale for this study is that uncovering these mechanisms will create opportunities to identify specific strains, genes and/or Corynebacterium-produced compounds with potential for therapeutic use. We will use a combination of culture-based approaches and human samples to identify relevant genes, and the impact of their expression, in culture and on epithelial surfaces. The Specific Aims of this proposal are (1) to determine how Corynebacterium spp. release antibacterial free fatty acids from host lipids, (2) to identify and characterize the regulatory mechanisms that control activity of extracellular lipases in lipid-requiring and lipid-independent Corynebacterium spp. and (3) to determine the impact of a topically applied skin-surface-lipid analog on the microbiota of three different human skin sites (dry, moist and oily). To accomplish these, we will use a combination of genetic, biochemical and bioinformatic approaches (Aims 1 and 2), along with a 16S rRNA gene-based approach (Aim 3). The significance of this work will be to provide the foundational mechanistic information that is critically needed to identify specifc strains of Corynebacterium spp. and Corynebacterium-produced compounds with potential as alternative, non-antibiotic therapies to prevent infections by pathogens, such as S. pneumoniae and S. aureus. The three main innovations in our strategy are (1) using functional molecular studies of bacteria in coculture to elucidate the role of different bacterial species within the human microbiome, (2) choosing a system that allows for non-invasive studies directly in the human host, and (3) translating our findings to test a simple intervention on human skin surfaces. Our long-term goal is to develop new and sustainable ways to manage the composition of nasal and skin microbiota to prevent disease by excluding or controlling pathogens."
"9318518","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) constitute a small percentage of Medicare beneficiaries but account for a disproportionate amount of the money spent on Medicare. They are rehospitalized far more frequently than other persons, with 36% of patients rehospitalized within 30 days. As the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) have increasingly focused on reducing 30-day hospital readmission rates in all Medicare patients including those on dialysis, they have started penalizing hospitals for 30-day readmissions. Even though physicians are increasingly incentivized to avoid 30-day rehospitalizations, it is not known if they are preventable in patients on dialysis (or in Medicare patients as a whole) or if some rehospitalizations are potentially beneficial. The causes of 30-day readmissions in patients on dialysis have not been previously described, and to date, no one has attempted to see if some 30-day rehospitalizations might prevent future adverse events in patients. The First Aim is mostly descriptive and will identify the most common hospitalization and rehospitalization pairs of diagnoses. It will also identify diagnosis pairs that are clinically related to each other and those that are not. The Second Aim will take the most common causes of 30-day rehospitalization and identify groups of patients who are likely to be rehospitalized and those who are likely to die within 3 years, in order to risk-stratify patients b mortality and likelihood for rehospitalization. The Third Aim will take patients who are at high likelihood for death and identify groups of patients who may potentially benefit from 30-day readmission by seeing if they have better outcomes than expected. This research will help clinicians and policy makers better understand when 30-day rehospitalizations may be beneficial to patients on dialysis. It will help direct policy makers to introduce policies that taget reductions in inappropriate rehospitalizations and will help physicians understand when to consider rehospitalization as a potential therapeutic treatment."
"9381356","PROJECT SUMMARY Diseases of the biliary system are uncommon, however, collectively they comprise a significant percentage of the indications for liver transplantation in adult and pediatric populations. The pathogenesis of these disorders likely involves cellular responses to the harmful effects of bile, to which epithelial cells lining the bile ducts are continuously exposed. Bile toxicity arises largely from the oxidative damage caused by bile salts, whose detergent properties disrupt intracellular organelles, particularly mitochondria. Bile duct epithelial cells, also known as cholangiocytes, have evolved strategies for preventing bile toxicity in addition to having robust anti-oxidant defense systems, which are present in all cells to combat reactive oxygen species generated during normal metabolism. Recent work from my laboratory using the zebrafish system has identified regional susceptibilities to redox stress imparted by the biliary toxin biliatresone, which is an isoflavone recovered from Dysphania species plants responsible for outbreaks of epidemic biliary atresia (BA) in livestock. We have identified differences in the glutathione redox state in extra-hepatic and intra-hepatic cholangiocytes (EHC; IHC), and their ability to mitigate oxidative stress. This suggests that variation in cholangiocyte redox defenses may play a role in the pathogenesis of other biliary diseases. The goal of this proposal is to study the mechanisms responsible for this variation by exploiting the strengths of the zebrafish system. In aim 1, we will examine basal and stress-induced changes in glutathione metabolism in IHC and EHC. In aim 2, we will examine transcriptional mediators of basal and inducible stress responses in IHC and EHC, and determine whether they evolve from developmentally encoded differences in epigenetic regulators of gene transcription. In aim 3, we will examine the role of proteomic stress responses in redox induced biliary injury, focusing on a co- chaperone we have linked to human BA. In aim 4, we will study the differential effects in IHC and EHC of IDH gene mutations found in human bile duct cancers that have been shown to alter NADPH and glutathione metabolism in other cancers. The long term goal of these studies is to translate discoveries made in the zebrafish to humans using mammalian in vivo and cell culture models."

Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (CSMC) is one of the largest academic medical centers in the western US. Our overall objective is to use state-of-the-art approaches to develop novel strategies for phenotyping and ultimately improving the clinical care of patients with urologic chronic pelvic pain syndromes (UCPPS). The overall hypothesis of this project is that uncultivated commensal microbial communities and their interactions with the host are associated with the development of UCPPS and that the resultant protein patterns in the urine and blood create a signature diagnostic of UCPPS. We will use two complementary approaches to test this hypothesis: (1) We will employ state-of-the-art resources in microbiome genomic sequencing and characterization, some of which are unique to Cedars-Sinai, to define the microbiome/mycobiome of UCPPS patients in comparison to normal subjects, (2) We hypothesize that UCPPS is caused by the changes of some proteins at the expression and post-translational modification levels and that these changes can be rapidly identified in an unbiased manner using advanced proteomics technologies. The Specific Aims are: Aim 1. To identify disease-specific changes in bladder commensal bacterial and fungal communities by next generation sequencing of ribosomal DNA in urine from MAPP patients with UCPPS and control subjects. Aim 2: To identify clinically relevant non-invasive urinary biomarkers of UCPPS through deep proteomics analysis of urine and blood from MAPP patients.

"9297032","Two main subsets of B cells, B1 and B2, are major contributors to intestinal homeostasis, mainly through secretion of IgA. The role of IgM in the control of intestinal microbiota, however, is not understood and until now has been mostly ignored. Using a mouse model of pneumonic tularemia, we have recently shown that IgM directed against the LPS of the Gram-negative bacterium Francisella tularensis (Ft) plays a protective role in the early phase of the infection. These antibodies are rapidly produced in a IL-1?-dependent fashion by B1 B cells. Our preliminary results also show that anti-Ft LPS IgM is present in the small intestine and is cross- reactive with components of the intestinal microbiota, though not with several Gram-negative pathogens. Finally, we have evidence that lung infection with Ft causes a shift in the composition of the intestinal microbiota. Taken together, these results suggest a previously unknown mechanism through which pulmonary infections can potentially alter the composition of the intestinal microbiota. Our hypothesis is that Ft-specific IgM generated in the early phase of the infection is cross-reactive with intestinal commensals and causes a rapid shift in the composition of the microbiota. We will test this novel concept in the following specific aims. Aim1. How does Ft lung infection change the intestinal microbiota? 1A. Intestinal microbiota diversity will be examined before and after Ft lung infection, immunization with purified Ft LPS, or passive transfer of Ft- immune serum. We will determine whether the microbiota change is transitory or long lasting, and whether it depends on IL-1?. 1B. Mouse strains that lack secretory IgM, or the polymeric Ig receptor, or activation- induced cytidine deaminase (AID) will be used to test the hypothesis that IgM is necessary and sufficient for the microbiota changes associated to Ft infection/vaccination. Aim2. Which B1 B cell subset contributes to the generation of Ft-specific and microbiota-cross-reactive IgM? 2A. Adoptive transfer of B1a, B1b, marginal zone B cells, or follicular B cells into Rag1-/- mice will clarify which of these B cell subsets is responsible for production of the Ft-specific and microbiota cross-reactive IgM and whether different subsets generate each specificities. These experiments will also reveal the role of each B cells subsets in the homeostatic regulation of intestinal microbiota. 2B. Adoptive transfer of B1 cells deficient in the integrin ?4?7 will determine whether microbiota changes require homing of cells to the intestinal lamina propria. The successful completion of the proposed research will identify the role of IgM and B1 cell subsets in the regulation of gut microbial diversity and will uncover a novel mechanism through which infections may lead to dysbiosis."

"9277585","Project Summary Left truncation arises frequently in observational cohort studies, in which subjects are sampled into substudies at some time during their follow-up, but the time origin of interest occurred prior to substudy sampling. For example, in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) cumulative data set, many subjects experienced onset of cognitive impairment prior to their entry to the data set, and thus their time from impairment to Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis is left truncated by their time to NACC entry. Standard methods of risk set adjustment can be used to adjust for this delayed entry, as long as the critical assumption of quasi-independence (i.e., factorization of the joint density over the observable region) between the entry time and time to AD diagnosis holds. However, this assumption often does not hold, and the simple adjusted analyses are biased. Truncated data, unlike purely censored data, enable identification of this requisite dependence due to joint observation of both the entry (truncation) time and the event time, and formal statistical tests are available. This proposal is motivated by our team's collective and extensive engagement in neurological disease studies, which display pervasive dependent truncation, and is supported by our expertise in survival analysis. This proposal adopts a range of analytical approaches to address dependent truncation that arises through any of several possible mechanisms. We accommodate unexplained dependence through inversion of transformation models and permutation null distributions, nonparametric bounds and estimation, and semi-parametric models, covariate-induced dependence through inverse probability weighting methods, and dependence that is induced by sequential truncating events through copula models. This project will establish a significantly enhanced collection of usable and robust methods for the analysis of dependently truncated data, which will strengthen the validity of research findings from studies of major public health problems, such as Alzheimer's disease. Each of our aims involves derivation of asymptotic results, extensive simulation, and application to our motivating neurologic disease studies."
"9301311","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  An estimated 623,000 people were living with major lower limb amputation in the United States in 2005; this number will continue to grow due to population aging and increasing incidence of dysvascular disease. The emerging field of robotic leg prostheses provides exciting possibilities to enhance functional outcomes for these individuals; however, the ability to control of these devices must be improved. Pattern recognition algorithms may be used to decode data from mechanical sensors on the prosthesis to predict ambulation mode, and our preliminary data shows that incorporating neural control information by decoding patterns in electromyographic (EMG) signals improves accuracy. However, EMG signals vary with electrode position, skin/electrode impedance, or muscle fatigue, and it remains unclear how to incorporate these signals within a robust control system that is clinically viable for long-term use. Our long-term goal is to create robust, intuitive, and generalizable control systems for lower-limb prostheses. Our objective in the proposed research is to design and test an adaptive framework-that can compensate for changes in residual limb EMG signals-to control a powered knee and ankle prosthesis. Our central hypothesis, based on preliminary data, is that adaptation of a neural control system may be supervised using mechanical sensor data and a priori gait profile information to more accurately predict ambulation mode. The rationale is that EMG signals provide important neural information to the control system, and that accounting for non-stationary behavior of EMG signals over time will improve system robustness. We will test our hypothesis through the following three specific aims: (1) Develop a gait-pattern estimator to robustly label prior ambulation modes following correct or incorrect control system predictions; (2) Identify an effective method to update the pattern recognition control system for prediction of ambulation modes; and (3) Evaluate a real-time adaptive neural control system in 12 transfemoral amputees. Under Aim 1, we will develop a system that accurately estimates what mode (e.g., walking, stair climbing) the user was operating within during the previous stride. This data will be used as an 'expert' to provide a label to supervise an online adaptive control system. Under Aim 2, the improvement in control accuracy provided by supervised adaptation will be compared to that provided by unsupervised adaptation. Under Aim 3, the adaptive system will be translated to a real-time embedded system and tested by 12 transfemoral amputees. This proposal provides an innovative approach to incorporating neural control information and removes a critical barrier to using EMG signals to improve control of lower limb prostheses. The proposed research is significant because it will result in a robust control system that will allow more intuitive control of powered leg prostheses. This will in turn facilitate use of these devices and improve mobility for tens of thousands of people. This technology may also be translated to improve control of powered exoskeletons-another important emerging field of research."
"9415122","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In order to eliminate new pediatric HIV infections, save maternal lives, and simplify antiretroviral therapy (ART) implementation in settings with generalized HIV epidemics, current WHO guidance recommends lifelong triple ART for all pregnant and breastfeeding women (Option B+). However, despite the promise of Option B+ to remove logistical barriers and to promote maternal health through life-long ART, this strategy brings challenges. Key amongst these challenges is adherence to ART and continuous retention in HIV care, especially for women who do not require ART for their own health. Barriers to adherence and retention in care for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) have been identified at the individual, interpersonal, community, and health facility levels; yet specific barriers in the context of Option B+ are not well understood. Our study will b conducted at 20 health facilities and associated communities in Nyanza Province, Kenya where MTCT rates prior to Option B+ roll-out remained near 10%, despite the wide availability of PMTCT services. As Option B+ is scaled up in Kenya, it is essential to identify effective methods to ensure long-term adherence and retention in care for mother-baby pairs, throughout pregnancy, breastfeeding, and beyond. Building on our team's prior research experience in this setting, we propose to gain understanding of and address potential barriers at the individual, community, and health facility levels through formative research with HIV-positive pregnant and postpartum women, their male partners, and health care providers. This information will be used to refine two proposed interventions that are highly likely to maximize ART adherence and retention in care among HIV-infected pregnant women and HIV-exposed infants. These interventions will be rigorously tested in rural Kenya; using a cluster randomized 2x2 factorial designs. The evidence-based interventions to be tested will include 1) community Mentor Mothers (cMM) who will provide support for ART adherence and retention in care for HIV-positive women in the community and 2) individually tailored, theory- based mobile phone text messages to help retain women and infants in HIV care. Our overall goal is to determine which intervention (or combination of interventions) maximizes ART adherence and retention in care in the context of Option B+ and thus improves maternal and infant health outcomes. Our primary outcomes will include ART adherence at 12 months postpartum and retention in care, measured by a documented HIV care visit within 90 days prior to 12 months postpartum. Secondary outcomes will include MTCT at 6 weeks, 12 months and 18 months; as well as maternal viral loads and CD4 counts. Results from this study will inform the scale-up of Option B+ in Kenya by identifying effective interventions and combinations of interventions that can reduce barriers and increase facilitators of optimal ART adherence and retention in care with the aims of reaching the elimination of mother to child transmission of HIV and significantly improving maternal health."
"9357663","Project Summary A novel technique called transcranial current stimulation (TCS) creates small electrical fields in the brain through electrodes placed on the scalp. As a method for neuromodulation, TCS carries with it many practical benefits: it is portable (battery-operated), inexpensive, and easily deployable in the clinic and at home. Due to this simplicity and apparent versatility there has been an explosion in the number of studies currently underway using either direct or alternating transcranial currents (over 500 clinical trials are listed with clinicaltrials.gov). Despite this ubiquitous use of the technique in clinical and basic research, there is substantial uncertainly as to its mechanism of action, and even its basic dosage/response relationships are poorly understood. This project will use intracranial recordings in the primary visual cortex of nonhuman primates to understand how TCS changes neural activity. The first aim is to understand the parameters (e.g. current strength, electrode montage, duration) that affect the ability of direct currents to modulate neural excitability (tDCS). The second aim is to understand the parameters that affect the neuromodulatory efficacy of transcranial random noise currents (tRNS). The third aim is to understand the parameters that affect the efficacy of alternating currents (tACS)."
"9329207","Project summary The overall scientific goal of this proposal is to build upon our findings in MUC5B-associated idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) to understand the basic mechanisms of pulmonary fibrosis. IPF is a devastating disease that claims 5 million lives worldwide annually. It is characterized by progressive lung fibrosis and formation of microscopic honeycomb (HC) cysts. Although some therapies have recently become available, treatment of IPF is limited by our understanding of its pathobiology. We have found that a gain-of-function polymorphism 3kb upstream of the MUC5B gene is the strongest risk factor for development of IPF. In preliminary experiments in mice, we demonstrate that overexpression of Muc5b leads to an enhancement of fibrosis provoked by bleomycin and influenza. However, overexpression of Muc5b without lung injury is not sufficient to provoke fibrosis. Gene expression analysis in IPF has demonstrated an association of MUC5B expression with HC. Likewise, we and others, have discovered that HCs contain significant MUC5B protein. A recent publication noted that mice develop HC-like cysts in the setting of influenza injury, and that cyst formation depends on the Notch developmental pathway. Notch signals have also been demonstrated to be important for HC formation in IPF. We have found that influenza-associated HC-like cysts in mice contain copious Muc5b, and in human lung epithelial cell lines Notch inhibition significantly reduces MUC5B expression. However, the interplay of NOTCH and MUC5B in IPF are completely unknown. Given the apparent role of Notch in the expression of Muc5b and HC-like cysts, and the characterized role of Muc5b in human and murine fibrosis models, we hypothesized that Notch modulates lung injury repair and promotes pulmonary fibrosis through downstream Muc5b expression. In Aim 1 of this proposal, I will establish a role for Notch in pulmonary fibrosis and Muc5b expression by testing whether Notch is necessary or sufficient for either. In Aim 2, I will evaluate the necessity of Muc5b in fibrosis, and determine whether effects of Muc5b on fibrosis are epithelial-cell intrinsic. These Aims address significant gaps in our knowledge of IPF pathogenesis, particularly where epithelia are concerned, and may lead to novel therapies. Training received during this novel project will enhance my understanding of molecular biology, and, paired with specific coursework in bioinformatics, will enable me to focus on functional genetic approaches to interstitial lung disease."
"9333067","Project Summary  Glioblastoma (GBM) is a uniformly lethal cancer with an overall survival of less than 15 months, despite aggressive standard of care therapies. In contrast to such therapies, which are limited by their lack of specificity and resultant toxicities, immunotherapy provides an exquisitely precise approach for safe and effective tumor treatment. A peptide vaccine derived from the glioma-associated antigen cytomegalovirus (CMV) phosphoprotein 65 (pp65) is a promising strategy for inducing potent cytotoxic glioma-specific immune responses. The broad success of this approach, however, is limited by the ability to overcome glioma-mediated immune deficiencies and T cell inhibitory pathways to promote robust T cell activation. Such limitations can be addressed through the combined use of immunomodulatory adjuvants to improve the setting in which T cells recognize and respond to glioma antigens.  Celldex Therapeutics has developed a clinically-relevant high-affinity human anti-human CD27 immunomodulatory antibody (CDX1127) that induces potent antitumor T cell responses through engagement of the CD27 T cell costimulatory pathway. This antibody is efficacious as a monotherapy in preclinical tumor models and has given rise to significant clinical responses in early phase trials.  Given the preliminary success of monotherapy CDX1127 in inducing endogenous antitumor immunity, the overall goal of this proposal is to develop a CMV-pp65 peptide vaccine platform that employs CDX1127 as a vaccine adjuvant. Our preliminary data in human CD27 transgenic mice show that CDX1127 enhances the vaccine-induced immune response to a model tumor antigen and is efficacious against intracranial tumors. Interestingly, this adjuvant effect occurs to a greater degree in the setting of a whole protein vaccine compared to a minimal peptide epitope vaccine, suggesting that the vaccine composition considerably influences the immunomodulatory activity of CDX1127. To progress the clinical translation of CDX1127 as a vaccine adjuvant, our proposed studies will elucidate the mechanism by which CDX1127 most effectively enhances the vaccine-induced immune response, further informing design of our CMV-pp65 peptide immunotherapy.  Our overall goal is to further my training as a biomedical scientist pursuing a career in translational immunotherapy while advancing the CMV-pp65 peptide vaccine platform for patients with GBM. The completion of these aims will cultivate a strong foundation in tumor immunology and T cell biology, as well as exposure to the complex process of translating an experimental therapy to the clinic."
"9512029","Our laboratory?s long-range goal is to understand how HIV-1 persists despite optimal antiretroviral therapy and to develop new approaches to clear the infection. Virus isolated from patient blood encodes vpr, which is packaged into virions and expressed at late stages of viral infection. Vpr is needed for optimal infection of macrophages, tonsillar tissue and SIV model systems, however its actions in T cells are largely detrimental to infection and a requirement for Vpr for HIV infection is not observed in pure T cell systems. There is currently a critical gap in our understanding of why Vpr is conserved in the virus despite its unique role in macrophages, which are not known to be crucial for HIV transmission or persistence. Our preliminary data strongly indicate that Vpr is responsible for downmodulation of a macrophage-specific protein that interferes with Env expression. Thus, the objectives of this application are (1) to determine the extent to which Vpr-mediated downmodulation of the macrophage protein alleviates restriction of Env and spread of HIV in macrophages, (2) to determine the domain of Env required for restriction in macrophages and (3) to identify viral populations from in vivo samples that manifest these phenotypes. Our central hypothesis is that a macrophage protein binds residues on Env and targets it to degradative and/or antigen presentation compartments to restrict spread and enhance antigen presentation in infected and bystander myeloid cells; Vpr counteracts this pathway by reducing levels of the restricting protein through direct infection and fusion of Vpr-containing virions with bystander myeloid cells. The rationale for the proposed work is that a greater understanding of how HIV overcomes cellular antiviral mechanisms to establish a persistent infection in macrophages will facilitate efforts to clear infection in the CNS and other reservoirs. Thus, we plan to test our central hypothesis and accomplish the objective of this application by pursuing the following specific aims: 1. Determine the extent to which the macrophage protein we have identified accounts for restriction of Env in HIV infected macrophages lacking Vpr. 2. Define the domain of Env proteins needed for susceptibility to restriction by macrophages. 3. Identify viral populations from in vivo samples that target the restriction factor. At the completion of these studies we expect to determine the extent to which; (1) macrophages restrict viral infection by targeting a specific domain on Env, (2) sensitivity to this restriction is an important characteristic of viruses that form reservoirs in people, (3) Vpr functions to counteract this restriction by downmodulating the macrophage protein. An understanding of the macrophage restriction factor and identification of Env domains responsible for sensitivity to the restriction may provide new approaches to limit spread of HIV and enhance the immune response by promoting antigen presentation. Targeting the mechanisms by which the virus disrupts the immune system may allow the development of safer, more specific treatment approaches that will promote the clearance of HIV-1 infected cells."
"9314580","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests a renewal of funding for the Mexican Migration Project to gather and disseminate high quality data on documented and undocumented Mexican migration to the United States. The MMP has been in the field since 1982 and from 1987 onward has received continuous funding from NICHD. The database has become a mainstay for research on Mexican migration to the United States and a model for similar data collection efforts in China, Poland, Ukraine, West Africa, Morocco, Bangladesh, and elsewhere in Latin America, yielding a growing body of data collected using comparable methods and instruments (see Massey and Capoferro 2004).  The MMP initially focused on west-central Mexico-the states of Guanajuato, Jalisco, Michoacán, San Luís Potosí, and Zacatecas. These states have consistently accounted for at least half of all migrants to the United States and represent the historical heartland for U.S.-bound migration. During the 1990s, however, new migration sources emerged in response to structural changes in the Mexican political economy and MMP investigators expanded data collection geographically to include new sending regions throughout the country, eventually compiling samples from 24 of Mexico's 32 states. Together these states account for almost 90% of all undocumented migrants who registered for Mexico's consular ID card (Massey, Rugh, and Pren 2010).  At this point, the most serious geographic omission in the MMP database is Mexico's Federal District, which accounts for around 7% of all undocumented migrants who registered for the consular ID card. In the coming period this gap will be filled by surveying neighborhoods in Mexico City. Given recent declines in the likelihood of undocumented departure and the rising frequency of circulation in legal status, we also propose to survey new communities in west-central Mexico, as this region offers the longest history of migration and the largest stock of migratory experience to assess the nature and reasons for trends over time. At the same time, we also will continue to conduct surveys in new origin areas located in Mexico's central region. We also propose to use an innovative new approach to improve coverage of the large population of undocumented migrants living in the United States and will add new questions to the survey instrument to assess the effect of violence on migration to the United States, and also to phase in a new team of investigators capable of leading the project into the future."
"9367266","Project Summary/Abstract Aggressive care in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) has been shown to impair the quality of life of patients with advanced cancer and increase the risk of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) among the family and friends who serve as informal caregivers. Because a majority of cancer patients in the ICU are unable to communicate, caregivers must often serve as the patient's surrogate and make life-and-death decisions on the patient's behalf while experiencing intense grief and extreme distress. Unfortunately, recent data found that palliative care interventions in the ICU increased, rather than decreased, the caregiver's risk of PTSD at 3- month follow-up. Thus, there is a pressing need for an intervention to assist caregivers in coping with this extremely stressful and potentially psychologically traumatic situation. We propose here to develop further and pilot test a brief mental health intervention called ?Enhancing & Mobilizing the POtential for Wellness & Emotional Resilience of Caregivers of ICU Cancer Patients? (EMPOWER). EMPOWER is a cognitive- behavioral, acceptance-based intervention delivered by a trained social worker to informal caregivers in the ICU. Because it is delivered in the ICU, caregiver concerns about leaving the patient are minimized. EMPOWER uses discrete ~15-minute modules that can be delivered flexibly to a vulnerable set of caregivers and can accommodate multiple interruptions and unexpected crises. The EMPOWER intervention targets caregiver symptoms of ?peritraumatic stress? (e.g., feeling in shock) and anticipatory grief (e.g., separation distress evoked by the patient's impending death) to reduce ?experiential avoidance? (i.e., avoidance of unpleasant thoughts and feelings). Reducing this type of avoidant behavior removes a substantial barrier to appropriate advance care planning for the patient. To refine and pilot EMPOWER, this application seeks to: 1) obtain feedback on EMPOWER from key informants using the Delphi Method; 2) determine the feasibility, tolerability, acceptability, and preliminary effects of EMPOWER on caregiver PTSD symptom severity 3 months from baseline; and 3) determine preliminary effects of EMPOWER on patient outcomes (e.g., intensity of care, quality of life/death) 1 month from baseline. These 3 aims will be accomplished in 2 phases. In Phase 1, bereaved ICU cancer patient caregivers (n=12) and ICU clinicians (n=12) will critique EMPOWER Version 1.0 to inform improvements. In Phase 2, 60 caregivers of critically ill and uncommunicative ICU cancer patients will be randomized to either EMPOWER Version 2.0 (n=30) or usual care (n=30). EMPOWER is expected to: a) reduce experiential avoidance; b) increase rates of advance care planning; c) reduce intensity of patient care/increase palliative care; d) improve patient quality of life/death; and e) reduce severity of caregivers' PTSD symptoms. Hitting any of these targets alone is expected to significantly improve cancer patient and caregiver outcomes; hitting more than one would be a boon to public health."
"9400748","PROJECT SUMMARY Obesity-induced inflammation is a well-established mechanistic link between obesity and diabetes. Adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) lie at the center of the adipose tissue immune network. Many knowledge gaps exist regarding ATM biology and its relationship to human metabolic disease. The mechanisms of ATM accumulation, how their activation state relates to type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), and how they communicate with preadipocytes and adipocytes to regulate nutrient storage are incompletely understood. The goal of this proposal is to address these knowledge gaps using complementary studies in human adipose tissue samples and mouse models. The scientific premise for the hypotheses in this project is rooted in the observation from our groups that visceral adipose tissue from obese (DM) subjects have higher CD206+ ATMs, fewer preadipocytes, larger adipocytes, and manifest adipocyte metabolic dysfunction compared to obese non-DM subjects. We propose a model whereby the expansion of CD206+ ATMs by in situ proliferation blocks preadipocyte proliferation and differentiation to generate a dysfunctional adipose tissue environment. We will evaluate CSF1 as a putative activator of CD206+ ATMs in humans and evaluate the function of CCL18 as a CD206+ ATM secreted chemokine that mediates ATM-preadipocyte communication. If completed our proposal will significantly advance our understanding of how human metabolic inflammation develops independent of obesity and lead to substantial revisions in the current models of ATM function. To evaluate our model, we propose to complete three specific aims: 1) To define mechanisms of CD206+ hATM proliferation and its relationship to adipocyte hypertrophy and DM status. 2) To identify mechanisms underlying CD206+ ATM-preadipocyte crosstalk and resultant preadipocyte and adipocyte metabolic dysfunction. 3) To evaluate the role of ATM-derived CCL18 in the regulation of adipose tissue inflammation and metabolism. The experimental approach for all aims utilize tissue samples from a large bariatric surgery cohort with diversity in age and sex, and assays of inflammatory and metabolic function. This study will accomplish its goals using a team science approach between surgeons and basic scientists to close the gap between our understanding of metainflammation in human and murine models. If completed our study can impact health by identifying new biomarkers for DM risk independent of obesity and new pathways for therapeutic interventions."
"8106505","The Molecular Biology Core Laboratory is directed by Dr. Russell. He will be assisted in day-to-day operations by Dr. Jonathan Cohen, who is an expert in high-throughput DMA sequencing. This Core laboratory provides support for acrylamide gel electrophoresis of proteins, DMA sequencing, analysis of gene expression by oligonucleotide microarray hybridization and real-time polymerase chain reactions (PCRs), oligonucleotide procurement, genomic DMA and RNA isolation, and the maintenance and storage of bacterial strains, plasmids, and purified proteins used within this Program Project. Four experienced technicians, Kevin Anderson (100% time), Emily Brown (100%), Jeffrey Cormier (100%), and Scott Clark (25%) will perform the duties associated with this Core. The laboratory facility is located within the Department of Molecular Genetics.  For the analysis of proteins, 30 vertical electrophoresis units and 12 multi-outlet power supplies are available. SDS polyacrylamide gels are either prepared (25% of gels) or purchased pre-poured (75% of gels) and run by a single technician (Emily Brown). Following electrophoresis, individual Investigators working on the different Research Projects process the gels for autoradiography, immunoblotting, or protein sequencing. A darkroom that contains a Konica automatic X-ray developer is used to process all autoradiograms and chemilumigrams. The services of the facility are used extensively to assess protein purification, immunoprecipitation from cells, expression of recombinant proteins, and immunoblotting from cultured cells, tissues, and recombinant hosts. These techniques and methods are crucial to our studies on the expression and purification of essentially all genes and proteins with which we work. In addition, the determination of tissue-specific expression patterns of genes under study via immunoblotting in transgenic and knockout mice is heavily dependent on this aspect of the Core. As summarized in Table 1 of the Program Introduction, DMA sequencing was used to analyze the cDNA and gene structures of a large number of normal and mutant DNAs that were cloned for the first time by investigators working on this Program Project Grant (see pages 162-163). Through 2003, all of our DMA sequencing was performed on-site by personnel in the Molecular Biology Core; however, in that year, a large institution-wide DNA sequencing core facility was opened at UT Southwestern. Because of the large volume of sequencing done by this facility, their costs ($5 per sequencing reaction) were lower than ours, and we switched to using their services. At the present time, DNA samples to be sequenced (plasmids, cloned genomic DMAs, and PCR products) are prepared by individual Investigators using rigidly standardized purification protocols and given to Mr. Cormier, who then personally delivers the samples once per day to the sequencing facility. DNA sequence data are returned to Mr. Cormier electronically and thereafter dispensed to Investigators in the Program Project. The turnaround time required to sequence a given DNA sample by the facility is generally less than 24 hours, and the accuracy of the sequence data provided is very high. High-throughput sequencing of human genomic DNA for Research Project 4 is budgeted separately (see Research Project 4).  A significant aspect of our research in transgenic and knockout mice involves determining how the presence of a transgene or the loss of an endogenous gene alters the expression of other genes. To this end, the Molecular Biology Core performs large numbers of microarray experiments using chips from Affymetrix that are estimated to contain 34,000 gene sequences. In a typical experiment, total RNA is prepared from one or more tissues of isogenic age- and sex-matched wild type and knockout mice by Scott Clark, and the quality of the preparation is assessed by reverse transcription and agarose gel electrophoresis. If the RNA is judged intact, Mr. Anderson prepares complementary RNA probes labeled with biotin from each sample and hybridizes them to individual chips. After washing, each chip is scanned and variations in the hybridization signal intensity are determined and compared between chips to derive a readout of differential gene expression. This data is returned to individual Investigators of the Program Project via electronic mail in a spreadsheet format, which can be manipulated to display gene products that are increased or decreased in level in the two starting RNA populations. We have a contract with Affymetrix that provides access to a large number of chips at a cost of $435 each. An on-campus core facility charges us $90 per hybridization reaction to measure signal intensity on hybridized chips. A second gene expression service provided by the Molecular Biology Core involves quantitation of single mRNAs by real-time PCR. For a given target mRNA, Mr. Jeffrey Cormier first designs four pairs of oligonucleotide primers using software (Primer Express¿) provided by Applied Biosystems. The efficiency with which each primer pair amplifies the target mRNA is determined and those pairs that match the efficiency of primers used to amplify internal standard mRNAs (cyclophilin, [5-actin, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, 36-B4 ribosomal protein) are chosen for future use. We currently have a collection of over 500 primer pairs corresponding to mRNAs that encode proteins involved in lipid metabolism. To measure gene expression, a Program Project Investigator indicates to Mr. Cormier which mRNAs he/she wishes to measure and provides him with total RNA samples extracted from the tissues of transgenic, knockout, or control mice. Mr. Cormier then converts the RNA into cDNA by reverse transcription and uses a Beckman Biomek 2000 robot to set up triplicate real-time PCR reactions in 384-well microtiter plates for each mRNA in the RNA samples. Multiple plates are then analyzed sequentially on an Applied Biosystems Model 7900HT real-time PCR machine. Each plate is subjected to a 1.7 hour thermocycler routine during which data are collected continuously from the amplification reactions. The machine has a robotic arm that automatically inserts and removes microtiter plates at the beginning and end of the thermocycler routine, allowing us to perform real-time PCR on a 24-hour basis. The capacity of this system is large, and last year we performed -300,000 real-time PCR reactions, which makes this machine and service the most heavily requested in the Molecular Biology Core. In a relatively few instances, real-time PCR is also used to genotype transgenic mice.  Custom oligonucleotides are purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Our current rate of oligonucleotide purchase is approximately 5000 per year, a number that allows us to negotiate an excellent price for this service (23 cents/base for unpurified oligonucleotides, 25 nanomole amounts). The average length of each primer is 25 bases, and approximately 80% of primers are used as obtained (without further purification) and -20% after purification by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis by the company. An occasional oligonucleotide primer is purified in our laboratories by preparative acrylamide gel electrophoresis and Sep-Pak Ci8 chromatography prior to use. Large numbers of oligonucleotide primers are used for PCR, DNA sequencing, primer extension, genetic engineering, mutagenesis, genetic mapping, and DNA binding and hybridization experiments by all investigators on this Program Project. Preparation of genomic DNA from cells, tissues, mouse tails, and blood samples is carried out by Mr. Kevin Anderson using proteinase K and specialized buffers from Viagen Biotech (Los Angeles, CA). We have used these kits for three years and have found that the yields of DNA are about 2-fold higher, that the time of preparation is short, that the method is safer, and that the quality of genomic DNA prepared is better than that isolated by other extraction methods or kits. The isolation of genomic DNA has proven especially useful in recent years in our genetic studies in which large multigenerational pedigrees (both human and mouse) are analyzed. In general, a given sample, whether obtained from cells, tissue, or blood, is ready for restriction enzyme digestion or amplification within 16 hours of receipt. Additional DNA extraction kits are used in specialized cases, such as when small amounts of sample are available or when DNA must be isolated from fixed specimens obtained from pathology. Because of the large number of bacterial strains, plasmids, and purified proteins that are used in our experiments, it is necessary to have a central facility to catalogue and store these materials. Once a cloned DNA is isolated and characterized, a sample of the bacterial strain harboring the plasmid is stored in multiple aliquots at -70¿C in medium with glycerol. At the same time, the description of the plasmid is entered into a central data base. In this manner, each new isolate or different construction that is utilized in our studies is made available to others when needed. In addition to the individual clones that are stored, aliquots of cDNA and genomic libraries that have been prepared in the course of our experiments are also maintained. Purified proteins are treated similarly and stored in small aliquots in a large dedicated -70¿C freezer.  Organized maintenance of bacterial strains and libraries is also necessary to meet the frequent requests that we receive for these materials from other investigators. We have mailed out a voluminous number of aliquots of different cDNAs, genes, and specialized plasmid constructs to laboratories throughout the world. In addition to these clones, we have provided samples of cDNA libraries to other investigators as detailed in the Appendix, Vol. ill. The volume of these requests and the general recipient satisfaction (virtually no repeat requests) testify to the need and accuracy of this vital service and archive facility. Many of the most commonly requested cDNA clones have been deposited in the ATCC collection for general distribution to the biomedical and pharmaceutical community (see Appendix, Vol. III). Specific Interactions between the Molecular Biology Core and Research Projects 1-6. All 6 Research Projects are dependent on this Core for providing support for recombinant DMA procedures, DNA sequencing, quantitative real-time PCR, and SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis."
"9209431","Project Summary (Project 2) The overarching goal of this project is to study key features of epigenetic circuitry in MM, with the objective of improving our understanding of global gene regulation in this cancer, and with the goal of deploying novel therapeutics that target key epigenomic circuits in MM as dependencies. Cells and cell states can be defined by their gene expression programs, and tumor cells commonly have deregulated gene expression programs. The production of a gene expression program is accomplished by the cell?s epigenetic apparatus. It is now possible, for any normal or cancer cell type, to identify the master transcription factors, the enhancer elements they occupy, and the genes they regulate, and thus to develop a testable model of this genome-wide epigenetic circuitry. Furthermore, it is possible to identify the gene regulatory elements on which the cell is most dependent, and thus identify the portions of the circuitry on which a cancer cell is most dependent. Tumor cells tend to develop striking dependencies on super-enhancer regulatory elements (3-6). Recent studies suggest that the transcriptional cofactors BRD4, CDK7 and CDK12 play especially important roles in tumor cell epigenetic circuitry, and their inhibition with small molecules can cause a loss of super-enhancer domains that drive genes with prominent roles in tumorigenesis (3-6). We propose to decipher the key features of MM epigenetic circuitry, to identify the features that confer great dependency, and to investigate the potential of small molecule inhibitors to disrupt those dependencies in MM. To accomplish these goals, the specific aims of the proposal are 1) To discover key features of epigenomic circuitry in multiple myeloma by integrated epigenomic analysis, 2) to determine epigenetic dependencies in multiple myeloma using gene editing approaches, and 3) to explore the ability of small molecule inhibitors of transcriptional cofactors to disrupt key nodes in multiple myeloma epigenetic circuitry."

"9312146","PROJECT SUMMARY Recent technological advances have initiated a booming new field of biosensors, wearable devices, and smartphone apps for monitoring physiological responses, movement patterns, step counts, caloric expenditure, dietary intake calorie counts, and personal health information. Usage of these tools ? in many cases for goal- setting (e.g., ?10,000 steps per day?) ? is growing at a rapid pace among children and adults of all ages. In parallel, there is an ever-heightening interest in applying these technologies to biomedical research. A particularly attractive research application for medical rehabilitation researchers is the potential for more rigorous home-based or community-based interventional research; enabling the collection of physiological or other useful data with relative ease. Such technologies would empower researchers conducting T2-T3 research, and provide underserved persons with disabilities or chronic conditions more opportunities to participate in clinical trials or other home-based interventional studies. However, a major problem facing the medical rehabilitation field is a lack of validity and reliability testing of these devices. Therefore, the central goal of the Techniques Development Component (Tech-C) of the P2C National Resource Center for High- Impact Clinical Trials in Medical Rehabilitation is to fill a major gap in the field that will catalyze more rigorous, home-based medical rehabilitation clinical trials. We will achieve this goal by providing a HITC Validation Laboratory to the national community of medical rehabilitation researchers to evaluate the validity and reliability of novel and existing tools and technology used for remote data collection in clinical trials. Building on our own experiences, the HITC Validation Laboratory will provide the resources and expertise to assist researchers in their pursuit of useful, home-based monitoring and intervention technologies. Our central goal will be achieved via the following specific aims: Aim 1. We will conduct a nationwide needs assessment in collaboration with the CCIT and Promo-C. Aim 2. By surveying the national user base of medical rehabilitation researchers (again in collaboration with the CCIT and Promo-C), we will work with investigators to obtain currently available, de-identified datasets for analysis, and to help guide (via consultative services in collaboration with Collab-C) the development of short-term, multi-site pilot studies that would generate new datasets for validation by the HITC Validation Laboratory. Aim 3. In collaboration with industry partners, other P2C resource centers, and investigators across the national HITC user base, we will conduct in-house validation studies of the most common, commercially available wearable and biosensor devices. By achieving these aims, the HITC Validation Laboratory will meet a significant and growing need for the medical rehabilitation research community.  "
"9325539","The Berkeley/Stanford Children's Environmental Health will investigate the role of air pollution in children's  health, in particular, effects on birth outcomes, birth defects, asthma, obesity, and the immune system.  Sonoma Technology Inc.'s (STI) role in the study will be to perform exposure assessment as part of the  Center's Exposure Core. We will collect ambient polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and black carbon air  pollution data in Fresno and developed refined estimates of the subject's exposure for various time periods  of their lives through data analysis and modeling. STI's work consists of four main tasks: characterize  historical air quality in the SJV; collect PAH and black carbon data at existing stations in Fresno; conduct  saturation sampling campaigns; and conduct exposure data management, analysis, and modeling  All exposure data from the study will be quality assured and compiled into a common database for use by all  investigators. The historical and current air quality data will be used to assign historical exposures for  relevant time periods in the subjects lives. The current air quality and meteorological data will be used with  dispersion model estimates and traffic, land-use, geophysical, and demographic data to develop  spatiotemporal models of daily PAH concentrations. The development of spatiotemporal models will be  conducted jointly with UCB staff. In addition, where sufficient data justify the approach, STI will apply microenvironmental  modeling techniques to estimate the personal exposure levels of subjects in the study. STI  will document our methods and results, and work with UCB staff on the preparation of project specific papers  and interpretation of scientific results. Fred Lurmann, the STI PI, will participate in regular Exposure Core  and Center meetings."
"9530878","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)  The University of Pennsylvania Superfund Research and Training Program Center (Penn SRP Center) evolved as a direct consequence of concerns from the community living proximal to the BioRit Asbestos Superfund site in Ambler, PA. The community at Ambler has actively participated in the design of projects to be tackled by the Center. As a result, the Center will consist of two Environmental Science Projects and four Biomedical Science Research Projects, which will be underpinned by one Research Core and four Service Cores. These Projects and Cores will explore various aspects of asbestos fate, exposure, remediation, and adverse health effects. Environmental Science Projects 1 and 2 are entitled Remediation of Asbestos Particles and Mobility and Fate of Asbestos Particles, respectively. Biomedical Science Projects 3-6 are entitled Social Determinants of Risk And Attitudes about Asbestos in a Superfund Environmental Justice Community, Animal Models of Mesothelioma, Chemoprevention of Asbestos-Induced Lung Diseases, and Biomarkers of Asbestos Exposure The Cores comprise an Administrative Core (Core A), the Community Engagement Core (Core B), the Research Translation Core (Core C), the Biostatistical Research Support Core (Core D), and the Interdisciplinary Training Core (Core E). The goals of the Penn SRP Center will be accomplished through the leadership of two senior highly accomplished investigators, Dr. Ian A. Blair (Director) and Dr. Trevor M. Penning (Deputy Director). The Penn SRP is underpinned by four highly significant entities. First, the Penn Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET) provides an academic home, with enormous resources to draw upon. Second, the CEET Translational Biomarker Core provides instrumentation and resources for conducting sophisticated biomarker discovery and validation studies. Third, the CEET Integrative Health Sciences Facility Core will provide support for human subject study design and storage of annotated biospecimens. Fourth, the existing CEET Certificate Program and T32 Training Program in Environmental Health Sciences provide a resource of potential students and postdoctoral fellows who could be recruited into the Penn SRP Center. Advanced techniques for the detection, assessment, and evaluation of the effect on human health of hazardous substances will involve the development of a new animal model of asbestos-induced mesothelioma. Methods to assess the risks to human health presented by hazardous substances will involve novel metabolomics methodology using high resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry will be developed to identify human populations that are exposed to asbestos. Methods and technologies to detect hazardous substances in the environment will involve two quite separate approaches. One will involve the use of earth science-based methodology to monitor the movement of asbestos within dump sites and the other will involve a sociological study to identify how asbestos exposure can occur and whether this can explain the cluster of asbestos-induced mesotheliomas in Ambler. A basic biological method to be employed for reducing the amount and toxicity of a hazardous substance will involve the remediation of asbestos by mycorrhizal fungi-mediated conversion it to a non-toxic molecular form. Therefore, although these projects evolved in response to the Ambler community's concerns (EPA Region 3), the results can be readily translated to the fifteen other asbestos sites that are present in five of the other EPA Regions (2, 5, and 8-10)."
"9236359","Treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) and other lung infections in pediatric cystic fibrosis (CF) patients currently relies on adult aerosol delivery devices, and effective dry powder inhaler platforms are not available for patients under 6 years of age. While treatment with inhaled antibiotics is considered safe and effective, CF patients continue to progress to chronic infections and the time burden of treatment is high, especially with the use of nebulized solutions in children under 6 years of age.  This project will develop a new inhalable dry powder tobramycin formulation and delivery device combination intended for pediatric patients in the age range of 2-10 years that seeks to lower the inhaled powder burden to a single capsule delivered with high efficiency. For effective and targeted lung delivery, an excipient enhanced growth (EEG) approach will be implemented where combination submicrometer particles of tobramycin and mannitol (MN) are formed by spray drying. The initially small size of the aerosol allows for effective deep lung delivery, even in diseased lungs, and the inclusion of MN as the hygroscopic excipient results in aerosol size increase within the lungs and targeted deposition. A simple active dry powder inhaler (DPI) system will be developed that implements new three-dimensional (3D) rod array technology, which has previously been shown to effectively deaggregate carrier-free powders at low flows required for pediatric applications. The initial particle size and hygroscopic excipient content will be designed to produce controlled aerosol size increase and deposition, thereby providing a uniform concentration of tobramycin in airway surface liquid. To develop this new approach, three Specific Aims are proposed: Specific Aim 1: Develop an inhaled tobramycin excipient enhanced growth (TOB-EEG) formulation that is stable and provides high dispersion when coupled with an inline dry powder inhaler (DPI) system. Specific Aim 2: Apply a concurrent computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and in vitro approach to develop and optimize a high-efficiency and high-dose active DPI system for pediatric CF patients across a range of ages. Specific Aim 3: Predict and optimize regional lung delivery concentrations of tobramycin in lung airway surface liquid using CFD, and evaluate the effects of tobramycin and excipient concentrations on in vitro sputum penetration and antimicrobial activity. This newly proposed TOB-EEG inhalation therapy will allow for efficient DPI use in pediatric patients < 6 years old for the first time. Development of a convenient DPI platform will improve patient compliance and help to promote early eradication therapy of newly identified Pa infections. The newly developed TOB-EEG formulation will significantly increase aerosol delivery to the small airways, provide significantly more uniform antibiotic concentration throughout the airways, and improve penetration of the antibiotic through the mucus to improve bacterial eradication."
"9396613","Project Summary Failure in predictive coding is an influential hypothesis regarding the neural mechanisms of schizophrenia that may account for cardinal symptoms of the disorder. Specifically, it has been hypothesized that all self-generated actions produce an efference copy, or a copy of the motor command, which results in a sensory corollary discharge, or a neural representation of the expected sensory consequences of that action, and that through this neural mechanism of predictive coding actions are classified at the neural level as originating from the self. This has been proposed to occur for internal processes as well, such that thoughts would also generate an efference copy and a corollary discharge. If a thought or action lacked this neural signature of self-generation, then delusions of control or hallucinations could arise to account for these seemingly external experiences. However, the precise neural mechanisms of this parsimonious and theoretically compelling hypothesis have yet to be elucidated. It may be informative to consider an analogous mechanism in the domain of motor control, wherein an efference copy is similarly generated in response to an action, but is then hypothesized to travel to the cerebellum, where an internal model simulates the dynamics of movement and outputs a corollary discharge (still the predicted sensory consequences), but for the purpose of motor control rather than predictive coding. Given the accumulating evidence of cerebellar dysfunction in schizophrenia and the striking similarities between these two mechanisms, the proposed research will examine whether the cerebellum is involved in predictive coding and whether cerebellar abnormalities contribute to predictive coding dysfunction in schizophrenia. The relationship of cerebellar integrity to measures of predictive coding will be assessed in controls and individuals with schizophrenia. Behavioral measures (postural sway and subsecond paced finger tapping) and a structural measure (anatomical MRI) of cerebellar integrity will be administered to 30 individuals with schizophrenia and 30 non-psychiatric controls. Previously established electrophysiological measures of the efference copy and corollary discharge will be quantified in EEG data in response to self-paced button presses; the effect of cerebellar abnormalities on the relationship between the strength of the efference copy and the corollary discharge will be assessed. Next, controls will undergo simultaneous EEG and cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation to modulate cerebellar neuronal excitability, and the effect on corollary discharge strength will be assessed. Results will reveal whether cerebellar abnormalities contribute to predictive coding dysfunction in schizophrenia, as well as whether modulation of cerebellar neuronal excitability impacts predictive coding in controls. Public health implications include better elucidating pathophysiological mechanisms of schizophrenia and gaining a more precise understanding of the role of the cerebellum in predictive coding."
"9306062","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease caused by the T cell-mediated destruction of the insulin-producing ? cells in the pancreatic islets. Several T1D-associated class I MHCs have been identified, including HLA-A*0201, expressed by many T1D patients; ? cell epitopes restricted to this MHC have been identified as well. We hypothesize that these ? cell epitopes may be utilized as part of immunomodulatory therapies to prevent the onset of T1D. This may be done by utilizing the dendritic cell (DC) endocytic receptorDEC-205. In the absence of adjuvant, epitopes delivered via DEC-205 are presented to T cells in a tolerogenic manner, resulting in T cell tolerance towards those epitopes. Our laboratory has shown that when murine ? cell epitopes linked to anti-murine DEC-205 are delivered to DCs in vivo, T cells specific for those epitopes are deleted in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. We will further these studies in humanized mouse models. Importantly, while only a subset of murine DCs expresses DEC-205, it is present on all human myeloid DCs; our model replicates the human case via expression of human DEC-205 on all murine myeloid DCs. We hypothesize that, as with anti-murine DEC-205 treatments, the delivery of murine ? cell epitopes via antibodies against human DEC-205 will also induce T cell tolerance. Previous studies have also shown that simultaneous delivery of several HLA-A*0201-restricted ? cell epitopes, chemically linked to splenocytes, to HLA-A*0201-transgenic NOD mice prevented the onset of diabetes. To develop more clinically relevant reagents, we will simultaneously deliver these epitopes to NOD mice transgenic for both human DEC-205 and HLA-A*0201; we expect the induction of T cell tolerance towards these epitopes and prevention of T1D. This has the potential to aid the many T1D patients who express HLA-A*0201. However, HLA-A*0201 is not expressed by all T1Dpatients. To develop treatments for these patients, other T1D-associated class I MHCs should be considered, including the early onset-associated HLA-B*3906. While HLA-B*3906 is itself a rare allele, we have shown it to be a member of the HLA-B27 super type, whose members are expressed by 28% of the population. Studying HLA-B*3906 has the potential to have a large impact as peptides presented by one super type member are often capable of being presented by another. Our preliminary studies suggest that expression of HLA-B*3906in NOD mice results in the acceleration of T1D. To further examine the effect of HLA-B*3906 on T1D, we will also determine the effect of HLA-B*3906 on T1D incidence in NOD mice lacking murine class I MHC. A similar model has been used to identify HLA-A*0201-restricted ? cell epitopes, a method we will apply to HLA-B*3906.To do so, we will map potential epitopes from both human and murine ? cell antigens. These epitopes could then be used in future immunomodulatory therapies."
"9381250","During the past 5 years, we have pursued our interest in lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and intravascular lipolysis, focusing on the specific aims in our original grant application. Our studies have been productive, yielding papers that describe insights into the LPL sequences that interact with GPIHBP1 and insights into the cellular mechanisms for GPIHBP1-mediated transport of LPL across endothelial cells. In this renewal application, we have proposed three new specific aims. The first aim relates to our discovery that some cases of human hypertriglyceridemia are caused by GPIHBP1 autoantibodies. We now need to better characterize this new disease syndrome and define its frequency. Our second aim relates to our discovery that GPIHBP1 is present in human plasma and that GPIHBP1 levels can be quantified with an ELISA. We now need to determine if GPIHBP1 levels in the plasma are a useful biomarker of metabolic or vascular disease. Our third aim deals with persistent and fundamental questions regarding the LPL?GPIHBP1 complex, including the stoichiometry of the complex and how its stability and activity are influenced by physiologic variables. We have accumulated substantial preliminary data to support the feasibility of our proposed studies. With regard to the first specific aim, we have already documented GPIHBP1 autoantibodies in plasma samples from six patients with hypertriglyceridemia. One of the patients became pregnant and, as expected, the autoantibodies crossed the placenta. The newborn infant?s plasma contained GPIHBP1 autoantibodies, resulting in extremely severe (but transient) hypertriglyceridemia. The discovery that GPIHBP1 autoantibodies cause hypertriglyceridemia is a translational discovery with major implications for medical diagnostics and therapeutics. We now need to better characterize GPIHBP1 autoantibodies and determine the frequency of the ?GPIHBP1 autoantibody syndrome.? For the second specific aim, we already developed and characterized monoclonal antibodies against human GPIHBP1 and used two of the antibodies to create an ELISA for human GPIHBP1. Our ELISA accurately quantifies GPIHBP1 in the plasma. We are poised to collaborate with leaders of genetic?epidemiology studies to test whether plasma GPIHBP1 levels are a useful biomarker of vascular or metabolic disease. With regard to the third specific aim, we have made substantial progress in understanding the LPL?GPIHBP1 complex and in developing experimental approaches to study that complex. Our studies suggest that there is only a single binding site for GPIHBP1 on newly secreted LPL (despite the fact that LPL is widely presumed to be a homodimer). Related studies suggest that GPIHBP1 binds only one molecule of LPL. We need to confirm these results with additional experimental platforms, including surface plasmon resonance studies. We also need to determine how LPL?GPIHBP1 interactions are affected by physiologic variables such as active triglyceride lipolysis or inhibitor proteins (e.g., ANGPTL4). These studies will add substantially to our understanding of LPL?GPIHBP1 interactions and the physiology of intravascular lipolysis."

"9492866","PROJECT SUMMARY  An impressive suite of tools is available for studying prostatic epithelial cells; surprisingly few exist for prostatic stroma, even though it drives most of the prostate's significant biologic behaviors. Prostatic stroma initiates glandular development and releases paracrine signals that stimulate epithelial growth during benign hyperplasia and cancer. It also synthesizes extracellular matrix molecules that mediate regenerative repair and increase organ stiffness, factors recently associated with urinary dysfunction. Pinpointing prostatic stromal progenitors and factors involved in their proliferation and differentiation are the first steps in identifying cellular mechanisms responsible for stroma-based disease processes. Our first aim uses a mouse genetic approach to identify progenitors giving rise to prostatic fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, perivascular cells and urinary striated muscle sphincter myocytes. We will use immunostaining and multispectral imaging to assign lineage labeled cells to two- and three?dimensional maps of prostatic stromal sub-compartments. These data will be presented using an innovative online tool that connects researchers with validated cre-expressing mouse lines and stromal- cell selective antibodies. Our second aim is to create a developing human prostatic stroma RNA and protein expression atlas to stimulate hypotheses that are relevant to prostatic disease causing behaviors of stromal progenitors identified in Aim 1. We will map expression patterns for key growth factors, receptors, and transcription factors that potentially mediate prostatic stromal and epithelial differentiation. This work complements the high-resolution developing mouse prostatic atlas we made previously for GUDMAP. Our results will be used to generate online tutorials of prostate development and we will identify homologous compartments between mouse and human. We will annotate human data when possible with the same terms used previously to annotate mouse data, providing a searchable online dataset which enables investigators to compare RNA/protein expression between mouse and human and identify conserved pathways across species. Our data will equip the prostate research community with the necessary tools to design and test new hypotheses about the pathogenic role of prostatic stroma in benign hyperplasia, inflammation, pain, and cancer."
"9298709","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma affects over 300 million individuals worldwide. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding ribonucleic acids (RNAs) that regulate protein synthesis by way of gene trans-repression or RNA silencing. A growing number of studies demonstrate that miRNAs control signaling pathways in every cell type and regulate inflammation. Thus, miRNAs likely play a profound role in the pathogenesis of asthma. Early miRNA studies have identified several miRNAs associated with asthma and corticosteroid treatment response. The presence of miRNAs stably expressed in blood indicate that miRNAs may be used as noninvasive biomarkers of asthma and asthma treatment response. The major goal of this project is to systematically investigate the role of circulating miRNAs in asthma severity and asthma treatment response. To accomplish this, we have specified three related but independent aims. The first aim evaluates data from the genome-wide sequencing of miRNAs in the serum of 500 asthmatics for their association with asthma severity at the time of enrollment into large clinical trial cohorts. The miRNA markers with the strongest evidence for differential expression will be tested for replication an independent clinical cohort and modeled using co-expression networks. The second aim seeks to understand the genomic basis for drug treatment response (pharmacogenomics). This aim will assess the genome-wide miRNAs for their differential expression with drug treatment response, as defined by change in lung function in response to inhaled corticosteroid medications. These miRNAs will be tested for replication in an independent clinical trial and then modeled using a Bayesian network approach for their ability to predict response to inhaled corticosteroids in asthma. Our final aim will be to interrogate the functional basis for our circulating miRNA findings in cellular models of airway smooth muscle function. Using miRNA mimics, our top miRNAs from our differential expression analyses will be tested for their ability to modulate airway smooth muscle proliferation and contractility (aim 1 miRNAs) or for their ability to mediate corticosteroid signaling (aim 2 miRNAs) in cells obtained from asthmatics. By simultaneously examining changes in gene expression, the mechanistic basis for the physiologic changes can be inferred. We believe that these findings will uncover the role of miRNAs basis for asthma severity and treatment response and lead to novel interventions to predict and alleviate this major health care problem."
"9513082","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) has a high morbidity and mortality with a four year survival ranges from 35% to 60 %, dependent on the presence or absence of cirrhosis. Despite over 40 years of research on AH, there is still no FDA approved treatment for this disease. The most commonly used off-label drugs for AH are corticosteroids and pentoxifylline. Unfortunately, even patients with AH treated with corticosteroids have a 6 month mortality of 40%. These poor clinical outcomes are due, in large part, to an incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of alcohol-mediated liver injury. Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective new therapies for this pernicious disease. This multicenter study will be a collaborative effort of four medical centers (Cleveland Clinic, University of Louisville, UT Southwestern, and University of Massachusetts) with its ultimate goal of transforming the clinical treatment of AH by rapidly translating novel and innovative basic science discoveries into clinical practice. In the first 2.5 years of the grant, two clinical trials will test the hypohesis that disruption of the normal gut-barrier function, over-activation of the inflammatory cascade, and innate immune activation are the primary elements of the complex pathogenesis of AH. In patients with severe AH, the first trial will compare a novel drug combination of anakinra (an inhibitor of IL-1 activity), pentoxifylline (a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that suppresses the inflammatory cytokine cascade), and zinc (which improves gut-barrier function) with the current standard of care therapy of treatment with corticosteroids. The second trial will compare probiotics (to improve gut-barrier function) to placebo in patients with moderate AH. The primary outcomes of both clinical trials will be 6 month mortality. Both trials will also supply specimens o the translational/basic science components of this UO1 consortium to identify novel biomarkers and altered pharmacogenetics that predict disease severity and response to pharmacologic therapy as well as to identify unique drug targets for novel treatments for AH. These new discoveries will then be translated rapidly to clinical testing in the last 2.5 years of the grant.A biorepository of the collected clinical data and patient samples will also be established that will be an important national resource for transforming clinical practice for the treatment of AH."
"9381399","Chronic fungal infections are often recalcitrant to treatment. The recalcitrance of chronic infections is not well understood, but likely involves multiple factors including biofilm formation, and slow growth. In addition, diverse studies in different systems from bacterial infections to human tumors, found that populations can have heterogeneous drug susceptibilities even before treatment is initiated, leading to treatment failures. Heterogeneity within populations of fungal pathogens has not been well studied. We have identified chronic high burden C. lusitaniae lung infections in three unrelated subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF). C. lusitaniae has been documented in CF lung infections previously, but infections dominated by C. lusitaniae are not widely reported. In all three subjects, C. lusitaniae isolates within each population showed high variance in antifungal sensitivity, measured as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), with some isolates stably resistant. We characterized the isolates from one subject further and discovered, through whole genome sequencing, that variable MICs correlated with heterogeneity in alleles of MRR1, a gene associated with clinical drug resistance in other Candida spp. exposed to drugs. Variation in MRR1 alleles within a single population was surprising as this subject had not been prescribed antifungals in the preceding year. Because of the ease of manipulation of C. lusitaniae, a haploid, genetically tractable, mating competent, yeast, we propose to leverage these isolate collections to study the basis for drug resistance, factors that promote selection for increased drug resistance, and factors that promote heterogeneous population structures in the lung. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that substitutions in the Mrr1 central regulatory domain and Mrr1 C-terminal truncations lead to increased activity (1.1), that common and distinct genes are controlled by different classes of Mrr1 variants (1.2), and that differentially expressed Mrr1-regulated genes contribute to fluconazole resistance (1.3). In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that specific SNPs impact metabolic diversity (2.1), high Mrr1 activity promotes fitness in isolates with high rates of glycolysis (2.2), and that metabolic diversification promotes heterogeneity in drug resistance in nutritionally complex environments (2.3). Because of the propensity of C. lusitaniae to develop resistance to potent drugs like amphotericin B, often the antifungal of last resort, and the close relationship between C. lusitaniae and a recent multi-drug resistant fungal pathogen of concern, Candida auris, these studies are highly relevant to discovering ways to better understand the composition of chronic infections, to limit the development of antifungal resistance, and to combat resistant isolates once they develop."
"9306091","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Loss of functional small bowel surface area following surgical resection for disorders including Crohn's disease, ischemia, trauma, or radiation enteritis may result in short bowel syndrome (SBS), an important cause of morbidity, mortality and health care costs in the U.S. SBS patients are frequently dependent on parenteral nutrition to meet their nutritional requirements. Following intestinal resection, the remaining small bowel epithelium mounts an adaptive response that increases villus height, crypt depth and enhances nutrient and electrolyte absorption. However, the adaptive response in humans is unpredictable and it may require up to two years to determine which patients will wean off parenteral nutrition, even with an accurate assessment of remnant small bowel length. The mechanistic basis for this clinical variability is unknown. Our application seeks to explore new regenerative, therapeutic approaches to enhance small bowel functional surface area, using patient biopsies from the PI's large SBS patient population. Our approach will translate observations from our preclinical models of short bowel syndrome and myofibroblast signaling in the stem cell niche into studies in human SBS that have therapeutic potential. We have shown that a myofibroblast protein, epimorphin (Epim) regulates crypt fission, gut epithelial proliferation and myofibroblast secretory function in mice. Co-culture with Epim-/- myofibroblasts further enhances WT mouse crypt enteroid growth and surface area. Our overarching goals are to enhance the proliferative epithelial response and increase small bowel surface area as a therapeutic strategy for SBS. Our overarching hypothesis is that modulating myofibroblast Epim and its targets will enhance human small bowel growth providing a novel regenerative therapeutic approach to SBS. Aim 1 will directly translate our mouse studies by establishing stem cell/enteroid and myofibroblast cultures from the PI's large cohort of SBS patients. We will address the hypothesis that co- culture with Epim-deficient myofibroblasts increases the growth of human enteroids. We will determine whether growth and proliferative capacity of enteroids in vitro can predict the ability t adapt and wean from parenteral nutrition. Aim 2 will address two hypotheses. 1. MF-crypt epithelial interactions are modulated by Epim deletion to increase crypt stem cell proliferation and enteroid growth via altered Bmp, Hh, and Wnt signaling pathways. 2. Epim demonstrates context-specific inhibitory vs. pro-exocytotic roles in regulating MF secretion. Our studies are significant because we will directly translate our findings from preclinical studies to human studies of Epim deletion's effects on MF function in the stem cell niche. We will expand our unique clinical collection of small bowel crypt stem/enteroid cultures from SBS patients, and generate a national resource for potential future high throughput screening of therapeutic agents that enhance stem and crypt cell proliferation in SBS. Epim and the secretion of soluble factors that are modulated by Epim deletion represent potential novel therapeutic targets to promote intestinal stem/crypt epithelial proliferation, leading to adaptation. ."
