"9329913","Abstract:  Breast cancer is the most frequent malignant tumor of women of all races in North America and is the second leading cause of death among women (DHHS, CDC, & NCI; 2014) with an overall NIH estimate costs to the U.S. over $200 billion with $88.7 billion in direct medical costs in 2011. The World Health Organization predicts that global cases of cancer will rise to 15 million new cases by 2020. In advanced stages, skeletal metastasis causes incapacitating pain and is prominent in 75?90% of cancer patients. First line therapy to treat bone cancer pain includes mu opioid receptor agonists. Opioids are well known for producing unwanted side effects in cancer patients including severe somnolence, constipation, etc. but recently have been shown (clinical and preclinical) to enhance the risk of bone loss and fracture. In addition, sustained opioids have demonstrated a propensity for increasing proliferation and migration of different cancers including breast cancer.  Data from our laboratory, and others, suggest that cannabinoid CB2 agonists may be effective in alleviating bone cancer pain and bone loss. Selective CB2 agonists significantly inhibit bone cancer pain while NOT resulting in the psychotropic or euphoric effects seen with CB1 agonists or narcotics. Recent reports and data from our lab have identified CB2 agonists as significantly reducing self-administration of drugs of abuse including cocaine and narcotics. Increasing endogenous cannabinoids (MAGL inhibition to increase 2- arachidonylglycerol - 2AG) may regulate bone mass, decrease pro-nociceptive factors and act synergistically with morphine to inhibit cancer-induced bone pain (CIBP) and attenuate tumor proliferation.  Our preliminary studies using a murine bone cancer model indicate that MAGL inhibition and CB2 receptor activation inhibits proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines via regulating NF-?B. Yet, there is very little known about the endogenous CB2 system in bone cancer pain/inflammation, and whether the activation of the endocannabinoid (eCB) system, while administering mu opioids, will significantly aid bone cancer patients. There are NO studies investigating the synergistic combination of MAGL inhibitor or CB2 agonists with a mu opioid agonist on cancer pain, bone integrity, tumor proliferation, or attenuating mu opioid unwanted side effects. Our progress in characterizing bone cancer pain has resulted in twelve direct peer-reviewed publications and preliminary data to further support studies of MAGL inhibition, CB2 receptor activation in bone cancer pain. Our preliminary data demonstrate; 1) a reproducible syngeneic breast-induced bone cancer model representative of the clinical state, 2) MAGLipase inhibition resulting in increased 2AG, significantly attenuating cancer-induced pain, 3) exogenous and endogenous CB2 agonists attenuating bone loss, 4) sustained morphine alone increases bone degradation and cytokines, 5) CB2 agonists and MAGL inhibitors decrease NF-kB signaling, inhibiting several pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, while reinstating apoptosis in breast cancer cells, 6) synergistic inhibition of CIBP with morphine and CB2 agonists, and 7) CB2 agonists lacking unwanted side effects. Hence, MAGLipase inhibitors in combination with morphine may be synergistic in alleviating bone cancer pain, attenuate breast cancer proliferation while maintaining bone mass.  In response to the recent call for proposals (RFA PA-15-188) titled ?Developing the Therapeutic Potential of the Endocannabinoid System for Pain Treatment? and our preliminary findings have led us to hypothesize that MAGLipase inhibition and/or CB2 receptor activation, in combination with a Mu opioid agonist will result in the synergistic inhibition of pain behaviors in a murine model of breast-induced bone cancer pain while attenuating bone loss seen with opioids. Mechanistically, 2AG and CB2 agonists act via the CB2 receptor to inhibit a common transcription factor, NF-?B, regulating multiple cytokines/chemokines. We propose to use behavioral, biochemical, immune and molecular strategies to test whether MAGL inhibition and/or CB2 agonist, in the presence of morphine (standard clinical care) will be a beneficial therapy for breast-induced bone cancer pain. This hypothesis will be tested by the following Aims using our syngeneic (non-immune-compromised) murine model of CIBP: Aim 1. Determine whether the inhibition of MAGLipase attenuates breast cancer-induced bone pain and/or alter bone resorption and remodeling. Aim 2. Explore whether MAGLipase inhibition and CB2 receptor activation attenuates breast cancer-induced bone pain by inhibiting pronociceptive cytokines/chemokines via a common transcription factor. Aim 3. Determine whether a MAGL inhibitor and the activation of the CB2 and Mu opioid receptors result in the synergistic inhibition of breast cancer-induced bone pain while reducing bone loss. These studies will lead to urgently needed new treatments and may likely apply to other metastatic cancers, including lung and prostate."
"9226063","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Engaging students in authentic research experiences and equipping teachers with the necessary knowledge, skills, and tools essential to lead research within the classroom is critical for increasing the pipeline leading to biomedical fields. The Bringing Research into the Classroom (BRIC) project directly aligns with the NCRR goals of development of a diversified pipeline for basic, behavioral and clinical research fields, and to educate the community on health-related issues by utilizing an intensive teacher professional development program focusing on discipline-specific research in bacteriophage discovery. By equipping teachers to facilitate intensive research experiences within their classrooms, the BRIC project aims to build a legacy of teacher leaders who will provide authentic science opportunities for their students.         The BRIC project is built upon seven years of collaborative efforts between the Montana Tech Phagedigging Program and Cfwep.Org (formerly known as the Clark Fork Watershed Education Program). Both programs have proven track records in science education outreach efforts. Combined the two programs have reached over 20,000 students and 300 teachers. These two highly successful programs have designed the BRIC project, a new program to provide intensive teacher professional development combined with in-class visits by scientists. The overall project goal is to equip teachers with the knowledge, skills, and dispositions to provide high quality health science research opportunities for students.         The project's specific aims for teachers are to: 1) Increase teacher science content knowledge especially as related to phage discovery research; 2) Increase teacher pedagogical skills, and discipline-specific research practices within the classroom; and 3). Provide meaningful, engaging professional development for teachers that engages teachers in a rigorous research question during the summer. For students, the project aims to: 1) Increase student content knowledge especially as related to phage discovery research; 2) Improve student awareness of health sciences careers as well as their attitudes and dispositions toward the health sciences; and 3) Engage students in relevant, meaningful classroom research experiences.         The BRIC program leaders will provide phage discovery research curriculum within all participating teacher's classrooms. Scientists from Montana Tech, accompanied by undergraduate students, lead three days of bacteriophage discovery projects, also known as phagedigging. Teachers engage in intensive summer training workshops that include discipline-specific research content and pedagogical approaches for the classroom. The project leaders have developed an experimental design in order to examine the effect of professional development combined with classroom visits as compared to classroom visits alone for both teachers and students."

"9311432","PROJECT SUMMARY Dendrites exhibit immense diversity in their macrostructure (arbors), which stipulates the availability of a neuron to circuits and its computational properties, and microstructure (dendritic spines), which dynamically support and shape synaptic function. Arbor and spine/synapse development must be coordinated to form functional dendrites. Though synaptic activity plays a crucial role, the heterogeneity of developmental responses to activity indicates that other mechanisms are required. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that the adhesion G-protein coupled receptor (A-GPCR) brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1 (BAI1/ ADGRB1) coordinates dendritic arbor and spine development through differential activation of multiple signaling pathways. This hypothesis is based on our published and preliminary data showing: (i) that BAI1 mediates growth arrest of dendritic arbors via a novel pathway coupling to the Rho-family small GTPase RhoA; (ii) that BAI1 promotes excitatory synaptogenesis in cortical and hippocampal neurons via the Rho-family small GTPase Rac1 and trans-synaptic signaling; and (iii) that BAI1 differentially affects dendrite development in an age-dependent manner and that altering BAI1 configuration has age-dependent effects on downstream signaling pathways. We propose a multidisciplinary approach to define the roles of BAI A-GPCRs in regulating and coordinating dendritic arbor and spine/synapse development utilizing in vivo and cultured neurons, genetic models, molecular replacement, live imaging with fluorescent reporters, mixed culture assays, biochemistry and electrophysiology. The pathways that we are defining include proteins implicated in treatment-resistant bipolar disorder (Bcr), autism spectrum disorder (neuroligin-1 and IRSp53), and schizophrenia (BAI3). Thus, success of this proposal will not only provide material advances in the study of dendrite development and synaptogenesis, but also test a novel and powerful hypothesis regarding the coordination of these processes and provide new therapeutic targets against widespread human mental diseases."
"9254580","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is essential for neurodevelopment. If maternal DHA reserves are adequate during pregnancy, at parturition RBC-DHA of the mother would be ? the infant, i.e., DHA equilibrium. Previously, we randomized pregnant women to placebo oil or DHA (600 mg/day). We discovered that the majority of subjects did not achieve DHA equilibrium (5% placebo, 35% DHA), indicating DHA insufficiency, which has been reported to limit infant neurodevelopment. To test whether DHA insufficiency limited fetal neurodevelopment in our sample, we applied an innovative analysis method to estimate fetal brain maturation. Results confirmed that maternal DHA insufficiency significantly constrained fetal autonomic brain age scores (fABAS). Our hypothesis is that many pregnant women fail to get adequate DHA in their diet and that DHA insufficiency constrains fetal and infant neurodevelopment. The long-term goal is to provide the neuroscience to inform public health recommendations related to the use and dose of prenatal DHA supplementation, the influence of dietary fatty acids and the effect on offspring neurodevelopment. This is aligned with the strategic and scientific vision of NICHD and the mission of national and international health organizations that recognize that prenatal exposures set the stage for future health and disease. We propose a randomized Phase III clinical trial of 200 or 800 mg/day DHA during the last two trimesters of pregnancy to achieve these aims: Aim 1) Increase the incidence of DHA equilibrium with 800 mg/day maternal DHA supplementation. Hypothesis: The dosing strategy will result in significant group differences with a higher incidence of DHA equilibrium in the grou receiving 800 mg/day DHA supplementation. Aim 2) Establish whether failure to achieve DHA equilibrium constrains fetal neurodevelopment. Hypothesis: DHA insufficiency will constrain fetal neurodevelopment as evidenced by lower fetal cardiac and brain autonomic indices (HRV, fABAS) at 32 and 36 weeks GA. Aim 3) Determine if fetal neurodevelopmental scores predict infant neurodevelopment. Hypothesis: DHA insufficiency associated with lower fetal HRV and fABAS scores will have a programming effect evidenced by 1) lower band-limited EEG power at 1 month of age to infrequent auditory stimuli, 2) decreased habituation to familiar visual stimuli at 6 and 12 months, evidenced by a larger ERP negative central (NC) component and 3) reduced maintenance of sustained attention and longer overall ocular latency between 4-6 months. Relevance to Public Health: Currently, there are no FDA recommendations for DHA supplementation during pregnancy. If the aims of this proposal are achieved, it could lead to informed recommendations with respect to the appropriate use and effective dose of supplemental DHA and dietary recommendations during pregnancy, especially in populations where the nutritional status of the diet is suboptimal."
"9376983","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Each year, 11,000 people suffer a spinal cord injury (SCI) in the U.S. Within the first year, there are profound declines in physiologic function, forming the underlying substrate for future cardiovascular disease. In fact, acquired cardiovascular disease is an increasingly recognized consequence of SCI and is the leading cause of death in SCI. Though incompletely understood, the almost 10-fold prevalence of cardiovascular disease results in part from profound physiologic 'detraining' resulting from motor impairment and immobility. Currently, effective interventions preventing acute declines that lead to cardiovascular compromise and increased risk in SCI are lacking - exercise therapy for those with SCI is challenging and when employed, is typically limited to the upper body. Recently, we refined a unique form of exercise for those with SCI that specifically mirrors exercise performed by those without SCI. Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) Row Training (RT) couples volitional arm and electrically controlled leg exercise, resulting in a hemodynamic profile that produces the beneficial cardiac loading conditions of large muscle mass exercise. As such, FES-RT may be a safe and effective way to attenuate cardiovascular declines following SCI. Our aims are to test the overall hypotheses that FES-RT will: 1) mitigate against increased visceral adiposity and reduced insulin sensitivity, 2) prevent worsening lipid profile and compromised baroreflex function, and 3) counter ventricular wall thickening and declining ventricular function occurring with acute SCI, and that these effects will be greater than that observed with an arms-only exercise group. Changes with FES-RT will be compared to a time (wait-list) control and to arms-only-RT. Individuals with an SCI within the last 3-6 months will be randomized to immediate FES-RT, to a time control beginning FES-RT after a 6 month wait, or 6 months of arms-only-RT followed by FES-RT. Measures will be made at baseline and every 3 months. Our work will provide results that clearly delineate potential health benefits of FES-RT, and if FES-RT is effective in a majority of those with SCI, its application, implementation, and integration could be easily replicated."
"9212808","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Therapeutic proteins provide unique treatments for numerous human diseases and disorders including cancer, multiple sclerosis, hemophilia, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease and diabetes. Unfortunately, in significant fractions of patients receiving therapeutic protein products (up to 50% or higher), efficacy is lost due to immune response to the product. Immunogenicity may be stimulated by the presence of protein aggregates. In this project, we will use a hierarchical approach that uses advanced computer simulations combined with state-of-the art experiments to provide detailed, molecular-level information on the mechanisms by which protein aggregation occurs. Experiments will utilize synthetic proteins with designed chemical characteristics, model therapeutic proteins in murine models and commercial therapeutic proteins. Protein aggregates and pathways for their formation will be analyzed using a wide array of experimental techniques including single-molecule total internal reflectance fluorescence-Forster resonant energy transfer, small angle neutron scattering, small angle x-ray scattering micro-flow imaging, surface micro-rheology, chromatography, circular dichroism spectroscopy and infrared spectroscopy. A major focus of this renewal proposal will be the extension of our current work on protein aggregation in homogeneous solutions to protein aggregation that occurs due to interactions with interfaces such as those found in delivery devices (e.g., syringes, IV bags, IV lines, and delivery pumps)."

"9241317","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Clinical trials of alcohol use disorders (AUD) treatments have contributed significantly to the advancement of knowledge regarding treatment processes and outcomes. Such studies have yielded a strong evidence base regarding the efficacy of several psychosocial alcohol treatments, to include brief interventions. Irrespective o the proliferation of clinical trials research, based on manual driven treatments specifying underlying mechanisms of behavior change (MOBC), little is known about how such evidence based treatments actually work. Similarly, studies investigating assessment reactivity effects have contributed substantially to our understanding of alcohol treatment research assessment protocols influencing clinical outcomes (e.g., alcohol use), although empirical studies examining underlying mechanisms of behavior change have not been conducted. Thus, the state of the science is such that we know little about how specific alcohol treatments or research assessment protocols influence behavior change. This lack of understanding regarding the mechanisms by which alcohol treatments and research assessment protocols influence behavior change prompted NIAAA to release (2013) a funding opportunity announcement (PAR-14-051), titled Mechanisms of Behavior Change in the Treatment of Alcohol Use Disorders (R01), that specifically requests applications that identify the mechanisms that underlie how assessment reactivity operates within alcohol treatment protocols (p. 4). This application is in direct response to this funding opportunity announcement and centers on an investigation of mechanisms of behavior change underlying alcohol treatment research assessment reactivity. Enhanced understanding of the mechanisms that underlie psychosocial alcohol treatments and assessment reactivity has direct relevance for the design of alcohol treatment clinical trials, the interpretation of data derived from such studies, and for behavior change and its maintenance, which is essential for successful interventions. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to enhance clinical research and practice via a more in-depth understanding of the mechanisms that influence behavior change, thereby increasing the power of alcohol interventions to facilitate reductions in alcohol use."
"9307127","Human-associated microorganisms (the ?microbiome?) are present in numbers exceeding the quantities of human cells by at least 10-fold, and the collective genome (the ?metagenome?) exceeds our human genome in terms of gene content by more than 150-fold. We and others have recently demonstrated that bacteria are detected in the placenta using a variety of culturable and non-culturable approaches. For several years we have developed and employed metagenomics to characterize the placental microbiome, and observed variation in its community membership and their function by virtue of gestational age at delivery. However, it remains unknown what the different maternal source(s) are of the placental microbiome, and whether it sinks to the fetus via the intra-amniotic cavity and thus is measureable in amniotic fluid.  In response to the Human Placental Project, we propose to identify the sources and sinks for and of the placental microbiome employing two large, robust and well characterized existing datasets. We will generate unparalleled metagenomics and metabolomics data, in order to test our central hypothesis that the placenta is populated by commensal microbiota which largely arise from the maternal oral and GI communities, with a lesser contribution from the vagina. We further hypothesize that placental microbes populate the fetus and the intrauterine environment, and are detectable in mid-trimester amniotic fluid. Moreover, their metabolites serve as lasting signatures of the microbiotas functional presence.  In order to prove this hypothesis, we will execute three essential aims in a total of over 1230 subjects samples from two existing data sets. The net result of the completion of these aims will be to first identify the maternal source of the placental microbiota, and validate these findings using state of the art single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization and culturation. We will thereafter recapitulate these findings in early and mid- second trimester amniotic fluid and thus identify the early evidence of the placental microbiota sink. In a final aim, we will use LC/MS full spectral metabolomics on these same subjects samples to identify the stable and lasting metabolic footprint of the microbiome. We present our proof of concept work on intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy as evidence for the feasibility, significance and ready translational application of our approach.  As a proven team of perinatal physician scientists with an emphasis and history of being at the forefront of big data (and notably metagenomics) science, we are uniquely poised to now undertake complex integration of these unique data sets in studies which are feasible, justifiable, and of likely long-term significance and high impact."
"9236144","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Binge alcohol drinking is the most prevalent form of alcoholism in the United States, with high rates of binge drinking reported in adolescents and young adults. This is concerning as adolescence/early adulthood is a period of robust neurodevelopment during which forebrain glutamate neurons establish their connectivity with subcortical structures within the extended amygdala that regulate emotionality and motivated behavior. Thus, binge drinking during this critical period is likely to grossly perturb the developmental trajectories of glutamate systems within the extended amygdala, which may contribute to the high prevalence of comorbid affective and alcohol use disorders. Indeed, an early history of alcohol abuse is reported to advance significantly the onset of psychiatric symptoms of affective disorders in humans. Consistent with the human condition, alcohol-naïve male and female adolescent mice are hyper-reactive to stressors and voluntarily binge drink greater amounts of alcohol, than their adult counterparts. Also consistent with the human condition, adolescent-onset binge drinkers are insensitive to the hang-over-related anxiogenic state produced by early alcohol withdrawal, but their stressor reactivity incubates during protracted withdrawal. Thus, it is hypothesized that developmental differences exist in alcohol-induced perturbations within the extended amygdala neural circuitry underpinning emotionality, which impact the manifestation of negative affect during alcohol withdrawal. The present proposal seeks to answer a number of research questions pertaining to the impact of excessive voluntary binge alcohol intake on affective behavior as a function of the interactions between age of binge drinking onset X duration of alcohol abstinence using a novel, but well-validated, murine model. As age of drinking onset X sex interactions are reported for affective and alcohol use disorder comorbidity, Aim 1 will carefully control early life experiences and alcohol exposure to characterize the ontogeny of binge drinking-induced negative affect in both male and female subjects. These studies will chart how the manifestation of withdrawal-induced changes in affect vary as a function drug abstinence, potentially vary with reproductive cycle and relate to subsequent binge drinking. Aim 2 will employ immunoblotting procedures to identify subject factor interactions in the biochemical correlates of alcohol withdrawal-induced hyper-anxiety and binge drinking. Aim 3 will then employ behavioral neuropharmacological approaches to determine the functional relevance of alcohol withdrawal- induced changes in glutamate neurotransmission within the central nucleus of the amygdala for subject factor interactions in anxiety and depression measures. The results of these studies will provide novel insight into the neurobiological impact of adolescent binge drinking upon excitatory neurotransmission within a neural circuit critical for emotionality and motivated behavior and will determine the relevance of such changes for affective and alcohol use disorder comorbidity. Such information will not only further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating individual differences in excessive alcohol intake, but provide greater insight into the etiology of alcoholism-affective disorder comorbidity to direct more effective treatment."
"9440850","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The UCSF Microbial Pathogenesis and Host Defense (MPHD) program provides a comprehensive, world-class training plan to prepare graduate students and postdoctoral fellows for future careers in academics, industry, public health, or teaching. The MPHD program's primary goal is to train the next generation of leaders in this critically important field. Recent rapid advances in microbial pathogenesis, immunology, the genetics, genomics, and systems biology provide unprecedented opportunities to improve the health of mankind worldwide. The importance of training our next generation of scientific leaders to use these tools for innovative approaches has never been greater. Our program provides outstanding trainees with funded research opportunities in cutting edge, interdisciplinary scientific training environments. UCSF hosts an unusual number of world-class laboratories in each aspect of microbial pathogenesis, including bacterial, viral, fungal, parasitic, and innate immunity research programs. The faculty has an outstanding track record of creative and high profile research, excellent mentoring, and substantial research funding, and thus attracts outstanding trainees. Likewise, the MPHD program has catalyzed new scientific directions and broadened the training opportunities in microbial pathogenesis by bringing together laboratories with traditional expertise in the field with those from diverse scientific fields. Thus, a major objective of our research training program is to capitalize on the strengths of the UCSF research community to create an integrative program focused on issues in host-microbe interactions. As an interdepartmental and intercampus program at UCSF, the MPHD Program is open to all UCSF graduate students and postdoctoral fellows with an interest in microbial pathogenesis. The program integrates students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty from diverse programs, expertise, and backgrounds by nourishing synergistic interactions and facilitating new approaches not otherwise possible. MPHD trainees are drawn from an elite pool of very highly qualified students and postdoctoral fellows. Outstanding institutional core facilities are availabl to accelerate application of new and emerging technologies. The strong tradition of openness and collaboration among UCSF laboratories and research groups allows trainees to easily access diverse expertise from multiple faculty. The program is comprised of the following program-specific components: a weekly seminar series, a yearly Bay Area-wide symposium, yearly graduate student elective courses in MPHD, and a postdoctoral mentoring program that augments the already high caliber of postdoctoral training by matching fellows with an additional mentor separate from their PI (the affiliated graduate students are already cross-mentored through their respective graduate programs). In this grant renewal, we request continuation of 4 pre-doctoral slots and 2 post-doctoral slots, to provide support at the same level as in prior years. This support will allow us to continue our history of training the next generation of leader in microbial pathogenesis who will work to reduce the worldwide burden of infectious disease."
"9238804","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are proteins originally identified on the basis of their ability to deacetylate histones resulting in transcriptionally repression. HDACs also deacetylate a large number of other proteins in the nucleus, cytoplasm and mitochondria thereby regulating diverse cellular events. Compelling evidence indicates that HDACs regulate the survival and death of neurons. Indeed, several laboratories have demonstrated that chemical inhibitors of HDACs are strongly protective in many different experimental invertebrate and rodent models of neurodegenerative disease. The focus of this application is on HDAC3, an HDAC that we discovered has strong neurotoxic activity and representing a likely target of HDAC inhibitors in their neuroprotective effect. We found that neurons are selectively sensitive to HDAC3 toxicity and that HDAC3-induced neuronal death requires its phosphorylation by GSK3?, a kinase implicated in several neurodegenerative disorders. The current application follows up on these findings to examine in more detail the mechanism by which HDAC3 promotes neurodegeneration. In addition to using paradigms of neuronal death unrelated to disease states, we will study the role of HDAC3 in Huntington disease (HD) pathogenesis. We have observed that HDAC3 interacts with huntingtin protein (Htt), mutation of which causes HD. We hypothesize that the HDAC3 plays a pivotal role in the neurotoxic effect of mutant-Htt and that mutant-Htt stimulates the release of HDAC3 thereby de-repressing its neurotoxic activity. Based on recently acquired data, we propose that HDAC3 neurotoxicity requires the participation of HDAC1, another Class I HDAC with which HDAC3 interacts. The specific goals of our application are: (1) To study the contribution of HDAC3 to Htt-mediated neuronal survival and to mutant-huntingtin-induced neuronal death, (2) To investigate the contribution of HDAC1 in HDAC3 and mutant-Htt toxicity, (3) To identify downstream targets of HDAC3- mediated neurotoxicity, and (4) To study the effect of HDAC3 deficiency on neuropathology in the R6/2 and BACHD mouse models of HD by breeding these mice to forebrain-specific HDAC3 conditional knockout mice that we have just generated. The studies we propose will shed new insight into the fundamental mechanisms regulating neuronal survival and death, as well as how these mechanisms relate to HD."
"9345836","This proposal aims to develop highly specific, rapid and cost-effective immunoassays to detect Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. ZIKV is a single-stranded RNA virus in the Flaviviridae family that is transmitted to humans through infected mosquitos, blood transfusions, and sexual contact. As of June 2016, around 500,000 Zika Virus disease cases have been estimated in Brazil alone. Recently, ZIKV has been detected in many other countries including the USA and most European countries. The FDA has recently mandated screening the entire US blood supply for ZIKV. Key challenges in ZIKV surveillance include the proportion of cases that remain asymptomatic and the nonspecificity of ZIKV symptoms. Current methods available for detection of ZIKV are not rapid, and furthermore, suffer from problems of unreliability and risks of cross-reactivity. A highly specific, easily performed antibody test is urgently needed for both surveillance and patient care. Mediomics has developed and commercialized a new assay platform (PINCER assays) that allows simple homogenous mix-and-read detection of a variety of targets. These rapid-result assays can reach high specificity while remaining low cost and easy to use. In a recent collaboration with the CDC, Mediomics developed a PINCER-based homogeneous assay prototype for hepatitis C (HCV) that achieved 97.3% specificity, 98.7% sensitivity, and inter and intra assay CV?s better than 10%. These promising analytical parameters, combined with the simplicity of homogenous detection, indicate a great potential for this assay platform. In addition, our long term collaborator, Dr. Tomasz Heyduk?s laboratory, developed a novel screening platform by combining both ribosome display and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies to quickly identify linear and conformational epitopes of antibodies from patient samples. We hypothesize that by combining our PINCER platform and the peptide epitopes unique to the ZIKV infection, we will be able to develop a specific, rapid, and cost effective immunoassay for ZIKV detection. Toward this goal, we have three specific aims in our Phase I project. Aim 1. Develop a PINCER-based homogeneous immunoassay for ZIKV detection. Aim 2. Explore entire protein sequence space of ZIKV to identify peptide ligands specifically recognized by ZIKV antibodies in patient blood samples. Aim 3. Optimize and evaluate the performance of both peptide and improved antigen-based PINCER assays. A third party will perform the evaluation of the prototype assay. If this project is successful, we should have established a solid foundation for a Phase II project to fully develop and validate a novel immunoassay that is simple (mix-and-read), rapid (10-30 minutes), cost-effective (<5-10% of ELISA), and suitable for low to high throughput screening of ZIKV infection."
"9245741","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Modern neuroscience seeks to identify, and manipulate with precision, specific cell types in the brain to identify mechanisms of circuit assembly, function, and neural disease. These technologies are a prerequisite to a large number of fields of study, from systems neuroscience to molecular developmental analysis, and are key to providing insights not only into neural function, but also disease processes, including aging, neurodegeneration, and neural repair developing tools to label and manipulate specific neuronal types is generally costly and time-consuming. The objective of this application is to develop and release to the scientific community an extensive and versatile toolkit for manipulation of the nervous system of Drosophila, a powerful genetic model that has generated many fundamental insights into nervous system function and development. This application has three central aims. First, we propose to generate 4,000 new transgenic lines based on the recently developed InSITE system. These strains will allow cell-specific manipulations of gene expression in the vast majority of neurons in the fly. Each of these insertion sites will be molecularly mapped, and the expression pattern captured by each line will be described in both larval and adult fly brains. Second, using this collection, we will derive cell-type specific intersectional tools, as well as independent transcriptional regulatory systems, allowing gene expression to be manipulated in multiple individual cell types, independently. Third, we will create a database describing these data that will enable the community to make full use of this resource to address a wide range of scientific questions. This collection will provide a platform for introducing a versatile collection of markers and drivers of gene expression into a large number of the neuronal types present in the larval and adult nervous systems for release to the Drosophila community. Once this resource is established, the methods for using and extending the collection involve only basic genetic crosses that can be adapted in any lab. We expect that this collection will seed an expanding, highly versatile, and cost-effective collection of tools fo manipulation of the nervous system and gene discovery."

The members, however, share a common interest in research that is related to diabetes and metabolism or is fundamental to understanding its pathogenesis or for the development of new treatment strategies. The design of the Yale DRC is aimed at developing an Infrastructure that could serve as a catalyst to stimulate innovative diabetes-related research. The cornerstone of the DRC is its five Research Cores that provide funded basic and clinical investigators with the opportunity to more efficiently utilize resources and expand the scope of their research programs. The Clinical Metabolism and the Diabetes Translational Cores facilitate metabolic research in patients, whereas the Molecular Genetic Mouse Core, Physiology and Cell Biology Cores that comprise the more basic science focus of the Center offer investigators the tools to create and test novel animal models starting from the molecule and ending with biological outcomes. The Administrative Core oversees the operation ofthe Center, Its Pilot/Feasibility Project and Enrichment Programs, and helps to coordinate patient-based research in diabetes.     The goals ofthe DRC are to: 1) stimulate multldisciplinary Interactions, particularly between basic and clinical scientists; 2) encourage established Investigators not presently working in diabetes-related areas, to bring their expertise to bear on problems relevant to diabetes; 3) efficiently organize time consuming and/or costly techniques through Core facilities to enhance the productivity of investigators conducting research in diabetes related areas; 4) promote new research programs through pilot feasibility projects; 5) enhance the quality of  research training, and 6) create a stimulating institutional environment that enhances research efforts by its members to develop new strategies to prevent and treat diabetes and related metabolic disorders at the local and national level."
"9421692","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The significance of the impacts of the intestinal microbiota on human health and disease cannot be overstated. It is undeniable that these microbes are integral to the healthy function of the hosts they colonize. They provide a plethora of beneficial functions including ones impacting nutrition, development of the immune system, and protection from pathogens. However, many diseases are associated with changes in the composition, structure, or function of these communities, including obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, colon cancer, and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea. Unfortunately, there is not currently a deep enough understanding of the host-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions that govern community structure and function to fully explicate disease development. More importantly, current knowledge is not sufficient to facilitate the development of therapies aimed at restoring healthy function of dysbiotic communities in order to ameliorate disease. Therefore, the overarching goal of this proposal is to expand our knowledge of how the host impacts community assembly and dynamics, and inform us about adaptive strategies of commensal organisms. More specifically, I propose to determine the selective pressures exerted by the host innate immune response during bacterial adaptation to the vertebrate gut. Herein I will test the hypothesis that there is an optimal immunogenicity of commensal bacteria such that adaptation in the presence of a functional innate immune system results in a shift towards this optimum level. To accomplish this, I will use the gnotobiotc zebrafish model to investigate the selective pressures exerted by the host innate immune system during adaption of a natural gut isolate. This is a simple yet powerful model system because it specifically allows for observation of interactions between the innate immune response and the selected bacterium. Two different approaches will be used to generate variant strains of Aeromonas ZOR0001 (Aer01) that have increased fitness in the zebrafish gut. In AIM 1 a forward genetic screen (Tn-seq) is used to assay the fitness contributions of the entire genetic repertoire of Aer01 to specifically identify mutations that result in increased fitness in vivo. In AIM 2, an adaptive evolution approach is used to compare genetic adaptations conferring increased fitness when evolved in WT versus immunodeficient hosts. Gain-of-fitness mutations identified by each approach will be constructed in the WT ancestral genetic background and their colonization fitness and capacity to stimulate the host immune response assayed. These two approaches allow for an unbiased identification of the genetic determinants of adaptation of Aer01, maximizing the potential to study multiple avenues of bacterial adaptation and the selective pressures exerted by the host innate immune system. The impact of this work is significant because it will provide insights into how the the innate immune system shapes commensal fitness in the vertebrate gut, which is knowledge that can be exploited to precisely manipulate host-associated microbiota and moves us closer to advanced biotherapeutic treatments for dysbiotic diseases."
"9244834","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Perinatal lung maturation allows transition to independent extrauterine life and requires concerted expansion of the epithelial gas exchange surface and the juxtaposed capillaries. Interruption of this process by premature birth is a major risk factor for serious lung diseases, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) that frequently manifests as alveolar simplification and dysmorphic capillaries. Although covering >95% of the alveolar surface and overlaying most of the alveolar vasculature, alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells are traditionally considered a passive structural component and attention has been focused on alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells because of their stem cell potential and role in surfactant production. This, combined with technical challenges in studying the ultra-thin (<0.1 um) AT1 cell extensions, results in our limited knowledge of the role of AT1 cells in normal and pathological alveologenesis. An in-depth understanding of AT1 cells during development is necessary to catch up with recent progress in studying AT2 cells and fibroblasts to obtain a complete picture of perinatal lung maturation. Our preliminary data support a novel hypothesis that AT1 cells have a signaling role in coordinating alveolar morphogenesis and angiogenesis during perinatal lung maturation. This proposal has the following three specific aims. (1) To determine whether AT1 cell development promotes alveolar angiogenesis. (2) To determine whether AT1 cell derived angiogenic factors promote alveolar angiogenesis. (3) To determine whether AT1 cell dysfunction contributes to hyperoxia-induced alveolar simplification. In summary, this proposal employs novel quantitative imaging and genetic tools to study the poorly understood and unexpected role of AT1 cells in perinatal lung maturation, and represents a step toward our long term goal of elucidating mechanisms and therapies of lung immaturity."

The three project partners include: The University of Chicago's Game Changer Chicago Design Lab (GCC Lab); the Institute for Translational Medicine; and the Center for College Access and Success's (CCAS) GEAR UP program. The GCC Lab is an interdisciplinary game and research lab comprised of faculty, staff, students, and high school youth that design games aimed at improving academic achievement and optimizing the health and well-being of young people. GEAR UP aims to increase academic performance and preparation for post-secondary education among youth in partnering Chicago Public Schools. We will design an innovative game-based science and health curriculum intervention: Hexacago Health Academy (HHA). HHA will engage high school students in learning about and addressing major sexual and reproductive health issues and risk behaviors (e.g., STIs, HIV/AIDs, adolescent pregnancy, smoking). HHA will use game-play, interaction with STEM science and health professionals, and mentoring. The proposed SEPA project will have three phases: 1) Hexacago game design (years 1 and 2) and development of the HHA (year 3); 2) rigorous evaluation of HHA in a randomized controlled trial (years 4); and 3) Dissemination and communication (year 5). We hypothesize that youth randomized to HHA will have improved academic performance, science and health career interest compared to those randomized to the control group. The overall objective of this proposal is to create a rich, game-based learning experience to improve academic performance, science and health career interest, and health behaviors."
"9240680","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pathogenic aggregation of alpha-synuclein (alphaSyn) is increasingly implicated in familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD) and other human synucleinopathies. Based largely on studies of the recombinant protein, alphaSyn has long been defined as a natively unfolded monomer of 14 kD that is believed to acquire secondary (alpha- helical) structure only upon binding to certain lipid vesicles. In contrast, our lab discovered in 2011 that endogenous alphaSyn isolated under non-denaturing conditions from living human cells and neuronal lines occurs principally as a helically-folded tetramer of ~60 kD. Multiple methods, including sedimentation equilibrium analysis by analytical ultracentrifugation, scanning transmission electron microscopy, mass spectrometry and circular dichroism, established the existence of an alpha-helically folded tetramer. Not unexpectedly, this discovery engendered controversy, but we have recently completed an extensive analysis of living cells (including neurons) using in vivo crosslinking that has confirmed that the principa form of native alphaSyn in intact cells is a 60 kD tetramer. Also, 3 other labs recently provided evidence for the occurrence of alpha-helical oligomeric structures based on certain methods of preparing alphaSyn. If this finding that endogenous alphaSyn exists as a helically-folded tetramer can be further extended, it will have major implications for the biology of alphaSyn in health and disease, as the reviewers of our first version of this application recognized. A central concept of human neurodegenerative diseases -- that normally soluble proteins (alphaSyn, tau, Abeta, etc.) can misfold and aggregate into neurotoxic species - depends on understanding the normal state of the protein and what misfolding and aggregation actually mean. Accordingly, we propose an integrated series of entirely novel Specific Aims to characterize the dynamic relationship of the metastable alphaSyn tetramers to the unfolded monomer believed to be the native structure of alphaSyn since its description 20 years ago. Aim 1 Raise conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies to purified alphaSyn tetramers as key tools for all Aims. Aim 2 Examine the effects of four PD-causing missense mutations and certain structure-altering artificial mutations on the kinetic equilibrium of tetramers and monomers in intact cells. Aim 3 Study the biochemical mechanism and dynamics of the assembly of freshly synthesized monomers into tetramers (and other oligomers), their stability in the cell, and their subsequent disassembly. Aim 4 Purify endogenous human ?Syn from normal and diseased (DLB) brains to establish its structure and assembly state in the most disease-relevant organ; then, systematically analyze its biochemical properties. We have made major progress towards these Aims since our first submission (see Preliminary Data). Our work elucidates the dynamic relationship between metastable physiological (alpha-helical) oligomers, unfolded monomers, and abnormally folded (beta-sheet-rich) oligomers of ?Syn in human cells and brain, with attendant mechanistic and therapeutic implications for PD."
"9440666","Project Abstract Type 2 diabetes is the most common metabolic disease and affects nearly 10% of the American population. Given its close association with obesity, not only is the prevalence expected to increase in the future, but individuals with the disease are at a higher risk for developing severe health complications, including cardiovascular disease, which remains the leading cause of death for diabetic patients. Therefore, it is imperative that better treatment strategies are developed to manage the progression of the disease and its associated health risks. Many factors, both genetic and environmental, contribute to the manifestation of type 2 diabetes; however, the development of peripheral insulin resistance remains the strongest etiological predictor of disease progression. An abundance of scientific evidence suggests that chronic inflammation, particularly in the setting of obesity, promotes cellular insulin resistance. Specifically, pro-inflammatory cytokines are elevated in metabolic diseases and can inhibit insulin-dependent signaling pathways in tissue sites such as the liver. Recently, a unique link between a family of proteins known as the TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) and the development of insulin resistance has been developed. TRAF proteins are key mediators in cytokine signaling, but their role in the liver, particularly hepatocytes, are not well defined. Preliminary data suggests that one specific member, TRAF3, negatively regulates insulin sensitivity in primary hepatocytes as well as in transgenic mouse models by promoting the ubiquitination of insulin receptor substrates 1 and 2 (IRS1/2), which function as important adaptor proteins that facilitate insulin signaling transduction pathways in target cells. Therefore, the working hypothesis of this proposal is that hepatic TRAF3 expression directly promotes insulin resistance in the liver through altered ubiquitination of IRS1/2 adaptor proteins. To test this hypothesis, two aims have been developed. Aim 1 seeks to determine the mechanisms that drive hepatic TRAF3 induction in obesity. Preliminary data suggests that TRAF3 is up-regulated in mouse models of obesity. To determine the mechanisms by which this occurs, a variety of approaches, conducted in primary hepatocytes and mouse models, will be employed to investigate the roles of cytokines, free fatty acids, and lipopolysaccharide in promoting TRAF3 up-regulation in a Toll-like and TNF receptor-dependent fashion. Aim 2 seeks to determine the molecular mechanisms by which TRAF3 promotes insulin resistance. Specifically, TRAF3's role as a ubiquitin ligase will be the focus by using transgenic mouse strains, molecular biology and analytical chemistry techniques, such as mass spectrometry, to identify the sites of IRS1/2 ubiquitination and its functional outcome in the liver. Together, these studies will advance the scientific understanding of how inflammation and IR are linked, as well as provide novel approaches and strategies to treat type 2 diabetes and its associated complications."
"9214604","PROJECT SUMMARY Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a common, costly, heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder comprised of impairments related to social communication and interaction as well as restricted interests and repetitive behaviors. Social communication deficits are core to ASD with challenges in this domain often translating into serious lifespan impairment for most individuals. While certain behavioral and pharmacological interventions have some benefits to many children with ASD, such interventions often require significant time and effort- intensive burdens for implementation, suffer from low-adherence and limited availability in community settings, and ultimately have demonstrated weak transfer of skills to real world settings of meaning. While advances in technological capacity have the potential to yield intervention platforms of meaning, current technological systems have focused on simple discrete social skill development or required confederate or remote operation, limits which have impeded progress toward successful mainstream clinical use and benefit. In order to address these issues we propose to develop and test the feasibility, tolerability, and potential for clinical benefit of a novel technological paradigm for meaningful social communication that combines two innovative technologies: (1) collaborative virtual environments (CVE) and (2) artificially intelligent (AI) agent-based interactions to create a virtual intelligent system (VIS) for ASD intervention. We will design a VIS in which children with ASD will participate in a series of engaging game-like interactive tasks where they collaborate with peers and with artificially intelligent partners (AIP). We hypothesize that the proposed paradigm will preserve all advantages of a traditional CVE for meaningful interaction, but will allow unrestricted verbal communication with real partners and eliminate the need for manual coding by providing consistent unbiased measurements of meaningful aspects of social interaction. The proposed system will autonomously index both traditional markers of performance as well as social communicative behaviors contributing to task performance and attempt to modify tasks to meaningfully alter subsequent interactions. It is hypothesized that this measurement and intervention strategy, deployed across engaging, dynamic interactions highly relevant to real-world social interaction, will readily yield quantifiable metrics of important components of social communication that are potentially sensitive to change and responsive to intervention strategies. The specific aims of this project are: 1) Development of a virtual intelligent system and embedded artificially intelligent partners capable of dynamic meaningful interaction during collaborative game activities, and 2) Validation of feasibility and tolerability of the system with children and adolescents with ASD. The proposed technology is simple, cost-effective and is easy to translate for mainstream use."
"9314154","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In making the most important decisions for cancer care, clinicians naturally consider their patients' evolving characteristics and risks factors and tailor the treatments or diagnostic tests accordingly. In other words, they consider dynamic treatment strategies that depend on the evolution of one or more time-dependent covariates (e.g. functional status, frailty, new comorbidities) as opposed to static treatment strategies which do not. Despite the clinical relevance of dynamic treatment strategies, most research continues to compare static strategies. This is because, in part, randomized clinical trials comparing dynamic strategies can be particularly expensive, time-consuming, and inefficient. Additionally, observational studies of dynamic strategies require specific methods because even in the absence of unmeasured confounding, conventional estimates fail to have a causal interpretation when (i) there exists a measured time-varying prognostic factor that also predicts subsequent treatment, and (ii) past treatment predicts subsequent prognostic factor level. This treatment- confounder feedback is pervasive in biomedical research. This application's broad objective is to create an innovative research program that integrates data from diverse sources such as electronic medical records, administrative claims, epidemiologic cohorts (and in the future wearable health technology and patient portals) with advanced epidemiological methods to study dynamic strategies of health care delivery and create publicly available analytic tools to accelerate discovery and support a more strategic delivery of cancer care. The specific aims involve training in open-source programming, data science and advanced epidemiological methods. These skills will be used to develop three projects that will use different sources of data (a traditional epidemiological cohort, a linkage of tumor registries with claims and electronic medical records) to address questions on prevention, surveillance and treatment of cancer:  ? What is the best dynamic strategy for colorectal cancer screening?  ? What is the best dynamic strategy for bladder cancer surveillance?  ? What is the best dynamic strategy of treatment for prostate cancer patients with a PSA-only relapse? These projects will serve as a backbone to develop and fine tune the specific methods required to study dynamic strategies of health care delivery: the g-methods. Specifically, this application will focus on the application and dissemination of Marginal Structural Models and the parametric g-formula for clinical cancer research."

Major new initiatives aimed at accomplishing these goals include: 1) the establishment of a new network of research opportunities for undergraduates interested in the neurosciences, 2) the introduction of three interactive courses (The Teen Brain, Neuroscience Futures, and Skills for a Neuroscientist) to bolster neuroscience fundamentals and a sense of community among the students, 3) enhanced involvement of the undergraduates in the Society for Neuroscience Brain Bee as part of their training in science communication, and 4) refinement of a near peer-mentoring program that has graduate students working with undergraduates and undergraduates working with high school students. These initiatives will ensure our students remain at the forefront of developments in neuroscience research, teaching and outreach."
"9247259","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a fatal disease associated with focal atrophy of the prefrontal and anterior temporal cortex. FTD is the second most common cause of dementia under age 65 (after Alzheimer's disease), and there is no cure. Compared to other major neurodegenerative disorders, very little is known about its pathogenic basis at molecular, synaptic, and circuit levels. Behavioral abnormalities, characterized by marked changes in personality and social conduct are hallmarks of FTD. As many as 50% of FTD patients have a family history of the disease, suggesting a strong genetic component. Recent molecular genetic studies have identified a number of FTD-causing genes, including CHMP2B, progranulin (GRN), and C9ORF72, paving the way for in-depth investigation of pathogenic mechanisms of the disease. Interestingly, the clinical outcome in FTD patients carrying different mutations is often strikingly similar, suggesting that the same neural circuits are affected. In an effort to model FTD in animals and elucidate underlying mechanisms, we have generated a conditional transgenic mouse strain that expresses an FTD-causing CHMP2BIntron5 in the forebrain. Mutant mice recapitulate several key features of FTD-associated neurodegeneration phenotypes, including social behavioral impairments. Our studies uncover a marked change in AMPA receptor (AMPAR) composition, leading to abnormal insertion of Ca2+-impermeable AMPARs in synapses of the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC). This AMPAR dysregulation appears to be driven by a loss of the brain-enriched noncoding microRNA miR-124. Importantly, similar changes in miR-124 and AMPARs are also observed in the frontal cortex and iPSC-derived cortical neurons from a subset of patients with behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD). This suggests that miR-124 and AMPAR dysregulation are not limited to CHMP2BIntron5 mutation, and are perhaps a more general pathogenic mechanism for FTD with more common mutations. Based on these results, we propose a novel mechanism of FTD pathogenesis: altered synaptic AMPAR assembly and function in PFC circuits underline the social behavioral impairments in FTD. The goal of this application is to test and establish this AMPAR hypothesis of FTD. We will examine key AMPAR mechanisms and map affected circuits in the medial PFC in an existing (GRN haploinsufficiency) and two newly generated (CHMP2BIntron5 and C9ORF72 AAV transgenic mice with G4C2 repeat expansions) mouse models of FTD (Aim 1), establish the miR-124-AMPAR pathogenic axis and by manipulating this axis, especially CP-AMPARs, restore sociability deficits in mouse models in vivo (Aim 2), and finally, validate the AMPAR hypothesis and explore therapeutic strategies in human patient iPSC-derived cortical neurons harboring different genetic mutations (Aim 3). We will use a multidisciplinary approach combining in vivo gene manipulations, electrophysiology, mouse behavior, and human iPSC technologies. Our results will set the stage for translational studies aimed at developing an AMPAR-based therapeutic strategy for FTD."
"9292934","PROJECT SUMMARY  The primary cilium, an antenna-like structure on the surface of most quiescent and differentiated cells, is essential for transducing signals required for growth control, including Hedgehog (Hh) signals. Consequently, loss of cilia alters responsiveness to extracellular cues. Many cancers, including breast cancer, exhibit near- complete loss of cilia during the early stages of oncogenic transformation. Novel strategies are urgently needed to treat the most lethal sub-type, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is disproportionately observed in African-Americans and thus represents a key health disparity. We propose that restoring ciliogenesis to breast cancer cells will restore growth suppressive signaling and block tumor growth.  Our preliminary data indicate that (1) cancer cells can regrow cilia; (2) single gene or pharmacological intervention can cause cancer cells to regrow cilia; and (3) ciliary regrowth inhibits proliferation. We will build on these findings by conducting an innovative functional screen to identify the genes that restrict ciliogenesis in breast cancer cells, and test whether restoring ciliogenesis limits tumor growth in vivo. The identified ciliogenesis inhibitors will help unravel the molecular mechanisms by which cancer cells suppress ciliogenesis, identify how cilia inhibit breast cell proliferation, and test, for the first time, whether reversing the loss of cilium-associated signaling restores growth regulation to transformed breast cancer cells.  In Aim 1, we will perform a novel genome-wide screen to identify inhibitors of ciliogenesis in breast cancer. Prior screens have identified regulators that promote ciliogenesis. In contrast, our screen will identify negative regulators of cilium assembly. We will also test the innovative hypothesis that restoration of cilia in combination with use of clinically relevant inhibitors of ciliary signaling can block tumor growth. In Aim 2, we will test how restoring ciliogenesis impacts breast cancer growth in animal models. Together, these studies will reveal how cancer cells restrict ciliogenesis, an important, unanswered question in cancer cell biology. The successful demonstration that restoring ciliogenesis inhibits tumor growth will reveal a novel strategy for targeting breast cancer, which may be applicable to other cancer types. By taking advantage of the complementary strengths of the Dynlacht and Reiter laboratories, we will innovatively combine RNAi screening, state-of-the-art ciliary analysis, and organismal cancer modeling. While highly exploratory, in keeping with the R21 mechanism, discovering the means to promote ciliogenesis and restrain breast cancer growth will identify novel ways that tumors avoid growth control and may establish a novel paradigm for treating breast cancer. Furthermore, to address cancer health disparities, we will: (1) begin to lay the mechanistic foundation for understanding why TNBC disproportionately affects African-Americans and (2) acquire and characterize primary TNBC samples to determine whether tumor ciliation or expression of regulators of ciliogenesis differs in different ethnic populations. !"

"9220858","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Statistical comparison of neuroimaging data often requires large databases to produce reliable outcomes. However, in medical imaging studies, databases are usually small due to the dif?culty in recruiting patients and volunteers. Samples are even more limited when parameters such as age or gender must be matched between healthy controls and patients. In situations as such, conventional statistical tests may become erroneous and generate either false positive or false negative detections. In addition, automatic image comparison approaches typically require a common reference frame that is often constructed from scans of healthy subjects by means of non-linear registration. However, registration methods are not perfect and may be prone to errors due to noise, artifacts, and complex variations in brain topology. Registration errors introduce structural variability that wil decrease the statistical power in detecting real meaningful differences. The objective of this project is to create a set of novel computational tools for robust statistical analysis of diffusio magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, particularly in situations where samples are noisy, limited, and exhibit complex shape variations. We propose three aims to achieve this objective. In Aim 1, we will devise a technique that will drastically increase the number of available samples for the estimation of diffusion statistics and their variability. This is achieved by identifying and agglomerating repetitive local information throughout an image to signi?cantly increase sample size for improving estimation. We will further develop statistical techniques that will utilize these `repeated samples' for resampling- based non-parametric estimation of the variability of statistics of interest. In Aim 2, we will develop methods for effective and robust group and individual comparisons of diffusion statistics using a limited number of samples. This is achieved by explicitly correcting for registration errors via a block matching mechanism to ensure that comparisons are performed only between matching structures. Since variability due to registration errors are minimized, our method will signi?cantly increase statistical power in detecting abnormalities. In addition, similar to Aim 1, our method will allow comparisons to be performed without imposing a priori, but often unrealistic, assumption on the distribution of the statistic of interest. In Aim 3, extensive evaluations of the methods developed in Aim 1 and Aim 2 will be carried out using databases associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. If successful, the statistical computational tools developed in this project will increase the statistical power of studies involving smaller databases and will allow detection of smaller effect sizes in studies with moderately-sized databases."
"9332208","Project Summary/Abstract Migraine is a complex and debilitating neurological disorder involving the neuropeptide calcitonin gene- related peptide (CGRP). The overall objective of this project is to identify mechanisms by which peripheral CGRP causes photophobia, a painful response to non-noxious levels of light experienced by ~90% of migraine patients. Peripheral injection of CGRP causes light aversion, a response analogous to photophobia. This response in wild-type requires bright light, while in transgenic mice with globally increased CGRP receptors there is an enhanced response seen even in dim light. Interestingly, this enhanced light aversive phenotype is not seen in transgenic mice that have elevated nervous system expression of the receptor. This evidence suggests that peripheral CGRP administration may cause light aversion and activate neural pathways in an indirect mechanism. Since CGRP is one of the most potent vasodilators in the body, we hypothesize that CGRP can cause light aversion by a vascular mechanism. This hypothesis is based on findings that 1) intravenous administration of CGRP in human subjects can cause migraine pain, and 2) perivascular CGRP can sensitize the trigeminal nerve, which could alter synaptic transmission to the central nervous system. Thus, there is a mechanism by which CGRP in the periphery can sensitize the trigeminal nerve and alter sensory perception, leading to photophobia. A single aim is proposed that will establish the contribution of the vasculature in light aversive behavior. Complementary pharmacological and genetic strategies will be used. The pharmacological approach will be to co-administer a vasoconstrictor to minimize CGRP-induced vasodilation. The genetic approach will be to generate transgenic mice with conditional overexpression of CGRP receptors on endothelial and smooth muscle cells of the vasculature. This aim will provide insight into the mechanisms by which peripheral CGRP can trigger a migraine-like symptom in a preclinical mouse model of migraine."
"9319576","PROJECT SUMMARY  The mechanisms underlying tendon development are by far the least understood of any component of the musculoskeletal system. This is a concern because tendon injuries are common and treatment options are limited. Healing often results in formation of scar tissue, which is compositionally and mechanically inferior to native tendon, resulting in decreased flexibility and a high recurrent tear rate. Members of the CCN family of matricellular proteins have been extensively studied due to their key roles in multiple fibrotic conditions, but their roles in normal fibrous tissues like tendons are unknown. We found that CCN1/Cyr61 s highly expressed in tendon and ligament, and that mice in which Ccn1 is ablated in tendon/ligament progenitor stem cells (TPSCs) using Scx-Cre (Ccn1SKO) exhibit a clubfoot-like phenotype. Histological analysis revealed that anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), Achilles and patellar tendons are substantially thicker and more stout than in wild-type (WT) littermates at birth; these defects persist in adults. The affected tendon displays stronger mechanical properties early, but becomes significantly weaker with age. No other mutants with a similar phenotype have been described to date. Initial RNA-Seq and phenotypic analysis revealed that affected tendons in Ccn1SKO mice acquire a gene expression profile similar to that of activated wound fibroblasts. We therefore have a unique opportunity to identify new mechanisms regulating tendon formation and remodeling that have direct therapeutic potential. We plan to: 1) define the function of CCN1/Cyr61 in tendon formation and maintenance in vivo through phenotypic analysis of Ccn1SKO mice, and 2) test the hypothesis that CCN1/Cyr61 is required in TPSCs/tenocytes to promote the tenogenic phenotype and prevent acquisition of an activated wound fibroblast fate. Success with these studies would provide a strong rationale for future studies that evaluate the function of CCN1/Cyr61 in tendon injury/repair and develop CCN1/Cyr61 as a therapeutic agent to promote scarless tendon healing."
"9235147","?    DESCRIPTION: The undesired destruction of healthy cells by the immune system results in the loss of tissue function and complicates strategies to restore tissue function. The current standard therapy for autoimmune disease involves generalized immunosuppression, which is in most cases is not clinically efficacious and leads to numerous undesired side effects. Dr. Stephen Miller, (co-PI) pioneered an approach in which splenocytes were cross-linked with specific auto antigens, and their delivery to the spleen induced tolerance specifically to the auto antigen. This approach was recently adapted for a clinical trial in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, and was the first-in-man study to report the induction antigen specific tolerance. However, the use of cellular carriers for tolerance induction in the clinical arena is challenging due to the considerable ex-vivo laboratory manipulation that is required, which is expensive, increases the number of donor cells needed and introduces further opportunity for technical error. Our long-term goal is to develop a particle-based platform that can be an off-the-shelf product for induction of tolerance to specific antigens to inhibit the specific undesired immune response while not altering the remaining elements of the immune response. We have demonstrated that antigen-loaded particles delivered intravenously can induce tolerance for the prevention and treatment of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the mouse model of MS. With the goal of moving this technology toward the clinic, we propose to extend these studies to address fundamental questions about the particle design and their mechanisms of action, and also critical questions regarding the ability to target the variety of antigens and  cell populations underlying disease. Specific Aim 1 will investigate the particle design parameters and identify the cellular mechanisms by which particles injected intravenously are able to modulate inflammation and induce antigen specific tolerance. Our results suggest the liver as a critical site involved in tolerance induction from the particles, which distinguishes it from the previous work with antigen-coupled splenocytes. We propose to investigate the particle composition and size to distinguish i) the impact of the carrier on immune cell polarization, ii) te efficacy of antigen presentation, and iii) in vivo trafficking of the particles. Specific Aim 2 wil determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which Ag-PLG tolerance is induced and maintained in naïve, activated, and memory T cells. We propose to test the ability to induce tolerance with particles encapsulating multiple peptides/proteins and to examine the separate and combined contributions of anergy and Tregs to the induction and maintenance of tolerance. Successful completion of these studies would identify particles that are novel, safe, efficient and clinically relevant tools to inhibit antigen-specific T-cells for therapy of autoimmune diseases. This innovative approach has far reaching implications for decreasing specific immune responses in applications such as autoimmune disease, rejection of transplanted cells, and allergies to food antigens or airborne particulates."
"9316785","PROJECT SUMMARY The overarching theme of this HIVRAD proposal is to utilize the SHIV/rhesus macaque (RM) model to understand the virus-antibody coevolutionary pathways leading to the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs), and then to translate what we learn into the design of an effective HIV-1 vaccine. SHIVs that have been generated in the Shaw laboratory have been pre-selected as good candidates for V1V2 or V3 glycan bNAb induction; they will enable systematic and rigorous characterization of the evolutionary pathways to bNAb breadth taken by different Envs in RMs and humans. We will characterize what is common, versus what is distinctive, in bNAb development and HIV-1 Envelope (Env) evolution between human and rhesus macaques (RMs), as well as between different RMs infected by the same SHIV. Our preliminary work shows that in at least some cases, we can expect evolutionary pathways to coincide. In Core C, we will use bioinformatics and analytical and statistical tools to map the extent to which Env and antibody (Ab) co- evolutionary pathways are shared between hosts in early infection and throughout the course of SHIV infections as neutralization breadth emerges. We will begin by testing for patterns of immunologically relevant mutations in both the Ab lineages and Env quasispecies as they co-evolve. We will help in down-selection of specific Envs and Abs from large sequence sets to provide a rational means of reagent selection for cloning and immunological characterization. We will provide statistical comparisons of immune response data, linking experimental immunological data to both Env and antibody sequence data, and perform signature analysis to resolve which mutations are critical in terms of changing the immunological phenotype of a protein (e.g. antibody sensitivity). This will provide data needed to make an informed selection regarding which Env candidates to take forward as vaccine immunogens. We will use computational methods to help resolve the B cell clonal activities that are contributing to polyclonal serological responses. We will help design polyvalent sets of Env vaccines for a lineage-based approach. Finally, we will provide statistical support throughout the project, including comparisons of vaccine group outcomes, and, if protection is observed, we will help define the correlates of immune protection. We will deposit sequences with linked meta-data to relevant databases upon publication, and make novel code written for this project publicly available."
"9322071","PROJECT SUMMARY Each year, approximately 8 million children under the age of five die, and approximately 3.3 million of those deaths occur in the neonatal period. Infections are the single largest contributor to these deaths, accounting for an estimated 36% of the mortality. However, our understanding of how the neonatal and infant immune system influence this susceptibility to infectious diseases is limited. Thus, to elucidate mechanisms that regulate the development of infant immunity, we propose evaluating immune development in a setting of high risk of neonatal and infant infection. In particular, infants who are exposed to HIV, yet remain uninfected, suffer increased rates of respiratory and diarrheal illnesses. Feeding status is also associated with altered risk of infection, with exclusively breastfed children less likely to suffer diarrheal illness and death. Our preliminary data suggest that both HIV exposure and feeding status influence the infant microbiome, which is increasingly recognized for its important role in driving immune development. Thus, to better understand the unique characteristics of immune development in neonates and infants, we propose evaluating the impact of HIV exposure and feeding status on the interplay between the microbiome, innate and adaptive cellular immune ontogeny, and vaccination outcomes. Our preliminary data also suggests that HIV exposure leads to oligoclonality in the T cell repertoire, potentially narrowing the spectrum of antigens to which infant T cells can respond. We have also found that HIV infection increases natural killer (NK) cell diversity while decreasing NK cell cytotoxic function. Using longitudinal samples collected from HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) and HIV- unexposed (HU) babies in an area of extremely high HIV prevalence in South Africa, we will: 1) compare the T and NK cell repertoires and function between HEU and HU babies, 2) determine the impact of maternal HIV, feeding status, gut and breastmilk microbiome on the infant mucosal microbiome, and 3) build a predictive model of effective pertussis and rotavirus vaccines to identify the major factors that associate with vaccine success or failure. This study will provide a comprehensive understanding of how cellular immune responses and the microbiome evolve in the first year of life and influence the ability to generate an effective cellular and humoral immune responses."
"9239916","ABSTRACT. Stigma and discrimination relating to HIV/AIDS (?HIV-related stigma?) interfere with seeking and receiving appropriate treatment and care, contribute to depression, lower quality of life and other psychiatric disorders, and produce worsening clinical outcomes among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH). Despite global efforts to tackle HIV-related stigma for decades, HIV stigma remains a critical public health issue in US and globally, particularly in low and middle income countries including China. There are substantial knowledge gaps in our understanding of HIV-related stigma and underlying mechanisms through which the stigma negatively affected clinical outcomes of PLWH. Research has suggested both biological mechanism (e.g., increasing stress- related hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal [HPA] activity) and behavioral mechanism (e.g., decreasing adherence to treatment and care) through which stigma may negatively impact clinical outcomes (e.g., CD4 counts, viral load, disease progression). However, these possible biological and behavioral mechanisms, while hypothesized, have not been empirically tested in longitudinal studies. In this US-China collaborative research project, investigators from University of South Carolina (USC) and Guangxi Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Guangxi CDC) propose a longitudinal epidemiological assessment among a cohort of 1,200 PLWH in Guangxi China where we have built a strong research infrastructure and community collaboration through NIH-funded research since 2004. The primary outcomes will be HIV clinical outcomes (CD4 count, viral load, disease progression) and the intermediate outcomes will include chronic stress response and adherence to treatment and care. In addition to self-reported data (e.g., depression and anxiety, adherence to treatment and care), biomarkers of stress (hair cortisol) and ART adherence (hair antiretroviral concentration) will be employed. The proposed research is designed to address one of the priority HIV/AIDS topic areas in RFA-AI-16-006 (i.e., ??studies focusing on reducing health disparities in the incidences of new HIV infections or in treatment outcomes of people living with HIV/AIDS?) and stimulate further collaborative research between US and Chinese investigators in the areas of HIV-related stigma and health disparities in treatment outcomes of PLWH."
"9417149","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Zona incerta (ZI) of the diencephalon has extensive connections with other brain regions and has been involved in several functions such as controlling visceral activity, thermoregulation, arousal and locomotor activity. In spite of its important functions it is one of the most understudied regions of the brain and no studies of the cellular and synaptic electrophysiological properties of ZI neurons have been reported so far. Maintenance of body temperature is central to energy homeostasis in mammals because it represents a major part of the energy expenditure of the organism. It is controlled by neurons of the preoptic area/ anterior hypothalamus (PO/AH) that project directly or indirectly to the rostral raphe pallidus. Anatomical and functional evidence clearly indicate a projection from the preoptic area, the thermoregulatory center, to ZI neurons. Combined retrograde labeling/immunostaining experiments have revealed that preoptic neurons projecting to ZI are peptidergic. ZI neurons project to the raphe pallidus and thus they can represent a relay of the preoptic thermogenic output to the brainstem neurons controlling thermoeffector processes. Our overarching hypothesis is that ZI GABAergic neurons mediate the peptidergic modulation of thermoregulation by PO/AH neurons. Preliminary data indicate that ZI neurons express receptors for these neuropeptides. We have also found that thermoregulatory neuropeptides excite ZI GABAergic neurons by activating inward currents and that they increase intracellular Ca concentrations. Our preliminary data also show that preoptic neurons projecting to ZI GABAergic neurons are peptidergic. Using transgenic models and telemetry we plan to study the role of ZI neurons in mediating the modulation of thermoregulation by neuropeptides (Sp Aim 1). We plan to identify thermoregulatory ZI neurons in slices and study their firing and synaptic characteristics as well as their modulation by neuropeptides involved in thermoregulation, followed by single cell RT/PCR analysis to determine the expression patterns for these receptors (Sp. Aim 2). By employing pharmacological tools, Ca imaging, electrophysiology and transgenic models we will then study the signaling pathways and the ion conductances involved in the neuropeptides' actions on ZI neurons (Sp. Aim 3). In summary in this study we will address fundamental and unexplored aspects of neural control of thermoregulation."
"9251904","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In response to pro-atherosclerotic factors such as oxidized lipids, or to therapeutic interventions such as angioplasty, stents, or bypass surgery, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) migrate to the intima, resulting in intimal hyperplasia, restenosis, graft failure, or atherosclerosis. Understanding the mechanisms involved in VSMC migration has been a major focus of biomedical research. Our exciting preliminary data show that in response to or wire-mediated carotid artery injury, increased expression of autophagy-related (Atg) proteins is associated with increased VSMC migration and intimal hyperplasia. Pharmacological and genetic suppression of autophagy inhibits VSMC migration. Mechanistically, suppression of vascular autophagy leads to the accumulation of amino acid synthesis protein 5 (GCN5), a ubiquitous histone acetyltransferase (HAT) that promotes transcriptional activation. Furthermore, we found that GCN5 accumulation is associated with increased ?-tubulin acetylation, microtubule stabilization, and inhibition of VSMC migration. The central hypothesis is that autophagy-dependent degradation of GCN5 promotes VSMC migration via inhibition of ?-tubulin acetylation. This hypothesis will be tested using gain-/lossof-function strategies in both animal models and cultured cells. Aim 1 will determine the role of autophagy in regulating VSMC migration in response to vascular injury in vivo by characterizing the spatial and temporal dynamics of vascular autophagy, VSMC migration, and neointimal hyperplasia using smMHC/eGFP transgenic mice, determining whether autophagy deficiency inhibits VSMC migration and neointimal formation in response to carotid ligation and/or vascular injury using Beclin1 heterozygous mice (beclin1+/-), and examining whether enhanced VSMC autophagy promotes VSMC migration and exacerbates neointimal hyperplasia and atherosclerosis in response to vascular injury in Atg7 SMC-specific transgenic mice (Atg-TG). In addition, the role of autophagy in regulating VSMC migration will be determined using gain- and loss-of-function approaches in cultured aortic rings and VSMCs. Aim 2 is to delineate the mechanism by which autophagy promotes VSMC migration. By test the hypothesis that autophagy promotes VSMC migration by enhancing GCN5 degradation and reducing ?-tubulin acetylation. The proposed study will characterize the molecular mechanism by which autophagy degrades GCN5 in VSMCs, examine whether GCN5 acetylates ?-tubulin and stabilizes microtubules, and determine whether autophagy suppression inhibits VSMC migration by increasing GCN5-mediated acetylation of ?-tubulin in beclin+/- mice of wire-mediated carotid artery injury, carotid ligation, and atherosclerosis, and Apoe-/-/beclin1+/- mice fed with a high-ft diet."
"9281063","PROJECT SUMMARY An underappreciated aspect of myelination is the avoidance of selecting non-axonal targets. Oligodendrocytes (OLs) select axons while avoiding neuronal somata, dendrites and processes of other glial cells. How is this specificity accomplished? While OLs are capable of myelinating permissive structures (artificial fibers and beads) in the absence of molecular cues, structurally permissive neuronal somata and dendrites remain unmyelinated. These observations suggest that myelin substrate selection is not cell-intrinsically limited to physiologically relevant geometries. OL cell processes are likely sensitive to cell-extrinsic cues that ensure the selection of axons with high fidelity. Utilizing a novel purified spinal cord neuron-OL myelinating coculture system we find that disruption of dynamic neuron-OL signaling by chemical crosslinking results in aberrant myelination of the somatodendritic compartment of neurons. In this proposal, we hypothesize that inhibitory somatodendritic cues act as repulsive membrane signals that are necessary and sufficient to prevent non-axonal myelination. In this proposal we will: 1. Perform next-generation sequencing and candidate profiling of membrane proteins expressed exclusively in purified spinal cord neurons. 2. Identify, confirm and validate expression and localization of repulsive membrane proteins enriched in the somatodendritic compartment. 3. Investigate the necessity and sufficiency of the repulsive signal(s) to prevent aberrant myelination and identify receptor(s) on OPCs that mediate the inhibition. Our preliminary data identifies the Junctional Adhesion Molecule 2 (JAM2), expressed on the somata and dendrites of spinal cord neurons, as a repulsive signal that inhibits aberrant oligodendrocyte myelination. Taken together, we propose a model in which broadly indiscriminate myelination is tailored by inhibitory signaling to meet local myelination requirements."
"9238503","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Much mental health research uses neurophysiological measurements to describe the way neural activity within and across brain regions is related to behavioral function and dysfunction. One kind of signal, known as spike trains, comes from individual neurons. Other signals, including local field potentials (LFPs), electroencephalography (EEGs), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are based on activity from large numbers of neurons within specified parts of the brain. With all of these sources of data, scientifically rigorous statistical analysis must accommodate unstable fluctuations, associated with movement or thought, known in statistics as non-stationary. The continuing research program of this grant is to develop methods for analyzing non-stationary neural data. The number of neural signals that can be recorded simultaneously has been increasing rapidly. Because neural network dysfunction is widely considered to be associated with psychopathology, improvements in recording technologies offer exciting opportunities. They also create big statistical challenges due to greatly increased complexity. The research in this grant aims to provide methods for analyzing the ways that network structure may change with particular variables, including those that help characterize behavior, which involves the transmission of neural information at multiple timescales. Fast timescales include oscillations and neural synchrony, which could provide an essential mechanism of neural network information flow and may be a marker that distinguishes normal from diseased states. At slower timescales there is considerable redundancy in the recorded signals, which suggests dimensionality reduction. New methods investigated in this research program can accommodate both faster and slower timescales, and they can also accommodate relationships arising from the spatial configuration of electrodes that record neural signals. These methods are tailored to handle spike trains, LFP, and MEG data, especially as they might arise in experiments related to mental health research. Because a neural spike train is a set of times at which a neuron fired, it is common to consider it to be a point process, which is the statistical model set up to handle sequences of event times. The research supported by this grant concerns development and investigation of statistical techniques involving both multi-dimensional continuous time series (for LFP, EEG, and MEG data) and multi-dimensional point processes (for spike trains)."
"9260048","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The regenerative capacity of airway epithelium in response to injury is critical for lung recovery from environmental insults and preventing the progression of respiratory diseases. So it is important to understand how epithelial regeneration is regulated to potentially enhance recovery and reduce lung injury. MicroRNAs and Hippo pathway have emerged as key modulators of both organ development and adult tissue repair and regeneration. We recently demonstrated that the microRNA cluster, miR302-367, promotes a high level of cell proliferation but less differentiated phenotype in the developing lung and heart. Overexpression of miR302-367 in adult heart promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation and cardiac regeneration. MiR302-367 functions, in part, by targeting several components of the Hippo signaling pathway, which negatively regulates the activity of Yap and Taz. Yap and Taz are key transcriptional co-activators that drive the expression of their downstream targets to promote cell proliferation and inhibit cell death. We have explored the mechanisms that regulate alveolar epithelial repair and regeneration in adult lung following injury induced by bacterial pneumonia. Bacterial pneumonia remains a leading cause of mortality in children and the elderly. While extensive studies have focused on bacterial virulence and host immune responses, little is known about the type lung injury induced by bacterial pneumonia and their subsequent regeneration and repair. We show that mice with infection of Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp) have markedly injuries in the lung parenchyma followed by visible repair and regeneration. In response to Sp-induced injury, pre-existing SPC-expressing epithelial type II cells in the alveolus function as epithelial progenitor cells. They proliferate and differentiate ito type I cell at the sites of affected alveolar region. Notably, the expression of miR302-367 and Yap/Taz target, Cysteine rich protein 61, is increased in distal lung epithelium. Overexpression of miRNA302-367 in SPC- expressing cells enhanced alveolar epithelial repair and regeneration. Administration of small molecule miR302-mimics in mice with bacterial pneumonia promoted distal airway epithelial regeneration, enhanced mouse recovery and survival. Based on these preliminary studies, we hypothesize that miR302-367 and Hippo pathway regulate lung epithelial gene transcription to promote epithelial repair and regeneration. Targeting microRNA-Hippo pathway may represent a novel therapeutic approach to promote recovery from injury induced by bacterial pneumonia. This project aims to define the mechanistic role of miR302-367 and Hippo signaling in distal airway epithelial repair and regeneration by (1) modulating miR302-367 and Yap/Taz expression in alveolar epithelial progenitor cells in murine model system, and (2) by defining the interactions of miR302-367 and Hippo signaling in governing gene network that control alveolar epithelial repair and regeneration, and (3) by examining the therapeutic potentials of miR-mimics and inhibiting Hippo pathway in recovery from bacteria-induced injury."

"9240586","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Enteric pathogens infect their human host via the gastrointestinal tract causing significant morbidity, mortality,  and economic hardship worldwide. The intestine is a complex organ comprised of a layer of epithelial cells, the  lamina propria containing immune cells, and a layer of smooth muscle cells organized into villi and crypts.  Currently available in vitro models of the human intestine have major limitations, e.g., lack of immune cells or  microbiota, and therefore, understanding how human enteric pathogens behave in their native host  environment has presented significant challenges. Systems more closely mimicking the human intestine are  needed to gain a better understanding of intestinal diseases, host - pathogen interactions and to facilitate the  development of more effective therapies. Recent studies revealed that primary human pluripotent stem cells  can be differentiated in vitro into three-dimensional human intestinal organoids (HIOs) with a pseudo-lumen  and polarized intestinal epithelium similar to the organization found in the intestine in vivo. Importantly, HIOs  contain the major secretory and absorptive cell types of the intestinal epithelium. However, HIOs lack microfold  (M) cells and immune cells, which are critical for induction of mucosal immunity and balancing of appropriate  tolerogenic and/or inflammatory responses to food antigens, commensal bacteria and pathogens. Imbalances  in intestinal homeostasis result in devastating diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and M cells  are important targets for improving oral vaccine efficacy. Therefore, the goal of Project 2 is to develop immune  HIOs containing M cells and immune cells. We hypothesize that immune HIOs, i.e., HIOs co-cultured with  immune cells, will more faithfully mimic the human intestine than current models and thus will be  superior for studying host-pathogen interactions, drug development and disease pathogenesis. To  develop complex human intestinal organoids with immune cells, we will: 1) establish and benchmark a complex  organoid model by co-culturing immune cells with HIOs (immune HIOs); 2) determine the response of the  complex organoid model to infection with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Clostridium difficile and  human norovirus; and 3) determine the suitability of immune HIOs with IBD-associated mutations to model  aspects of disease pathogenesis. The effects of microbiota-derived products on the function of immune HIOs  will also be evaluated. Our studies will synergize with Project 1, which will elucidate the interactions of HIOs  with commensal or pathogenic bacteria in the absence of immune cells, and with Project 3, which will engineer  a platform for the HIOs to allow intra- and extra-luminal flow and sampling. Our proposed research is  significant because it is expected to provide a novel system to facilitate studies of intestinal dysfunction. The  immune HIO model has the potential to fast-track development of effective vaccines, anti-infectives and  treatment options for intestinal diseases like IBD. "
"9213097","PROJECT SUMMARY Our understanding of natural selection in humans has been limited to indirect statistical inferences and experiments in distantly related model organisms or in cell lines. We propose a new approach: to identify loci that currently affect survival to a given age (i.e., viability), by mining the huge biomedical data sets now available. Our idea is to look for variants and sets of variants that change frequency over birth cohorts and generations more than expected by chance. Aim 1: We will identify variants that impact survival using genetic data from large cohort studies. We plan to examine changes in allele frequencies across birth cohorts, in >1 million individuals genotyped or resequenced genome-wide, starting with >200,000 genotypes from GERA and the UK Biobank. Controlling for population structure, we will assess (i) if allele or genotype frequencies change more with age than expected by chance; (ii) if the trends differ by sex; and (iii) if there is evidence for a trade-off between effects at young and old ages. We will perform these tests for single loci throughout the genome, as well as all loci in a given annotation (e.g., putatively damaging amino acid mutations). To examine current selection pressures on quantitative traits, we will consider sets of variants previously associated with over 40 quantitative traits (e.g., diabetes risk or height) and ask how the polygenic score for each varies with age and sex. Aim 2: We will identify variants that influence survival to adulthood or transmission odds in trio data. We propose to test for the unequal transmission of alleles from heterozygous parents to surviving children or young adults in >35,000 trios that have been genotyped or resequenced genome-wide. This data set provides high power to detect even moderate effects of selection acting early on in life (at haploid or diploid life stages) and subtle cases of meiotic drive. We will consider males and females separately as well as jointly, testing for distortion at each SNP and each haplotype block. We will also examine sets of loci that contribute to the same quantitative phenotype. Aim 3: We will relate current genetic variation to long-term selection pressures. By extending a statistical model that we recently developed, we will assess whether the set of variants that influences susceptibility to a given disease or anthropomorphic trait is enriched for signatures of positive, negative or balancing selection. This approach will allow us to ask: (i) Which selective pressures, if any, have influenced any of over 40 quantitative phenotypes for which we have collated mapping results; and (ii) Whether loci that currently affect development and aging (identified in Aims 1 and 2) show signals of balancing or purifying selection. In a separate analysis, we will examine which quantitative traits have contributed to local adaptation since human populations split. This research will help to identify variation that influences development and aging, aiding in individual prognosis and the understanding of disease genetics. Moreover, it will provide the first well-powered, comprehensive look at viability selection in extant humans and its relationship to long-term selective pressures."
"9233178","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality after lung transplantation. Recent data indicate participation of a few specific pathways in acute lung injury models and post-transplant PGD. A better understanding of these specific pathways would offer mechanistic clues to PGD pathogenesis and potentially stimulate investigation of novel therapeutic avenues. In addition, identification o specific, individualized risk factors for PGD might allow future personalized therapy. Our preliminary data indicate that among the top genes identified as having the largest fold differences in PGD compared to control, ANGPT2 a key mediator of vascular inflammation/ permeability demonstrated a 7-fold increase in donors pre- procurement which further increased an additional 10-fold post reperfusion. Given the up-regulation of ANGPT2 gene expression in our transplant cohort prior to harvest, there appears to be unmeasured injury to the lung despite normal physiologic measurements which needs to be further characterized. The long-term objective of our line of research is to understand the mechanism of PGD in human lung transplantation in order to identify strategies to identify donors at risk, prevent recipient death and potentially expand the donor pool through better donor selection and use of ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) strategies. Our approach is to use gene expression in donor lung biopsies to predict PGD, and to examine specific inflammatory, innate immunity and vascular permeability pathways involved in PGD of transplanted donors and untransplantable donors placed on EVLP. The central hypotheses are that lung injury occurring in the donor lung prior to reperfusion can be evaluated by gene expression methods to determine PGD risk, identify low risk organs that would have been discarded that can be transplanted, and understand common mechanisms of PGD and recovery on EVLP. Completion of this project will provide the candidate with advanced training and critical experience in cohort study design and conduct; tailoring genetic analysis at the gene, expression and pathway level; and applying advanced bioinformatic and computational techniques for pathways analysis and risk prediction. The candidate has assembled a rich mentoring committee spanning expertise in patient-oriented research, molecular and genetic epidemiology, genomics, bioinformatics, and molecular biology. In addition, he is taking advantage of Penn's outstanding educational opportunities through a Master's in Clinical Epidemiology. The proposal maps a clear plan to allow the candidate to become an independent clinical investigator in patient-oriented translational research."
"9258968","ABSTRACT A genetic haplotype, consisting of two amino acid substitutions, in the gene encoding complement factor H (CFH) significantly increases the risk for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of blindness in developed countries. The role of CFH, and in particular its AMD-linked haplotype in the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying AMD pathogenesis remains largely unknown. This project proposes to utilize CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to establish stable cell lines of human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), expressing genetic variants of CFH, including the AMD-linked variant. Given that the RPE is a major source of CFH in the retina, and has been reported to be a primary site of insult in AMD, these RPE cell lines will serve as a valid in vitro model to test the central hypothesis that the AMD-linked haplotype compromises CFH?s function and, ultimately, results in an RPE phenotype. Specifically, the model will be used to test the role of CFH in several homeostatic functions and events in the RPE, including barrier function, tolerance to oxidative stress, degradation of photoreceptor outer segments (POS), and formation of sub-RPE deposits. Sensitive live- cell assays, including four-dimensional live-cell imaging and transepithelial resistance measurement, will be used to test POS degradation and barrier function, respectively. In summary, this project will address key questions in human RPE cell biology ? (1) Does the AMD-linked haplotype of CFH compromise its function in the RPE? (2) What RPE cellular phenotypes result from compromised CFH function? (3) What endogenous role does CFH plays in maintaining RPE homeostasis?"
"9401511","?    DESCRIPTION:  The objective of this project is to study the analytical performance benefits of nitric oxide (NO)-releasing percutaneously implanted glucose sensors in a diabetic swine model as a function of NO-release duration. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices with superior usability (i.e., for immediate use and extended duration) would greatly increase the ability of those afflicted with diabetes to successfully manage their disease. We have demonstrated in a non-diabetic (i.e., healthy) swine model that NO- releasing sensor membranes both lessen the FBR and facilitate improved analytical sensor performance up to 10 days-the longest duration evaluated. However, CGM devices are intended for diabetic use and longer implantation periods would improve device utility/value. The variance in FBR and in vivo sensor performance among healthy and diabetic subjects is currently unknown but likely large due to impaired physiology and lower endogenous NO production. We hypothesize that the improvements in FBR and sensor performance that we have observed via exogenous (i.e., polymeric) NO release in healthy animals will be even greater in diabetic subjects. Through our work, we will study the influence of extended NO release on tissue biocompatibility and sensor performance as a function of diabetes. In this respect, we will generate new knowledge on how diabetes influences the FBR and in vivo sensor performance."
"9347152","PROJECT SUMMARY Malignant melanoma is one of the most aggressive types of skin cancer, causing a large majority of skin-cancer related deaths worldwide. Recently, there have been staggering breakthroughs with the advent of drugs that act on checkpoint inhibitors. These are paradigm- shifting immunotherapeutic agents not only for melanoma, but for cancers in general, because they harness the body's innate ability to target and destroy malignant cells. The original FDA approval for anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 therapies for melanoma contributed to better patient outcomes. The recent FDA approval for their combination for metastatic melanoma showed that attacking cancers through dual pathways led to better efficacy than with any single agent alone. Although promising, the incidence of high-grade immune-related adverse events (irAEs) due to the combination therapy is over 50%. Therefore, there is a pressing clinical need to develop therapeutic agents that may enhance the therapeutic effect of anti-PD1 therapy without significantly increasing toxicity in cancer patients. Resiquimod is TLR 7/8 agonist that is chemically related to imiquimod (Aldara). Resiquimod is more potent than imiquimod in inducing cytokine release owing to its ability to target two, not one, TLRs and its increased bioavailability. Our goal is to harness this small molecule to destroy malignant melanocytes, but to keep its effects localized to the site of injection to prevent systemic side effects. In addition, we plan to boost resiquimod with chemical enhancers that will increase the local anti-tumor immune response. Our preliminary data demonstrate that topical resiquimod has surprisingly potent therapeutic efficacy against established melanoma in multiple genetically engineered mouse (GEM) and syngeneic melanoma mouse models. Topical resiquimod treatment not only inhibited melanoma growth, but also suppressed lymph node metastasis while exhibiting the abscopal effect, whereby tumors distant from the site of treatment were also affected. We plan to develop an injectable form of resiquimod, which we believe will be even more effective against melanomas. Our goal is to minimize the dose of resiquimod needed to induce a local anti-melanoma immune response. We will formulate the safest and most effective form of injectable resiquimod first and test our best resulting product with anti-PD1 therapy. We are confident based on our preliminary data that combination injectable resiquimod/anti-PD1 treatment will be groundbreaking for melanoma as well as for many other malignancies such as lung and bladder cancers. We have the scientific and personnel capability to achieve these aims quickly and meticulously. Our innovative product will lay a solid foundation for IND-enabling studies that will ultimately bring a novel and effective therapy to clinicians and patients in their fight against melanoma.  "
"9242712","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this proposal is to develop noninvasive surface electromyogram (EMG) examination methods to overcome disadvantages of routine invasive needle EMG for examination of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and other pediatric neuromuscular diseases. There are two planned aims for the proposed study. The first aim is to develop and test noninvasive surface EMG decomposition methods using flexible surface electrode arrays, thus laying the foundation for their broad clinical applications, particularly for pediatric population. This includes validating and refining the developed methods using both computational and experimental approaches. The second aim is to perform a surface EMG examination of the pathological changes in SMA patients, mainly at the motor unit level, using the newly developed noninvasive methods. The approach utilized in the proposed project lie in recent advances in both surface EMG recording and signal processing methods. Our research design is based on 2-dimensional high resolution flexible electrode arrays suitable for pediatric surface EMG recording. Taking advantage of the spatial information and multi-channel recording of the electrode arrays, we will use the most appropriate EMG signal processing methods, particularly blind source separation techniques, to extract single motor unit activities from surface EMG. Toward clinical application, we will focus on efficient, robust, automatic and user-friendly implementation of the developed methods. A high resolution surface EMG examination of SMA patients will then be performed, with a view to determining whether the key electrodiagnostic findings of SMA can be made from the surface of examined muscles. The proposed activities will do much to improve the tolerability of pediatric EMG examination while maintaining/enhancing diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, thus benefiting a large number of infants, children and adolescents with neuromuscular diseases who may need EMG examination."
"9332693","Our project has two fundamental goals: 1) develop modular large aperture, high channel count arrays with associated electronics and make these modules widely available to the academic community, and 2) use these arrays to improve abdominal ultrasound (US) for the diagnosis of liver cancer, particularly for difficult to image patients. The overall 5-year relative survival rate for patients with primary liver cancer is 16%.  Imaging is used to monitor liver disease resulting from viral infections or cirrhosis and to detect a transition to malignancy, and ultrasound is the only recommended method for screening such patients at risk for cancer.  Yet, in patients with an abdominal wall thickness greater than 2.5 cm, only 33% of lesions were detected. More than 2/3 of Americans are now overweight or obese and larger channel count arrays and larger array footprints will improve imaging within this population and improve the detection of small lesions in the general population. Our approach addresses improved resolution (large aperture and bandwidth), sensitivity (single crystal transducers), high frame rate for super-resolution imaging (hundreds of frame/sec feasible), yield (array is composed of high yield modules), and image contrast (new switching capabilities enable new beamformation methods). Lateral US resolution is inversely proportional to the transducer aperture and consequently, improved resolution requires an increased number of transducer elements and electronic channels as well as advanced beam formation methods. Even in the presence of aberrating tissues the contrast achieved from an extended aperture facilitates the visualization of small structures. We propose to create PIN-PMN-PT array modules of dimension 16 elements (azimuth) by 32 elements (elevation) which will be combined to form large arrays. The user selectable ASIC matrices provide the opportunity to select: 512 elements from within a single module, to combine mirrored elements in elevation or to combine neighboring elements in azimuth or elevation. As a result, 4096 elements within the large aperture array can simultaneously be addressed from a programmable scanner. Preliminary work has resulted in the fabrication of prototype array and ASIC modules. The UC Davis team has been one of the first to produce multi-frequency arrays; USC has pioneered high frequency arrays and is currently home to Wodnicki (20 years of experience in ultrasound ASIC development at GE) and will collaborate with us on the development of high channel count arrays; Duke University has pioneered the development of strategies to use large apertures; Verasonics is the leading manufacturer of programmable ultrasound systems and will work with us to develop data handling methods and to distribute components to the ultrasound community; Sonic Concepts will manufacture the resulting arrays; and GE has offered support as an external advisor on the incorporation of these arrays into other commercial systems. This unique team will develop the technology, evaluate its use in a human study and will disseminate the technology.  "
"9329944","This proposal is a competitive renewal of the Penn State STEP-UP program initially funded in 2007 and renewed in 2011. The program is designed to provide short-term experience and training in biomedical research for undergraduate students from racial/ethnic-underrepresented groups, and for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. For the renewal, Penn State is joining with the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UTHSCSA) to enhance recruitment of URM students and increase the scope of student research experiences. W. Brian Reeves, M.D., Chair of Medicine at UTHSCSA and previously the PI of Penn State STEP-UP will serve as the contact PI. Dr. Gail Matters, who has served as the Program Coordinator since 2007 will serve as the Penn State PI. Progress under the current award period has been excellent. 227 students have matriculated through the Penn State STEP-UP program in its first ten years. Penn State has made targeted recruitment efforts through several minority student organizations which have resulted in a large increase in the number of applications received. Applications now exceed available positions by a 5:1 ratio. Since its inception over 64% of Penn State STEP-UP alumni are either enrolled in or have completed post-graduate education in the biomedical sciences and an additional 18% are employed in biomedical fields. The current proposal builds on the successes of the current STEP-UP program and significantly expands the mentoring activities to provide more sustained support to the students. The plan provides background and hands-on experience in research related to the mission of NIDDK. The plan also provides for technical advising and mentoring of students during their hands-on research experience, at a summer-end research symposium and during the subsequent academic year. The aims of the proposal are: 1. Provide a hands-on research experience through which students will learn how discovery, clinical and translational research are conducted and the results are disseminated to others. 2. Provide mentoring and career development activities to enhance entry and retention of students in biomedical research. The curriculum will also include discussions on normative standards of conduct, privacy and confidentiality issues, laboratory safety, research integrity, record keeping, data management, and communication skills. Although the primary goal of this proposal is to increase the number and competence of members of underrepresented groups in biomedical research, an important secondary benefit is to expand the proportion of underrepresented population who understand that life-style decisions have great consequences for their personal health and that of their family, friends and community."
"9328815","Abstract Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) are the primary cause of juvenile chronic kidney disease (CKD). There is no cure for CKD and progression of the disease can lead to end stage renal failure. A stronger understanding of the mechanisms that control normal kidney organogenesis will help in the design of therapeutics to treat CKD. TGF?/BMP signaling through Smads plays a pivitol role in renal fibrosis but the function of this pathway in interstitial cells during kidney development is poorly understood. Preliminary data presented in this application shows that loss of Smad4 in renal interstitial cell progenitors results in unrestricted proliferation and expansion of the medullary interstitium in postnatal mice. WNT/?-catenin drives interstitial proliferation in vivo and marker analysis shows that the loss of proliferation control observed in Smad4- deficient mice is associated with increased LEF1 expression. Therefore, Smad signaling and WNT/?- catenin/LEF1 may play opposing roles in regulating proliferation of renal interstitial cells during postnatal development. The proposed research strategy will 1) define the mechanism by which Smad4 suppresses proliferation of interstitial cells in vitro and 2) determine if BMP signaling through Smads antagonizes WNT-induced proliferation in the postnatal medullary interstitium in vivo. Through a combination of thoughtful mentoring, rigorous scientific investigation using novel methods of primary cell isolation and 3- dimensional tissue analyses, participation in technical workshops and scientific meetings, practice in manuscript and grant preparation, and an ongoing education in research ethics, the proposed training plan will prepare the applicant for a successful independent career in biomedical research."
"9258502","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prefrontal cortical (PFC) circuit dysfunction has emerged as a central pathological finding in depression and other stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders, and has been linked to characteristic deficits in regulating attention, reward processing, and executive control. All of these functions depend on working memory: a process that supports the short-term storage and manipulation of information, despite interference from competing, task-irrelevant information. Working memory is mediated in part by PFC pyramidal neurons, which exhibit sustained activity during active maintenance of a memory trace. This unusual capacity for sustained, internally generated activity is thought to emerge from the precisely coordinated activity of excitatory pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons, but the microcircuit-level mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Understanding how these cells interact in the service of working memory-and how they are disrupted in psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders-are fundamental challenges for systems neuroscience. Here, we will use optogenetic tools and two-photon (2P) calcium imaging to quantify and manipulate neural activity in awake, behaving mice and investigate how pyramidal cells interact with two interneuron subtypes to support working memory. Next, we will test the hypothesis that chronic stress disrupts these interactions, altering the balance of excitation and inhibition in PF microcircuits and impairing working memory. Finally, we will test the hypothesis that these effects are driven at the molecular level by deficits in BDNF-mediated plasticity mechanisms for maintaining synaptic homeostasis. The results of this work will advance our understanding of how prefrontal microcircuits support working memory, a core component of multiple psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. They may also inform future efforts to design new interventions targeting dysfunction in specific neuronal subtypes in mood and anxiety disorders."
"9305196","Social relationships influence diverse aspects of human health, from mood to mortality. Furthermore, many psychiatric disorders list psychopathologies of social behavior as one of their core symptoms (eg. autism, social anxiety disorder, antisocial personality disorder). Prairie voles are socially monogamous rodents that provide a means of studying the neural mechanisms that underlie attachment. While decades of research have now examined the basis of monogamy, the mechanisms underlying specific affiliation to non-mate peers remain largely unknown?despite the frequency and importance of peer relationships. In this project we examine peer relationships in prairie voles and contrast them to mate relationships, as well as to peer relationships in a related non-monogamous species. We specifically focus on the role of reward and dopamine transmission because mate relationships are highly rewarding and require activation of dopamine (type D2) receptors in order to form. Dopamine (type D1) receptors are involved in the maintenance of the pair bond and rejection of other potential social contacts. Evidence from a related vole?the meadow vole? suggests that peer affiliation is not dopamine dependent in this non-monogamous species, and the role of reward has not been tested.  Three specific aims investigate the role of reward and dopamine across relationship types. Aim 1 will determine whether social reward is an important feature of peer relationships using monogamous prairie voles and non-monogamous meadow voles. Voles will be tested for conditioned place preferences associated with social contact, and reward value will be quantified in voles trained to lever press for different social and non- social incentives. Aim 2 will use similar methods to assess the role of reward in mate versus peer relationships in prairie voles. Aim 3 will assess the role of dopamine in peer affiliation by measuring the effects of dopamine receptor manipulations on behavior, and by measuring the effects of social manipulations on the densities of dopamine (D1 and D2) receptors.  These studies will provide basic information on the role of reward and dopamine in peer relationships in a monogamous mammal, laying groundwork for better understanding of peer relationships in humans. The contrasts between a) prairie vole vs. meadow vole peer relationships, and b) prairie vole peer vs. mate relationships will determine whether these mechanisms are more consistent across types of relationships within a species, or within peer relationships across species. This will yield important insights into how these findings can be appropriately translated to human health, and which research models will provide them."
"9308125","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major public health problem in the United States. The application of magnetoencephalography (MEG) to the study of behavioral outcome of pediatric TBI is innovative because MEG may discern potential mechanisms for these outcomes. This potential derives from the fact that MEG is a functional neuroimaging tool that detects evidence of brain damage that eludes detection by MRI in the vast majority of cases of mild TBI and likely identifies additional lesions even in moderate to severe TBI. The goal of the proposed project is to study injury and psychosocial risk factors for the development of behavioral complications in children with TBI. The proposed study will involve a 3-month, 2-assessment, prospective longitudinal study of consecutively treated injured children with TBI (n=220) and a control group of children with orthopedic injuries (OI) not involving the brain (n=110). Assessments will include MEG and structural and functional MRI. Validated assessments of behavioral, psychiatric, neurobehavioral, and psychosocial variables will be administered.  The study will examine 4 major hypotheses: (1) Abnormal slow-wave MEG activity and its reduction (healing) from 2 weeks to 3 months postinjury will occur in higher magnitude and in more brain areas in TBI versus OI children, and with greater severity of TBI. The younger the age of children with TBI the slower the recovery will be over time. (2) MEG will be more sensitive and specific than MRI in detecting damaged areas of brain and altered connectivity in children with TBI and OI. (3) Injury variables (age, MEG slow waves, FA, severity, MRI volumetric indices, presence of brain lesion) will mediate changes in postconcussion symptoms, occurrence of new-onset psychiatric disorders, and attention function changes and outcome in children with TBI and OI, independent of effects of preinjury child variables (adaptive, academic and cognitive function, and comorbid psychiatric disorders), postinjury child variables (adaptive function, coping), preinjury family variables (family function, socioeconomic status, life-events, family psychiatric history), and postinjury family variables (functioning). (4) Compared with OI, children with TBI will perform more poorly and improve less on an n-back working memory task, and demonstrate a different pattern of MEG signal activation suggestive of frontal- parietal dysfunction.  This study will foster more accurate prediction, earlier identification and improved treatment of psychiatric and neurobehavioral complications related to pediatric TBI."
"9317366","Project Summary / Abstract Independent mobility, the ability of an individual to successfully navigate through their environment, is a primary contributor to quality of life. Unfortunately, mobility often decreases following a stroke, preventing many people with stroke from returning to typical levels of activity participation. A major contributor to reduced mobility is gait instability, which can limit function either by increasing the risk of falls or by decreasing an individual's confidence in their balance. Existing rehabilitation techniques have been shown to improve certain aspects of post-stroke gait function, such as increasing self-selected walking speed. However, these interventions have generally failed to address gait instability, as evidenced by a lack of improvement in fall risk. The long term objective of this line of research is to develop a toolbox of interventions for improving post-stroke gait instability, allowing clinicians to select the most appropriate option for individual patients. This project will focus on a potential mechanistic cause of instability, which has been suggested by preliminary work that identified a consistent neuromechanical gait stabilization strategy among controls. The present approach contrasts with typical investigations of gait instability, which largely focus on quantifying non-causal indicators of stability rather than understanding the underlying mechanism. The central hypothesis is that post-stroke gait instability is commonly caused by a lack of mechanically- appropriate adjustments in foot placement. Individuals with stable gait patterns consistently use a strategy of actively controlling their mediolateral foot placement based on the mechanical state of their center of mass. However, this evidence of active stabilization is lacking in a sub-population of stroke survivors with an increased fall risk. The proposed work will investigate the effects of a novel force-field designed to allow the real-time manipulation of mediolateral foot placement without interfering with gait progression. The first Specific Aim is to determine whether foot placement assistance promotes use of the typical gait stabilization strategy. The force-field will be used to encourage mechanically-appropriate foot placement while stroke survivors walk, which may drive restoration of gait stability by allowing participants to practice the desired movement pattern in an appropriately challenging environment. The second Specific Aim is to determine whether foot placement perturbation promotes use of the typical gait stabilization strategy. The force-field will be used to perturb foot placement away from mechanically-appropriate target locations, potentially causing error-driven adaptation toward the desired gait pattern as participants seek to cancel out these errors. The proposed project is based on a quantitative understanding of human gait mechanics, and takes advantage of a recently developed force-field designed to allow gait manipulations that were previously not feasible. The resultant knowledge has the potential to make an important contribution to the development of a larger-scale rehabilitation paradigm in which therapeutic interventions are targeted to a patient's specific limitations."
"9346331","PROJECT SUMMARY The Dengue (DENV) and Chikungunya viruses (CHIKV) are primarily transmitted by two types of mosquitoes, the Aedes aegypti and the Aedes albopictus. Patients infected by DENV may experience dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). DHF and DSS could be fatal and are of particular public health concern in endemic regions of the U.S., Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Patients infected by CHIKV experience symptoms similar to acute febrile illnesses ? fever and joint pain. Cases of CHIKV are on the rise in the U.S. as of 2013 when a significant number of cases were reported. Currently, no FDA-approved vaccines or anti-viral drugs are available in U.S. to mitigate the symptoms caused by these viral diseases. While early and accurate detection of vector-borne illnesses correlates to better outcomes, no single laboratory test can accurately diagnose and monitor DENV and CHIKV. To address the growing need for timely detection of vector-borne viruses, InnoSense LLC (ISL) and its collaborator, Colorado State University, propose to develop Nano-VIR, an innovative polymer nanowire microelectronic biosensor. The biosensor builds upon ISL?s emerging and proven polymer nanowire technology. Nano-VIR is expected to detect DENV and CHIKV with a sensitivity of 102?103 genome copy equivalent/ml with ?95% specificity within 30 minutes. In Phase I, ISL?s objectives are: (1) fabricate polymer nanowire biosensor for DENV and CHIKV detection; (2) demonstrate Nano-VIR?s capability to accurately detect DENV and CHIKV. In Phase II, ISL will optimize the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and reliability of the biosensor in a clinical setting using patient samples from CSU. Once optimized, a prototype with accompanying hardware and software will be developed for detection of both DENV and CHIKV in a single assay."
"9272267","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We uncovered a potential mechanism for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by performing whole exome sequencing (WES) in a family with a rare autosomal dominant form of RA characterized by interstitial lung disease (ILD). We found a single, rare, non-synonymous variant on chromosome 10 in the Surfactant Protein A2 (SFTPA2) gene (c.G532A:p.V178M) present only in diseased subjects. This result was unexpected given that the dominant phenotype in our patients is RA. Published evidence suggests that the variant we identified causes an increase in ER stress, though to our knowledge there are no reported molecular links between mutations in the lung and the development of RA. Interestingly, increasing evidence points to a central role of the lung in a subset of patients with RA. Observational studies show that cigarette smokers that express the HLA-DRB1 shared epitope (SE) alleles have a significantly elevated risk for developing RA. Cigarette smokers have more citrullinated proteins in the lung compared to non-smokers and one possible reason for this is that undefined bronchiolar stress from cigarette smokes promotes citrullination of lung proteins. In relation to RA, antibodies to citrullinated proteins have been found in a significant portion of patients with RA. We propose that the SFPTA2 mutation identified in this family leads to increased ER stress in the lung, which then promotes lung protein citrullination, and that via T cell-related mechanisms, this results in a phenotype of RA and possibly RA-ILD. Using patient cell lines and molecular tools developed in the lab, we are defining the functional consequences of the mutation we identified on ER stress as well as citrullination of proteins. Through experiments in humanized mice, we are studying the role of the lung epithelium in the initiation of RA."
"9287264","Project summary  The long term goal of our research is to understand and manipulate immune surveillance pathways. The antigen processing pathway yields thousands of peptide/MHC complexes (pMHC I) on the cell surface as potential ligands for CD8+ T cells to allow detection of viruses or cancer. It is now clear that generation of the normal pMHC I repertoire requires peptide trimming in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by ERAAP, the ER aminopeptidase associated with antigen processing. The ERAAP is targeted for immune evasion by viruses and polymorphisms in this gene are linked to many autoimmune diseases. It is therefore essential to monitor ERAAP activity to ensure effective immune surveillance by CD8+ T cells.  We had discovered earlier that the unique FL9 nona peptide ? derived from the Fam49a/b proteins of unknown function ? was presented by the non-classical MHC Ib molecule called Qa-1b only in ERAAP- deficient cells. This FL9 peptide/Qa-1 complex, called QFL was recognized by QFL-specific CD8+ T cells which lysed target cells expressing this ligand. Thus QFL- T cells are a mechanism for detecting and eliminating cells with ERAAP-deficiency. The QFL-T cells are relatively abundant, and share key characteristics with other innate-like iNKT (invariant NK T) and MAIT (mucosal - associated invariant T) cells which are also restricted by non-classical MHC Ib molecules and respond to various microbial and self-antigens.  Here we propose to fill gaps in our understanding of how the immune system monitors the fidelity of antigen processing in the ER. We hypothesize that QFL-specific CD8+ T cells and the mechanisms for generating the QFL-ligand are conserved sensors for detecting ERAAP-inhibition. Furthermore, disruption of these mechanisms in ERAAP-deficient mice may result in autoimmune obesity.  We will accomplish these goals by (a) characterizing the ?? TCRs and the thymic developmental pathway for QFL-T cells to understand how these cells arise and acquire their unique functions, (b) defining the molecular steps for generating the QFL-ligand by analyzing the processing of Fam49a/b precursors into the FL9 peptide for loading the Qa-1 MHC Ib, and (c) defining the anatomical location(s) and function(s) of QFL-T cells in normal WT mice as well as their obese ERAAP-/- counterparts. Relevance Autoimmunity results when immune tolerance to self-antigens is disrupted. Understanding how self-antigens are produced by proteolytic enzymes will likely reveal potential ways to intervene in autoimmune disorders."
"9220600","Project Summary One of the central limitations of PET/MRI is the lack of accurate means of attenuation correction, which leads to inaccurate and inconsistent quantification of radiotracer uptake. The inconsistency of PET quantification prevents the widespread adoption of PET/MRI in clinical trials, where a precise and reproducible measurement of radiotracer uptake is required. We propose in this application to develop a standard methodology to evaluate MR based attenuation correction techniques and the related PET quantitation accuracy in order to qualify PET/MRI scanners for clinical trials and clinical work. This work will be done in three specific aims. First, we will evaluate materials and create a physical phantom for evaluation of MR based attenuation correction techniques. We will subsequently validate the phantom using a patient study to demonstrate that we can accurately estimate deviations of measured activity using the PET/MRI phantom. Finally, we will harmonize the reconstruction parameters on the two available PET/MRI scanners and evaluate the reproducibility of the quantitative accuracy across 12 PET/ MRI sites split between the two PET/MRI manufacturers. Finally we will incorporate the PET/MRI harmonization data into a global harmonization study that includes both PET/MRI and PET/CT. Through the work described, we aim to create a standardized approach to evaluate the accuracy of PET quantification in the setting of PET/MRI. A standardized methodology will incent vendors to develop attenuation correction methods that result in more consistent uptake estimates across systems, and the ability to qualify scanners will help the adoption of PET/MRI into clinical trials and clinical care."
"9302876","Project Summary Melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer and, if disseminated through the dermis, has a poor prognosis with a high mortality rate. Hypoxia is a component of the tumor microenvironment, which reduces efficacy of both immuno- and chemo-therapies resulting in poor clinical outcome. Therefore, we will exploit the hypoxic microenvironment as a target for gene therapy, utilizing commensal facultative anaerobic bacteria. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop an effective and safe delivery system for cancer gene therapy by targeting the hypoxic tumor microenvironment with food-grade lactic acid bacteria (LAB) Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis). The use of LAB, as opposed to other bacteria, represents a much more desirable strategy to deliver therapeutic genes than attenuated pathogenic strains, as there is no risk of reversion or potential to instigate host reactions in immunocompromised patients. Because identification of tumor-specific accumulation and biodistribution of gene delivery vehicles in vivo is essential for translation of these agents to the clinic, we will utilize a newly emerging technology, multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT). MSOT is a hybrid modality that detects sound waves generated by the absorption of electromagnetic energy, thus enabling the capability for 3D high-resolution at depth and in real time. Our preliminary data indicates that L. lactis expresses high levels of -galactosidase (LacZ), and in combination with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-?-D- galactopyranoside (X-gal), produces a strong blue color to facilitate detection of L. lactis using MSOT. Given these findings, we hypothesize that L. lactis will preferentially colonize the hypoxic areas of the tumor microenvironment to deliver therapeutic genes in a safe, tumor-specific, and effective manner. We propose two aims: (1) Evaluate the efficacy of L. lactis as a gene delivery vehicle in melanoma cells in vitro, and (2) determine the biodistribution and tumor-specific accumulation of L. lactis in metastatic melanoma-bearing mice. The successful completion of this proposal will substantially influence the field of gene therapy, specifically utilization of facultative bacteria as delivery agents for tumor-specific targeting of melanoma."

"9443129","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal structural and functional connectivity (interaction between brain regions) is central to the pathophysiology of psychotic illnesses like schizophrenia and psychotic bipolar disorder. Modern neuroimaging techniques and analytic strategies provide an unprecedented capacity to more fully characterize the functional and structural psychotic disconnectivity. Individuals with psychotic illness and their unaffected relatives have abnormal connectivity, suggesting that at least a portion of psychotic disconnectivity is associated with genetic predisposition for the diseases. Imaging-based connectivity endophenotypes are ideally suited to aid the functional characterization of putative risk genes, allowing us to move beyond a genotype-phenotype association to delineating mechanisms that give rise to psychotic illnesses. Recently, large-scale exome sequencing in individuals of European ancestry provided the strongest evidence to date for specific genetic variants that increase risk for psychosis. These primarily rare mutations were spread across gene networks involved in neuronal processes, including calcium channels and postsynaptic signaling. Our goals are to replicate these promising genetic findings in a different ethnic group, African-Americans, and determine whether and how these gene sets impact psychotic disconnectivity. African-Americans, an underserved population, have ~32% more highly deleterious non-synonymous rare variants in these networks than individuals of European ancestry, improving our power to detect rare variants. Our aims are to: (1) use modern MRI acquisition and analysis techniques based on the Human Connectome Project to document psychotic disconnectivity in 750 African Americans (375 with a psychotic disorder and 375 demographically matched comparison subjects). We will test hypotheses that diagnostic and dimensional indices of psychosis are associated with reduced global functional connectivity but intact global structural connectivity, combined with aberrant connectivity between specific regions or tracts; (2) conduct whole exome sequencing (WES) to test the influence of rare non-synonymous variants from genes in previously identified gene sets on psychosis risk using a network-centered analysis strategy. We will test hypotheses that the voltage-gated calcium ion channel, and the ARC-associated scaffold protein and the NMDAR postsynaptic signaling complexes influence diagnostic and dimensional indices of psychosis; and (3) apply this same network-centric test to determine if gene sets implicated in illness risk also influence functional and structural psychotic disconnectivity. Linking these genetic pathways to psychotic disconnectivity will provide mechanistic insights into the genomic influences on psychotic illness. Our collaborative application includes sites at Yale/Hartford Hospital (DC Glahn PI), Stanford (RA Poldrack PI) and Texas Biomedical Research Institute (J Blangero PI). Our results should bolster our understanding of the genetic architecture of psychotic illness and provide important clues for traversing the chasm between identified genetic networks and the behaviorally defined disorder."
"9233091","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  New genes and pathomechanisms of congenital anomalies of the kidney (CAKUT). Chronic kidney diseases (CKD) take a high toll on human health, requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation for survival. In the first 2 decades of life ~0% of CKD is caused by CAKUT. However, very little is known about its etiology and pathogenesis. No curative treatment or prophylaxis is available. We identified novel single-gene causes of CAKUT in mutations of the genes SIX1, SIX5 and TRAP1 (PNAS 2004; AJHG 2007; JASN 2013). Recently, we showed that >10% of CAKUT is 'monogenic' in origin, being caused by mutations in one of >21 different genes (KI 85:1429, 2014). Other groups revealed a CNV disorder in ~15% of CAKUT (AJHG 91:987, 2012). Using genetic mapping, whole exome sequencing (WES) and high-throughput candidate gene analysis, we identified very recently 11 novel single-gene causes of isolated CAKUT: FRAS1, FREM2, GRIP1, FREM1, GREM1, ITGA8, TRAP1, SRGAP1, SLIT2, TBX18, and TSHZ3. Single-gene causes have started to coalesce around distinct signaling pathways, including FRAS-FREM signaling, ROBO2-SLIT2-SRGAP1 signaling, and differentiation of ureteric smooth muscle (TBX18 and TSHZ3), thus elucidating the pathogenesis of CAKUT. Our data demonstrate that: i) a high percentage of CAKUT is caused by single-gene mutations in a multitude of genes, ii) several dozen single-gene causes of CAKUT are yet to be identified, iii) WES, and a high-throughput candidate sequencing that we developed very efficiently reveal novel disease genes and developmental pathways that are involved in the pathogenesis of human CAKUT. From these data we hypothesize that single-gene mutations in many distinct unidentified genes will represent novel monogenic causes of CAKUT, and that gene identification will allow delineation of further disease mechanisms of CAKUT. To this end we now: 1) Ascertained >2,400 families with CAKUT, 2) Developed rapid sequencing to identify mutations in CAKUT candidate genes, and 3) Performed linkage mapping in 140 CAKUT families from the US, India and Kuwait. We will now employ WES in 480 sib cases and 40 consanguineous CAKUT families and apply our newly developed high-throughput sequencing approaches to the identification and pathogenic characterization of novel CAKUT-causing genes, with the specific aims: 1. Identify novel full-penetrance recessive causes of CAKUT by genetic mapping and whole  exome sequencing in 520 families. 2. Identify novel causes of CAKUT by high-throughput candidate gene analysis and study  genotype-phenotype correlations in large molecularly defined cohorts. 3. Delineate disease mechanisms of CAKUT by further characterizing genetic defects of the newly  implicated SLIT2-ROBO2-SRGAP1 and TBX18-THSZ3 pathways. Gene identification is a prerequisite to address prevention of this predominating cause of early-onset CKD."
"9238602","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research program is to establish the basic mechanisms whereby mutations in thin filament proteins lead to complex human cardiomyopathies, and use this knowledge to create a predictive clinical tool. The ability to connect genotype to phenotype in patients with these mutations is limited because of the long time for disease to develop to the stage where it is diagnosed. A computational model of the cardiac thin filament developed in the last grant period, recently significantly extended to includ both actin and atomistic water, has allowed us to derive atomic level pictures of how specific mutation effect thin filament Ca2+ binding and ? -adrenergic signaling. These results have been fully verified by both in vitro and in vivo experiment. In this application we propose to transform our integrative approach from explanatory to predictive. For a set of thin filament mutations, we will use our computational model to obtain data in dynamics, structure, chemistry, and cooperativity that will be correlated to in vitro experimental results. These correlations will be used to create a set of rules that propose extension of the correlation to whole animal and eventually human disease state. We will then test these rules on a specific set of de novo mutations provided by our collaborators across the globe. Our prediction will be first validated in in vitro experiment and for a subset in newly generated transgenic mice. The methods used to study this system are highly innovative, and we also propose to extend our model for the first time to include ATP hydrolysis in myosin. This program will be implemented in the following 3 specific aims. Specific Aim 1: To utilize our recently developed all-atom, explicitly solvated model of the cardiac thin filament to evaluate and mechanistically define both the local and physically distant effects of known human mutations on complex structure and dynamics, and to map these results to in vitro experiment. Specific Aim 2: To test the predictive value of our rules developed from the integrative system (Aim 1) and to iteratively correct the rules. We will computationally query and stratify multiple unique disease-causing thin filament mutations into functionally defined groups. These predictions will be tested experimentally. Specific Aim 3.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): School gardening programs offer affordable and accessible fruits and vegetables (FV), teach children how to grow, cook, and enjoy FV, and show promising effects on reducing obesity and related diseases in low-income Hispanics. Lack of access to healthy and affordable food is a significant factor contributing to elevated rates of obesity and metabolic risk factors among low-income Hispanics. There is a growing national and grassroots movement to support gardening efforts to make healthy foods more affordable and accessible and to make intake more sustainable for low-income families. However, few experimental studies have evaluated the impact of garden-based interventions on obesity and related metabolic disorders. We recently completed an NIH R21 grant, which was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the effects of a gardening, nutrition, and cooking program in 375 low-income Hispanic students living in Los Angeles. Preliminary results from this study show that intervention compared to the control students have reductions in BMI parameters and waist circumference, increases in daily intake of dietary fiber and vegetables, and improved lipid profiles. We want to expand and replicate this study by: a) using a cluster randomized school design; b) implementing the program during school hours; c) increasing sample size; d) lengthening the intervention period to one school year; e) collecting comprehensive metabolic measurements on the child; f) enhancing family workshops; g) collecting more parental data; and h) developing and evaluating sustainability strategies. Thus, the overall goal of this project is to test the effects of a large school-based gardening, nutrition, and cooking RCT (called Sprouts) on dietary intake, dietary-related behaviors, obesity, and related metabolic disorders in low-income Hispanic youth and their families in Central Texas. Sixteen elementary schools will be randomized to either: 1) Sprouts intervention or 2) Control (delayed intervention). At each intervention school, we will build edible gardens; form and train Garden Leadership Coalitions (GLCs); teach 20 Sprouts in-school lessons to the students; and teach nine family-based Sprouts lessons throughout school year. The following measures will be obtained for students at baseline and post-intervention: height, weight, BMI, waist circumference, body composition (via bioimpedance), blood pressure, glucose, insulin, and lipids (via voluntary fasting blood draws), dietary intake, and related psychosocial behaviors (e.g., preference/motivation/self-efficacy to eat FV). We will also measure anthropometrics, dietary intake, and related dietary psychosocial variables on the parents at baseline and post-intervention. After the intervention year, we will provide a series of training workshops and resources to the GLCs and schoolteachers to sustain the Sprouts program in subsequent years. We will measure the sustainability employed by each school by process logs/surveys, structured interviews, and school observations. The findings could provide a successful, sustainable model for garden- based school programs that decrease the obesity and metabolic diseases impacting Hispanic populations."
"9403424","Project Summary/Abstract This is a first R01 application from an early stage, new investigator and current NIEHS K01 awardee. Parkinson disease (PD) is a disabling neurodegenerative disease for which there is no cure. Years before the diagnosis of PD and the onset of motor symptoms, PD patients develop non-motor symptoms, including, importantly, constipation and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Constipation affects over 80% of PD patients and is one of the strongest risk factors for PD. Recent research shows that the enteric nervous system in the gut and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve which anatomically links the GI system to the brain, are among the first and most severely affected by alpha-synuclein pathology characteristic of PD5 leading to the hypothesis that the gastrointestinal tract might be the site of initiation of PD. We propose to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the relation between human gut microbiome and PD, focusing on the pre- onset microbiome. We will do this by building on an ongoing Department of Defense funded project that has identified participants with pre-parkinson syndrome (PPS - defined as the co- occurrence of constipation, pRBD (probable rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder) and hyposmia) that in a pilot study has been associated with a ~200 fold increase in PD risk. Studying the microbiome among this group, who are highly likely to develop PD or are already in the premotor state, will give us a unique look at the microbiome in PD patients prior to any potential disease-associated effects of changes in diet and lifestyle that may have confounded prior case-control studies. The proposed study will take advantage of 25 years of prospectively collected data on environmental and dietary exposures and disease outcomes in two prospective cohorts of men and women."
"9434644","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) patients have increased fracture risk, have a higher risk of fracture-related mortality, and are difficult to treat due to CKD's metabolic complexity. Furthermore, standard practices for monitoring fracture risk (i.e. bone mineral density, BMD) have limitations in this patient population. Currently, treatment for CKD-MBD patients is primarily focused on suppressing elevated parathyroid hormone, as can be accomplished with a calcimimetic. Cinacalcet, an FDA approved calcimimetic, effectively reduces parathyroid hormone, slows bone turnover and increases bone mass, yet it only modestly reduces fracture risk. This suggests a defect in bone quality, not just bone loss, is contributing to CKD fragility, and this notion is supported by recent evidence of alterations in collagen cross-linking and matrix hydration in CKD bone. Preliminary data collected for this study found evidence of bone microdamage, another important factor of bone quality which is previously unstudied in CKD. Microdamage is known to interact with porosity, thus the combination of these issues may have significant impact on CKD fragility. In summary, normalizing fracture risk in these patients will likely require more than simply suppressing bone loss; the bone quality must also be treated. We hypothesize that the quality of CKD bone can be improved using a combination treatment of calcimimetic, to reduce parathyroid hormone and bone loss, and raloxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator drug for osteoporosis recently revealed to have direct positive effects on bone tissue quality. We will test this hypothesis using a slowly progressive model of CKD-MBD, the Cy/+ rat. This study will first quantify the extent of skeletal microdamage in the bones of 30 and 35-week old CKD rats in comparison to their normal, age-matched littermates. We expect CKD to cause progressively increasing accumulation of cortical porosity and microdamage, with interactions occurring between microcracks and porosity. Next, the ability of combination calcimimetic and raloxifene treatment to improve measures of bone quantity and quality will be tested. Cy/+ rats will be treated from 25 to 35 weeks of age with vehicle, raloxifene, calcimimetic, or both drugs. Primary outcomes will be determined by skeletal analyses (microdamage, histology, microCT, bone density, mechanical testing, and resistance to fatigue), though the treatments' effects on the biochemical and renal components of CKD-MBD will be assessed as well. We predict that raloxifene will improve the mechanical properties of bone by improving bone quality and reducing microdamage formation, while calcimimetic treatment will improve mechanical properties by increasing bone mass and reducing porosity. Combination therapy should exceed both single treatments by positively impacting both quality and mass. An understanding of the detrimental impact of CKD on bone quality is a crucial step in preventing fractures in these patients. This study provides an important step in achieving this goal by examining these changes and their potential corrections in a rat model with spontaneous and progressive development of CKD."

"9316788","Summary Project 2 will test the hypothesis that despite their complexity and tortuous nature, the somatic evolution of B cells to bNAb activity is deterministic. That is, generation of bNAbs will follow a common and reproducible pathway(s) of clonal evolution that is reproducible in response to SHIV infections with chimeric viruses bearing Envs from primary or transmitted/founder HIV-1 strains. This question is crucial to the potential utility of all HIV- 1 lineage design vaccine strategies: if bNAb responses are unique accidents of somatic evolution, lineage design vaccines based on the response of a single, rare human subject are unlikely to be generally applicable. In contrast, if clonal evolution to bNAb activity in individual humans and in RMs follows a shared evolutionary trajectory guided by serial antigen exposure, lineage design vaccines that guide clonal evolution will be potentially effective in many vaccinees. Project 2 comprises three Specific Aims. In Aims 1 and 2, we propose to characterize the germinal center (GC) and memory B-cell (Bmem) responses in RMs identically infected in Project 1 with molecularly cloned SHIV-CH848 (or other V3-glycan targeting SHIV) or SHIV-CAP256 (or other V1V2 targeting SHIV). The principal goal of these studies is to determine whether the NAb and bNAb responses of different outbred RMs are substantially similar in a SHIV Env-specific manner. In collaboration with Cores B and C, we will define the specificity, avidity, neutralization capacity, and somatic genetics of NAb and bNAb B cells elicited by SHIV infection. Similar B-cell responses, as defined by specificity and V(D)J selection, will demonstrate that deterministic factors control the somatic evolution of NAb and bNAb B cells elicited by SHIV infection. In Aim 3, we propose to follow the B cell responses of SHIV infected RMs that have been vaccinated by Project 3. In the event that any vaccine does not confer full and complete resistance to infection, Aim 3 will allow us to characterize the vaccine's effects on clonal selection, affinity maturation, and changes in the frequencies of NAb and bNAb B-cell clones elicited by SHIV infection. This information will allow Project 3 to ?tune? vaccine strategies for maximal effect. 1   "
"9332735","Summary/Abstract: Pertussis (aka whooping cough) is a serious reemerging public health problem with incidence estimated at 20 million cases annually and deaths (mostly in infants) at ~200,000 annually. Recent rises in pertussis in countries with high vaccine coverage, such as the United States, correlate with a switch from whole cell (wP) to acellular (aP) pertussis vaccines and are attributed to a larger reservoir of infected individuals composed of adolescents and young adults who were vaccinated (rather than infected) as children. It is now apparent that immunity induced by aP vaccination is not as durable as vaccination by wP vaccination, which is not as durable as immunity induced by infection with Bordetella pertussis, the primary causal agent of pertussis. Moreover, while immunization with wP and aP vaccines provides protection against disease (at least initially), it does not protect against colonization. New vaccines that provide sterilizing, long-lasting immunity are needed. We have discovered a previously uncharacterized signal transduction system (PlrSR) that is required for B. pertussis and the closely-related broad host range pathogen Bordetella bronchiseptica to colonize and persist in the lower respiratory tract (LRT). Our preliminary data support a model in which PlrSR functions as a kinase in response to increased CO2 and low oxygen conditions (reflective of the LRT), resulting in high levels of PlrR-phosphate (PlrR~P) that activate expression of genes including those encoding high-affinity cytochrome oxidases. Our model states that under aerobic conditions, PlrS functions primarily as a phosphatase, and that low levels of PlrR~P are essential for cell viability. We will use genetic, molecular biological, and genome-wide approaches to identify PlrSR-regulated genes, especially those induced only in the LRT, and will determine the roles of PlrSR-dependent gene regulation and of the factors encoded by the regulated genes in virulence. Using genetic approaches, we will determine the role of the PlrS PDC and PAS domains, as well as the predicted kinase and phosphatase activities of PlrS, in the ability of the bacteria to grow in vitro and in the LRT. Using biochemical approaches, we will determine if PlrS is a redox- sensitive heme-containing protein that functions as a kinase under low oxygen conditions and a phosphatase in ambient air, and we will identify DNA sequences to which PlrR~P binds. Our results will be significant because previously unknown PlrSR-dependent virulence factors, and the PlrSR system itself, will be excellent candidates for the development of new component vaccines and targets for the development of new therapeutics. Our results will also advance our understanding NtrYX family proteins (of which PlrSR is a member and which control virulence in other pathogens) function and they will provide insight into how respiratory pathogens, in general, grow in the LRT."
"9333725","Abstract Title: Mechanism of Lassa fever virus Z protein in immune suppression and viral virulence  Lassa fever virus (LASV) is the most significant arenavirus pathogen that causes endemic and lethal hemorrhagic fever (HF) in humans in West Africa with thousand of death annually. Importation of LASV infection to USA and other Western counties has been repeatedly documented due to increased human travel to and from the endemic countries. Currently there is no vaccine and limited treatment options against LASV. Among LASV-infected individuals, there are significant heterogeneity in disease severity, which ranges from asymptomatic infections to multi-organ failure and death, the reason for which is unknown but may partly be due to the different LASV isolates that show sequence variations up to 32%. Molecular determinants for LASV virulence remain unknown. LASV pathogenesis has not been well understood but is associated with a general host immune suppression that is characterized by the lack of early innate immune responses and the absence of effective adaptive immunity. The long-term goal of our work is to understand the mechanisms of LASV virulence and disease pathogenesis in order to develop the much-needed vaccines and antivirals. We have recently discovered a unique ability of the Z protein of several known pathogenic arenaviruses (including LASV) to inhibit the human RIG-i-like receptors (RLRs) RIG-i and MDA5, which are the intracellular sensors of RNA viruses. We have also obtained preliminary evidence to show that the Z proteins from different LASV isolates vary in their ability to inhibit RLRs. In addition, we show that this Z-mediated RLR binding and inhibition is species specific, which may explain the observed differences in disease pathogenesis in different animal species. We hypothesize that the virus- and host-dependent inhibition of RLRs by LASV Z proteins is a novel virulence determinant and propose the following aims to test this hypothesis. Aim 1: Dissect the molecular mechanism of LASV Z-mediated RLR inhibition. Aim 2: Determine the biological role of LASV Z-mediated RLR inhibition in viral virulence. Aim 3: Investigate the species-specific mechanism of LASV Z-mediated of RLR inhibition.  These studies focus on a novel immune suppressive and virulent mechanism mediated by LASV Z protein, which will not only make major impacts on both basic and translational research of arenavirus pathogens, but also provide new knowledge in host-pathogen interactions, host antiviral responses, and viral immune evasion mechanisms."
"9311984","In order to study the molecular mechanisms underlying DCIS progression, we developed a model that we refer to as mouse-intraductal (MIND). MIND involves injection of epithelial cells derived from patient DCIS into the mammary ducts of immunocompromised mice. DCIS MIND xenografts exhibited the full spectrum of human DCIS including invasive progression. Histology of xenografted DCIS lesions that progressed to invasion showed disruption of basement membrane and myoepithelial layer by the invasive cells, retraction of myoepithelial layer and microinvasion. Therefore, the DCIS MIND model is a valuable tool for studying the early molecular mechanisms underlying DCIS invasive progression in a manner that is individualized to each patient DCIS. This proposal that is aimed at further improving the translation application of MIND models by mimicking the natural microenvironment of human DCIS in mice, is directly responsive to this FOA. The following specific aims (SA) are proposed: SA 1) Humanize mouse mammary fat pads with patient derived immortalized fibroblasts and study effects on DCIS progression to invasion, pathology and biomarker expression. The DCIS xenografts ± humanized fat pads will be assessed for pathology, biomarker expression and progression to invasion. We expect the xenografted DCIS with humanized mammary fat pads to more closely resemble patient DCIS with respect to pathology and biomarker expression. We also expect the humanized fat pads to enhance DCIS invasive progression in a fraction of DCIS MIND xenografts. Additionally, we will correlate DCIS epithelial cell inherent molecular aberrations (gene expression and/or genomic aberrations) to DCIS invasive behavior in the DCIS MIND xenografts. SA 2) Reconstitute the mouse hematopoietic system with patient derived immune cells and study effects on DCIS progression to invasion, pathology and biomarker expression. The experimental procedure involves reconstitution of mouse hematopoietic system with patient derived immune cells. We will utilize MISTRG mice, which are highly permissive for human hematopoiesis including support of the development and function of monocytes, macrophages and NK cells. DCIS xenografts ± patient derived immune system will be assessed for human immune cell infiltration to DCIS, DCIS pathology and invasive behavior as described in SA 1. We will correlate the recruitment of specific immune cells to DCIS as well as DCIS epithelial cell inherent molecular aberrations (gene expression and/or genomic aberrations) to DCIS invasive behavior in the MIND xenografts."

"9208729","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that accounts for approximately 50-80% of dementia cases worldwide. The disease is characterized by progressive cognitive decline and severe memory loss. As current therapies for AD offer limited benefit if any, the need to better understand the mechanisms of cognitive decline in AD cannot be overstated. The key finding that AD is associated with seizures may provide valuable insight into these mechanisms. Recent evidence suggests that seizures in AD are not just incidental, but may play an active role in contributing to cognitive decline early in disease progression. Consistent with this, treatment of both AD patients and AD mouse models with antiepileptics improves cognitive function. Therefore, understanding how seizures contribute to cognitive decline may open an avenue to discover novel therapies that can mitigate cognitive deficits and improve quality of life for AD patients, as well as for patients wih other neurological disorders accompanied by seizures. As such, this proposal focuses on the molecular and cellular changes induced by seizures in the hippocampus, a brain region severely affected by AD. Preliminary studies utilizing transgenic mice that express the human amyloid precursor protein (APP) carrying disease-linked mutations revealed that these mice exhibited epileptic spike activity and seizures as early as two months of age, just prior to the onset of cognitive deficits and significantly earlier than amyloid plaque deposition. Furthermore, examination of hippocampi in these mice showed markedly increased expression of a transcription factor ?FosB. This finding was particularly interesting considering that the increas in ?FosB expression corresponded with both epileptic activity in the brain as well as cognitive impairment. Previous studies of ?FosB in other brain regions demonstrated that this transcription factor has an unusually long half-life (on the order of weeks) and interacts with HDACs. As such, ?FosB may play an important role in long-term epigenetic gene regulation. Notably, our preliminary investigation of ?FosB in the hippocampus revealed two important gene targets: cFos and calbindin-D28k. Since these genes play important functions in synaptic plasticity as well as cell survival, their regulation by ?FosB supports the hypothesis that ?FosB contributes to both neuroprotection and synaptic dysfunction during states of chronic neuronal hyperexcitation. Therefore, the goals of this proposal are to elucidate the functions of ?FosB in AD and other seizure-related disorders. The Aims of this proposal are to 1) evaluate whether expression of ?FosB is sufficient to drive gene expression changes and cognitive dysfunction in vivo and 2) investigate the mechanisms by which ?FosB epigenetically regulates target genes, and the role that ?FosB plays in neuroprotection in vitro. Results from these studies will pave the way for the development of much-needed novel therapies to improve cognitive function in AD and other seizure-related disorders."

"9443837","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term goal is to understand molecular mechanisms involved in the diurnal regulation of plasma lipid concentrations and to find out how perturbations in this regulation contribute to dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. We observed that plasma triglyceride and cholesterol, mainly those associated with non-HDL apoB-lipoproteins, exhibit diurnal rhythms. During the previous funding cycle, we showed that plasma lipid diurnal rhythms are altered when animals are subject to food entrainment and are not seen in Clock mutant mice. Mechanistic studies revealed that Clock, a critical component of the circadian regulatory loop, controls diurnal regulation of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), an essential chaperone for the biosynthesis of apoB-containing triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, involving SHP. This regulatory process suppresses MTP expression and lowers plasma triglycerides at the onset of light in mice. When circadian control is impaired mice develop sustained hyperlipidemia because this regulatory mechanism becomes inoperative. Hence, we hypothesize that circadian mechanisms protect against hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. Besides Clock, the positive loop of circadian regulation requires Bmal1. The aim of this proposal is to define the role of Bmal1 in the development of hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis and to uncover molecular, biochemical, and physiological mechanisms that control plasma lipid and atherosclerosis. Our approach will be to ablate Bmal1 expression globally or in tissue-specific manner and then to compare various physiological, biochemical, and molecular aspects with their wild type siblings. Our first aim is to elucidate the role of Bmal1 in diurnal and food entrained regulation of plasma lipids and lipoproteins. The second aim is to ascertain the contribution of hepatic and intestinal Bmal1 in the regulation of plasma lipids/lipoproteins. The third aim is to recognize the role of Bmal1 in the progression of atherosclerosis. Bmal1-/- /Ldlr-/- and Bmal1-/-/Apoe-/- mice on C57BL/6J background will be fed ad libitum chow or western diet and development of atherosclerosis will be documented. Additionally, we will evaluate the effect of intestinal and hepatic Bmal1 ablation on atherosclerosis. We expect to demonstrate that Bmal1 is vital in maintaining plasma lipid and lipoprotein homeostasis, and in the prevention of atherosclerosis. The outcomes from these studies will impact two fields of biology; lipid metabolism and circadian regulation. Novel understanding about the circadian regulation of lipid metabolism will be garnered."

Additionally, Salmonella spp are category B pathogens that have the potential to be used as bio-terror weapons. The overall goal of this application is to advance the development of cross-protective vaccines against enteric fevers by identifying humoral and cell-mediated immune responses (CMI) which might play significant roles in protection. A secondary overall aim is to provide data to validate the S. Typhi /S. Paratyphi A bivalent vaccine approach to vaccination against enteric fevers. The proposed studies will take advantage of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and sera specimens obtained from subjects orally immunized with Ty21a and CVD 909 typhoid vaccines or with the attenuated CVD 1902 S. Paratyphi A candidate vaccine, from subjects challenged with wild-type (wt)-S. Typhi and wt-S. Paratyphi A and from typhoid and paratyphoid A patients in endemic areas. We will utilize the power of cutting edge immunologic platforms such as mass and conventional multichromatic flow cytometry analysis and sorting to characterize S. Typhi-, S. Paratyphi A-, and B-specific B([memory]) (BM), T [memory] ?, and T [regulatory] (T reg) responses, including   their patterns of cytokine production and homing/chemokine receptor expression using a systems biology like approach. We will also perform immunoprofiling studies to identify genome-wide cross-reactive proteins that elicit serum antibody responses. Specifically, we propose to test the following hypotheses:       (1) a defined set of CMI responses play a key role in cross-protection between S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi B infection in Ty21a-immunized subjects, (2) oral immunization of volunteers with an attenuated S. Paratyphi A vaccine strain (CVD 1902) or exposed to wt-S. Paratyphi A elicits a defined set of CMI responses against S. Paratyphi A antigens and infected cells that cross-react with S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi B antigens, and (3) oral immunization with the attenuated S. Paratyphi A CVD 1902 vaccine or exposure to wt-S.

"9305681","Project Summary Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders (EGIDs) are a group of inflammatory diseases triggered by food or aero- allergens and characterized by an excessive accumulation and persistence of eosinophils within intestinal tissues and a Th2-dominant immune response. Despite a worldwide increase in prevalence, the natural disease course of EGIDs is unknown, and treatment options limited to food allergen avoidance and oral corticosteroids. EGID symptoms and treatments carry heavy social and psychological tolls, particularly in affected children. Eosinophils are innate immune leukocytes that constitutively home to lamina propria of the small and large intestine in the steady-state. Fundamental factors that govern excessive eosinophil accumulation and persistence within gastrointestinal tissues in EGID patients, and mechanisms whereby intestinal tissue-resident eosinophils might engage food or aero-allergens and participate in EGID pathogenesis remain speculative. At the core of this proposal are our two novel findings that: 1) Identify Notch signaling as a core pathway that orchestrates eosinophil migration and persistence within tissues; and 2) Demonstrate intestinal eosinophils capture intestinal lumen-derived antigen through a process requiring antigen-specific IgG and eosinophil-expressed Fc?RIII in vivo, constitutively express antigen presenting cell machinery, and co-localize with T cells following oral allergen challenge. A logical extension of our published and preliminary data, Aim I of this R01 proposal defines the mechanisms whereby Notch signaling regulates eosinophil migration and survival within tissues and tests the efficacies of targeting eosinophil-expressed Notch receptors in preventing EGIDs in vivo. Fully supported by our preliminary data, experiments in Aim II extend our findings that non-IgE humoral immunity provides a direct link between food allergen triggers and tissue eosinophils to test a new paradigm whereby intestinal eosinophils engage in antigen-driven degranulation and direct antigen presenting cell functions that impact the immunopathogenesis of EGIDs by affecting the local repertoire and spatial arrangement of CD4+ T cells. This proposal utilizes a number of genetic manipulations in Aims I and II to systematically test our hypotheses in vivo using three antigenically and anatomically distinct models of EGIDs. In a complementary parallel approach, Aim III utilizes eosinophils isolated from human ileal tissues and humanized transgenic mice to confirm the direct relevance of our data to human disease, and to evaluate the fidelity of the mouse as a model for antigen-driven functions of human intestinal eosinophils."

Preliminary studies: In a pilot study in the SHS, arsenic metabolism, measured by the relative proportion of arsenic species in urine, was associated with global DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation and arsenic exposure was associated with a hypomethylated region of AS3MT, the gene that codes a major methyltransferase involved in arsenic metabolism. In linkage and fine-mapping studies, genetic variants in the AS3MT region of the genome were associated with urine measures of arsenic metabolism. Design and setting: Population-based prospective cohort study of American Indian men and women from Arizona, Oklahoma and North/South Dakota recruited in 1989-1991 and followed through 2008 as part of the SHS. Data collection: Urine arsenic measures (reflecting long-term exposure), DNA samples to measure epigenetic modifications and genetic polymorphisms, CVD follow-up including coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease and carotid plaque, and extensive data characterizing CVD and its risk factors are available. Epigenetic assessment: We will measure genome- wide blood DNA methylation at baseline using state-of-the-art high throughput technology to identify specific DNA methylation that may mediate the relationship between arsenic and incident CVD endpoints and validate the most promising regions using bisulfite pyrosequencing. Genetic assessment: We will measure 96 SNPs previously related to arsenic metabolism and toxicity in the Strong Heart Family Study, conducted in the same communities as the SHS. SNPs in candidate genes related to CVD are already available in the SHS. Statistical analysis: To evaluate if DNA epigenetic modifications mediate the association between arsenic and CVD, the following conditions will need to be met: (1) arsenic is associated with CVD (already confirmed), (2) arsenic is associated with DNA methylation, (3) DNA methylation is associated with CVD, conditional on arsenic exposure, and (4) attenuation of the arsenic-CVD association conditional on DNA methylation. Gene- epigene interactions will be assessed via general linear models and likelihood ratio tests. Significance: By investigating the contribution of arsenic epigenetics to CVD, this study can reveal novel mechanisms for arsenic health effects, identify susceptible populations, and inform risk assessment, with implications for the prevention and control of arsenic exposure in drinking water and food in the US and abroad."
"9240587","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This project is a combined design-driven and hypothesis-driven project to bioengineer microscale models of  enteric disease. Starting with the Spence lab's in vitro intestine system that accurately reflects both the  complex cellular makeup and the appropriate layered organization of the human intestine, this project will  provide these 3-Dimensional (3D) Human Intestinal Organoids (HIOs) with physiologicaly soft but confining  mechanical cues as well as microscale fluid perfusion capabilities that will mimic luminal flow, to further induce  physiological structures such as crypts and villi. Both of these properties (constraint, flow) have a significant  impact on intestine development, differentiation and function. Our hypothesis is that by providing a  mechanically confined culture condition and fluid perfusion, as opposed to the free expanding culture with a  static, enclosed lumen as is currently used for HIO formation, that the epithelial layer will self-organize  additional levels of physiological complexity, including as crypts and villi, along with associated spatial  organization of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in crypts and differentiated cells on the villi. Incorporation of  microscale fluid perfusion capabilities in HIO culture devices will also allow precise regulation of intraluminal  flow of nutrients, and long-term colonization with bacteria, and pathogens. Technologically, this project will be  innovative in developing a method (?supersoft lithography?) for reproducibly creating supersoft PDMS  structures with physiological moduli of 1-100 kPa.  To enable closed-loop control for maintenance of tissue homeostasis as well as to provide readouts of tissue  function, this project will also integrate miniature oxygen sensors and electrodes for trans-epithelial electrical  resistance (TEER) measurements. Additionally, sampling capabilities from the interior and exterior of the HIO  will be incorporated to enable off-line measures of fluid and drug absorption/secretion. HIO microscale culture  devices will also facilitate measurement of cytokine production in integrated HIO-immune co-cultures.  Finally, we will demonstrate modularity and utility of the bioengineered and instrumented HIO system by  integrating NAMSED Projects 1, 2 and 3. Specifically, instrumented-HIOs with luminal flow will be generated,  co-cultured with immune cells and colonized by probiotic microbes (Lactobacillus GG, LGG) and/or pathogens  (S.typhimurium). In each co-culture, (probiotic/HIO/immune vs. probiotic/pathogen/HIO/immune), we will test  the ability of the system to generate real-time physiological data by measuring epithelial barrier function  (TEER, FITC-Dextran), oxygen concentration, cytokine production, and finally by examining epithelial invasion  by S.typhimurium. We will also test the utility of this system to screen drugs/compounds by generating  instrumented LGG/S.typhimurium/HIO/immune co-cultures and adding Cefoperazone, an antibiotic that will  selectively target the pathogen S.typhimurium, but not the probiotic LGG. The ability of Cefoperazone to kill  S.typhimurium will be examined by culturing the luminal effluent to determine S.typhimurium colony forming  units before, during and after antibiotic treatment. Finally, when live cultures are terminated, we will harvest the  system and examine cellular and molecular difference between the different groups using immunofluorescence  or qRT-PCR on purified immune cells and epithelium."
"9244842","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Of several cardiovascular manifestations in chronic kidney disease (CKD), thrombosis represents a potentially life threatening complication. CKD environment (uremia) is a profoundly thrombogenic. For example, next to medication noncompliance, CKD is both the second highest risk factor (increasing the risk for stent thrombosis by 6-10 folds) and an independent risk factor, which strongly suggests the presence of CKD-specific mediators. Despite its magnitude (more than 20 million people, 10% of US population with CKD) and adverse repercussions on the national public health system, mediators of uremic thrombosis have remained elusive, hampering the progress in the fields of predictive biomarkers. Furthermore, anti-thrombotic therapeutics in CKD also poses challenges. Antiplatelet and antithrombotic agents exhibit suboptimal efficacy in CKD patients, underscoring a need for a CKD-specific therapeutic target. Therefore, thrombosis in CKD is an area of high unmet clinical need both from pathogenic and therapeutic perspectives. CKD is characterized by retention of several solutes/metabolites called `uremic solutes/toxins'. Highly protein-bound nature of some of them precludes their effective clearance with dialysis. Thus, perturbing their intracellular signaling represents the most practical approach to abate the induced thrombogenicity.  We were the first to identify the prothrombotic property of indolic solutes such as indoxyl sulfate (IS), which induce tissue factor (TF, a potent procoagulant) to enhance thrombosis. Our very recent work uncovered Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AHR) as a key mediator of this regulation and supported IS-AHR-TF, a CKD- specific thrombosis axis. A novel panel of AHR blockers (AHRBs) showed anti-thrombotic activities. The present proposal examines this uremic thrombosis axis mechanistically and translationally leveraging animal models and samples from a large cohort of human patients. Aim 1 performs a mechanistic deconvolution of TF regulation by AHR, Aim 2 examines the in vivo relevance of AHR-TF-thrombosis in animal models of CKD, and Aim 3 correlates the serum IS, IA levels, AHR and TF activities with post-angioplasty thrombosis in Thrombosis in Myocardial Infarction-II (TIMI)-II cohort. This will be first study to analyze the uremic metabolites and validate IS-AHR-TF-thrombosis axis in a large US cohort. The present study will also support IS as a potential biomarker and AHR as a therapeutic target for uremic thrombosis. This interdisciplinary application will be facilitated by expertise of Drs. Vipul Chitalia, PI; a nephrologist and a junio physician-scientist focused on thrombosis in CKD patients), Katya Ravid, in platelet and vascular biology (co-investigator), David Sherr (co-investigator), in AHR biology, and Janice Weinberg, expert in Biostatistics and analysis of clinical studies; and consultants - David Salant, an experienced investigator in CKD animal models, Elazer Edelman, an experienced investigator in stent thrombosis and Naomi Hamburg, a clinical epidemiologist and cardiologist experienced in various translational cardiovascular studies such as Framingham Heart Study."
"9234064","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The general goals of this project are to illuminate the nature and functions of memory, and to examine how memory is used to create mental simulations of possible future and past experiences. Recent evidence indicates that the same brain network is involved in both remembering past personal experiences (episodic memory), and imagining or simulating hypothetical experiences that might occur in the future or might have occurred in the past (episodic simulation). The proposed experiments take a cognitive neuroscience approach that links together cognitive and neural processes to understand episodic memory and episodic simulation.  One set of experiments will explore how episodic memories are modified or restructured as a consequence of retrieving them from alternative perspectives: either a field perspective (through one's own eyes) or an observer perspective (an external vantage point). These experiments will also examine the hypothesis that restructuring of episodic memories and constructions of episodic simulations rely on common underlying processes, applying a technique that analyzes repetition-related reductions in brain activity. A second set of experiments will use an episodic specificity induction: brief training in recollecting specific details of recent experiences that selectively increases the number of episodic details (e.g., what happened, where it happened) that participants provide on later tasks which require recalling episodic memories of actual past events or constructing episodic simulations of possible future events, while having no effect on retrieval of semantic details (e.g., related facts or reflections) and no effect on a task that requires describing a picture. Ths the specificity induction represents a promising means of selectively targeting episodic retrieval processes. Proposed experiments will test hypotheses concerning a specific brain subsystem that may be affected by the induction and whether the induction affects primarily the initial construction or subsequent elaboration of remembered or simulated events. The final set of studies will test hypotheses concerning a region that has been consistently linked with episodic memory and simulation, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, but whose role in these processes remains poorly understood. These experiments will explore the idea that this region facilitates access to prior affective knowledge so that individuals can simulate what it might feel like to experience a future episode. For example, one study will test the hypothesis that greater activation in ventromedial prefrontal cortex is observed with greater familiarity of the people and places that comprise episodic simulations, and that this activity also increases with greater anticipated pleasantness of the simulated episode. Another study will explore how this region contributes to the affective quality of a simulated episode.  Overall, these experiments should both enhance understanding of basic processes involved in episodic memory and episodic simulation, and could also provide insights relevant to clinical conditions in which episodic memory and simulation are impaired."
"9348533","Project Summary/Abstract Erythroferrone (ERFE), the erythroid regulator of hepcidin has recently been discovered and characterized as a hormone expressed in erythroblasts in the marrow. ERFE responds to erythropoietin (EPO) signaling from the EPO receptors in the marrow that stimulate ERFE synthesis and release into the plasma. ERFE then acts as a suppressor of hepcidin expression in the liver. Hepcidin is the master regulator of iron absorption from the diet and iron recycling of red blood cells (RBCs) by macrophages. Thus, ERFE as a suppressor of hepcidin, acts to increase iron absorption from the diet and plasma iron concentrations by freeing iron from stores in hepatocytes. ERFE was discovered in phlebotomized mice as a hormone involved with stress erythropoiesis following hemorrhage and was shown to be highly elevated from near undetectable levels at baseline in mouse models of ?-thalassemia and ineffective erythropoiesis. Intrinsic LifeSciences licensed patent-pending ERFE technology from UCLA and has subsequently developed a small suite of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed at ERFE. Using a pair of these mAbs we produced a mAb sandwich research use only (RUO) ELISA and began technical validation and clinical assessment of the kit. This proposal presents Preliminary Data supporting the technical quality of the ERFE test as well as its potential clinical utility. We recapitulated the mouse phlebotomy experiments by sampling serum ERFE before and after plasma apheresis in blood donors and established the preliminary normal range for ERFE in humans in serum samples from first-time blood donors. We also established a preliminary lower limit of detection (LLOD) and lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of 0.1 and 0.15 ng/ml. The median value of the normal range was observed to be 0.8 ng/ml. This suggests that the ERFE sandwich ELSA is sensitive and suitable for commercial development. We confirmed clinical significance of the ERFE sandwich ELISA with de-identified samples from ?-thalassemia and X-linked sideroblastic anemia (XLSA) patients. The PI is requesting Direct to Phase II SBIR funding under PAR-14-088 to continue our exciting research and development efforts on the ERFE monoclonal sandwich ELISA over the next two years. Our experience to date with the ERFE assay indicates that our research strategy is feasible and we expect the outcome of our Phase II R&D studies will be a fully automated clinical ERFE laboratory developed test (LDT) validated under Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) and College of American Pathologists (CAP) guidelines. The CLIA/CAP-validated LDT would be available to healthcare providers in the US and would guide development and validation of a RUO kit for basic biology studies of ERFE in various disease states. An additional deliverable will be a set of Design Controls necessary to manufacture a monoclonal sandwich IVD for ERFE that is suitable for FDA-clearance. We believe that our ERFE IVD will gain widespread clinical use for detection of ineffective erythropoiesis and as an important clinical diagnostic test for ?-thalassemia syndromes."
"9333839","Abstract The research proposed here is in the area of cancer predisposition genetics, and its focus is on the moderate- risk cancer susceptibility genes (ATM, CHEK2, etc.) in the biochemical pathway responsible for DNA double strand break homologous recombination repair (HRR). Most of the genes in the HRR pathway are breast cancer susceptibility genes, with several also being ovarian cancer susceptibility genes and/or pancreatic cancer susceptibility genes. ¶ In the first funding cycle, we discovered that the majority of pathogenic alleles in the moderate-risk HRR genes are individually rare missense substitutions (rather than the individually rare protein truncating variants that dominate the mutation spectrum of BRCA1 and BRCA2). From a clinical cancer genetics and patient counseling point of view, this observation creates a serious problem: the clinical testing labs typically report these rare missense substitutions as Variants of Unclear Significance (VUS). Because the VUS are not used for patient counseling, this means that the majority of the bona fide genetic risk detectable in the moderate-risk HRR genes by the panel tests is not used for patient counseling and risk management! ¶ Over the last 12 years, we played a central role in development of methods for clinical classification of VUS in BRCA1 and BRCA2, and are currently developing corresponding methods for the colorectal (and other cancer) susceptibility genes MLH1, MSH2, PMS2, and MSH6. Here, we hypothesize that combining improved computational methods for rare missense substitution evaluation with comprehensive high-throughput functional assays will dramatically accelerate the process of evaluation and classification of clinically observed VUS. Thus the first Aim of the project focuses on confirming and then improving the accuracy of computational methods for evaluation of rare missense substitution. The second Aim is directed towards development of medium-to-high throughput assays of missense substitution functionality. In terms of genes, we will begin these studies with the RING domain of BRCA1 (which lacks a properly calibrated functional assay), and then progress to ATM and then CHEK2. In the third Aim, we re-calibrate the outputs from the computational methods of Aim 1 and the functional assays of Aim 2 into probabilities (or odds) in favor of pathogenicity, the key variables required for clinical-quality classification of sequence variants observed in people. We then combine these data to obtain posterior probabilities in favor of pathogenicity and pass those posterior probabilities through a well-recognized categorical classifier (the IARC standards) to generate classification recommendations for clinicians and patients. Progress across the three Aims of this study will dramatically accelerate variant classification while simultaneously improving the sensitivity and precision of the clinical testing process."
"9440724","Project Summary This is the second renewal application for the UC Davis postdoctoral T32 program in Oncogenic Signals and Chromosome Biology seeking funding for years 11-15. This training program takes advantage of the integrated strength of the Molecular Oncology Program at the UC Davis NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center and the exceptional expertise and training records of the participating faculty members in oncogenic signals and chromosome biology. The program involves 18 trainers, including two National Academy members and one HHMI Investigator, plus five junior mentors in an effort to develop the next generation of trainers. Every trainer maintains an active, extramurally funded research program. The translational aspects of this program are facilitated by a strong clinical research component at the Cancer Center, with further support from the UC Davis Clinical and Translational Science Center. Over the first two funding periods, the training program appointed an outstanding cohort of 27 highly talented postdoctoral fellows including 8 from underrepresented minorities and 8 fellows who crossed into cancer biology from very different areas of science. Remarkably, 9 fellows obtained competitive, individual fellowships to continue their training in cancer biology. The training program has developed an innovative and effective array of curricular activities that insures individual flexibility and provides formal training in oncogenic signals and chromosome biology, education in the responsible conduct of research, as well as individualized mentoring and career development. Included in the training curriculum are a rich and diverse array of seminars, conferences, discussion groups, workshops, and retreats that provide opportunities to present research progress and broaden the training experience beyond the trainer's laboratory. The training program added significant value to the university, as it serviced a cohort of 138 including 39 training grant eligible postdoctoral fellows in the last funding period, who actively participate in some training grant activities. An effective administrative structure is in place that is further refined in this renewal. A director administers the program with guidance by an active executive committee, each member of which actively maintains a specific portfolio to enhance the program activities. To further develop the training program, we employ the help of a four-member Advisory Board. The two external advisors have experience as directors of comparable cancer-oriented training programs. The two internal members are highly experienced mentors and include the Vice Dean of the School of Medicine, who is an authority in mentoring and co-PI of the UC Davis BEST/Future grant supported by NIH. The training program aims to prepare our trainees for rewarding careers in the biomedical workforce and empower them to make informed decisions of the breadth of possible career tracks."
"9230369","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Apoptosis is normally considered a barrier for carcinogenesis because of its roles in getting rid of unwanted or damaged cells. However recent discoveries in our laboratory suggest that we need to re-examine the roles of apoptosis, especially those of apoptotic caspases, in carcinogenesis. In this project, we will examine the hypothesis that non-lethal caspase 3 or 7 activation induces genomic instability to facilitate radiation and other stress-induced carcinogenesis. Our hypothesis is a bold one that goes against the current paradigm. It will have wide-ranging implications since many endogenous and external stimuli could activate apoptotic caspases. Examples of such stimuli include exposure to ionizing radiation, UV, chemicals, and oncogene expression (e.g., myc). A facilitative role for caspases in carcinogenesis would provide exciting new insights into how those diverse environmental insults cause cancer. We will use a variety of in vitro and in vivo models, in combination with state-of-the-art molecular technologies, to examine the roles of caspases 3&7 in radiation- and other stress-induced genetic instability and carcinogenesis. We expect our studies to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the roles of caspases 3&7 in promoting carcinogenesis through inducing genetic instability. Upon completion of the project, we hope we can gain significant insights into the roles of apoptotic caspases in carcinogenesis. Such insights may provide novel targets for future cancer prevention strategies."
"9249683","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human Pluripotent Stem cells (hPSCs), including embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and especially, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) established from patient's tissues, offer a new research tool for understanding disease pathogenesis, a versatile template for drug discovery, and a promising source of cell therapy. A key step in realizing these potentials of human PSCs is genetic modification / gene targeting, as in the creation of transgenic animals that has revolutionized biomedical research and discovery. Unlike their mouse counterparts, transgenesis of hPSCs is inefficient and the transgene expression is often not stable, especially upon neural differentiation, let alone functional regulation. Technical difficulties in genetically modifying hPSCs and unavailability of commonly needed hPSC lines, as opposed to readily available transgenic animals, have become a significant barrier to neuroscience research. The present proposal aims to overcome these hurdles by building and distributing transgenic hPSCs and related reagents. Building upon our decade's experience in hPSC research, we will first establish hESC lines with a (GFP) reporter in neural genes that are most frequently sought by investigators in neuroscience using the TALEN- or CRISPR/CAS-mediated homologous recombination technology (Aim 1). We will also build hPSC lines with a functional regulator in an envy site under the control of a neural promoter (Aim 2), which will allow interrogation of the function of human neural cells in vitro and in vivo. These cell lines will be distributed through the WiCell Institute or an NIH designated distribution center (e.g., Rutgers University Cell and DNA Repository [RUCDR]). To promote neuroscience research in a broad spectrum as well as that involving specialized model systems (e.g., disease iPSCs), we will further deposit the transgenic reagents that are proven effective through Addegene for dissemination (Aim 3). Availability of such hPSC lines and tools will substantially speed up the next wave of neuroscience discovery in a cost effective manner and enable translation to clinical neuroscience."
"9251139","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescent marijuana use is a prominent public health concern. Indeed, exposure to marijuana during adolescence is correlated with drug abuse and addiction in adulthood and predicts future cocaine abuse. Changing national attitudes on marijuana use and the resultant push for the reform of marijuana laws (23 states and the District of Columbia currently have legalized marijuana in some form) highlight a need to examine the long-term neurobiological consequences of cannabinoid exposure. I have collected preliminary data showing that adolescent exposure to a cannabinoid agonist disrupts the experience of cocaine reward in adulthood and results in cocaine-induced conditioned place aversion. These data confirm the work of others showing that cannabinoid exposure in adolescence disturbs normal brain development and produces lasting effects on behavior. In this study, we intend to utilize cutting-edge electrochemical and optogenetic techniques to investigate the effects of cannabinoid exposure in adolescence on cocaine experience and reinforcement in adulthood. Specific aim 1 utilizes pharmacological manipulations to determine if cannabinoid exposure in adolescence exerts its effects on adult cocaine experience through actions at CB1 receptors. In the same animals we will employ the electrochemical technique fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to measure whether cannabinoid exposure during adolescence changes subsecond dopamine release evoked by cocaine and cocaine-associated contextual cues and assess how cannabinoid exposure affects the initiation and escalation of cocaine self-administration. Specific aim 2 uses optogenetic tools to test whether cannabinoids alter cocaine experience through disruption of dopaminergic function. Altogether these experiments will provide novel information concerning the neural mechanisms through which cannabinoid exposure in adolescence disturbs brain development and influences cocaine reward and reinforcement in adulthood."
"9221320","During the past funding cycle, the establishment of the services provided by the Cell Biology Core has  fostered a large variety of research related to the Core Objectives. Cell Biological Studies related to the  DRTC have expanded within the research community as evidenced by publications as well as grant  applications from investigatoVs who traditionally do not work in the area of diabetes mellitus and metabolism.  The adipose tissue bank and adipose biology expertise and service of the DRTC was transferred to operate  under the auspices of the newly funded Mid-Atlantic nutrition and obesity research center (NORC) at the  University of Maryland. This ensured a strengthening and continuity of adipose tissue related services to the  DRTC community while freeing resources, which were used for innovation and expansion of services  through the Cell Biology Core of the Baltimore DRTC. The Cell Biology Core started a local repository of  transgenic mouse models of tissue/cell specific transgenic CRE -deleter ordoxycylcine regulatable mice.  These well-characterized mice, in the C57BI/6 background, have become a valuable resource for the  research community. Responding to investigators' needs as well as to pertinent questions related to  metabolism and diabetes mellitus, the Cell Biology has expanded its services and expertise in the area of  cellular bioenergetics and mitochondrial biology. This new addition will provide expertise and services to  image and quantify mitochondrial content and mitochondrial shape and constellation, to assess  mitochondrial dynamics (fusion and division), provide expertise in quantification of mitochondrial gene and  protein expression (e.g. uncoupling proteins, complexes of the electron transfer chain) and cellular  mitochondrial DNA content. In addition DRC users will gain access to unique genetic mouse models (e.g.  floxed Drp1, floxeci Opal mice), which allow conditional tissue specific ablation of proteins involved in  mitochondrial fusion and division and in mediating apoptosis in response to oxidative cellular stress."
"9349402","Abstract In searching for the protein mediating the innate CD8+ cell non-cytotoxic anti-HIV response (CNAR) we have discovered that the external portion of CD137 (4-1BB) is a soluble protein that can induce a cellular antiviral state that prevents HIV replication. The full-length membrane-bound CD137 does not trigger this activity. The interaction of CD137 with its ligand, CD137L activates the cells expressing CD137, particularly T lymphocytes. The role of sCD137 is not known. sCD137 inhibits replication of all HIV isolates tested as well as polio, adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, and VSV. It is only active in human and primate cells and blocks virus replication at the transcription level. sCD137 can be found naturally in the blood of some individuals. Timing experiments have suggested that sCD137 can induce this antiviral state within a few hours after the exposure of human cells. Pilot studies have indicated that CD137L antibodies block the induction of the antiviral state by sCD137. Our hypothesis is that sCD137 interacts with the ligand CD137L on the cell surface to induce an intracellular antiviral state. Our proposed studies are aimed at confirming this hypothesis through #1, Using RNA-Seq, to determine the intracellular pathway responsible for the sCD137-induced antiviral state and #2, Using CRISPR- Cas9, to confirm that the sCD137/CD137L interaction is involved in inducing the antiviral state. These studies offer a new direction in antiviral immunotherapy that could be effective alone or in combination with antiretroviral therapy. Soluble CD137 could also be effective in shock and kill cure strategies in which the spread of the activated virus to uninfected cells could be controlled.  "
"9246665","PROJECT SUMMARY: Scientific summary: The 5-HT2-serotonin and D2-dopamine families of receptors represent essential targets for most atypical antipsychotics as well as drugs useful in treating obesity, sleep disorders, psychosis and autistic-spectrum disorders. It is currently unknown how these drugs interact with their target receptors. Here we aim to obtain high resolution structures of 5-HT2A- and 5-HT2B- serotonin and D2- and D4-dopamine receptors with an array of small molecules. These studies are both innovative technically and conceptually by providing an unprecedented understanding of the molecular and atomic details responsible for psychoactive drug actions. Technical achievements will include the structure of LSD in complex with its key serotonin receptor targets and typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs in complex with their serotonin and dopamine receptor targets. Additionally, models which attempt to explain ligand-specific properties of biased signaling from the perspective of ligand-receptor interactions will be tested by a combination of direct structural studies, molecular modeling, docking, site-directed mutagenesis and functional studies. We anticipate that our studies will reveal key ligand-receptor interactions essential for biased signaling for serotonin and dopamine receptors. Elucidating the molecular details for such interactions provides a template for the structure-guided design of novel therapeutics."
"9198762","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malignant melanoma is one of the most aggressive types of cancers. Its ability to metastasize and resistance to anticancer chemotherapy makes melanoma extremely difficult to cure. Additionally, there are no reliable molecular markers associated with melanoma progression. Invasion as a prerequisite for metastasis, is one of the most detrimental features of melanoma. Recently, using cultured cells, experimental animals and analysis of human melanoma specimens, we have identified guanosine monophosphate reductase (GMPR) as a suppressor of melanoma invasion. Our preliminary data show that functional antagonist of GMPR, guanosine monophosphate synthase (GMPS), is overexpressed in human metastatic melanomas and is required for melanoma cell invasion and growth of human melanoma xenografts in nude mice. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a relatively understudied chemical inhibitor of GMPS, decoyinine, reduces melanoma cell invasion. Moreover, our analysis of publically available databases identified several other guanylate metabolism enzymes that differentially express in primary and metastatic melanoma specimens. C-MYC is a transcription factor that regulates expression of multiple genes involved in promotion of proliferation, and augmentation of cellular metabolism, including biosynthesis of nucleotides. Up-regulation of C-MYC levels is one of the most frequent events in human malignancies including metastatic melanoma. Preliminary data in our laboratory suggested that GMPR is a C-MYC-responsive gene and that long-term GMPR suppression is mediated by epigenetic regulation. Therefore our central hypothesis is that progression to metastatic melanoma is facilitated by distortion of guanylate pools through disruption of normal biosynthetic pathways at multiple points. Our long term goal is to develop novel therapeutic approaches to treat or prevent metastatic melanoma, as well as to identify a set of biomarkers for early diagnosis of metastatic potential. Our objectives in the current proposal are i) to investigate the therapeutic potential of pharmacological inhibition of GMPS; ii) to characterize several rate- limiting enzymes involved in guanylate metabolism as potential melanoma markers and iii) to identify mechanisms underlying transcriptional suppression of GMPR in melanoma cells. To achieve these goals we propose the following three specific aims: 1) To determine the efficacy of the GMPS inhibitor decoyinine against melanoma xenografts in immunocompromised mice 2) To determine the prognostic value of enzymes involved in guanylate metabolism for overall survival (OS) of primary melanoma patients. 3)To investigate the mechanisms of GMPR regulation and the role of GMPR in MYC-dependent up-regulation of invasion. Melanoma is one of the incurable types of human cancers with no reliable prognostic molecular markers. Our proposed research will characterize a promising new target for melanoma therapy, discover new mechanisms underlying melanoma invasion, and identify new prognostic factors for melanoma patients."
"9345014","PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Three lessons of the PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) clinical trials - that adherence is critical to effectiveness, that pharmacologic adherence measures are more reliable than self-report, and that daily pill-taking is difficult ?must be applied to the next phase of HIV prevention research. This phase will investigate oral PrEP roll-out and optimization in high incidence settings, as well as novel long-acting methods for preventing HIV infection, such as injectables or vaginal rings. The vaginal ring prevented HIV acquisition in two recent trials, but poor adherence to consistent ring insertion dampened overall effectiveness. Injectable PrEP with long-acting cabotegravir is of interest, but will require adequate drug levels to be effective, especially at the end of dosing intervals and with missed visits. Pharmacologic metrics integrate biology (pharmacokinetics, PK) and behavior (adherence) and will be crucial to interpreting effectiveness with real-world oral PrEP, rings and injectables.  Our group has helped pioneer the use of small hair samples (which are easy to collect, store and ship) to monitor exposure (PK) and adherence to antiretrovirals (ARVs). During the first funding period of this R01, we made significant progress on our original aims, demonstrating that hair levels of ARVs, which monitor long-term exposure, are stronger predictors of treatment success than self-reported adherence (or plasma levels) in HIV-infected pregnant women, children, and adults. We have also shown preliminary utility of hair levels of tenofovir (TFV)/emtricitabine (FTC) to monitor adherence and toxicities with oral PrEP.  This proposal will leverage three important trials to explore key knowledge gaps that will arise in the next phase of HIV prevention work: The Sustainable East Africa Research in Community Health (SEARCH) trial (Dr. Havlir, chair and co-I) has just launched a large study providing oral PrEP to at-risk individuals in 16 communities in Africa. The HIV Open-Label Prevention Extension (HOPE) study in the Microbicide Trials Network (MTN) (Dr. Baeten, chair and co-I) will assess open-label use of the dapivirine vaginal ring. The Long-Acting Antiretroviral Therapy in Non-adherent HIV-Infected Individuals Trial (A5359, Dr. Castillo- Mancilla, co-chair and co-I)) in the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) will examine long-acting injectables in HIV-infected patients with a history of poor adherence. All 3 trials will collect hair and plasma for drug levels, and track robust outcomes, to allow us to 1) investigate hair levels as metrics of adherence with the vaginal ring and oral PrEP in Africa and examine patterns of adherence (e.g. daily, around periods of risk, just prior to visits) by combining data in plasma and hair; and 2) examine hair levels as easy-to-collect metrics for PK monitoring with the use of injectables. The overarching goal of this renewal is to develop an integrated package of highly predictive biologic adherence and pharmacokinetic measures spanning PrEP delivery methods and optimization strategies. Defining predictors and patterns of adherence to oral PrEP and rings, as well as metrics to monitor PK with injectables, will inform public health interventions in HIV prevention."
"9331052","The 29th Fungal Genetics Conference will be held at the Asilomar Conference Center from March 14-19, 2017. This conference is one of the longest running and premiere meetings for fungal biologists. Approximately 950 scientists and students from around the US and the world will attend. A primary goal of this biennial meeting is to promote the dissemination of the latest research on all aspects of the biology of fungi with a focus on filamentous fungi. Another important goal is to promote communication and collaboration between Medical Mycologists and those working with fungal plant pathogens, saprotrophic fungi and symbiotic fungi. This has led to significant recruitment of mycologists to join the Medical Mycology research community.

"9393244","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     UCSF and Kaiser Permanente Northern California are teaming up to create the Northern California Regional Coordinating Stroke Center (NorCal-CSC) as one of the 25 sites in consideration for the Stroke Trials Network. NorCal-CSC combines the brain trust of stroke researchers at UCSF and Kaiser and leverages the infrastructure for multicenter research at these institutions that is already in existence. UCSF has been a leader in stroke research for over 2 decades; the creation of NorCal-CSC allows our combined efforts to crystalize into an efficient center that has expertise in Phase 1 and 2 trials and broad access to patient populations for large phase 3 trials as well. Kaiser Permanente Northern California covers over 3 million lives as registered patients, and coupled with a high-quality comprehensive electronic medical record, our  ability to recruit patients for phase 3 trials of prevention and recovery is likely unparalleled. NorCal-CSC has many leaders in academic stroke research including Dr. S. Claiborne Johnston, Dr. Donald Easton and Dr. Wade Smith (PI) who will solicit fresh, meaningful clinical trial ideas from the broad range of stroke researchers at UCSF and Kaiser and present these to the STN as a whole for consideration. These leaders have led major, multi-center clinical trials and have extensive experience with the NIH funded NETT. This involvement with the NETT provides excellent experience to maintain a similar U-10 supported infrastructure for stroke research. NorCal-CSC will combine UC Medical Center (UCMC), San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH), UC-Fresno, and 2 Kaiser hospitals - all of which have primary stroke center status. Additionally, 3 of these hospitals have endovascular capability and all have capacity for advanced neuroimaging. Northern California is racially diverse with Asian (10-33%) and Hispanic patients (9-50%) representing significant populations across our sites; this racial diversity allows NorCal-CSC to study stroke prevention, treatment and recovery in these diverse populations. NorCal-CSC will also provide an accredited 2-year vascular neurology fellowship that includes advanced training in clinical trial design, trial implementation and center administration so as to prepare these individuals as leaders of stroke research in the future."
"9316124","Estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast tumors are treated with endocrine therapies which specifically target the ER. Patients can remain disease-free for many years; however, resistance to treatment eventually develops, and the majority of women will suffer a recurrence of metastatic cancer. We hypothesized that the key to the long-term treatment of women with ER-positive breast cancers was to focus on identifying novel mechanisms of resistance using metastatic tumors resistant to therapy where tumor evolution and clonal selection have occurred. We identified the androgen receptor (AR) as a new clinical target which was up regulated in resistant, metastatic tumors. We have learned that AR functionally collaborates with ER, and that resistance may be associated with a failure of hormone therapy to completely block both androgen and estrogen signaling. We have also discovered that AR-overexpressing cells become metastatic in vivo. Furthermore, we were the first to identify that the estrogen receptor ESR1 gene can be mutated in metastatic tumors; acquiring hormone-independent and endocrine therapy-resistant functions which we hypothesize will also be impacted by ligand-independent AR signaling. Importantly, cells with ESR1 mutations also up-regulate AR, demonstrating a unique relationship between these mutations and AR. Our Aims are: (1) To determine if receptor crosstalk (WT or mutant ER with AR) is a mechanism of resistance to hormonal agents, (2) To determine whether AR employs novel nuclear receptor interactions to drive hormone resistance, and (3) To determine AR and ESR1 mutant effects on invasion and metastasis. Key success has been made in developing resistant models with endogenous up regulation of AR coincident with acquired resistance, and we have already identified potential AR-mediated candidate resistance mechanisms. Undoubtedly hormone therapy resistance in patients is multifactorial and will require combination hormonal and targeted therapy along with knowledge of the activation status of key pathways, such as those arising from mutations in ER in metastatic tumors. Our work will impact a large number of women with ER-positive breast cancer who recur with therapy-resistant disease."
"9230361","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Addition, anxiety, neuropathic pain and Alzheimer's disease have each been shown to share some important common features such as changes in synapse number and defectives regulation of the function or localization of the NMDAR. Remarkably EphB and ephrin-B proteins appear to be important candidate genes in the control of these events during development, in the mature brain, and in these diverse diseases. Yet, our understanding of the mechanisms by which ephrin-Bs and EphB control the events even under normal conditions is rudimentary. Therefore we will focus on two issues (1) how the EphB receptor regulates NMDAR localization and function at synapses and (2) how neurons control the number of synapses they receive. To answer these questions we propose three specific aims: 1. Determine whether a specific domain in EphB2 is necessary and sufficient to control the EphB-NMDAR interaction. 2. Determine whether a specific domain in NR1 is necessary to control the EphB-NMDAR interaction. 3. Determine the molecular mechanisms mediating ephrin-B3 dependent control of synapse density Results from our experiments will provide fundamental insights into mechanisms that control and specify the formation and function of synaptic connections within the brain. In addition, given that EphB/ephrinB can mediate synaptic and structural plasticity, that their expression is regulated by drugs of abuse, and EphBs regulation of NMDAR function has been linked to opiate addiction, our studies will advance understanding of drug-induced pathology and will likely have broad impact on human health."
"9223725","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The large arteries function as elastic reservoirs for blood ejected by the heart. They distend during systole and relax during diastole, pushing blood to distal vessels and dampening the pressure pulse wave. This windkessel function also reduces left ventricular (LV) afterload and improves coronary blood flow and LV relaxation. In disease and aging, arterial compliance is reduced, which compromises the arterial windkessel function and increases the risk of death from heart disease. Recent evidence suggests that local decreases in compliance of the ascending aorta alone, rather than global decreases in arterial compliance, can cause adverse effects on cardiac function. The aortic compliance depends on the applied blood pressure, geometry, and material properties of the wall. The passive material properties are determined mostly by the amount and organization of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, including elastin and collagen. One way useful way to quantify the aortic material properties is to calculate the slope, or modulus, of the circumferential stretch-stress curve at physiologic pressure. Experimental evidence shows that this modulus is constant across different developmental ages, mouse models of human disease, and organisms, suggesting a universal elastic modulus that is a physiological design constraint. We hypothesize that the need to maintain a constant elastic modulus directs the construction of the ascending aorta to minimize LV afterload and the work done by the heart. We propose that smooth muscle cells (SMCs) orchestrate this process by directed growth and proliferation, and production of ECM proteins in the right amount, location, and organization to create an aortic wall with specific material properties and that this process is regulated through TGF-ß activity. We postulate that mathematical models incorporating hemodynamic forces, mechanical behavior, and physiological constants, can be used to better understand and predict this growth and remodeling process. We will test our hypothesis using novel mouse models in which elastin amounts and timing can be modulated. By understanding how SMCs create and maintain the aortic wall with a universal elastic modulus, and the extreme conditions in which the modulus cannot be maintained, we can gain information that will be useful in treating cardiovascular diseases related to decrease aortic compliance. These diseases include genetic defects that specifically alter the available ECM proteins for wall construction (i.e. supravalvular aortic stenosis, Marfan Syndrome, and vascular tortuosity syndromes), as well as those related to general decreases in compliance, such as coarctation of the aorta and systolic hypertension. Our specific aims are to: 1) Determine how the need to maintain a universal elastic modulus directs aortic wall growth through regulation of TGF-ß activity; 2) Quantify how elastin and collagen amounts and organization interact to maintain a universal elastic modulus; 3) Integrate mechanical and physiological data into a mathematical model of aortic growth and remodeling."
"9231376","Filoviruses and arenaviruses are two major families of lethal hemorrhagic fever viruses for which no vaccines or treatments are currently available. Previous work by several investigators involved in this proposal has unequivocally demonstrated the feasibility of protecting non-human primates against viral challenge with immunotherapy. This highly translational proposal will identify the most effective monoclonal antibodies and from them, create broad-spectrum antibody cocktails for pre- or post-exposure use. To achieve this goal, we will leverage the consortium's large collection of anti-filovirus and anti-arenavirus antibodies, as well as new antibodies to be derived from ongoing and proposed discovery efforts. However, it will not be feasible to test each of our hundreds of candidate antibodies and thousands of potential antibody combinations in animals without some initial in vitro downselection. To generate a manageable set of candidate antibodies and cocktails, Core C (working together the three project teams and the Gore D team) will categorize antibodies into structural and functional groups, perform rules-based triage of antibody candidates, and design antibody cocktails based on antiviral activity and functional diversity. Finally and importantly. Core C will prioritize candidate cocktails based on their susceptibility to escape mutations, and will, together with Core D, identify antibodies most resistant to escape, as well as replacement antibodies that will mop up escaping virions. In addition to selection of the most effective single antibodies and cocktails of antibodies to forward for patient use, this Gore will provide essential information that addresses major, basic knowledge gaps in the field. Our comprehensive analysis will illustrate which epitopes lead to the most effective protection, which in vitro assays are the best predictors of in vivo efficacy, and which epitopes lead to broad-spectrum reactivity and protection."
"9329890","Abstract  Health disparities exist among segments of the population, including differences by gender, race/ethnicity, education or income, disability, geographic location, and sexual orientation. Increasing the number of underrepresented persons, including African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, and Native Americans, disabled, and those from low income backgrounds, in science- and healthcare-related fields is critical to closing these gaps, in meeting the needs of our increasingly diverse society, and raising the cultural competence of all scientists and health practitioners. However, while minority interest in science matches or exceeds that of whites, individuals of color and from disadvantaged backgrounds are underrepresented in higher education, and in particular science education. Providing high school students with opportunities for exposure to scientific environments and mentorship from scientists is key in developing a passion for and sustained pursuit of education in the sciences. Such opportunities are especially critical in promoting science interest among youth of color. The goal of Stanford's High School Program in Biomedical and Health Sciences, as one of four high school programs within the NIH/NIDDK-funded Short-Term Research Experience Program for Underrepresented Persons (STEP-UP), is to increase the number of youth who are committed to and well- positioned for careers in the sciences. The STEP-UP program provides opportunities for high school students to develop critical thinking and educational skills within a supportive environment in which they have sustained relationships with adults (often university faculty, medical and graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows) as well as peers in the program. Priority is given to recruiting and accepting talented students from populations less represented in the biomedical and health sciences, including students of color, students from low socioeconomic backgrounds, and disabled students. In addition to focusing on improved academic skills, STEP-UP strives to facilitate the development of positive attitudes toward science, scientific skills, and positive relationships with peers and mentors. In STEP-UP, each high school student is paired with an adult scientific mentor, enabling students to obtain first-hand experience in a scientific environment. Students also participate in didactic seminars, tours, and other events aimed at increasing science and education success. Students have opportunities to continue during the academic year as well, through participating in webinars, research, and other mentoring experiences. Since 2007, Dr. Bonnie Halpern-Felsher has been the PI/Program Director for one of four coordinating sites for the high school STEP-UP program. We are applying to continue and expand our coordination of the high school STEP-UP program, and specifically to be one of the coordinating institutions to recruit students from the 48 contiguous United States. The specific aims of our STEP-UP program are to: (1) Recruit and retain 25 11th and 12th grade high school students less represented in the biomedical sciences, including individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, and individuals with disabilities. (2) Provide these students with an 8-10 week program and year-round opportunities that offer mentoring, opportunities for hands-on exposure to scientific research, and exposure to NIDDK-mission areas. (3) Help improve applications for successful college admission among youth who might otherwise have more limited educational choices. (4) Provide all mentors, including graduate and medical students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty, with training in mentoring high school students through formal training and didactic mentoring experiences, thus providing a cadre of mentors well trained and prepared to encourage adolescents to enter the sciences. Providing opportunities for underrepresented groups of youth to enter the science pipeline will not only increase the number of youth from diverse backgrounds entering biomedical and health sciences, it will increase the number of diverse health care professions and scientists overall. Our STEP-UP program emphasizes partnerships and focuses on academic preparation, thereby playing a large role in creating the conditions for success and becoming crucial for addressing the complex problem of underrepresentation in the science and health professions."

"9223697","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Quantitative imaging of cerebral blood flow is essential in preclinical stroke studies for monitoring the efficacy of potential treatments and for understanding the role of vascular reorganization in functional recovery. Similarly, real-time imaging of blood flow is crucial during neurovascular surgery in humans, where intraoperative visualization of vascular patency and tissue perfusion are needed. Laser speckle contrast imaging has become widely used because it provides real-time images with very simple instrumentation and requires no exogenous contrast agents. However, laser speckle imaging is limited to imaging of relative blood flow changes within one subject, and the inability to compare flow across subjects has been a major limitation. We recently introduced an extension to speckle imaging called multi-exposure speckle imaging (MESI), that allowed chronic imaging of cerebral blood flow in mice over many weeks post-stroke. Despite this advance however comparisons across subjects remains challenging due to a lack of understanding of the physical origins of the measured signals. We know that speckle images represent a spatially integrated measure of the underlying microvascular perfusion, but the exact nature of this integration is complex and poorly understood. Exact calibration of MESI requires knowledge of the detailed scattering interactions of every detected photon with every moving particle in the tissue, as well as how each interaction contributes to the overall speckle signal. Clearly this level of detail cannot be determined experimentally. In this project we will combine a set of novel microscopy tools with a physically realistic computational model and together these new tools will allow us to establish this relationship in unprecedented detail and calibrate MESI for absolute blood flow imaging in the cortex. To do this we will create a single microscope to acquire MESI surface images along with three dimensional images of vascular structure using multiphoton fluorescence microscopy, and blood flow measurements in every vessel segment of the cortex using optical coherence tomography. This three-dimensional structural and blood flow information with be used as inputs to a computational model of MESI that will allow us to determine how each vessel segment contributes to the measured MESI signal. We will use these tools to establish absolute calibrations for MESI in mice and use the calibrations to quantify the ability of MESI to detect vascular remodeling in the cortex following stroke. Finally, we will translate MESI imaging to the clinical setting and perform a pilot study of MESI during neurovascular surgical procedures."
"9331958","PROJECT ABSTRACT Although hepatotropic viruses are important causes of human disease, the intrahepatic immune response to hepatitis viruses is poorly understood due to a lack of tractable small animal models. In this Multi-PI application, an experienced virologist teams with an accomplished viral immunologist to propose experiments aimed at better understanding the intrahepatic immune response to a human hepatitis virus using a novel murine model in which hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection of mice lacking the type I interferon (IFN) receptor (Ifnar1-/-) recapitulates critical features of type A hepatitis in humans. Preliminary data from this model demonstrate (1) that the capacity of HAV to evade MAVS-mediated type I interferon (IFN?/?) responses defines its host species range, and (2) that acute HAV-induced liver injury stems from IFN-independent intrinsic hepatocellular apoptosis with secondary inflammation that unexpectedly results from MAVS and IRF3/7 signaling. This new murine model thus reveals a previously undefined link between innate immune responses to virus infection and acute liver injury, providing a novel paradigm for viral pathogenesis in the liver that is likely relevant to other hepatitis viruses. The HAV 3ABC protease cleaves human MAVS, disrupting IFN responses in human cells, but cannot cleave the murine MAVS ortholog due to sequence differences. We hypothesize that this inability of HAV to disrupt murine MAVS-mediated IFN responses renders mice nonpermissive for infection, and will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 using mice with CRISPR/Cas9 editing of the Mavs gene that renders the expressed protein susceptible to 3ABC cleavage. Aim 1 will also define cell types that sense HAV and in which IFN-induced gene expression controls HAV replication in the liver, and ascertain the role played by type III IFN? in countering infection in the liver and intestinal mucosa. Aim 2 will define differences in protective, antiviral IFN-induced transcriptional responses versus pro-pathogenic IRF3-induced gene expression, examine the role of IFIT proteins in the pro-pathogenic response, and determine whether transcription-independent functions of activated IRF3 control infection or drive acute liver injury. Aim 3 will examine the adaptive cellular immune response to HAV infection and how it is linked to the early innate immune response. Aim 3 will address the role of HAV-specific T cells in virus control and define innate mechanisms regulating these responses in the liver. The proposed studies will further refine a unique and valuable animal model and provide novel insight into the interplay between innate and adaptive immunity and acute liver injury in the context of hepatotropic virus infection."
"9214331","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accurate partitioning of the replicated genome to daughter cells during cell division is essential for the development and propagation of all living organisms. Errors in genome distribution are a hallmark of cancer cells and the machinery involved in this process is targeted in cancer chemotherapy. Thus, elucidating the mechanisms ensuring accurate genome distribution will inform our understanding of the genesis of cancer and guide development of new therapeutic strategies. A major player in genome distribution is the kinetochore, the machine built on the centromere regions of chromosomes during mitosis to generate a dynamic end- coupled interface with spindle microtubules. The mechanics at this interface are tightly integrated with a signaling pathway, termed the spindle checkpoint, which prevents cell cycle progression until all chromosomes are connected to the spindle. Microtubule binding and checkpoint signaling are coordinated at the kinetochore by the conserved Knl1/Mis12 complex/Ndc80 complex (KMN) protein network. Within this protein set, the Ndc80 complex interacts directly with microtubule ends. The work proposed here has three goals: 1) to elucidate the mechanisms ensuring accurate formation of Ndc80-mediated kinetochore-microtubule attachments, 2) to define kinetochore-independent essential functions of core checkpoint pathway components, and 3) to determine if enhancing cohesion fatigue is a viable strategy to target cancer cell division. These goals will be addressed in 4 specific aims. Aim 1 will focus on understanding the formation of Ndc80-mediated end-coupled attachments, which are accelerated by lateral capture of microtubules by kinetochore-localized dynein, the major minus end-directed microtubule motor in cells. The proposed work will investigate crosstalk we discovered between the kinetochore dynein module and the Ndc80 complex and determine its significance to chromosome segregation fidelity. Aim 2 will address poorly understood essential functions of the conserved Bub1 kinase and the Ndc80 complex subunit Nuf2 in the formation of kinetochore- microtubule attachments. Aim 3 will focus on the provocative idea, based on our recent findings, that there are essential functions of the spindle checkpoint proteins Mad1 and Mad2 independent of their role in kinetochore- based checkpoint signaling. This aim exploits mechanism-based engineering of the Mad1/Mad2 complex in an organismal context to elucidate the basis for the severe developmental and fertility defects associated with loss of Mad1/Mad2 in C. elegans, which we have shown are independent of kinetochore-localization dependent checkpoint signaling. Finally, Aim 4 builds on our observation that sister chromatids of chromosomes attached to the spindle ultimately become unglued in an uncoordinated manner when mitosis is prolonged; this traps the cell in an aberrant state, termed cohesion fatigue, from which it cannot recover. We will broadly assess if the propensity for cohesion fatigue is increased in cancer cell lines, as suggested by preliminary data, and determine whether enhancing cohesion fatigue could serve as a strategy to target cancer cell division."

"9260072","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Tissues respond in different ways to injury to repair and regenerate lost cells and damaged architecture. The lung responds robustly to injury through activation of spatially restricted stem/progenitor cell populations and through re-entry of differentiated cells into the cell cycle. This robust response to injury stands in contrast to the normal homeostatic state, which is remarkably quiescent. One school of thought suggests that quiescence is a default state in many tissues resulting from lack of growth stimuli as demonstrated in culture conditions. However, this does not fully explain how cells remain quiescent within a complex microenvironment in vivo during tissue homeostasis. An alternative hypothesis is that quiescence is actively maintained through as yet unknown molecular pathways. Such an active process would be important for the delicate balance between cellular quiescence required for maintaining tissue integrity during normal homeostasis and the rapid regenerative response after injury. Such information is important given that disruption in this state could lead to re-activation of cell proliferation in an uncontrolled manner and may underlie several lung diseases including pulmonary fibrosis and cancer. The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is a hallmark signaling pathway that coordinates epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during development in multiple organs including the lung, through paracrine activation of smoothened (Smo)-mediated downstream signaling events. Of the three known Hh ligands, sonic hedgehog (Shh) is the best understood, is highly expressed during lung development, and plays an essential role in lung morphogenesis. Despite its clear role in organ development, little is known about whether or how Hh signaling coordinates epithelial-mesenchymal interactions in the adult lung to maintain tissue homeostasis or modulate injury and regeneration. Hh signaling activity has been noted in the adult lung through expression of the downstream effector Gli1, along with studies suggesting hedgehog promotes mesenchymal proliferation in vitro. However, Hh's function in normal adult tissue quiescence or its role in injury and regeneration in the lung has not been examined in in vivo models. Our preliminary data suggest that Hh signaling is active in the adult lung and is used to maintain mesenchymal quiescence during normal homeostasis as well as after injury in the proximal airways. Thus, Hh signaling plays a critical role in maintainig lung quiescence and is important in the response of the lung to injury."
"9310666","PROJECT SUMMARY Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common form of lung cancer and is the leading cause of cancer-associated deaths worldwide. Given the limited effectiveness of current treatment regimes, there is a critical need for the development of new and innovative approaches to identify actionable therapeutic targets to treat NSCLC. We identified PROTOCADHERIN 7 (PCDH7) in a transposon mutagenesis screen for genes that promote transformation of human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs). Indeed, Protocadherin family members represent an emerging class of molecules with important functions in cancer. We found that that PCDH7 is frequently overexpressed in lung cancer and that high expression of PCDH7 protein in human tumors strongly associates with poor survival of NSCLC patients. Our data demonstrate that PCDH7 overexpression potently enhances KRAS- and EGFR-induced MAPK signaling and tumorigenesis. Loss of PCDH7 sensitizes KRAS-mutant NSCLC cells to MEK inhibitors in vitro, and inhibits tumorigenesis in vivo. The overall objectives of this application are to define the oncogenic activity of PCDH7 in NSCLC using mouse models and human cells, evaluate PCDH7 as a therapeutic target, and identify the molecular mechanisms through which this cell surface protein promotes lung tumorigenesis. We propose to elucidate the role of this putative lung cancer driver gene by testing the following central hypothesis: PCDH7 promotes KRAS-and EGFR-driven lung tumorigenesis by forming a SET/PP2A inhibitory complex that potentiates MAPK- ERK signaling. Three Specific Aims will be pursued in order to test this hypothesis: In Aim 1, we will characterize the extent to which PCDH7 accelerates mutant KRAS- and EGFR-mediated tumorigenesis using a conditional PCDH7 transgenic mouse model, and inhibit PCDH7 using somatic genome editing in KrasLSL- G12D; Tp53 fl/fl mice. In Aim 2, we will elucidate the roles of SET and PP2A in PCDH7-induced MAPK signaling and tumorigenesis. Finally, in Aim 3, we will examine the extent to which PCDH7 inhibition enhances sensitivity to clinically approved inhibitors in NSCLC cells in vitro and in autochthonous mouse models. These aims will take advantage of our expertise, and that of our collaborators, to evaluate PCDH7 as a therapeutic target, and identify the mechanisms through which this cell surface protein promotes lung tumorigenesis. We anticipate that these studies will yield novel insights into the mechanisms of lung cancer pathogenesis and provide new opportunities to pursue this cell surface receptor as a therapeutic target in KRAS- and EGFR- driven lung cancers."

Fellows learn to apply psychological theories and cutting-edge research methodologies to address issues in (1) stress, depression, and psychobiology and (2) health-risk behavior, as they relate to the prevention and amelioration of diseases including major depression, PTSD, and AIDS. In so doing, they are exposed to problems related to health disparities and approaches to developing and testing interventions.  During the two years of training, fellows share a common didactic core including the Psychology and Medicine Seminar; Research Process Seminar; Mind and Biology; Responsible Conduct of Research; six statistics modules, and take additional courses as needed. They conduct independent research with the supervision of a primary mentor, submit papers for publication and presentation at national conferences, and complete a draft of a grant application.  The program benefits from its placement in a leading health science campus, with strong training and research programs in the biological, social/behavioral and clinical sciences. Other strengths of the program include: a top-rank faculty who are committed to training and model collaborative transdisciplinary work; ample opportunities for cross-fertilization with fellows and faculty from other programs; and access to key databases and to seed funds for pilot research.  The program has produced outstanding, productive young researchers who have gone on to productive careers in medical or academic centers. During our current five year cycle, we have increased research on depression, PTSD and other mental illnesses; enhanced training in psychobiological mechanisms that link stress, psychological/social processes and behavior with mental and physical disorders; increased intervention research and research on disparities and recruited our first psychiatrist. In the renewal we have reduced and reorganized faculty to create a more coherent program, appointed an Associate Director, added additional biostatisticians, established more formal ties to the Psychiatry residency research track, and made more active plans for recruiting underrepresented minorities. In our renewal cycle we plan for three new fellows a year, which will allow us to recruit both psychologists and psychiatrists."
"9233751","Project III. Understanding the architecture, regulation, and function of piRNA-producing genes Phillip D. Zamore, P.I. Project Summary In flies, mammals, and worms, PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) silence transposons and repetitive elements, protecting the germline genome from DNA damage and mutation and ensuring that genetic information passes faithfully from generation to generation. They also have other, poorly understood functions. We propose to define the gene structure, genomic architecture, and regulation of the piRNA-producing genes in mice, flies, and worms. We will then use this information to investigate why some long RNAs make piRNAs while others do not. We will also explore how full-length piRNA precursor transcripts, often tens of kilobases long, are converted into mature piRNAs just 23?35 nt long. Finally, we will test a variety of hypotheses, generated from our data, as to how piRNAs function, particularly in mammals, where most piRNAs do not correspond to transposons. To pursue these aims, we will combine genetics, high-throughput sequencing, and classical biochemistry. We believe that by investigating a common set of questions about the piRNA pathway in three model animals, the conserved and divergent features we discover will yield a deeper understanding of this ancient pathway than could be achieved by working on a single species alone. Relevance Small RNAs called ?piRNAs? protect animal sperm and egg precursor cells from damage from selfish genetic elements called transposons or ?jumping genes.? Without piRNAs, animals from worms to mammals are sterile, yet we do not understand how piRNAs are made, and for many piRNAs, what they regulate. We hope to obtain a more complete and deeper understanding of this amazing process."
"9256522","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Macromolecules have demonstrated great value as research tools, human therapeutics, and diagnostics. The size and complexity of folded macromolecules can result in potencies and specificities of action that are not easily achievable using small molecules. Features unique to folded macromolecules make them well suited for therapeutic and basic research applications. The theoretical functional diversity of human health-related antibodies, or their fragments, is large because antibodies and antibody fragments can be raised against a theoretically infinite number of disease-related targets in vivo, including targets that are typically viewed as undruggable using small molecules. However, the generation, production, and purification of antibodies and their fragments is often difficult and expensive. Methods to identify unnatural proteins that bind therapeutically relevant cellular targets in vivo are of considerable interest to the biomedical community because they may significantly increase the number of proteins with therapeutic activity, and represent an alternative strategy to antibody-based macromolecular therapeutic development. Here, we propose to exploit our recent development of split-superpositive GFP reassembly to identify unnatural proteins with affinity for ankyrin repeat domain proteins overexpressed in disease, and which frustrate small molecule-based drug discovery. In addition, we will use protein evolution and engineering to identify RNA binding proteins with high affinity and specificity for RNA hairpins critical to HIV replication. The therapeutic potential of these new protein reagents will be measured using a number of in vitro and cell-based assays. Taken together, the findings revealed in this research will potentially lead to the generation of proteins that overcome limitations to small molecule-centered drug discovery, and may point the way to new therapeutic strategies."
"9297813","PROJECT SUMMARY  The aim of this proposal is to characterize the clinical relevance of novel autoantibodies produced against neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in cystic fibrosis (CF). Lung complications are the main cause of mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF). CF lungs are characterized by chronic infiltration of neutrophils. Clinical data clearly show that released neutrophil-derived granule components and DNA are associated with lung function decline in CF. Results obtained by us and others indicate that formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) provides the major mechanism for the release of neutrophil-mediated inflammatory mediators in CF airways. Neutrophils release NETs to trap and kill extracellular microbes. However, uncontrolled NET release has been linked to several diseases such as CF. Besides having short-term damaging effects on surrounding tissues, released NET components could also serve as antigens triggering an autoimmune response in CF. Our preliminary data obtained in human CF clinical biospecimen using five independent approaches show that several autoantibodies produced against NET components are present in CF serum and sputum. This suggests that autoantibodies targeting NETs are produced in CF patients. Our long-term research goal is to characterize this novel autoimmune component of CF. The objective here, which is our logical first step in pursuit of that goal, is to establish that autoantibodies specific for NET components are present in CF and are associated with reduced lung function or other clinical symptoms. Our central hypothesis is that levels of anti-NET autoantibodies present in CF correlate with lung disease severity and impaired NET degradation of CF sera. To test our hypothesis, we will perform the following three specific aims: 1) Determine correlation of anti-NET autoantibodies with CF lung disease severity; 2) Determine whether CF patients have elevated levels of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies; and 3) Determine whether anti-NET autoantibodies lead to impaired NET degradation in CF sera. Our expected outcomes are that 1) CF lung disease severity correlates with serum levels of anti-NET antibodies and the inability of CF serum to degrade NETs; 2) anti-citrullinated antibodies characteristic for the autoimmune disease, rheumatoid arthritis, are also present in CF; 3) anti-NET autoantibodies are potentially linked to CF-related arthritis, vasculitis, kidney disease, diabetes or cutaneous manifestations. Overall, our work proposes that CF has an underappreciated autoimmune component likely induced by the chronic presence of NET-derived host molecules. Our proposed work will have a positive impact by providing essential, novel knowledge on the presence and clinical relevance of anti-NET autoantibodies in CF. It will advance our understanding of CF airway inflammation and autoimmunity in CF."
"9221471","Project Summary/Abstract: Malignant transformation of normal cells are driven by oncogenic mutations of key cellular genes where therapeutics are actively being developed to target these mutations for interventions that will improve morbidity and/or mortality. The current clinical practice to interrogate these ?actionable mutations? is by tumor biopsy followed by genotyping which is invasive and at times access restrictive, challenging, subject to sampling errors and may simply not possible. Liquid biopsy is a rapidly emerging field to access actionable mutations in tumors minimal/non-invasively in bodily fluids based on circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). This UH2/UH3 application is responsive to the PAR-15-095 to advance the translational and clinical development of a matured academic laboratory assay, the EFIRM-Liquid Biopsy (eLB) to a ?Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment? (CLIA)-certified laboratory developed test (eLB-LDT), in the UCLA Molecular Diagnostic Laboratories (MDL), a CLIA-certified/ College of American Pathologists (CAP)-accredited Laboratory. The eLB- LDT will be evaluated in a clinical context of use to interrogate actionable mutations in the EGFR gene of NSCLC patients at the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System (VA GLA). It is important to advance academic assays for cancer detection, diagnosis and treatment to regulated clinical assays that will provide novel capabilities to physicians to impact health of their patients. Our proposal is to advance a matured academic assay, EFIRM-Liquid Biopsy (eLB) that delivers the best performance technology to detect oncogenic mutations, to become a CLIA-certified laboratory developed test (LDT), the EFIRM-Liquid Biopsy laboratory developed test (eLB-LDT). eLB detects actionable EGFR mutations in NSCLC patients with 100% concordance with biopsy-based genotyping, outperforms current technologies for liquid biopsy. The clinical validation study will be conducted at the UCLA Medical Center and VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System (VA GLA) where 20% of patients with adenocarcinoma subtype of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) harbor TKI-responsive mutations in the EGFR gene. The eLB-LDT technology if validated, may replace current practice of liquid biopsy for EGFR genotyping as it has the best performance, minimal or non-invasive, rapid, inexpensive and self-contained permitting the detection of the most common EGFR gene mutations that are treatable with TKI such as Gefitinib or Erlotinib to effectively extend the progression free survival of lung cancer patients.  Two Specific Aims are in place to achieve these goals. Aim 1/UH2 is to adapt the academic EFIRM-Liquid Biopsy (eLB) technology to become a CLIA-certified assay in the UCLA Diagnostics Molecular Pathology Laboratory and to determine analytical and clinical performance. Aim 2/UH3 is to analytically and clinically validate eLB-LDT at the clinical sites (UCLA and VA GLA)."
"9259045","Abstract Corticosteroids or glucocorticoids (GCs) are widely used to treat inflammatory airway diseases such as asthma. Despite their widespread use in the clinic, the molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic actions of GCs remain incompletely understood. Glucocorticoids mediate their actions by binding to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) a nuclear receptor, which then translocates to the nucleus and regulates gene expression. Anti-inflammatory actions of GR have classically been attributed to GR binding to other transcription factors such as NF-KB and repressing their transcriptional activity while activation of gene expression by GR has been implicated in the side effects of GCs. Recent studies, however, have shown that GR can cooperate with NF-kB to activate gene expression. Indeed, our ChIP-Seq studies identified numerous genes that are regulated cooperatively by GR and NF-kB in the airway epithelium. In addition, some of these cooperatively activated genes have known anti-inflammatory actions that are glucocorticoid-independent. Based on this evidence, we hypothesize that GR and NF-kB cooperate to induce anti-inflammatory gene expression that contributes to therapeutic actions of GCs in airway epithelium. We will test our hypothesis by interrogating the mechanism of cooperation between GR and NF-kB to induce SERPINA3 and by elucidating the role of SERPINA3 in allergic airway inflammation. Our specific aims are 1) Identify and define the role of key DNA sequence elements mediating GR and NF-kB cooperation at a putative SERPINA3 enhancer and 2) Determine if SERPINA3 suppresses allergic airway inflammation in vivo. Through these aims we expect to demonstrate that GR and NFkB cooperation represents a novel pathway underpinning the therapeutic actions of GCs in inflammatory airway diseases.  "
"9324516","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The misuse of an addiction to opioid medications has become the most rapidly increasing drug problem in the US, which has consequences for pregnant mothers and their babies. The prevalence of maternal opioid drug use at the time of delivery in California is approximately one percent. The neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is a constellation of narcotic drug withdrawal symptoms that develops in 42 to 94 percent of infants born to narcotic dependent mothers. There are no preventative treatments for this severe syndrome, which can result in a prolonged hospitalization and treatment in a neonatal intensive care unit. Based upon a genetic discovery, we demonstrated that administration of a 5-HT3 antagonist (ondansetron) prevented the symptoms of narcotic drug withdrawal in experimental studies in mice and in humans. From this, we hypothesize that ondansetron administration to pregnant narcotic-using mothers just prior to delivery, followed by a 3-day period of ondansetron administration to the neonate, could reduce the incidence or severity of NAS symptoms. Ondansetron is a broadly utilized drug with a substantial safety record in pregnant women, but we do not know what effect pregnancy may have on ondansetron pharmacokinetics and it is hard to predict ondansetron pharmacokinetics at birth. Therefore, we will first perform a detailed characterization of ondansetron pharmacokinetics in pregnant mothers and in neonates. Besides providing important information about differences in drug metabolism during pregnancy and in neonates, these results will ensure that appropriate ondansetron doses are selected for treatment of the mothers and neonates in the subsequent efficacy study. In the second part of this study, we will conduct a multi-center, randomized, double blind, and placebo-controlled trial to determine whether ondansetron treatment will reduce the incidence (percentage of infants requiring narcotic drug treatment) or severity (total amount of narcotic drug required, length of hospitalization, symptom severity scores) of NAS in babies born to narcotic-using mothers. This project tests a very novel approach for preventing an important pregnancy-related complication of narcotic drug abuse. If a brief period of ondansetron administration to the mothers that use narcotic drugs, and to their babies, can prevent or ameliorate the development of narcotic drug withdrawal symptoms in neonates, this would reduce human suffering and the growing societal cost of opiate abuse."
"9340352","SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dendritic cell (DC) therapy represents a new and promising immunotherapeutic approach for treatment of advanced stage cancers, with DC vaccines already approved for use in advanced prostate cancer, and more than 30 DC-based vaccines in the clinical development pipeline for other cancers. In particular, the US market for cancer vaccines (including DC-based vaccines) is set to expand tremendously at a CAGR of 78.1% from $20 million in 2010 to $2 billion by 2018. This highlights the need to develop clinical grade technologies for collecting DC precursor cells and generating DCs for cancer vaccination. Typically, DCs are differentiated from monocytes, which are isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells using different methods including plastic adherence, counter-flow elutriation, and immunomagnetic selection or depletion of cells. Of these techniques, immunomagnetic selection of CD14+ monocytes is the most commonly employed technique in the clinic. While this technique results in a relatively pure population of monocytes as compared to the other techniques, the recovery/yield of monocytes is low. Also, the use of antibodies to purify monocytes makes it cost-prohibitive for large-scale production of monocytes. In addition, all the above mentioned techniques are unable to isolate monocytes from whole blood, and require a density-gradient step prior to isolation of monocytes, thus increasing costs, time and technical skill involved. Thus, there is an unmet need to develop a simple, rapid and efficient method capable of isolating a highly pure and quiescent population of monocytes directly from whole blood. Affinergy has identified a family of peptides that bind specifically to monocytes, while not binding to the other blood cells. When conjugated to magnetic beads, these peptides can directly isolate monocytes from whole blood, and result in high recovery and purity, without any additional processing steps. At the conclusion of Phase I, we will have established a rapid and efficient method for purifying monocytes from whole blood and demonstrated that the enriched monocytes are capable of differentiating into DCs. In Phase II, we will optimize large-scale production of peptide-conjugated beads, establish shelf-life and storage conditions and demonstrate the feasibility of our technique to purify monocytes at a larger scale."
"9248450","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to understand how oligodendrocytes, the myelinating glial cells of the central nervous system (CNS), are produced. During development, dividing neuroepithelial precursors give rise to oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Following migration to become dispersed throughout the CNS, some OPCs differentiate as myelinating oligodendrocytes but others remain in a non-myelinating state into adulthood. The mechanisms that guide formation of OPCs from proliferating neuroepithelial precursors and specify myelinating and non-myelinating fates are not well known. Using zebrafish as a model system, this project combines in vivo live cell imaging with genetic and pharmacological manipulations to test novel hypotheses formulated to identify mechanisms that regulate OPC specification. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that microRNA inhibition of apical Par polarity proteins regulates the proliferation to differentiation transition by making precursors less sensitive to Shh signaling. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that different levels of Shh signaling specify myelinating and non-myelinating OPCs. Specific Aim 3 will identify gene functions that mediate specification of myelinating and non-myelinating OPC fates in response to differential Shh signaling. Completion of these Aims will fill important gaps in our basic knowledge of neural development and reveal molecular targets that could be used to promote myelination following injury or disease."
"9235281","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Support is requested for six optometry students to participate in a three-month research training program at The Ohio State University College of Optometry. The goal of the training program is to encourage professional students to embark on a career in eye research.

The training will be conducted in the laboratories of 24 established eye and vision researchers (six per year), primarily members of the College of Optometry but with representation from the Neuroscience, Psychology, Biomedical Engineering, and Ophthalmology. The mentors' specific areas of research include, but are certainly not limited to refractive error, ocular embryonic development, color perception, pediatrics, cataractogenesis, vision rehabilitation, retinal detachments, adaptive optics, and corneoscleral biomechanics. Students will gain research experience and knowledge in order to stimulate knowledge of and interest in vision research. To that end, of the 116 College of Optometry graduates who previously participated in the T35 program, 59 (51%) received Master's degrees, three received PhD degrees, five (4%) are currently enrolled in PhD programs, and four received K08 or K23 awards from the National Eye Institute. These students have also been co-authors on 195 scientific abstracts and 54 peer-reviewed publications.  Continued support of the OSU College of Optometry T35 program will therefore contribute to the scientific literature and engage future independent clinician scientists who perform independent research on vision- related topics."
"9261862","Project Summary Acute Lung injury especially acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have been identified as life threatening conditions associated with significant mortality rate. Despite advances in the past decades in the knowledge on lung diseases, ARDS continues to claim the lives of more than 40% of its victims. The increase in health care associated costs has a major economic impact, while major clinical efforts to manage this disease are insufficient due to an uncomplete understanding of the mechanisms that control the pathology manifestations. Blood platelets, neutrophils and endothelial cells have been identified as the key components in the progression of ALI/ARDS. Moreover, our understanding of platelets function has shifted over the past years from a simple hemostatic tool to dynamic modulators of the immune response. The current paradigm of platelets intents to uncover the molecular mechanisms that make these cells major orchestrators of inflammation. Previous reports have demonstrated that the absence of platelets leads to increase endothelial damage, aberrant neutrophil function and hemorrhage during inflammation. Moreover, these effects have been shown to be controlled by the release of platelet granules during activation. To date, the identity of the platelet granule molecule or molecules involved in this remains to be elucidated representing gab in our knowledge. Accordingly, this study seeks to identify key platelet components that modulate systemic response during inflammation through the modulation of neutrophil-endothelial cell crosstalk and mechanisms involved. To dissect that question we will evaluate a platelet granule product known as TLT-1 in the mediation of the signaling mechanisms that modulates neutrophil -endothelial cell cross-talk during inflammation. The basis for the selection of TLT-1 as a potential target emerges from previous studies that demonstrated that TLT-1 knockout mice exhibited increased edema and hemorrhage together with a marked dysfunction of neutrophils during inflammation elicited by the Schwartzman reaction derived vasculitis. Moreover, we have evaluated TLT-1 functions in other models of inflammation including a mouse model of ALI using intranasal inoculation of LPS. Our preliminary data shows that TLT-1 prevents inflammatory associated hemorrhage while facilitate neutrophils transmigration in lung leading to decrease endothelial damage. Therefore, based on these previous observations we hypothesize that TLT-1 mediates the signaling mechanisms that regulate neutrophil capacity to transmigrate to the inflammatory site and modulate neutrophil- endothelial cell interactions during inflammation and therefore controlling the immune response. We developed two specific aims to answer that question. The aims are as follows: (i) Define a role for TLT-1 in platelet-neutrophill-endothelial cell interactions during inflammation and (ii) Elucidate the therapeutic effects of TLT-1 on ALI/ARDS. This two aims will help to fulfill our current understanding of platelet biological functions in inflammation. The answers obtained through the realization of this research work will empower our knowledge to be able to develop new alternative treatments directed to control systemic response to inflammation."

"9138029","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite widespread recognition of the gendered nature of HIV risk, globally, women are underrepresented in HIV and drug treatment programs. Women are less likely than men to access needle/syringe exchange programs and have less access to and use of opioid substitution therapy. Women who use drugs encounter gender-related barriers to receiving appropriate and necessary HIV and drug use treatment and care, including stigma and lack of appropriate services. Moreover, women who use drugs have HIV-related risks that differ from men's risks. Women encounter HIV risks related to drug use, sex, and a constellation of personal, economic, and social factors. Female drug users also often experience high levels of poverty, financial dependence, and violence and abuse, which limit their ability to negotiate relationships and safer sex practices.  The World Health Organization and UNAIDS, among others, have recognized the need for gender-specific prevention, treatment, and care programs and services; and a broad range of services for drug users that are accessible and convenient. In order to build comprehensive HIV prevention strategies that address the multiple contributors to women's HIV vulnerability, it is first necessary to understand  existing systems of care, gaps in services, and the ways in which those at risk for HIV access and interact with service systems. This study will conduct a comprehensive assessment of HIV and drug use-related services for women in Ukraine to guide the development of a gender-informed, integrated service strategy that addresses the unique HIV-related risks and service needs of women who use drugs. Ukraine has one of the most severe HIV epidemics in Eastern Europe, and together with Russia accounts for almost 90 percent of Eastern Europe and Central Asia's newly reported HIV diagnoses. Women in Ukraine represent up to 40% of all HIV cases, but HIV prevention and drug use treatment programs that holistically address women's unique HIV-related needs are rare.  In this 2-year project, we will conduct in-depth, qualitative interviews with 60 female drug users and 60 treatment and service providers in 2 Ukrainian cities. Interviews with women who use drugs will explore sources of support, including utilization of social safety net programs; and experiences seeking help and substance abuse treatment from governmental and nongovernmental entities. Interviews with service providers will ask about their experiences working with women who use drugs, assess their degree of gender- responsiveness, and explore how responsive they are to gender-specific contributors to women's HIV vulnerability. We will create a resource map to identify existing services and service gaps, and how service providers in a given area relate to one another (e.g., collaborative partnerships, referral systems, or antagonistic relationships). This information will  be used to develop an integrated service strategy for women who use drugs that reflects the health and social service context in Ukraine. In a future, R01 study, this woman-tailored set of services and programs will be compared to existing standard packages of services."
"9240584","Project Summary/Abstract  Human enteric pathogens are responsible for millions of deaths worldwide each year, and unfortunately, the current  human cell culture models that exist are poorly suited to study many diseases. Therefore, the overarching goal of  this U19 proposal is to implement the use of Human Intestinal Organoids (HIOs) as a novel model system to study  enteric pathogens. HIOs are complex, multicellular 3-dimensional intestinal tissues generated from human pluripo-  tent stem cells. In order to implement HIOs as a novel model for the investigation of enteric pathogenesis, we will  investigate the use of this model to study HIO-pathogen interactions (Project 1), HIO-immune interactions (Project  2), and finally, we will engineer scalable fluidics systems that will also allow us to create luminal flow, take real-time  physiological measurements and maintain HIOs in long-term culture (Project 3). Central to all 3 projects are the use  of HIOs, and essential for Project 2 and Project 3 are generating genetically modified HIOs, and co-culture of im-  mune cells with HIOs. While growth, differentiation and manipulation of hPSCs to generate HIOs is a well-  characterized and robust process, centralization of these procedures will allow the most efficient use of project re-  sources and will ensure uniform and standardized starting material for all projects. Therefore, the Stem Cell Differ-  entiation Core (SCDC) will support all three U19 projects by carrying out the following four essential functions:  1) Provide centralized HIO production and quality control; 2) Provide quality controlled reagents, training and  consultation required to differentiate hPSCs and grow HIOs; 3) Produce isogenically matched NOD2 and  ATG16L1 genetically modified hPSC lines. 4) Differentiate macrophages, dendritic cells and neutrophils cells  from hPSCs."
"9313499","Project Summary Lilliam Ambroggio, PhD, MPH is an infectious diseases epidemiologist whose overarching career goal is to improve outcomes for children with common, serious infections by developing methods to improve diagnostic accuracy and implementing these methods into clinical practice. The research she proposes entitled Metabolomic Evaluation in the Etiology of Pneumonia (MEEP) combines advanced statistical techniques with 1H-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) metabolomics methodology to identify metabolites, which will facilitate etiologic diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children. Such pathogen identification will result in timely and accurate diagnosis that will permit targeted and effective management of this disease. Candidate: Dr. Ambroggio is an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics with a joint appointment in the Divisions of Hospital Medicine and Biostatistics and Epidemiology at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC). She completed a Master's in Public Health and a Ph.D. in Epidemiology at Drexel University prior to beginning a post-doctoral fellowship at CCHMC. Her previous work in the clinical management of CAP focusing on antibiotic prescribing and diagnostic tools to detect pneumonia in combination with her previous training in molecular and cellular biology have prepared her to conduct the proposed research. The proposed career development plan will build upon her previous training with four training goals to enhance her trajectory toward becoming an independent investigator: 1) Experiential and didactic learning in study design and execution of quantitative 1H-NMR metabolomics; 2) Acquire and apply advanced statistical analyses; 3) Interpret metabolomics data and its biological context and 4) Develop leadership and professional skills to execute multicenter studies. Dr. Ambroggio proposes training activities that include didactic and experiential learning to enable her to gain the necessary skills for metabolomic research. Mentors/Environment: Dr. Ambroggio and her primary mentor, Samir S. Shah, MD, MSCE, have assembled a strong team of co-mentors and advisors to guide Dr. Ambroggio through the proposed training and research activities. The proposed career development plan utilizes the intellectual and metabolomics resources available through the University of Cincinnati and CCHMC, as well as resources available at the University of Michigan through Dr. Ambroggio's external mentor, Kathleen Stringer, PharmD. In addition Dr. Ambroggio will attend national seminars and workshops when optimal training is not available locally. As an institution CCHMC is committed to supporting junior faculty members through internal grants, administrative support and structured opportunities for faculty networking and education. Dr. Ambroggio will be obtaining biological specimens for this proposal from a fully operational, externally-funded prospective cohort study, CARPE DIEM. Both the ED and inpatient services at CCHMC provide an established research infrastructure and a large ambulatory and hospitalized patient population to conduct the proposed research. In addition all mentors have agreed to participate on Dr. Ambroggio's scholarly oversight committee which has been meeting quarterly since 2013. Research: There is currently no accurate method to identify the etiology of CAP in children. This results in overtreatment with antibiotics or delays in appropriate treatment in children who are at risk for CAP-related morbidity. This proposal is the first step in developing a specific, fast and noninvasive approach for pathogen identification in children diagnosed with CAP. Aim 1 characterizes the sources (e.g. age and sex) of variation that exist in a healthy child's metabolome over three points. Aim 2 compares metabolite profiles from children who had a positive PCR test from either the nasopharynx or the blood for a virus, bacterial infection such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, or Streptococcus pneumoniae with children who have no known infections. The purpose of this aim is to identify unique metabolite profiles using quantitative 1H-NMR for each pathogen identified. Aim 3 will use urine samples from patients with CAP and compare them with samples from healthy contorls over three time points to determine the impact of antibiotic treatment on metabolite profiles. The completion of these aims will generate a metabolite profile database of common pathogens associated with childhood CAP and drive a systems biology approach to CAP diagnosis and treatment. Summary: The innovation of the proposed research is the integration of robust clinical phenotype data from an ambulatory population with quantitative NMR metabolomics using novel statistical methods to address the clinically challenging problem of pediatric CAP diagnostics. The strong collaborations between the Divisions of Hospital Medicine, Biostatistics and Epidemiology, and Emergency Medicine at CCHMC and with the metabolomics core at the University of Michigan ensure the success of the proposed research. This award will provide Dr. Ambroggio with the training and research needed to be successful in a future, multi-center study to validate the metabolite profiles of pathogens causing CAP in children. Furthermore, this career development award will facilitate Dr. Ambroggio's development into a nationally-recognized independent investigator and leader conducting research that improves diagnostic tools for children with infectious diseases, specifically CAP."
"9258074","Project Summary/Abstract The mechanisms for induction of autoimmunity remain enigmatic, in part due to the unconfirmed activity of many autoimmune-associated noncoding common genetic variants. To dissect the specific mechanisms of how all common and disease-associated noncoding variation modulates gene expression, I propose to employ scalable assays in three cell types that will assess 2708 noncoding common variants for gene-modulatory function in an important autoimmune-associated locus containing the negative regulatory gene TNFAIP3/A20. One assay will test ~2700 variants for their effects on reporter expression pre- and post-stimulation. A second assay will evaluate ~43,000 systematic locus-wide deletions in the genome to determine regulatory regions (and potentially active variants within) in cell types. I will then map the active disease-associated variants from these assays to the open chromatin of autoimmune patient cell types to create a ranked list of those that putatively operate in disease. I will then determine the mechanism of action for these active, open chromatin localized variants through genetically engineering risk and non-risk alleles using CRISPR-Cas9 homology directed repair and performing biochemical assays. This method is scalable to study many loci in future work, which will contribute to our knowledge of disease gene networks, accurate animal disease models, and more efficacious therapeutics. "
"9390135","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although Drosophila melanogaster is a model system for the molecular genetics of innate immunity, virtually nothing is known about the life history and virulence strategies of its natural parasites. Parasitic wasps can infect Drosophila larvae at frequencies greater than 50% in natural populations, and are highly amenable to laboratory and field study. The Schlenke lab has developed a collection of 17 live wasp parasite strains of Drosophila, and robust protocols for extracting and manipulating the venom cocktails they use to thwart the host cellular encapsulation response mounted against their eggs. In this application, Schlenke proposes to use a joint transcriptomic and proteomic approach to identify the venom gland contents of 10 related wasp species that are highly successful infectors of D. melanogaster. He will then assay the effects of whole venom from each wasp species using two types of assays: First, he will assay the effects of venom on the structure and function of D. melanogaster hemocytes ex vivo. Second, he will assay encapsulation defects in vivo by injecting oil droplets into flies, which are readily melanotically encapsulated, mixed with venom fractions. For any immune suppressive effects that whole venom has, Schlenke will then identify venom fractions and individual venom proteins responsible for these characterized venom effects. Finally, Schlenke will use population genetic and molecular evolution approaches to uncover how venoms maintain virulence function in their co-evolutionary arms race with host immune systems. In sum, Schlenke hopes to develop the Drosophila-wasp system as a model for the study of eukaryotic host-pathogen interactions and for the evolution of parasite life histories."
"9270076","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human evolution has been accompanied by a diversification of astrocytic phenotype and function, that has contributed to species-specific aspects of both human brain function and disease. As such, the development of human astrocytic complexity has paralleled the appearance in evolution of psychiatric disorders unique to humans - the schizophrenias in particular. Yet despite this correlative suggestion that astrocytic pathology might contribute to the disordered thought of schizophrenia, the role of astroglial pathology in its pathogenesis has been difficult to study, in part because of the lack o animal models of human glial pathophysiology. We propose to overcome this limitation, using a new model of human glial-chimeric mouse brains that we have developed, paired with our newly-developed protocols for efficiently and reliably generating astrocytes from patient-derived human induced pluripotential cells (hiPSCs). Using mice neonatally engrafted with glial progenitor cells (GPCs) derived from hiPSCs generated from schizophrenic patients, we will assess the specific contributions of schizophrenic patient-derived astrocytes to disease pathogenesis. In these human glial chimeric mouse brains, the vast majority of resident glia are replaced by human GPC-derived astrocytes and their progenitors, allowing human glial physiology, gene expression, and effects on neural function to be assessed in live adult mice. By pairing this chimerization approach with protocols that we have developed for both generating and purifying GPCs and astrocytes from hiPSCs, and using hiPSC lines produced from patients with juvenile-onset schizophrenia, we will produce mice whose resident glia are largely derived from patients with schizophrenia. In Aim 1, we will assess the relative effects of these schizophrenia-associated astrocytes upon glial syncytial transmission within the cortices of the chimeric mice. In Aim 2, we will next assess the synaptic plasticity of the chimeric mice, as well as the effects of schizophrenia-derived glial chimerization upon their behavioral phenotype and responses to pharmacological stressors. In Aim 3, we will sort engrafted astroglia from the brains into which they have integrated, so as to assess the gene expression patterns of schizophrenic iPSC-derived astrocytes, relative to those of normal hiPSC-derived glia. By means of this multimodal approach, we hope to define the disease-specific effects, gene expression patterns, and paracrine toxicities of schizophrenic hiPSC-derived astrocytes relative to normal hiPSC-derived glia. These diverse lines of investigation should provide us great insight into the species- and cell type-specific roles of human astrocytes in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. At the same time, by providing a new human glial chimeric model system, new cellular reagents in the form of schizophrenic patient-derived astrocytes, and new gene expression databases covering schizophrenic hiPSC-derived astrocytes, this project should allow us to make available to the field a broad and exciting new set of tools, capabilities and databases. Together, these should greatly accelerate our understanding of human glial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia."

The K24 award will protect time that would otherwise be diverted to clinical and administrative responsibilities to allow me to continue to provide intensive mentorship to junior investigators and attract researchers to POAR. My long term career objectives are: 1) To improve outcomes for individuals with AUD by developing, implementing, and evaluating novel treatment and recovery support service interventions; 2) To improve our knowledge about which types of treatment and recovery support combinations are needed for which patients during which recovery phases; 3) To understand systems and policy factors that may impede or facilitate the formation, implementation, and maintenance of effective recovery strategies; 4) To provide mentored research opportunities for early career investigators in POAR. The specific aims to be accomplished during the period of the award are to 1) Develop specific content expertise in treatment and recovery policy, and the design, implementation, and evaluation of treatment and recovery support service combinations; 2) Protect time for substantive mentoring of junior investigators in POAR, which will often take place within the context of funded research, such that more intensive mentorship will increase quality and output from ongoing POAR; and 3) Continue and extend involvement in POAR. The K24 will help me extend my POAR by protecting time that will facilitate work with mentees on funded projects, ancillary studies, secondary analyses, and papers and grants that will add value to ongoing POAR. I will devote 30% time to mentoring, 20% time to training, and 45% time to funded POAR."
"9207728","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clostridium difficile is a leading cause of hospital-acquired illness in developed countries. Treating C. difficile infection (CDI) is complicated by antibiotic resistance, recurrence (RCDI), and hypervirulence of emerging strains that produce a highly toxic variant of TcdB. TcdB is a major C. difficile virulence factor that contributes to gastrointestinal damage, inflammation, and systemic damage. In these studies experiments will characterize the differences between the historical and milder form of TcdB (TcdB1) and the hypertoxic TcdB2. Published and preliminary data from our group shows that TcdB2 has a broader tropism and is more cytotoxic than TcdB1. In addition, antibodies to TcdB1 do not cross-neutralize TcdB2, suggesting that current vaccines and therapeutic antibodies targeting TcdB may not provide broad protection against multiple strains of C. difficile. The study will examine molecular differences between TcdB1 and TcdB2 to determine how these impact cellular intoxication, antigenicity, and influence RCDI. Aim 1 will characterize the differences in dual-receptor interactions between TcdB1 and TcdB2, assess how this impacts endocytosis, and identify key residues that influence these events. Aim 2 will explore a mechanism through which TcdB2 cloaks neutralizing epitopes which are otherwise exposed in TcdB1. Experiments in aim 3 of this project will determine how the differences in TcdB1 and TcdB2 predispose patients to RCDI. The results from this project will provide the first insights into the differentil effects of TcdB1 and TcdB2 and the impact of TcdB2's heightened toxicity and altered antigenicity on the emergence of hypervirulent strains of C. difficile."
"9287425","PROJECT SUMMARY  Autoimmune diseases feature a dysfunction of the immune system in which the body attacks its own tissues. By NIH estimations, autoimmune diseases affect 7.5% of the U.S. population, and are among the leading causes of death and disability. A striking feature of many autoimmune diseases is their increased prevalence in females, and overall it is estimated that 78% of individuals affected are women. Understanding the cause of female-biased susceptibility to autoimmune diseases is fundamental to the development of preventative measures in high-risk populations, and may lead to novel therapeutic approaches for individuals with established disease.  Through genome-wide transcriptomic analyses we have identified a female-biased molecular signature linked to extensive sex-dependent, co-expression networks and associated with autoimmune disease susceptibility. This signature was independent of biological age and sex-hormone regulation, and regulated by the transcription factor VGLL3, which had a prominent female biased expression. On a genome-wide level, VGLL3 target genes were strongly associated with multiple autoimmune diseases including lupus and scleroderma, and had a prominent transcriptomic overlap with immune processes including cutaneous lupus, suggesting that VGLL3 is tightly integrated with inflammatory responses in autoimmunity, and an upstream regulator of autoimmune processes. The central hypothesis of our proposal, based on these findings, is that VGLL3 is an epigenetically regulated transcription factor that has critical roles in promoting autoimmune specific inflammatory responses. This proposal has the potential to significantly advance the field of autoimmune research by increasing our understanding of a novel sex hormone-independent inflammatory pathway in gender biased autoimmunity, identify upstream regulators of this pathway, and determine the mechanisms by which VGLL3 mediates autoimmune responses. SLE will be used as the model disease for study given the strong female bias in lupus and easy access to patient samples through our clinics and co-investigators. With the successful conclusion of the work proposed, we will have taken major strides towards understanding the involvement of VGLL3 in promoting autoimmune responses and disease activity in SLE. In addition, we will provide a solid foundation towards development of novel preventive and therapeutic measures that may have major implications against a wide range of autoimmune diseases."
"9233153","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Riboswitches are genetic control elements located within the 5' untranslated regions of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that undergo metabolite-dependent structural rearrangements to regulate mRNA transcription, splicing, translation, or stability in response to the presence and concentration of specific metabolites. The ubiquity of riboswitch-mediated transcriptional control in bacteria and the specificity with which riboswitches control bacterial gene expression are fueling efforts to develop next-generation antibiotics that target bacterial riboswitches. In addition, riboswitches are quickly becoming powerful tools in the field of synthetic biology, where they can be engineered to artificially control gene expression. Fully exploiting riboswitches for these applications, however, requires a detailed understanding of the mechanism of riboswitch-mediated transcriptional control. Although single-molecule (sm) biophysical methods, including sm fluorescence microscopy and sm force microscopy, have established themselves as powerful tools for studying metabolite- dependent structural rearrangements of riboswitches and transcription by RNA polymerases (RNAPs), the mechanistic information available from these sm methods remains limited by technical obstacles such as: (i) difficulties in fluorophore labeling of biomolecules; (ii) the application of invasive artificial forces; (iii) limited time resolution; and (iv) limited total observation time.  The higly multi-disciplinary effort described here will expand upon recent development of a carbon nanotube-based sm field effect transistor (smFET) as a new, label-free, non-invasive, high-time-resolution, extended-observation-time, sm method for in vitro studies of biomolecular binding kinetics and structural dynamics. This smFET-based experimental system will be further developed to overcome many of the limitations of established sm methods, enabling the Bacillus subtilis pbuE adenine-responsive riboswitch and the corresponding B. subtilis RNAP to be used as a model system for studying the mechanisms of metabolite- dependent riboswitch structural rearrangement (Aim 1), transcription (Aim 2), and real-time riboswitch- mediated transcriptional control (Aim 3) at unprecedented time resolutions and throughputs. These studies will enable characterization of some of the most poorly defined aspects of the mechanism of riboswitch-mediated transcriptional regulation and will provide the tools and knowledge necessary to drive the development of new antibiotic drugs that target bacterial riboswitches and the design of new riboswitches that can be used to regulate synthetic gene networks."
"9265078","The Pilot and Feasibility grant program of the Yale DRC is managed through the Pilot and Feasibility Core.  The functions of the Core are to solicit applications from investigators in the Yale School of Medicine and throughout Yale University, to carry out peer review of the applications, and to select meritorious projects for support. Grants are awarded for up to 2 years depending on progress that is made in the first year of funding and plans for the 2rd year. The Core is directed by Kevan Herold, MD who works with an oversight committee that makes final funding selections of grants for support. In the past funding cycle, the Program  benefited from additional support available through the CTSA/ARRA funds as well as collaborative support of translational studies with the Yale Clinical Translational Science Award (CTSA). Since the inception of the Yale DRC in 1993, interest and applications to the program has increased - in the past funding cycle, 88 applications were received and 28 were supported. While the majority of applications are received from  established investigators, there is a bias towards funding new investigators, many of whom have used the P+F award to obtain preliminary data to apply for external grant support. From the past funding cycle, 11 new external grants were obtained generating over $7M in new research revenue. Studies supported by the P+F program have resulted in more than 40 peer-reviewed publications during the last two funding cycles.  The P+F program has also been a mechanism for initiation of new collaborations often between basic and translational scientists. Examples of these collaborations include studies of innate immune pathways that are associated with hepatic insulin resistance and cellular mechanisms of glucose metabolism in adipocytes. In summary the P+F core plays a vital role in attracting new investigators to the diabetes field and recruiting  established investigators who are new to diabetes or are developing a new area of diabetes-related research. By effectively utilizing additional sources of revenue, the Core has been able to maintain a high level of funding which has resulted in a high level of productivity."
"9276122","The derivation of functional cardiomyocytes from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) fifteen years ago, as well as the discovery of iPSCs, has opened doors to the engineering of human cardiac tissue surrogates for use in drug discovery, disease modeling, and regenerative medicine. Still, translating human iPSC technology to clinical therapy for heart disease has been slow due to a number of challenges including immature and heterogeneous cardiomyocyte phenotype, their low expansion capacity, high metabolic demand and low viability after implantation, potential for tumor and arrhythmia induction, and high costs. To address these limitations, we propose to explore a novel strategy for cell- and gene-based cardiac repair that does not rely on the use of stem cells. Instead, we will develop methods for engineering of terminally differentiated human fibroblasts into cells capable of action potential conduction. These cells will be generated rapidly, at low cost, have stable, homogeneous, and customizable electrical phenotype, be readily expandable in vitro and available off-the-shelf, and be able to electrically couple with cardiomyocytes and significantly improve electrical and contractile function of the infarcted heart. Specifically, in Aim 1 we propose to utilize prokaryotic ion channels to engineer human fibroblasts into a readily expandable and homogeneous source of electrically excitable cells that autonomously fire and conduct action potentials. In Aim 2, we will utilize well-controlled in vitro co-culture systems to explore how engineered fibroblasts with specific electrophysiological properties affect electrical and mechanical function of native cardiomyocytes. In Aim 3, we propose to directly compare actively conducting fibroblasts and PSC-derived cardiomyocytes for their antiarrhythmic action and ability to improve contractile and hemodynamic function of infarcted rat hearts. In addition, we will utilize computer simulations to facilitate genetic engineering of actively conducting fibroblasts and enhance mechanistic understanding of their functional interactions with native cardiomyocytes in vitro and in vivo. We expect that successful completion of this project will enable future applications of engineered fibroblasts in cell-based therapies for myocardial infarction and arrhythmias."
"9263701","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, affecting over 2 million individuals 45 years of age or older in the US. The personal, social, and medical burden of glaucoma within the VHA remains an extraordinarily significant concern. Despite its overwhelming prevalence and socioeconomic impact, the treatment of Veterans with POAG is currently restricted to non-specific interventions that lower elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). For many glaucomatous Veterans, pharmacological management of IOP remains clinically refractive. These Veterans often require more extensive interventions, including invasive surgical manipulation. The development of targeted therapeutic strategies directed at the cause of elevated IOP is critical for the management of our glaucomatous Veterans. In healthy eyes, IOP is maintained through balanced production and outflow of aqueous humor (AH). Increased resistance to AH outflow through the trabecular meshwork (TM) is considered to be a major contributor of aberrant elevation of IOP in Veterans with POAG. The mechanism by which this occurs remains poorly defined, but most likely involves a combination of enhanced TM cell contractility and altered ECM deposition. Independent studies have shown that TGF-ß2, a cytokine that facilitates Rho GTPase-mediated ECM deposition and actin stress fiber organization in TM cells, is markedly elevated in the AH of POAG patients. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) a potent vasoconstrictor, is also increased in the AH from POAG patients. The association between TGF-ß2, ET-1, and Rho GTPase signaling with POAG, however, remains unclear. Peer-reviewed and published studies from our laboratory demonstrate a striking association between TGF-ß2 and ET-1 production within human TM cells. Our preliminary findings included in this application further demonstrate for the first time that by selectively targeting and disrupting Rho GTPase signaling, we can successfully prevent harmful increases in TGF-ß2 and ET-1 expression in human TM cells. These findings strongly suggest that aberrant Rho GTPase signaling elevates IOP, in part, by facilitating pathologic increases in TGF-ß2 and ET-1 in the anterior segment of POAG Veterans. Novel translational studies are critically needed to develop therapeutic and rehabilitative strategies for the advanced care of our Veterans debilitated by glaucoma. siRNA technology is an exciting and promising new field that has realistic therapeutic/rehabilitative potential for the management of ocular disorders, including glaucoma. In this two-year SPiRE study, we will determine whether siRNA-mediated Rho GTPase knockdown therapeutically lowers experimentally-elevated IOP. Hypothesis: Therapeutically administered siRNA selectively targeting monomeric Rho GTPases will markedly lower pathologically elevated intraocular pressure by disrupting TGF-ß2 and ET-1 expression and signaling. Specific Aim 1 will determine whether administration of siRNAs targeting key monomeric Rho GTPases protects against experimentally elevated changes in outflow resistance as quantified by human and porcine anterior segment perfusion analyses. Specific Aim 2 will determine whether administration of siRNAs targeting key monomeric Rho GTPases attenuates expression of proET-1, ETA, ETB, TGF-ß2 or TGFßRI in human and porcine globes with experimentally elevated outflow resistance as quantified by immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy. The immediate goal of this study is to establish siRNA-mediated Rho GTPase knockdown as a novel strategy by which to manage elevated IOP associated with POAG. Successful completion of this study will serve as a critical first step toward developing this technology for the management of Veterans with POAG."
"9233744","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The sole purpose of the germline is to produce gametes-the vehicles of heritable genetic and epigenetic information. In animals, the development and maintenance of a functional germline and gametes requires the activity of PIWI proteins, germline- expressed Argonaut family members that interact with small RNAs known as piRNAs. The best known function for the piRNA pathway is to protect the genome from invading transposable elements, yet most animals encode multiple PIWI genes that interact with distinct classes of piRNAs, suggesting that piRNA pathways have divergent functions even within an organism. Indeed, piRNAs that derive from unique sequences in the genome are abundantly expressed during pachytene in the mouse testis, but whether they promote or simply correlate with sperm development is unclear. These observations raise many important and unresolved questions that are essential to understanding how piRNA pathways promote germline immortality. We propose studies in three model organisms-worms, flies, and mice-to identify the conserved mechanisms and functions of piRNA pathways in animals."
"9230429","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek to identify new regulators of red blood cell production (erythropoiesis) by taking advantage of the robust statistical findings from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). While GWAS have identified thousands of loci across the human genome that are associated with various diseases or traits, the biological underpinnings for the vast majority of these loci remain unclear. This has given rise to skepticism about the value of GWAS for gaining a deeper understanding of clinical medicine or functional biology. We have previously utilized the results of erythroid trait GWAS to identify important regulators of erythropoiesis and globin gene regulation. This included work uncovering the first specific regulator of the fetal-to-adult hemoglobin switch, BCL11A, and work that revealed a critical role for cyclin D3 in terminal erythropoiesis. In this project proposal, we aim to extend these findings to over 50 loci associated with erythroid traits in humans in an attempt to uncover new regulators of erythropoiesis. We initially plan to map and identify all candidate genes in the loci revealed from erythroid trait GWAS. This will be accomplished by taking advantage of resources that identify common human variation and allow us to infer linkage disequilibrium patterns. We then plan to functionally screen all candidate genes in these regions using a loss-of-function pooled short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen in primary human erythroid cells. This will allow us to identify candidate regulators of erythropoiesis from these regions. We then plan to perform in-depth analysis of these candidate regulators in human cells and in mouse models to define the exact role of these candidates in erythropoiesis. This will be accomplished through the use of both loss and gain-of-function perturbation of these candidate genes. Finally, we aim to examine whether the regulators of erythropoiesis identified through our studies can be manipulated to improve the current methods of ex vivo red blood cell production, which is a problem of immediate clinical relevance. Limitations in the blood supply of certain antigen-containing red blood cells pose a considerable clinical problem. Such ex vivo-derived red cells could serve as an alternative to standard transfusions in cases where such problems arise. This project has the potential to substantially advance two distinct areas of biomedical research: (1) The findings from these studies will identify new regulators of erythropoiesis that could be involved in, modifiers of, or help identify therapeutic avenues to treat various forms of anemia. Our prior work on BCL11A illustrates how studying a fundamental biological problem (fetal hemoglobin regulation) can result in promising therapeutic insight. (2) The functional approaches undertaken in this project could provide resources and serve as a paradigm for future research aimed at identifying the biological underpinnings of other GWAS."
"9231478","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Kirsten Kangelaris, a hospitalist at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Kangelaris is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient-oriented clinical research in acute lung injury (ALI), with a focus on understanding biologic and genetic factors that impact susceptibility to and prognosis in acute lung injury among African-American patients. This K23 award will provide Dr. Kangelaris with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert patient-oriented clinical and translational researcher in acute lung injury; (2) to elucidate genetic and biologic mechanisms of acute lung injury combining innovative approaches including genetics, protein markers and functional genomics; (3) to implement advanced biostatistical techniques in clinical studies, including advanced regression and bioinformatics; and (4) to develop an independent clinical research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Kangelaris has assembled a multidisciplinary team comprised of a primary mentor, Dr. Michael Matthay, who has extensive experience in translational, pathogenesis-oriented ALI research, and in mentoring junior faculty to independent investigators, and two co-mentors: Dr. Elad Ziv, an expert in genetic mapping in admixed populations, and Dr. Bradley Aouizerat, a leader in genomics and molecular epidemiology. Additionally, Dr. Kangelaris will benefit from the expertise of several scientific advisors. Acute lung injury (ALI) is a common cause of acute respiratory failure in hospitalized patients, and African Americans suffer the highest ALI incidence and mortality rates. Dr. Kangelaris' research plan builds on her preliminary data to examine chemokine-dependent pathways of ALI pathogenesis in African-American patients. She will study the role of a functional polymorphism in the Duffy antigen/receptor for chemokines gene (Darc -46C/C, rs2814778), prevalent in individuals of African descent, that has been associated with worse ALI outcomes in her preliminary work, possibly via an increase in circulating interleukin (IL)-8. Dr. Kangelaris will test the extent to which this so-called Dufy null genotype is associated with susceptibility to acute lung injury (Aim 1), determine whether the Duffy null genotype is associated with differences in Duffy- binding chemokine levels (e.g., IL-8) and biomarkers of injury among patients with acute lung injury (Aim 2), and to use whole blood gene expression to identify chemokine-related pathways of acute lung injury pathogenesis in African-American patients (Aim 3). This research plan makes use of the existing infrastructure of Dr. Carolyn Calfee's Early Assessment of Renal and Lung Injury (EARLI) cohort at UCSF and Dr. Lorraine Ware's Validation of biomarkers in Acute Lung Injury Diagnosis (VALID) cohort at Vanderbilt University. This research will form the basis for an R01-level application to study the association between chemokine-related genomic and protein markers and acute lung injury susceptibility and outcomes in African-American patients."
"9222063","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The microtubule-associated protein Tau is a key component of the intracellular inclusions that are found in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and a variety of other neurodegenerative diseases, together referred to as Tauopathies. However, the mechanisms of pathology in these diseases are still unclear. A long standing debate is whether disease-associated changes in Tau are pathogenic because they induce a loss of its normal function, induce a novel toxic gain-of function, or a combination of both. In addition, the differet disease- associated mutations and modifications of Tau may have different pathogenic mechanisms. Whereas gain-of functions have been investigated in several models, loss of functions have been less well studied and most of the studies addressing such functions have been done in vitro. Furthermore, the majority of gain-of function studies are based on expression system that cause overexpression or ectopic expression, which can cause phenotypes even with normal wild type Tau. To address the hypothesis that the mechanism of pathogenesis are due to combinations of loss-of and gain-of functions and that the degree of their contributions may vary in different Tauopathies, it is proposed to create novel Drosophila models that expressing human Tau instead of fly Tau. Due to their short generation time, the unique genetic means available in this model, and the small size of their brain which allows time lapse imaging of intact brains (to measure microtubule-associated axonal transport), Drosophila provides a uniquely suitable model to analyze these lines in a relatively short time frame. These studies will also take advantage of the recent characterization of flies lacking endogenous fly Tau (dTau), which show age-related neurodegeneration and various microtubules defects. These defined phenotypes will therefore allow an analysis to what degree a mutant Tau has lost its normal function. Creating flies carrying a disease-associated and a wild type form (or a copy of dTau) can be used to study gain-of function effects and the expression by the endogenous fly Tau promoter should prevent overexpression phenotypes. The results obtained in this exploratory proposal can then provide the basis to identify genetic and pharmacological means that interfere with the pathology or its consequences and they can be used to address specific pathogenic mechanisms in the mouse model. Public Heath Relevance: A roadblock in understanding and developing treatment strategies for Tauopathies is that the mechanisms of pathology are still unclear. Identifying loss-of functions versus gain-of functions of disease-associated Tau is critical to develop such treatment strategies. Whereas Tauopathies that are mainly caused by Tau gain-of functions could be ameliorated by reducing Tau, loss-of function phenotypes would be aggravated by such strategies. Similarly, treatment strategies based on stabilizing microtubules would be a promising approach in cases where a mutation causes a loss of the microtubule function but not in cases where they lead to a novel, microtubule independent, gain-of function."
"9232998","Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) has become a major emerging cause of morbidity and mortality among hospitalized patients since the epidemics of hypervirulent and antibiotic-resistant strains began in the early 2000s. It is therefore important to develop new preventions/treatments to counteract the rapid increase in the incidence of CDI. While standard treatments with antibiotics are not effective resulting in high rates of relapse, animal and clinical studies have unambiguously demonstrated that antitoxin antibodies are protective against both primary and recurrent CDI. Our goal is to develop novel immunoprophylaxes against both primary and recurrent CDI in aged high-risk populations. In this proposal we aim to exploit two novel compounds (ABBA and cTxAB) developed in this lab: 1) ABBA is a single tetra-specific binding agent consisting of four distinct neutralizing VHH monomers (two against TcdA and two against TcdB); and 2) cTxAB is an atoxic, clostridial toxin-like chimeric vaccine for which a product development plan (PDP) toward clinical trials is currently being developed under NIH funding. We have already demonstrated potent efficacy of ABBA against fulminant CDI in mice. We will further optimize and finalize its delivery strategies in this project. To reduce potential immunogenicity and increase the serum half-life of ABBA for systemic administration, we will generate ABBA-Fc fusions and humanized ABBA-lgGIs without compromising its superior affinity to toxins and neutralizing activity. In addition, we will develop a colonic delivery system for intestinal delivery of ABBA. The lead compounds generated for systemic and oral deliveries will be evaluated in a hamster fulminant CDI model as well as in gnotobiotic piglets colonized with human intestinal flora. Moreover, we will combine the passive ABBA immunization with active cTxAB vaccination and evaluate protection against both primary and recurrent CDI in relevant immunosenescent mouse models. Our ultimate goal is to develop novel immunoprophylaxes and combinations of active and passive immunizations that we wish to prevent against both immediate and longer term CDI threats in aged patients with high risk of developing this debilitating disease. This project will help to achieve the broad objective ofthe entire CETR proposal and to address the hypothesis that we can translate promising immunoprophylactic candidate products being tested in relevant immunosenescent animal models into immune preventions against important enteric pathogens for which the ultimate human targets are elderly subjects."
"9389058","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal seeks continued support for the Yale research-training program in Diabetes Mellitus and Disorders of Metabolism. This program serves as the core source of support for postdoctoral research training in diabetes and endocrinology at the Yale School of Medicine. A major goal of the program is to provide physician-scientists with the research expertise required to pursue clinical, basic and translational research careers in an academic setting. Physician trainees entering the program will have M.D. or M.D./Ph.D. degrees and at least 2-3 years of clinical training in internal medicine or pediatrics. Ph.D. scientists are also recruited into the program since we believe an integrated training experience bringing together adult endocrinologists,  pediatric endocrinologists and endocrine scientists is necessary to prepare our trainees to participate in  modern multidisciplinary research groups. Trainees are selected based on their aptitude and commitment to a  research career. The duration of the training period is three years to ensure an in-depth training experience.  The cornerstone of the curriculum is the participation of each trainee in a specific research project under the supervision of a designated preceptor and guided by a progress committee composed of 2-3 other members of  the training faculty. Potential projects run the gamut from clinical to basic research in 3 primary areas of emphasis: 1) type 1 diabetes, 2) type 2 diabetes, and 3) bone and mineral metabolism. Within these areas, trainees have the opportunity to work with mentors in several basic science departments as well as those in  Pediatrics and Medicine. Close interaction among preceptors and trainees within each programmatic area and  within several multidisciplinary and interdepartmental research centers administered within the Endocrine  Section further enrich the training experience. Multiple educational opportunities including two degree-granting  (MS, PhD) programs are available to trainees through the CTSA-funded Yale Center for Clinical Investigation.  Instruction is also provided through organized lectures, research seminars and journal clubs. The application  requests an additional training slot per year for a total of 6 stipends. This is based on our decision to fully  integrate Yale's pediatric and internal medicine training programs in diabetes and metabolism and, therefore,  not to seek renewal of the pediatric T32 (DK63703). It is also based on our ongoing track record of attracting an outstanding applicant pool, the high level of research productivity of our training faculty, the expanded  research opportunities provided by our diverse faculty and the continued shortage of physician-scientists in  both medicine and pediatrics dedicated to research careers in diabetes and metabolic diseases."
"9449591","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  While nearly all epidemiologic studies involve a certain level of bias, the unique characteristics of the WTC responder cohort (NY/NJ WTC Consortium) have raised concerns regarding the potential impacts of bias in its use for epidemiologic research. The cohort was established shortly after 9/11 (April 2002) to provide health screenings for WTC responders and to create a rapid medical surveillance system. At that time, there were no clear procedural guidelines for how to quickly implement a medical screening system where data are collected in a manner that can later be used for research. Since then, numerous problems have arisen as researchers attempt to utilize this cohort data for epidemiologic research. These problems include: multiple revisions of questionnaires during follow-up health monitoring visits, poor data reliability (missing and unmatched data across follow-ups), low retention rate for follow-up visits (loss to follow-up), and significantly differet rates of referral to treatment from the health monitoring program across the five clinical centers, among others. The previous examples may be fundamental sources of bias. Often WTC health studies discuss some potential biases to explain their findings, such as the healthy worker effect, self-selection bias, and recall bias. However, none of these studies have provided evidence of the presence of bias, and none have quantified the effect of bias on causal inference. The main goal of the proposed study is to assess the impacts of epidemiologic biases in WTC health studies by identifying the presence of bias and then by quantifying and adjusting for the bias effects. To achieve this goal, we will evaluate the impacts of biases on four differen health outcomes with different latencies and severities: sinusitis, asthma, sarcoidosis, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Each of these health outcomes have shown elevated rates among WTC responders, though the associations with WTC exposure were relatively weak. We hypothesize that by identifying and adjusting for bias, the accuracy of WTC health studies can be improved, potentially strengthening associations with health outcomes like the four we propose to study. In this study, bias effects will be evaluated using two approaches: internal-validation data for direct quantification of bias effects and the utilization of published methods or quantifying bias effects when no validation data are available. While the true magnitude of a bias cannot be established with certainty, plausible ranges can be determined and used to generate bias-adjusted estimates of the effects. These bias-adjusted effect estimates are more likely to reflect true health effects. The successful completion of the proposed bias analysis will assist other researchers in drawing plausible inferences on WTC health effects by providing recommendations to identify the presence of, and adjust for bias. In addition, the study will recommend guidelines for future disaster studies which may minimize various sources of bias from the study design through data interpretation."
"9238794","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):Project Summary/Abstract  The human airway suffers genetically determined dysfunctions, such as cystic fibrosis, or environmentally acquired diseases, like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The airway epithelium is characterized by mucus and fluid secretion, regulation  of  ion  homeostasis,  and the presence  of  multiciliated cells,  which generate a directional movement of fluid to transport inhaled particles and pathogens out of the respiratory tract. The apical surface of multiciliated cells is decorated with dozens of motile cilia, that beat synchronously to generate this extracellular fluid flow. Defects arising from impaired motile cilia function or abnormal secretion making these patients susceptible to airway infections. Proton pump inhibitors belong to the most widely prescribed drugs and are often given to hospitalized patients, but increased rates of pneumonia were reported. As multi-resistant pathogens are more frequently found in hospital settings, patients treated with proton pump inhibitors are at high risk. In order to improve the current state of diagnosis, treatment and preventive care of airway diseases, including infections, it is critical t understand how this important barrier against pathogens is established and maintained at the tissue, cell and molecular level. This project will establish an experimental pipeline to efficienty test the effects of signaling pathways, mutations, drugs and pathogens on vertebrate mucociliary epithelia in a comparative manner. In addition to established models (primary human cell culture and mouse airways), I will take advantage of two emerging systems, i.e. the Xenopus embryonic epidermis and immortalized human basal cells (BCi-NS1.1). The Xenopus embryonic epidermis has proven to be an excellent model to study the biology of vertebrate mucociliary epithelia, as it develops fast, is easily accessible to manipulation and analysis, and molecular functions of signaling pathways and transcriptional regulators are conserved between Xenopus and mammals. BCi-NS1.1 cells can be differentiated into mucociliary cells in culture, like primary human airway epithelial cells, but are genetically manipulable. Using these additional emerging models will facilitate new applications to investigate molecular mechanisms in airway mucociliary epithelia. First, this project will resolve the homology of mucociliary cell types across the experimental systems, and establish stable genetically manipulated lines using human BCi-NS1.1 cells. Next, roles of Wnt signaling in mucociliary cell specification, morphogenesis and function will be investigated. Although Wnt signaling is required for normal mucociliary epithelial development and function in Xenopus and mammals, it remains unresolved which cell types require Wnt signaling during which steps of specification and differentiation. The Wnt signaling-dependent transcriptional network will be analyzed  to  determine  functions in  specification, ciliogenesis and secretion. Wnt signaling activation is als pH-dependent and we have found that loss of proton transporters affects gene expression and cell differentiation in mucociliary epithelia. Together with data on the roles of Wnt signaling, experiments manipulating proton pump function will allow me to experimentally address the underlying molecular mechanisms of proton pump dysfunction-associated pneumonia in human patients. In summary, I will use the mucociliary epidermis of Xenopus embryos, in combination with mouse models and cultured human airway cells to resolve homology of mucociliary cell types, functions of the Wnt transcriptional network in mucociliary epithelia, and how transmembrane proton pumps contribute to signaling regulation and respiratory health. The results from this project will expand applications in emerging model systems for airway research, broaden our knowledge of molecular cell signaling mechanisms in mucociliary development and function, and resolve how proton pumps contribute to mucociliary clearance."
"9195090","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Morning hyperglycemia plays a role in the future development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D) and is associated with numerous microvascular and cardiovascular complications and renal disease. These augmented morning glucose levels are due to an elevated endogenous glucose production (EGP), as a result of a loss of coordination between glucose levels and insulin secretion, and possibly hyperglucagonemia during the overnight period. Exercise stimulates glucose uptake and increases insulin sensitivity acutely, and may be the best lifestyle intervention to minimize the nocturnal rise in glucose levels. Prescription of the timing of exercise relative to a meal and/or o the overnight period may be particularly critical for individuals that have impaired fasting glucos (IFG) levels. Surprisingly we know little about the overnight period when elevated EGP and the synchrony between glucose and c-peptide/glucagon levels becomes disturbed. This novel study will provide insight into the hormonal/metabolic milieu of a dinner meal, the evening and overnight period that occurs in non-obese, OB and OB+IFG individuals; it will also establish if the timing of exercise can attenuate nocturnal glucose elevations, and if this is associated with improved hormonal synchrony. This project will compare EGP, ?-cell function and hormonal responses between morning and evening exercise on the postprandial and overnight period in obese individuals with/without IFG levels. Fifty-four subjects will be studied during the evening meal (EGP and ?-cell function), postprandially and through the overnight period (1600-0700 h), allowing us to examine some of the potential mechanisms for the elevation in overnight glucose levels. This is the first study that will examine this issue from pre-dinner through the night whil previous studies have only examined chronically fasted individuals and this study will lay the groundwork for understanding the pathology of the predawn phenomena in OB+IFG individuals. These potentially translational findings may impact the efficiency of physician communication to patients concerning exercise. We are one of the few groups that study subjects through the overnight period and have the facilities and capability to do this research."
"9394574","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mental disorders are neurodevelopmental in origin and often emerge in early life. However, methods are lacking for distinguishing clinically vulnerable young children who are at the start of a chronic clinical pathway from those whose problems are transient. The advent of developmentally-sensitive dimensional measures designed to link to measures of brain function provides a potent opportunity to enhance accuracy of prevention targets. Integration of these dimensions with developmentally-based neuroscientific methods generates a novel, truly neurodevelopmental perspective with which to advance NIMH Strategic Plan Goal 1.4, to develop, for research purposes, new ways of classifying mental disorders based on dimensions of observable behavior and neurobiological measures. Disruptive behavior is an ideal venue for applying this approach as it emerges early, and is antecedent to up to 60% of adult mental disorders. Further, specific component dimensions of disruptive behavior, i.e., irritability and callous/unemotional traits, predict differential clinical courses and patterns of neural disruption in older clinical samples. Recent findings from our MAPS Study provide support for these patterns in preschoolers. The overarching goal of this competitive renewal is to identify developmentally-sensitive markers of atypical irritability and callous traits at an early phase of the pathophysiological pathway, and t demonstrate the ability of these markers to distinguish young children at highest risk for chronic mental disorder. We propose a longitudinal follow-up of the MAPS Study (1R01MH082830), a diverse cohort of 400 preschoolers (3-5 yrs.). We capitalize on MAPS' developmentally-sensitive dimensional assessment of irritability (Temper Loss), callous traits (Low Concern for Others), and associated neurocognitive markers. The proposed study links these early childhood data to early school age (6-8 yrs.) and pre-adolescent (9-10 yrs.) outcomes. SPECIFIC AIMS: (I) Specify dimensional attributes of early childhood Temper Loss and Low Concern that predict chronic clinical patterns; (II) Specify dimensional attributes of early childhood Temper Loss and Low Concern that predict pre- adolescent neurocognitive disruptions, including task-based fMRI brain activity in a neuroimaging subsample (n=120); (III) Test the incremental utility of jointly considering early childhood Temper Loss and Low Concern dimensional attributes and neurocognitive markers to enhance prediction of continuities and discontinuities. Utilizing information about early life atypicalities in brain: behavior relations to predict course of mental disorder will advance the goal of predicting mental health outcomes. Study findings will lay the groundwork for targeted prevention designed to alter lifespan trajectories of mental disorder at early stages."
"9440468","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this UM1 application is to maintain and enhance the core infrastructure of the Breast Cancer Family Registry (BCFR), an international resource of multi-generational families established for interdisciplinary collaborative research on breast cancer. The BCFR Cohort, established in 1995 at 6 sites is comprised of 34,000 individuals from 11,900 families who provided data on family history and epidemiologic risk factors as well as bio specimens. Over the next five years, the BCFR investigator team will continue 1) to actively follow the family cohort using common instruments and protocols, update the cancer family histories to identify new breast and other cancers in the families, and administer a follow-up questionnaire to update baseline epidemiologic data; 2) to maintain the extensive data and bio specimen resources and enhance them by conducting pathology review for all new breast cancers ascertained since baseline, completing molecular sub typing of tumors, and completing genotyping of known common breast cancer susceptibility variants; 3) to collect new data on screening, uptake of risk reductive and preventive health behaviors, knowledge of genetic disease, and uptake of genetic testing and communication to family members that will facilitate the translation of findings into clinical practice; and 4) to continue and expand collaborations with external investigators by sharing of BCFR data and bio specimen resources for a wide range of studies of gene discovery, cancer-related outcomes, risk factors in high-risk individuals, behavioral interventions and cancer prevention trials among at-risk family members. The BCFR Cohort is unique in that it is family-based and the first large prospective study of breast cancer risk for women at a continuum of risk. In addition to the unaffected cohort, the BCFR has one of the largest affected cohorts and will therefore provide a powerful resource for translational and clinical studies of recurrences, second primaries and survival."

"9187495","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal structural and functional connectivity (interaction between brain regions) is central to the pathophysiology of psychotic illnesses like schizophrenia and psychotic bipolar disorder. Modern neuroimaging techniques and analytic strategies provide an unprecedented capacity to more fully characterize the functional and structural psychotic disconnectivity. Individuals with psychotic illness and their unaffected relatives have abnormal connectivity, suggesting that at least a portion of psychotic disconnectivity is associated with genetic predisposition for the diseases. Imaging-based connectivity endophenotypes are ideally suited to aid the functional characterization of putative risk genes, allowing us to move beyond a genotype-phenotype association to delineating mechanisms that give rise to psychotic illnesses. Recently, large-scale exome sequencing in individuals of European ancestry provided the strongest evidence to date for specific genetic variants that increase risk for psychosis. These primarily rare mutations were spread across gene networks involved in neuronal processes, including calcium channels and postsynaptic signaling. Our goals are to replicate these promising genetic findings in a different ethnic group, African-Americans, and determine whether and how these gene sets impact psychotic disconnectivity. African-Americans, an underserved population, have ~32% more highly deleterious non-synonymous rare variants in these networks than individuals of European ancestry, improving our power to detect rare variants. Our aims are to: (1) use modern MRI acquisition and analysis techniques based on the Human Connectome Project to document psychotic disconnectivity in 750 African Americans (375 with a psychotic disorder and 375 demographically matched comparison subjects). We will test hypotheses that diagnostic and dimensional indices of psychosis are associated with reduced global functional connectivity but intact global structural connectivity, combined with aberrant connectivity between specific regions or tracts; (2) conduct whole exome sequencing (WES) to test the influence of rare non-synonymous variants from genes in previously identified gene sets on psychosis risk using a network-centered analysis strategy. We will test hypotheses that the voltage-gated calcium ion channel, and the ARC-associated scaffold protein and the NMDAR postsynaptic signaling complexes influence diagnostic and dimensional indices of psychosis; and (3) apply this same network-centric test to determine if gene sets implicated in illness risk also influence functional and structural psychotic disconnectivity. Linking these genetic pathways to psychotic disconnectivity will provide mechanistic insights into the genomic influences on psychotic illness. Our collaborative application includes sites at Yale/Hartford Hospital (DC Glahn PI), Stanford (RA Poldrack PI) and Texas Biomedical Research Institute (J Blangero PI). Our results should bolster our understanding of the genetic architecture of psychotic illness and provide important clues for traversing the chasm between identified genetic networks and the behaviorally defined disorder."

"9328948","The prediction of tumor response to chemotherapy can be achieved by elucidating the efficiency of drug delivery to the targeted tumor cells, and the effectiveness of the delivered drug to be activated and act on tumor cells. A non-invasive means that can answer these questions is essential for designing efficient and personalized therapy, and is especially crucial to improve the efficacy of treating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), one of the most lethal human malignancies. In the present study, we propose to develop a highly translatable MRI technology to answer the two questions mentioned above in the gemcitabine treatment of PADC, and hence to predict tumor responses. In particular, Our approach is based on a so-called Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) MRI contrast mechanism, by which drugs are imaged directly by their inherently carried exchangeable protons (OH, NH or NH2), at a detectability comparable to that for Gd-based agents. Formulated on the basis of our preliminary results, we hypothesize that agents that contain cytosine and cytidine, for instance gemcitabine, can be detected using CEST MRI, namely cytCEST. We anticipate our approach can be used to predict tumor response to the gemcitabine treatment by assessing the accumulation, biodistribution and retention of the drug in the tumor, without the need for imaging tags or additional agents. To achieve our goal, we will first optimize and validate the cytCEST MRI detection of tumor uptake and biodistribution of gemcitabine. Then we will develop cytCEST MRI as an effective means to detect the activity of deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), one of the most important drug-resistance-related enzymes. Finally the potential of cytCEST MRI to predict the response of pancreatic tumors to therapy will be examined on the treatment in KPC genetically engineered mouse models using three different gemcitabine-based treatments. Successful completion of this project will result in an imaging tool for the prediction of tumor response to gemcitabine using the drug or its analog deoxycytidine directly as the imaging agent, namely label-free because no chemical-modification is needed. It is expected that such a label-free approach can be rapidly translated to the clinic, allowing clinicians to stratify patients prior to (or immediately after) the administration of gemcitabine or other cytosine- or cytidine-based chemotherapeutic drugs and to choose the personalized treatment plan for each group of patients."
"9222027","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuron populations in the hypothalamus and hindbrain form nodes within a larger distributed network to control multiple aspects of feeding behavior in mammals. The goal of this project is to identify and map arcade hypothalamic circuits that respond to circulating hormones that control feeding behavior. At the heart of this project lies a novel combination of functional neuroanatomical techniques: tract-tracing, wide-field and multi- fluorescence imaging, reference atlas-based mapping, and data deposition within an online neuron informatics database. These methods are being brought to bear on the arcuate hypothalamus, because it has remained a relatively uncharted and poorly defined brain structure that is otherwise critical for feeding behavior. Knowledge of the basic circuit organization of this structure, through its complete three dimensional expanse, is critical for scientists to be able to further experimentally manipulate selected sub-populations of neurons in this structure to study various aspects of feeding control. This, in turn, is expected to yield novl targets within the brain suitable for designing rationale therapeutics and treatments to help prevent or mitigate the effects of obesity, overeating, and metabolic disorders."
"9231372","The filoviruses are NIAID/CDC Category A biodefense pathogens that cause severe and rapidly progressing hemorrhagic fever with 50-90% human lethality. There are currently no FDA-approved vaccines or therapies for filovirus infection. Among the filoviruses, the Zaire Ebola virus species (EBOV) has been most extensively characterized. However, outbreaks ofthe Sudan Ebola virus species (SUDV) and Marburg virus (MARV) have been occurring with increased frequency and can be just as lethal as EBOV. Further, the pathogenic Bundibugyo Ebola virus species (BDBV) re-emerged in 2012 with increased lethality. Immunotherapy was recently demonstrated to provide post-exposure protection to EBOV challenge in nonhuman primates (NHPs). For MARV, convalescent sera from immunized NHPs can provide similar protection, suggesting that immunotherapy for all filoviruses will be tractable in humans. A robust pipeline of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting EBOV exists and will be developed in Project 1, but the pipeline for SUDV and MARV mAbs is less complete. Not a single SUDV or MARV mAb or mAb cocktail therapy has been evaluated in NHPs. Currently, there are no neutralizing BDBV mAbs. The goal of Project 2 is to fill these gaps in the filovirus therapeutic mAb portfolio. Among consortium investigators, a total of 216 murine mAbs against SUDV or MARV are available but have not been completely characterized; we will develop these mAbs and evaluate them for protection in rodent models and NHPs. In addition, we will identify new SUDV and MARV mAbs from human survivors of infection from outbreaks in Uganda, especially those in 2012. The consortium investigators have unprecedented access to four separate survivor cohorts of SUDV and MARV infection, and have demonstrated recently that neutralizing mAbs exist in peripheral blood of survivors. In addition, we will identify and characterize new anti-BDBV and broadly reactive anti-filovirus mAbs. Preliminary ELISA studies indicate that antibodies with cross-reactivity for the envelope glycoprotein (GP) from SUDV, BDBV and (in some cases) EBOV exist in peripheral blood of survivors who have been exposed to only a single filovirus species. We will use human hybridoma and antibody phage display technologies to screen the lymphocytes of survivors of filovirus infection for new BDBV and cross neutralizing filovirus mAbs. The most promising candidates will be further evaluated in rodent and nonhuman primate challenge models. The end-point of this work will be a robust pipeline of mAbs for these understudied and re-emerging filoviruses."
"9415495","DESCRIPTION: Vermont PROSPR Research Center (VPRC): Breast cancer screening has led to substantial reductions in breast cancer mortality in the United States over the past 30 years, but not without unintended harms and shortcomings. Comprehensive, population-based, longitudinal data on the entire screening process can evaluate current screening practices and recommend improvements. The Vermont Prosper Research Center (VPRC) proposes to continue and extend the work of the Vermont Breast Cancer Surveillance System (VBCSS), which has 16 years of experience in collecting integrated patient risk factor, breast imaging, pathology, treatment, cancer outcome and vital status data. Our first aim is to document the entire breast cancer screening process in community practice across the state of Vermont. The new data collected will add to our 16 years of longitudinal data, which provide the foundation for our proposed research program, data sharing with the Statistical Coordination Center, and collaborations with other PROSPR sites. Second, we will pursue a research program that improves the screening process by developing prognostic markers that can be used to develop personalized management strategies for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Using longitudinal data on approximately 1400 DClS cases from the VBCSS, we will seek to identify novel molecular, morphologic, radiologic, and tumor microenvironment markers that can stratify DClS patients by risk of progression to invasive disease. Our comparative effectiveness analyses will provide a framework by which new DClS prognostic markers can be evaluated for their potential impacts on the benefits and harms of screening. Third, we will conduct collaborative research with other PROSPR Research Centers, the PROSPR Statistical Coordination Center, the National Cancer Institute, and the larger research community. Our multidisciplinary team of experienced basic, clinical, and population scientists will lead and participate in trans-Network initiatives and ensure the dissemination of our data and study findings. Accomplishment of these aims will provide a rich source of data for use in evaluating and improving current breast cancer screening processes. Success in our research program will fill an urgent need for identification of DClS prognostic markers that could enable personalized management strategies."
"9276781","PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT Angiogenesis, or formation of new vasculature from pre-existing vessels, is a complex process coordinated by multiple cell types including endothelial (EC) and smooth muscle (SM) cells of the vessel wall. Notch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway required in ECs for developmental, reparative and pathological angiogenesis and collaborates with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-dependent signaling to optimize organization and competency of neovasculature. These signals in ECs are especially relevant in contexts of pathological hypoxia induced by ischemia or hypoxemia, wherein low tissue oxygen levels trigger hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) transcriptional activity governing production of critical angiogenic factors including VEGF. Despite their juxtaposition to ECs within the vessel wall, much less is known of the contribution of SM to the angiogenic process in health or disease. We have previously shown that heterotypic cell interactions support instructional signaling between SM Notch ligands and EC Notch receptors. These contacts modulate EC gene expression and function and mice deficient in SM Notch signaling display impaired physiological angiogenesis. We now suggest that SM Notch signaling is required for adaptive angiogenesis induced by pathological hypoxia. We have identified a functional synergism between Notch and HIF signaling pathways in SM under hypoxic conditions and demonstrate a reciprocal dependence on target gene expression including the augmentation of Notch ligand and VEGF. Therefore, Notch signaling in SM appears necessary for HIF activity induced by hypoxia. These findings further suggest that enhanced Notch ligand and SM-derived VEGF act as juxtacrine and paracrine influences on EC behavior. Hence, the major themes in this project proposal include the identification of molecular mechanisms in SM that underlie functional synergism between Notch and HIF signaling and the characterization of hypoxic vascular SM impact on angiogenesis. In Aim 1, we interrogate molecular crosstalk between components of Notch and HIF pathways. Aim 2 measures EC responses in co-culture with select Notch/HIF-deficient SM. Aim 3 characterizes angiogenic capacity in animals with combined deficiency in SM Notch/HIF through distinct models of pathologically induced hypoxia. Together, our experimental approaches include a full spectrum of in vivo, ex vivo and in vitro vascular analyses necessary for understanding novel mechanisms of angiogenic control."

"9450950","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Candidate: Dr. Demoruelle is an Instructor of Medicine in the Division of Rheumatology where she has 80% of her full-time professional effort committed to her research projects investigating the role of the lung in the pre- clinical period o rheumatoid arthritis (RA) development. She also has a 10% clinical appointment at National Jewish Health (NJH), and 10% effort for education and administrative activities. To date, her dedication to this field of research is evident by her 3 first-author peer-reviewed publications, 3 first-author review article publications, 5 grant funding awards for which she is the principal investigator including the NIH Loan Repayment Award, and her many presentations at national and international scientific meetings. In line with her career development plan for this award, her immediate career goals are to expand her prior studies to determine the lung is an originating site of autoimmunity in RA as this will serve as the foundation for future independent re- search endeavors. Her additional immediate career goals include establishing herself as a leader in the field of preclinical RA research and completing her doctoral degree in clinical investigation from the University of Colorado Denver in May 2017. With the assistance of her expert mentoring team that is organized for this K23 award, as well as her other established mentoring teams that include her PhD thesis committee and her Scientist Development Award mentoring committee, she will obtain the assistance and instruction to successfully complete the aims of the proposed K23 project. The new research skills, resultant data, and mentorship that arise from this project will lay the groundwork so that she can achieve her long term career goals to become an independent scientist in the field of preclinical RA research, and ultimately understand the mechanisms that initiate RA so that effective strategies targeting these mechanisms can be applied to prevent RA. Environment: Dr. Demoruelle has a commitment from her Department and Division heads that ensures her 80% protected time for the research and career development activities detailed in this K23 proposal. She has access to subjects for recruitment for this project from the novel NIH-funded Studies of the Etiology of RA (SERA) cohort as well as clinics at the University of Colorado (CU) and NJH. Because NJH is a leading US hospital for respiratory medicine and research, she will have access to recruit unique subjects with lung dis- ease for this project as well as future projects. At CU, she will have the full support of the Clinical and Translational Research Center Core Laboratory located at Children's Hospital Colorado that is a pulmonary fluid processing center, the CU Denver Microbiome Research Consortium that is a leading institute in studies of the human microbiome, and the Colorado Biostatistics Consortium. At CU, she will continue her doctoral studies in clinical investigation through the CU Denver graduate program in Clinical Science with an expected graduation date of May 2017. Her doctoral thesis project is entitled, The Lung as an Initiating Site of Autoimmunity in RA, and it is in-line with the proposed project of her K23 application. Furthermore, Dr. Demoruelle will have access to the larger research community at CU including Divisional, Departmental, and University-wide research forums where she will be able to present her research and receive feedback, as well as attend a variety of presentations regarding state-of-the-art advances related to her research areas. In addition to protected time and financial support, Dr. Demoruelle currently has an office, computer with word processing and statistical software, telephone, printer, copy/fax machine and secretarial support provided by the Division of Rheumatology that will be extended throughout the duration of this career development award. Research: The overall hypothesis of this project is that autoimmunity in RA originates in the lung, and the initiation of RA in the lung is related to specific bacterial community compositions in the lung. This hypothesis is based on prior data from our lab demonstrating that circulating RA-related autoantibodies (Abs) and airways inflammation precede joint inflammation in RA, and utilizing induced sputum testing, RA-related Abs appear to be generated in the lung in some individuals who are in the preclinical RA period. In addition, preliminary data from our lab suggest that longitudinal changes in lung RA-related Abs and differences in lung bacterial compositions in subjects who are in the preclinical period of RA development will provide novel insight into the etiology of RA. In this K23 proposal, we build upon these findings and use simultaneously collected sputum and se- rum samples in subjects with early clinically-diagnosed RA, subjects at risk for future RA based on familial or serologic biomarker risk factors, and healthy controls. In cross-section, we will perform comparative studies of RA-related Abs in sputum and serum with the hypothesis that Abs will be more prevalent in the sputum than the serum in subjects with RA and subjects at risk for RA suggesting their generation in the lung. In longitudinal studies, we will evaluate the stability and evolution of RA-related Abs in the sputum and serum to further determine the lung origin of these Abs as well as to identify specific autoimmune responses that represent the earliest targets of RA-related autoimmunity in the lung. Finally, we will utilize the sputum samples from these subjects to characterize bacteria (specific taxa and larger communities) that are associated with RA-related Abs in the lung, suggesting these bacteria may be involved in the lung generation of RA-related autoimmunity."

"9238395","Background: This R01 is in response to PAR-13-130: Understanding and Promoting Health Literacy (R01). Health literacy is the degree to which an individual can obtain, process, and understand basic health information, which includes the ability to understand written questionnaires. Almost none of the survey instruments being used across the country has been validated for use with people who have low health literacy. This fundamental cross-cutting weakness in survey methods undermines the accuracy of a broad swath of data collected in research and clinical care. Written questionnaires are omnipresent in healthcare, including patient demographic forms, symptom assessment tools, and patient-reported outcome questionnaires. The NIH has invested heavily in the creation of the NIH Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), which has significantly advanced health measurement. But PROMIS, like almost all survey instruments, has not been validated for use by people with low health literacy and it exists in a written format that may be inaccessible to individuals with low literacy. Aims: We will remove health literacy barriers to accurate survey research by: 1) evaluating differences in psychometric properties by health literacy of PROMIS questionnaires as well as other commonly used surveys; 2) identifying and characterizing survey items that do not work properly for people with low health literacy; and, 3) creating a guide for survey item development and evaluation for different modes of test administration that are most appropriate for people who have low health literacy. Methods: We will recruit a large sample of participants across two primary care networks at Northwestern Universtiy and Boston University Medical Center. The sample will be evenly balanced across English versus Spanish language and adequate versus low health literacy. These assessments will be given at multiple time points as part of a longitudinal study. We will use state-of-the-art psychometric methods to determine differences among participants with low versus adequate health literacy, and whether these differences can be overcome by alternative modes of survey administration. Impact: We will identify survey item characteristics that are associated with differential item functioning by health literacy for different modes of test administration. Based on our analyses, we will create a guide for survey item development and evaluation. This will lead to assessments in healthcare that are more accessible for people with low health literacy and more accurate. This project has broad relevance insofar as many widely-used health questionnaires have not been validated for use with people who have low health literacy. We will present a generalizable approach that can rapidly influence the mode of data collection from patients. We will also present modes of data analyses oriented toward understanding health-literacy, which is a critical component of survey validation activities."

"9237238","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Researchers have acknowledged for decades that the small-molecule restoration of wild type p53 function in tumors is one of the ultimate, yet elusive goals in cancer drug development. TP53 is the most commonly mutated gene in cancer and loss of its function is one of the central drivers of tumorigenesis. The majority of mutations are missense and generate a defective protein found at high levels in cancer cells. The p53-R175H is the most common missense mutant and is misfolded because the substitution impairs the protein's ability to bind zinc. We discovered a zinc chelating small-molecule (ZMC1) that can restore wild type structure/function to the p53-R175H by restoring zinc-binding and facilitating proper folding (so-called zinc metallochaperone (ZMC) mechanism). ZMC1 reactivates mutant p53 and selectively kills cancer cells by a p53 mediated apoptotic program both in vitro and in vivo. The pharmacologic restoration of a folding defect in a metalloprotein by metal ion delivery is unprecedented in drug development. We found that other zinc chelators with a similar affinity (Kd) for zinc can function as ZMCs and ZMCs can reactivate other mutants with impaired zinc-binding. Therefore, we hypothesize that ZMCs can be developed as effective mutant p53 targeted anti-cancer drugs. This will be investigated through the following specific aims: 1) Determine the impact of zinc homeostatic mechanisms on ZMC1 pharmacodynamics. Cells respond to the ZMC1 surge in zinc levels by normalizing zinc through homeostatic mechanisms. We hypothesize that these mechanisms regulate ZMC1 activity. We will explore this through mechanistic studies that measure the effect on ZMC1 activity of manipulating zinc regulatory genes in tumors cells. 2) Define the p53 mis-sense mutational spectrum that is amenable to ZMC reactivation. ZMC1 is proposed to reactivate the mutant class with impaired zinc binding; however the full spectrum of this class is unknown. We hypothesize that the mutants closest to the zinc-binding pocket are most likely to have impaired zinc binding. We will study the 15 most frequent mutants within 10Å of the zinc-binding pocket. This will define the potential patient poo for ZMCs. 3) Design a ZMC optimized for potency, toxicity, and efficacy in vivo. We have designed novel chemotypes that have ZMC activity and are more potent than ZMC1 in vitro. We will validate these results in vivo.  Our team is composed of three laboratories that are leading this area of research. Their expertise is the following: 1) p53 biology (Darren Carpizo), Zinc/p53 folding biophysics (Stewart Loh), and zinc chelator drug design (David Augeri). Relevance to public health: The research performed in this proposal will provide the foundation for the development of a new class of anti-cancer drugs that target the most commonly mutated gene in human cancer. These drugs will have broad activity against all types of cancers."
"9447324","The Development of Targeted Therapies for Peroxisome Biogenesis Disorders: Current and future prospects conference will provide a forum for multidisciplinary investigators to discuss emerging therapeutic opportunities for peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs). Our overarching goal is to develop a roadmap for PBD therapeutic development based on the discussions that originate from and extend beyond this conference. PBDs are a disease spectrum that impacts the functions of multiple organ systems, with the most profound effects on the central nervous system, and leads to a shortened life span. In addition to the neurological aspects of disease, patients most typically manifest a progressive loss of vision and hearing as well as respiratory, hepatic, renal, and skeletal abnormalities. The therapeutic roadmap generated as a result of this conference will be used by clinically-oriented colleagues and relevant disease foundations, the Global Foundation for Peroxisomal Disorders (GFPD) and RhizoKids International, to plan for future translational research initiatives. The audience will be comprised of a diverse community of individuals with complementary areas of expertise including physician-scientists who treat patients with PBDs, translational researchers, basic scientists, and patient advocates, all of whom share an interest in therapeutic initiatives for rare diseases, including PBDs. Special emphasis will be placed on the participation of junior investigators and trainees, with the expectation that they will provide novel ideas and perspectives and also benefit from interacting with the community-based therapeutic planning efforts at the conference. Participants from underrepresented communities in the neurosciences and general medical sciences will provide important perspectives and be involved in critical discussions about patient recruitment and access to newly developed treatments. The diverse scientific community and patient advocates participating at this conference will allow for a cross-fertilization of ideas relevant to translational research that may not be achievable in more general meetings, such as those of the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ASGCT) and the American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG)."
"9240275","PROJECT SUMMARY  The progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength, a condition known as sarcopenia, is perhaps the most debilitating age-associated alteration. In sarcopenia, muscle strength/power decrease significantly more than muscle mass itself, suggesting that it is the overall quality of the muscle that is affected and not only the size or quantity of muscle. Muscle fatigue occurs when the intended physical activity can no longer be continued or is perceived as involving excessive effort. Unfortunately, many elderly suffer from fatigue at physical efforts far less (i.e. walking) than the efforts that are required to induce fatigue in healthy young people. Force generation in muscle is tightly coupled to the release and subsequent re-sequestering of Ca2+ by the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Dysfunction in the Ca2+ handling process has been strongly implicated in the loss of force production in many fatigue producing situations, and it has been suggested that Ca2+ handling impairment may significantly contribute to skeletal muscle failure in sarcopenia. It is also known that tissue hypoxia is greater in aged muscle, and this may exacerbate the mechanisms contributing to Ca2+ handling failure. We have demonstrated that there is a range of reduced O2 availability that will induce ?metabolic adaptation? to maintain mitochondrial respiration and energy generation (of which Ca2+ handling may require more than 40%!). Lower intracellular O2 levels in aged muscle will result in a more perturbed intracellular milieu, resulting in an impaired muscle function--in part due to negative effects on the Ca2+ handling process. The interplay between O2 availability and Ca2+ handling on skeletal muscle dysfunction in the elderly has not been carefully investigated, and in particular, treatments for this impairment have not been analyzed. The purpose of this proposed research is to use mouse isolated whole muscle and an intact single skeletal muscle fiber to: 1) test a number of hypotheses centered around the notion that cellular O2 (at levels well above those limiting mitochondrial respiration) induce alterations in the intracellular environment that affect Ca2+ handling in aged muscle, thereby leading to an earlier onset of contractile impairment in hypoxia. And most importantly: 2) test treatments and transgenic models which affect different components of the Ca2+ handling process in an attempt to develop therapeutic strategies for combating O2-related Ca2+ handling dysfunction and thereby alleviate some of the muscle impairment in sarcopenia. Our experimental models allow precise control of the extracellular environment and the intracellular environment can be carefully monitored using non-invasive fluorescent imaging techniques. It is the goal of this research project to use our unique single myofiber model to carefully elucidate the mechanisms by which reduced cellular PO2 in aged muscle impairs Ca2+ handling and contractility, and to subsequently develop strategies to reduce frailty associated Ca2+ handling impairments in older subjects."
"9431523","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): G-protein signaling pathways control virtually every process in the body. At any time, the output of a particular neuron reflects the integration of several signaling pathways, while the neurological response of the organism requires the coordination of many more pathways operating in different brain regions, circuits and cell types. Our laboratory focused on how the diversity and specificity of these signaling pathways are encoded in the ??? subunit structures of the G-proteins. Historically, the diverse ? subtypes were assumed to specify their signaling roles. However, our work has challenged this dogma with the discovery of diverse ? subtypes whose unique signaling functions are identified for the first time. Notably, our production of Gng7-/- mice provides irrefutable proof that the ?7 subtype performs a novel role in the striatum by directing the ordered assembly of a specific G-?olf?2?7 heterotrimer that operates downstream of the D1 dopamine and A2a adenosine receptors in striatum. Forming the basis for this proposal, loss of the ?7 protein disrupts the G-?olf?2?7 assembly and produces defective morphine responsiveness. Because of the global nature of the gene deletion, it is not clear whether the defective morphine responsiveness reflects a requirement for the G-?olf?2?7 heterotrimer acting downstream of the D1 dopamine receptor (D1R) in striato-nigral neurons, the A2a adenosine receptor (A2aR) in striato-pallidal neurons, or both receptors. Accordingly, we will use our newly created conditional Gng7mice: 1) to genetically dissect the cell type specific roles of the G- G- ?olf?2?7 heterotrimer in mediating spontaneous and acquired behaviors; 2) to identify the cellular basis and the affected signaling pathway(s); and 3) to explore to what extent the G-?olf?2?7 heterotrimer composition influences the ligand binding properties of these receptors. This new knowledge may eventually lead to the development of better strategies to prevent or ameliorate prescription opiate abuse that currently costs the US government $300 billion a year."
"9233061","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is strong evidence to support 'tonic signaling' as central feature in the developmental process leading from pre-B cells to mature, fully competent B cells. These signals are thought to be mediated through the pre-B Cell Receptor (pre-BCR) and essential for pre-B cell protection from apoptosis. This proposal is based upon the central hypothesis that B Cell Precursor Acute Lympoblastic Leukemia (BCP-ALL) blasts also require this pre-BCR survival mechanism, which may contribute to resistance to standard chemotherapeutic challenges and modulate proliferative rates. Moreover, tonic signaling from the pre-BCR is proposed to occur through 1) transient dimerization that occurs through self-association of the l5 component of the surrogate light chain and 2) galectin-mediated crosslinking of pre-BCR, forming more stable pre-BCR dimers and potentially higher- order oligomers. To test these concepts, this study will incorporate state-of-the-art imaging methods, including single particle tracking, FRAP and hyperspectral imaging. This pre-BCR dimerization initiates lyn-mediated phosphorylation of Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Activation Motifs (ITAMs) on the cytoplasmic tails of pre- BCR signaling components (Ig? and Ig?). ITAM phosphorylation leads to recruitment of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and activation of downstream signaling cascades involved in cell fate decisions. Readouts of these key events will be based on co-immunoprecipitation, anti-PY western blotting and proximity ligation. Another major goal of this proposal is to develop peptidomimetic inhibitors to block pre-BCR dimerization and tonic signaling. This phase of the project will use molecular dynamic approaches to design inhibitory peptides using a stringent scoring criteria, followed by experiments to optimize binding and to test for disruption of the pre-BCR self- association and/or galectin-binding interfaces using the advanced imaging technologies and cell signaling assays. Later, the generated peptides will be used to screen phage and yeast libraries to develop scFv that can bind to the pre-BCR subcomponents with high affinity. The overall goal is to develop monovalent, biologic agents (peptidomimetics, scFv-Fc) that bind with high-affinity to the pre-BCR and block prosurvival signaling. The scFv-Fc will be evaluated for the potential to recruit NK cells and macrophages for antibody-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) or phagocytosis (ADCP), a critical first step for development of anti-pre-BCR therapeutic antibodies."
"9307322","This is a year -25 renewal request that addresses a recognized challenge in medicinal inorganic chemistry, namely moving beyond platinum in oncology. To do this, a set of texaphyrin-gold conjugates is proposed. These systems will help overwhelm the antioxidant defense network essential to tumor growth via two overlapping mechanisms. They will also build on progress made in recent years under this grant that has led to very promising texaphyrin-platinum conjugates that display improved efficacy and reduced toxicity relative to FDA-approved agents, such as oxaliplatin. However, this proposal addresses a new challenge, namely using texaphyrins to deliver gold(I) N-heterocyclic carbene complexes to tumors. There is a strong mechanistic rationale for doing so. We have recently shown that uniquely designed, N-hetrocyclic carbene Au(I) complexes give rise to enhanced inhibition of antioxidant activity in cancer models as a result of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) inhibition. On the other hand, texaphyrins are known to increase oxidative stress through redox cycling. This complementarity is unique and exciting. It should allow us to target the antioxidant protective network from two different directions and do so in a tumor-selective manner. To test the promise inherent in this hypothesis, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1. Synthesize texaphyrin-Au(I) conjugates containing both labile and non-labile linkages. Use N- heterocyclic carbenes to control gold complexation. Aim 2. Assess the ability of the texaphyrin-Au conjugates to affect the antioxidant network. Use MTT assays to assess anti-proliferation activity in well-studied cancer cell lines and use flow cytometry to screen for oxidative stress response. Aim 3. Study texaphyrin-Au conjugate cellular uptake and compartmentalization in vitro. Use analyses of metal content (Gd, Au) and LCMS measurements of texaphyrin concentration in cellular and organ digests to confirm whole cell uptake and subcellular localization. Aim 4. Begin studies of toxicity and efficacy in vivo. Use murine models to determine the tolerability and biodistribution of the most promising texaphyrin-Au conjugates and their ability to localize to solid tumors and inhibit tumor growth in vivo."

"9313930","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Blood cell traits, including hemoglobin level, red blood cell (RBC), white blood cell (WBC), and platelet counts, are important intermediate clinical phenotypes for a variety of cardiovascular, hematologic, oncologic, immunologic and infectious disease. The distributions of these traits differ considerably across ethnicities. For example, further insight into the genetic determinants of ethnic neutropenia in African Americans (AA) may have implications for health disparities in risk of HIV infection, sickle cell disease severity or mobilization of neutrophils or hematopoietic stem cells in cancer patients. Our preliminary data similarly suggest important differences in the distribution of blood cell traits in Hispanics compared to non-Hispanic whites. Therefore, the proposed studies are likely to have direct clinical impact by providing new avenues for treatment, particularly for minority patients with low blood counts (Personalized Medicine), and illuminating new mechanisms by which genetic factors related to ethnic differences in blood cell counts contribute to U.S. health disparities fo risk of chronic inflammatory and thrombotic diseases.  Despite the importance of genetic factors in explaining variation in blood cell traits, there remains a huge gap in our knowledge of the contribution of specific loci to these traits among U.S. minorities. Coincidentally, multiethnic GWAS has been recognized as more powerful for gene mapping by the genetics community. However, there are very few sequencing-aided GWAS for blood cell traits in ancestrally diverse populations, and none in Hispanics/Latinos (HLs). Consequently, innovative methods are needed to study blood cell traits in multiethnic cohorts, particularly those recently admixed such as AA and HL, which have been under- represented in prior GWAS. The first attempts to map genes for blood cell traits in AA did not incorporate sequence based African specific content into the imputation, were limited in sample size, and did not accounted for local ancestry, mainly due to the lack of available methods and resources. Importantly, no GWAS have been conducted in HL for blood cell traits. For the proposed studies, our team has now assembled a new, larger collection of AA (n~34K), HL (n~26K) and Europeans (EU) (n~30K), and will leverage our recent methodological advances in imputation, local ancestry inference, and association analysis to increase our knowledge of blood cell trait genetics.  We propose the following Aims. Aim 1. Map genes for blood cell traits in AA (n~34K) accounting for local ancestry. Aim 2. Conduct the first sequencing-aided GWAS of blood cell traits in HL (n~26K) accounting for 3- way local ancestry. Aim 3. Meta-analyze across multi-ethnic datasets, annotate and validate novel association signals."
"9256596","Project Summary Regulatory T (Treg) cells characterized by the expression of the transcription factor forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) play a central role in the control of immune tolerance to self-antigens, allergens, and commensals as well as immune responses to pathogens and tumors. mTORC1 is a master growth regulator that is essential for Treg cell function in vivo, as mice with Treg cell-specific loss of mTORC1 develop rampant autoimmune disease and die at an early age. mTORC1 integrates signals that reflect the availability of growth factors and the nutritional status of an organism. Amino acids is an essential nutrient metabolite that makes up the majority of mammalian cell mass and functions as critical regulator of mTORC1 signaling. Nevertheless, whether amino acid sensing plays a role in Treg cell function remains elusive. To this end, this proposal will study the role of the Rag GTPases dependent amino acid-sensing pathway in Treg cell homeostasis and function. Preliminary studies revealed that constitutive activation of this pathway resulted in deregulated Treg cell homeostasis and precipitated immune activations in mice, most prominently at sites where Treg cells are constantly bathed in fluctuating levels of nutrients, such as the liver and the intestine. It is thus hypothesized that repression of the amino acid-sensing pathway is essential for Treg cells to maintain stable expression of Treg cell characteristic molecules and suppressive function, and the lack of this negative regulation results in overt immune activation. This proposal seeks to characterize how constitutive activation of the amino acid-sensing pathway affect Treg cells by characterizing the proliferation, survival, and suppressive function of Treg cells. Furthermore, this study will investigate if deregulation of the amino acid-sensing pathway bypasses the stringent requirement of strong T cell receptor and IL-2 signaling in proliferating Treg cells, resulting in the generation of defective Treg cells. Finally, this study will investigate if constitutively activated amino acid sensing affects Treg cell functions in chronic viral infection and cancer. Together, this research will shed light on how the sensing of amino acid affects Treg cell homeostasis and function. From a clinical standpoint, altered Treg cell homeostasis can contribute to the pathogenesis of a variety of human diseases including infections and cancers. Thus, this proposed research may uncover ways to modulate immunity and inflammation for therapeutic benefit."
"9208135","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early life, and especially prenatal, exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may be related to poor health outcomes later in life, including neurodevelopmental delays and disorders. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurological disorder with high societal and personal impact, and of unknown but likely complex causes. Environmental factors are hypothesized to contribute to at least 50% of the risk of ASD but challenges in measuring human fetal exposure to EDCs, and in measuring endogenous metabolism relevant to the health effects of EDCs inhibits studying the relation of EDCs to ASD. Consequently, to enable effective investigation of the role of EDCs as ASD risk factors, comprehensive biomarker-based exposure assessment approaches need to be developed that 1) include highly sensitive measurement of internal dose and 2) incorporate measures of endogenous metabolism as well as early indicators of biologic response. This proposal will overcome these challenges in exposure science and develop the independent research career of a young investigator focused on environmental health sciences in these three specific aims; Specific Aim 1. Quantify internal dose of prototypical EDC exposures (BPA, methylparaben, bis (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, and vinclozolin) in controlled exposures in mice and human variable population exposures using developmentally relevant blood, urine, placenta, meconium and fetal tissue. Specific Aim 2. Elucidate the influence of endogenous metabolic mediators of EDC exposure (sex hormones and folates) on a known biologically relevant exposure response (DNA methylation) during critical neurodevelopmental windows in EDC exposed mice and humans. Specific Aim 3. Identify additional Candidate biomarkers of biological response to EDC exposure."
"9237262","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Closed-Loop Control Modalities in Type 1 Diabetes: Efficacy and System Acceptance In 2009 we initiated one of the first NIH studies dedicated to engineering and clinical testing of closed-loop control (CLC) of type 1 diabetes. Since then, we have achieved key milestones and derived conclusions which enabled further research in this rapidly growing field. Notably, we proposed the idea that the artificial pancreas is not a single all-in-one device but a network encompassing the patient in a digital treatment ecosystem that can offer and alter different treatment modalities in real time depending on the patient's clinical state. This new notion was reflected in: (1) Our modular engineering design of CLC algorithms, which now allows various treatment modalities to be initiated and swapped without interruption; (2) The Diabetes Assistant (DiAs) - the first portable CLC hub using a smart phone to run control algorithms and specifically designed to be operated by the patient, which is now used in a number of outpatient studies in the U.S. and in Europe, and (3)    The Unified Safety System (USS Virginia) - the first CLC algorithm engineered to adapt its mode of operation during the course of every night, first mitigating after-dinner hyperglycemia and then sliding the patient to a target morning glucose of 120mg/dl, thereby resetting his/her metabolic state for a new day. Using these technologies, we now propose to compare in a randomized cross-over trial the long-term efficacy of three treatment modalities - sensor-augmented pump (SAP) vs. USS+SAP during the day(d) vs. USS+CLC(d). We plan to randomize 84 patients with type 1 diabetes into two different treatment sequences: SAP,USS+SAP(d),USS+CLC(d),USS+SAP(d) and USS+SAP(d),USS+CLC(d),USS+SAP(d),SAP. Each treatment modality will continue for 2 months - sufficient time to address the following specific aims: SA1: Overnight CLC achieved by USS+SAP(d) will be superior to SAP alone in terms of: (1) Improved HbA1c without increasing the risk for hypoglycemia; (2) Reduced incidence and risk for hypoglycemia overnight, and (3) Reduced fear of hypoglycemia and improved diabetes quality of life scores. SA2: CLC during the day achieved by USS+CLC(d) will preserve the benefits of USS+SAP(d) and will be superior to USS+SAP(d) in terms of: (1) Increased time within target range of 70-180mg/dl during the day; (2) Reduced risk for hypoglycemia during and after exercise, and (3) Reduced postprandial glucose variability.    SA3: CLC system acceptance evaluated by focus-group interviews and technology acceptance scores will be: (1) Superior, for USS+SAP(d) compared to SAP alone, i.e. adding USS overnight will increase patients' acceptance of CLC, and (2) Marginally inferior, for USS+CLC(d) compared to USS+SAP(d); i.e. some patients would prefer SAP alone during the day due to perceived increased system complexity. Overall, we expect to establish that a distinct overnight CLC modality (USS Virginia) combined with SAP therapy during the day is a viable precursor to future adaptable therapeutic schemes, achieving glycemic control that is superior to SAP alone and optimal balance between system complexity and perceived benefits."
"9312121","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Appointment non-attendance - or, no shows - is common across health institutions, hindering efficient functioning of healthcare systems and contributing to over $150 billion in annual costs. Further, appointment non-attendance is associated with poorer health outcomes, as patients forgo critical preventative care and fail to receive necessary treatment. Certain populations are more likely to engage in non-attendant behavior, including individuals with low socio-economic status and limited English proficiency. As these populations already experience health disparities, they have the greatest need for tools that can effectively help them address the environmental and personal barriers that hinder their ability to keep healthcare appointments. In light of these challenges, the current proposal outlines the development and evaluation of a comprehensive solution to address the numerous personal and environmental factors contributing to no-show behavior. By embedding evidence-based behavior change techniques within a social support structure, the system will deliver targeted, culturally appropriate message campaigns across interactive voice response (IVR), SMS/text message, and email modalities. The messages will offer educational information specific to the nature of the appointment, connection to relevant resources such as affordable local transportation services, and reminders for scheduled visit date, time, and location. Importantly, this system will also be rooted in a peer support network, providing additional personalized assistance to promote adherence and overcome attendance barriers. The resultant system will provide comprehensive support for the range of factors contributing to appointment non-adherence, leveraging external resources and known internal cognitive processes to facilitate patients' increased participation and understanding of their own health care needs."
"9302003","Project Summary/Abstract The objective of the proposed studies is to determine whether a novel anti-inflammatory lignan arctigenin will enhance the chemopreventive effect of green tea (GT) and quercetin (Q) in mouse models, and to identify the underlying mechanisms. GT and its bioactive components GT polyphenols (GTPs) are promising agents in the prevention of prostate cancer. However, the low bioavailability of GTPs limits the success of GT in humans. My previous cell culture and mouse studies demonstrated that the anti-cancer activity of GT can be significantly increased by combination with Q, a natural methylation inhibitor from onions and apples. The combination treatment of Q with GT increases the tissue concentrations of GTPs and decreases the conversion of GTPs to their less bioactive methyl metabolites. Further, we demonstrated in vitro that the combination of very low dose of arctigenin, a novel anti-inflammatory compound mainly from the seed of the herb Arctium lappa, with GT and Q synergistically enhanced the anti-proliferative effect of GT+Q by 2-3 fold in androgen-dependent LNCaP cells. Mechanistic investigations revealed an increase in apoptosis and in inhibition of PI3K/Akt and androgen receptor (AR) pathways by the combination treatment compared to individual compound. A similar pattern in anti-proliferation was also observed in pre-malignant prostate WPE1-NA22 cells with the combination treatment. The proposed project will determine whether this synergistic effect of the combination also occurs in vivo in mouse models. The specific aims include: 1) To determine whether co-treatment of arctigenin with GT and Q will enhance the chemopreventive activity of GT and Q in prostate specific PTEN knockout mice using tumor volume and tumor stage as study endpoints; 2) To validate in vivo the molecular mechanisms responsible for the combined effect of GT, Q and arctigenin with focus on the PI3K/Akt and AR pathways in tumor tissues. The proposed project will make significant contributions to clinical practice by providing a highly effective non-toxic regimen to enhance chemoprevention of prostate cancer at physiologically achievable concentrations of natural compounds. In addition to their direct activity to inhibit carcinogenesis, these natural compounds provide health benefits in prevention and treatment of risk factors of prostate cancer such as obesity and type 2 diabetes."
"9243194","The elderly have the highest tuberculosis (TB) case rate compared to other age groups and are the most susceptible group for TB-associated death. However, we do not yet understand the specific mechanisms by which persistent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) infection impacts the aging immune system or conversely, how aging contributes to the progression of latent M.tb infection to active disease. The goal of the current project is to determine the impact of aging and inflammaging on T cell control of M.tb in mice. Similar to humans, mice become more susceptible to developing primary TB or to reactivation of latent M.tb as they grow older. Thus, the aged mouse model is a good model for understanding basic principles of TB infection and immune control in the elderly. Our preliminary data show an enhanced inflammatory signature in the lung and circulation of old M.tb infected mice, and that senescence-associated immune parameters of T cells are elevated in M.tb infected mice as they age. To fully address both primary infection and reactivation of TB in the elderly, the following Aims will be performed. Aim 1: Determine the impact of inflammaging on susceptibility of old mice to infection with M.tb. Aim 2: Determine the role of senescence mediators on persistent M.tb infection. At the completion of these studies we will have provided mechanistic information on how inflammaging and immune senescence impact M.tb infection. This information is likely to be essential for understanding and managing TB disease in the elderly."
"9232995","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Enteric pathogens cause disease among individuals living in both developing and industrialized countries, with some pathogens being universal, while others are largely restricted to certain settings. Certain enteric pathogens are epidemiologically emerging or re-emerging. Travelers from industrialized countries who visit developing countries form a special risk group that bridges the two broad ecologies. Finally, a few enteric pathogens are of special interest from the civilian biodefense perspective, as they have been used by nefarious individuals to promulgate bioterror (non-typhoidal Salmonella), or have properties that suit them to such a purpose (Shigella dysenteriae 1). The five Projects described in this Enteric Center for Excellence in Translation Research (Enteric CETR) proposal, bonded by the theme Immunoprophylactic Strategy to Control Emerging Enteric Infections, will undertake translational research towards developing products to prevent enteric disease caused by several important bacterial and protozoal pathogens, including: the enteric fever Salmonella serovars S. Typhi, S. Paratyphi A and S. Paratyphi B (Project 1); Clostridium difficile (Project 2); Shigella, enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) and Shiga toxin-producing enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) diarrheal pathogens (Project 3); non-typhoidal Salmonella serovars that cause invasive disease and/or gastroenteritis (emphasizing group C serovars) (Project 4); the protozoan species Cryptosporidium hominis and C. parvum (Project 5). Whereas each pathogen represents an important public health priority, only one, S. Typhi, already has licensed vaccines to prevent disease and those are not ideal. Three projects intend to progress new vaccine candidates to the point where Investigational New Drug Applications (IND) could be prepared to initiate Phase 1 clinical trials. These include: i) a Shigella live vector vaccine expressing protective antigens to prevent clinical  illness caused by several pathotypes of diarrhea-causing Escherichia coli (Project 3); ii) Core-O polysaccharide-flagellin conjugate parenteral vaccines, as well as engineered recombinant attenuated strains, to prevent invasive disease caused by non-typhoidal serovars of Salmonella Group C1 & C2 (Project 4); iii) a vaccine based on proteins from C. hominis and C. parvum sporozoites; iv) a bivalent adjuvanted cTxAB toxoid vaccine to prevent recurrent C. difficile disease (Project 2). We will also investigate a unique passive antibody approach to prevent C. difficile disease (Project 2). Finally, Project 1 aims to explain the cross protection observed in large-scale field trials wherein oral immunization with live S. Typhi vaccine strain Ty21a conferred cross protection against S. Paratyphi B, whereas no protection was afforded against S. Paratyphi A. Most projects will utilize innovative animal models including senescent mouse models (to explore how aging influences immune response to vaccines) and the gnotobiotic piglet model. All projects include collaborations of investigators across multiple institutions of he consortium. The Enteric CETR PL/PD is highly experienced in translational research and vaccine product development."
"9231998","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. Unfortunately, there are still no effective treatments to prevent, halt, or reverse AD. As new clinical trials focus on the initial stages of disease, early diagnosis is now more important than ever.  Human neuroimaging has greatly improved our knowledge of this disease by demonstrating selectively vulnerable large-scale networks whose connectivity declines in AD. Transgenic mouse models of AD have identified specific brain regions whose aberrant excitatory activity causes neuronal network dysfunction. However, the exact relationship between neural network abnormalities in animal models with that in the human condition remains unknown. To better understand the altered neural dynamics underlying clinical symptoms in AD will require novel techniques and methodologies.  Speech and language abnormalities are evident in AD patients from the very early stages of the disease. We propose to use a novel magnetoencephalographic imaging (MEGI) approach to determine the speech- motor-network deficits of AD-spectrum patients. MEGI provides direct recordings of brain activity with precise millisecond resolution. The goal of this study is to understand the spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of speech encoding and speech execution in AD patients. Using customized software we will measure brain activity patterns across high and low frequency bands. We expect to find unique signatures of speech-motor- network dysconnectivity in AD. Such knowledge will be related to underlying synaptic dysfunctions of vulnerable neuronal populations as early biomarkers of the disease and will have important implications for translational research.  The candidate is a physician-scientist with a strong commitment to a career in neurodegenerative dementia research. The candidate has an MD and a PhD in cognition and neuroscience. The research proposal and career development plan build upon her training in rodent neurophysiology and auditory and speech processing to provide expertise in human brain connectivity and its relationship to cognitive deficits in AD. Dr. Keith Vossel, a physician-scientist who cares for patients with dementia and specializes in transgenic mouse models of neurodegenerative disease, is the candidate's sponsor. The mentoring and research experience described in this proposal will facilitate the candidate's goal of developing a strong independent research career."
"9225249","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neural connectivity, the collection of synapses wiring nervous system cells, is a major property of a nervous system, and a determinant of neural function. In humans, billions of neurons make trillions of synapses, and the proper function of this system depends on proper wiring. Incorrect wiring of neurons can lead to improper perception and various neurodevelopmental diseases. While it is generally accepted that the connectivity is determined by cell surface receptors that uniquely label neurons and mechanistically guide their wiring, we know a relatively few number of these receptors. Given the complexity of nervous systems, we need to discover more neural receptors and learn how they function, so as to be able to understand brain development and the physiology of diseases where neural wiring is central. To address this, we are working to reveal the identity and physiological function of cell surface receptors that uniquely label neurons and guide their wiring. Previously, using a biochemical approach (protein interaction screening), we have identified two protein families, Dprs and DIPs in Drosophila, that are determinants of neural connectivity, and are a unique case of an interaction code that likely guides synaptic pairing of neurons in the brain. Members of Dpr and DIP families bind each other not in a simple one-to-one fashion; each Dpr and DIP interacts with many DIPs and Dprs, a phenomenon we call cross-reactivity, and mediates a unique set of interactions. In addition, we have discovered a secreted protein we have named common DIP (cDIP), which binds 21 out of 30 Dprs and DIPs, and likely has a regulatory function on Dpr/DIP-mediated neural connections. Here, we propose to reveal the molecular principles that establish this code, which includes 57 interactions, and study the biology of Dpr/DIP- guided synapse formation in vitro, in culture and in vivo. Our multi-faceted approach includes (1) a biophysical and structural characterization of the Dpr-DIP interactions, followed by engineering of Dprs and DIPs to create novel molecular affinities to be tested for novel neural connectivity in the Drosophila brain; (2) a cellular study of Dpr-DIP mediated adhesions and the effect of the common DIP on these cell adhesions; and (3) the creation of a cell-based system for studying the signaling of Dprs and DIPs via the TGF-?/BMP signaling pathway."
"9230380","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) have immediate effects on exposed individuals, but more complex concerns surround their long term actions on subsequent generations. The limited data from humans concur with the animal work suggesting that exposure to EDCs, particularly exposure during development, produce subtle increases in disease states, along with evidence for transgenerational effects. The precise epigenetic and/or genetic actions of EDCs on specific target genes, which produce stable modifications in subsequent generations, are unknown. The first goal of this program is to understand the mechanisms underlying transgenerational inheritance produced by human-relevant levels of the ubiquitous EDC, Bisphenol A (BPA). The work proposed is the first to test transgenerational actions of human-relevant exposures of BPA on brain and behaviors. Pregnant inbred mice are exposed to EDCs via voluntary ingestion of maternal diet. At birth, control and BPA pups are fostered to dams on control diet to isolate the actions of BPA to gestation and control for any consequences of these compounds on maternal behavior. We have shown that several social behaviors in the first and fourth generation (F4) of mice the BPA lineage differ significantly from control mice. Moreover, mRNA for two genes that regulate social behavior, vasopressin (Avp) and oxytocin (Oxt), are decreased in brains of the F4 BPA-exposed mice. Experiment one will determine the parent of origin for transmission of BPA's actions. In addition we will assess a number of cognitive and emotional behaviors in these mice to improve our ability to predict which human diseases may be sensitive to BPA. In the next study brains regions are probed with next generation sequencing techniques to establish target genes. Brains from F3 mice will be dissected into the nuclei that compose the social behavior network. A combination of Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChiP-) and RNA-sequencing will be conducted. These data provide targets for the epigenetic modifications found in brain. The mechanisms revealed will be applicable to other target tissues and thus a variety of diseases. This research plan will provide the field with a model for transgenerational actions of BPA and an epigenomic map of the consequences of these exposures."
"9348935","SUMMARY Intensive efforts in recent years have been devoted to the discovery of a widely applicable anti-HIV/AIDS vaccine or functional cure. Though these efforts continue, the hope of reaching either goal in the near future seems dim. By contrast, combination antiretroviral therapy has over the past 20 years in large part kept HIV-1 in check from running rampant worldwide. Despite this medical milestone, significant numbers of new infections each year initiate from drug resistant viral strains, and many of the utilized drugs have unwanted side effects. New combinatorial formulations are therefore required to stay ahead of the virus for the foreseeable future. A vast repertoire of largely untapped drug targets stem from the multitude of specific interactions the virus must make with the host cell in order to support its replication. After HIV-1 enters a new cell, the viral RNA genome is converted into a linear DNA molecule by reverse transcription. The resulting preintegration complex, which is composed of the viral DNA as well as viral and host proteins, traffics along microtubules to the cell nucleus, where it is transported into the nucleus in an energy-dependent manner. Once inside, the preintegration complex traffics to active genes, which are the sites of preferential HIV-1 integration. Using a variety of molecular biology, virology, biochemistry, cell biology, and bioinformatic approaches, this basic science grant will discover and characterize virus-host interactions that are critical for the steps of preintegration complex nuclear import and subsequent intranuclear trafficking to the sites of viral DNA integration. Such information will critically inform downstream programs that aim to target these essential steps of the HIV-1 replication cycle for drug discovery."
"9229591","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We are proposing a Community Zebrafish Resource for Modeling GWAS Biology that will exploit existing expertise within our institutions in zebrafish genetics, bioinformatics, zebrafish assay development, genetic modeling and mechanistic studies. These studies will lay the foundation for exploration of the gene networks underlying common human disease phenotypes, and establish high-throughput biology in the zebrafish as a platform to complement GWAS across a broad range of traits. Importantly, this approach is readily adapted to drug response phenotypes and novel traits as they emerge. The Specific Aims are; Aim 1-Initial feasibility assessment and assay development a) Bioinformatics-An initial evaluation of the traits to assess the feasibility of modeling in the zebrafish combined with bioinformatic identification of true orthologs, reagent design and where possible in silico prioritization of candidates. In addition we will specifically explore the relationships between candidate causal SNPs (identified from 1000 genomes data [26, 27]) and the latest tissue-specific ENCODE maps to define the transcription factor networks that may be impacted by the common variants [28, 29]. b) Assay design-We will build representative and quantitative assays for the phenotypes of interest, and anchor these to existing human genotypes and phenotypes using known manipulations of known Mendelian genes regulating the phenotype. Aim 2-Systematic evaluation of candidate genes and non-coding variants across multiple loci-Once the phenotypic assays have been validated, we will test in the zebrafish each of the candidate genes and regulatory sequences (where the orthologs can be identified) for their effects alone and in combination on the primary trait [30]. Quantitative assessments will be generated for loss of function and gain of function alleles, using existing mutants, morpholinos and transient or stable transgenesis. We propose to study approximately 15-20 GWAS loci per year. Aim 3-Establishing zebrafish models for downstream discovery-Once we have established the causal genes underlying each GWAS locus, we will develop stable loss of function (using TALEN or zinc finger nuclease technology) or gain of function alleles for each gene [31 -33]. In addition, where relevant we will generate stable reporter strains for subsequent genetic or chemical screens. These lines will be made freely available to the community to accelerate the translation of completed and ongoing GWAS."
"9408260","PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this proposal is to test whether the biology of glycosphingolipid trafficking can be harnessed for delivery of therapeutic peptides and antigens across tight mucosal barriers in vivo. Currently, there are no effective methods for oral drug delivery across tight mucosal epithelial barriers lining the intestine. Here, we propose studies towards the development of a lipid-based platform for mucosal delivery of therapeutic peptides and antigens exploiting an endogenous glycoshingolipid-based trafficking pathway across polarized epithelial cells. This pathway sorts short- or unsaturated GM1-ceramides across the cell to the basolateral membrane - thus breeching the epithelial barrier by transcytosis. Our aim is to design GM1 carriers that internalize therapeutic cargoes and efficiently cross the intestinal epithelial barrier. We have recently identified GM1 species that are efficiently released from cell membranes after transcytosis and another set of GM1 species that are not efficiently released, but are rather retained on membranes for longer periods. We will expand our proof of principle studies by mucosal administration of the non-native GM1 species fused to the incretin hormone GLP-1, as model for treatment of Type II Diabetes. Further structure-function studies of the extracellular oligosaccharide domain of GM1 and mechanistic studies to enable the technology are also a focus of the current proposal. The GM1 platform would be applicable to the mucosal delivery of a wide range of large and small molecule drugs and therapeutic proteins and peptides- including mucosal antigens for immune system modulation. I will then test if GM1 species can allow for delivery of antigens (modeled by ovalbumin) across mucosal barriers such as enabling induction of immunological tolerance (or mucosal vaccination). I will leverage our unique reagents and research approach, the available resources throughout the Lencer Lab and Longwood Medical Campus, and group of expert scientists we have already assembled to complete the proposed experiments and develop my career as an independent researcher and achieve my goal to make novel contributions to the field of lipid biology and vaccine development."
"9198052","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiac myosin binding protein-C (cMyBP-C) is a heart-specific muscle protein that regulates cardiac structure and function. Mutations in the cMyBP-C gene are a leading cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Previously, we discovered and described a variant in the cMyBP-C gene (MYBPC3) that leads to a change in the C10 domain of the C'-region (cMyBP-C?C10) and is associated with the development of HCM and heart failure (HF). It has been estimated that cMyBP-C?C10 is inherited in ~60 million South Asians, who have a statistically higher risk of heart disease and higher mortality rate after myocardial infarction. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the pathogenicity of cMyBP-C?C10 is unknown. Therefore, our short-term goal is to define the pathogenic mechanism that leads to HCM via this genetic route and develop therapeutic strategies to treat it. Our long-term goal is to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of MYBPC3 mutations in relation to the etiology of HCM to provide a foundation for developing novel therapies. To those ends, the overall objectives are to (1) determine whether cMyBP-C?C10 plays a pathogenic role in the etiology of HCM by using a transgenic mouse model; (2) define whether activation of the protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK) pathway, one of the unfolded protein responses, is the molecular mechanism underlying cMyBP-C?C10 pathogenicity; and (3) determine whether expression of cMyBP-C?C10 further exacerbates ischemia-reperfusion injury and, if so, whether inhibition of the PERK pathway is cardioprotective. Our central hypothesis is that cMyBP-C?C10 causes HCM by inducing the PERK pathway, further aggravating IR injury and increasing morbidity and mortality. To test this hypothesis, a cardiac-specific transgenic mouse model expressing cMyBP-C?C10 in the heart has been established. It will be used to study the disease mechanism and to evaluate potential therapeutic targets. Pilot studies show that transgenic lines with 50% cMyBP-C?C10 expression, compared to endogenous cMyBP-C, show the HCM phenotype by 12 weeks of age, suggesting that cMyBP-C?C10 is sufficient to recapitulate the human HCM disease phenotype. Using these mice, SPECIFIC AIM 1 will precisely determine the pathological consequences of cMyBP-C?C10 on cellular and whole-organ function. SPECIFIC AIM 2 will use pharmacologic and genetic approaches to determine whether inhibition of PERK can prevent and/or rescue the development of the HCM phenotype in cMyBP-C?C10 mice. SPECIFIC AIM 3 will determine whether cMyBP-C?C10 expression is a risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality after IR injury. PERK inhibition will be tested for its ability to rescue the HCM phenotype and reduce the pathogenic consequences of IR injury."
"9259137","Project Summary  Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heritable, heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder that is diagnosed on the basis of impairments in social communication, as well as the presence of repetitive behaviors and restricted interests. Although the disorder has a rising prevalence last estimated at 1 in 68 children, there is still a paucity of broadly effective treatments. This is in part because there is still little known about the underlying neurobiological basis of ASD. Furthermore, the considerable heterogeneity present in ASD makes it difficult to draw conclusions about how the brains of individuals with ASD differ from those of typically developing (TD) persons. This project will take an interdisciplinary approach to improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying ASD and to parse the heterogeneity present in ASD by analyzing how common genetic variants may affect the brain.  This project will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to relate functional and structural connectivity to cumulative genetic risk in 80 children and adolescents with ASD (age 8-16) and 80 matched TD controls (age 8-16). Functional connectivity will be calculated from resting-state functional MRI scans by correlating activity time courses across different brain regions. Structural connectivity will be quantified through diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which measures white matter microstructure based on the directional movement of water molecules. Cumulative genetic risk will be based on participants' genotypes in several common genetic variants across three genes which have been consistently linked to ASD (CNTNAP2, MET, OXTR). This study will also examine whether genetic risk influences the brains of individuals with ASD differently than those of TD controls; for instance, youth with ASD may be more vulnerable to the effect of such risk variants. To better understand the impact of genetic risk and the neural variation related to such vulnerability, genetic risk and associated measures of brain connectivity will be related to individual differences in ASD symptomatology. Lastly, a classifier analysis based on brain connectivity measures will be used to determine how including genetic information may improve the ability to predict diagnosis from brain measures.  By examining how cumulative genetic risk impacts brain connectivity, this research may suggest one potential mechanism through which risk genes contribute to ASD and ultimately lead to more targeted treatments. This approach will also begin to characterize individual variation within ASD, which may eventually aid with the development of more personalized interventions. Lastly, current attempts to diagnose ASD using brain-based measures do not yet have a high enough accuracy for clinical use. Accounting for some of the heterogeneity in ASD may improve prediction abilities and thereby aid with quantitative early diagnosis and subsequent early interventions in younger populations."
"9318873","ABSTRACT Metastatic dissemination is the major cause of death in breast cancer patients. The majority of patients that develop metastatic disease present without clinically detectable metastases which, with the lack of reliable non-invasive methods for detection of early metastatic disease, remains the prevailing hurdle that prevents timely and effective therapeutic intervention in a well-defined patient population. One major player in invasion- metastasis cascade is a population of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) that migrate from bone marrow to visceral organs where they organize and maintain pro-tumorigenic immunosuppressive microenvironment, known as pre-metastatic niche. HSPC is a heterogeneous population of continuously maturing cells, but at least one common marker has been identified as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR-1). Pro-metastatic activity of HSPC can be blocked by a VEGFR1-specific antibody, indicating a critical role that VEGFR-1 plays in initiating metastatic disease. We hypothesize that targeted molecular imaging of VEGFR-1 could provide unique opportunities for detecting and characterizing early metastatic or even pre-metastatic events. Based on our previously published results involving the newly developed VEGFR-1 selective ligand scVR1, we envisage using the 18F- and 89Zr-labeled versions scVR1/F and scVR1/Zr, respectively, in PET imaging studies to gain new insight into the biology of metastatic dissemination. Our first goal within this study will address the evaluation of the target VEGFR-1 in terms of its prevalence and the mechanism involved in the VEGFR-1 mediated tracer uptake in both primary tumor as well as metastatic lesions. To that end, two metastasis models based on the murine breast cancer tumor cell line 4T1 will be utilized: spontaneous dissemination from primary orthotopic 4T1luc breast carcinoma and accelerated metastatic growth initiated by intracardiac injection of 4T1luc cells. VEGFR-1 prevalence will be determined from dose-dependent tracer uptake studies. Our receptor-selective tracer will then allow us to determine the receptor-specific uptake. Subsequent pretargeting experiments using in vivo click-chemistry will be used to distinguish between receptor-binding and receptor-mediated internalization mechanisms of tracer uptake. The second part of this study endeavors to answer the question, whether non-invasive imaging of VEGFR-1 allows for the detection of early metastasis. For that, we will utilize a specifically engineered 4T1luc/V model with enhanced expression levels of VEGF in combination with longitudinal PET imaging to label VEGFR-1-positive HSPC in vivo, at early stages of the invasion?metastasis cascade, prior to establishing of metastatic lesions. This new imaging approach would be instrumental in elucidating the role of VEGFR-1 positive cells in the onset and development of metastatic dissemination."
"9386221","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroscientists and physicians continue to struggle to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie mental illness, and even more so to translate this information into the personalized therapies needed for diseases. Although research over the past five decades has uncovered genes, gene variants, molecular networks, cellular interactions and brain pathways supporting brain disorders, our translation of this information remains limited. A new generation of neuroscientists is needed that understand, and can exploit, 1) the functional impact of genetic and epigenetic variation in vivo, 2) the developmental and regulatory context within which genes produce alterations in synaptic physiology, 3) the circuit-level pathologies that lead to changes in behavior and 4) the best practices in translating research findings into novel therapies. We propose The Vanderbilt Postdoctoral Training Program in Functional Neurogenomics as a vehicle to insure a merger of disciplines, where trainees gain experience in the opportunities afforded by genetic model systems, gain expertise in the translation of human genetic findings into construct-valid animal models, learn to manipulate molecules, cells and circuits with advanced approaches in vivo, and gain experience in capturing the physiological and behavioral consequences of such manipulations. We build our program on a significant investment over the past two decades by Vanderbilt in neuroscience faculty, educational programs, technological expertise and core facilities. Our Program Director is Randy D. Blakely, Ph.D., an NIMH MERIT awardee and Director of the Vanderbilt Silvio O. Conte Center for Neuroscience Research. Dr. Blakely's research ranges from forward and reverse genetic studies in C. elegans to the modeling of mental illness-associated gene variation in transgenic mice, to the identification of functional human genetic variation underlying autism and ADHD. Two established neuroscientists with a long-standing interest in advancing the careers of junior scientists oversee the Program. The Program Co-Director is Roger D. Cone, Ph.D., Chair of the Department of Molecular Physiology & Biophysics at Vanderbilt, and an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences. Dr. Cone's research incorporates the tools of modern genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry and behavior, with a focus on CNS control of appetite and eating disorders. Similar to Dr. Blakely, the paradigms used in Dr. Cone's research ranges across powerful genetic model systems, including transgenic zebrafish and mice, to research probing for functional gene variation underlying eating disorders. Like Dr. Blakely, Dr. Cone has trained dozens of predoctoral and postdoctoral fellows, bringing significant mentorship experience to the Program."

"9245727","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2). Symptoms of RTT include mental disability, autistic behavior, and seizures. In addition, severe respiratory dysfunction contributes significantly to poor quality of life and is associated with high mortality rate in this population. Evidence from RTT mouse models suggest that disordered breathing in RTT may result from disruption of central chemoreceptors (neurons that regulate breathing in response to CO2/H+), yet the cellular and molecular basis of MeCP2-dependent control of breathing remains largely unknown. MeCP2 is highly expressed throughout the nervous system and recent evidence shows that loss of MeCP2 from astrocytes contributes to symptoms of RTT including disordered breathing. Astrocytes in a brainstem region called the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) are known to control breathing by sensing CO2/H+ by inhibition of inward rectifying K+ channels (Kir4.1) and releasing ATP to stimulate nearby chemosensitive neurons. Preliminary data presented here demonstrates Kir4.1 expression is significantly decreased in multiple brain regions in MeCP2 deficient mice, suggesting expression of this channel is regulated by MeCP2. Therefore, we hypothesize that MeCP2 is required for expression of Kir4.1 in RTN astrocytes and loss of MeCP2 from astrocytes disrupts RTN chemoreceptor function and contributes to disordered breathing in RTT. In this proposal, we use an established mouse model of RTT and the newly developed inducible astrocyte specific Kir4.1 knockouts in conjunction with molecular, genetics, slice electrophysiology, and whole-animal plethysmography to determine if MeCP2 and Kir4.1 in astrocytes are essential for control of breathing. The three Specific Aims of this project are: 1) determine whether MeCP2 is required for expression of Kir4.1 in RTN astrocytes; 2) determine if loss of MeCP2 affects excitability chemosensitive RTN neurons; 3) determine the essential roles of Kir4.1 in RTN astrocytes for control of breathing. By understanding contributions of MeCP2 and Kir4.1 in astrocytes to RTN physiology in vitro and in vivo, we will provide insight into the cellular and molecular basis of disordered breathing in RTT and in doing so create new avenues for treatment of life-threatening symptoms of this disease."
"9324688","Project Summary/Abstract We aim to develop probe compounds to validate 15-prostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) as a novel drug target for accelerating recovery from hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HST). HST, including bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is a curative treatment for hematological malignancies including leukemias, lymphomas, myelodysplasias, and multiple myeloma. However, recovery from HST is slow, requiring extended hospitalization. Patients are at high risk of infections resulting from low white blood cell counts, bleeding resulting from low platelet count, and are anemic, resulting from low red blood cell counts. Our broad objective is to develop small molecule inhibitors of 15-PGDH to test the hypothesis that these inhibitors will elevate tissue levels of prostaglandin E2 in vivo, and thereby accelerate recovery of white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets following HST. Moreover, we seek to validate 15-PGDH as a novel target for the treatment chemotherapy induced gastrointestinal enterocolitis, a severe side effect of HST conditioning. Importantly, no current treatments exist for drug-induced enterocolitis or for accelerating recovery following HST.  In a recent article in Science, we described the first in vivo active inhibitor of 15-PGDH. This enzyme metabolizes PGE2 to its biologically inactive form, 15-keto-PGE2. The small molecule SW033291 inhibits 15- PGDH with Ki<1 nM. In vivo, SW033291 doubles PGE2 levels in the bone marrow and colon. Through this effect, SW033291 accelerates hematopoietic recovery after bone marrow transplantation in mice. It speeds the return of neutrophils, platelets and erythrocytes by 6 days. Moreover, SW033291 protected the colon and intestinal mucosa of mice that had been treated with either DSS or the chemotherapeutic 5-FU. By speeding bone marrow recovery and preventing enterocolitis, inhibitors of 15-PGDH have promise to markedly reduce i) infection and bleeding complications, and ii) their associated mortality and morbidity in human hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.  Aim 1 focuses on medicinal chemistry. SW033291 suffers from low aqueous solubility, high lipophilicity, and functionality that could generate reactive metabolites. A second generation inhibitor substantially improves the polarity and solubility profile, but displays a short in vivo half-life and a modest hERG signal. In Aims 2 and 3, we will confirm that our inhibitors engage 15-PGDH and will optimize treatment duration to promote recovery of blood cells and block enterocolitis. We will also compare the effectiveness of inhibition of 15-PGDH versus the current standard of care G-CSF, for which we have already demonstrated at least an additive effect. We will additionally compare the effectiveness of 15-PGDH inhibition verses a competing technology. Finally, in aim 4 we will test our optimized inhibitors in rigorous preclinical models of efficacy and safety. Broadly, our goals are to 1) validate a new target for accelerating recovery from hematopoietic stem cell transplant, and 2) provide safe, potent and selective inhibitors of 15-PGDH as validated drug leads."
"9307311","Project Abstract High adiposity at birth is associated with poor metabolic outcomes and increased risk of obesity in childhood and adult life. Maternal obesity (body mass index >30 kg/m2) is associated with increased fetal adiposity, but not all obese women have obese babies. Maternal insulin sensitivity is a key predictor of fetal fat accrual, but the mechanisms regulating insulin signaling during pregnancy are unknown. We have found that maternal insulin sensitivity improves 120% following delivery of the placenta, suggesting a placental factor may regulate insulin signaling during pregnancy. As placental growth and gene expression is sensitive to maternal insulin levels in early pregnancy, and correlated to adiposity at birth, we propose that maternal-placental crosstalk is key to fetal growth regulation. Placental-derived microRNAs (miRNA) regulate post-transcriptional gene expression in maternal tissues, and are detectable in maternal plasma throughout pregnancy. Thus, miRNAs may provide both a mechanism for maternal-placental crosstalk, and novel indicators of women at risk of high fetal fat accretion. The overall goal of this study is to utilize two well-phenotyped, racially-diverse birth cohorts to identify placental miRNA expression profiles associated with alterations in maternal insulin resistance throughout pregnancy resulting in high neonatal adiposity. We hypothesize that placentas of high adiposity infants have a distinctive miRNA expression profile affecting maternal insulin signaling, resulting in high maternal insulin resistance. To test this hypothesis, we will utilize pre-collected samples from two birth cohorts. The first cohort will consist of four groups: lean and obese women who delivered high or low adiposity offspring. These women all had healthy pregnancies, were not diabetic, and recruited at time of scheduled cesarean section where maternal blood, insulin sensitivity data and placental tissue were collected. In a second cohort, maternal blood and insulin sensitivity were measured in early and late pregnancy and placental tissue was collected at term. In both cohorts, neonatal adiposity was measured. The term cohort will be used to identify placental miRNAs associated with high neonatal adiposity, and the longitudinal cohort will be used to validate these miRNA throughout pregnancy. Upon completion of the proposed studies we will have determined: 1) the identity of miRNAs that are associated with high neonatal adiposity in placentas of lean and obese women; 2) the presence of these placenta-derived miRNAs in maternal plasma in early and late pregnancy; 3) the effect of placenta-derived miRNAs on insulin signaling pathways in skeletal muscle in vitro. Identification of markers of altered placental function affecting neonatal adiposity, detectable non-invasively in early pregnancy, will improve our screening for pregnancies at risk of excessive fetal fat accretion and may lead to specific therapies based on the underlying physiology."
"9415230","Tumor hypoxia is an important characteristic of solid tumors and a modulator of therapeutic response. Because oxygen diffuses 100-150 ?m from blood vessels, fast growing tumors often have two hypoxic regions: a chronically hypoxic region in the center of the tumor and a cycling (or acute) hypoxic region within the diffusion distance. Numerous studies have found that hypoxia, especially its temporal fluctuation, leads to enhanced tumor metastasis and resistance to radiation and drugs. Strategies to reduce hypoxia by increasing delivery of oxygen and decreasing oxygen consumption within the tumor are both being explored to overcome hypoxia-induced resistance to radiation and drugs. Therefore, there is growing demand for technologies that noninvasively measure tumor oxygenation temporally in vivo to enable advances in drug screening, development and optimization. However, the relative contributions of chronic hypoxia and cycling hypoxia (CH) as well as the therapeutic responses are difficult to determine primarily due to the lack of a noninvasive tool to continuously quantify the temporal profile of tumor hypoxia in vivo. We have recently developed a side-firing fiber optic sensor and a 1st generation (GEN-1) frequency-domain near-infrared spectroscopy (FD-NIRS) for quantification of tissue oxygenation and total hemoglobin content in model tumors. The flat sensor can be easily and reliably attached to a tumor surface and thus is an ideal tool for longitudinal monitoring of rodent tumor models and studying anti- hypoxia drugs in vivo. The objective of the proposed project is to develop a 2nd generation (GEN-2) FD-NIRS instrument with improved speed and throughputs and validate it for longitudinal assessment of tumor hypoxia and the efficacy of chemoradiotherapy. We hypothesize that 1) the temporal profiles of hypoxia vary in different breast tumors and 2) biguanide drugs (e.g., metformin or phenformin) can reduce the oxygen consumption of breast cancer cells, thus improving their radiosensitivity. The following specific aims will be conducted to test the hypotheses: (1) to construct a 2nd generation FD-NIRS instrument with 10x speed and 15-dB better throughputs; (2) to quantify the characteristics of tumor hypoxia in orthotopic models of breast cancer; and (3) to assess the efficacy of metformin and irradiation in orthotopic models of breast cancer using the GEN-2 device. Our long-term goal is to develop a portable/wearable, low-cost FD-NIRS device that can aid in development and optimization of anti-hypoxia drugs and chemoradiotherapy. The successful completion of the aims will not only generate new knowledge about tumor hypoxia and lay the foundation for subsequent clinical studies to further delineate the role of hypoxia in cancer therapy, but also will enhance the biophotonics research and education at Marquette University."
"9307156","Project Summary Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most prevalent hematological cancer in children younger than 14 years of age. Although disease relapse is the leading cause of cancer-related death in pediatric cancer patients, little progress has been made in the treatment of leukemia relapse or in reducing the incidence of relapse by increasing the cure rates of frontline therapy. The prognosis of children with second and third marrow relapse is poor with complete remission rates of 44% and 27% respectively. Thus, the development of targeted therapies in T-ALL is a clear priority in pediatric oncology. A poor understanding of the mechanism by which leukemia-initiating cells (LIC) drive chemoresistance and relapse has hindered the development of therapies targeting this population. We discovered that Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) is inactivated by gene methylation in T cell ALL (T-ALL) patients and that deletion of the Klf4 gene in mice accelerates the development of NOTCH1-induced T-ALL by promoting LIC expansion. As a transcriptional repressor, loss of KLF4 augments the expression of the dual specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase 7 (Map2k7) and consequently activates JNK and downstream ATF2 and c-Jun. In sharp contrast to wild-type T-ALL mice and healthy children, we discovered elevated protein levels in the total and phosphorylated Map2k7, and downstream activation of the JNK pathway, both in KLF4-deficient murine T-ALL and pediatric T-ALL patients. Thus, the loss of KLF4 in mouse is an ideal model with which to study the inhibition of the Map2k7 pathway aberrantly activated in human T-ALL. Based on our strong preliminary data our central hypothesis is that inactivation of KLF4 in T-ALL patients augments Jnk-dependent expansion of LIC by increasing the levels of Map2k7 and that pharmacological inhibition of this pathway can ameliorate disease progression and potentially eradicate disease. In order to prove this hypothesis, we will conduct three specific aims: (Aim 1) Investigate KLF4 regulation of the Map2k7 pathway using the genetic mouse model of NOTCH1-induced T-ALL and patient samples to validate Map2k7 for LIC-targeted therapy; (Aim 2) Study the molecular mechanism underlying regulation of LIC self-renewal and the downstream amino acid response mechanism driving chemoresistance; (Aim 3) Study the anti-leukemic properties of Map2k7 and JNK inhibition as single agents and in combination with standard chemodrugs in pre-clinical models using the genetic mouse model and patient-derived xenografts of pediatric T-ALL. Our studies are likely to have a large overall impact on the field of leukemia because they will fundamentally advance our mechanistic understanding of leukemogenesis and LIC self-renewal and chemoresistance. Thus, this study will contribute to the eradication of this deadly disease in children and adolescents by defining the mechanisms required for the maintenance of LICs during T-ALL progression and evaluating new therapeutic approaches. In addition, the results of this study will likely have broader applications in other types of pediatric and adult leukemia that are refractory to therapy."
"9259667","Abstract:  Using a mouse model of hepatitis B virus (HBV), the goals of this proposal are to determine: 1) how group 3 innate lymphocytes (ILC3s) contribute to HBV disease pathogenesis and 2) whether age plays a role in ILC3 function during an HBV immune response. The first portion of this proposal focuses on studying how HBV pathogenesis is affected by ILC3-deficiency through monitoring serological markers of HBV clearance and persistence, measuring the strength and diversity of effector T cell responses, evaluating the extent and quality of B cell responses and assessing lymphoid organization in the liver. The role of specific ILC3-derived cytokines will also be investigated by blocking their signaling during HBV-induced immunity to determine which ILC3 effector molecules contribute to ILC3 function in the liver. The second part of this proposal focuses on quantifying and qualifying age-dependent differences in hepatic ILC3s in an effort to better understand how age directs human HBV pathogenesis. This will be accomplished by measuring the expression of key cytokines and surface molecules in liver ILC3s over time during the initiation of an immune response to HBV in adult and young mice, as well as investigating the impact that ILC3 stimulation has on HBV pathogenesis in an age-dependent manner. Finally, age-dependent patterns of ILC3s identified in the mouse model will be compared to adult and infant human liver biopsies to determine the relevance of these findings in humans.  Information gathered from this proposal will represent significant progress towards understanding how immunity is orchestrated in the liver. It is clear that the liver employs unique strategies for determining self versus non-self due to the constant influx of non-self antigens from commensal organisms in the intestines, particularly at an early age when the GI tract is undergoing microbial colonization. Hepatitis B virus research shows that while the immune response in adults is often effective in controlling HBV infection, infants' and young children's immune responses in the liver are ineffective at clearing the virus, often leading to persistent infection. Thus, it is critical that we characterize age-dependent differences within the liver that direct effective versus ineffective immunity so that we can identify better therapeutic targets for the millions of patients living with chronic HBV. Defining the role of ILC3s in HBV pathogenesis is one step toward this goal and is essential for a comprehensive understanding of hepatic immunity. These studies will also garner insight on the greater role of ILC3s during infection and provide clues as to why these cells are most important in tissues that experience high microbial exposure."

It has also described 50-year temporal trends in stroke risk, and crafted a widely used Framingham Stroke Risk Profile (FSRP). In parallel, FHS has prospectively accrued data on incident mild cognitive impairment and dementia, 1-3 rounds of brain MRI and detailed cognitive assessment (N~7000 persons) and a wealth of genomic, lifestyle, vascular risk factor and biomarker data. In this renewal we propose to continue stroke surveillance, to identify additional stroke risk factors and temporal trends, especially in adults <55 years, and to use the rich data available in FHS to understand vascular contributions to dementia.  The burden of stroke is dwarfed by the burden of subclinical vascular brain injury (VBI). VBI assessed with objective imaging measures, is a risk factor for stroke and for vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). However, there is considerable heterogeneity in the association between conventional MRI measures of VBI and cognitive performance. We hypothesize that some of this discrepancy will be due to differences in brain blood flow (imaged with pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling [pCASL]), white matter integrity (detectable by diffusion tensor imaging [DTI]), functional connectivity (assessed by fcMRI) and concomitant AD pathology (assessed using PIB-PET amyloid burden). We also posit that variability in risk of VCID might be further explained by exploring individual differences in genetic susceptibility, lifestyle and exposure to risk factors. Finally, we postulate that factors determining VCID in persons with and without stroke will overlap.  We propose the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: To continue surveillance for stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) in surviving FHS participants (n~8000, aged 28-107 years), using existing standardized protocols and introducing web-based physician examinations. We will further explore clinical, risk factor, biomarker and (in conjunction with large consortia) genetic risk factors associated with stroke allowing us to expand and refine the FSRP. We propose to especially focus on young stroke and the study of TIA with diffusion-weighted abnormalities. Aim 2: To examine the burden of VBI after stroke/TIA using 3TMRI, MRA, pCASL, fcMRI and PIB-PET at 6 months and 2 years after the event in 75 cases, and in 75 age- and sex-matched controls. We will relate these measures to VCID assessed with a 60 min detailed cognitive assessment, repeatedly used in prior FHS exams. Aim 3: To assess the range of VBI and VCI in 200 persons without clinical stroke, selecting 100 each from the two extremes of the stroke risk (FSRP) spectrum, using the same imaging and cognitive measures as in Aim 2. Aim 4: To identify genetic, lifestyle, vascular and biomarker determinants of VBI, VCI, VCID among FHS participants, utilizing traditional and novel, targeted and exploratory statistical modeling."

"9446138","ABSTRACT The University of Arizona (UA) High School Student NeuroResearch Program (HSNRP) introduces, trains, and nurtures a growing pipeline of diverse talented Arizona high school students, expanded by select progressing undergraduates, including a majority of underrepresented disadvantaged minorities in basic, translational, and clinical research on the normal and abnormal nervous system, neurological disorders, and stroke, and also encourages pursuit of advanced research experiences and fulfilling health/medical/science-related careers. We are leveraging the strong infrastructure, effective recruitment strategies, high level of student/faculty mentor participation, esprit-de-corps, and outstanding trainee productivity of our long-standing federally funded multidisciplinary/multispecialty disadvantaged high school student, undergraduate, and medical student summer research programs and year-round enrichment activities to energize the training model for this specialized NeuroResearch (NR) program. Fourteen-16 full-time 8-12 week summer high school and 4-6 undergraduate trainees annually for the next 5 years will be offered an expanding menu of closely mentored NR experiences; for retention in the pipeline, select HSNRP trainees will be subsequently reappointed for more advanced NR. Interacting together, these trainees will be integrated into an innovative, internationally recognized inquiry-based Summer Institute on Medical Ignorance (SIMI) which interweaves biomedical Knowns and Unknowns (what we know we don't know, don't know we don't know, and think we know but don't) with featured NR topics and mentor stories and sustains the momentum by periodic enrichment activities year-round. SIMI emphasizes translating translation and scientific questioning and includes a brief Introduction to Pathobiology and the language of medicine, topical seminars, laboratory/leadership/ multimedia skill workshops and practicums, clinical correlations, social networking, and career advising. A unique Virtual Clinical Research Center/Questionarium forms a mobile phone accessible-centerpiece platform for training and national/international networking. Within basic and clinical departments and specialized Centers of Excellence with enhanced Neuroscience emphasis and overseen by an energetic experienced multidiscplinary HSNRP Leadership Team and Advisory Committee, student research will encompass cross-cutting themes and in vivo, in vitro, in situ, in silico, and modeling approaches to neurobiology/disorders including Parkinson, Alzheimer, Niemann-Pick C diseases, ALS, epilepsy, HIV encephalopathy, head trauma, hydrocephalus, muscular dystrophy, pain/addiction pharmacology, molecular psychiatry, cognition, brain development, brain mapping, senescence, mental retardation, blood-brain barrier/neuroprotection, neuroimaging, neuro-genomics/proteomics, neuroengineering, deep brain stimulation, brain tumors, cerebrovascular disease, stroke, neurohealth disparities, and rehabilitation. Based on our ~29-year track record and established access to large diverse pools of disadvantaged Arizona students reflected in 615 SIMI-trained high school students followed to date with many in the basic/clinical NeuroResearch (undergraduate/graduate/ professional degree/biomedical-health career) pipeline, we expect HSNRP to continue to cultivate an expanding network of diverse and curious researchers, physicians and other health professionals; contribute to the NeuroResearch pipeline and enterprise; and improve neurohealth literacy through community engagement. Ongoing short-term and long-term evaluation includes surveys, database registry, curiosity scales, short- and long-term followup, and career portfolios to document efficacy and sustainability of the training model, promote diversity, and national/international networking."
"9231483","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) is the leading cause of hospitalization in older adults. Multiple re-hospitalizations, many of which are preventable, are common in HF and contribute substantially to the cumulative burden of illness and cost of care. The rate of HF re-hospitalization is higher in African-American than in white patients, for reasons that are poorly understood. Current HF readmission risk prediction models are inadequate, and re-hospitalization prevention efforts are ineffective. Research is needed on novel risk factors for HF re-hospitalization. Depression is one of the best candidates for further investigation. It is a prevalent comorbidity in HF, and preliminary evidence suggests that it may increase the rate of re-hospitalization. In addition, the progression of HF and multiple re-hospitalizations may contribute to the persistence or worsening of depression. Thus, there may be a reciprocal relationship between depression and multiple re-hospitalizations. This study will be the first to investigate both sides of this relationship, and to examine the impact of depression on the long-term risk of multiple re-hospitalizations instead of focusing more narrowly on the short-term risk of the first re-hospitalization. The primary aim is to test the hypothesis that depression is an independent predictor of recurrent hospitalizations and mortality in patients with heart failure. The secondary aim is to test the hypothesis that multiple hospitalizations predict persistent or worsening depression in patients with HF. Additional aims include investigating whether depression helps to explain the disproportionately high rate of HF re-hospitalizations in African-American patients, and identifying mediators of the relationship between depression and re-hospitalization. A cohort of 400 adult patients (200 African-American, 200 white) with HF will be enrolled in the study and followed for 2 years after their index hospitalization at a large, urban teaching hospital in St. Louis. At enrollment, a structured interview to diagnose DSM-5 depressive disorders will be administered along with questionnaires to assess the severity of depression, anxiety, perceived stress, social support, HF self-care, and HF-related functional impairment. Data on prior HF hospitalizations, HF severity measures, comorbidities, and medications will be extracted from the electronic medical record (EMR) system. The depression questionnaire will be repeated every 3 months for 2 years. Hospitalizations and deaths will be ascertained by queries of the hospital's EMR system, interviews with the participants and collateral informants, medical records of admissions to other facilities, and the National Death Index. State-of-the-art methods for modeling recurrent events data will be used to analyze the time-dependent effect of depression on the rate of re-hospitalization and to determine whether it has more severe effects in African-American than in white patients. A linear mixed model will be used to evaluate the impact of multiple re-hospitalizations on the longitudinal course of depression. The findings will clarify the relationshp between depression and re-hospitalization in patients with heart failure, and help to identify novel targets for intervention."
"9292348","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this proposal is to determine the molecular signals for plasticity in central nervous system that change the reflex control of breathing during chronic hypoxia. This research is significant because it addresses a fundamental but unanswered question in pulmonary medicine: Do changes in the control of breathing occur with chronic hypoxemia from lung disease and, if so, are there individual differences and how do they affect the progression of disease? We have developed methods to study the basic problem at the molecular level in conscious behaving laboratory rodent models, and results from these experiments have produced hypotheses that we have been able to test in humans. Specifically, we have shown that the common anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen blocks time dependent increases in ventilation and ventilatory sensitivity to oxygen during chronic hypoxia in rodents and in healthy humans. This poses exciting new questions about the role of inflammatory signals for healthy and normal plasticity in the chemoreflex control of breathing. For example, inflammation is necessary for ventilatory acclimatization to hypoxia, which is beneficial by increasing O2 supply when O2 availability is decreased for long periods of time, but inflammation with bacterial infection can decrease ventilation and O2 supply, which exacerbates conditions. Also, we have preliminary data showing the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor-1? (HIF-1?) is necessary in brainstem respiratory centers for normal ventilatory acclimatization to hypoxia in transgenic mice. Here we propose to test the hypothesis that both inflammatory signals and HIF-1? are necessary for plasticity in the control of breathing with chronic sustained hypoxia. In three specific aims, we will test the hypotheses that chemoreflex plasticity with chronic hypoxia requires (1) activation of NF-?B and HIF-1? in brainstem respiratory centers, (2) carotid body chemoreceptor afferent activation of microglia followed by astroglia activation that sustains an inflammatory and HIF-1? response, and (3) other isoforms of HIF in the brainstem are not necessary because reactive oxygen species (ROS) are not changing there with chronic hypoxia, although HIF-2? can affect the stability of breathing. Answering such questions could be important for common clinical scenarios where hypoxia and inflammation occur together, for example in COPD exacerbations or weaning from mechanical ventilation after sepsis in the ICU."
"9231375","Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have great potential to counter biological warfare agents that are not addressed by currently available countermeasures. mAbs display exquisite specificity, are able to recruit host immune components to fight infection, confer near-immediate immunity once administered, can be successfully administered to all populations regardless of current immune status, and have a generally low rate of adverse reactions. The Industrialization Core's main responsibility will be to lead the translational research effort for the Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Immunotherapeutic Consortium (VHF-IC). The members of the Core have extensive experience with translating mAb research concepts into IND-enabling preclinical therapeutics for infectious diseases. The Core will make use of a rapid antibody manufacturing platform (RAMP) to provide well characterized, highly purified homogenous mAb preparations to facilitate direct comparisons between different mAbs by the individual Research Projects and Cores C and D. The Industrialization Core will be responsible for management of the advancement of products generated by the Research Projects through IND-enabling studies. In Specific Aim 1, to quickly and economically address the supply needs for the Research Projects and Structure and Virology Cores, the Industrialization Core will produce all ofthe VHF-IC mAbs using the RAMP Nicotiana benthamlana manufacturing system. The Industrialization Core will ensure that all Research Projects and Cores C and D are using well-characterized mAbs with homogenous mammalian N-glycoforms that are produced and purified using a single protocol. In Specific Aim 2, the Industrialization Core will be responsible for advancing the lead products selected from the three Research Projects by the Product Development Team through preclinical development.The Product Development Team will be responsible for prioritizing products and allocating Core resources appropriately and will work closely with the sponsoring companies (Mapp/Defyrus for filovirus products; Zaigen for arenavirus products) who will ultimately be responsible for developing the products after completion ofthe VHF-IC effort."
"9214342","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): New treatments for people with intellectual disabilities (ID) are increasingly condition-specific in nature. Numerous clinical trials of targeted pharmacological agents are now in process for fragile X syndrome (FXS) and Down syndrome (DS). Condition-specific behavioral treatments also are emerging. Evaluation of all such treatments is being hampered by a lack of adequate cognitive and behavioral endpoints. In this project, we propose to evaluate the adequacy of expressive language sampling for deriving language-relevant clinical endpoints. In this procedure, expressive language samples are collected in highly structured and scripted, yet naturalistic, interactions. These samples can then be analyzed to derive clinical endpoints reflecting important dimensions of language skill and atypical language behavior. Although the suitability of expressive language sampling for clinical trials with FXS or DS (or ID more generally) has yet to be determined, the procedures are especially promising because they yield clinically relevant and functional endpoints, have been shown to capture impairments that are common to ID as well as those specific to FXS or DS, and have been shown to yield robust indicators of developmental change within typical and other language-impaired populations. In this project, we propose: (1) to examine the basic psychometric properties of measures derived from expressive language sampling techniques, including establishing their test-retest reliability, internal consistency, validity, and sensitiviy; (2) to evaluate differences in the psychometric properties of expressive language sampling techniques as a function of variations in participant etiology, age, gender, autism symptom severity, and level of ID; (3) to compare the psychometric properties of three different expressive language sampling techniques; and (4) to evaluate the feasibility of implementing the expressive language sampling across multiple sites, as would be required in a typical clinical trial. These aims will be addressed by collecting expressive language samples from children, adolescents, and young adults with FXS or DS. Samples will be collected within three interaction formats: conversation, narration, and the structured interactions comprising the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS). Measures derived from the samples will include those indexing syntax (an area of especially severe impairment in DS) and perseveration (an area of especially severe impairment for FXS). Test-retest reliability will be assessed at 4 weeks (+/- 1 week) using alternate versions of sampling materials. Internal consistency will be assessed by computing alpha coefficients within and across sampling techniques. Standardized tests and informant report will be used as indicators of validity. A two-year longitudinal follow-up will yield an estimate of sensitivity to change. Participants will be tested at multiple sites, each with considerable experience in the evaluation of individuals with FXS or DS. Feasibility of multiple-site implementation will be evaluated by comparing language samples across sites on key indicators. Transcription, coding, and analysis will be conducted only at the UC Davis MIND Institute site."
"9303698","Project Summary/Abstract MOUNT SINAI?S CoFAR CLINICAL RESEARCH UNIT AND CLINICAL TRIAL (THE ?ADVANCE? TRIAL) Food allergy affects up to 8% of children and approximately 5% of adults, is a significant burden on quality of life, is costly, and can be fatal. Significant advances have been made in identifying potential treatment and prevention strategies. Oral (OIT), sublingual (SLIT), and epicutaneous (EPIT) immunotherapy, as well as combination therapy using OIT and omalizumab, and simply having children who are reactive to egg or milk ingest extensively heated forms if they can, have all shown promise to improve treatment. However, limitations of these approaches, including variable efficacy, side effects, costs, and lack of sustained unresponsiveness off treatment frame the need for better therapies. Exciting advances in prevention, specifically the efficacy of early introduction of peanut, have been recently noted. However, more needs to be done to identify the most effective prevention strategies. The objectives of the Consortium for Food Allergy Research (CoFAR) are to conduct ground-breaking trials and studies in treatment and prevention of food allergy, and to incorporate mechanistic studies. The long-term goals of CoFAR are to develop effective strategies to prevent and treat food allergies, and to elucidate underlying immunologic mechanisms. The major objective of the Mount Sinai CoFAR Clinical Research Unit (CRU) is to provide CoFAR with outstanding study opportunities and to propose a clinical trial to achieve the above stated goals. The Mount Sinai CRU team has been successfully and safely conducting food allergy research since 1997. It has contributed to every interventional study described above, and has an extensive portfolio of additional clinical studies. The CRU PI, Scott Sicherer, MD, brings broad experience having been site PI for all of the past CoFAR interventional trials, as well as being Protocol Chair of the CoFAR observational clinical study. He also brings extensive experience from a myriad of areas of food allergy research, including additional treatment trials, registries, diagnostics, and performing quality of life and epidemiologic research and has been a mentor to numerous food allergy investigators. Co-Investigators Drs. Wang and Bunyavanich have served as successful PIs on clinical trials. Two early stage investigators are on the team and will benefit from their involvement to become the next generation of leaders in food allergy research. The Mount Sinai laboratory facilities have been the biomarker core for CoFAR and other multicenter studies and can easily manage biological samples at the direction of the Leadership Center (LC). The Mount Sinai CRU is located in Manhattan, with access to an extensive base of potential participants; it has safely conducted >20,000 oral food challenges and has a superb record of study recruitment and retention. To increase opportunities to contribute to CoFAR?s goals, a clinical trial is proposed using a novel experimental product that combines low dose food allergen with an adjuvant (enhancing a favorable immune response). In summary, the Mount Sinai CoFAR CRU brings extensive resources and experience to ensure that the goals of CoFAR, at the direction of the LC, Steering Committee and NIAID, are met."
"9329147","This application for funding is to support expenses for the 2017 21st Annual Woods Hole Immunoparasitology Meeting (WHIP), which brings together principal investigators, students and postdoctoral fellows from around the world who are in the field of immunoparasitology. The 2017 meeting will be held on April 2-5, 2017. The annual gathering of scholars in this field was established in 1997 with the intent to provide a collegial meeting place for scientists to exchange ideas in this important field. The meeting averages 125 to 150 participants every year. While there are other meetings where senior principal investigators in this field present their data, the focus of this meeting is to provide a forum where graduate students and postdoctoral fellows present their work to each other and established investigators. The meeting also aims to provide the opportunity to highlight new junior faculty in the field. The location was chosen because of the strong association of the Marine Biology Laboratory (MBL) and the field of parasitology. This relationship began more than 30 years ago with the establishment of the annual summer course, ?Biology of Parasitism,? and with the annual Molecular Parasitology meeting held in the fall at the MBL. It is close to laboratories on the east coast, and accessible via direct flights to Boston from around the world. Over 85% of the talks at the WHIP meeting will be given by either graduate students or post-doctoral fellows, making this a unique meeting in the field. In addition to the oral presentations, all of the students and post-doctoral fellows have the opportunity to present their work in poster sessions. Thus, both in oral talks and poster sessions students and post-doctoral fellows in the field of immunoparasitology gain valuable experience in presenting their data, as well as contacts that will be useful for advancing their science and their careers."
"9242896","Project Summary  Isotretinoin is a vitamin A analogue used to treat severe inflammatory, nodular acne in over 13 million people, including children, since its availability in 1982. Isotretinoin causes atrophic changes in the sebaceous gland acini with a marked decrease in sebum production by altering gene expression and promoting inflammatory mediator expression in meibomian gland (MG) epithelial cells. Its teratogenic effects have also led to the implementation of United States Food and Drug Administration's Risk Evaluation Mitigation Strategy program in 2006, called iPLEGDE, which was designed to prevent possible isotretinoin pregnancy exposures in females of child-bearing potential by requiring these patients to incorporate two forms of birth control into their therapy. Hormonal birth control (HBC) containing a combination of estrogen and progesterone is a viable option, since it meets the iPledge requirement and is an effective treatment for some forms of acne. HBC exerts its effect by decreasing androgen production and serum free testosterone levels, which can have profound effects on the sex hormone-regulated MGs. Androgens have been shown to increase lipid metabolism and transport, downregulate genes associated with keratinization of epithelial cells, and suppress pro-inflammatory responses throughout the body, including the eye.  The proposed research aims to elucidate the short- and long-term effects of isotretinoin therapy on the ocular surface in vivo, including the structure and function of MGs. The first aim is to estimate the relative risk and risk factors of having MG atrophy due to previous isotretinoin exposure. This will be achieved through a single-timepoint cohort study by surveying participants about their history of isotretinoin use prior to conducting a complete ocular surface examination. The second aim is to estimate the incidence ratio and attributable risk of MG atrophy due to isotretinoin therapy, incidence rate of MG recovery after treatment, and natural history of MG structure and meibum composition over 18 months. This will be accomplished through a prospective cohort study involving ocular surface examinations and meibum collection at baseline, each month during treatment, and six and 12 months after discontinuing treatment. The study population will consist of three female cohorts (isotretinoin+HBC, HBC only, untreated). A sample of each patient's meibum will be collected at each visit for lipidomic analysis. Given the volume of patients who are treated with isotretinoin annually, the results of this study can influence future therapeutic decisions and dermatological and ophthalmic management plans for isotretinoin patients."
"9256679","PROJECT SUMMARY A connectome is a comprehensive map of the synaptic connections in a neural circuit. Connectomic analysis of a neural circuit provides a foundation for understanding its organization and specific functions. However, constructing a fully-mapped connectome is a difficult task. Technological advances have led to the generation of new tools for connectomic mapping. Serial-section electron micrographs compiled into a 3-dimensional volume produce a digitized piece of tissue full of cell-types and micro-circuits to explore. However, using this approach to ask a targeted question remains challenging. Up to this point, a major barrier in connectomic research was the lack of a dependable, genetic marker for electron microscopy. Finally, we have succeeded in producing this tool. I have held a primary role in the production and validation of an innovative tool enabling targeted connectomic analysis of genetically-specified neurons. Our tool uses cre-lox technology to label targeted cells with robust markers visible at both the light and electron microscopic level. Fluorescent markers revolutionized the study of neural circuits at the light level, and our novel tool brings these same advantages to the ultrastructural level. My pilot data show expected patterns of cell-type-specific labeling at both the light and electron microscopic level, suggesting feasibility of targeted connectomic analysis. Moving forward, my goals are to 1) test the efficacy of this approach in mapping neural circuits and 2) exploit our tool to elucidate the connectivity of intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells (ipRGCs) in the retina and brain. ipRGCs are a specialized class of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) differing from conventional RGCs in both their response properties and axonal terminations. While most RGCs send fast, transient signals encoding image forming features, ipRGCs send slow, sustained signals encoding irradiance, or global light intensity. ipRGC axons terminate in non-image forming regions of the brain where irradiance signals are used to regulate circadian rhythms and pupil dilation. Although the general anatomy and physiology of ipRGCs is well documented, we lack a detailed description of their connectivity. I plan to use our novel tool to conduct a connectomic analysis of ipRGC circuitry. The use of this tool will illuminate the structural connectivity underlying irradiance coding circuits and elucidate the function of the non-canonical ipRGC inputs to the image forming visual pathway. Overall, this proposal will validate our tool for targeted connectomics, prior to its dispersal in the scientific community, and provide valuable insight into the processing and modulation of sensory information through neural circuits."
"9230872","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Only 7% of ischemic stroke events in the US receive thrombolysis (t-PA) therapy due to delayed hospital arrival, most often related to the failure to recognize stroke symptoms and to call 911 immediately. If the current 7% rate of all ischemic stroke patients receiving tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) is increased to only 10%, the realized annual cost savings to taxpayers would be more than $45m. Moreover, it has been estimated that interventions designed to educate patients to seek immediate treatment when a stroke occurs may increase thrombolysis rates to 57%, if emergency medical system response times and in-hospital response times are optimized. The goals of this project are to disseminate a novel, evidence-based stroke preparedness (ability to recognize stroke symptoms and call 911 immediately) behavioral intervention to increase ambulance use for stroke, and to identify contextual influences, including barriers and facilitators that affect adoption, implementation, fidelity and maintenance. The program is being disseminated under the auspices of the New York State (NYS) Department of Health Stroke Center designation program to 47 NYS designated stroke centers for implementation in their local catchment area schools. We will use a Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation Type 3 design that will be informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Stroke Centers will serve as hubs for disseminating and implementing our intervention in their local schools. Our intervention, which we have named Hip Hop Stroke, is a novel school- based, multimedia program targeting 4th through 5th graders that uses a framework of Child-Mediated Health Communication to make children stroke literate and then empower these stroke literate students with the tools required to successfully communicate actionable stroke knowledge (recognition of stroke symptoms and the urgency of calling 911) to their parents and grandparents at home. The effectiveness of Hip Hop Stroke has been established in a recently completed NIH funded study, and our intervention has been cited in major stroke prevention guideline articles. Hip Hop Stroke is well known within the NYS stroke community, has shown high acceptability among NYS schools and, most importantly, helps Stroke Centers fulfill their annual regulatory community stroke education mandates."

To illustrate, the PI has recently identified a novel EPOR/JAK2/STAT5 pathway in which an EPO-induced Spi2A serpin cytoprotects EPCs against executioner cathepsins as leached from ROS-compromised lysosomes [JEM 210:225-32]. And Dr. T. Ganz's laboratory has characterized an EPOR/JAK2/STAT5-induced Erythroferrone TNF cytokine as a hepcidin suppressor [Nat Genet. 46:678-84]. Via major supporting studies for this R01 renewal, we've applied post-translational modification (PTM) based LC-MS/MS proteomics to discover intriguing new mediators of EPO/EPOR/JAK2 action. These include 50+ factors not previously linked to EPO-dependent erythropoiesis within diverse functional categories of molecular adaptors, erythroid cytoskeletal proteins, kinases & phosphatases, and cell cycle & survival factors. SA#1 will extend our PTM-directed proteomic investigations in human erythroid precursor cells to include broad-based targets as modified at pY, T*PP and ubiquitin motifs, together with analyses of more select signaling nodes for S/T kinases, survival/apoptosis factors and cell cycle targets. Networks for hundreds of specifically activated PTM events for novel (and known) EPO targets and transducers will be mined (with collaborating expert bioinformaticists). SA#2 focuses on defining the functional roles and action mechanisms of three interrelated new EPO targets as upstream effectors of EPOR/JAK2 complexes. Two, C1ORF186/RHEX and C1ORF150, are novel molecular adaptors that have evolved as EPO signal transducers in hEPC's (but are absent among mice, rats, lower vertebrates). Third, PTPN18 is a protein tyrosine phosphatase which we demonstrate to increase JAK2 activation, decrease EPOR turnover and limit pY-RHEX formation. Approaches will include GOF, shRNA LOF, and mutant rescue studies in UT7epo cells and primary hEPCs. SA#3 then focuses on a new downstream mediator of EPO action, Thioredoxin-Interacting Protein (TXNIP). EPO modulates TXNIP at C-terminal pT/pS sites, and heightens its expression. TXNIP knockdown attenuates EPC growth, and notably accelerates primary erythroid precursor development to KIT-low, GPA-high hemoglobinizing erythroblasts. Mechanistically how TXNIP acts as a novel EPO agent will be determined by analyzing EPC growth, survival, ROS, miRNA populations and metabolic properties. Overall, studies will reveal important new mediators of EPO-dependent human erythropoiesis. Certain may be druggable with potentials to lessen EPO dosing, and limit EPO's major adverse side effects. Other new EPO targets may functionally relate to MPNs and/or to EPO's potential to worsen cancer outcomes."
"9416700","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inorganic arsenic in water and food are global health problems. Increasing epidemiologic and experimental evidence supports the role of low-moderate inorganic arsenic exposure as a cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor. In the Strong Heart Study (SHS), baseline urine arsenic concentrations were associated with incident CVD, supporting the need to investigate relevant mechanisms for arsenic related CVD, including epigenetic modifications. Objective: To investigate (1) if DNA epigenetic modifications mediate the association between arsenic and CVD and (2) if genetic variability modifies epigenetic mediation of arsenic related CVD in 3,574 SHS participants 45-74 years old and free of CVD at baseline. Preliminary studies: In a pilot study in the SHS, arsenic metabolism, measured by the relative proportion of arsenic species in urine, was associated with global DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation and arsenic exposure was associated with a hypomethylated region of AS3MT, the gene that codes a major methyltransferase involved in arsenic metabolism. In linkage and fine-mapping studies, genetic variants in the AS3MT region of the genome were associated with urine measures of arsenic metabolism. Design and setting: Population-based prospective cohort study of American Indian men and women from Arizona, Oklahoma and North/South Dakota recruited in 1989-1991 and followed through 2008 as part of the SHS. Data collection: Urine arsenic measures (reflecting long-term exposure), DNA samples to measure epigenetic modifications and genetic polymorphisms, CVD follow-up including coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease and carotid plaque, and extensive data characterizing CVD and its risk factors are available. Epigenetic assessment: We will measure genome- wide blood DNA methylation at baseline using state-of-the-art high throughput technology to identify specific DNA methylation that may mediate the relationship between arsenic and incident CVD endpoints and validate the most promising regions using bisulfite pyrosequencing. Genetic assessment: We will measure 96 SNPs previously related to arsenic metabolism and toxicity in the Strong Heart Family Study, conducted in the same communities as the SHS. SNPs in candidate genes related to CVD are already available in the SHS. Statistical analysis: To evaluate if DNA epigenetic modifications mediate the association between arsenic and CVD, the following conditions will need to be met: (1) arsenic is associated with CVD (already confirmed), (2) arsenic is associated with DNA methylation, (3) DNA methylation is associated with CVD, conditional on arsenic exposure, and (4) attenuation of the arsenic-CVD association conditional on DNA methylation. Gene- epigene interactions will be assessed via general linear models and likelihood ratio tests. Significance: By investigating the contribution of arsenic epigenetics to CVD, this study can reveal novel mechanisms for arsenic health effects, identify susceptible populations, and inform risk assessment, with implications for the prevention and control of arsenic exposure in drinking water and food in the US and abroad."
"9335086","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the Seek, Test, Treat, and Retain (STTR) Data Harmonization Coordinating Center (DCC) is to coordinate and support the use of an integrated harmonized data set to test the effectiveness of the STTR paradigm and to improve understanding of the intersection of HIV infection, drug abuse, and the HIV treatment cascade. This will require a DCC experienced in data harmonization, multi-site coordination, and research on drug abuse interventions and impact among persons living with HIV (PLWH) to comprehensively integrate clinical research data from multiple studies. Therefore, we propose the following aims: 1) Provide operational, administrative, and logistical support for the STTR data harmonization initiative 2) Identify and obtain access to STTR data from existing HIV sources. Inclusion of CNICS data has already been approved by the CNICS Executive Committee. 3) Work with a multi-disciplinary team of drug abuse and HIV experts, biostatisticians, epidemiologists, experts from NIDA, and other interested parties to develop and implement a state-of-the-art scientific agenda, including a dissemination and publication plan, that advances the understanding of drug abuse among PLWH, and facilitates studies of drug abuse and testing, engagement, treatment, and retention in care. We are ideally suited to lead the STTR DCC, bringing a background of clinical HIV research including substance use, expertise in biostatistics, epidemiology and project coordination, and vast experience with data harmonization for cohorts and studies of PLWH. We will test and advance emerging methods for integrating, analyzing, and interpreting harmonized large data sets; serve as a centralized resource to facilitate and support research site activities; and conduct cross-site analyses using the STTR integrated dataset. In consultation with NIDA and the study PIs, we will lead a strong research agenda focused on the clinical questions that requires the power of a consortium of studies to successfully elicit answers to generate new knowledge on the intersection of HIV, drug abuse and the HIV treatment cascade to inform future research and clinical care in the US and globally."
"9118370","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Tuberculosis(TB) remains one of major causes of global mortality due to HIV/AIDS and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). Global control of TB is difficult because of the lack of an effective protective vaccine and sterilizing drugs. Since drug resistance likely increases, there i a pressed need to develop new vaccine or immuno- therapeutic. However, there is road-block for vaccine/therapeutic efforts since immune components of anti-TB immunity remain unknown in humans, and in-depth studies are needed to understand how HIV precisely destructs protective mechanisms leading to enhanced TB susceptibility and severity. Our decades-long studies elucidate multi-functional roles for Mtb-specific V?2V?2 T cells, the cell subset existin only in primates. Our new studies provide 1st evidence that dominant V?2V?2 T cells are protective, as they act very fast, traffic to lung within hours and confer anti-TB immunity. In addition, primate CD8+ T cells play a critical role in anti-TB immunity, and CD4+ T cells can function as innate-like cells to control very early TB dissemination while adaptively containing TB progression & sustaining multi-effector functions of CD8+ T and CD3- lymphocytes. We also show that human/macaque Th22 cells can carry membrane-bound IL-22 after de novo production and inhibit intracellular Mtb. Mechanically, rapid pulmonary trafficking/accumulation of vaccine-elicited CD4+/CD8+ Th1 clones appears to be a mechanism underlying T-cell-mediated protection against TB. This principle is supported further by our paralleled studies indicating that IL-2 administration during innate phase of Mtb infection rapidly expands pulmonary CD4+/CD8+ T effectors and confers anti-TB immunity. Furthermore, we showed that co-infection with AIDS virus and mycobacterium reduces the ability of innate/adaptive T cells to traffic/accumulate in the pulmonary compartment leading to enhanced susceptibility to HIV-related TB and reactivation. Notably, our collaborators for this project have exceptional track records of innate-like human CD1b-restricted T cells (22) and human innate immunity including VitD-induced anti-TB immunity, respectively. Our series of novel findings provide strong rationale to investigate immune mechanisms by which innate/adaptive components confer anti-TB immunity in immune competent and HIV-1-infected humans.  We hypothesize that fast-acting innate T-cell populations can rapidly traffic to lung upon Mtb exposure, contain Mtb infection and bridge or synergize VitD-IL-32 innate immunity or adaptive T cells to sterilize Mtb and that HIV infection destructs these protective components. To test this hypothesis, we will recruit crucial human cohorts. Importantly, we will confirm human findings in relevant macaque TB and HIV+TB models. A success of this project will provide new concepts and mechanisms conceiving how the human host mounts sterilizing immunity against Mtb infection and how HIV destructs the sterilizing mechanisms."
"9289422","Abstract:  Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is one of the most difficult challenges in oncology. Activating mutations in the K-ras oncogene are found in 95% of PDA cases, but agents are not yet available that can effectively target this (or any other) high prevalence alteration in PDA. An alternative strategy is to target critical biological processes that PDA cells depend on but normal cells can forego. An example of this is the import of exogenous cysteine (in the oxidized form of cystine) via the cystine/glutamate antiporter called System xc?. The inhibition of System xc? in many cancer cell lines has been shown to induce a peculiar form of non- apoptotic cell death, called ferroptosis, which is mechanistically distinct from necroptosis, autophagy, parthanatos, and other forms of non-apoptotic cell death. It is characterized by the rapid, iron-dependent accumulation of lipid ROS leading to loss of membrane integrity in the absence of DNA cleavage. Despite the dramatic effects of System xc? inhibition in tumor cells, germline System xc? knockout mice are viable and healthy as adults, proving that normal cells do not usually require cystine import. Cysteine is the rate-limiting precursor for the synthesis of glutathione (GSH), a non-protein tripeptide that is critical for the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Ferroptosis can also be induced by inhibitors of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) which detoxifies lipid peroxides using GSH as a co-factor. Yet depletion of GSH itself has not been shown to induce ferroptosis, for reasons that are unclear. We hypothesize that depletion of cysteine is qualitatively distinct from the depletion of glutathione and that additional cysteine?derived metabolites play a critical role in the detoxification of lipid ROS and control of ferroptosis.  Several inhibitors of System xc? have been identified that effectively induce ferroptosis in vitro, including erastin, sulfasalazine, and sorafenib, and new inhibitors are rapidly being developed. The overarching goal of this proposal is to determine the underlying mechanisms of ferroptosis induction through System xc? inhibition, including the identification of determinants of ferroptosis sensitivity. We bring to bear a range of innovative tools, including cysteine and methionine carbon labeling, mass spectrometry, chemical biology approaches, inducible lentiviral shRNA knockdown of key metabolic enzymes, systems biology techniques, small animal imaging, and translational therapeutics using genetically engineered mouse models. In addition to 2D cell line and organoid culture models, we also present pilot data from a sophisticated genetically engineered mouse model that enables the acute deletion of System xc? in established K-ras/p53 mutant pancreatic tumors. This six-allele dual recombinase mouse strategy provides an ideal genetic strategy for the evaluation of System xc? function in PDA and serves as a source for genetically?defined primary cells to facilitate our proposed mechanism studies. Finally, we will evaluate a candidate mechanistic pathway using a novel combination of two repurposed, clinically?developed agents, each of which is individually well-tolerated."
"9273232","Project Summary/Abstract We propose to upgrade the existing DEER/EPR spectrometer at the University of Washington (UW) to achieve higher sensitivity and higher sample throughput. DEER is a structural technique for the quantification of protein conformational landscapes and protein motions on the nanometer scale. Protein motions underlie the molecular processes at the basis of human life and disease. Therefore, DEER is a crucial technique that provides insights that contribute to the knowledge base necessary for drug development. In combination with X-ray crystallography, NMR and cryo- electron microscopy, DEER is part of a complementary set of experimental biostructural tools. It is especially important for the study of membrane proteins. The number of University of Washington (UW) researchers active in the area of biostructural and molecular biomedical sciences has increased substantially in recent years. There is increased demand for DEER measurement time from a variety of NIH-funded researchers at UW. The existing DEER instrument is old and not able to meet the increased demand due to its inherently low sensitivity. The upgrade requested in this project will (a) dramatically enhance sample throughput to provide more DEER data to more investigators, (b) provide increased resolving power with respect to conformational populations and conformational changes in proteins, (c) provide significantly higher sensitivity that will allow the investigation of proteins and protein complexes at lower concentrations, including full-length membrane proteins. This will expand the scope of systems that can be studied. Research projects that will benefit from the new upgraded DEER capabilities include the study of the molecular mechanisms of allosteric regulation in a broad range of ion channels (HCN, KCNH, TRPV1), the development of new molecular probes for protein kinases from the SRC family, the study of ubiquitin ligases from pathogenic bacteria, and the evaluation of de novo designs of proteins for health applications. Overall, the upgrade will significantly expand the scope of biostructural research at UW, which is conducted in a collaborative multidisciplinary environment."
"9233713","PROJECT SUMMARY: Pathology?determining the causes and effects of disease, often by using a microscope to examine patients' tissue?is essential for arriving at a correct cancer diagnosis, but it has become increasingly important to submit relevant portions of often tiny tissue samples for DNA and other molecular and functional tests. Making sure that the submitted material actually contains tumor, in sufficient quantity, is not always easy, and sometimes just preparing conventional microscope slides can consume most or even the entire specimen. We have developed a new, simple and inexpensive approach we term MUSE, for Microscopy with UV Surface Excitation, that can provide high-resolution images directly and quickly from fresh tissue without consuming it, and thus can preserve intact, high-quality specimens for biobanking, downstream molecular and functional analyses.  MUSE, by ensuring that acquired small biopsy specimens are indeed fit for purpose, can avoid the need to have a patient return at a later date for additional biopsies. In addition, the method will allow for lesion detection over larger cross-sections of tissue, such as organ whole-mounts, not currently practical with conventional instrumentation. Finally, we expect that MUSE will yield additional biologically informative imaging by avoiding artifacts inherent in conventional tissue processing and sectioning. We focus here on facilitation of tissue-based molecular studies, viable tumor harvest for xenografts and cultured spheroids, and biobanking, and include crucial validation studies to ensure that the MUSE process does not compromise sample utility due to possible impacts from exposure to intercalating dyes and/or UV light.  MUSE relies on two mechanisms: 1) surface-restricted excitation of fluorescent dyes due to micron- scale penetration of sub-300-nm ultraviolet light; and 2) the fact that many conventional dyes excited in this way emit visible light. These signals are bright enough to be detected by conventional color cameras using sub-second exposure times, allowing rapid imaging of large areas.  MUSE eliminates any requirement for conventional histology processing with formalin fixation, paraffin embedding, or thin-sectioning. It requires no lasers, confocal, multiphoton or optical coherence tomography instrumentation, can eventually cost in the range of a few thousands of dollars, and therefore affordable at the point of care (point of biopsy). MUSE samples are stained within seconds using familiar histology stains, such as eosin and DAPI, and the resulting high-resolution images converted from fluorescence to H&E-like brightfield appearance for interpretation in real time (but with novel and potentially useful features) easily interpreted by pathologists.  While rapid cellular-scale imaging of fresh tissue can have significant benefits in clinical arenas, it can also empower basic and translational research use for essentially instant histology-, pathology- or toxicology-relevant images directly from experimental animal models?at the bench?and may help relieve such investigators from having to rely on often overworked, sometimes unavailable, conventional histology and pathology services."
"9287941","The overall objective of the proposed research is to utilize a newly discovered, active transendothelial transport pathway, the caveolae pumping system, in order to provide an effective solution to the delivery and toxicity problem of Pt(II)-based chemotherapeutics in breast cancer. Systemic chemotherapy is one of the common forms of breast cancer treatments, however clinical efficacy of Pt(II) antitumor drugs is limited by the significant in vivo barriers inhibit delivery of these drugs into solid tumors, requiring the use of high doses, producing serious side effects and facilitating development of drug resistance. In order to address these problems and significantly improve treatment of breast cancer we propose two novel paradigms: 1) our newly discovered endothelial cell (EC) caveolae targeting system to sidestep passive delivery and dramatically enhance speed and efficiency of tumor penetration, and 2) to design and develop novel platinum(II) supramolecular coordination complexes (Pt(II)-SCCs), the nanoparticles (NPs) that have shown remarkable efficacy in tumor destruction in preclinical breast cancer models while being monodisperse, stable and well-characterized. Our main hypothesis is that immunoconjugates that fully utilize the advantages of caveolae-targeting antibodies will increase Pt(II)-SCCs delivery into tumors for enhanced efficacy and reduced toxicity, potentially resulting in a fundamentally new class of anticancer therapeutics. This hypothesis will be tested by the following specific aims: In Aim 1, we plan to design and synthesize Pt(II)-SCC immunoconjugates. In this Aim will also design, synthesize and characterize the chemical identity, purity and physicochemical properties of our Pt(II)-SCCs immunoconjugates. We will use caveolae-targeted antibody which we have shown can move the attached cargo from the blood across the EC barrier into solid tumor with unprecedented speed and specificity. In Aim 2 we will characterize in vivo delivery of Pt(II)-SCC immunoconjugates targeting the EC caveolae in tumors. We will perform dynamic monitoring of antibody-Pt(II)-SCC targeting in real time in live mice with intravital microscopy (IVM) using fluorescence emission of the assembled SCCs. In Aim 3 we will assess the therapeutic efficacy of the EC-targeting Pt(II)-SCC immunoconjugates. The efficacy of our targeted delivery system will be examined in IVM models using fluorescence microscopy and in non-IVM Her2/Neu tumor models with whole-body animal imaging. The long-term goal of this project is to translate our key basic discoveries into an innovative drug delivery platform in order to improve therapeutic efficacy and reduce toxicity in the breast cancer treatment."

"9233750","Project II. piRNA pathway organization and precursor processing William Theurkauf, P. I. Project Summary PIWI interacting RNAs (piRNAs) have a conserved function in transcriptional and post- transcriptional transposon silencing in the germline, which is dedicated to transmitting the inherited genome. Here we focus on identifying conserved organizational principles and molecular mechanisms driving transposon control by the piRNA pathway. Transposon control by piRNAs is best understood in Drosophila, where the primary piRNAs that initiate silencing are derived from large heterochromatic ?clusters? composed of nested transposon fragments. Cluster transcripts appear to be processed into mature piRNAs in nuage, which is an electron dense structure closely associated with the cytoplasmic surface of germline nuclei. In flies, heterochromatic clusters at the nuclear periphery appear to organize the perinuclear nuage, forming a compartment that spans the nuclear envelope. This compartment appears to increase the efficiency and specificity of piRNA production, with is critical to germline development. Studies under Aim1 will define this novel germline specific compartment in flies, mouse and worm. How cluster transcripts are differentiated from mRNAs and processed into mature piRNAs is a critical to the specificity of the system, but remains poorly understood. A complex of Drosophila nuclear proteins suppresses cluster transcript splicing, stalled splicing appears to trigger transposon silencing siRNA production in the pathogenic yeast Cryptocccus, and several putative splicing factors are required for fertility in mouse and humans. These observations suggest that stalled splicing has a conserved role in differentiating piRNA precursors from pre-mRNAs. Studies under Aim 2 will broadly define precursor flow though the piRNA pathway, and test the novel hypothesis that regulated splicing differentiates transposons from protein coding. Relevance Transposons and transposon remnants comprise approximately half of the human genome and represent a potentially explosive source of genome instability. Mobilization of these elements can induce insertions, deletions and rearrangements that cause disease, sterility, and developmental defects. The goals of the proposed studies are to define conserved organizational principles and molecular mechanisms that directly impact human reproductive heath."
"9215355","SUMMARY- Intimal hyperplasia characterized by abnormal accumulation of smooth muscle cell (SMC)-like cells and inflammatory cells is a hallmark of vascular occlusive disorders such as post angioplasty restenosis, vein graft atherosclerosis, and allograft vasculopathy. The current therapies with drug-eluting stents to inhibit SMC proliferation and induce SMC death still have problems due to limited endothelial cell regrowth and increased risk of thrombosis. Moreover, drug-eluting stents effective for focal lesions are not appropriate for diffuse atherosclerotic disease. Thus, there is high demand to develop novel therapeutic strategies. Our unbiased genome-wide genetic polymorphism association study in mice has identified cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A, catalyzing cyclic nucleotide hydrolysis) as a potential candidate gene contributing to injury-induced intimal hyperplasia. Indeed, PDE10A expression is markedly elevated in the intimal SMC-like cells and macrophages in mouse models of vascular injury and in human atherosclerotic lesions. Our preliminary data with PDE10A knockout mice and PDE10 inhibitor suggest that PDE10A is important in pathological vascular remodeling in vivo. In cultured SMCs, PDE10A depletion or inhibition increases myocardin protein (a master driver of SMC contractile phenotype) and expression of several SMC contractile marker genes. In macrophages, we found that PDE10A is important for NLRP3 inflammasome expression and activation. PDE10A expression is up-regulated by growth factors and inflammatory cytokines. Bioinformatic analysis identified a highly conserved intronic putative transcriptional regulatory sequence at the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) site identified by our mouse genetic association study, and it may be responsible for regulating PDE10A gene expression during phenotype switching and stimulation of inflammation. Thus, we hypothesize that increased PDE10A expression, by inhibiting cAMP signaling, promotes synthetic SMC phenotype transition and macrophage inflammasome expression/activation; and thus stimulates intimal hyperplasia. The overall objective of this proposal is to investigate the mechanisms that regulate expression of PDE10A, and PDE10A's specific role in the processes responsible for intimal hyperplasia. To achieve our goals, two Specific Aims are proposed: (1) Determine the role of PDE10A in intimal formation and vascular remodeling after injury using both genetic and pharmacological approaches. (2) Define the mechanisms for PDE10A regulation of vascular pathology: regulation of PDE10A expression, transition of SMC phenotype, and stimulation of vascular inflammation. PDE10A is well known in psychosis; and PDE10A inhibitor has been developed for clinical trials to treat schizophrenia. However, PDE10A regulation and function in cardiovascular system remains largely unknown. Our studies should yield novel therapeutic strategies to limit pathologic intimal hyperplasia given PDE10A has proved to be a druggable target."
"9325858","Abstract Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with TDF/FTC is an effective prevention intervention for HIV acquisition, in particular when adherence is high [1-4]. However, poor adherence renders this therapy ineffective [5]. Innovations recently introduced into the field of systemic PrEP are long-acting (LA) formulations of antiretrovirals (ARVs) that stably release drugs over many weeks as nano-formulations [6] and have activity in animal models of prevention [7]. To date no systemic LA drug formulations have demonstrated HIV prevention in humans though phase II safety studies of LA Cabotegravir are underway. Injection of these LA ARV are preceded by approximately one month of therapy with the oral formulations to assess for allergy or serious toxicity as once injected these agents have detectable levels for months and the drug cannot be removed or have clearance accelerated. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to address these limitations and develop an injectable polymer-based delivery system for LA PrEP that offers durable and sustained protection from HIV transmission, high efficacy of HIV inhibition, increased user compliance, and the ability to be removed in case of unanticipated adverse events or when considering discontinuation from the LA PrEP. We will achieve this goal by developing a liquid ARV formulation utilizing excipients that form a biodegradable depot after subcutaneous injection (in-situ forming implant (ISFI)). We propose a comprehensive evaluation of this novel drug delivery approach using 1) highly relevant transmitted/founder viruses and highly relevant modes of HIV acquisition via physiologically relevant cell-free and cell-associated viruses, in the presence of human semen using BLT humanized mice; and 2) a highly relevant macaque model of mucosal simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) as an invaluable preclinical tool to assess the efficacy of the ISFI against SHIV acquisition. This cutting edge combined approach will be utilized to evaluate the scientific premise of our proposal to investigate whether sustained protection against HIV acquisition can be achieved using a unique and highly innovative long-acting coitally-independent antiretroviral ISFI formulation."

Protection following vaccination will be assessed using autologous and heterologous SHIVs from Project 1. Specific aims of Project 3 are: 1. To express autologous TF and evolved Envs from SHIV-infected RM as recombinant gp120s and  as stabilized trimers; 2. To perform binding assays of bNAb lineage BCRs with evolved autologous and heterologous Envs  and, in conjunction with the Bioinformatics and Statistics Core, to design sequential Env immunogens  based on binding affinity and/or on mutations inferred bioinformatically to be associated with bnAbs recognition; 3. To perform immunization studies of Env constructs in bNAb germline humanized mice and RM, including:  (a) B cell repertoire analysis and plasma neutralization assays on vaccinated mice  and RMs in collaboration with Project 2,  (b) sequential immunizations with adjuvants and checkpoint inhibitor  administration to promote bNAb lineage survival and maturation, and  (c) negative-stained EMs and vaccine-induced antibody-Env co-crystallization  studies of vaccine-induced antibodies. Project 3 will synergize with Projects 1 and 2 and Cores B and C to complete the pre-clinical translational pipeline for developing HIV vaccine strategies based on recapitulating the virologic and immunologic events that occur in bNAb development during transmitted/founder Env SHIV infection in RMs."
"9209155","Project Summary  We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated, open access biomolecular pathway database that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by clinicians, geneti- cists, genomics researchers, and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomic studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and disease variant pathways.  Our curators, PhD-level scientists with backgrounds in cell and molecular biology work closely with in- dependent investigators within the community to assemble machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated Reactome pathways currently cover 8930 protein- coding genes (44% of the translated portion of the genome) and ~150 RNA genes. We also offer a network of reliable ?functional interactions? (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, which covers an additional 3300 genes, for a combined coverage of roughly 60% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we will: (1) curate new macromolecular entities, clinically significant protein sequence variants and isoforms, and drug-like molecules, and the complexes these entities form, into new reac- tions; (2) supplement normal pathways with alternative pathways targeted to significant diseases and devel- opmental biology; (3) expand and automate our tools for curation, management and community annotation; (4) integrate pathway modeling technologies using probabilistic graphical models and Boolean networks for pathway and network perturbation studies; (5) develop additional compelling software interfaces directed at both computational and lab biologist users; and (6) and improve outreach to bioinformaticians, molecular bi- ologists and clinical researchers."
"9233000","Non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) are increasingly being recognized as important causes of invasive disease (e.g. sepsis, meningitis) in the very young and the elderly in the USA. The growing resistance of NTS strains to multiple antibiotics further complicates treatment. NTS disease in the USA is accounted for primarily by serovars belonging to three serogroups (B, C and D). Our overall goal is to develop a broad-spectrum vaccine against these invasive NTS serogroups. We have already developed live oral and conjugate vaccines against Group B {Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhimurium) and D (S. Enteritidis) serovars that can protect against invasive NTS disease with the wild-type homologous pathogen. Although less common than strains of Salmonella Groups B and D, Group C organisms represent a significant proportion of NTS cases, and some Group C serovars (e.g. S. Choleraesuis) are highly invasive. The purpose of this translational research proposal is to develop Salmonella Group C live attenuated and conjugate vaccines. Our central hypothesis is that appropriately engineered attenuated strains of Salmonella enterica Group Cl and C2 serovars can: 1) allow safe, high yield preparation of core-0 polysaccharide (COPS) and flagella protein for making conjugate vaccines, and 2) serve as protective live attenuated vaccines. We will select suitable Salmonella Group Cl and C2 strains and genetically engineer them so that they are attenuated and secrete large amounts of Phase 1 flagellin protein into the supernatant. We will purify COPS and flagellin from these strains and construct COPS-FliC conjugate vaccines using various chemical strategies. These conjugates will be evaluated in adult and aged mice. Live attenuated Salmonella Group Cl and C2 vaccine strains will also be evaluated for their ability to protect adult and aged mice. We will also determine whether gnotobiotic piglets can be protected from invasive disease by S. Choleraesuis conjugate and live oral vaccines. We will ascertain whether NTS vaccines can also protect against gastroenteritis by testing our live attenuated S. Typhimurium vaccine CVD 1931 in the rhesus macaque model of Salmonella gastroenteritis. Finally, we will determine whether a multivalent formulation of live oral or conjugate Group B, C and D Salmonella vaccines can prevent invasive disease caused by Group B, C and D serovars. If we are successful, these results will pave the way for initiating future Phase 1 clinical trials and we will have addressed three ofthe four broad objectives of this multi-center research proposal."

"9346782","Heart failure (HF) continues to be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and one form of HF that is increasing to near epidemic proportions is that which arises from a sustained pressure overload (LVPO). LVPO is invariably associated with increased extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, causing increased myocardial stiffness, impaired diastolic function, and the signs and symptoms of HF. One unifying observation is that with LVPO and the progression to HF, a shift in the relative balance between matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs) occur. More specifically, it is now recognized that a large diversity exists with respect to TIMP expression and function. TIMP-4 has been shown to alter fibroblast proliferation, survival, and collagen expression, and we have now identified that in contrast to that of TIMP-1, increased myocardial levels of TIMP-4 may actually prevent abnormal ECM remodeling and dysfunction with LVPO. This project will test the central hypothesis that HF progression with LVPO is due to inadequate TIMP-4 induction, thereby causing a shift in the TIMP stoichiometric balance favoring fibroblast transformation, ECM accumulation, increased myocardial stiffness, and thus drives the HF process forward. There are 3 aims of this project. Specific Aim 1 will establish that a transition to HF with LVPO can be predicted by a shift in TIMP-1/TIMP-4 balance and that this represents a tipping point whereby a shift in fibroblast transformation and proliferation occurs, accompanied by increased transforming growth factor (TGF) signaling and ECM accumulation, causing a rapid rise in regional myocardial stiffness. Specific Aim 2 will demonstrate that in a progressive model of LVPO in pigs, regional augmentation of recombinant TIMP-4 (rTIMP-4) through a novel hydrogel delivery system will prevent fibroblast transformation, ECM accumulation, and myocardial stiffness. Moreover, we will demonstrate that localized release of rTIMP-4 following the development of LVPO will reverse this ECM phenotype and thereby reduce myocardial stiffness. In Specific Aim 3, we will advance our delivery of rTIMP-4 to an intracoronary approach and demonstrate an interruption in the progression to HF with LVPO. Through an integrated set of translational studies, the outcomes from this project will define a new insight into how TIMPs, such as TIMP-4, contribute to the development of HF secondary to LVPO, provide a readily translatable approach in terms of a new diagnostic that can be used to predict the progression of this HF process, and finally establish a novel therapeutic direction for this significant cause of HF."
"9235283","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The past 10 years have witnessed a stunning convergence between basic and clinical visual science. Basic advances in optogenetics, retinal array fabrication, stem cell biology, angiogenesis pathways, and microscopy have all seen rapid application in the clinical setting. The ideal visual scientist of the future, today's trainee, nees to have a multidisciplinary background so as to be well-versed in both basic science and clinical applications. The objective of the Northwestern University Multidisciplinary Vision Training Program is to prepare pre- and postdoctoral trainees for independent careers in vision research broadly defined to include diseases and functions of the anterior eye, diseases and processing mechanisms of the retina, and central processing. The rationale for this proposal is to capitalize on the existing multidisciplinary research base at Northwestern University by integrating labs into a cohesive unit for the purposes of training. The 20 preceptors offer research training in cel and molecular biology, genetics, neurobiology of the visual system, advanced microscopy, stem cells, diseases of the anterior and posterior eye, and evidenced based analysis of treatment outcomes and healthcare delivery. Funding to support 2 predoctoral candidates, after they have begun full time thesis research, and 2 postdoctoral trainees, in the early or middle stages of training, is requested. The predoctoral trainees are recruited on the basis of course performance, rotation evaluations, and relevance of the proposed dissertation research from the Northwestern University Integrated Neuroscience (NUIN) program, the Interdepartmental Biological Sciences (IBiS) program, the Driskill Graduate Program in Life Sciences (DGP), and the Biomedical Engineering (BME) Graduate Program. Predocs are supported for three years. Postdoctoral trainees are selected for support for two years based on research record and preceptor recommendation. A Steering Committee evaluates and selects trainees from among the eligible pre- and postdocs. The training program also educates students in the ethics of science and responsible conduct of research. Major emphasis is placed on recruiting trainees from under-represented minority groups to vision research. The program for each trainee is determined by the trainee, preceptor, and Steering Committee who formulate an individual development plan. The Program Director is Steven H. DeVries, MD, PhD, Professor of Ophthalmology and Physiology and the co-Director is Jianhua Cang, PhD, Associate Professor of Neurobiology. In addition to research training, the program offers a curriculum that includes two formal courses (mandatory for pre-docs), a biweekly presentation series on advanced topics in vision, multiple journal clubs, invited lectures by nationally known researchers, and a Research Day. It is expected that the trainees will continue as independent, productive, and ethical investigators who will address national priorities in vision research."
"9300303","The long-term objective underlying the research proposed within this exploratory R21 application is to understand how host inflammation associated with the chronic human pathogen, Helicobacter pylori (Hp), fully impacts human health and disease. The persistent inflammation localized within the gastric mucosa during chronic Hp infection is considered the major risk factor for the onset of gastric diseases, including gastric ulcer disease and gastric adenocarcinoma. However, persistent low-level systemic inflammation also accompanies Hp gastric infection, which has been increasingly associated with extra-gastric diseases. The major gap in knowledge to be addressed in this application is the extent to which neuroinflammation, which is synonymous with brain inflammation, accompanies chronic gastric infection with Hp. In vivo animal infection studies, using Sprague-Dawley rats as an established model for studying cognitive performance, will be conducted to evaluate the previously unexplored hypothesis that chronic gastric infection with Hp promotes neuroinflammation. Preliminary results support this hypothesis, by revealing that elevated brain inflammation accompanies short-term gastric infection with Hp. Here, we propose studies to extend the duration of Hp infection to study both systemic and neuroinflammation under conditions that more closely recapitulate chronic infection. To understand the underlying mediators of systemic and neuroinflammation, levels of innate immune inflammatory cytokines normally associated with Hp gastric infection will be monitored. Finally, the causal relationship between Hp infection and neuroinflammation will be explored by monitoring neuroinflammation in the brains of animals whose Hp infections were eradicated by antibiotic administration. Results from the studies proposed here will not only advance our understanding of the extra-gastric effects of chronic Hp infection, but will also provide the necessary experimental framework for future collaborative studies to investigate the impact of neuroinflammation on the cognitive performance of animals chronically infected with Hp."
"9407381","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Elevated postprandial levels of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) in the circulation are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Following a meal, chylomicrons produced by the intestine contribute prominently to circulating triglyceride (TG) levels, and production is primarily determined by the amount of fat ingested and absorbed. However, growing evidence suggests the intestine can actively regulate the rate of postprandial chylomicron production in part through transient TG storage and delayed export. Further, individuals with metabolic syndrome often exhibit hyperchylomicronemia. Thus, misregulation of intestinal TG storage and turnover likely contributes to disease risk. Intestinal enterocytes absorb and package dietary fatty acids into TG that is exported via chylomicrons or stored in cytoplasmic lipid droplets (LD). LDs are subcellular organelles composed of a core of TG and cholesterol esters surrounded by a monolayer of phospholipids and a variety of proteins, including perilipins. Intestinal LDs are dynamic storage compartments; they increase in number and size in the hours following a high-fat meal, but are nearly depleted 12-14 hours later in the absence of another meal. However, if a subsequent meal is consumed before the stored TG is depleted, it is rapidly exported in chylomicrons, suggesting that LD turnover is regulated. Despite the implications of intestinal LD regulation on postprandial serum TG levels, the mechanisms governing enterocyte LD regulation are poorly characterized. The overall goal of this proposal is to elucidate the cellular mechanisms regulating the maintenance and turnover of intestinal LDs following both an acute high-fat meal and in response to re- feeding. These studies will capitalize on the powerful transgenic and in vivo imaging opportunities afforded by the zebrafish model vertebrate system. Aim 1 of this proposal will determine whether LDs in enterocytes undergo rapid lipolysis by neutral lipases in response to re-feeding or are degraded by autophagy-mediated lipolysis. In Aim 2, the role of the LD-associated protein perilipin-2 in regulating intestinal LD storage and turnover will be explored. Human variants of perilipin-2 that are associated with favorable lipoprotein profiles will be evaluated to determine whether they alter intestinal LD dynamics. Aim 3 will establish whether zebrafish detect fat as a taste sensation and if this results in neural activation that is sufficient to elicit LD breakdown and chylomicron release in the fish, as has been suggested by human studies. Understanding intestinal regulation of lipid storage and lipoprotein production is imperative for development of strategies for the prevention and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia. Collectively, the proposed experiments will elucidate the cellular mechanisms regulating the storage and turnover of lipid in the intestine, produce novel methods and tools to study LD dynamics in vivo, and establish whether the zebrafish is a valid model to address how the brain communicates fat taste detection to intestinal enterocytes."
"9223619","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rates of binge drinking in the military currently hover at 47% and constitute a public health crisis (IOM, 2012), with few evidence-based prevention programs in place to stem the tide. Hazardous drinking among service members is directly detrimental to psychological fitness and military readiness, and is also a risk factor for several overlapping problems, including alcohol use disorder (AUD), use of other drugs, depression, suicide, and relationship conflict. This R34, Testing A Couple-based Program for Alcohol Risk Reduction in the National Guard, in line with PAR-12-279, aims to develop and test an indicated, secondary prevention intervention to harness marital support and health promoting endeavors such as relationship enhancement and problem solving to replace use of alcohol to cope with reintegration challenges. Up to 81% of military members are married or in a committed relationship and the integration of couple-based prevention programs into military service settings has been identified as a promising but underutilized health promotion strategy. National Guard (NG) members and their families are a special needs population due to high rates of heavy drinking, mental health, and family problems, paired with geographic challenges that limit access to military heath care support systems. The proposed indicated secondary prevention project targets hazardous drinking NG members who have not yet developed AUD. Aim 1 is to modify our efficacious Alcohol Behavioral Couple Therapy (ABCT) manual into a brief indicated secondary prevention protocol called Alcohol Behavioral Couple Prevention (ABCP), available for in-person or telehealth delivery by professionals or paraprofessionals in military settings. The goal of the new ABCP is for couples to learn to work together to minimize hazardous drinking in order to then begin to effectively address other problems often present among returning service members. Aim 2 is to field test an in-person delivery platform of the protocol (ABCP_P) with 6 couples, refine, and then field test a telehealth delivery platform (ABCP_T) for the refined protocol with 6 new couples. Aim 3 is to conduct a small randomized controlled trial with 22 couples in each condition: (1) Prevention as usual (PAU) which includes annual briefings and a limited monitoring system currently in place in the NG; (2) PAU plus ABCP_P, and (3) PAU plus ABCP_T. Primary outcome variables include alcohol use, marital functioning and coping skills. Candidate mediators of health promotion behavior change, including attitudes and beliefs about drinking will be tracked. This project is in accord with IOM (2013) recommendations; it aims to fill a gap in prevention strategies for hazardous drinking and associated risks among service members, with an evidence-based risk reduction protocol to support overall force readiness while strengthening the family unit. Further, it includes a teleheath delivery platform to address geographic challenges and lower barriers to accessible services for the armed forces."

She is an expert advocate for sustainable policy, working within the Mongolian government structure, who lives in Ulaanbaatar and thus appreciates the importance of urgent evidence-based action on air pollution in her capital city. She will co-chair our international advisory committee and will act as a friend and mentor to recruit, retain and develop MSCEHRTC program graduates to affect sustainable evidence-based change on the consequences of air pollution across the lifespan at the national policy and implementation level in Mongolia."
"9316787","SUMMARY Excluding the great apes, the immune system of Indian rhesus macaques (RMs) most closely approximates that of humans. Thus, it is widely believed that the RM represents the closest practical animal model for evaluating protective immunity to HIV-1 and vaccines that might elicit such protection. For the analysis of HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), RMs have in the past been infected with simian-human immunodeficiency viruses (SHIVs) that bear HIV-1 Envs that were heavily adapted in cell culture or by animal passage, or they were immunized with any of numerous Env containing candidate vaccines ranging from Env peptides or DNA vectors to gp120 monomers to soluble stabilized Env trimers (SOSIPs). The findings from all such studies to date have been the same: Abs can be generated that neutralize heterologous tier 1 viruses, and in some instances autologous tier 2 viruses, but generally not heterologous tier 2 viruses that constitute virtually all primary HIV-1 strains and are responsible for clinical HIV-1 transmission. Surprisingly, there is no direct experimental evidence that RMs have the potential to develop heterologous tier 2 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) even if vaccinated with an appropriate immunogen. Thus, a major roadblock to HIV-1 vaccine development is that there is no animal model system where the elicitation of HIV-1 bNAbs can be reliably and consistently demonstrated, let alone be studied in an iterative fashion for rational vaccine design. Project 1 seeks to overcome this roadblock by capitalizing on recent discoveries by the Shaw lab regarding novel SHIV design strategies. The scientific premise of Project 1 is that since most examples of bNAb elicitation come from natural human infection by primary strains of HIV-1, the most likely means to elicit bNAbs in RMs is by infection with SHIVs bearing primary HIV-1 Envs in their native conformations. A key hypothesis that we will test is that SHIVs bearing primary or transmitted/founder (T/F) Envs will engage rhesus germline and intermediate ancestor B cell receptors (BCRs) that are orthologous to those engaged by the same Envs in human infection and that patterns of virus-Ab coevolution leading to the development of neutralizing antibody specificity, potency and breadth will be similar in both species. Specific Aims of Project 1 are to: (i) analyze in 33 RMs the in vivo replication kinetics and NAb responses of 11 novel SHIVs whose Envs are known to bind to human bNAb lineage BCRs targeting the V3-glycan supersite (CH848, CH694, CH040), V1V2 supersite (CAP256SU, ZM233, WITO, Q23, T250-4, CH1012), CD4bs (CH505) or other (BG505), and down-select to two SHIVs for inoculation into 9 RMs each; (ii) analyze in vivo replication kinetics and env evolutionary pathways of SHIVs targeting V3-glycan or V1V2 germline and IA BCRs; and (iii) determine the kinetics, potency and breadth of polyclonal NAb responses and map epitope specificities by a combination of Env fingerprinting, Env-expression cloning, and site-directed mutagenesis. Project 1 will link closely with Cores B and C for sequencing and bioinformatics and Projects 2 and 3 for sample provision and data interpretation."
"9445777","Project Summary The vast heterogeneity of genetic and epigenetic features both among samples from any cancer type and within individual tumors has been documented with increasing resolution. Of note, intratumoral heterogeneity, which fuels clonal evolution and generates treatment resistance, has been identified as the foremost obstacle to lasting cure. This is true of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), an initially indolent malignancy of mature B cells which inevitably becomes more aggressive over time, and whose clinical course is highly variable across individuals. Despite the recent approval of highly potent drugs (i.e. ibrutinib, idelalisib) that target key CLL pathways, drug resistance?sometimes associated with highly aggressive relapse while on treatment?has been reported. The challenges presented by this disease heterogeneity mandate large-scale interdisciplinary approaches to link genomic features with cellular behavior so that effective personalized treatments can be devised. Our hypothesis is that CLL has heterogeneous yet coherent genomic alterations leading to distinct phenotypic behaviors, subject to evolutionary selective pressures, which impact individual disease trajectories. The members of the proposed Program have a successful track record of collaborating together to make landmark contributions to our understanding of CLL. Despite our growing knowledge about CLL and the expanding armamentarium of effective therapeutics targeting it, the next quantum leap in our understanding of this disease will require network-level integration across data layers in well-powered series to comprehensively map the circuitry of CLL (Projects 1, 2), and systematic approaches to evaluate the impact of genomic alterations on prognosis and response to therapy (Projects 2, 3). Certainly, conventional approaches to functionally study genetic lesions of CLL have been limited by the lack of faithful cell lines and mouse models and by the widely acknowledged difficulties in genetically manipulating primary CLL cells. Through major innovations in approaches to dissect CLL, spearheaded by each Project Leader and ranging from computational to functional genetic and non-genetic based readouts in primary human B cells, we are well- poised to synergize together to address clinically relevant questions in CLL. These initiatives are strongly supported by the joint expertise of the Core Leaders and are expected to inform us on the rational design of the next generation of personalized and curative therapies for CLL."
"9265077","The Yale Diabetes Research Center (DRC) was established in 1993 with the goal of promoting research in diabetes and related metabolic and endocrine disorders at the University. The DRC brings together a multidisciplinary group of over 100 member and associate member scientists as well as professional supporting  staff, new investigators and research trainees from in 16 departments and 4 colleges or schools at Yale University The scope of the research activities ofthe membership is very broad, ranging from basic molecular biology to whole body physiology and the treatment of diabetic patients. The members, however, share a common interest in research that is related to diabetes and metabolism or is fundamental to understanding its  pathogenesis or for the development of new treatment strategies. The design of the Yale DRC is aimed at developing an infrastructure that could serve as a catalyst to stimulate innovative diabetes-related research. The cornerstone of the DRC is its five Research Cores that provide funded basic and clinical investigators with the opportunity to more efficiently utilize resources and expand the scope of their research programs. The Clinical  Metabolism and the Diabetes Translational Cores facilitate metabolic research in patients, whereas the Molecular Genetic Mouse Core, Physiology and Cell Biology Cores that comprise the more basic science focus of the Center offer investigators the tools to create and test novel animal models starting from the molecule and ending with biological outcomes. The Administrative Core oversees the operation of the Center, its  Pilot/Feasibility Project and Enrichment Programs, and helps to coordinate patient-based research in diabetes.  The goals of the DRC are to: 1) stimulate multidisciplinary interactions, particulariy between basic and clinical scientists; 2) encourage established investigators not presently working in diabetes-related areas, to bring their expertise to bear on problems relevant to diabetes; 3) efficiently organize time consuming and/or costly techniques through Core facilities to enhance the productivity of investigators conducting research in diabetes  related areas; 4) promote new research programs through pilot feasibility projects; 5) enhance the quality of research training, and 6) create a stimulating institutional environment that enhances research efforts by its members to develop new strategies to prevent and treat diabetes and related metabolic disorders at the local and national level."
"9428868","Project Summary Natural killer (NK) cells play an important role in the human immune response to infection and malignancy. How these cells effectively distinguish between diseased and healthy tissue is one of the key unsolved problems in immunology today. The proposed work seeks to identify the mechanism(s) by which the small adaptor protein CT10 regulator of kinase (Crk), and its phosphorylation, control NK cell activation and inhibition by using both human NK cells and novel NK cell-specific conditional knockout mice. The long-term goal is to use this knowledge and the novel imaging techniques developed herein to uncover the molecular basis of NK cell activation and inhibition, and to develop new treatments for human primary immunodeficiency diseases and chronic diseases such as cancer and viral infection. NK cells kill target cells through the polarized release of lytic granules through a specialized region of cell-cell contact known as the immunological synapse (IS). Through previous studies of the cytotoxic (Liu, D. et al., Immunity, 2009, Cover Article) and inhibitory (Liu, D. et al., Immunity, 2012) IS, we discovered that Crk plays an essential upstream role at the IS, influencing signaling events required for both activation and inhibition. The molecular mechanisms underlying this dual role, however, remain unclear. We hypothesize that receptor-driven phosphorylation of Crk acts as a molecular switch, driving a conformational change, which in turn determines Crk's ability to interact with critical downstream signaling molecules and ultimately shapes the actin cytoskeleton into a functional IS. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will test these hypotheses via three Specific Aims: 1) Define the precise molecular mechanisms by which Crk controls NK cell activation and inhibition. The proposed work capitalizes on the recent explosion in single molecule imaging and will bring cutting-edge single molecule imaging technology to the field of NK research, with a focus on human primary immunodeficiency diseases; 2) Determine the role of Crk-like protein (CrkL) in NK cells from patients with partial DiGeorge syndrome (pDGS). Using one of most common (1 in 4,000 births) immunodeficiency diseases, pDGS (mainly caused by CrkL haploinsufficiency), we will determine how loss of CrkL function affects NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity in pDGS and its molecular mechanisms; 3) Determine whether Crk is required for NK function in vivo. Leveraging novel NK cell-specific Crk knockout mice that we have already generated, we will determine the roles that Crk molecules play in NK cell-mediated immune responses to viral infection and cancer in vivo. The proposed work involves key signaling players and novel regulatory mechanisms and is broadly relevant with direct clinical implications for the treatment of primary immunodeficiency diseases and cancer because elevated expression and increased phosphorylation of Crk are common to various cancers (e.g., lung cancer, breast cancer, glioblastoma, sarcomas, ovarian cancer, and hematopoietic cancers). The proposed work also generates a novel model system in which to determine Crk's role as a master regulatory molecule. !"
"9228920","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With improved financial and technical supports, many malaria endemic nations are once again considering malaria elimination as their national goal of malaria control. To achieve this ambitious goal, one of the greatest challenges is development of blood stage vaccines. Antigenic variation of PfEMP1 encoded by a 60-member var gene family and clonally expressed on the surface of Plasmodium falciparum-infected red blood cells is a critical virulence factor for malaria. Despite its central role in malaria pathogenesis during the asexual blood stage, the mechanism of mutually exclusive expression of var genes is still poorly understood, and this knowledge gap severely hinders the development of novel tools to kill blood stage parasites. This project, built on our recent success in creating a P. falciparum line with expression of all the var genes, aims to determine the molecular regulatory network and establish the hierarchy of var gene regulation mechanisms employing a set of recently developed genetic and epigenetic tools and resources. A comprehensive picture of var gene regulatory factors generated from this study will enable a better understanding of antigenic variation of the var gene family in immune evasion of malaria parasites. This information will also provide new targets for therapeutics to block PfEMP1-mediated immune evasion or complications of severe malaria, or enhance the ability of vaccines to maximize PfEMP1 expression for immune response."

"9435257","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Among known ALS genes, TDP-43 is of particular interest because its protein is hyper-phosphorylated and ubiquitinated in sporadic ALS. Compared with genetic mutation, post-translational modification is difficult to detect in patients and hard to reproduce in animal models. Therefore, a critical step toward understanding TDP-43 pathogenesis is revealing the pathways by which mutant TDP-43 causes neurodegeneration in ALS. TDP-43 binds to many RNAs and proteins, but how pathogenic mutation impacts TDP-43 function has not yet been determined, particularly in an appropriate animal model. Unexpectedly, overexpression of both WT and mutant TDP-43 in rodents causes indistinguishable phenotypes, indicating that excessive TDP-43 is neurotoxic. Because transgene expression is heavily influenced by position effect, the patterns and levels of transgene expression vary greatly from line to line. Whether mutant TDP-43 is more or less toxic than its WT form thus cannot be determined using existing transgenic models. The question regarding the impact of pathogenic mutation on TDP-43 function is further confounded by observations that TDP-43 depletion induces neurodegeneration in TDP-43 knock-out and knock-down mice. As TDP-43 binds to the 3'-untranslated region of its own mRNA and thereby regulates its own expression, the cDNA knock-in (KI) approach destroys TDP-43 self-regulatory machinery, rendering TDP-43 KI animals not very useful. Even 7 years after the discovery of TDP-43 mutation in ALS, whether mutant TDP-43 causes ALS through a gain or loss of function is still uncertain, and this unresolved issue is a roadblock to unraveling TDP-43 disease mechanisms. To resolve this critical issue, we created KI rats by introducing a single disease-linked point mutation into the rat genome. With the unprecedented rat models, we will determine how pathogenic mutation impacts TDP-43 function in a systematic manner."
"9235326","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objective of this application is to advance primary prevention of stroke in patients at risk for stroke due to atherosclerosis of the carotid artery.  Four to eight percent of adults have asymptomatic carotid stenosis exceeding 50%. Carotid stenosis is often managed either by endarterectomy or stenting. About 100,000 carotid endarterectomies and 40,000 carotid stenting procedures are done each year in the US. Up to 90% of these procedures are done on asymptomatic patients. Medical therapy has improved. The ACST trial demonstrated that medical management of hyperlipidemia can attenuate the benefits of revascularization in patients with asymptomatic stenosis. Further advances in managing atherosclerotic risk factors may negate benefit that might otherwise be realized through revascularization, making the morbidity of the procedures unjustifiable. Endarterectomy and stenting have also improved. The results for endarterectomy in CREST showed a periprocedural stroke and death rate of 1.4%. For stenting, the rate was the lowest yet reported in a randomized controlled trial, 2.5%, and that rate was improving in the last tertil of enrollment.  We will conduct two parallel randomized, multicenter non-inferiority trials (CREST-2). The primary specific aims will be to compare the effectiveness of intensive medical management to carotid endarterectomy (n=1050) and also to compare the effectiveness of intensive medical management to stenting (n=1050) for patients with high-grade asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. The primary endpoint will be a composite of any stroke or death within 30 days of randomization plus ipsilateral stroke up to 4 years of follow-up. Vascular risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking and hyperlipidemia, will be managed centrally using modern aggressive targets. Should intensive medical management be declared non-inferior to endarterectomy, stenting or both, up to 5,000 periprocedural strokes may be prevented."
"9275015","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Developmental brain disorders (DBD) comprise an etiologically-heterogeneous, behaviorally-defined group of conditions affecting a significant percentage of U.S. children and adults. Shared genomic underpinnings now directly connect seemingly unrelated DBD, including autism (ASD), intellectual disability and schizophrenia. DBD have traditionally been studied using categorical criteria (e.g., ASD versus no ASD) that are no longer consistent with biological evidence. Here, we propose a genome-first approach to the study of DBD, examining normally distributed quantitative traits that extend into the general population. We will characterize differential patterns of functional and medical impact of DBD-related pathogenic loss of function (pLOF) variants in 100,000 patients from Geisinger Health System through the use of EHR data mining algorithms, with the following aims: 1) Use a cross-disorder, genomics-driven approach to create a comprehensive knowledge base of DBD genes and copy number variant (CNV) regions. We will expand the knowledge base for identifying DBD loci using existing tools from our previous work: 1) a dosage map of the human genome and 2) a loss of function, single gene prediction model based on literature annotation for six specific types of DBD. High-confidence DBD genes and CNV regions will be used in Aim 2 for genomic variant mining of whole exome sequencing (WES) data. 2) Conduct large-scale, population-based analyses to identify a cohort with DBD pLOF variants. We will use WES data, generated as part of another Geisinger study, to analyze the frequency of DBD pLOF variants in 100,000 patients representing an unselected cross-section of our patient population. Individuals with a DBD pLOF variant (n=4,000) and their family members will be phenotyped in Aims 3 & 4. 3) Characterize quantitative phenotypes in individuals with DBD pLOF variants and their families. Among patients with DBD pLOF, we will use linked EHR data to document clinical DBD diagnoses. We will administer in-person and online assessments to measure quantitative, heritable traits including cognitive performance, adaptive behavior, and social function. We will also assess these traits in first-degree relatives to examine the effect of family background on phenotypic variability. We will describe dimensional, quantitative neurodevelopmental profiles that capture the full phenotypic spectrum associated with specific pLOF variants. 4) Assess medical comorbidities and healthcare utilization among individuals with DBD pLOF variants. We will survey our EHR dataset to compare medical comorbidities and healthcare utilization between individuals with and without pLOF variants. We will examine a range of variables including DBD-related specialty visits and prescription use, hospitalizations and surgical procedures, hypothesizing that comorbidities and utilization will be significantly higher among people with pLOF variants, regardless of whether they have a known clinical DBD diagnosis. Characterization of differential patterns of clinical diagnosis, neurodevelopmental function, medical impact and healthcare utilization based on genomic variants will ultimately pave the way for targeted interventions for DBD."
"9225240","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Regulated protein turnover is critical for cellular decision-making in all eukaryotes. The rate of degradation often acts as a pacemaker to coordinate responses within and between cells and is frequently dysregulated in human disease. Yet we know remarkably little about what controls substrate degradation kinetics. One possible reason is the lack of available models for high resolution structure-function analysis of turnover rates. The SCF class of E3 ubiquitin ligases is highly conserved among animals, plants and fungi. Within these complexes, F-boxes act as substrate-recognition subunits to add ubiquitin to diverse targets. We propose to use an SCF involved in auxin response, at the heart of nearly every aspect of plant biology, as a model to investigate general principles underlying E3 function. The small-molecule triggered degradation in the auxin pathway offers a unique advantage for these studies, and has facilitated our engineering of auxin-induced degradation in yeast. Using this system, we discovered that F-boxes greatly impact the rate of degradation and that previously uncharacterized sequences accelerated or decelerated degradation in a substrate-specific manner. Our central hypothesis is that the wide range of auxin-induced substrate degradation dynamics are critical for achieving the wide range of auxin-regulated cellular responses, and that these dynamics are encoded by distinct domains within F-boxes and substrates. To test this hypothesis, we propose to: (1) identify determinants of degradation rate in F-boxes and substrates. We have already identified two new substrate domains controlling degradation rates and several new F-box domains of interest. Structural studies are underway to investigate the functional relevance of these domains, and we are using a number of tools to quantify complex affinity to test the degree to which this parameter dictates degradation rates. (2) quantify the impact of varying degradation rate on transcription. We have extended our synthetic assays to include auxin- induced transcription. We can now quantify and mathematically model the relationship between substrate turnover and downstream responses. This technology enables our study of previously intractable problems like the impact of substrate dimerization on auxin responses. (3) quantify the impact of varying degradation rate on development. We have preliminary data from transgenic plants linking substrate degradation rate to the proper development of new organs. We will perform in-depth cellular and molecular phenotypic analysis of these plants to analyze how developmental progression is affected by timing of substrate turnover. Together, the proposed work will provide a mechanistic framework for E3 function in the auxin response, facilitate identification of network architectures impacting signal sensitivity and duration, and potentially provide insights into fundamental properties of E3: substrate interactions. These insights can inform our understanding of E3s associated with human disease, as well as guiding future design of synthetic circuits using auxin components for diagnostic or therapeutic applications."
"9316783","SUMMARY Despite decades of HIV-1 vaccine research, there are no examples of immunogens or candidate vaccines that consistently elicit potent broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). Most examples of bNAbs come from natural HIV-1 infection of humans, but even then, they develop only after several years of infection and in only a subset of individuals. Nonetheless, the finding that humans have the potential to make potent bNAbs has spurred intensive research to identify the target epitopes of these antibodies and their developmental pathways from unmutated germline B cell receptor (BCR) to mature bNAb. Recently, research has focused on the coevolutionary pathways of bNAbs and HIV-1 Env sequences that elicit them in hopes of inferring particular Env sequences that can be developed into immunogens that engage and stimulate germline and intermediate ancestor BCRs. This strategy has been championed by investigators pursuing both ?B cell lineage design? and ?reverse vaccinology? approaches to vaccine development. We propose that a major roadblock to rational HIV- 1 vaccine design is the lack of an animal model where the induction of bNAbs can be achieved in a consistent and reproducible manner such that the molecular events responsible for bNAb elicitation can be deciphered and used to guide iterative HIV-1 vaccine design. This HIVRAD application proposes a novel hypothesis and an integrated research plan ? supported by promising new discoveries in SHIV biology, virus-Ab coevolution, and B lineage vaccine design ? to overcome this critical roadblock. We hypothesize that: (i) primary HIV-1 Env glycoproteins, if presented in their native conformation as persistently replicating SHIVs to outbred, genetically diverse rhesus macaques (RMs), will lead to consistent patterns of virus-Ab coevolution that recapitulate those patterns observed in humans infected by HIV-1 strains bearing homologous Envs; (ii) SHIVs containing primary HIV-1 Envs that in humans elicited bNabs, will bind orthologous germline and intermediate ancestor BCRs in RMs, and lead to the development of autologous and heterologous tier 2 neutralizing antibodies; and (iii) by identifying RM germline and intermediate ancestor BCRs that evolve to achieve neutralization breadth, together with their cognate SHIV Env immunogens (?immunotypes?), we will have in hand for the first time a reproducible experimental system in which to iteratively design, test and guide the development of novel vaccine candidates based on both B lineage design and reverse vaccinology platforms. To test this hypothesis, we propose three highly inter-related research projects and three cores: Project 1 - Env Evolution and Neutralizing Antibody Elicitation in SHIV Infected Rhesus Macaques and in Humans Infected by HIV-1 Strains bearing Homologous Envs (Shaw); Project 2 - Population Dynamics of Neutralizing B-Cell Responses in SHIV- infected Macaques (Kelsoe); Project 3 - Immunogen Design of HIV Sequential Envelopes Derived from SHIV- infected Macaques (Haynes). These projects will be enabled by Core A - Administrative (Shaw); Core B - Viral and Antibody Gene Sequencing (Hahn); and Core C - Bioinformatics and Statistics (Korber)."
"9206501","?    DESCRIPTION:  Micellar nanoparticles that mimic the size and shape of viral particles are attractive as a DNA delivery vehicle because of their improved colloidal stability and transport properties, ability to evade immune clearance, and high payload packaging capacity. Moreover, nanoparticle shape has explicitly been identified as an important factor determining their transport properties and delivery efficiency. However, there is no available nanoparticle synthesis method for packaging plasmid DNA payloads while allowing sufficient control over particle size and shape. Recently, we have shown that distinct shape control and tuning for DNA micelles can be achieved through complexation of plasmid DNA with engineered block or graft copolymers of polycation and poly (ethylene glycol) under controlled assembly conditions. In this proposed study, we will develop a synergistic research program comprising parallel and integrated experimental and computational strategies to (1) develop and understand new methods for DNA micelle assembly that permit scalable, high-uniformity synthesis with shape control and high stability; (2) reveal shape-dependent nanoparticle diffusion and transport properties in physiologically media in vitro and in vivo; and (3) demonstrate the delivery efficiency of a theranostic vector by shape-controlled DNA micelles and their imaging and therapeutic efficacy using mouse models of human metastatic cancers. The proposed study brings together a unique combination of expertise in DNA nanoparticle assembly, microfluidics-based single-particle analysis/fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, in vivo imaging, cancer theranostics, and computer simulations to address a crucial knowledge gap in the engineering and delivery of DNA nano-therapeutics. It will not only offer a new, generalizable method for synthesizing shape-controlled DNA micelles, but also provide a mechanistic understanding of shape- dependent transport properties of nanoparticles. Moreover, the integrated nature of our experimental and computational approach establishes a new paradigm that will greatly accelerate the discovery and development of new DNA nanoparticle systems for efficient gene medicine delivery."
"9394276","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal will support the candidate's career goals of studying PKD (polycystic kidney disease) calcium channels proposed to be present in the primary cilia of kidney collecting duct cells and their inactivation by internal calcium (Ca2+) The candidate has developed and published two innovative techniques to measure ion channel events in the primary cilium, which distinguishes his research from others in the field. First, the candidate developed electrophysiology methods that measure the membrane potential of the cilia compartment and ionic flux across the membrane. Second, the candidate applied a genetically encoded ratiometric Ca-sensor to detect calcium changes within the cilium. The candidate has demonstrated the effectiveness of these methods, identifying the PKD1-L1/2-L1 ion channel present in the primary cilium of non- renal cells. For the duration of the K99/R00 grant, the candidate proposes to apply these methods to the primary cilia of kidney cells to determine the genetic identify the ion channels present. Although the candidate is training in a laboratory with FRET experience, the candidate will take on additional training in FRET experimentation and analysis to be applied in the following aim. The candidate will use the FRET methods in conjunction with electrophysiology to dissect the molecular mechanisms by which Ca2+ inactivates PKD channels. The candidate will use this project to lay the groundwork for his long-term goal of identifying genes, such as Pkd, which result in the development of polycystic kidney diseases. During the latter phase of the K99 period the candidate will train in genomic and bioinformatic methods necessary for isolating heritable genetic factors that may lead to the development of polycystic disease. In conjunction with the tools he has developed and additional training, the candidate will have a wide range of methods to identify and determine the function of potential genes which may alter the ion channel within the primary cilium. The candidate is well-qualified to carry out the short- and long-term goals described above. He has over ten years of experience in ion channel biology, has spent considerable effort learning and developing methods to study the primary cilium. If awarded, the candidate plans on finding a tenured faculty position in an environment supported by experts in cellular physiology and genetic approaches."
"9295064","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schools in low-income urban communities present a context with great potential for the implementation of psychosocial evidence-based practices (EBPs). Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an EBP that has been found to be very effective in treating anxiety in various community settings, including schools. Friends for Life (FRIENDS) are an efficacious group CBT protocol for anxiety. Unfortunately, EBPs for anxiety are seldom employed in under-resourced urban schools, because treatment protocols are not tailored to the context or the population, existing behavioral health staff does not receive adequate training or support to allow them to implement the treatment with fidelity, and school districts do not have the resources to contract outside providers or consultants. In our prior work, we developed a more culturally sensitive, focused, and feasible CBT for anxiety protocol (adapted FRIENDS). The adapted protocol (aFRIENDS) addresses one of the major barriers to implementation (intervention context fit). Community mental health agency therapists who provide services in schools usually receive some training in EBPs but typically lack access to adequate support, such as clinical supervision, which is necessary for maintaining treatment fidelity. Two important questions regarding dissemination and implementation (D&I) of EBPs are: a) Can publicly funded mental health therapists in urban schools successfully implement EBPs when supported by their own agencies or does successful implementation require external, expert support? b) What is the comparative cost effectiveness of these two different implementation strategies? The aim of this five-year study is to conduct a 3-arm, parallel group, Type 2 hybrid effectiveness- implementation trial in 18 K-8 schools. Therapists and supervisors will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions: a) FRIENDS with Train-the-Trainer implementation strategy (i.e., Masters-level supervisors receive training from experts on conducting supervision); b) aFRIENDS with Train-the-Trainer strategy; c) aFRIENDS with Train-the-Trainer Plus strategy (i.e., supervisors receive training and consultation from experts on conducting supervision). We will also assess cost-effectiveness and mediators and moderators of implementation strategies on fidelity. Ninety therapists (30 per arm), 18 agency supervisors (6 per arm) and 360 children (120 per arm) will participate. Our guiding framework is the Interactive Systems Framework for Dissemination and Implementation. Therapists and supervisors will use GoToMeeting and SIMULATIONiQ Counseling TM, a cloud-based, HIPAA- compliant system for training mental health workers."
"9378834","The Wistar Institute Cancer Center has undergone transformative changes during the last budget period that reconfigured every administrative, scientific and educational segment of the organization. Coinciding with the recruitment of Dr. Altieri as the first, dedicated Director of the Cancer Center, an inclusive, transparent and highly consultative strategic planning process was completed in the last budget period. Emerging from the 2012 Cancer Center Strategic Plan was a unifying vision to conquer cancer through outstanding research, education and partnership and an underlying mission to merge basic, translational and patient-oriented cancer research in a single scientific continuum. The stepwise but decisive implementation of the new strategic directives during the last budget period established a new administrative and decision-making infrastructure of the Cancer Center, comprehensively realigned scientific Programs for optimal research impact and synergistic collaboration, and reorganized Shared Resources as financially-sustainable engines of Wistar discoveries. To enable the vision of the Cancer Center in translational and patient-oriented cancer research, multidisciplinary, inter-programmatic initiatives were launched in the areas of melanoma and ovarian cancer, and unique inter-institutional agreements were established with regional health systems for access to clinically-annotated, primary patient specimens. Training the next generation of cancer scientists became a strategic priority, fulfilled with the launch of a new, Wistar-based graduate program in cancer biology and the deployment of expansive mentoring and career development tools for junior faculty. Against this backdrop, the Cancer Center successfully recruited nine new faculty members at all academic ranks, many of them research leaders, during the last budget cycle, grew its National Cancer Institute (NCI) funding base by 21% from $8.1 million in 2008 to $10.2 million in 2013, and expanded its collaborative publications from an average of 9.7% in 2008 to 29.3% in 2013 across all three scientific Programs. The extraordinary growth of the past budget period, increased cancer focus, refinement of scientific themes and highly collaborative environment have now placed the Cancer Center on a steep upward trajectory, ideally suited to leverage the opening of a new, $102 million, seven story tall, Wistar Research Tower scheduled for the summer of 2014. Providing for the largest faculty and facility expansion of Wistar in forty years, the new Tbiver will enable the further development of focused and multidisciplinary flagship research themes in each Program along the continuum of basic, translational and patient-oriented cancer research."
"9307427","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Very little is known about the potential role of the gut microbiome in the enduring and prevalent conse- quences of chemotherapy on the brain and behavior (e.g., cognitive impairments). The long-term goal for this work is to determine how to manipulate the mechanisms underlying debilitating behavioral sequelae due to cancer treatments for preventative or therapeutic results. This R01 project is our response to NCI Provocative Question #10: How do microbiota affect the response to cancer therapies? The overall objective of this work is to determine the role of gut microbiome-brain interactions in chemotherapy-related cognitive problems. The central hypothesis for this project is that chemotherapy shifts diversity in the gut microbiota, which leads to neuroinflammation and cognitive impairments. Thus, the rationale for this work is that understanding how can- cer treatment alters brain function via the gut microbiome will elucidate novel, more effective, and non-invasive targets of intervention to improve quality of life in this rapidly-growing population. Four specific aims are pro- posed to test the central hypothesis using both a non-metastatic mouse model of breast cancer and breast cancer patients. Aim 1 is to determine the role of chemotherapy-induced changes in the gut microbiome on behavior. Using our mouse cancer model, we will study the relationship between learning and memory behav- ior and gut microbial sequence diversity with chemotherapy treatment. Aim 2 will identify the necessi- ty/sufficiency of changes in the gut microbiome on chemotherapy-induced behaviors. Our approach for this aim is to directly manipulate the gut microbiome in this mouse model through either the use of microbe-free mice or probiotic treatment. Aim 3 is designed to identify the role of the gut microbiome in chemotherapy-induced neu- ral alterations relevant to cognition. Using brain tissue from the prior gut manipulations, cellular and molecular neurobiological approaches will be taken to pinpoint the effects of the gut microbiome on brain pathways that regulate cognition in the context of cancer/chemotherapy. Finally, Aim 4 is an exploratory clinical aim for the translation of this work into a chemotherapy-treated breast cancer population. Here, we will determine the clini- cal longitudinal relationship between the consequences of chemotherapy on the gut microbiome and behavior- al comorbidities. The contribution of this work will be significant because it will launch the discussion of har- nessing gut-brain interactions for the treatment and understanding of behavioral comorbidities common to can- cer and other chronic diseases. The proposed research is innovative because it is an evolved and substantial departure from the existing approaches to the chemobrain problem based on new transformative research on gut-brain communication. Our team and environment at Ohio State University is uniquely positioned to carry out this combined translational and clinical approach for this high-priority and innovative research endeavor. The PI is a New and Early Investigator."

"9367539","Limited English proficient (LEP) patients who struggle to understand their care providers report difficulty navigating both administrative and clinical procedures, leading to poorer outcomes than their English-proficient counterparts. Despite numerous federal and state mandates requiring adequate language assistance, healthcare organizations have had limited success in implementing appropriate services. Facing a shortage of certified medical interpreters, hospitals frequently utilize ad hoc or ?dual role? interpreters, many of whom are bilingual staff with self-reported medical fluency. While convenient and sometimes unavoidable, such ad hoc interpreters are more likely to make critical translation errors that can potentially lead to preventable clinical complications; in fact, it has been found that 20% of dual role interpreters are unfit to perform medical interpretation. Despite the increasing reliance on personnel with self-reported bilingual fluency to deliver critical health information to vulnerable patient populations, there is no rigorous and scalable method for assessing bilingual communicative competence in healthcare. This deficit not only renders improvements upon language services difficult, but also deprives qualified bilingual personnel the due recognition and career-advancing credentials they deserve for their skills. This Topical Assessment of Language Knowledge (TALK) initiative aims to deliver a comprehensive support ecosystem for the bilingual healthcare workforce, consisting of a medical bilingual proficiency exam, a scorer workflow management portal, and a searchable directory of credentialed bilingual healthcare personnel. Further, based on proficiency exam results, TALK will offer recommendations for additional language training matched to a test-taker's areas of weakness, creating a mechanism for continued improvement of their valuable skillset. This systematic approach will provide the necessary support for fostering standardization, increased transparency, and quality assurance in instances of bilingual medical communication. The effectiveness of this approach will be evaluated through implementation with administrators, healthcare workers, assessment test scorers, and other pertinent stakeholders."
"9320012","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The reinforcing properties of addictive drugs result from their effects on the mesolimbic dopamine system, which projects from the ventral tegmental area to the nucleus accumbens. Dopamine plays a central role in modulating glutamatergic inputs to medium spiny neurons, the major output neuron of the nucleus accumbens. It was recently shown that dopamine neurons release glutamate in the nucleus accumbens, in addition to their canonical release of dopamine. Since glutamate transmission in the nucleus accumbens is altered in response to chronic exposure to drugs of abuse, it is critical to understand how the release of glutamate from dopamine terminals is regulated. Previous work examining corelease used electrophysiology to measure glutamate- mediated postsynaptic currents and electrochemistry to measure the extracellular concentration of dopamine. However, it is unclear whether the extracellular dopamine measured with electrochemistry is the same pool of dopamine that drives activation of synaptic dopamine receptors. We recently described a new approach to measure synaptic dopamine transmission using overexpression of a G-protein activated inward rectifier potassium (GIRK) channel. Since endogenous D2-receptors efficiently couple to these GIRK channels, the outward potassium current can be used as a sensor of D2-receptor activation. Thus for the first time, it will be possible to measure dopamine- and glutamate-mediated postsynaptic currents resulting from simultaneous release of the two transmitters from dopamine terminals. The goal of this proposal is to determine the functional organization of dopamine and glutamate cotransmission in the nucleus accumbens. Aim 1 will examine whether dopamine and glutamate can be stored in separate pools of vesicles by determining whether dopamine- and glutamate-mediated postsynaptic currents are differentially regulated. Aim 2 will assess whether dopamine and glutamate are capable of being stored in the same synaptic vesicles by pharmacologically and genetically manipulating the activity of vesicular neurotransmitter transporters. Technical training in this proposal will inclue learning to record and analyze rapid excitatory postsynaptic currents, learning to perform fast scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) to measure the concentration of extracellular dopamine, learning to combine FSCV with electrophysiology in simultaneous recordings, and continuing to develop skills required to maintain a colony of transgenic mice. Overall, this proposal will test the hypothesis that dopamine and glutamate, while they may be predominantly segregated to different pools of vesicles, can be released from the same synaptic vesicles in dopamine terminals in the nucleus accumbens. This will add to our understanding of how dopamine neurons are capable of transmitting heterogeneous signals to postsynaptic targets."
"9438451","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study will identify the role of a Poly (ADP-ribose) polymer (PAR)-dependent pathological process in stroke that we believe is a central pathway to induce bioenergetic defects, oxidative stress and mitochondrial permeability transition in stroke. Stroke remains a major cause of mortality and morbidity in United States and worldwide and lacks effective therapeutic innervations. There is a critical need to identify the molecular pathways of cell death in stroke so that novel therapeutic targets can be identified.  Excessive activation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) activation is strongly implicated to induce cell death in stroke. Studies have shown that PAR is a death signaling molecule in PARP-1 activation and that binding of PAR to hexokinase (HK-1) may cause bioenergetic collapse. However, the role of this PAR/HK-1 interaction in stroke is not known. HK-1 is an essential enzyme in the brain to regulate cellular bioenergetics via glycolysis and mitochondrial function, and maintains redox homeostasis via pentose phosphate pathway. In addition, protection of mitochondria against permeability transition is an important function of HK-1 in the brain. Preliminary data in this application supports the view that in cortical neurons exposed to OGD (an in vitro ischemia / stroke model), PAR binds HK-1 and alters its functions. Collapse of the HK-1 dependent cell survival functions namely bioenergetic balance, redox homeostasis and mitochondrial membrane protection are well known to induce cell death in stroke. Therefore, it is conceivable that binding of PAR to HK-1 is a central pathological pathway to induce cell death in stroke and therefore, may be a credible target for therapeutic intervention in stroke. To directly and rigorously identify the role of this novel pathway in stroke, we will use viral-mediated knockdown of endogenous HK-1 and replacement with PAR-binding mutant form of HK-1 (pbmHK-1) in combination with OGD in neuronal cultures and an MCAO model of stroke in adult mice. We propose the following 4 aims: Aim #1: Does PAR-dependent inhibition of HK-1 mediate bioenergetic defects in OGD-treated neurons? Aim #2: Are oxidative stress and redox imbalance in OGD-subjected neurons the consequence of PAR/HK-1 interaction? Aim # 3: Does PAR-binding to HK-1 lead to mitochondrial permeability transition after OGD in neurons? Aim # 4: What is the role of PAR-binding to HK-1 on cell death in stroke in vivo?  Each of the proposed aims are supported by a set of important preliminary data, which strongly support the hypothesis that PAR to HK-1 is a central pathological process to induce cell death in stroke. Combining viral-mediated expression of pbmHK-1 with Seahorse Flux analysis, metabolic tracer studies, live-cell imaging and biochemical analysis in experimental models of stroke represent a novel approach to understand PAR- dependent cell death signaling in stroke in greater depth. These studies are crucial to further reveal the role of this novel HK-1/PAR pathway in stroke and to determine whether this important pathological pathway is a credible target for therapeutic intervention in stroke."
"9345635","Over 20 million women suffer from urinary tract infections (UTI) annually in the U.S., and 25-35% of these patients will suffer from recurrent infections, including approximately 900,000 patients, mostly women, who will suffer from highly recurrent (greater than 3 episodes per year) UTI. Antimicrobial treatment of UTIs has resulted in increasing antimicrobial resistance among uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) to first-line empiric therapies, such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and even to broad-spectrum fluoroquinolones. Those with frequent recurrent UTI must often resort to long-term prophylactic antimicrobial therapy, which in turn selects for more resistance. Alternative treatment options are desperately needed. Over the past two decades, elucidation of bacterial pathogenic pathways in UPEC has revealed that the mannose-binding tip adhesin protein of type 1 pili, FimH, is an essential virulence factor, and thus a novel therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of UTI. With this knowledge, investigators have identified and developed ?-D- mannose derivatives, called ?mannosides,? as FimH antagonists that are efficacious in blocking FimH function, including the abilities of FimH to mediate biofilm formation and UPEC adherence to mannosylated receptors on bladder epithelial cells. Using an interdisciplinary approach that blends medicinal chemistry, microbiology, and pharmacology, much progress has been made to optimize these potent, orally available mannosides that attenuate acute virulence, and treat existing infections in established murine models of UTI. Importantly, mannosides are effective at treating antimicrobial-resistant clinical strains, including an ST131 ESBL ?Superbug? strain, in vivo. Mannosides can even potentiate therapy with an antimicrobial that UPEC are otherwise clinically resistant to, by preventing bacterial invasion into host tissue, thereby exposing UPEC to host immune responses and high levels of first-line antimicrobials that concentrate in the urine. This proposal is focused on continuing the lead optimization of mannosides from the Phase I SBIR project to identify a clinical candidate drug for human clinical trials of UTI therapy. Development efforts will focus on the optimization of C- linked mannosides and O-mannoside pro-drugs with improved drug-like properties, including increased metabolic stability and bioavailability. In vitro biological assays will be used to screen our lead candidates for potency. The in vivo pharmacokinetics (PK) and efficacy of our best lead mannoside FimH antagonists will then be evaluated in mice. Our models are relevant to human UTI, and allow evaluation of mannosides for prevention and treatment of acute, recurrent and chronic UTI. Together with separate, but complementary, preclinical studies funded by our industry partner, our proposed experiments will allow us to identify a clinical candidate mannoside drug to move forward to investigational new drug (IND) status. The ultimate goal of this project is to deliver a first-in-class anti-virulence FimH mannoside antagonist drug into human clinical trials, as a new oral antimicrobial-sparing therapeutic for millions of women suffering from UTIs."
"9252226","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Addiction is a chronic, relapsing, debilitating condition for which few treatments are available. All addictive substances act by increasing release or impairing reuptake of dopamine (DA) by neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Understanding the molecular determinants of DA neuron firing rate, and its plasticity in response to drugs of abuse, is therefore crucial to the development of therapies for addiction. G protein gated inward rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels conduct a hyperpolarizing current that reduces DA neuron firing rate, but their expression is reduced 24 hours after exposure to psychostimulants. Our lab has identified sorting nexin 27 (SNX27) as an important positive regulator of GIRK channel expression in vivo. Selective deletion of SNX27 from DA neurons (SNX27DAKO) led to reduced GIRK currents and increased acute locomotor response to cocaine. However, the effect of SNX27 on the pathological learning underlying addiction, as well as the subcellular mechanism and circuit-level specificity of SNX27 regulation of GIRK channels, are unknown. The present proposal addresses these questions using an array of behavioral, electrophysiological and molecular techniques. In Aim 1, the effect of SNX27 on pathological learning underlying addiction will be measured using several behavioral tests including conditioned place preference (CPP) and locomotor sensitization with cocaine, and two-bottle choice with methamphetamine. In Aim 2, the subcellular mechanism of SNX27 regulation of GIRK channels will be addressed. It has been shown that SNX27 regulates other targets via interaction with the retromer complex; therefore, conditional knockout mice lacking the retromer protein VPS26 will be bred from existing floxed lines. These mice will be subjected to electrophysiological and behavioral experiments, and are predicted to exhibit the same phenotypes as SNX27DAKO mice. In Aim 3, the circuit-level specificity of SNX27 regulation of GIRK channels will be explored. The VTA contains multiple distinct subpopulations of DA neurons which have different projection targets. Retrograde labeling with viral constructs will be used to selectively label subpopulations of DA neurons in SNX27DAKO mice, and these neurons will be recorded to determine whether SNX27 regulates GIRK channels in these neuronal populations. These experiments will determine the relevance of SNX27 to addiction, the mechanism by which it regulates GIRK channels, and in which VTA neurons it does so. This will increase our understanding of the changes that occur in the VTA in addiction, paving the way for the development of therapies to treat this challenging disorder."

"9265072","The Yale-DRC Clinical Metabolism Core provides comprehensive support for investigators conducting clinical investigations of human diseases of metabolism such as diabetes and obesity. The primary emphasis of this core is to provide analytical resources for patient-oriented studies utilizing stable isotopes to determine metabolic flux at the whole body and tissue specific levels. Secondarily, the core also makes its analytical resources available to researchers utilizing rat and cell models of human metabolic diseases.  Stable isotopes offer unique advantages over traditional radioisotopic methods for assessing substrate turnover in humans as they do not expose subjects to ionizing radiation and they provide positional isotopomer information that can be used to assess flux through critical metabolic pathways. The major limitation to the use of stable isotopes by the clinical investigator is the need for sophisticated and expensive instrumentation and highly skilled expertise for instrument operation and for data analysis and interpretation  The Yale-DRC Clinical Metabolism Core removes these obstacles by providing the personnel and resources needed for the extraction, purification, derivatization, and instrumental analysis needed to determine the concentrations and isotopic enrichments of metabolites in plasma, urine, or tissues. This core measures the isotopic (e.g., [2]H, [13]C, [5]N, and [18] 0) enrichment and concentrations of over 140 intermediary metabolites by  GC-MS, LC-MS/MS, and NMR for the calculation of turnover of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. The primary purposes of the Yale-DRC Clinical Metabolism Core are to: 1) make GC-MS, LC-MS/MS, and NMR analyses available to DRC members, 2) avoid duplication of costs associated with personnel and instrumentation, 3.) provide standardized protocols to insure consistent and accurate sample analysis, and 4) assist Yale-DRC researchers in the design and interpretation of experiments utilizing stable isotopes for measurement of metabolic flux."
"9236173","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The prognosis for pancreatic cancer (PaC) patients is dismal. The application of immunotherapy holds the promise to revolutionize PaC patient outcomes. Unfortunately, attempts at immunotherapy in PaC, to date, have not achieved significant clinical benefits as single agents. This is likely due to the presence of a uniquely suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that is dominant in most pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC). Two major drivers of this tumor protective microenvironment include a dense fibrotic tumor stroma and robust infiltration by tumor-supportive myeloid cells. High stromal density provides a barrier to T cell infiltration and function. These data suggest that we could improve PaC patient outcomes, if we could identify therapeutics that reprogram the protective TME to facilitate immunotherapy. One such approach is to target the oncogenic pathways that induce the fibrotic and suppressive PDAC TME.  Recently, we have identified focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-1, which is hyperactivated in the presence of mutated Kras, as a major driver of the fibrotic and inflammatory (fibro-inflammatory) TME of PDAC tumors. We have discovered that in human PDAC, elevated FAK activity correlates with higher fibrosis levels, excessive myeloid cell infiltration, and poor T cell responses. These data suggest that FAK is a key mediator of the fibro-inflammatory microenvironment that blocks immunotherapeutic efficacy. We have found that FAK inhibition dramatically reduced fibrosis and inflammatory myeloid cell infiltration, and improved T cell function in PaC mouse models. Our hypothesis is that: Reciprocal crosstalk between Kras-mutant pancreatic tumors and stromal cells regulates inflammatory fibrosis and prevents responsiveness to immunotherapy. To test this hypothesis, we will: 1) Determine the mechanisms by which Kras-driven FAK activity regulates fibrosis and local immunosuppression. 2) Determine the impact of stromal FAK signaling on fibrosis and tumor progression. 3) Determine the mechanisms by which FAK blockade improves immunotherapy. Significance: Our preliminary data strongly support the use of FAK inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy and/or checkpoint antagonists in PDAC patients. However, understanding the mechanisms by which FAK signaling in PDAC tumor and stromal cells drive tumor fibrosis and immunosuppression is critical to designing effective clinica trials. Additionally, these studies will contribute to our understanding of how tumor cells and stromal cells crosstalk to generate resistance to immunotherapy. This is a significant gap in our understanding of the immunobiology of PaC, which has thwarted the effectiveness of therapy to date."

"9222779","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating inflammatory bowel disease affecting approximately 10% of premature infants born <1500gm. There is currently no means of predicting, preventing, or specifically treating this disease. The two primary risk factors for NEC are prematurity and bacterial colonization. This proposal is focused on understanding the function of the early intestinal microbiota. Specifically, the goal of this proposal is to elucidate the role of early human microbiota in the development of the immature intestine, and the mechanism by which this microbiota-host interaction alters susceptibility to NEC. Based on preliminary data demonstrating differences in the microbial communities of preterm infants who do or do not develop NEC, and differences in inflammatory signaling and barrier function associated with different preterm infant microbial communities, we hypothesize that optimal early microbial intestinal colonization enhances development of the immature preterm gut and exhibits stability despite clinical perturbations thus protecting against NEC. We propose to investigate the role of early microbial communities in infants who ultimately develop or do not develop NEC by using 1. Metagenomic sequencing to determine differences in functional microbial gene sequence of the overall community; 2. Germ-free mouse transfaunation to investigate the effect of the early microbial community on intestinal phenotype; 3. Chemostat bioreactors to measure the stability of the microbial community and volatile organic compounds (VOC) produced in response to clinically relevant perturbations; 4. Enteroid culture models to investigate mechanistic links between VOCs produced and inflammation or barrier function alterations in immature intestinal epithelial cells. Use of human preterm infant samples will ensure clinical relevance. We also propose to create defined experimental communities (DECs) of cultured organisms that are representative of the early microbiota from infants who do or do not go on to develop NEC. These DECs can form the basis for a potential future microbial ecotherapeutic intervention to optimize microbial colonization patterns in premature infants to promote normal intestinal development and prevent NEC in these vulnerable patients. These studies will also allow assessment of microbial community stability to enable understanding of how clinical interventions early in life are influencing this critical earl microbiota, to prompt informed clinical practice alterations."
"9301769","BRCA1, a well-known tumor suppressor gene, exhibits significant ubiquitin (Ub) ligase activity in concert with BARD1. Although it is known that the BRCA1/BARD1 Ub ligase plays important roles during DNA damage response (DDR), very little is known about the identity of BRCA1/BARD1 cellular targets, how these targets are chosen, and the mechanism by which they are recruited to DNA damage sites. We were the first to demonstrate that BRCA1/BARD1 complex regulates mRNA 3? processing by its interaction with the m factor CstF-50 during DDR. We recently found, to our surprise, that CstF-50 can interact not only with BRCA1/BARD1 but also with some of its substrates, such as RNA polymerase II and histones. Moreover, CstF-50 can also interact with Ub. Importantly, CstF-50 can regulate BRCA1/BARD1-mediated ubiquitination. This is a novel regulatory function for an mRNA 3? processing factor. We hypothesize that the binding of CstF-50 to both BRCA1/BARD1 and its substrates helps in the assembly and/or stabilization of the ubiquitination complex during DDR, resulting in the functional regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression. To further explore this novel phenomenon we propose to determine the molecular mechanism(s) involved in CstF-50? mediated regulation BRCA1/BARD1 Ub ligase activity; and to analyze the effect of CstF- 50/BRCA1/BARD1 ubiquitination complex on chromatin structure/gene expression during DDR. These aims will be tested by using a combination of biochemical, molecular and cell biology approaches. The physiological relevance of the BRCA1/BARD1 ubiquitination pathway is not well understood. The successful completion of this project will give new insights into the mechanisms involved in DDR and lead to fundamental understanding of the role of an RNA processing factor in the context of the Ub pathway and chromatin. Knowledge gained will help us to understand the way in which cells respond to DNA damage, affecting cell death or survival, mutation rates, aging and cancer. This grant will provide research support to a PI from a minority serving institution that is in the unique position of being a woman scientist originally from Latin America."
"9233217","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dopamine (DA) deficiency, caused by DA neuron degeneration, underpins the devastating motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). DA neurons located in the ventral tier of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), are particularly vulnerable, compared to those in the dorsal tier of the SNc or ventral tegmental area (VTA). Why these DA neurons display differential vulnerability remains enigmatic. Understanding the underlying mechanisms would shed light on degeneration as well as potential neuroprotective strategies to mitigate the disease. iPS-derived DA neurons are an important new method for modeling PD. Yet current protocols for generating DA neurons are not designed to generate specific DA subtypes, a critical requisite for modeling selective vulnerability. This gap exists because the molecular heterogeneity of midbrain DA neurons is not well understood. To elucidate the heterogeneity of DA neurons, we have recently used single cell molecular profiling, coupled with anatomical co-labeling studies, and revealed the existence of at least six distinct of DA neuron subtypes in mouse models. Here, we aim to use this knowledge to i. better understand DA neuron diversity in vivo ii. understand mechanisms that may influence the generation of DA neuron subtypes iii. derive and characterize two prominent DA neuronal subtypes, one located in the SNc and one in the VTA, from human iPS cells in a rational manner, and iv. use these DA neuron subtypes to examine selective vulnerability in the context of genetic PD mutations. In Aim1, we will examine how Wnt signaling may influence DA neuron subtype allocation. In Aim 2, having optimized the Wnt regimen, we will next use targeted gene manipulations to derive highly enriched cultures of two specific DA neuron subtypes, and then characterize those subtypes by physiological and transcriptomic approaches. Next, we will generate both DA neuron subtypes from iPS cells harboring a DJ-1 mutation and examine differential pathological effects on both, SNc as well as VTA DA neuron subtypes. In Aim 3, we will further characterize the phenotype of the two DA neuron subtypes in vivo. We will elucidate the projections, and complete transcriptomes of two murine DA neuron subtypes, taking advantage of genetically targeted mice. Information from this aim will further highlight the differences between these subtypes. Additionally, these results will feed back into Aims 1 and 2, to further optimize our DA neuron subtype derivation protocol. In sum, taking advantage of the combined expertise and extensive interactions of two labs, we propose a cohesive plan based on molecular logic, to derive distinct DA neuron subtypes from iPS cells and aim to improve modelling PD. These studies will open the future possibility of understanding the effects of a range of PD mutations on selective vulnerability."
"9230434","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the third leading cause of death in the U.S, is strongly influenced by cigarette smoking and genetic predisposition. The primary objectives of this proposal are to identify functional genetic variants in two COPD genome-wide association (GWAS) loci, HHIP and FAM13A regions, and to define the molecular mechanisms by which these functional variants alter gene expression and cellular phenotypes relevant to COPD. We hypothesize that functional variants in these two loci are regulatory variants that can be measured by quantifying enhancer activity in human bronchial epithelial cells. Furthermore, we hypothesize that functional variants, through differential bindin to specific transcription factors, regulate HHIP or FAM13A gene expression, thus affecting cellular sensitivity to smoke-induced cell injury. To test these hypotheses, in the R21 phase of the project, we will apply recently developed massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) to identify functional variants that show allele-specific enhancer activity in Beas-2B cells exposed to either room air or cigarette smoke (CS), followed by validation in reporter assays. We will also confirm allele- specific open chromatin in primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBE) using FAIRE, and we will assess long-range interactions of identified regulatory elements with the relevant promoters using chromosome conformation capture assays. In the R33 phase of the project, we will determine the role of the functional variants in smoke-induced cell death in both Beas-2B cells and HBE. Subsequently, we will apply an siRNAs library targeting 1529 known human transcription factors (TFs) to identify TFs that bind to the identified enhancer elements with differential affinity to genetic variants (by EMSA and ChIP), alter enhancer activity (using co-transfection and reporter assays), and regulate HHIP or FAM13A expression (by RT-PCR following gene silencing) in Beas-2B cells. To demonstrate the clinical relevance of these mechanistic studies, we will perform in vivo validation in HBE cells from smokers with established COPD vs. smoking controls. Ultimately, these functional characterizations will identify biological pathways with potential therapeutic implications."

"9313536","PROJECT SUMMARY Depression and anxiety are commonly associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), and are often prevalent years before motor impairments upon which clinical diagnosis is made. The circuits and mechanisms underlying PD-related depression are unknown. Mutations in the gene encoding leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most common cause of heritable forms of PD. Disease progression in carriers of LRRK2 mutations, including depression, is similar to idiopathic cases suggesting a common mechanism. LRRK2 is enriched in dorsal striatum, the principal target of dopaminergic neurons that degenerate in PD, but paradoxically, its expression peaks developmentally during synaptogenesis, which may indicate that LRRK2 and PD-related mutant forms affect development of excitatory synaptic circuitry within the striatum. This suggests that altered neural circuit function conferred early in life by Lrrk2 mutation could render circuits vulnerable to PD-related depression and anxiety that manifest later in life. In support of this idea, our preliminary data show that in mice harboring the PD-related Lrrk2-G2019S gain-of-kinase function mutation, there is a significant increase in glutamatergic synaptic currents and abnormal spine morphology in developing striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) by postnatal day 21, a period that follows a burst in corticostriatal synaptogenesis. This is relevant because elevated glutamatergic signaling and spine abnormalities in ventral MSNs mediate elevated susceptibility to stress-induced depression-like behaviors. Consistent with this, we find in preliminary studies that G2019S mutant mice exhibit heightened sensitivity to social defeat stress, a model of stress-induced depression. Accordingly, our objective is to test the hypothesis that a PD-related Lrrk2 mutation that perturbs excitatory circuitry in striatal reward pathways early in life alters susceptibility to pro- depressive phenotypes by young adulthood. We will test this using mouse Lrrk2 knock-in models in an integrated combination of behavioral assays, whole-cell recording and pharmacological (small-molecule LRRK2 inhibitor) interventional approaches in vivo."
"9240585","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The intestinal epithelium is comprised of a single epithelial layer with both absorptive and secretory functions and is  responsible for nutrient absorption. Additionally it is in constant contact with the abundant and diverse indigenous  microbiota that inhabits the intestinal lumen. The epithelium and the microbiota exists in a remarkably stable, bal-  anced symbiosis. This symbiosis is responsible for homeostasis of the intestinal ecosystem, and disturbances in  this relationship has been associated with a wide variety of disease states. While animal models and the use of  germ-free and gnotobiotic mice have led to remarkable advances in our understanding of host-microbial interac-  tions, species-specific differences have made it difficult to study many human enteric pathogens, and suitable in  vitro cell culture models that accurately represent human physiology are severely lacking. We have recently de-  scribed an in vitro system that accurately reflects both the complex cellular makeup and the topological organization  of the human intestine. Using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), we have generated 3-dimensional (3D) intes-  tinal units called Human Intestinal Organoids (HIOs). HIOs contain both intestinal epithelium and mesenchyme  and are comprised of all of the different cell types found in the small intestine. HIOs have already proven to be a  powerful system to study human intestinal development. Our preliminary results demonstrate that HIOs are also an  excellent system to study how enteric pathogens affect the host epithelium. Therefore, the overarching goal of  this project is to determine how specific enteric pathogens and normal microbiota affect the host HIO epithelium at  the cellular and molecular level, and to determine how complex host-microbiota-pathogen relationships are estab-  lished and maintained within the HIO. We propose to 1) investigate how interaction between commensal microbes  and the HIO epithelium affects each partner in this symbiosis, 2) determine how contact pathogens affects the  physiology of the HIO epithelium and 3) determine if contact with commensal microbes will alter the patho-  gen/epithelium interaction. To accomplish these specific aims, we have established a multidisciplinary team that will  examine the complex relationship between the HIO epithelium, the indigenous microbiota and viral and bacterial  enteric pathogens."
"9318987","Engineering Machinery Molecules to Visualize and Reprogram Immunotherapy Abstract Adoptive immunotherapy has the potential to become a paradigm shifting technology for cancer therapy. Specifically, cell based immunotherapy has demonstrated phenomenal success in clinical trials against various malignancies. Although promising, a high degree of precise control of engineered immunocells in targeting tumor cells is needed before the cell-based therapy can become widely adopted. Synthetic biology is an emerging field with the overall goal to understand and manipulate life processes using an engineering approach, particularly molecular engineering. Naturally occurring molecules and domains can be modulated and integrated to produce regulatory modules and molecular machines with well controlled functions. This will allow the engineering of controllable machinery molecules capable of detecting antigens/biomarkers to activate cellular immuno- responses. Biosensors based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) have revolutionized the biomedical research by allowing direct visualization and characterization of molecular activities in live cells. The functionality and efficacy of the machinery molecules as well as their modular components can hence be precisely characterized by FRET biosensors serving as ?digital multimeters? to provide immediate feedbacks for the optimization of the sophisticated machinery molecules. We aim to engineer integrated machinery molecules which can provide a surveillance of the intracellular space, visualizing the spatiotemporal patterns of specific biochemical events and automatically triggering molecular actions to guide immuno-cell functions. We have adopted a modular assembly approach to develop a machinery molecule, specifically for the sensing of intracellular phosphorylation and consequent activation of a tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) Shp2, which plays a critical role in various pathophysiological processes. We have further integrated this machinery molecule to the ?don't eat me? CD47 receptor SIRP? in macrophages such that the engagement of SIRP? and its activation of naturally negative signals will be rewired to turn on a positive Shp2 action to activate the engineered macrophages and facilitate phagocytosis initiated by an anti-gen-targeting antibody and its interaction with Fc? receptors. In this proposal, we plan to apply this strategy to re-engineer macrophages for the eradication of tumors. We choose colon cancer in which cells express a high level of CD47 as our first proof-of-concept target. Two specific aims are accordingly proposed: Specific Aim 1. Characterize the phagocytic efficiency and its associated FRET signals of re-engineered macrophages against colon cancer cells. Specific Aim 2. Examine the efficiency of re-engineered macrophages in eradicating the colon tumors in nude and immunocompetent mouse models. Our platform is designed to be highly modular, with each functional module readily switchable to rewire the molecular network. The platform allows new mode of tumor eradication, with a switchable antibody interface for the eradiation, in principle, any type of tumors. Our engineered macrophage can also be combined with traditional radiotherapy and chemotherapy approaches as well as the immunotherapy antibody methods mitigating the immuno-inhibitory PD-1 and CTLA-4 signals. Vitamin D analog in modulating stromal cells, and the hyaluronic acid (HA) signaling inhibitor PEGPH20 in promoting extracellular matrix (ECM) depletion and tumor vascularity can modulate tumor microenvironment. These existing methods can also be combined together with our engineered macrophage approach to improve the therapeutic efficiency of tumor immunotherapy. Therefore, the success of the proposed approach will revolutionize the ability to perform cell-based immunotherapy and highlight the translational power in bridging the fundamental molecular engineering to clinical medicine."
"9430684","It is estimated more than 500,000 individuals succumb to end stage renal disease annually in sub-Saharan Africa with an additional 50 million people suffering from pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease. Advanced genome-based analysis strategies, such as Mapping by Admixture Linkage Disequilibrium (MALD) in African Americans, have identified a strong association between single gene variants (e.g., MYH9 and AP0L1) and kidney disease. In addition, nearly 20 genetic variants have been linked to childhood onset nephrotic syndrome. Most of these genetic advances in elucidating the etiology of kidney disease have occurred outside sub-Saharan Africa where there is a shortage of genetic experts and the infrastructure for human genomic research is as sparse as the Sahara Desert itself.

"9442883","ABSTRACT Epidemiological and interventional studies have demonstrated an inverse relationship between calcium intake and colon polyp formation. Recent meta-analysis of the calcium chemoprevention literature indicates that the protective effects of calcium extend to colorectal cancer, itself. However, the effects are modest. It has been estimated that a reduction in tumor formation of approximately 8% might be achieved for each 300 mg per day increase in calcium intake (over a baseline of 1000 mg per day). The proposed studies will test the hypothesis that a combination of calcium and a mix of cationic trace elements will be more effective than calcium alone at suppressing the growth of human colonic adenomas (colon polyps). For the proposed studies, we will utilize human colon polyp tissue maintained in enteroid culture. We have developed a culture system to grow the premalignant human colon tissue using a minimally supplemented culture medium containing only epidermal growth factor and pituitary extract as growth promoters. Adenoma tissue in enteroid culture from 21 different cultures (representing 17 subjects) is now ?banked away? as frozen stocks. DNA sequencing and bioinformatic data identifying the presence of mutations thought to influence colon polyp growth are available for each established culture. Phenotypic information (immuno-histochemical marker data) is also available for each of the premalignant tumors. In the proposed studies, enteroid cultures will be maintained under control conditions or exposed to increasing concentrations of calcium ? either alone or in conjunction with additional trace elements. The effects of each intervention will be evaluated over time by assessing phenotypic markers of growth and differentiation. RNA sequencing and proteomic display differences will be used to identify global changes induced by each intervention. The use of colon enteroid cultures provides a way to determine directly if human colon polyp growth can be more effectively modulated by calcium in conjunction with additional trace elements than by calcium alone. By using cultures established from tumors of several different subjects, we are in position to determine the variability in responsiveness to each intervention as a first step toward understanding the basis for variation in response among individuals."
"9401015","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The intestinal epithelium has an exquisite equilibrium between proliferation and differentiation. Two stem cell populations reside in the crypts and are involved in homeostasis and adaptive responses to stressors, such as inflammation (as in inflammatory bowel disease) and tumorigenesis (colorectal cancer, CRC). It is clear there is interplay between aberrations in epithelial homeostasis and tumorigenesis. Recent discoveries of genetic mutations that promote or suppress CRC have guided development of therapeutic strategies, yet CRC deaths remain elevated, suggesting that additional pathways or molecular mediators are involved. This proposal will examine a new pathway that may contribute to CRC initiation or progression, as well as provide new insights into intestinal epithelial homeostasis and barrier function. Igf2-mRNA binding protein 1 (IMP1) is expressed highly during embryonic development and cancer. IMP1 stabilizes mRNAs, including Igf2, cMyc, and Kras. Our group recently demonstrated that overexpression of IMP1 enhances tumor growth, cancer stem cell marker expression, and decreased E-cadherin (important for cell-cell contacts), in CRC xenograft models. We also have novel preliminary data suggesting that modulation of IMP1 in CRC cells alters expression of autophagic proteins. Autophagy is a process by which cells breakdown organelles or intracellular components during situations of stress, such as cellular damage, inflammation, or cancer. Autophagy can be tumor suppressive or oncogenic. The role of IMP1 in modulating autophagy in homeostasis and cancer is unknown. It is also unknown whether IMP1-expressing cells directly initiate tumor formation, or promote progression through direct augmentation of autophagy-, EMT- or cell differentiation-associated pathways. We hypothesize that IMP1 mediates intestinal barrier function and tumorigenesis via modulation of autophagy. We will test this hypothesis through two interrelated Specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will use cell lines and genetic mouse models to define the functional roles of IMP1 and autophagy in normal barrier function and precancerous inflammation. Specifically, we will utilize lentiviral systems to generate Caco-2 cell lines with IMP1 overexpression or knockdown, generate intestinal enteroids from WT; Imp1fl/fl or VillinCre; Imp1fl/fl mice, and induce acute intestinal damage in WT; Imp1fl/fl or VC; Imp1fl/fl mice using dextran sodium sulftate (DSS). All systems will be interrogated for effects on autophagy using Cyto-ID, trans-epithelial resistance measures in cultured cells, and in vivo permeability assays. In Aim 2 we will define the functional roles of  IMP1 and autophagy in tumor initiation and progression. This will be achieved using the AOM/DSS model of inflammation-associated cancer in WT; Imp1fl/fl or VC;Imp1fl/fl mice and the role of IMP1-positive cells in tumor initiation will be assessed by crossing our IMP1 reporter model (Imp1EGFP;DTR;CreER) with Apcflfl mice to examine tumor initiation. In aggregate, these studies will provide new insights into roles of IMP1 in barrier function and tumor initiation/progression. These results will provide a platform for potential translational applications."

"9231360","Category A filoviruses and arenaviruses cause severe and rapidly progressing hemorrhagic fever, for which no specific treatments or vaccines are available. Among the possible pre- and post-exposure treatments vetted, monoclonal antibodies are currently thought to be the most effective, provide the longest window for post-exposure treatment, and be most likely to achieve FDA approval for reasons of safety, availability and efficacy. In the last year, members of our team were first to identify specific antibodies and cocktails of antibodies that confer effective post-exposure protection against Ebola virus and Lassa virus in multiple animal models. We will translate these therapies and fill critical resource gaps in antibodies against other pathogenic filoviruses (Sudan, Marburg and Bundibugyo) and arenaviruses (Lujo, Machupo, Junin, etc.). this proposal describes a large, multidisciplinary consortium from academic and industrial investigators. We have gathered -315 monoclonal antibodies against the filoviruses and -100 monoclonal antibodies against the arenaviruses. These are the largest antibody pools ever assembled for these viruses and include the most potent antibodies known. The consortium includes directors of three BSL4 laboratories - experts in post exposure therapeutic development and evaluation; other leaders in high-throughput and human antibody discovery and analysis with access to unique, large cohorts of human survivors of outbreaks in 2012; structural biologists with intimate knowledge of the filovirus and arenavirus glycoproteins able to map the epitope of nearly every antibody in the pools during the course of the project; and industrial scientists who are experts in large-scale production and evaluation of therapeutics for human use. Our consortium is open to all investigators and to all antibodies they wish to contribute. We will provide a public, comprehensive and definitive analysis of which antibodies are most effective against these antibodies and why, which antibodies can be combined for greatest synergy and why, and which epitopes lead to broad-spectrum reactivity. The over-arching goal is to advance mAb-based immunotherapeutic products to fill the need for treatments against these families of viruses and to file one or more Investigational New Drug applications by year 5."
"9287326","Abstract There is a great need to integrate neuroscientific tools into the study of late-life depression (LLD) etiology. My goal is to develop evidence that will help target prevention strategies to the neurobiological basis of LLD vulnerability. Several existing studies demonstrate that LLD pathophysiology is characterized a high burden of structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) measured small vessel disease, white matter damage, and atrophy in key networks, such as those subserving executive and central visceral controls. To build on and extend current literature, there is a need to clarify the specific structural alterations involved in LLD pathogenesis. There is also a fundamental need for evidence regarding the preventable risk factors for pathological brain structural aging. The conceptual model that underlies my research program proposes that 24-hour sleep-wake activity disturbances are a key and understudied risk factor for the specific brain structural alterations that increase LLD risk. To lead future studies that will programmatically advance the neuroscience of depression prevention, I need to build on my past training in risk factor epidemiology and LLD neurobiology in several areas. First, I need clinical research training in the science of depression prevention for high risk older adults, such as dementia caregivers. Second, I must prepare myself to lead multi-modal, longitudinal neuroimaging studies. Third, I must prepare myself to lead studies assessing and interpreting the health relevance of 24-hour sleep-wake activity measures. Therefore, this K01 will provide me with: (1) A capstone field training experience administering ethical, multidisciplinary clinical research studies with older adults who are at high risk for developing depression, plus mentor-guided training in current LLD prevention approaches and the psychosocial/behavioral basis for LLD in at-risk groups; (2) New technical skills collecting, processing, analyzing, and interpreting multi-modal neuroimaging data, plus formal coursework in neuroanatomy/systems neurobiology, and (3) New technical skills measuring and processing 24-hour sleep-wake activity measures, plus grounding in clinical sleep medicine to interpret these metrics. To accomplish these training goals and advance public health relevant knowledge regarding LLD etiology, I propose to longitudinally study changes in depression among older informal dementia caregivers who are experiencing strain delivering care. This group is increasingly public health relevant and at very high risk for depression. Our preliminary data indicates that LLD in strained dementia caregivers may be due to disrupted brain structural connectivity. Longitudinal neuroimaging studies in this group are needed to extend our preliminary findings by evaluating whether/which specific brain structural characteristics predict future increases in the burden of depression. In addition, dementia caregivers often have inadequate sleep and restricted daytime activity, which are both depression risk factors that may increase the rate of brain structural aging (e.g., by activating pro-inflammatory cascades or contributing to vascular disease). I therefore propose a prospective study (n=90) with state-of-the-art 7- Tesla sMRI and actigraphic sleep-wake activity measures repeated at an initial visit and an 18-month follow- up. This will enable me to test and refine a model wherein specific sleep-wake activity disturbances are associated with brain structural changes affecting the key networks underlying LLD risk. The scientific and career development outcomes will be: (1) identification of the specific brain structural networks and sleep-wake activity patterns that predict increases in depression symptom severity among dementia caregivers, (2) refinement of a model linking specific sleep-wake activity characteristics with both pathological brain structural aging and depression symptoms, and (3) a multidisciplinary research scientist with the knowledge, skills, and data needed to develop a confirmatory study (R01) supporting neurobiologically-informed prevention strategies for LLD."
"9242706","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Oligodendrocytes (OLs) are the cells that myelinate axons in the central nervous system. OL development begins with ventricular zone (VZ) progenitors that give rise to oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), which subsequently proliferate, migrate, and differentiate into mature myelinating OLs. This multistep process requires precise regulation of intracellular signaling. The overall goal of this proposal is to identify cooperating signaling pathways that affect distinct stages of OL development. Using mouse genetics, we found that the intracellular protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp2, a RASopathy gene that has a positive role in the RAS/MAPK pathway, is a key regulator of multiple stages of OL development. Specifically, we found that altering Shp2 phosphatase activity impacts the generation of OPCs and also OL myelination. Interestingly, downstream of Shp2 function, we detect changes in MAPK and WNT signaling. Here we propose to test the hypothesis that altering the balance of Shp2 phosphatase activity results in changes in MAPK and WNT pathway activation that results in abnormal OPC generation and OL myelination. In the first aim, we will test if Shp2 phosphatase activity and/or adaptor function(s), independent of phosphatase activity, are critical in OPC/OLs and determine if the OPC and myelination abnormalities caused by altered Shp2 phosphatase activity impacts animal behaviors. In the second aim, we will identify MAPK pathway dependent and independent roles downstream of Shp2 signaling during OL development. In the third aim, we will identify the role of the WNT pathway in abnormal OL development caused by Shp2 RASopathy mutations. These studies will identify the specific roles of MAPK versus WNT signaling downstream of altered Shp2 function OL development, and provide a new understanding of the complex relationships between multiple signaling pathways during OL development."
"9310854","Project Summary Obesity increases the risk and adverse prognosis of postmenopausal estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer. Paradoxically, although estrogens stimulate breast cancers, risk rises markedly after menopause, when estrogens decrease. After menopause, estradiol falls and estrone is produced largely in fat by aromatase. Obesity women have high estrone, and both obesity and high estrone, but not estradiol, increase ER+ breast cancer risk after menopause. Low intra-tumor levels of enzymes converting estrone into estradiol, and elevation of enzymes that produce estrone both confer worse ER+ breast cancer outcome.  Obesity mediates chronic inflammation through NF-?B driven cytokine expression. We showed contact between invading breast cancer cells and obese adipose tissue induces pro-inflammatory cytokines in both cell types that stimulate cancer stem cells (CSC) and drive metastasis. Our data suggest that cytokine induction after breast fat:cancer cell contact is estrogen:ER dependent, since blocking estrogen synthesis with the aromatase inhibitor, letrozole, reduced cytokine induction upon co-culture. While estradiol is known to oppose NF-?B mediated inflammation, the role of estrone in inflammation is not known and may differ from that of estradiol. We will study how estrone and estradiol, and changes in the ratios thereof before and after- menopause, may influence NF-?B activity and the pro-inflammatory state in obese postmenopausal women.  We hypothesize that increased estrone:estradiol ratio after menopause shifts ER from an NF-?B co- repressor to a co-activator to up-regulate cytokines in obese adipocytes and cancer cells that drive CSC expansion and metastasis. We also posit that enzymes that convert estradiol to estrone may contribute to the poor outcome of ER+ cancers in obesity. Aim 1 will test if estradiol:ER decreases, estrone:ER increases or different estradiol:estrone ratios alter ER effects on NF-?B mediated induction of pro-inflammatory cytokine gene drivers of CSCs in ER+ breast cancer cells. To test in Aim 2 if estrone cooperates with obesity to drive ER+ breast cancer initiation and growth, we will co-culture human ER+ breast cancer cells with mammary adipocytes from women with different body mass index (BMI) +/- aromatase inhibition and test consequences on cytokine levels and CSC. We will also implant syngeneic breast cancers into lean or obese wild-type or aromatase knock-out mice to elucidate if host estrone mediates tumor promoting effects of obesity. Aim 3 will test if overexpression of HSD17B14, that converts estradiol to estrone, increases ER+ breast cancer cytokine expression and CSC in vitro, and increases tumor initiation and metastasis in vivo. We will also compare levels of estradiol/estrone interconversion enzymes in breast adipocytes and cancers from lean, overweight and obese women. A better understanding of the roles of estradiol and estrone may lead to new strategies for breast cancer prevention and treatment, and to changes in hormone replacement therapies. Shifting toward a higher estradiol: estrone ratio in serum or in breast cancer cells may prove to have therapeutic potential."
"9308079","The goals of this project are to define the mechanisms by which oxidative DNA damage regulates telomeric DNA structure, access to telomeric proteins, telomerase activity and telomere length homeostasis. Dysfunctional redox regulation is common among cancers and elevates reactive oxygen species, which generate mutagenic and cytotoxic DNA lesions. Telomere maintenance is essential for genome stability, yet they are highly susceptible to oxidative damage. Most cancers prevent telomere erosion by upregulating telomerase. This enzyme extends the telomeric single-stranded overhang, which can self-fold into stable secondary structures. We will test the hypothesis that oxidative DNA lesions increase the dynamic flexibility in the telomeric overhang thereby altering accessibility and telomerase activity. For this, we developed a single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer detection system that measures structural dynamics in overhang conformation and telomerase extension activity in real time. Using this innovative approach we uncovered several surprising and previously unattainable results. Our preliminary studies show that a single 8- oxoguanine lesion increases the overhang dynamics and accelerates loading of telomeric protein POT1. Consistently, our biochemical studies reveal that an 8-oxoguanine induces robust telomerase activity and processivity on overhangs that are otherwise inaccessible. Aim 1 will define how oxidative lesions impact the telomeric overhang structural diversity, dynamics and accessibility. We will test overhangs with 8-oxoguanine at various positions, along with the most common oxidized thymine lesion, thymine glycol, which imposes a strong block to replication. Aim 2 will examine how oxidative lesions modulate telomerase accessibility and activity. Telomerase activity on overhangs with DNA lesions will be tested in the absence and presence of telomerase processivity factor POT1-TPP1. For aims 1 and 2, complementary biochemical experiments will be performed to validate and interpret the single molecule results. Aim 3 will examine how oxidative lesions modulate telomere length and telomerase recruitment to telomeres in human cells. General oxidative stress will be induced with pro-oxidant conditions, whereas 8-oxoguanine induction at telomeres will be achieved by an innovative fluorogen activated peptide targeting system. Fluorescent in situ hybridization will be used to measure telomere length and to localize telomerase in cells. We will examine telomere length and telomerase recruitment in cells lacking distinct glycosylases that are required to repair specific DNA lesions. These studies will provide crucial insights into how oxidative DNA damage impacts the processing of chromosome end structures. This project will fill a significant void in our understanding of how general oxidative stress and 8- oxoguanine, in particular, alters telomere maintenance. Ultimately, this knowledge will be highly valuable for developing new strategies that 1) preserve telomeres to mitigate the effects of oxidative stress on healthy cells or conversely, that 2) inhibit telomerase in malignant cells to halt proliferation."
"9311260","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The majority of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) ultimately die of progressive disease despite high rates of initial response to novel agents. While complete response (CR) is achievable in a significant subset of patients, most of these individuals relapse as a consequence of minimal residual disease (MRD) defined by occult foci of treatment insensitive tumor cells clones. High dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) improves response, but relapse remains virtually inevitable. No modification to high dose melphalan chemotherapy conditioning regimens has further augmented the impact of ASCT on outcome over the past two decades. Unmodified CD38 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have demonstrated anti-MM tumor cell responses and CD38 antigen targeting with ?-emitter radioimmunotherapy (RIT) can eliminate disease in pre-clinical MM models. In clinical settings however, ?-emitter RIT has been associated with dose limiting toxicity that can prevent dose escalation to levels necessary for elimination of MRD in a substantial proportion of patients. Based on the physical characteristics of ?-emitting radionuclides and new opportunities to harness their potential, there is a compelling rationale for employing ?-emitter RIT to treat MM. The ?-emitter 211At deposits a very large amount of energy (~100 keV/?m) within a few cell diameters (50-90 ?m) resulting in irreparable double strand DNA breaks that overwhelm cellular repair mechanisms. We anticipate that this combination of high energy and short path length will confer a unique capacity to kill individual targeted MM cells and eliminate MRD with minimal radiation damage to surrounding tissues. This proposal will use 211At to functionalize an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody ([211At]OKT10-B10) as part of a novel approach to ASCT conditioning. The goal of this project is to address three hypotheses: 1). [211At]OKT10-B10 will eliminate MRD by selectively targeting all malignant plasma cells irrespective of mutational status, 2). [211At]OKT10-B10 will disrupt the disease permissive milieu found in the bone marrow microenvironment of MM patients and 3) [211At]OKT10-B10 will demonstrate a therapeutic index sufficient to safely sterilize all occult sites of disease. First, we will generate clinical grade [211At]OKT10-B10 necessary to perform patient studies. Second, we will conduct a clinical trial to a) demonstrate that [211At]OKT10-B10 localizes to MM target cells as confirmed by direct measurement of 211At in the bone marrow and alpha camera images of target tissue; and b) evaluate the safely of [211At]OKT10-B10 dose escalation in combination with high dose melphalan. Third, we will assess the impact of [211At]OKT10-B10 on a) stringent complete response rates, b) MRD detected by high throughput next generation sequencing and multi-parameter high sensitivity flow cytometry, c) the bone marrow microenvironment, d) MM cell repopulating potential in a SCID-hu model, and e) double strand DNA injury in target cells. The successful elimination of MRD through the incorporation of [211At]OKT10-B10 into ASCT conditioning could lead to significant improvements in MM patient survival and potentially eradicate disease. "
"9415263","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Excess dietary salt intake is strongly correlated with cardiovascular disease and is regarded as a major contributing factor to the pathogenesis of hypertension. Recent evidence suggests that dietary salt intake acts centrally with other factors to elevate sympathetic nerve activity and arterial blood pressure. Despite recent studies to indicate these effects are mediated by elevations in plasma sodium concentration, the mechanisms by which dietary salt intake or hypernatermia act within the brain to increase sympathetic outflow in salt-sensitive hypertension is not known. Our long-term goal is to identify the neural pathways and cellular mechanism(s) that increase sympathetic nerve activity in salt- sensitive hypertension. The current objective of this application is to identify how changes in dietary salt intake and plasma sodium concentration are sensed by the central nervous system to activate sympathetic circuits to raise arterial blood pressure. The central hypothesis is that increases in plasma sodium concentration activate osmosensitive neurons in the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT) through transient receptor vanilloid or benzamil-sensitive channels. Subsequent activation of downstream pathways through the hypothalamus and ventrolateral medulla increase sympathetic outflow and blood pressure. We also hypothesize the osmosensory transduction pathways are sensitized in salt-sensitive hypertension. Our rationale for this project is that identification of the cellular elements that mediate the intrinsic osmosensitivity of these neurons and how this translates to changes in arterial blood pressure will provide a framework for the development of novel therapeutic treatments. Supported by strong preliminary data, we will test this hypothesis through 3 specific aims: 1) Aim 1 will identify the cellular elements in OVLT neurons that detect changes in plasma osmolality and subsequently regulate sympathetic outflow and arterial blood pressure, 2) Aim 2 will determine whether the discharge responses, basal firing rates, and membrane properties of OVLT neurons is altered in salt- sensitive hypertension, and 3) Aim 3 will identify the cellular mechanisms within OVLT that increase sympathetic outflow and arterial blood pressure in salt-sensitive hypertension. The approach is innovative because these experiments, for the first time, will identify the cellular element in the central nervous system that detects changes in plasma sodium concentration to regulate sympathetic outflow and arterial blood pressure. The proposed research is significant as these findings will provide a platform for the development of novel therapeutic treatments to target neurons outside the blood brain barrier for the treatment of salt-sensitive hypertension and cardiovascular disease."
"9265804","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this renewal application (R01DA033862) is to determine the influence of structural interventions on engagement in risk reduction and health promotion activities among rural Appalachian drug users. Results from the three-year R01 that the investigators seek to continue reveal an ever-changing landscape of prescription drug abuse; an epidemic that is still in its infancy. Unlike many rural and suburban areas, there is little evidence for the transition to heroin abuse. In this cohort, there has been  marked shift from abuse of OxyContin(r) (extended-release oxycodone) to immediate release oxycodone to more recently, buprenorphine and gabapentin-containing products. In addition, rates of HCV prevalence and incidence are high, especially given the population density of rural Appalachia. Given the syndemic of opioid abuse and infectious disease transmission, two structural interventions are particularly relevant to this population of rural people who use drugs (PWUD). Medicaid (MC) expansion (under the Affordable Care Act [ACA]) and syringe access programs (SAP) are two structural interventions that may allow for increased engagement in health promotion among PWUD, but are likely heavily influenced by individual, network, and community-level factors. Utilizing Latkin's Dynamic Social Systems model and leveraging the extant, highly successful cohort of rural PWUD, the aims include: 1) examining how dynamic factors of these structural interventions influence longitudinal trends in illicit and prescription drug abuse; 2) determining the influence of these structural interventions on HIV/HCV incidence and engagement in risk reduction; and 3) assessing the influence of these structural interventions on uptake of substance abuse treatment. This study is highly significant given that understanding the mechanisms by which these specific structural interventions influence health promotion is key to improving public health in rural Appalachia. Substance abuse and HCV are two of the most important, if not the most important health issues facing this region already plagued with marked health disparities. Using innovative measures of network and geospatial risk, as well as conjoint analysis and multilevel longitudinal statistical models, results will not only inform development of interventions that optimize uptake and utilization of risk reduction services such as SAP and substance abuse treatment, but may inform policies surrounding further implementation of health promotion programs in the rural U.S."
"9240562","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): Lower and middle income countries (LMIC) in Africa have the highest burden of HIV disease globally, as well as high rates of alcohol abuse. Alcohol consumption is linked to the HIV cascade at every point, from increasing the risk of acquiring and transmitting HIV, to its dangerous interaction with antiretroviral therapies (ARVs), which may cause premature death. If the spread of HIV is to be stopped in countries facing the highest incidence, alcohol abuse must also be addressed. The concurrent distressed of alcohol and HIV are a particular burden to women and families in LMIC. Families face increased unemployment, injuries and violence, and the increasing alcohol use in women leads to more children born with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). While there are a number of biomedical interventions to prevent HIV and improve HIV linkage to care, the success of these strategies is tied to alcohol use and related social factors.           New tools, such as SMS-based adherence reminders and counseling, mobile rapid diagnostic testing and other innovative social media and technological interventions, hold great promise to help lower the rates of alcohol use, HIV transmission risk, and the HIV treatment cascade. These technologies also improve data informed management of health providers, including community based workers. These potentially game changing resources are largely unavailable in LMIC, especially in Africa. There are a number of challenges LMIC must overcome in the adoption of these new alcohol abuse reduction and HIV prevention strategies: implementation of these interventions requires the support of technological, health sector, and policy level infrastructure that is often missing, or slow to react in LMIC, and the technological expertise to utilize these tools must be paired with deep cultural understanding in order to successfully incorporate them to LMIC communities.           Our proposal addresses these interwoven concerns through a three-year conference series in which alcohol and HIV researchers, innovative health technologists, and LMIC implementation experts (identified in collaboration with NIAAA staff) will come together to develop and diffuse new alcohol and HIV reduction strategies for broad implementation in African LMIC. Given the lifelong consequences on both infants and their families, the conference series will focus on women and children globally. This interdisciplinary, collaborative series will build relationships among researchers who share common challenges, stimulate a research agenda and establish a process to advance the science of cost-effective, scalable alcohol abuse and HIV interventions, and build capacity within LMIC to incorporate new health technologies and innovations into alcohol and HIV research. This series addresses the Office of AIDS Research highest priority: improving implementation of treatments for HIV and a key comorbidity - alcohol use."

We rely on previously collected data of an evaluation of Colorado's quality rating and improvement system, including teacher transcript data that could be linked to preschool children's school- readiness outcomes and to classroom quality. Using ordinary least-squares regression and generalized additive mixed modeling, we will explore: (1) the relationship between specific course content and preschool children's social-emotional and cognitive outcomes; (2) the relationship between specific course content and classroom quality; and (3) whether there are thresholds within coursework categories that are related to differences in classroom quality and children's learning outcomes. The results from this study can inform the development of effective professional development systems and help improve the effectiveness of the ECE workforce at enhancing children's outcomes."
"9235323","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objective of this application is to advance primary prevention of stroke in patients at risk for stroke due to atherosclerosis of the carotid artery.  Four to eight percent of adults have asymptomatic carotid stenosis exceeding 50%. Carotid stenosis is often managed either by endarterectomy or stenting. About 100,000 carotid endarterectomies and 40,000 carotid stenting procedures are done each year in the US. Up to 90% of these procedures are done on asymptomatic patients. Medical therapy has improved. The ACST trial demonstrated that medical management of hyperlipidemia can attenuate the benefits of revascularization in patients with asymptomatic stenosis. Further advances in managing atherosclerotic risk factors may negate benefit that might otherwise be realized through revascularization, making the morbidity of the procedures unjustifiable. Endarterectomy and stenting have also improved. The results for endarterectomy in CREST showed a periprocedural stroke and death rate of 1.4%. For stenting, the rate was the lowest yet reported in a randomized controlled trial, 2.5%, and that rate was improving in the last tertil of enrollment.  We will conduct two parallel randomized, multicenter non-inferiority trials (CREST-2). The primary specific aims will be to compare the effectiveness of intensive medical management to carotid endarterectomy (n=1050) and also to compare the effectiveness of intensive medical management to stenting (n=1050) for patients with high-grade asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. The primary endpoint will be a composite of any stroke or death within 30 days of randomization plus ipsilateral stroke up to 4 years of follow-up. Vascular risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking and hyperlipidemia, will be managed centrally using modern aggressive targets. Should intensive medical management be declared non-inferior to endarterectomy, stenting or both, up to 5,000 periprocedural strokes may be prevented."
"9217550","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An effective malaria vaccine is urgently needed, but progress toward this goal has been hindered by our limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying immunity to malaria and a lack of reliable in vitro correlates of protection. It has recently been shown that protective immunity to malaria can be achieved by experimental infection with viable sporozoites under cover of antimalarial drugs that eradicate blood-stage parasites but allow the pre-erythrocytic parasite stages to develop. This regimen induces CD4 T cells that produce IL-2, TNF?, and IFN? and results in sterile protection from homologous challenge that persists for at least 2 years. In the prior funding period, we tested the hypothesis that chemoprevention coupled with natural exposure to malaria could yield similar protection when given to children in a high endemnicity setting, leveraging a randomized trial of monthly dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) chemoprevention given to young children in Uganda. We found that children highly adherent to monthly DP exhibited sustained protection against naturally occurring malaria strains during one year of follow-up after the intervention ended. Children randomized to DP developed higher frequencies of malaria-specific CD4 T cells co-producing IL-2/TNF?, which were associated with prospective protection, and lower frequencies of CD4 cells co-producing IL10/IFN?, which were associated with increased risk. These data suggest that the functional quality of the CD4 T cell response is influenced by chemoprevention and is a critical determinant of protective immunity. In the renewal period, we wish to more fully characterize the functional, phenotypic, and transcriptional differences in T cell responses associated with protection by leveraging samples and data from a new trial, currently underway, in which pregnant women and their infants are randomized to receive monthly DP chemoprevention during pregnancy and the first 2 years of life. We will assess how chronic malaria antigen exposure impacts both CD4 T cells and V?2+ ?? T cells, a semi-innate lymphocyte population with intrinsic reactivity to malaria antigens. In the first aim, we will characterize CD4 T cell responses associated with protection from malaria in children receiving monthly DP chemoprevention, and determine how the phenotype, function, and transcriptional program of malaria-specific CD4 cells is impacted by chronic malaria antigen exposure. In the second aim, we will determine how malaria exposure impacts the V?9V?2 T cell population, including their frequency, differentiation status, clonotype composition, and expression of activating and inhibitory NK receptors (NKRs). We will also examine the impact of NKR expression on functional responsiveness to malaria antigens. In the third aim, we will measure associations between malaria-specific T cell responses (CD4 and V?9V?2) and protection from P. falciparum parasitemia and symptomatic malaria. These studies will address fundamental gaps in our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying protective immunity to malaria, and could provide a strong public health rationale for implementing malaria chemoprevention during pregnancy or early infancy."
"9311538","Project Summary/Abstract 3q29 deletion syndrome is caused by a recurrent typically de novo 1.6 Mb heterozygous deletion and is associated with a range of neuropsychiatric phenotypes, including mild to moderate intellectual disability, autism, anxiety, and a 40-fold increased risk for schizophrenia. Although the 3q29 deletion is rare (~1 in 30,000 births), its high risk for neuropsychiatric phenotypes coupled with its relatively low complexity (22 genes in the deletion interval) make it ideal for molecular dissection. Investigating the neuronal phenotype caused by 3q29 deletion may reveal a core neurodevelopmental process that is disrupted in schizophrenia, autism, and/or intellectual disability. We propose to assess deletion carriers for behavioral traits along 4 dimensions: cognitive ability, anxiety, autism spectrum, and presence of psychosis or prodromal features. We will also collect blood samples from deletion carriers and related controls and bank these materials in the Rutgers University Cell and DNA Repository (RUCDR) for use by the research community. Finally, we will model the human neuronal phenotype using iPSC lines derived from deletion carriers who have psychosis. This will be the first human neuronal model of the 3q29 deletion. Understanding the specific biological processes disrupted by deletion of the 22 genes in this interval may provide a molecular window into key neurodevelopmental processes relevant to neuropsychiatric phenotypes. All phenotypic data, molecular data, and cell lines will be rapidly shared through NDAR, dbGaP (dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and the NIMH Repository and Genomics Resource (nimhgenetics.org)."
"9251646","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While antigen specific-IgE is important for immunity against intestinal helminths, these pathogens generate high levels of largely non-specific IgE. This hinders the parasite-specific IgE thereby reducing mast cell degranulation and anti-helminth immunity. Thus, this represents a protective response that has evolved for the helminth: non-specific or low affinity IgE blocks high affinity IgE receptors (Fc?RI) and thereby protects the helminth. The initial studies in this proposal indicate that B1 cells are responsible for the large IgE induced by helminth infection, in which cytokines act on B1 cells, promoting IgE production. In this application I further examine B1 B cell IgE production as the source of non-specific IgE in helminth infection, and then investigate the protective capacity of B1 IgE as an explanation for why helminth infection is protective against allergic disease. To this end, I plan to utilize a mouse model with a membrane IgE reporter to track the development of IgE in B1 compartments during helminth infection as well as rounds of division needed to class switch to IgE. I will additionally use a Rag1-/- mice reconstitution model, in which B1 or B2 cell IgE contributions to helminth infection clearance can be examined. I also plan to investigate the role of the cytokine IL-5 as a priming agent for B1 cell IgE production. The class switch recombination patterns of IgE have never been examined in B1 cells. I plan to analyze the switch regions (s), s? to s? for s?1 fragments. This protocol will determine if B1 cells undergoa direct switch from ? to ?, which is typical for low-affinity antibody production. Next, I plan toshow the B1 IgE can block MC degranulation in models of anaphylaxis. Also B1 IgE production will be assessed utilizing the reconstituted RAG-/- mice that are helminth infected and then sensitized to house dust mite (HDM) in a MC-dependent HDM model of mouse asthma. The reduced airway hyper-responsiveness seen with concurrent helminth infection should be diminished in B2 only reconstituted mice without the presence of B1 IgE. Next, I will test the underlying factors  that push B1 cells to IgE in helminth infection. Preliminary evidence indicates that IL-5 may prime B1 cells to switch to IgE, I will expand the B1 cells with IL-5 and compare the IgE production in RAG-/- mice reconstituted with the IL-5 expanded B1 versus B1 from naïve mice. I hypothesize that IL-5 will push B1 cells to IgE production and when these mice are subjected to a HDM asthma model, they will have a decreased response as compared to non-IL-5 primed B1 reconstituted mice."
"9418777","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cardiovascular Sciences Training Program (CSTP) at the University of Chicago provides both pre- doctoral and post-doctoral training. The postdoctoral trainees who participate in the CSTP include both M.D. and Ph.D. trainees. The M.D. trainees are physician scientists most commonly recruited from the Cardiology Fellowship Program at the University of Chicago, and the Ph.D. trainees have received their graduate degrees in diverse areas and seek additional training in the cardiovascular sciences. The CSTP also supports predoctoral training, an element essential to this integrated training program. The postdoctoral training strikes a balance between clinically-trained M.D. fellows who plan careers combining research with clinical medicine, and outstanding Ph.D. fellows who are dedicated to cardiovascular research. The CSTP offers training in six core components: 1) Molecular Cardiology, 2) Genetics/genomics, 3) Development and stem cell biology, 4) Imaging and Translational Biology, 5) Systems Biology, and 6) Vascular & Inflammation. Each of these areas has as its scientific mission furthering our understanding of cardiovascular function in health and disease. To this end, participants in this training program receive didactic, laboratory-based, ethics, and analytic training in order to prepare for careers in cardiovascular research. We propose to continue supporting 3 pre-doctoral and 6 post-doctoral trainees. The range of experience for the post-doctoral trainees ranges from 0 to 6 years of post-doctoral training since M.D. fellows have often completed postgraduate medical training at the time they begin in full time research in the CSTP. In the last training period, we emphasized programs in genetic and genomics reflecting the growth in these fields and their successful application to the cardiovascular sciences. We also enriched training opportunities in regenerative sciences since important advances have been made for cardiac and vascular biology in this area. In this next interval, we have additionally enlisted trainers with accomplishments in systems biology and analysis responding to needs to take better advantage of emerging and existing big data and the expertise on the University of Chicago campus. Systems analysis will be integrated with cardiac genetics and development and regeneration biology, since these topics are critical to define the normal and abnormal function of the heart."
"9338941","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiac failure is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the US with about 5.7 million affected and resulting in 300,000 deaths each year (NHLBI statistics). Although there are a number of treatments available, prevention and treatment of heart failure remain major clinical problems. Cardiac remodeling, which includes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, fibrotic responses and changes in function, can be a detrimental pathologic process that leads to cardiac failure.   Aldosterone antagonists are a major improvement in heart failure treatment that results in 30% decrease in mortality when added to previously optimized therapy. These beneficial effects have led to recognition of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and aldosterone as major independent cardiovascular disease mediator. Our long-term goal is to understand how inflammatory processes and immune cells subtypes participate in cardiac remodeling and how these processes can be altered therapeutically particularly by MR and other myeloid modifiers.   Our recent data show that MR in myeloid cells can act as a Myeloid Modifier altering the phenotype of myeloid cells. Myeloid MR has a critical function in the cardiac inflammatory, hypertrophic and fibrotic response in response to angiotensin II. By understanding the role of MR in these myeloid cells and how the altered myeloid phenotype in myeloid MR knockouts is beneficial, we will be able to define the mechanisms and then be able to manipulate these myeloid cells for further therapeutic benefit.   To accomplish these goals, we will 1) determine the precise alterations in the pathophysiology of cardiac remodeling by MR inactivation in physiologic and genetic models of cardiac remodeling. These studies will include the progression and functional evaluation of the disease models. Physiological relevant models include a model for MI (LAD ligation), chronic hypertension (aortic banding), and a genetic model of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 2) define the alteration in immune myeloid cells during the remodeling and how they participate in the mechanisms of remodeling. This will also involve further testing of the target immune cell type and alteration of the myeloid phenotype by genetic manipulation. 3) test the hypothesis that other myeloid modifiers can alter remodeling in predicted ways based on their ability to alter the inflammatory phenotypes thus supporting the role of these cells and potentially pointing the way to targets for therapeutic intervention."
"9215580","Project Summary/Abstract This Orphan Drug Grant application is for a phase 2 clinical trial of combination therapy with a novel receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor against malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). No efficacious treatment options currently exist in this chemotherapy-resistant fatal disease. This is an investigator-initiated, multicenter, first in man study with preclinical data spanning over seven years which identified MPNST as a specific disease indication for PLX3397 (PLX), a potent and specific RTK inhibitor that inhibits five kinases of the over 200 tested. PLX specifically inhibits CSF1R, c-KIT, and PDGFR? in vitro and in an MPNST xenograft model. We have shown that combination therapy with PLX and sirolimus resulted in sustained tumor growth inhibition and a marked depletion of tumor-associated macrophages and a shift from M2 (tumor promoting) to M1 (tumor inhibiting) macrophages. Therefore, this drug combination, by potently blocking RTKs and by altering tumor macrophage infiltration, represents a novel drug combination for MPNSTs. The phase 1 portion of the phase 1/2 study has been approved by the FDA (IND #125719) and CUMC IRB (#AAAO6059) and has to date enrolled four patients using an adaptive design to identify the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). All three evaluable patients have experienced clinical benefit (1 response and 2 stable disease by RECIST) which includes a patient with MPNST. Two patients have surpassed the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) period and one DLT was observed at dose level 4, which is thought to be disease related in the fourth patient who remains on study. The phase 2 portion of the study, and the focus of this application, will require pre-treatment, on-treatment, and on-progression biopsies in patients treated with the RP2D in hopes to demonstrate efficacy. The goal of the study is to (1) demonstrate a performance free survival benefit, (2) determine the response rate and overall survival, (3) correlate inhibition of target pathways and macrophage infiltration with efficacy, and (4) identify pathways of resistance by determining RTK phosphorylation status and level of macrophage infiltration in tumor samples from patients at time of progression compared to that on-treatment. Proof of efficacy of combination therapy with PLX and sirolimus in MPNST would be invaluable in the treatment of patients with MPNST and lead to improved medical management of this incurable and highly fatal disease."
"9328608","Skeletal muscle weakness is a known contributor to morbidity and mortality in aging and other diseases; however, the underlying mechanisms have not been well defined. It has recently been shown that disruption of circadian rhythms leads to significant weakness. Preliminary data from our lab shows that mice in which Bmal1, a core circadian gene, has been inducibly knocked-out in adult skeletal muscle (iMSBmal1-/-) express an increased amount of a longer spliceform of titin protein than their vehicle-treated counterparts (iMSBmal1+/+). These muscles also display increased variability in sarcomere length, decreases in specific tension, as well as diminished unstimulated baseline tension, a preliminary measure of passive tension. These data lead to my hypothesis that loss of Bmal1 expression in adult skeletal muscle will lead to 1) the increased inclusion of PEVK exons in titin that will contribute to sarcomere length variability and 2) changes in titin spliceform and sarcomere length will be associated with deficits in both the isometric length-tension relationship and elastic properties of this muscle. I will test my novel hypothesis through two aims. Specific Aim 1 will define the splicing changes in titin of iMSBmal1-/- skeletal muscle. RNA-Seq will be used to determine exon inclusion/exclusion in titin of iMSBmal1-/- and iMSBmal1+/+ tibialis anterior muscle. I will also test if changes to the length of the PEVK domain in titin protein account for the increased sarcomere length variability in iMSBmal1-/- skeletal muscle using immunohistochemical techniques combined with deconvoluted confocal microscopy. This aim will define the changes to a key sarcomeric protein, titin, following muscle-specific Bmal1 knockout and links this change to maintaining sarcomere length homogeneity. Specific Aim 2 tests if properties of titin-based skeletal muscle active and passive tension are diminished following Bmal1 knockout. I will perform in situ mechanical experiments to test both the isometric length-tension relationship of the muscle as well as the elasticity of the TA muscle without contractile contributions. I will then relate these measurements to the titin spliceform expressed within the muscle as well as immunohistochemical measurements (i.e., fiber cross-sectional area and fibrosis). These experiments will help determine the effects a loss of Bmal1 in skeletal muscle has on altered titin expression and sarcomere length maintenance with implications for the active length-tension relationship. The findings from this project hold potential to provide insight into a novel finding that the molecular clock helps to maintain skeletal muscle's structure and basic functional properties of the muscle through its control of titin spliceform expression."
"9238606","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a significant public health issue due to its high prevalence (> 2 million Americans) in the general population. AF is a multi-faceted, progressive disease which can increase the risk of death, stroke, and heart failure (HF). HF occurs in 30-40% of AF patients and has major implications for outcome - 25% 5-year mortality rate despite optimal medical therapy. In direct response to these sobering statistics, our proposal promotes a new paradigm for AF management - an aggressive rhythm control in patients with reversible left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) to improve LV function and survival. Our rationale for focusing on catheter ablation of AF is based on several randomized trials, which reported that it restores sinus rhythm more effectively than anti-arrhythmic drugs and with fewer side effects. For clinical decision making in AF patients with AF-induced LVD, the distinction between reversible and irreversible LVD is important to predict which patients will experience improved LV function and survival after catheter ablation. Our proposal seeks to develop a novel MRI method to distinguish between reversible and irreversible LVD in AF patients. Among various imaging biomarkers, cardiac fibrosis, as a marker of adverse structural remodeling, is particularly useful for predicting the outcome. MRI is the only non-invasive test capable of quantifying diffuse cardiac fibrosis using a cardiac T1 mapping pulse sequence. However, standard cardiac T1 mapping has two major limitations for imaging patients in AF: sensitivity to arrhythmia and long scan time. In response to these limitations, we will develop an arrhythmia-insensitive rapid (AIR) cardiac T1 mapping pulse sequence. Our central hypothesis is that the degree of LV functional recovery after restoring sinus rhythm inversely correlates with pre-existing diffuse LV fibrosis burden, which can be quantified accurately and precisely using an AIR cardiac T1 mapping pulse sequence. This hypothesis is supported by our compelling preliminary data from an established canine model with chronic AF which show that AF induces HF and diffuse LV fibrosis despite pharmacologic rate control; and compelling evidence from a previous clinical study which reported that AF ablation improves LV ejection fraction in HF patients under pharmacologic rate control. The specific objectives of our proposal are to develop and evaluate an AIR cardiac T1 mapping pulse sequence (aim 1), evaluate the correlation between MRI and histological measurements of diffuse LV fibrosis burden in established canine models with AF-induced LVD (aim 2), and evaluate the value of pre-existing LV fibrosis for predicting the LV functional recovery following catheter ablation in patients (aim 3). The long-term goal of our proposal is to create a risk stratification system for predicting LV functional improvement after catheter ablation of AF in patients with asymptomatic LVD. By using a risk-stratified approach to AF ablation, our proposal promotes a new paradigm for AF management: an aggressive rhythm control in patients with reversible LVD, which will likely have the highest chance for success and improve survival in this patient population."
"9246588","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Pulmonary alveolar homeostasis is dependent upon balanced airway and tissue surfactant pools. Quantitative and qualitative alterations in alveolar surfactant pools are associated with inflammation and tissue destruction in severe lung diseases including infant respiratory distress syndrome, many forms of acute lung injury and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. Identification of a physiologically-dominant molecular pathway within alveolar epithelial cells that senses and regulates endogenous alveolar surfactant pools, coupled with the ability to pharmacologically modulate it both positively and negatively, would be a major therapeutic advance for patients with lung diseases associated with pulmonary surfactant disorders. Preliminary data supporting this application strongly implicate an alveolar epithelial cell-centric, G protein-dependent pathway driven by GPR116 as a druggable molecular target to modulate endogenous alveolar surfactant pools. We demonstrate that GPR116 is abundantly expressed in human and mouse lung, and pulmonary epithelium-specific deletion of GPR116 in mice results in early and progressive accumulation of alveolar surfactant associated with phospholipid peroxidation, neutrophilia and alveolar remodeling, culminating in respiratory failure. We have identified a novel synthetic peptide that is sufficient to activate G protein-dependent signaling downstream of mouse and human GPR116 in vitro and suppress alveolar surfactant levels in mice in vivo, providing proof-of- concept that GPR116 is a plausible therapeutic target to modulate endogenous alveolar surfactant pools in humans. Our central hypothesis is that epithelial GPR116 regulates alveolar surfactant homeostasis via Gq/11- driven modulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics in alveolar type II cells. Our goal in this projec is to systematically define the signaling pathways by which GPR116 controls surfactant homeostasis using cell-based assays and mouse genetics through completion of three integrated aims. In the first aim, we will test the hypothesis that GPR116-dependent activation of a Gq/G11-PKC?-dependent pathway induces cortical F-actin assembly to suppress surfactant secretion and/or decrease surfactant uptake in alveolar type II cells. In the second aim, we will test the hypothesis that activation of epithelial GPR116 is sufficient to restore surfactant homeostasis in two established mouse models of alveolar surfactant overload, Csf2rb-/- and Sftpd-/- mice. In the third aim, we will test the hypothesis that increased alveolar surfactant pools initiate alveolar macrophage oxidative stress and subsequent alveolar simplification in Gpr116-/- mice. Successful completion of these specific aims will delineate the signaling pathways by which GPR116 senses and regulates surfactant and alveolar homeostasis. The long-term goal of this work is to identify potential therapeutic targets, including GPR116 itself, that will permit modulation of endogenous surfactant levels to treat human lung diseases associated with surfactant dysfunction."
"9393786","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent data indicate that a substantial proportion of adults 65 years of age and older are engaging in unsafe, at-risk drinking, either based on the amount of alcohol they drink or alcohol use combined with other comorbidities or medications. Several brief interventions to address the problem of excessive drinking in the elderly, designed mainly for in-person delivery, most in primary care physicians' offices, have yielded promising results, but these interventions are resource intensive and of limited scalability. And, while additional research has shown that web-based interventions addressing alcohol misuse can be efficacious, these promising interventions have not been specifically developed for, or applied to, the elderly, despite the growing need for interventions for this population who currently comprise over 43 million people. While one may conclude that that older adults are not likely to access an Internet-based site focused on alcohol, data from an open Internet- based alcohol screening and brief intervention found that while younger adults were more likely to access the site, elderly drinkers were significantly more likely to report weekly drinking in excess of recommended limits. Indeed, new research from the PEW Research Center has found that older adults are increasingly using the Internet to find health information. Building on ISA's extensive experience in the development and test of substance abuse prevention and health promotion interventions (including previously developed and tested web-based interventions), the proposed project will develop and test an innovative web-based program - science-based, media-rich, tailored, and easily navigated - designed to reduce at-risk drinking by older adults and the subsequent negative and costly health consequences. To overcome the stigma often associated with alcohol misuse among the elderly, the alcohol misuse prevention will be imbedded within a larger health promotion program designed to improve overall health behaviors related to stress management, healthy eating, and physical activity. Phase I will involve focus groups and the development and feasibility testing of the prototype, along with specific milestones that must met before moving to Phase II. Phase II will involve the full development of the web-based program for older adults followed by a field test of the program, including a randomized controlled trial with older adults. Mather LifeWays, a leader in the development and implementation of innovative programs and services to over 30,000 older adults annually through its residences and community outreach, has enthusiastically agreed to serve as the site for both phases of the project and to work with ISA's Center for Workforce Health to market the completed program."
"9440469","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a renewal application for a 5-year continuation of the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL), which is evaluating the role of vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty acid supplements in the primary prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Evidence for a role of these agents in preventing cancer, CVD, and other diseases remains inconclusive regarding causality and insufficient to inform nutritional recommendations for primary prevention. Appropriately designed randomized trials in general populations are lacking. To fill this knowledge gap, we have been conducting VITAL, a highly innovative, cost-efficient, large-scale, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical tria among 26,000 U.S. men and women without cancer or CVD at baseline, who have been selected only on age (men aged e50 and women aged e55), with an oversampling of blacks (ne5000). In a 2x2 factorial design, participants have been randomized to vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, 2000 IU/d) and marine omega-3 fatty acids (Omacor(R) fish oil, 1 g/d, containing eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] + docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) supplements (or placebos) independently. Contingent on continued funding, the median treatment period will be 5 years. During the first cycle, we have successfully met or surpassed our recruitment goals, enrolled a racially/ethnically diverse cohort, collected baseline blood/DNA samples on >16,000 participants (with plans for follow-up bloods in 6000), and conducted extensive validation studies of the laboratory assays for vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid measurements in the trial. Annual follow-up questionnaires assess treatment compliance (confirmed by blood samples in a subset of participants), side effects, endpoint occurrence, and cancer and vascular risk factors. Self-reported endpoints are confirmed by medical record review by physicians blinded to treatment assignment, and deaths are ascertained through the National Death Index-Plus and other sources. Our archived blood samples allow assessment of effect modification by baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid levels, changes in biomarkers over time, and testing of genetic/biochemical hypotheses. With our scientific colleagues, we have obtained funding for 18 ancillary studies to evaluate the role of these supplements in preventing other chronic diseases (including diabetes, cognitive decline, depression, and autoimmune disorders), and established an in-clinic component for in-depth phenotyping of a subcohort (n=1000). The trial is expected to provide either definitive positive or informative null results for our primary hypotheses and will serve as a national resource for research on the health effects of vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids, with opportunities for extensive collaborations. This is a high-impact trial due to the potential for major clinical and public health implications of the findings."
"9233896","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Influenza virus causes worldwide seasonal infections and occasional pandemics with high mortality rate. Human viruses are known to have a preference for ?2-6 linked sialic acids (NeuAc?2-6Gal), while avian viruses exhibit a preferenc for ?2-3 linked sialic acids (NeuAc?2-3Gal). This difference in receptor specificity is widely considered a major species barrier for transmission of avian viruses in the human population. Although this binary model of receptor specificity has been useful, it belies the true complexity o sialic acid containing glycans on host cells, it has becoming increasingly limiting since recent influenza viruses exhibit mixed specificities that are not distinct from avian viruses using standard assays of assessing receptor specificity. The use of glycan microarrays with dozens of ?2-3 and ?2-6 linked glycans has revealed that influenza viruses exhibit dramatic differences i their ability to recognize individual glycans within those broad groups. However, interpretation of these findings is confounded by the fact that there is little information on the types of glycans that are actually present on human airway epithelium, and whether the relevant glycans are represented on glycan microarrays. To address this gap in knowledge, we intend to 1) analyze the glycan structures on human airway epithelial cells, 2) to build a synthetic library of these glycans for constructing a custom glycan microarray, and 3) to evaluate the specificity of human influenza virus hemagglutinins (HAs) and neuraminidases (NAs) to identify receptor-binding properties that support their ability to transmit in humans. This information will identify recepto determinants on the human airway that are shared by human influenza viruses that transmit in the human population, and shed light on properties of the HA and NA that contribute to pandemic risk of influenza viruses from avian viruses that occasionally infect humans."
"9439898","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Retinogenesis requires a tightly controlled balance of retinal progenitor cell (RPC) proliferation and differentiation. Deregulation of this mechanism often results in profound neuro-developmental disorders or cancer. Our long term goal is to elucidate the transcriptional mechanisms coupling RPC cell cycle regulation to neuronal differentiation. In this proposal, experiments will define the role of the transcriptional regulato Ronin (Thap11) in retinogenesis. Ronin was identified recently as a novel embryonic stem cell (ESC) pluripotency factor, influencing ESC proliferation and growth. Ronin is also expressed throughout the developing brain and retina, but its role in these tissues is unknown. In preliminary studies, we have found that Ronin mutant retinae phenocopy the Cyclin D1 null mice thereby implicating Ronin as a regulator of the cell cycle G1 to S-phase transition. However, analysis of preliminary Ronin retinal ChIP-seq data showed enrichment for mitochondrial genes rather than cell cycle machinery. Recently, mitochondria have emerged as critical regulators of the G1 to S-phase transition in both flies and rodents by promoting Cyclin E activity and entry into S-phase. Therefore, we hypothesize that Ronin influences the RPC cell cycle by directly regulating genes required for proper mitochondrial function and promotion of S-phase entry. To test this hypothesis, we have assembled a team with diverse expertise, to facilitate a synergistic, multi- disciplinary approach using genetic loss- and gain-of-function experiments, metabolic profiling, live retinal microscopy and genomics. Upon completion of this proposal, we expect that we will have identified a new transcriptional mechanism that couples mitochondrial function to cell cycle progression in RPCs. This deeper understanding of the transcriptional regulation of multipotent, proliferative RPCs will ultimately inform efficacious strategies for retinal cell replacement therapies as well as novel cancer drug targets functioning at the interface of mitochondrial bioenergetics and the cell cycle."
"9234492","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The prognosis for pancreatic cancer (PC) patients is dismal, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 6%. This is in part due to the propensity of PC to metastasize prior to disease detection and the resistance of these metastatic tumors to cytotoxic therapies. A significant portion of therapeutic resistance in pancreatic cancers comes from the support of a unique tumor microenvironment. This tumor microenvironment includes significant numbers of infiltrating myeloid cells including tumor-associated macrophages, which exacerbate responses to therapy by inducing immunosuppression and increasing the presence of cancer stem cells. Thus, where clinically feasible reprogramming the immune microenvironment would improve responses to cytotoxic therapy even in resistant tumors. One unique approach to this problem is to target the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R). Previous studies have shown that genetic loss of colony stimulating factor-1, a critical cytokine for the recruitment, survival, and activation of macrophages, can decease the progression of mammary and neuroendocrine pancreatic tumors. Our own work has shown that inhibiting CSF1R can vastly improve responses to chemotherapy and decrease metastatic spread in pancreatic tumor models. We have now extended these observations and demonstrated that CSF1R inhibition 1) rapidly reprograms tumor-infiltrating macrophage responses, 2) decreases the frequency of tumor initiating cells, and 3) leads to recovery of anti-tumor cytotoxic responses by neutrophils and T lymphocytes. In so doing, CSF1R inhibition reprograms the tumor microenvironment to increase responses to chemotherapy and decrease metastatic spread. Thus, our hypothesis is that blockade of CSF1R signaling reprograms the tumor microenvironment to improve responses to chemo- and immunotherapy. The long-term goals of the proposed studies are to initiate new clinical trials testing this approach in metastatic PC. However, in order to inform these trials and test our overall hypothesis the following specific aims are critical. Aim 1: Determine the mechanisms by which macrophages regulate metastatic relapse. Aim 2: Determine the functional role of CSF1R blockade in granulocyte reprogramming. Aim 3: Determine the optimum therapeutic regimen for targeting CSF1R to improve immunotherapy. These Aims form the basis of our proposed studies, which will use a combination of clinically translatable agents and genetic mouse models to: 1) fundamentally understand the biological underpinnings by which myeloid cells regulate chemotherapeutic response. And 2) to identify and validate targets to exploit these biological processes for therapeutic benefit. Thus, this application will develop targeted inhibition of CSF1R as a novel immunotherapeutic agent to improve outcomes for pancreatic cancer patients."
"9299333","Abstract Inheritance is typically associated with the Mendelian transmission of information from parents to offspring by alleles, but empirical data clearly suggest that traits can be acquired from ancestors by mechanisms that do not involve DNA sequence. Information that is non-genetically transmitted includes parental experience, exposure to environmental chemicals, drugs of abuse, and parental mutations and polymorphisms that change the parental environment. Non-genetic inheritance has been observed for a wide range of diseases, including psychiatric disorders. Non-genetic inheritance is not limited to the first generation of the progeny, but can involve the grandchildren and even further generations. While multigenerational transmission of traits is typically believed to be gametic, we previously showed that it can occur iteratively through a somatic mechanism during gestation. We refer to this mode of transmission of behavioral traits as iterative somatic programming. We recently found that multigenerational non-genetic transmission of anxiety and stress traits is associated and perhaps caused by maternal autoimmunity perpetuating from one generation to the next. We hypothesize that maternal autoreactive antibodies cross the placenta and cause inflammation in the offspring, manifesting as anxiety in adulthood. This hypothesis will be tested by interrupting the cycle of iterative programming of offspring anxiety, by mitigating the maternal autoimmunity and/or interfering with the transfer of the maternal autoantibodies to the fetus by various immunological approaches. This mechanistic work may help explain the increased incidence of autism and neuropsychiatric conditions in children of mothers with autoimmune diseases. Taken together, our experiments test a novel mechanism that may contribute to the iterative somatic transmission of pathological behavioral traits, particularly those associated with maternal autoimmunity. In contrast to genetic, somatic inheritance of traits is not inevitable, and therefore could be prevented, once the underlying mechanism is better understood."

The multimedia pieces include high definition video animation of peripheral and central nervous system cells and tissues presented in digital dome planetariums. Shows will also be produced as DVDs, companion video games and interactive media for museum kiosks. Aspects of the stories will be crafted into interactive eBook stories with logic and branching scenarios that teach the user about the fundamental principles and mechanisms of the nervous system. The topics that we plan to develop include, but are not limited, to the following: (1) Pain - something that everyone experiences, but almost no one understands how and where it comes from. (2) Learning and Memory in relationship to both childhood development and healthy insights into the needs of the functioning brain, including sleep. (3) Interactions of the Immune System and the Nervous System. The partnership is realized by the synergistic, coordinated activity of three distinct groups: (A) museums and schools, (B) intellectual partners, (C) production partners. (A) The new project will include the Carnegie Science Center, joined by Winchester Thurston Independent School (enrollment 650) and Pittsburgh Public Schools (enrollment 29,000, nearly 60% African American), as well as special resources like the Science Rocks Mobile Lab (CTSI/CTSA). While complex health and science learning goals are typically studied in middle school, we have found that younger students are very capable of understanding and appreciating the underlying fundamental principles when presented in a manner that is both accessible and meaningful to the child. We believe that building a stronger fundamental understanding of neuroscience early on will dramatically enhance the learning that can be achieved later in middle school. (B) The intellectual and medical partnership include the Clinical and Translational Science Institute at the University of Pittsburgh (a CTSA); Chronic Pain Research Consortium at Duquesne University and the Center for Pain Research, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. Additional colleagues from the Duquesne University School of Education, the Liberal Arts College Department of Multimedia, and the Center for Health Care Ethics will participate. Colleagues from the McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine, University of Pittsburgh will also contribute their expertise. (C) The production partnership includes our staff of multimedia experts and the Entertainment Technology Center, Carnegie Mellon University.

"9329848","In today's obesogenic environment many individuals struggle to regulate caloric intake, which leads to obesity and associated comorbidities (e.g., hypertension, diabetes). The exposure to endogenous (e.g., gustatory cues) and exogenous (e.g., environmental food-paired cues) signals associated with meal intake can, through learning, influence both the regulation and dysregulation of appetite control. As obesity rates continue to rise, there is a critical need to develop effective strategies to combat this epidemic. This includes the elucidation of neurobiological and psychological variables underlying the learned effects that influence eating behaviors. To this end, I propose that the lateral hypothalamus (LH) feeding signal Melanin Concentrating Hormone (MCH) acts as a modulator of predictive regulation and gates associations between anticipatory food cues and reward signals. In doing so, I anticipate that LH MCH neurons will modulate the regulation of blood glucose, and the disruption to appetite control that follows either exposure to intense artificial sweeteners, or environmental cues associated with food. Thus, the proposed research will significantly advance understanding of the psychobiological variables that contribute to: metabolic regulation, weight gain, obesity and metabolic disorders (e.g., diabetes). In the proposed research, I will combine DREADD and optogenetic techniques with sophisticated behavioral and ingestive learning approaches in mice to address two specific aims. In Aim 1, I will examine LH MCH modulation over cephalic responding and the detrimental influences over glucoregulation that occur following prolonged artificial sweetener consumption. In Aim 2, I will examine the psychological mechanisms and neurobiological circuitry underlying LH MCH modulation of overeating in response to environmental food-paired cues."
"9333643","PROJECT DESCRIPTION/ABSTRACT Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) accounts for 90% of the head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed in majority of tumors including OSCC. The over-expressed/over-activated EGFR contributes to cancer progression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EGFR also contributes to tumor metastasis and resistance to chemotherapy and has become one of the major therapeutic targets for OSCC. Endocytosis is a key biological pathway for internalization of ligand activated EGFR, following which it gets routed for lysosomal degradation by the endosomal sorting complex for recruitment and transport (ESCRT) machinery. ESCRT is a key mediator of vesicle trafficking. While vesicle trafficking defects result in poor downregulation of activated EGFR, persistent surface and cellular EGFR expression and signaling is subsequently linked to the development of cancer. Surprisingly, the molecular events associated with ESCRT pathway and EMT are largely unknown. Here, we propose to investigate a previously unknown mechanism that regulates EGFR levels and signaling, EMT, and OSCC growth. We found that 1) depletion of CPAP caused prolonged expression of EGFR and EMT- like phenotype in oral cancer cells; 2) overexpression of CPAP caused the de novo generation of EGFR-positive multivesicular bodies (MVBs), whose biogenesis requires ESCRT and are essential for routing EGFR to lysosomes for degradation and termination of its signaling; and 3) the absence of CPAP resulted in diminished cellular levels of VPS4 protein, an essential ESCRT associated ATPase that is critical for vesicle sorting. These collective observations suggest that CPAP regulates ESCRT pathway and EGFR expression to avoid EMT in OSCC cells. The primary goals of specific aim 1 will be to determine the dynamics of functional interactions between CPAP, VPS4 and EGFR in oral cancer by a) determining the expression levels and functional interaction profiles of CPAP and VPS4 with vesicle trafficking and degradation of EGFR in OSCC cells, and b) studying the dynamics of CPAP, VPS4 and EGFR abundance and activation in normal and OSCC cells that are undergoing EMT. Specific aim 2 to determine if CPAP has a role in preventing EGFR dependent EMT and tumorigenesis in OSCC cells will focus on a) examining the effects of gain- and loss-of CPAP function on VPS4 and EGFR abundance and activity, and growth properties and EMT features and b) determining if gain- and loss-of CPAP has an impact on tumorigenic properties of non-aggressive and aggressive OSCC cells in vivo."
"9313580","PROJECT SUMMARY Studies using human tumor samples have shown MDM2 gene amplification in a variety of human tumor types, most notably, sarcomas.In human tumors, the MDM2 gene is found as part of an amplicon derived from chromosome 12q.14-15. This amplicon frequently also contains the CDK4 and HMGA2 genes. Studies in liposarcoma as well as other tumor types have indicated that most of the genes located between CDK4, HMGA2, and MDM2 often are not found to be amplified. This suggests that they are on three distinct amplicons or there is no selective pressure to retain genes that are found between them. To date, there have only been limited mouse models that address the role of Mdm2 in tumorigenesis. None of these have attempted to specifically model human disease. Inhibitors of the interaction of Mdm2 with p53 have been extensively studied for their potential utility as targeted therapies but such studied have been hampered by the lack of suitable preclinical models. In the studies proposed here, a set of mouse models will be generated that overexpress Mdm2, Cdk4, or Hmga2. These will be used to phenocopy specific human cancers that are associated with MDM2 gene amplification and the 12q amplicon, namely liposarcoma and osteosarcoma. The generation of such mouse models will facilitate elucidating the underlying molecular basis for the oncogenic activity of Mdm2 and the 12q amplicon, as well as provide utility in preclinical testing of novel targeted therapies. It should be emphasized that there is an urgent need for mouse models that mimic Mdm2- and 12q amplicon-driven tumorigenesis in humans for two compelling reasons. First, such models are needed to fully determine the molecular basis for oncogenic activity of Mdm2 and other 12q amplicon genes in order to further design and implement suitable target therapies. Second, such preclinical models are needed to validate already established approaches involving chemical inhibition of the binding of Mdm2 to p53."
"9243190","Age-associated immune defects are considered a primary risk factor for TB, but other factors such as the heightened systemic inflammatory state (inflammaging) observed in elderly individuals have not been previously considered. During infection, airborne Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) is deposited in the lung where it is exposed to different local environments over time. First, M.tb encounters the alveolar space, where it will be in direct contact with Alveolar Lining Fluid (ALF) components, notably surfactant and complement, for an undetermined period. We hypothesize that ALF, containing important innate immune determinants against M.tb infection, is functionally deficient in old age, largely as a result of oxidative stress, which negatively impacts the control of M.tb infection in the lung. ALF is generated, secreted and recycled by alveolar epithelial cells, and is essential for maintaining lung function. Some human ALF components [surfactant proteins A (SP- A) and D (SP-D), homeostatic hydrolytic enzymes (hydrolases), and lipids] are critical elements of the innate immune system during M.tb infection, playing an important role in M.tb-phagocyte encounters. Oxidative stress associated with low grade chronic inflammation that occurs during aging is expected to result in changes in ALF component production and activity. For example, alterations in surfactant lipids are predicted to negatively affect SP-A and SP-D function. We know little about how oxidative stress and low grade inflammation associated with aging impact M.tb infection progression in the lung. This knowledge gap limits our ability to design new approaches for the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines that are effective in the lung. Here we propose to determine the function of ALF components in the elderly human lung, and their impact on the establishment and progression of M.tb infection using in vitro and in vivo approaches. Our proposal is significant and innovative in the field of aging, determining how ALF soluble components in the elderly lung influence M.tb infection and outcome. Our studies are closely linked to Projects 2 & 3 (innate & adaptive responses to M.tb infection in aging, respectively) and synergize with Project 4 (circulating molecular signatures of aging)."

"9360813","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Building computational models is one of the best ways of furthering our understanding of both the normal function of the nervous system and the pathology associated with aging, neural trauma, or disease. Biophysically detailed models provide a framework for integrating data across spatial scales and for exploring hypotheses about the biological mechanisms underlying neuronal and network dynamics. However, as models increase in complexity, additional barriers emerge to the creation, validation, exchange and re-use of models. The NeuroML project aims to address these issues by providing a standard format for describing multiscale models in neuroscience. NeuroML is supported by over 30 tools and databases and is the basis for model exchange at Open Source Brain, where 374 users are collaborating on 57 public modeling projects. In spite of this promising movement toward model sharing in the neuroscience community, it is extremely rare to see a specific, rigorous statement of the criteria used for evaluating models during model development, and multiple models for the same ion channels and neurons are not compared for concordance with the same suite of experimental data. The overall goal of this project is to create a flexible infrastructure for assessing the scope and quality of computational models in neuroscience and to make this information broadly available to the community for a large class of models. Aim 1 focuses on enhancing existing tools to work together seamlessly for validation of NeuroML models against experimental data. Aim 2 concentrates on the development of a dedicated web portal, incorporation of automated model validation into existing model sharing platforms, and the creation of documentation, tutorials, forums and other outreach for promoting uptake and obtaining user feedback. Aim 3 includes testing of the validation tool chain in multiple large-scale neuronal network modeling environments. The proposed activities will build bridges that connect multiple, existing initiatives in support of model development, validation, exchange, selection, and re-use, and will integrate experimental data with modeling efforts for more efficiency, better transparency, and greater impact of computational models in neuroscience research."
"9214356","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy represents a neurological disorder that can manifest in uncontrolled seizures in patients. Microglia are exquisitely sensitive to disruptions i the central nervous system. Since epilepsy is characterized by neuronal hyperactivity activity rooted in excessive glutamate release and ionic imbalance, it is conceivable that microglia may perform functions to reduce neuronal dysfunction and promote neuronal health during the pathology. In our preliminary studies, we have found that microglia respond by robust process extension making increasing contact with neurons during elevated glutamate levels in acute brain slices. Moreover, in three different models of epileptiform activity, microglial processes focus on neuronal dendrites and microglial ablation reduces behavioral seizure scores. Based on our preliminary results, we hypothesize that during increased glutamate levels hyperactive neurons signal to microglia inducing their process extension. Additionally, during hyperactive neuronal activity, microglial processes focus on neuronal elements with a consequence to downregulate such hyperactivity which is critical in limiting behavioral seizure outcome and promoting neuronal survival. We will now test this hypothesis along with the following specific aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the underlying mechanisms behind glutamate-induced microglial process extension elucidating the neuronal receptors initiating and the released chemoattractants mediating the process extension signal. In Aim 2, we will determine the targets of microglial process focus as well as the chemoattractants mediating the response in three models of epileptiform activity in acute brain slices. In Aim 3, we will extend our observations in acute brain slices to in vivo live brain and determine the role of microglia in epilepsy-induced seizure behaviors and neuronal cell death by microglial ablation and genetic deletion of the unique microglial P2Y12 receptor. These studies are the first to investigate the microglial dynamics during acute epilepsy. They will increase our understanding of the mechanisms underlying microglial-neuronal interactions during epileptic activity and the neuroprotective potential of microglia in epilepsy. In addition, the outcome of these studies will provide new data that could inform the development of novel therapies in the treatment of epileptic disorders."

"9319457","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atherosclerosis is the leading cause of death and illness in the United States despite all advances in lipid- lowering drugs and lifestyle changes designed to reduce cholesterol levels. Atherosclerosis is a chronic disease that causes accumulation of plaques in the arterial walls. Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) that migrate from the media after phenotypic switching significantly contribute to atherosclerosis and plaque stability. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for SMC phenotypic modulation in disease development still remain unclear. Consequently, we hypothesize that c-Kit signaling stabilizes the SMC contractile phenotype in arterial walls, which controls the progression of the disease in early atherosclerosis and decreases the risk of plaque rupture in advanced lesions. We support the hypothesis with preliminary studies that demonstrate: 1) the expression of c-Kit in healthy and diseased human and mouse aortas, 2) the role of c-Kit in SMC phenotypic switching, 3) increased systemic atherosclerosis in hyperlipidemic mice with impaired SCF or c-Kit functions, and 4) increased risk for vulnerable plaque rupture in c-Kit deficient mice . We will prove our hypothesis in three specific aims. In aim 1 we propose to test whether c-Kit loss or gain-of-function in SMCs alters atherosclerosis development in hyperlipidemic mice. We will make use of a novel genetically engineered mouse and a newly designed inducible lentivector to inactivate or activate the c-Kit gene in arterial SMCs. In aim 2 we will examine the molecular mechanisms by which c-Kit maintains the contractile phenotype in SMCs. We will use culture cells from c-Kit conditional knockout mice to demonstrate the relevance of the c- Kit/PI3K/Akt signaling axis and DUSP mediated dephosphorylation of MAPK in maintaining the transcription of SMC contractile genes. Finally, in aim 3 we will investigate the impact of altering vascular c-Kit signaling in vascular inflammation and atherosclerotic plaque rupture in vivo. We will evaluate spontaneous plaque rupture in HFD fed conditional mice after tamoxifen feeding to inactivate the c-Kit gene in the plaque. Together, these studies will advance our knowledge about the role of c-Kit in atherosclerosis and will furnish new therapeutic targets to prevent and eventually mitigate the devastating effects of atherosclerosis."
"9387711","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to understand the structural basis of CLCA1 activation and its role in airway biology in health and disease, in order to translate this knowledge into treatments for asthma and COPD, a current unmet need. CLCA1 is a potent modulator of calcium-activated chloride channels (CaCCs) and also a central mediator in mucous cell metaplasia, the process that leads to mucus overproduction. In this project we will investigate the structural and biochemical basis of CLCA activation of CaCCs, and investigate the role that CLCA1-mediated channel activation plays in mucous cell metaplasia. In our preliminary results, we demonstrate that CLCA proteins contain a consensus cleavage site that is recognized by a unique zinicin metalloprotease domain located within the N-terminus of CLCA itself. Furthermore, we show that this self- cleavage is required for hCLCA1 to activate CaCCs. These data suggest that CLCA1 is synthesized in a full- length inactive form and that self-cleavage is required to produce an active form of the protein. This project will focus on the structural and biochemical analysis of regulation of the metalloprotease domain activity, since it is necessary to produce the active form. We will then characterize the structura changes that occur upon activation by determining the structures of the full-length inactive and active forms of CLCA1. Finally, we will address the functional role of CLCA1 features in CaCC activation and the role of the channel in mucous cell metaplasia. Understanding how CLCA1 activity is regulated by its own metalloprotease domain and the downstream functional consequences of this regulation will facilitate the design of CLCA1 inhibitors for anti- mucus therapeutics."
"9230875","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Self control is the ability to inhibit self-defeating behavior, failures of which are associated with social conduct disorders, drug addiction, obesity, and criminal behavior. It typically involves resisting temptation- forgoing easy, immediate rewards that lead to suboptimal or negative long-term outcomes. Under natural conditions, self control must be exerted through time, in the face of continuous temptation. The proposed experiments investigate prefrontal mechanisms for this kind of continuous self control using neural recording in behaving monkeys. We developed an oculomotor choice task in which self control must be exerted through time while a faster, suboptimal reward remains available. We will use neural recording to study dynamic, circuit level mechanisms of self control in 3 prefrontal regions: orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), supplementary eye field (SEF), and lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC). We will be testing 3 specific aims: Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that competition between self control and temptation is embodied by dynamically changing value signals in OFC that predict timing of self control failures. OFC is known to encode the subjective value of reward options. We will record simultaneously the neural activity of multiple neurons in OFC of monkeys performing the continuous self control task. We expect that: (a) the activity OFC neurons encoding the temptation reward option will covary inversely, with the activity of OFC neurons encoding the larger, delayed reward option, and (b) the timing of self control failures (choosing the temptation reward) will be predicted by the time at which the ratio of activity between these two neural subpopulations reaches a critical threshold. Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that SEF neurons generate self control signals that bias value representations of specific actions (saccade targets) in OFC. SEF plays a role in controlling oculomotor behavior. We will record simultaneously from neurons in SEF and OFC. We expect that: (a) the activity of SEF neurons associated with the delayed reward target will be functionally linked with OFC value representations, (b) the activity of these neurons will predict self control behavioral outcome, and (c) inactivation by cooling of SEF will bias OFC value representations and behavioral outcomes toward failures of self control. Aim 3: To test the hypothesis that LPFC neurons provide general, longer term control signals that bias self control activity in OFC and predict gradual changes in self control behavior. LPFC is known to encode long-term behavioral goals. We will record simultaneously from neurons in LPFC and OFC. We expect that: (a) the activity of task-related LPFC neurons will exhibit a long term relationship to OFC value representations (extending across multiple trials), (b) the activity of these neurons will predict self control behavioral outcomes, and (c) inactivation by cooling of LPFC will bias OFC value representations and behavioral outcomes toward failures of self control."
"9222649","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Identification of novel pharmacological approaches to reduce pain is critical from public health perspective. One of the most common reasons to seek medical attention is that of pain, and collectively pain represents a huge financial burden to society. Once thought to be only mediated solely by neuronal firing, the immune system has been revealed to play a critical role in the regulation, maintenance and transition from acute to chronic pain states. One class that has broad immune relevance during periods of pain is the prostaglandins. Recent discoveries yield insight on a novel pathway of diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL) involvement in the ultimate formation of arachidonic acid, which can then be transformed into prostaglandins. In vitro work shows that inhibiting DAGL-?, one form of DAGL, reduces the biosynthesis of 2-arachidonyl glycerol, the endocannabinoid ligand and a precursor of arachidonic acid. This reduction in free arachidonic acid in turn, results in decreases in the formation of the prostaglandin PGE2 and the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor- alpha (TNF-?). Therefore, we hypothesize that pharmacological inhibition of DAGL-? with a novel compound, KT109, in mice will lower pro-inflammatory cytokines, prostaglandins and other inflammatory mediators of pain, leading to reversal of behaviors associated with pain. Accordingly, the objectives of this training plan are to characterize the ant-pain effects of DAGL-? inhibitors in murine pain models and determine the underlying in vivo mechanism(s) of action of this class of compounds. The proposed aims to examine these objectives are: 1.) Aim 1: Elucidate the consequences of blocking DAGL- ? in inflammatory pain assays. 2.) Determine the locus of action mediating the pain stimulated and pain depressed behavioral effects of DAGL-? inhibitors in the LPS model of inflammatory pain. 3.) Determine the effects of DAGL-? inhibition on pro-inflammatory and pain mediators. Under these aims the consequences of inhibiting DAGL-? will be investigated in the LPS inflammatory pain model, and the importance of prostaglandins and other pro-inflammatory mediators will be identified. This work aiming to identify a novel mechanism of prostaglandin regulation and subsequent pain control will provide a critical training plan for Dr. Wilkerson to gain the necessary bench skills and conceptual framework to become an independent investigator in developing analgesics that lack abuse potential. Ultimately, the knowledge obtained from this research has the potential to establish DAGL-? as a target linking upstream prostaglandin control to pain relief."
"9212014","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Despite the enrichment of VA suicide prevention services and implementation of the national suicide hotline, Veteran suicide completions have risen to 22 per day and suicide attempts numbered over 15,000 in 2012. These data underscore the urgency of developing additional interventions targeting suicidal Veterans. The construction of a Suicide Safety Plan (SSP); a best practice, is mandated throughout the VA system, and a vital component of the VA's coordinated effort at suicide prevention and recovery. Our pilot data on patterns of SSP use in suicidal Veterans over a 30 day time frame demonstrates that only 65% of Veterans used their safety plans, coping strategies listed on the plan were often mismatched or inadequate to the individual's needs, and limited access to the SSP during times of stress negatively impacted its utility. To our knowledge, there are currently no recommended guidelines or mechanisms for refinement of the SSP in adult populations beyond its initial development. Project Life Force (PLF), a novel suicide safety planning group intervention has been designed to fill this critical gap and provide a mechanism to develop and enhance suicide safety planning over time. PLF, a 12-session, group psychotherapy intervention, combines Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) skill based and psychoeducational approaches, to enhance suicide safety planning development and implementation. Veterans revise their plans over several weeks while learning distress tolerance, emotion regulation, and friendship building/interpersonal skills to incorporate  into their safety plans and also receive lessons on gun safety and minimizing access to lethal means. Sessions are augmented with 1) training in the use of a suicide safety planning mobile App to promote accessibility and maximize implementation, and 2) didactic information to bolster recovery, including fostering improved connection with the treatment team, and Veteran's family. Importantly, the group format mitigates loneliness and fosters increased belongingness, both key risk factors for suicide. Additionally, PLF's weekly format facilitates VA-mandated monitoring for any Veteran placed on the suicide high risk list.  Data from this project will test the intervention's feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy and provid pilot data for a larger randomized clinical trial. The project is comprised of two phases. In Phase  1, we will finalize the PLF intervention and accompanying manual and handouts. In Phase 2, we will conduct an open label trial of PLF in 50 suicidal Veterans to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. We will also test whether PLF affects outcomes of suicide ideation, depression, hopelessness, and outpatient compliance by examining clinically meaningful differences in these measures before and after PLF."
"9237848","PROJECT SUMMARY Low back pain is the second most common cause of doctor visits and intervertebral disc (IVD) herniation is a direct cause of pain. Lumbar discectomy is the standard of care for herniation, yet this very common procedure has 5-25% complication rates including re-herniation and recurrent back pain at the same level. Discectomy complications cannot be further reduced by optimizing the amount of tissue removed during procedures, but instead discectomies require a reparative component to greatly reduce complications. This project develops, optimizes and validates biomaterials that seal the annulus fibrosus and restore nucleus pulposus swelling following discectomy procedures. The first funding period of this grant resulted in 34 papers that developed human and bovine organ culture models of IVD degeneration and determined that methods to repair large IVD defects are lacking and a critical scientific barrier that must be addressed to limit degeneration following IVD herniation and injury. We also developed novel hydrogels with promise to seal the annulus fibrosus, restore nucleus pulposus swelling, and return IVD biomechanical behaviors to the healthy state. Additional acellular biomaterial optimization, modification of biomaterials for use as cell carriers, and pre-clinical evaluations are required before clinical translation. Aim 1 optimizes in situ performance of acellular biomaterials for IVD repair with biomaterial refinements and TGF?3 dose studies using bovine organ culture discectomy models. Aim 2 optimizes in situ performance of biomaterials for mesenchymal stem cell delivery using these same models. Aim 3 validates these IVD repair strategies in pre-clinical human organ culture and sheep in vivo studies. We apply a genipin- crosslinked fibrin hydrogel capable of sealing annulus fibrosus defects without risk of herniation under rigorous biomechanical loading. We also apply a novel carboxymethylcellulose/methylcellulose hydrogel formulation capable of restoring nucleus pulposus swelling and returning IVD biomechanical behaviors to intact conditions. The investigative team closely collaborates with extensive biomaterials, biomechanics, tissue engineering, and spine surgery expertise. All methods are well-established in the labs of this team. This project is highly significant because of the tremendous health burden of IVD herniation and injury, because discectomy procedures are among the most common spine surgery procedures, and because this project has a clear translational trajectory. This project is innovative because it uses novel biomaterial formulations and approaches for discectomy repair that are capable of transforming current surgical interventions and thinking since no IVD repair strategies exist. The approach is robust because it addresses fundamental questions for IVD repair in a systematic manner that allows iterative optimization with evaluation tests that increasingly challenge the repair strategies."
"9266397","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Ultrasound imaging systems require high-voltage (> 100 Vpp) excitation of transducer arrays in the trans- mission mode and low-noise amplification of echo signals in the reception mode. The system is switched back and forth between the transmission and reception modes during imaging. The currently available T/R switch implementations based on electronic components such as diodes and field-effect transistors deviate from the ideal on/off switching behavior. The common implementations of the T/R switch in ultrasound frontends are based on using a diode bridge or cross-coupled diode pair, which are not ideal as they introduces noise and distortion in the receive path and fail to completely isolate the receiver input from the transmit pulse causing some extended dead zone in the near field. The use of a MEMS switch can significantly help as MEMS switches provide a high isolation in the open state and low insertion loss in the closed state. However, these MEMS switches are often designed for specific RF applications, in which fast switching speed is not a requirement. For ultrasound frontends switching times of a few hundreds of nanoseconds are desired.  We are proposing to develop a fast-switching (<1 µs), low control voltage (<10 V), DC-contact mode micro-electro-mechanical switch integrated and co-fabricated with a 1D capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT) array. Having the ability to integrate the micro-electro-mechanical switches on the same substrate with the transducer array will also enable implementation of the low-noise preamplifier circuitry in a standard low-voltage CMOS process. This frontend signal amplification is essential to preserve the bandwidth and signal integrity, especially when small transducer elements are loaded by a long cable. Our two specific aims in this study are:  Specific Aim 1: Develop a detailed 3D finite element model of the proposed micro-electro-mechanical switch structure and based on this model finalize the dimensions of the switch structure to achieve a switching speed of < 1 µs and a control voltage of < 10 V.  Specific Aim 2: Fabricate and test the design developed in Specific Aim 1 as a standalone testable unit as well as in combination with a 1D CMUT array using the wafer bonding based fabrication process we developed at the NCSU Nanofabrication Facility."
"9327660","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is caused by deregulation of the Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway, most commonly through loss-of-function mutations in PTCH1. My previous studies have shown that, upon deletion of Ptch1 in mice, BCCs preferentially arise from stem cells located within the hair follicle (HF) and mechanosensory touch dome (TD). In contrast, the surface epidermis, also known as the interfollicular epidermis (IFE), is protected against tumorigenesis. I hypothesize that these differences in tumor initiating potential may be due to the presence of cutaneous nerves, which innervate both the HF and TD, but not the IFE. Under normal conditions, cutaneous nerves express HH ligands. Upon surgical nerve ablation, HH activity is lost and tumor growth in the TD is reduced, highlighting a potential role for sensory nerves in promoting cancer. This proposal seeks to further characterize in detail the relationship between HH signaling, cutaneous nerves and tumorigenesis through both gain- and loss-of-function experiments. In Specific Aim 1, I will determine whether hyper-innervation is sufficient to confer BCC susceptibility to the IFE, while in Specific Aim 2, I will determine whether the mechanism by which nerves promote tumorigenesis is via inhibition of the Ptch1 homolog Ptch2. Ultimately, the studies proposed here may advance our understanding of how the tumor microenvironment, in particular sensory nerves, modulates disease progression."
"9109156","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Studies by others, our published and ongoing studies in human and MS tissue and mouse models have characterized the importance of growth arrest-specific protein 6 (Gas6) signaling and members of the Tyro3, Axl, and Mertk (TAM) family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) during inflammatory demyelinating disease and recovery (1-21,41). The maintenance of a Gas6 reservoir in multiple cell types and organs is dependent on the simultaneous expression on the cell surface of receptor tyrosine kinase Axl demonstrated to aid in the resolution of inflammation in tissue (12,18). Immunohistochemical detection of Gas6 in multiple tissues sections including spleen, small intestine, liver and lung from wild-type (WT), Mertk?/? and Tyro3?/? mice was positive. By contrast, Gas6 was lost in  these same tissues from Axl-/? mice, and Gas6 did not accumulate in serum. As Gas6 is the sole ligand for Axl, the data suggest that Axl and Gas6 are co-dependent (18). This is a unique role for a ligand/receptor interaction, and thus is integral for understanding Gas6/Axl downstream signaling. Shown in Figure 1 is a model proposed by Zagorska et al. (18) in which following proinflammatory stimuli, Axl is increased resulting in Axl-dependent phagocytosis and resolution of inflammation that results in shedding of Axl from the cell surface (soluble Axl). They further suggest that Mertk is more involved in homeostatic phagocytosis of circadian tolerogenic macrophages during the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. In vivo intravenous (IV) injection of activating anti-Axl to mice found spleen Axl kinase activity was activated 15 min later, with Axl activity back to baseline 24h later; no change in Mertk was detected. IgG had no effect activating Axl or Mertk. Similar results were observed with a Mertk activating antibody (R&D) with activated Mertk detected after 1h in vivo; however, Mertk remained at the membrane and no soluble Mertk was detected (18). Our findings (7,11,12) support and validate the proposed Model. The rationale for studying the beneficial effect of Axl and Mertk antibodies administered during myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)- induced experimental autoimmune encephalopathy (EAE) is due to their longer half-life in vivo versus the short half-life of Gas6. Even with its short half-life we observe beneficial effects of icv administration of Gas6 during cuprizone toxicity and MOG-induced (11, 41, see enclosed manuscript). Whether in vivo treatment with activating Axl antibody or Mertk antibody can be anti-inflammatory and beneficial during EAE aiding in the clearance of apoptotic debris and protective to the CNS will be a focus of this study. There is evidence for antibodies crossing the BBB in individuals with neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (22-26). Figure 1: Model for proposed differences in regulation and action of Axl and Mertk (Mer in figure) in inflammatory and homeostatic environments respectively (18). Specific Aim 1 will determine the best route of antibody administration using IP and icv injections to administer either IgG or activating anti-Axl  antibody during MOG-induced EAE and PLP-induced EAE to WT mice. We predict that WT mice (n=5/group) receiving anti-Axl antibody will have a less severe disease course with reduced proinflammatory cytokines and fewer axonal spheroids than IgG. We will demonstrate specificity using Axl-/- mice and predict the clinical course will be worse than WT mice treated with IgG and thus not be beneficial. Specific Aim 2 will determine whether prior to the onset clinical scores a single IP injection of activating or inhibiting Mertk antibody can beneficially ater the EAE clinical course relative to IgG and PBS, and maintain the reduced clinical scores and preserve axonal integrity that is lost during chronic EAE. These studies will further characterize the role of Axl and Mertk during EAE using activating antibodies as a possible therapeutic approach to target proinflammatory signaling molecules. This more refined approach will target two of the TAMs since Gas6 activates all three TAMs with a relative affinity of Gas6 for its receptors Axl>Tyro3>Mertk. We will not study Tyro3 as there is no evidence Tyro3 changes during inflammation, EAE or in MS lesions. This more focused approach may provide neuroprotection against axonal damage and loss found in chronic MS CNS tissue, and perhaps is beneficial as a therapy for individuals with progressive MS."
"9221367","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mitochondrial fission-promoting protein Drp1 is linked to neuropathology in acute and chronic neurodegenerative disorders. Mdivi-1, a blood-brain barrier permeable drug thought to inhibit Drp1, protects the brain in preclinical models of stroke, cardiac arrest, and Parkinson's disease. While major efforts are underway to test whether targeting the mitochondrial fission-fusion balance in neurons can modify neurodisease, the implications of targeting mitochondrial fission in non-neuronal brain cells are almost entirely unexplored. We see a mitochondrial structural remodeling consistent with Drp1-dependent fission in microglia when they enter a proinflammatory activation state termed M1. A bioenergetic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis promotes M1 activation, and activation is marked by production of nitric oxide (NO) and proinflammatory cytokines. Resembling the neuroinflammatory state seen in human brain injury, M1 activation can persist for months to years and result in additional pathology. A better understanding of the mechanisms contributing to M1 activation will help discover novel therapeutics that block the deleterious consequences of M1 microglial activation. We find that the Drp1 inhibitor mdivi-1 suppresses microglial NO and TNF-? production in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) ± interferon-?. We also find that mdivi-1 can inhibit reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by mitochondrial complex I in a Drp1-independent fashion. It is important to determine whether one or both of the known mdivi-1 targets, Drp1 and ROS, contribute to M1 microglial activation in vivo, and thus represent bona fide targets for therapy. This study will test the central hypothesis that in vivo, Drp1 activity but not mitochondrial ROS is required for microglial activation and the accompanying shift in cellular bioenergetics. Microglial activation will be induced in mice by intracerebroventricular administration of LPS. To investigate the role of Drp1, a novel microglia-specific inducible knockout mouse model will be developed. In addition, the existing MCAT mouse ectopically expressing matrix-targeted, H2O2-detoxifying catalase will be used to evaluate a specific requirement for mitochondrial ROS independent of other ROS. In Aim 1, we will determine whether Drp1 is necessary for the bioenergetic shift and microglial M1 activation induced by LPS in vivo. In Aim 2, we will determine whether mitochondrial ROS are required for the bioenergetic shift and microglial M1 activation induced by in vivo LPS injection. Our studies will take a crucial step toward determining whether microglial mitochondria can be targeted for therapy. Since normal Drp1-dependent fission is required for mitochondrial trafficking and quality control in neurons, a strategy specifically targeting Drp1 in microglia may ultimately be more desirable than global inhibition of mitochondrial fission. Our long-term goal is to target mitochondrial mechanisms of microglial activation in models of ischemic and traumatic brain injury, with the ultimate hope of developing a protective therapy for humans."
"9233150","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transporters catalyze entry and exit of molecules into and out of cells and organelles. They achieve cellular homeostasis, are responsible for multidrug resistance in pathogens and tumors, and when defective, cause dozens of important human genetic diseases. Our laboratory maintains, updates and improves the Transporter Classification Database, TCDB, which houses the Transporter Classification (TC) system, adopted officially by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB). TCDB is the internationally acclaimed, carefully annotated, universal standard for classifying and providing information about transporters and transport-related proteins in all major domains of life. It presents sequence, biochemical, physiological, pathological, structural and evolutionar data about these proteins and the transport systems they comprise. It uses a successful system of classification based on transporter class, subclass, family, subfamily, individual transport systems and constituent proteins.  In this competitive renewal of GM0077402, we propose to expand, update, automate and interlink TCDB. In particular, we will collaborate to integrate and unify the classification systems used by TCDB and Pfam with the formation of a TC ontological system. We will generate new data concerning transport proteins, and expand procedures for making functional predictions. This last effort will derive reliable new biological knowledge from a variety of sources, including phylogeny, motif, domain, operon and regulon analyses. Our Specific Aims are as follows: 1. To compare and evaluate methods of homology establishment, e.g., our and Pfam's statistical approaches, as well as introduce a system of protein repeat unit and domain identification. We will confirm and extend homology results based on structural superimpositions and profile: profile comparisons. We will develop and implement pipelines for the exchange of information between Pfam and TCDB and standardize both classification systems. 2. To incorporate our family descriptions into Wikipedia, to facilitate community annotation and interaction. Thus, we will add to Wikipedia, and integrate with Pfam to create a common platform for community annotation. 3. To create a substrate ontological framework for TCDB, using ChEBI and GO. 4. To use and automate multiple approaches, including phylogeny and synteny, to derive reliable functional predictions and provide guides for other researchers to do the same. 5. To utilize our TCDB advisory board for continued knowledgebase modernization and sustainability."

"9348101","Abstract The Flaviviruses, especially Dengue, Zika and Yellow Fever have been a major public health concern for centuries in semi and tropical climates, including parts of the southern US. Presently, these viruses are the cause of more than 300 million infections per year. Global travel, alteration of the underlying mosquito vector?s geographical range, the possibility of RNA genome mutation resulting from vector changes and new environmental selective pressures all appear to have influenced the spread of Flavivirus infection to new human populations. More recently, Zika, with the proposed link to microcephaly and other neurological birth defects, has thrust into the spotlight an urgent need for an economical, international-scale screening of susceptible populations. We believe there is a critical need to develop new technology to collect, transport and recover blood or blood products containing this pervasive class of unstable enveloped RNA virus, in the complete absence of any sort of protection via refrigeration. The goal of this new technology is the recovery of intact viral genomes to support viral load and nucleic acid testing: to improve the diagnoses of Flavivirus infection and, coupled with new, now- inexpensive methods of Next Gen sequencing, to provide the real possibility of discovering how the viral genome may be mutating under selective pressure. The overarching requirement for such new sample collection and preservation technology is that it must be robust enough to preserve even the most unstable of the Flavivirus RNAs, yet inexpensive enough to support both population scale public health screening and sophisticated molecular epidemiology to detect mutational drift (via Next-Gen sequencing) while being deployable in a way that facilitates implementation in isolated, tropical, poor, susceptible populations in the complete absence of cryogenic preservation. GenTegra, in collaboration with Ahlstrom (the world-leader in medical grade filter paper for newborn screening) have recently co-developed a medical grade cellulose paper that supports long term stabilization of the DNA in blood at ambient temperature. In this Phase II SBIR, GenTegra will leverage that ongoing collaboration with Ahlstrom, coupled with our expertise in the development and implementation of the new stabilization chemistries, to develop a completely new filter paper based product for Flavivirus RNA field collection and preservation. To achieve those highly Innovative and Significant goals, we propose 3 Specific Aims, to be executed over 2 years. Upon successful completion, this program will yield a product prototype that will be ready for manufacturing scale-up and international commercial deployment. The Investigators and Research Environment among the collaborating institutions (GenTegra, ATCC, and Ahlstrom) are of international caliber with respect to delivering this (21st century) approach to paper-based biosample collection. It should be noted that, although this SBIR is purely focused on Flavivirus, the technology may be generally applicable to ambient temperature collection and transport of all RNA viruses in animals and man."
"9233438","Project Summary Malignant transformation of cells drives the development of tumors. Cancer cells can be routinely genotyped today revealing a large number of somatic mutations. However, it remains unclear which mutations contribute to malignant transformation and provide a survival advantage to cancer cells and which are simply passenger mutations. Rather than dissecting each mutation individually by biochemical techniques such as cloning and overexpression, we propose to systematically profile the proteome of cancer cells for altered protein surface accessibility, which can help to better understand the impact of somatic mutations on proteome function and activity. Neomorphic perturbations in protein surface accessibility is revealed with a new, quantitative, in vivo chemical labeling approach coupled to shot gun proteomics. The novel approach can be used as a platform technology to screen patient-derived cancer cells and holds promise to pinpoint critical, cancer cell specific perturbations in the proteome."

"9236201","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of the proposed research is to develop enhanced anomalous diffraction methods for analyzing structures of biological macromolecules. We build on our recent accomplishments at New York Structural Biology Center (NYSBC) beamlines at Brookhaven's National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) and worldwide experience showing that multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) and SAD, MAD's single-wavelength counterpart, now predominate for de novo determinations of three- dimensional structures for biological macromolecules. We propose to optimize SAD and MAD phasing procedures by meeting the demands of compelling applications to current problems of biological significance. Biologically exciting problems motivate the development of appropriate tools, and forefront methods accelerate the solution of structures for systems of biological and medical significance. The overall objective is embodied in four specific aims: (1) we propose to enhance SAD phasing procedures for challenging problems such as selenomethionyl proteins at low resolution and only-light-atom native structures. A focus is on improved methods for increasing signal-to-noise ratios for anomalous diffraction by combining data from many crystals. (2) We propose to enhance MAD procedures for accurate experimental phase evaluation. Data collection strategies will be devised to mitigate radiation damage and minimize systematic errors. (3) We propose to develop procedures for low-energy anomalous diffraction experiments. We will develop experimental procedures and design instrumentation for low-energy (3 - 7 keV) experiments aiming to enhance anomalous signal from light atoms such as sulfur and phosphorous. (4) We propose to develop automation and enhanced procedures to facilitate SAD and MAD analyses from many crystals. A first priority is to encode and disseminate our current multi-crystal SAD process in convenient software."
"9282470","Project Summary Restricted, repetitive behavior refers to multiple behavioral categories that include stereotyped movements, compulsions, and rituals. Repetitive behavior is diagnostic for autism spectrum disorders (ASD), highly prevalent in syndromic and non-syndromic intellectual and developmental disability (IDD), and common in certain neurological disorders (e.g. Tourette syndrome, fronto-temporal dementia). Despite its clinical importance, effective interventions for repetitive behavior are lacking owing, at least in part, to only a rudimentary understanding of the relevant neural circuitry mediating such behavior. Identifying discrete neural pathways controlling repetitive behaviors is key to determining neurobiological mechanisms and developing effective treatments. Our prior work, using two mouse models of repetitive behavior, has identified cortico- basal ganglia circuitry dysregulation, specifically decreased neuronal activation in brain areas associated with the indirect basal ganglia pathway. What is lacking, however, is direct evidence of discrete basal ganglia projections that control the expression of repetitive behavior. Thus, the overall goal of this project is to determine specific cortical basal ganglia pathways that control repetitive behavior. We will test two hypotheses: activation of the indirect basal ganglia pathway via disinhibition of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) will significantly and rapidly reduce repetitive behavior and inhibition of the hyperdirect pathway will exacerbate repetitive behavior. To test these hypotheses, we will employ in vivo optogenetics to manipulate, with the requisite temporal and spatial resolution, the critical functional circuitry hypothesized to mediate the expression of repetitive behavior. Using this approach, we propose to test directly the importance of the indirect and the hyperdirect basal ganglia pathways in mediating repetitive behavior. This will be done using an inbred mouse strain (C58) that exhibits a well-characterized, robust repetitive behavior phenotype. Dissecting the basal ganglia circuitry controlling the expression of repetitive behavior will be innovative and impactful and guide the development of novel treatments in disorders involving aberrant repetitive behavior."
"9386357","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Historically, bacteria were either seen as pathogenic if they caused disease or benign if they lived commensally with the host. In many cases, however, single organisms have not been identified that are consistently associated with disease, but rather it is thought that bacterial community structure and bacteria- bacteria interactions differ between healthy and diseased individuals, otherwise known as dysbiosis. Naturally, investigating the microbiomes of healthy and diseased individuals using systems biology methodology could lead to insight into the processes that underlie dysbiosis. To that end, methodology has been developed to identify co-occurrence networks from microbiome data. However, to date this methodology has primarily been applied to healthy microbiome datasets and we still lack an understanding of the common properties of dysbiosis. To address these gaps, I propose to build gut microbiome co-occurrence networks for 34 immune diseases and 133 quantitative phenotypes using ~2,500 individuals from the United Kingdom Adult Twins Registry (TwinsUK), for which microbiome and phenotype data has previously been collected. First, I will identify disease-associated bacteria using generalized and linear mixed models that take into account relatedness between individuals. Next, I will use a simulation framework to compare six microbiome co- occurrence network software packages to quantify the consistency of co-occurrence networks for individuals either i) with and without disease or ii) from opposite tails of quantitative phenotype distributions. Using these networks, I will identify modules of co-occurring bacteria that are differentially abundant in disease, examine general network statistics (such as modularity and diversity), and examine the properties of disease-associated nodes as determined in Aim 1 (such as degree, betweenness, and closeness centrality). Additionally, I will take advantage of the twin relationships in our data to identify heritable network characteristics and examine co- heritability of pairs of bacteria. Finally, this will be the first study to compare  these network statistics across a range of diseases in order to develop a model of how microbiome network structure differs in health and disease. Additionally, I will compare underlying network structure across phenotypes to identify diseases that share similar gut microbiome alterations. Understanding the gut microbiome at this level will be beneficial for designing therapies to target the microbiota and ultimately improve human health."
"9243195","Age-associated changes in immune function in old age are a known risk factor for tuberculosis (TB) however, the contribution of the heightened systemic inflammatory state (inflammaging) often observed in elderly individuals has not been previously considered. In Aim 1 we hypothesize that inflammation in the periphery will serve as a predictive biomarker of pulmonary inflammation and susceptibility to M.tb infection in old age. We will test this hypothesis by studying the function of circulating monocytes and soluble mediators from adult and elderly donors and compare those signatures to data obtained in Projects 1 and 2 where M.tb interactions with alveolar macrophages and alveolar lining fluid are studied in the same subjects. Our goal is to identify predictive cellular and/or molecular patterns in the periphery in old age that will correlate with an increased susceptibility to M.tb infection in the lung in old age. These comparative analyses of peripheral and pulmonary immune responses extend our studies from observational to mechanistic and allow us to identify peripheral predictive biomarkers of M.tb susceptibility that may have clinical application. We also hypothesize that M.tb infection further fuels the systemic inflammaging state in old age and predisposes elderly individuals to develop symptoms of TB that are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. We will test this by investigating the inflammatory phenotype and function of peripheral blood monocytes and inflammatory and immuno- regulatory cytokines from adult and elderly subjects with latent or active TB. While inflammaging has been established as a critical factor of health-span in the elderly, adaptive immune function is essential for the control of many infectious diseases, including TB. It is unknown whether T cells can maintain their effector function throughout a long-term latent M.tb infection. We hypothesize that individuals with latent M.tb infection accumulate exhausted antigen specific T cells that no longer respond optimally to M.tb infection. We will determine the phenotype and function of M.tb specific T cells in adult and elderly subjects with latent M.tb infection and active TB, which will synergize with studies of M.tb infected mice performed in Project 3. The ability to generate a robust recall response will be determined in vitro in response to M.tb antigens and in vivo using an antigen challenge model where infiltrating lymphocytes are isolated from human TST induration biopsies. This will be the first study to determine M.tb specific adaptive immune function in elderly individuals with latent M.tb infection. Given the paucity of information regarding immune function in elderly TB patients as well as elderly with latent M.tb infection, this project is highly significant. Project 4 provides an opportunity to perform translational science within the continuum of this Program Project, and combines the proven collaborative expertise of a clinical scientist (Wang) and basic researcher (Turner)."
"9232699","Biomarkers for cancer play key roles in both the clinic and the lab, providing diagnostic and prognostic tools to enable effective medical interventions, as well as improving our basic understanding of diseases. Clinical applications include early disease detection, prediction of risk, determination of treatment options, and monitoring disease progression and treatment efficacy. However, reaching the point of clinical utility requires overcoming two large hurdles 1) discovering and validating biomarkers, and 2) developing clinical tests to monitor the biomarkers. Limitations of current biomarker detection assays ? including lack of sensitivity, specificity, and clinical compatibility ? are critical obstacles in realizing the promise of cancer biomarkers. We will develop a new approach that will overcome these challenges by leveraging recent developments in DNA nanotechnology and multiplexed single-molecule analysis to create an ultrasensitive detection platform that is low cost, accessible, and capable of detecting a wide variety of both protein and RNA biomarkers in biological fluids. Our approach pairs rationally designed DNA nanoswitches with an accessible new single- molecule instrument to enable high-sensitivity, multiplexed biomarker detection in a benchtop centrifuge. Our recently invented DNA nanoswitches are designed to undergo a conformational change upon binding a specific molecular biomarker, and can be easily ?reprogrammed? for a variety of biomarkers. The induced conformational changes are detected at the single-molecule level using a newly developed Centrifuge Force Microscope (CFM), which is capable of monitoring thousands of such changes simultaneously within a standard benchtop centrifuge. To demonstrate our approach, we will use pancreatic cancer as a model system, where recent evidence has shown advantages in using both protein and microRNA biomarkers for disease diagnosis. Specifically, we will: 1) Demonstrate proof of concept detection and quantification of pancreatic cancer biomarkers CA19-9 and miR-196a, 2) Optimize the biosensing platform for use with complex biological fluids, such as serum and urine, and 3) Multiplex our system to enable the simultaneous detection of multiple RNA and protein biomarkers for pancreatic cancer. Our proposed approach offers a number of important advantages including: i) unambiguous ?digital? on and off signals, ii) single-molecule sensitivity, iii) programmability of detection elements for different biomarkers, iv) simultaneous detection of multiple biomarkers in the same sample, and iv) high accessibility owing to the use of standard laboratory equipment. This biosensing platform has the potential to be a transformative technology in biomedical research and medicine. Single-molecule detection provides the ultimate sensitivity, and our new CFM design enables such sensitivity using already standard lab equipment. By providing detection sensitivity that meets or exceeds state-of-the-art clinical analyzers, we anticipate that our approach could help facilitate new initiatives in precision medicine, such as companion diagnostics for individualized cancer treatments."
"9328546","ABSTRACT Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy: Taking a Place in Mainstream Oncology, organized by Drs. Robert D. Schreiber, James P. Allison, Philip D. Greenberg and Glenn Dranoff. The conference will be held in Whistler, British Columbia, Canada from March 19-23, 2017. The fields of cancer immunology and immunotherapy continue to make great strides in providing both a comprehensive understanding of the basic mechanisms underlying tumor-immune system interactions and applying this knowledge to the development of effective immune-based cancer therapies. As such, this conference is organized to highlight recent insights into the complex roles of immune components and pathways in controlling or alternatively promoting cancer and to showcase recent uses of cancer vaccines, checkpoint blocking strategies, adoptive cell therapies and cellular engineering approaches, either as mono- or combinatorial therapies, that have resulted in durable, effective and safe therapeutic responses to an increasing number of cancer patients. Part of the conference will also focus on new, developing technologies that are likely to expand our capacity to monitor the effects of cancer immunotherapy with a precision, refinement and at a level that has not been possible in the past. Both established and up-and-coming investigators will have ample opportunities to interact informally and share views with junior investigators and trainees in a collegial and relaxed atmosphere."
"9311396","Project Summary/Abstract This application joins the efforts of two co-principal investigators, one a new and early stage investigator, an orthopaedic surgeon-scientist who recently completed a National Cancer Institute sponsored K08 career development award focused on mouse modeling of sarcomagenesis, the other an experienced biochemist with expertise in chromatin remodeling complexes and genomics. These investigators have assembled a team to bring their varied experience to bear on the core epigenetic mechanisms of synovial sarcomagenesis. Synovial sarcoma is the most common soft-tissue sarcoma of adolescence and young adulthood. It is driven by a single genetic aberration: the creation of a fusion oncogene from a balanced chromosomal translocation t(X;18). In models developed by the investigators and their colleagues, expression of these SS18-SSX fusion oncogenes in the mouse drives faithful recapitulations of human synovial sarcoma. The SS18-SSX fusion oncoproteins have been shown in human synovial sarcoma cell lines to utilize two epigenetic mechanisms to impact the transcription of target genes. In one mechanism, SS18-SSX forms a bridge that relocates TLE1- aggregated repressors to ATF2-bound loci. The second mechanism involves the modulation of the chromatin remodeling BAF complex by replacing native SS18 with the fusion and ejecting another member, SNF5. Each mechanism has been demonstrated at specific loci in cell lines, but not genome-wide or in tumors. Working from the hypothesis that SS18-SSX expression misregulates the recruitment and/or activity of chromatin remodeling and modifying complexes to create an oncogenic transcriptional profile, the proposed experiments will specifically (1) Determine the necessity of the two described mechanisms to synovial sarcomagenesis, (2) Determine whether SS18-SSX alters BAF function, location, or both, beyond SNF5 ejection, and (3) Determine the drivers of SS18-SSX oncogenesis by defining the genomic locations of the SS18-SSX fusion oncoprotein (and partners) by ChIP-seq, and their impact at occupied loci by RNA-seq. Reverse genetic experiments in an otherwise fully penetrant model of synovial sarcomagenesis in the mouse will test the necessity of central members of each mechanism. Both conditional and temporally inducible expression of SS18-SSX will test the impact of its addition to Snf5-loss induced tumorigenesis in the mouse. Synovial sarcoma will specifically be induced in mice by expression of a novel V5-tagged SS18-SSX fusion, to correct for the difficult interpretation of prior experiments with antibodies non-specific for the fusion, thus enabling genome-wide localization of the fusion and co-localization of partnering proteins at silenced and activated loci. These genomic localization assessments will therefore be performed in an idealized experimental tumorigenesis setting with comparison control assessments available in the tissue most enriched for the pre-transformation cell of origin. Data from this idealized experimental paradigm in the model will then be prioritized and validated with comparative genomics from human synovial sarcoma samples."

"9243193","This project will determine the effect of aging on alveolar macrophages (AMs) and their interaction with M.tb. We will address how alterations in AM biology during aging impact the increased risk of the elderly to airborne infection, a greatly underexplored area. AMs are classified as alternatively activated macrophages or, more generally, immunoregulatory macrophages that enable clearance of aerosolized particulates while maintaining optimal gas exchange. The studies herein are based on the emerging concept that with aging chronic low- grade inflammation (inflammaging) occurs in the lung which alters AM phenotype and function. Our central hypothesis is that chronic lung inflammation during aging is associated with a unique inflammatory signature which paradoxically leads to early control of M.tb in AMs, while setting the stage for subsequent enhanced growth and bacterial dissemination. We put forth the novel hypothesis that this occurs through uncontrolled activation of a specific macrophage immunoregulatory network resulting in enhanced cellular immigration to the lungs, AM activation and pathology. The consequences of the different inflammatory sequences in the young vs. old is that in the young, the immunoregulatory signature results in establishment of latency with stable granulomas containing fewer M.tb and immune cells. In contrast, in the elderly the long-term effects of the chronic inflammation are establishment of latency with unstable granulomas containing more M.tb and activated immune cells that drive reactivation. We have developed a new three stage model to be explored in 3 specific aims: 1) Define age-related phenotype and immune function of AMs (Stage 1). Expression of specific receptors, inflammatory modulators and oxidants will be compared in adult/elderly human and young/old mouse AMs. We will define the initial signaling pathways that regulate cytokine production and determine if old age increases recruitment and retention of activated AMs in the lung. 2) Determine AM uptake and control of M.tb in old age while initiating an aberrant inflammatory signaling network (Stages 2 and 3). We will compare phagocytosis, oxidative responses, trafficking and intracellular growth of M.tb in AMs in old vs. young age. We will also characterize an alternative NF-??1-mediated signaling pathway in AMs from the elderly which, during M.tb infection, leads to increased IL-10, and activation of an IFN-?/? autocrine feedback loop that sustains IL- 10 and CCL2 production. 3) Define the impact of the AM aberrant inflammatory signaling network during the course of infection in old mice, including reactivation (Stage 3). We will determine activity of the aberrant signaling network during the course of in vivo infection of old mice. We will also assess the importance of specific signaling network components on enhanced M.tb growth in old mice using blockers. The project fully integrates with and informs the other projects and cores. The proposed studies are innovative in that they provide the first comprehensive, model-driven, comparative and mechanistic analyses of the effects of aging on human and mouse AM function in old age."
"9221321","The NIDDK framework for translational research is expansive, ranging from bench to bedside all the way up  to community-based interventions. But this extensive framework leaves some important gaps: (1) It  sometimes disconnects laboratory from population research, impeding discovery of novel risk factors for  diabetes and novel complications of diabetes or diabetes treatment; (2) It sometimes assumes that large  trials have made treatment and prevention of diabetes matters of 'settled science', when in fact there are  lingering controversies; (3) It generally ignores patient safety as a subject of investigation, despite persistent  concerns about safety across a wide range of diabetes drugs and diabetes treatment strategies. (4) It  sometimes ignores the underiying clinical complexity of patients with diabetes, especially those who are  older or who have coexisting heart disease or cancer.  At the Hopkins-UMD DRC, we have a track record of supporting research that fills these gaps, often with  high-impact publications.

"9225243","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a study of residential patterns in urban America in 1940, taking advantage of newly available census data to pursue spatial questions at a level of detail and with methodologies that were not previously possible. It will organize the complete microdata file of 132 million Americans from the 1940 census into summary files at the level of the Enumeration District (ED), making it possible to study in detail the composition of small neighborhood areas across the country. These files will be made available at various geographic levels for the use of other researchers. For 69 major cities the EDs and census blocks will be mapped and households geocoded to ED segments of 1-3 blocks along a single street. For 6 metropolitan regions the individual records will be geocoded for both cities and suburbs, allowing more detailed analysis of residential patterns. These data will be used to study segregation patterns and processes that divided residents by race, ethnicity, and social class. 1) It will analyze variations across cities in the spatial assimilation of blacks (well intothe Great Migration from South to North) and immigrant groups in the first and second generation, plus segregation between families at different levels of SES. 2) It will examine the predictors of locational attainment to assess how race, ethnicity, class, and other characteristics affect the kinds of neighborhoods people live in, introducing characteristics of cities as contextual predictors of residential outcomes. 3) The geocoded address information will be exploited to study how individual residents are aggregated into neighborhoods in more detail, experimenting with a range of new methods to identify neighborhoods inductively based on their race/ethnicity and social class composition. 4) Geocoded data will also be used to draw overlapping, egocentric neighborhood areas around households at various spatial scales to define segregation patterns more flexibly. Discrete choice models will be applied to test hypotheses about the relative importance of race/ethnicity, class, and other attributes in constituting socialy distinct neighborhoods. These interrelated analyses will provide an important new point of reference for research on the incorporation of minority groups and immigrants in U.S. society today, as well as for the boundaries created by class segregation. The new spatial database will make a permanent and substantial addition to the nation's statistical infrastructure for health and population research, education, and policy making. It will allow study of neighborhood conditions for immigrants, minorities, and the urban poor at a critical historical moment and enable new kinds of spatial analysis. Linked to later demographic records and surveys it will allow study of neighborhood effects on life outcomes such as health, marriage and fertility, and longevity for the pre-baby boom generation of persons born before 1940."
"9238502","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cisplatin is one of the most widely used and most potent cancer therapy drugs. However, the use of cisplatin is associated with a major side-effect of nephrotoxicity, resulting in acute kidney injury (cisplatin-AKI) in over 25% of patients. The mechanism of cisplatin-AKI remains unclear and effective renoprotective approaches are not available. We have recently unveiled a critical role of PKC? in cisplatin-AKI and, remarkably, inhibition of PKC? not only protects kidneys but can also enhance the chemotherapy effect of cisplatin in tumors. Despite these findings, it is largely unclear how PKC? inhibition can protect kidneys, while killing cancer cells. We have demonstrated autophagy induction in cisplatin-AKI and its critical role of kidney protection. Moreover, mitophagy that removes damaged mitochondria via autophagy has been suggested. Mechanistically, our preliminary work supports the involvement of p53 and PKC? in autophagy regulation during cisplatin-AKI. We hypothesize that: 1) mitophagy is activated during cisplatin-AKI and accounts largely for the renoprotective effect of autophagy; 2) p53 contributes to autophagy induction in cisplatin-AKI, whereas PKC? plays an autophagy suppressive role; and 3) inhibition of PKC? may protect kidneys during cisplatin chemotherapy by enhancing autophagy. To test this hypothesis, we propose to: 1) elucidate mitophagy as a protective mechanism of autophagy in cisplatin-AKI; 2) determine the autophagy-promoting role of p53 in cisplatin-AKI; 3) delineate the autophagy-suppressing role of PKC? in cisplatin-AKI; and 4) test the hypothesis that PKC? inhibition protects kidneys through enhancing autophagy by analyzing the effects of PKC? inhibition in autophagy-suppressed and non-suppressed mice. Completion of the research will not only gain significant insights into autophagy protection and regulation in renal pathogenesis, but will also elucidate autophagy as a mechanism of the renoprotective effect of PKC? inhibition, suggesting a novel therapeutic strategy for kidney protection during chemotherapy in cancer patients."
"9229080","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Palmitoylation is the covalent attachment of C16 fatty acids to proteins. Palmitoylation is a dynamic post- translational modification and unlike other stable lipid modifications (isoprenylation, farnesylation). One of the major enzymes that remove this lipid modification is palmitoyl protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1). Recessive loss-of-function mutations in PPT1 cause Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (NCL), a progressive neurodegenerative disease with lysosomal pathology. Complete loss of PPT1 enzymatic activity leads to an infantile form of the disease, while residual activity (5-10%) leads to adult-onset NCL. Patients accumulate lipidated peptides suggesting that deficient depalmitoylation leads to compromised protein degradation. These clinical findings strongly suggest that PPT1 activity is critical for neuronal function and health. Despite its importance, the substrates of PPT1 remain to be defined. In this proposal, we aim to identify PPT1 substrates based on an unbiased proteomic screen comparing the palmitomes of wildtype and PPT1 knockout brains. Then, we will examine which of these substrates are depalmitoylated in response to neuronal activity. These experiments will delineate an important, yet understudied, aspect of neuronal cell biology and elucidate the mechanisms of NCL. Achieving these goals is important for human health, given the direct links between PPT1 and NCL as well as the wide range of neurodegenerative disorders that involve protein palmitoylation."

"9231363","Ebola virus (EBOV; also known as Zaire ebolavirus) (family Filoviridae) is among the most lethal infectious agents known, producing sporadic outbreaks of severe, and highly lethal hemorrhagic fever in humans and nonhuman primates (NHPs). Owing to high morbidity and mortality rates in natural outbreaks, lack of prophylactic and treatment options, aerosol transmission potential, and their highly virulent nature, Ebola viruses have been identified as both NIAID Category A Priority pathogens and CDC Category A Agents of Bioterrorism. Despite this, the current standard of care is limited to palliative treatment and no therapeutic interventions have been approved against EBOV infection. Among many prophylactic and therapeutic platforms currently under development, monoclonal antibody (mAb) technology has emerged as one of the most promising treatment methods. Worldwide, there exist ~100 mAbs against EBOV that have been characterized to varying degrees. Six of these mAbs have demonstrated complete to partial protection of NHPs when administered from 1 to 4- 5 days after lethal infection. The goal of Project 1 is to achieve total protection in NHPs as late as possible in the course of infection with an ideal cocktail. To this end, the -100 mAbs identified will be produced in a plant expression system and tested in vitro and in vivo for efficacy against EBOV infection. All mAbs will be tested for efficacy in mice and the top performs will subsequently be tested in guinea pigs, individually and in combination. The best mAb combinations will be further tested in NHPs. This downselection process will take into consideration efficacy, binding site, function and complementarity of each mAb. Overall, this proposal is to lay down the scientific foundation for evidence-based selection of the most effective mAb countermeasure against EBOV infection. This will provide an immediate option for compassionate use in post-exposure situations, a research benchmark for evaluation and comparison of additional mAb therapies that might be developed in the future, and essential components of the treatment that will precede complete pharmacokinetics and toxicology studies prior to FDA licensure."
"9308742","Abstract The placenta, critical for fetal health and development and a potential marker of maternal health, is poorly understood. Traditionally, studies of human placental function have focused on samples obtained at term, limiting our ability to understand both normal placental development and function throughout human gestation. The development of conditions and diseases which manifest throughout pregnancy attributed to placental development and subsequently function most likely occur early in gestation. Early direct placental assessment can be achieved through chorionic villus sampling (CVS), performed in the late first trimester. These villi, used for cytogenetic testing, also represent a unique window into the developing placenta. We developed techniques to bank unused villi for use in subsequent multiple ?omics testing including genomics, epigenomics and transcriptomics and also collect term placental samples from these pregnancies providing a window into placental development and potential function throughout gestation. Recently, we identified sex differences in a number of genes expressed on autosomes and sex chromosomes in the first trimester placenta, unique from those identified at term, suggesting there are sex differences in placental development as early as the first trimester. In addition, we also identified differences in noncoding RNA fractions among the sexes, expressed from both autosomes and sex chromosomes. As these noncoding RNA?s are important regulators of transcriptional activity and hence overall function, they may explain the more subtle sex differences observed in fetal development and disease as a result of placental development. However, sexual dimorphism of gene regulation through noncoding RNA has not been studied in normal placental development. Thus, using our already stored samples and our genomics bioinformatics expertise, we have the opportunity to better understand the role of these noncoding RNAs on RNA regulation in placental development throughout gestation among the sexes. In addition, we have corresponding banked maternal plasma from pregnancies in which villi are banked. We have recently isolated placental RNA from our stored samples and intend to use these samples to identify key markers of placental function that are reflective of the intrauterine placenta. Thus, we intend to use our established banked first trimester and term placental samples to establish a normative and sexually distinct placental signature of total RNA (noncoding and coding) throughout gestation. We also intend to identify functional activity of noncoding RNAs on placental function followed by the development of a functionally relevant signature that can be identified in the maternal circulation."

Such a multivalent vaccine would also provide protection against emerging pathogens that have acquired new virulence factors such as the Shiga toxin-expressing EAEC German outbreak strain. These enteropathogens are all Category B risk agents of biodefense concern. A vaccine with broad coverage against this group would be beneficial to multiple segments of the US population, including: 1) adult and child travelers who visit less developed countries where these infections are hyperendemic; 2) children in certain high risk areas of the US; 3) and for mass immunization in the face a natural or deliberate outbreak scenario. Immunization by the mucosal route is an effective method for induction of mucosal and systemic immune responses, believed to be important in protection against these enteropathogens. Our successful completion of 5 attenuated Shigella live vector strains during the Mid- Atlantic RCE (MARCE) funding period, provides the platform for the expression of protective antigens from each enteropathogen. Chromosomal insertion technology and autotransporter-based surface expression of heterologous antigens will ensure stability of vaccine constructs and optimal presentation to the host. In order to confirm the safety, immunogenicity and protective capacity of the multivalent vaccine, we have recruited expert collaborators who have developed innovative, relevant animal models for each component enteropathogen. These studies will constitute preclinical evaluations necessary for advancement to clinical trials. The multivalent vaccine will be tested in the neonatal mouse model in order to assess its utility in the very young thus expanding the potential target population age range. At the completion of these studies, we expect to have completed the construction and testing of a multivalent vaccine consisting of a mixture of live attenuated Shigella strains expressing critical antigens from ETEC, STEC and EAEC that will be broadly protective against enteric infections with these pathogens. The genetic related of these pathogens makes them well suited for grouping in this vaccine strategy that represents an important part of the overall program to develop an Immunoprophylactic Strategy to Control Emerging Enteric Infections."
"9355796","ABSTRACT  The fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans is responsible for more than half a million deaths worldwide each year largely because of the AIDS pandemic. Epidemiological evidence indicates a high prevalence of non-symptomatic cryptococcal infections in the general population. Fatal systemic diseases often occur through re-activation of latent infections in patients when their immunity is impaired by HIV infection or immunosuppressive therapies. Although Cryptococcus typically grows in a haploid state, large polyploid Cryptococcus cells (mostly 4C and occasionally 8C) are observed in infected lungs and are proposed to promote cryptococcal latency and persistence. These polyploid cells can subsequently give rise to small haploid cryptococcal populations. It is unclear how ploidy reduction occurs in Cryptococcus during infection and whether this process contributes to Cryptococcus reactivation.  Our preliminary data indicate that a subpopulation of Cryptococcus cells become large in serum with meiosis mutants showing increased proportion of cells with elevated cell size. Interestingly, we found that large polyploid cryptococcal cells induced by genotoxic stress showed meiosis-like features during de- polyploidization process in vitro. Consistently, blocking meiosis impedes ploidy reduction in vitro. The meiosis mutants also showed reduced fungal burden in the lungs compared to the wild type when polyploid cells were used to inoculate mice. Most excitingly, we found that the meiosis-specific recombinase gene DMC1 is activated in Cryptococcus during infection in the murine model of cryptococcosis. These preliminary data led us to hypothesize that Cryptococcus can respond to the hostile host environment by polyploidization and this fungus can return to normal ploidy through meiosis in a permissive host condition due to HIV infection, generating proliferative haploid progeny and causing fatal systemic infections. Thus the life-cycle associated progression of cryptococcosis might be similar to the gametogenesis process of cancer. In that process, various cancer cells become polyploid in response to genotoxic chemotherapy or radiation therapy. These polyploid tumor cells can de-polyploidize through a meiosis-like process, giving rise to rejuvenated and proliferative cancer cells with normal ploidy. In this exploratory R21 proposal, our objectives are to determine the occurrence of meiosis in Cryptococcus during infection (Aim 1), and to dissect the process of ploidy reduction in this pathogen and to assess the contribution of meiosis to cryptococcal pathogenesis (Aim 2). The proposed work is a stepping stone for further comprehensive investigation into the important and yet poorly understood aspects of cryptococcal disease progression (latency and reactivation).  "

"9392440","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD) are an understudied, undertreated sub-group of smokers. Of the 42 million smokers in the United States, an estimated 14.3 million (34%) meet lifetime criteria for SAD. Compared to the general population, individuals with SAD have double the prevalence rates of cigarette smoking (33% vs. 17%), have significantly more unsuccessful quit attempts (64% vs. 49%), and are less likely to remain abstinent after treatment (29% vs. 36%). Despite the evidence that SAD is a significant risk factor for continued smoking and smoking relapse, no known interventions are specifically designed to address the unique needs of this group of smokers. Specifically, the key barriers to successful cessation among this group are: (1) smoking cigarettes to avoid and/or cope with symptoms of social anxiety, and (2) significantly greater levels of craving during times of abstinence. A new, targeted treatment addressing the needs of this significant group of smokers is needed. Web-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a new model for delivering smoking cessation treatment that yielded twice the cessation rates as the US government's Smokefree.gov site at 3-month follow-up (23% vs. 10%). Tailoring this intervention to address the unmet needs for smokers with SAD could significantly increase the quit rates of the substantial proportion of smokers with SAD. The proposed treatment development project will tailor an existing web-based ACT intervention for a general population of smokers (WebQuit) into one specifically designed for smokers with SAD (WebQuit-SAD). Development of WebQuit-SAD will be informed by: (1) user receptivity and intervention process data among smokers with SAD who completed the original WebQuit intervention (study in progress; estimated SAD subsample N = 720), (2) focus groups consisting of smokers with SAD, and (3) iterative usability testing. The final product of this project will be an intervention  that is technology-enhanced and community-friendly, guided by theory-based mechanisms of change, and with a focus on co-occurring mental health conditions. Thus, it has great potential for broad dissemination and ability to reach and treat the 14.3 million smokers with social anxiety disorder."
"9188013","The Central Dogma of Biology - whereby genetic information gets replicated, transcribed, and translated into proteins-is carried out by a handful of critical enzymes that include polymerases, helicases, and ribosomes. Together, these enzymes constitute a core group of sophisticated, biomolecular machines Understanding their function holds a key to understanding life, and by extension, to the treatment of human disease. Hard-won knowledge about biomolecules is informing work at the forefront of nanoscience,: which hopes to harness tiny devices to better the human condition.  Put simply, we need to know how Nature's machines work if we're ever to fix them or to emulate them. A property shared by many nucleic acid-based enzymes is that they function as molecular motors: once bound to DNA or RNA, they undergo repeated cycles, often traveling considerable distances. This motion is accompanied by force production and requires chemical energy.  In contrast tomechanoenzymes like myosin, the properties of nucleic acid-based motors axe modulated by an ever-changing template underfoot, yielding rich behavior. Although structural data are available for many such enzymes, comparatively little is known about their molecular mechanisms Recently, biophysical studies have been revolutionized by the ability to measure forces and displacements at the level of single molecules, using techniques that include optical traps, nanometry, and fluorescence Single-molecule approaches supply critical information that has been hitherto inaccessible by traditional techniques. Previously, my group succeeded in developing optical trapping instrumentation that?s able to register displacements down to the atomic level (~1 A). Consequently, we can record from bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) molecules as these step from base to base along DNA. Improved instrumental stability now allows us to reconstruct energy landscapes for folding transitions in nucleic acids that form complex structures (riboswitches, ribozymes, etc.). We propose to continue our single-molecule work on transcription by RNAP. We also plan to use single-molecule assays to address unsolved problems of co-transcriptional folding and gene regulation, and to better understand the sequence elements that regulate transcriptional elongation and termination {e.g., riboswitches). A closely related assay will allow us to study the initiation of translation by ribosomes in eukaryotes, along with the RNA sequence elements that modulate that process. Finally, we will pursue a successful single-molecule assay we developed for transcription by Pol II (RNAPII), the eukaryotic analog of RNAP."

"9242058","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States, but African Americans bear a disproportionate burden from CVD. The reasons why African Americans are unusually susceptible to CVD and its complications are complex, multifactorial, and incompletely understood. Standard risk factors and subclinical atherosclerotic disease severity do not fully define the risk for CVD. Researchers have come to understand that vascular dysfunction contributes at both early and advanced stages in the pathogenesis of coronary heart disease and stroke. We propose to noninvasively characterize vascular function in 3,829 African Americans participants in the Jackson Heart Study by examining three related vascular phenotypes. We will measure (1) flow-mediated brachial artery dilation (FMD) and reactive hyperemia, (2) digital peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) waveforms, and (3) aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) and pressure flow relations. Our study includes four specific aims. We will: (1) Examine cross-sectional relations between CVD risk factors and FMD, PAT and PWV in African American adults; (2) Study the contribution of genetic variation to FMD, PAT and PWV in conduit vessels in African Americans; (3) Relate FMD, PAT and PWV to each other and to regional adiposity and to other markers of subclinical CVD; and (4) Assess the relation of FMD, PAT and PWV in conduit arteries to incident CVD events and mortality. The study will provide a novel opportunity to characterize the environmental and genetic correlates and the prognostic implications of abnormal vascular function in African Americans. By focusing on an African American cohort, the project will lead to innovative insights into health and disease in a population that is disproportionately at risk of CVD morbidity and mortality in the U.S."
"9217654","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reducing proteinuria slows the progression of chronic kidney disease. The current standard of care is to block of the renin - angiotensin system at various levels to reduce proteinuria. However, reduction of proteinuria is often incomplete, since other pathways involved in the pathogenesis or modification of proteinuria are not affected by this therapy. The long term goal of the PI's lab is to develop novel mechanism - based therapeutic agents that will reduce proteinuria and reduce the progression of chronic kidney disease due to glomerular disorders. Reducing the progression of chronic kidney disease to end stage kidney disease will have a major positive social and financial impact in the United States and worldwide. The PI's laboratory has discovered a major role of the circulating glycoprotein Angiopoietin-like-4 (Angptl4) in human and experimental nephrotic syndrome. Studies conducted by his team show that circulating Angptl4 is the first molecular link between proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia and hypertriglyceridemia, three major components of nephrotic syndrome. In glomerular disease, increased Angptl4 secretion from skeletal muscle, heart, liver and adipose tissue occurs when proteinuria becomes moderate to severe (in the human context, when it reaches nephrotic range). Circulating Angptl4 reduces proteinuria by binding to glomerular endothelial ?vß5 integrin, while also inducing hypertriglyceridemia by inhibiting the activity of endothelium bound lipoprotein lipase. Further, it appears that this multi-organ upregulation of Angptl4 expression results from an increase in the plasma free fatty acid / albumin ratio. The PI has developed four new mutant forms of human Angptl4 protein that reduce proteinuria in rat models of focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and diabetic nephropathy without significantly affecting plasma triglyceride levels. In Specific Aim 1, the relationship between elevated plasma free fatty acid / albumin ratio with increased peripheral organ Angptl4 expression in nephrotic syndrome will be investigated further using organ specific PPAR knockout mice. In Specific Aim 2, we will test whether administration of mutant human Angptl4 twice every month, or transgenic expression of rat Angptl4 from adipose tissue can reduce glomerulosclerosis and progression of chronic kidney disease in rats models of FSGS or diabetic nephropathy. In Specific Aim 3, mechanisms by which the interaction of circulating Angptl4 with glomerular endothelial ?vß5 integrin reduces proteinuria will be investigated."
"9258834","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Chronic lung disease is one of the leading causes of mortality in the U.S. placing a significant burden on the health care system (>$30 billion currently for COPD). Unfortunately, clinical measurements of lung disease lack sensitivity to early regional disease (spirometry), are invasive (bronchoalveolar lavage), or expose patients to high doses of radiation (computed tomography (CT)). Therefore, a new non-invasive way to safely measure regional lung disease is an important tool for the care and investigation of chronic lung disease.  Quantitative MRI can provide sensitive measurements of lung disease in a non-invasive fashion without ionizing radiation. For example, MR specific parameters (T1, T2*) and perfusion measurements have been shown to be associated with chronic lung disease and declining pulmonary function. The success in clinical imaging of lung disease has created an opportunity to explore animal models of lung disease with quantitative MRI. One major barrier to application of current clinical techniques to preclinical research is the significantly smaller amount of signal available for quantification in mouse lungs due to the ~1000 fold increase in spatial resolution, low spin density in the lungs, and increased magnetic susceptibility on high-field MRI scanners. Overcoming this decrease in signal relies on high field (>7T) MRI systems, small radiofrequency coils for efficient signal detection, and multiple signal averages to provide accurate quantification. The result is impractically long scan times for in vivo quantification of multiple MRI parameters. Therefore, there are currently no methods able to provide multi-parametric MRI measurements in animal models of lung disease.  The MRI research group at CWRU has developed a wholly new platform of imaging techniques termed Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF, Nature 2013). In the initial clinical study MRF simultaneously mapped T1, T2, and M0 in a human brain in ~10 seconds. Prior work has recently extended the MRF methodology to high-field preclinical MRI scanners. In this project, the MRF methodology will be expanded by incorporating ultra-short echo time (UTE) strategies to provide simultaneous multi-parametric MRI quantification (T1, T2, M0) in the lungs of mice in ~1 hour. These UTE-MRF assessments will be validated in in vitro phantoms as well as in established mouse models of lung infection and pulmonary fibrosis. A validated method for making quantitative multi-parametric MRI measurements in mouse models of lung disease will create opportunities for additional studies in a variety of mouse models of lung disease as well as rapid clinical translation to studies in patients."
"9230839","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have developed a powerful mouse model to study visual circuit development in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), the thalamic relay of retinal information to the visual cortex. To date, studies have focused largely on the retinogeniculate pathway and the refinement of connections between retinal ganglion cells and dLGN neurons. While many of the changes in retinogeniculate axon patterning and connectivity have been delineated, information about two fundamental aspects of organization is still lacking. One relates to the cell- class specificity of connections between RGCs and dLGN cells and the other pertains to the source of connections to dLGN cells, namely the wealth of input that arises from nonretinal projections. Both aspects are critical for a contemporary understanding of thalamic function, which is to provide a faithful relay of retinal signals but at the same time to modulate the gain of transmission based on changes in behavioral state. The goals of this proposal are to assess how retinogeniculate refinement relates to class specific connections, whether retinogeniculate refinement proceeds in a way that establishes separable parallel visual channels, to determine when nonretinal projections develop in dLGN, and to assess how such input coordinates with the innervation and refinement of the retinogeniculate pathway. To address these issues, we will conduct anatomical, electrophysiological, and optogenetic experiments in transgenic mice that allow for the visualization and experimental isolation of specific cell types arising from the retina or from such nonretinal sources as layer VI of visual cortex, the thalamic reticular nucleus, and cholinergic nuclei of the brainstem. These studies will provide valuable information about how the developing brain forms precise patterns of connections and offer further insight into the study and treatment of developmental and neurological disorders that result from the formation of abnormal patterns of connectivity."
"9311358","PROJECT SUMMARY The Ebola epidemic that has devastated West Africa evolved within months from a regional humanitarian crisis to a global public health emergency. Over 27,000 infections and more than 11,000 deaths were reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) ? an underestimate that already eclipses the numbers of infections and deaths in all previous Ebola outbreaks combined by orders of magnitude. While this epidemic has ebbed, and may even be over, the clinical complications of Ebola virus disease (EVD) endure for the majority of the thousands of survivors. Our work and that of others indicate that musculoskeletal, neurologic, and ocular complications can persist even two years after recovery from acute Ebola disease. Further, there is evidence that there can be sustained shedding of at least viral RNA in semen and vaginal fluid of survivors, which could signal presence of infectious virus and/or serve to stimulate immune responses that may produce certain post-Ebola symptoms. The small size of previous outbreaks and the absence of adequate infrastructure to collect, process and analyze samples in the field have limited our understanding of the natural history of Ebola survivorship. The primary goal of this proposal is a better understanding of the clinical sequelae of EVD. Specifically: ? In AIM I we will describe and categorize the clinical symptomatology of Ebola survivors and  investigate host- and disease-related factors for these conditions.  ? In AIM II we probe putative pathogenic mechanisms for post-Ebola conditions including sustained  immune activation, altered gut integrity, and persistence of viral antigens in the uro-genital compartment. We will conduct this work in the context of close and strong working relationships with health care leaders and Ebola survivor representatives in West Africa, and a well-developed infrastructure for clinical research we have established in Liberia and Sierra Leone where we have recruited, enrolled, and longitudinally followed and sampled over 400 Ebola survivors. Establishment of these cohorts allowed our team to determine the feasibility of our approach and develop, pilot, and refine the procedures needed to sustain high-quality data collection. This work also allows us to build and support capacity. Staff in both nations have been trained in research methodology and are being encouraged to develop their own proposals. We have established a validated platform for Ebola RNA detection in blood, semen, and vaginal fluid at a national reference lab in Liberia and have trained this site in quality control. Collectively, the proposed work will provide a much-needed characterization of the convalescence from Ebola and its potential mechanisms, as well as better characterize the patterns of Ebola RNA detection in genital fluids. With 25 outbreaks over the past 40 years and a notable increase in the frequency of EVD outbreaks, the question is not if another outbreak will occur but when. This study will ensure that the world is better prepared for the next epidemic through the improved understanding of the clinical complications of Ebola virus disease, and through the implementation of clinical research platforms in areas that are likely to see a recurrence of EVD."
"9433344","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genetic mutation in certain genes causes familial forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Toward understanding the mechanisms of a disease mutation, a critical step is creating a desirable model for research. Whereas cellular models are important for testing some aspects of disease mechanisms, animal model is essential for unraveling the mechanisms of complex neurodegeneration because findings from in vitro studies do not always translate to live animals. When a pathogenic mutation exhibits a dominant trait, animal models are often created by randomly inserting transgenes into host genome, incurring gene-insertional mutation and position effects. The levels and patterns of transgene expression largely depend on position effects and vary from line to line even when two lines carry the same copy of transgenes. The best control for genetic model is the transgenic strain that expresses wildtype form of a disease gene but develops no phenotypes observed in mutant transgenic strain. It is unlikely to obtain two lines that express wildtype and mutant proteins at similar levels and patterns. Authentic mechanisms are often obscured by the drawbacks of traditional transgenics. To avoid gene insertional mutation and unify position effect among individual lines, we will insert single copy of transgene at predetermined intergenic locus and will combine it with Tet-inducible system to amplify transgene expression such that plausible phenotypes can be induced within a rat's lifetime. Using these novel rats, we will examine the mechanisms of hnRNPA1 pathogenesis at a systematic level. We will validate the efficacy of this novel transgenic approach in disease induction by comparing phenotypic expression with those observed in the knockin rats that express disease gene at physiological levels and in its intrinsic patterns."
"9234546","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this proposal we will explore the impact of autophagy, a self-digestion mechanism responsible for maintaining cellular homeostasis under different forms of stress, on dendritic cell development and function. While several recent studies have examined the role of different autophagic genes on selected aspects of dendritic cell biology, we will specifically focus on Beclin 1. Beclin 1 is essential for the early stages of autophagy, but also has several unique roles, such as the recently described roles in phagocytosis and endocytic membrane trafficking. These functions could be essential for antigen uptake from the extracellular environment and presentation to either CD4 T cells or CD8 T cells (cross-presentation) in the context of MHC class II or MHC class I molecules, respectively. We therefore hypothesize that Beclin 1 deficiency would have a profound impact on dendritic cell activation and antigen cross-presentation and we have already generated Beclin 1-deficient mice to address this question. We will first examine if normal development and activation of dendritic cells requires Beclin 1. Beclin 1-deficient dendritic cells will then b analyzed for their ability to process and present extracellular antigens, such as tumor antigens, secrete different cytokines and initiate T cell responses in vivo. These studies should greatly improve our understanding of the processes of activation and antigen processing and presentation in dendritic cells leading to initiation of an effective anti-tumor T cell immune response."
"9262338","Project Summary  Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide, and it is characterized by vast heterogeneity. As approximately 35-50% of adults will experience recurrent episodes, recent research has sought to parse this heterogeneity by focusing on differences among individuals experiencing single episode (sMDD) versus recurrent (recMDD) MDD. Recurrent MDD is associated with increased rates of comorbidity, greater psychosocial dysfunction, and worse treatment response; consequently, identifying mechanisms implicated in recMDD may provide novel clinical targets for early identification and treatment.  The National Institute of Mental Health's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) provides an innovative framework to investigate promising mechanisms that may underlie recMDD. Constructs within the RDoC domains of the Positive Valence System (PVS, e.g., blunted initial reward responsiveness) may be particularly important for the maintenance and recurrence of MDD. However, the majority of this research has relied on monetary as opposed to social reward (e.g., social acceptance) paradigms despite seminal research directly linking social processes to recMDD. The aims of the present study therefore focus on RDoC constructs that intersect PVS and Social Processes (e.g., affiliation) domains. Specifically, the first aim of the study is to utilize an ecologically valid peer feedback task (i.e., peer acceptance vs. rejection) to elicit event-related potentials and associated neural processes that are believed to confer risk for recurrent episodes of depression. For the second aim, an innovative NIH funded, ecological momentary assessment smartphone app (Beiwe) that measures both `active' (e.g., explicit probes of in vivo affect and stress) and `passive' (e.g., frequency of incoming/outgoing text messages and phone calls) data will be used to test whether a blunted response to social reward among recMDD adults predicts psychosocial dysfunction. For the third aim, given that interpersonal stressors are potent predictors of depression recurrence, we will test whether blunted response to social reward in recMDD individuals prospectively predicts interpersonal stressors over a 6-month follow-up period. Ultimately, testing whether social reward processing deficits prospectively predict interpersonal stress and depressive symptoms may elucidate the pathway to depression recurrence.  One limitation of past research on mechanisms of recMDD is that it has largely focused on currently symptomatic individuals. These studies therefore cannot ascertain whether deficits are a function of current symptomatology or whether they also would persist into remission. Thus, the proposed study will test the three aims in remitted recMDD individuals, remitted sMDD individuals, and healthy adults. As a whole, the proposed project has the potential to improve our understanding of neurophysiological markers and social processes that contribute to depression recurrence, which may lead to key developments for early identification and preventative intervention approaches for individuals at risk for depression recurrence."
"9329048","Project Summary/Abstract The process of craniofacial morphogenesis demands the coordinated outgrowth of multiple facial prominences that are initially spatially separated. Underscoring this complex choreography, 1/3 of all human birth defects affect craniofacial development. Specifically, cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P), the most common craniofacial birth abnormality that affects the midface, occurs in 1/500-700 live births. During embryonic development, regulatory genes such as Satb2 and Pbx1 control the dynamics of transcriptional activity, tissue- level patterning, and intercellular signaling to modulate the timing of progenitor proliferation, cell cycle exit, and osteoblast differentiation. Variation in these dynamics underpins both evolutionary variation in midfacial outgrowth and the etiology of craniofacial birth defects. Notably, it has been established that the main variable driving species-specific midfacial length and morphology (prognathism) is the maxillary bone of the upper jaw. Despite the availability of large datasets of regulatory elements generated from mouse, chimp, and human facial tissues and cranial neural crest cells, and despite studies of craniofacial phenotypes in mutant mice, the majority of regulatory networks that control embryonic midfacial outgrowth are still unknown with respect to their spatiotemporal context-dependence during midfacial morphogenesis. This knowledge gap negatively impacts the efforts of human geneticists to identify and map causal mutations associated with human craniofacial pathologies. The goal of these studies is to define the cis-regulatory landscapes underpinning midfacial outgrowth in order to understand how morphogenesis of the craniofacial complex as a whole is coordinated with variation in the growth of specific skeletal elements. This project will employ a vertical gene- centric approach to test the hypothesis that a Satb2/Pbx-dependent regulatory network coordinates morphogenetic cell behaviors and osteoblast differentiation critical for normal maxillary outgrowth. Using available Satb2 and Pbx mutant mice, Aim1a will define the regulatory hierarchy of these genes and their impact on maxillary morphogenesis; Aim1b will establish Satb2/Pbx-dependent genomic networks that drive maxillary outgrowth and differentiation by RNA-Seq assays. Moreover, the hypothesis will be tested that regulatory landscapes of genes critical for craniofacial development show distinct spatiotemporal activity in C57Bl/6J (B6) and PWK/PhJ (PWK) mice, two genetically distinct mouse strains with varying maxillary length. In a parallel genome-wide approach that leverages sequence variation in these two mouse lines Aim2a will produce microCT based morphometry on B6 vs PWK embryonic heads to define their respective maxillary growth trajectories; Aim2b will generate genome-wide annotation of the transcriptional regulatory landscapes in developing skeletal anlagen of mice with different degrees of prognathism by GRO-seq analyses on B6 vs PWK embryonic maxillae. These studies will ultimately define the mechanisms underlying tolerance to morphological variation that separate normal craniofacial development from pathology."
"9207440","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer is characterized by unrestricted, self-renewing cells, eventually forming tumors that deprive healthy tissues of resources. Albeit in a controlled fashion, the ability to self-renew is shared by pluripotent stem cells and naturally present progenitors in the adult. This shared ability to self-propagate led to the hypothesis that progenitor cells may be more apt to transformation into cancer or apt to transform with distinct tumor phenotypes. Work in several tumor types (rhabdomyosarcoma, clear cell sarcoma, etc.) has confirmed the hypothesis, while results in brain cancer contradict. Recent work by other labs has established the presence of multipotent melanocyte progenitors within the epidermis of adult humans, opening up the possibility for melanoma genesis from a more pluripotent and less differentiated cell. Uncovering the importance of cell of origin will test the hypothesis that the ell in which melanoma arises dictates its subsequent clinical behavior; providing insights on treating malignant melanomas based on their cell of origin and not just the bulk population.  To address the impact of the differentiation status of the cell of origin on melanoma this study will utilize two complementary systems: human melanocytes derived from iPS cells and a transgenic zebrafish model of melanoma. We have generated a robust and repeatable protocol for the production of pigmented melanocytes via melanocyte progenitors from human pluripotent cells. We will introduce oncogenic mutations (including BRAFv600e) at defined stages of differentiation and characterize the tumorigenic phenotypes both in vitro and in vivo. To complement the human cell culture work, we will utilize the well-established in vivo zebrafish melanoma model to drive tumorigenesis in cells at each progenitor stage. By expressing BRAFv600e under promoters for lineage specific genes we can query the importance of differentiation status of the cell of origin on melanoma phenotypes in vivo."
"9210118","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mutations in the Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 gene (MeCP2) cause Rett syndrome, an autism spectrum disorder. RTT is hypothesized to result from deficient neuronal maturation and plasticity, possibly through abnormal experience-dependent synapse development and maintenance. MeCP2 has been implicated in chromatin and transcription regulation through binding to methyl-cytosines, which includes 5-methylcytosine (5mC) as well as 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). While 5mC is generally viewed as a silencing mark, 5hmC might represent methylation dynamics and play complex roles in gene regulation. However, the genomic distributions of 5mC and 5hmC in brain cells are poorly characterized, and it is unclear how MeCP2 might interpret 5mC and 5hmC patterns, thereby influencing transcription. It remains controversial whether MeCP2 is primarily a transcriptional repressor that modulates gene-specific targets or act globally in chromatin regulation. Identifying the transcriptional impact is a critical step toward understanding the mechanism of MeCP2 function. Characterizing altered transcription in relevant brain regions, neuron types, developmental and physiological context in mouse models is necessary for unraveling the pathogenic mechanism of RTT. A key challenge in studying the role of MeCP2 in gene regulation in the brain is cellular heterogeneity. For example, it has been difficult to achieve high-resolution mapping of methylome in defined neuron types. Further, nerve cells modify their epigenomes and transcriptomes during development and in response to neuronal input. Thus an additional challenge is to examine functionally relevant cells in an appropriate developmental and plasticity context. We have developed methods and experimental systems for cell-based genomic analysis and for studying MeCP2 in a well established paradigm of cortical plasticity. Our General Hypothesis is that by tracking genome wide 5mC and 5hmC distributions and dynamics, MeCP2 regulates chromatin structures and gene transcription in a cell type- and cell state-dependent manner during experience-dependent neuronal maturation. We will apply cell-based analysis of DNA methylome (including 5mC and 5hmC) and transcriptome to examine the relationship among these profiles in cortical glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons during postnatal maturation. We will then examine the impact of MeCP2 mutations on methylomes and transcriptome in these neurons. We will further examine whether MeCP2 functions as an activity-regulated brake of experience-driven maturation of parvalbumin-positive GABA interneurons, which time the onset and progression of the critical period plasticity in primary visual cortex. Combining cell specificity, base resolution analysis of methylomes and their impact on transcriptomes in a well-defined context of neural development, these studies will provide insight into the regulatory relationships among cytosine methylation, MeCP2 function and gene expression, a fundamental issue in epigenetic regulation of the brain. We aim to reveal the developmental trajectory and genetic architecture of MeCP2 mutation and suggest strategies for intervention for RTT."
"9233001","Cryptosporidiosis is a globally important disease which is underappreciated as a cause of morbidity and mortality in children. It is also common in persons with AIDS and in children with persistent diarrhea who suffer growth retardation and malnutrition. No effective therapy exists. The recent Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) reported that moderate-to-severe diarrheal disease in the pediatric population in 4 sites in sub-Saharan Africa and 3 sites in South Asia, Cryptosporidium was second only to rotavirus as a cause of disease in children < 2 years of age. This application proposes to develop Cryptosporidium vaccines for humans. There are two species of this enteric parasite, C. hominis and C. parvum, both of which cause illness in humans, although C. hominis is more pathogenic and more frequently associated with disease in humans. The gnotobiotic (GB) piglet is the only model that results in diarrhea following challenge with C. hominis, while C. parvum infects all mammals including humans. Piglets that recover from Cryptosporidium diarrhea are significantly protected when re-challenged with the homologous species (Aim 1), and partially protected against C. parvum. We propose to perform a series of studies in piglets to address the fundamental hypothesis that specific antibodies protect against Cryptosporidium. Specific Aim 1: Re-demonstrate that C. hominis or C. parvum diarrheal infection of GB piglets results in active infection-derived immunity that is protective against parasite rechallenge. Specific Aim 2: Determine whether passive transfer of antibodies from immunized sows confers passive protection to their suckling offsprings against challenge with the homologous species. Specific Aim 3: Determine whether passive transfer of circulating or intestinal antibodies from immunized sows can protect GB piglets challenged with homologous or heterologous species. Specific Aim 4: Identify surface antigens of C. hominis and C. parvum sporozoites using immunoproteomics and reverse vaccinology approaches. Serum IgG and milk IgA from Aims 1 and 2 will be used in immunoproteomic techniques to identify antigen targets of these antibodies. Specific Aim 5: Determine whether putative C. hominis and C. parvum protective antigens identified in Aims 4 & 5 will protect GB piglets or mice when administered a) parenterally as purified proteins, b) expressed by a Salmonella Typhi live vector or c) in a prime boost strategy (prime with live vector followed by a boost with purified antigen)."
"9243197","Aging is a major risk factor for both the development of primary tuberculosis (TB) disease and for the conversion of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) infection to active TB disease. As a consequence, persons over the age of 65 have the highest TB case rate and are the most susceptible to TB associated death. The immunological factors that contribute to the increased susceptibility of the elderly to TB remain largely unknown. The overarching hypothesis of this program project is that specific changes in inflammatory pathways (termed inflammaging) mediate unique and sub-optimal re-programming in pulmonary and systemic immunity during aging, and worsen the outcome of M.tb infection in the elderly. Project 1 will analyze how pulmonary surfactant and complement contribute to the loss of alveolar complexity within the aging lung and modify the initial cellular interaction with M.tb. Project 2 will address age-associated changes in the function of alveolar macrophages and how they affect M.tb infection. Project 3 will determine the impact of aging and inflammaging on control of primary and latent M.tb infection in old mice. Project 4 will investigate M.tb specific monocyte and T cell function in elderly subjects with latent or active TB. Altogether, these studies will provide mechanistic information to understand how inflammaging and immune senescence impact M.tb infection in the elderly. The program brings together an established group of collaborative scientists with expertise in clinical TB, TB pathogenesis and the immune response to infection, the latter both in human and animal models."
"9230871","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mutations in human PMP22 cause the most common forms of inherited peripheral nerve diseases, which include hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) with heterozygous deletion of PMP22. Patients with HNPP presents with focal sensory loss and muscle weakness that are related to the conduction block. We have discovered that PMP22 deficiency impairs action potential propagation in the absence of segmental demyelination. This conduction defect is likely resulted from abnormally increased permeability of myelin through disruption of myelin junctions. In the present study, we will investigate how junction complexes are disrupted through their abnormal maintenance in PMP22 deficient nerves. Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that PMP22 deficiency increases actin polymerization at myelin junctions, leading to removal of myelin junction protein complexes.  Our preliminary study has demonstrated a remarkable increase of F-actin overlaps with the areas that show disruption of junction protein complexes. We will utilize genetically labeled F-actin mouse model to track dynamics of F-actin formation. We will further test how PMP22 deficiency activates the actin polymerization. Aim 2: Removal of p21-activated kinase (PAK1) reverses the increase of F-actin in PMP22 deficient nerves, and thereby prevents myelin junction complexes from being disrupted.  Our preliminary results show an abnormal increase of PAK1 activity in Pmp22+/- nerves. Ablation of Pak1 in Pmp22+/- mice reverses abnormal myelin permeability. We will use the double knockout mice (Pmp22+/- /Pak1-/-) to determine whether removal of PAK1 suppresses the formation of F-actin, and dislocation of junction complexes in HNPP mouse model. Moreover, utilizing our newly produced transgenic mouse expressing PAK-inhibiting peptides under the control of inducible Schwann cell-specific cre, we will determine the temporal requirement in rescuing junction abnormalities via PAK inhibition. Aim 3: Systemic administration of PAK1 inhibitor reverses the phenotype in the HNPP mouse model.  A successful reversal of abnormal myelin permeability by deletion of Pak1 in Pmp22+/- mice strongly justifies a therapeutic trial in Pmp22+/- mice using PAK1 inhibitors.  Taken together, these three aims will further substantiate the pathogenic roles of myelin junction disruption and abnormal actin polymerization in HNPP. We are optimistic that a therapy will likely be developed through this study. Because myelin junctions are essential complexes that seal myelin, results derived from this study may have broad applications in other myelin diseases."
"9331837","IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2017 The project provides NIH Student travel and tutorial support to graduate students and Ph.D. candidates in computational bioimaging or closely related areas to attend and participate in the 2017 ISBI conference organized jointly by the IEEE Signal Processing Society (SPS) and Engineering in Medicine and Biology (EMB) in Melbourne, Australia April 18-21, 2017. ISBI participants ? on the order of 600-700 participants from across the world are involved in biomedical imaging research and development, either in academic institutions, government laboratories, or R&D departments of private companies The Objective of ISBI is to bring together both established and young researchers with interests in the mathematical and computational aspects of biomedical imaging, with a focus on addressing problems of significance to the development and application of imaging systems across the spatial scale, from microscopy to whole-body imaging. The forum aims to have an educational component on topics of significant interest to the community in the form of tutorials and plenary talks as well as oral and poster presentations from full paper peer-reviewed submissions competitively selected. In addition, a set of research challenges are also organized and announced which have become very popular over the years. The participating groups in these challenges work on common data sets which can be downloaded from the challenge website and results are reported in special challenge sessions organized prior to start of the conferece. The research methods typically presented at the meeting include physical, biological and statistical modeling, image formation and reconstruction, computational image analysis, statistical image analysis, visualization, and image quality assessment.. ISBI, like other IEEE SPS and EMBS conferences, requires submission and review of a 4-page papers which are peer-reviewed much like journal articles, peer reviews handled by a 50 member editorial board (area editors) who are leading experts in the community who in turn assign papers to reviewers through an electronic paper handling system. The area editors recommend acceptance/rejection of papers with the final decision made by program chairs. IEEE anticipates that the primary impact of this R13 grant program will be increased student and postdoctoral fellow attendance to both the main conference and the tutorials. By offering to cover a portion of attendees travel expenses, we allow students to propose to her/his mentors or departmental administration that the cost-to-benefit ratio for attending ISBI will be extremely favorable. The benefits can largely be summarized as ?exposure? and education. ISBI provides the opportunity for students to be exposed to many more areas of computational imaging research than those to which one is generally exposed to in her/his home institution, and concurrently it provides the opportunity for the students to hear and interact with the world leaders in the field through tutorials, plenary, oral, and poster presentations, lunches with leaders, and individual discussions. Through submission and presentation of a research paper, a young investigator will gain the experience of presenting her/his research to others for critical evaluation and dissemination. But, it is also informal interactions during the breaks where detailed discussions take place and life-long friendships are formed."
"9226051","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objective of the proposed project is to improve the prognosis of patients with myocardial ischemia caused by coronary artery disease (CAD) or coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD). Early diagnosis of myocardial ischemia caused by CAD is important as both coronary revascularization and medical therapies can significantly reduce morbidity and mortality. CMD is a major cause for myocardial ischemia in the absence of obstructive CAD, particularly in women, due to abnormalities in coronary microcirculation. First- pass myocardial perfusion cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is a highly promising technique for detecting regional blood flow deficits caused by ischemia. It does not require ionizing radiation and provides higher spatial resolution than nuclear imaging. Dynamic images acquired during intravenous vasodilator stress delineate regions associated with myocardial ischemia. Despite considerable technical improvements and clinical experience, a recent multicenter multivendor study (MR-IMPACT II) shows that while the sensitivity of CMR to detect ischemia caused by CAD is superior to SPECT (67% vs 59%), specificity is inferior (61% vs 72%). Both sensitivity and specificity of CMR remain relatively low indicating substantial false positive and false negative diagnoses. Several studies using MBF CMR have shown that abnormal MBF can be used to detect ischemia caused by CMD. However, these studies have shown only moderate diagnostic accuracy, indicating the need for major improvements. Major technical limitations of MBF CMR that contribute to inaccurate diagnoses of CAD and CMD include: (i) image artifacts, such as dark rim artifact (DRA) and cardiac and respiratory motion-induced artifacts, which reduce the image quality and diagnostic accuracy; (ii) incomplete coverage of the LV for evaluating total ischemic burden; (iii) inadequate spatial resolution for reliable detection of subendocardial perfusion deficits; and (iv) errors in AIF estimation for flow quantification due to saturation of blood signal intensity at pea enhancement. In the proposed project, we will develop novel techniques to address these limitations (Aim 1). The techniques will be rigorously validated in animals using microsphere measurements as the reference (Aim 2). Finally, the techniques will be tested in CAD and CMD patients using PET and invasive coronary reactivity testing as reference, respectively (Aim 3). The end point of the project is the development and rigorous validation of a new myocardial perfusion quantification CMR method with whole-heart coverage, high isotropic resolution, cardiac phase-resolved acquisition, accurate arterial input estimation while without the requirements of ECG triggering or breath-hold. It is expected that such a technique will significantly improve image quality, reduce technical failures, increase the diagnostic accuracy, and facilitate the eventual adoption of myocardial perfusion CMR as the method of choice for detecting myocardial ischemia. ."
"9233749","Project I. piRNA function in epigenetic inheritance. Craig Mello, P.I. Project summary Darwin recognized that evolution by natural selection required two self-evident but entirely mysterious biological mechanisms: (i) a property of inheritance such that offspring share features of parents, and (ii) a source of variation so that novel inherited features, adaptations, can arise. The discovery of Mendelian genetics and of the structure and properties of DNA seemed to solve these mysteries, creating the widely held DNA-centric view of inheritance. However, beginning with Barbara McClintock's classic work on variegation in maize, a growing field of epigenetics has begun to reveal how RNA and chromatin can contribute to inheritance. Recently, we have shown that an RNAi-related small-RNA pathway called the Piwi pathway can initiate a very stable transgenerational mode of epigenetic silencing in the C. elegans germline. Remarkably, this pathway involves piRNA signals that constitute not only a memory (and enforcer) of gene silencing but also involves an epigenetic memory (and protector) of expressed germline genes. PIWI Argonautes and their small RNA cofactors (piRNAs) are conserved regulators of germline development in animals. piRNA-pathway mutants exhibit embryonic lethality and partial or complete deficits in fertility, characterized by under- proliferated germlines and activation of transposable elements. While the role of piRNAs in transposon silencing is well established, how piRNAs promote germ cell development and function is not understood. Here we propose a set of genetic, biochemical and bioinformatic studies to further characterize and understand: 1) the molecular mechanisms and outcomes of targeting by PIWI/piRNA complexes, 2) the specificity of individual PIWIs, and 3) the epigenetic functions of piRNA pathways. Insights from parallel projects in the laboratories of Drs. Theurkauf and Zamore, with informatics-based model building by the Weng lab, will inform this analysis and provide new tools and methods for probing piRNA activities and downstream functions. Relevance These studies will advance our basic understanding of piRNA function in fertility and epigenetic inheritance, and should guide our understanding of how related pathways protect the human genome, maintain somatic cells, and promote the pluripotency and immortality of germ cells."
"9238806","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microglia, the brain's resident immune cells and phagocytes, are emerging as critical regulators of developing synaptic circuits in the healthy brain. Recent studies from our lab and others indicate that microglia engulf synapses in the developing brain; however, how microglia know which synapses to target remains a major open question.  Our previous work demonstrates that microglia-mediated pruning underlies developmental synaptic refinement, an essential process required for the formation of mature circuits in which weak or inappropriate synapses are eliminated and remaining connections are maintained and strengthened. We found that microglial engulfment of presynaptic inputs is activity-dependent and driven by complement molecules C1q and C3, and microglial complement receptor CR3. These molecules are innate immune eat me signals known for promoting macrophage phagocytosis of apoptotic cells or debris, and mice lacking these signals exhibit reduced microglial engulfment of synaptic inputs and impaired refinement. This suggests that microglia-mediated pruning may be analogous to the removal of non-self material by phagocytes in the immune system. However, we do not yet know how microglia precisely determine which inputs to engulf and which to avoid, an important decision regarding the specificity needed to sculpt precise, mature connections.  We propose that protective don't eat me signals are required to prevent inappropriate microglial engulfment of necessary connections during synaptic refinement, just as they prevent inappropriate engulfment of healthy self-cells by phagocytes during an immune response. Our preliminary data support this hypothesis, as don't eat me signals CD47 and SIRP? are present in the developing brain and required to prevent excess microglial engulfment of synaptic inputs. We will investigate the anatomical, functional, and behavioral abnormalities in mice lacking CD47 and SIRP? to better understand the consequences of excess microglial engulfment. We will also investigate whether and how these don't eat me signals are regulated by activity to determine if they direct microglia to engulf specific synapses in an activity-dependent manner. Finally, as don't eat me signals are known to be downregulated in the brains of patients with neurodegenerative diseases, we will examine whether these molecules are dysregulated in mouse models of Huntington's disease (HD) and could thereby underlie synapse loss caused by aberrant microglial engulfment.  This study would be the first to demonstrate that synaptic protection is required to prevent inappropriate microglial engulfment of necessary connections during development. This research program will provide insight not only into the mechanisms regulating microglial engulfment of specific synapses, but also into possible mechanisms underlying synapse loss in CNS neurodegenerative diseases."
"9192806","PROJECT SUMMARY Patients treated with dialysis report very low levels of physical activity, and physical activity correlates with functional status, which is also impaired in the dialysis population. In the general population, higher levels of physical activity are associated with lower cardiovascular risk and better endothelial function. There are recommended levels of physical activity for the general population that are known to improve both cardiovascular risk and endothelial function. Although there are international guidelines for physical activity in patients treated with dialysis, the activity targets (which are derived from evidence in non-dialysis populations) are not being met. Prior exercise studies in the dialysis population have focused on aerobic training or resistance training and have shown improvement in physical functioning, but very few studies have actually targeted increasing physical activity. The moderate to vigorous interventions studied may limit participation for many dialysis patients. The major goal of this study is to determine whether a pedometer-based intervention can increase physical activity among patients on dialysis and whether increasing activity can improve physical and endothelial function, and symptom severity. We propose a 3-month randomized controlled trial comparing pedometers and weekly activity goals to usual care among 60 patients on dialysis, with a 6 month-follow up for maintenance. Our research approach and study design allow for measurement of change over time not only in the intervention group but in the standard of care group, in an area for which little longitudinal data exists. Our study could establish an important and actionable link between exercise, endothelial function, and cardiovascular health in this complicated population.  "
"9420686","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression through their interactions with DNA sequences in the genome. The goals of this project are to continue developing approaches and data sets for understanding the DNA binding specificities of TFs and to identify the effects of coding polymorphisms within TFs' DNA binding domains on their DNA binding preferences. Identification of TFs' DNA binding specificities is important in understanding transcriptional regulatory networks, in particular in the prediction of cis regulator modules, inference of cis regulatory codes, and interpretation of in vivo TF binding data and gene expression data. Identification of the DNA binding effects of such polymorphic TF variants will be essential in studies aimed at understanding the gene regulatory effects resulting from natural genetic variation. This project will focus on human TFs, with an emphasis on those with known mutations or polymorphisms identified in exome or whole-genome sequencing projects. Our results will provide data that will likely be of importance to other systems, and more generally, our data, approaches, technologies, and database will be useful not only for human TFs but also for model organism studies. Specifically, we will: (1) develop a computational pipeline to predict the effects of coding mutations or polymorphisms within TF DNA binding domains (DBDs) for TFs of major structural classes; (2) determine the DNA binding specificities of mutant TFs designed to test our computational pipeline; (3) experimentally determine the effects of known mutations or coding polymorphisms within human TF DBDs; (4) further develop and maintain the UniPROBE database of universal protein binding microarray (PBM) data on TFs' DNA binding specificities."
"9240975","PROJECT SUMMARY While the effect of stress on ethanol consumption has been extensively studied in several animal models, these studies have generally yielded equivocal findings, with results dependent on a number of factors including the type of stressor used, timing of stress presentation, and initial ethanol preference. During the current funding period, work conducted in this Core has focused on examining the interaction of stress with drinking in a model of dependence that involves repeated cycles of chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure. Studies demonstrated that repeated brief forced swim stress (FSS) exposure administered prior to ethanol drinking sessions produced a significant increase in ethanol drinking in CIE-exposed mice, but did not alter ethanol intake in nondependent mice. This reliable and robust FSS-induced selective enhancement of drinking in dependent mice produced a nearly 3-fold increase in blood ethanol levels. Interestingly, other stress procedures (e.g., restraint, foot-shock, social defeat) did not produce this effect, suggesting that FSS interacts with CIE exposure in a unique manner to promote further increases in ethanol drinking. Thus, this CIE-FSS drinking model is ideally suited to evaluate potential medications that may not only reduce excessive dependence-related drinking, but also temper the ability of stress to further enhance this elevated drinking. Accordingly, a major function of this Stress-CIE Drinking Mouse Core is to utilize the CIE-FSS Drinking model as a behavioral platform to evaluate medication effects on ethanol consumption in male and female dependent and nondependent mice. Medications selected for evaluation are based on their purported ability to target anti- stress and neuroinflammatory processes implicated in excessive alcohol consumption, thereby enabling the Core to provide service to the translational objectives of research projects in the INIAstress and INIAneuroimmune Consortia. Another function of the Core is to distribute brain tissue samples to INIA investigators to facilitate more comprehensive genomic and neural investigations in relation to the model. This, in turn, will facilitate new discoveries of potential novel targets and treatment strategies that can be tested in this Core. Taken together, the proposed research plan for the Stress-CIE Drinking Mouse Core will provide valuable service to the INIAstress and INIAneuroimmune Consortia, as well as the general alcohol research field. The overall goal of the Stress-CIE Drinking Mouse Core is to facilitate and aid in the identification and development of new treatment approaches for reducing stress-related excessive drinking and, more broadly, alcohol use disorders."

This fee-for service Core consists of two Sub-cores, the Animal Surgery and Experimental Procedure Sub-core and the Analytical Sub-core, each of which contains specialized equipment and key personnel to help DRC investigators and/or their trainees achieve their tasks in the most efficient and cost-effective manner. It also serves as a forum for collaboration between members with different research backgrounds but a common interest in studying diabetes. Through the Animal Surgery and Experimental Procedure Sub-core, DRC investigators can access training courses, equipment, laboratory facilities and technical expertise to perform surgeries for stereotaxis and the placement of vascular catheters and other implantables, as well as carry  out complex metabolic studies using specialized experimental methodologies (e.g. glucose clamps, tracers, microdialysis and amperometric studies) in conscious rodents - skills that are not easily accessible to investigators without previous training or experience. The Analytical Sub-core provides DRC members with a central facility for the measurement of glucoregulatory hormones, cytokines and neurotransmitters derived from the animal studies. This component of the Physiology Core benefits from the expertise and equipment  of an on-going and prolific radioimmunoassay and HPLC facility which has recently incorporated Luminex technology and tandem mass spectrometry for measuring cytokines and neurotransmitters, respectively. In addition, DRC investigators can now profile a focused panel of genes using PCR array technology through this sub-core. Together, these two sub-cores provide DRC members with the unique opportunity to systematically address pertinent mechanistic questions in vivo and to assess metabolic changes in both the  central nervous system and peripheral tissues in the most efficient and economical manner."

"9241443","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term goal is to use genetic tools to improve understanding, prevention, and treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders. The objective of this proposal is to use genetic-expression networks to identify genes responsible for CNV-associated behavioral phenotypes. The central hypothesis is that expression dysregulation of one or multiple genes in a CNV region may contribute to phenotypic expression and this can be explored by expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) and association analysis. In support of this hypothesis, preliminary data show that 16p11.2-related phenotypes show brain-specific association with eQTL networks of 16p11.2 genes. This proposal comprises a novel transcriptomics approach to identify gene expression dysregulation effects underlying neurobehavioral phenotypes by: 1) generating eQTL networks for each gene within or bordering a CNV of interest, 2) testing each eQTL network for association with relevant phenotypes in idiopathic disease datasets and EMR-linked biorepositories, and 3) utilizing eQTL network and association results to address biological questions. We expect to gain insight into how CNVs containing many brain genes influence neurodevelopment. Our unique approach enabled by preliminary data and powerful biorepositories may identify biological pathways through which CNVs cause neuropathogenicity and by extension may lead to novel hypothesized modifiers of relevant endophenotypes that could be explored in the future."
"9227366","Shotgun method for massive mutational interrogation of the entire human genome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Massive mutational interrogation of the entire genome of an organism is a powerful genetic tool; it has fueled forward genetic studies in model organisms for several decades with great success. Since a substantial fraction of human genes is multi-functional, traditional knockout/knockdown approaches invariably perturb all functions of such genes. In contrast, massive mutational interrogation allows separating distinct functions of genes, as is routinely done in model organisms. Revolutionary CRISPR-Cas technology has provided a long- missing tool for introducing mutations into the human genome, enabling the era of human genome-wide mutational forward genetics.  Unfortunately, all CRISPR-based genome interrogation approaches have one significant limitation: they are only as comprehensive as the sgRNA libraries that they employ. To date, technical limitations have constrained the sizes of even the largest reported CRISPR sgRNA libraries to about 105 sgRNAs, precluding dense mutational interrogation of the entire human genome. In contrast, ultra-high throughput FACS-based screening methods (including our Fireworks method) provide tremendous screening capacity for fluorescence- based phenotypes. This screening capacity vastly exceeds the sizes of existing sgRNA libraries, enabling a fundamental change in the way the human diploid genome is interrogated.  I am demonstrating proof-of-principle of the Shotgun method for in-vivo mutational analysis of the entire human genome. The Shotgun method increases the genome-wide density of CRISPR-based mutational interrogation more than 400-fold over existing methods. First, the genome is densely targeted with billions of different sgRNAs, creating an immense library of mutations. Then, phenotypes of the resulting mutants are interrogated individually using high-speed FACS sorting. The lentiviral sgRNA library I constructed is 4(!) orders of magnitude larger than the largest reported sgRNA libraries; its diversity is constrained by the theoretical limit of the sequence space of random 16-mers within sgRNAs (416 = 4.3x109). I developed a protocol and currently use an efficient screening of this library in vivo to identify sgRNAs that inhibit nonsense- mediated decay (NMD); I demonstrate completion of one FACS screening round of 5.2x109 (5.2 billion) individual randomized sgRNAs in human (diploid) cells in just 4 days. By virtue of its design, the Shotgun method interrogates the entire 3.2 Gb of the human genome, on average, every 48 base pairs. As a result, Shotgun targets all known and unknown genomic elements: exons, introns, promoters, 3?? UTRs, as well as non-coding and intergenic regions, providing the most unbiased and comprehensive tool for mutational analysis of the diploid human genome to date.  This project aims to capitalize on the immense mutational coverage of the human genome provided by the Shotgun approach by identifying, analyzing, and validating the resulting hits for their roles in the NMD pathway."
"9397350","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed work aims to improve the quality of pediatric and fetal neuroimaging MRI data acquired without sedation and anesthesia through the development and clinical evaluation of novel MRI pulse sequences. Sedation and anesthesia account for a significant percentage of the cost of pediatric neuroimaging MRI studies, and increase both the risk to the patient and the time required for a scan. Although some clinical neuroimaging studies are attempted without sedation, success is not consistent and the resulting image quality is often considered marginal. In the research setting, MRI is frequently not available to study children because the risks of sedation are not ethically justifiable; this limits the use of MRI for studying development and pediatric disease. In fetal MRI, motion results in degraded data and longer scan sessions. The research aims of this proposal provide a sequence of development and testing stages designed to produce high-speed motion-corrected MRI pulse sequences to address these issues. The first step in creating the proposed sequences is the addition of volumetric navigators to a selection of clinical MRI sequences that have been tailored to gain the maximum savings in time from modern high- channel-count coil arrays. The navigators embedded in these sequences will be used to track the motion of the subject's head during scanning and automatically update the scanner's imaging coordinates in real time. Additionally, portions of the scan that are detected to be degraded by subject motion will be automatically reacquired. The second stage of the project consists of developing novel high-speed image registration software that will improve the accuracy of the motion tracking. These first stages of development work will take place mostly at the Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical imaging, taking advantage of its engineering resources, 7 large-bore MRI scanners, and the large pool of collaborators in MRI physics, pulse sequence programming, and medical image analysis algorithms. Additional pilot testing during the development phase will be performed with pediatric volunteers on the clinical MRI systems at Boston Children's Hospital (BCH). As a third stage, when the sequence development is complete, we propose to validate the tools using a clinical trial at BCH, with the goal of demonstrating improvements in quality and efficiency in pediatric subjects scanned without sedation. This clinical trail will take advantage of the child life, nursing, radiology technologis, radiologist, and research support staff in Radiology and the Fetal Neonatal Neuroimaging & Developmental Science Center at BCH. The project will also proceed to a pilot study applying this technology to fetal neuroimaging via the development of a fetal-specific high-speed motion-corrected sequence - this population is unique in that competing optical- and probe-based motion-correction systems cannot be applied, making the use of navigated sequences particularly attractive. Together, these steps will advance the candidate's long-term career goal of becoming an independent researcher focused on developing novel MRI technology and translating advances into clinical and neuroscience research practice. The development work during this period will help solidify Dr. Tisdall's knowledge of pulse sequence programming and MRI physics. It will also give him the opportunity to study more deeply in medical image analysis techniques such as registration and segmentation. These technical skills will be of use to his future research career goals. Additionally, the process of designing and implementing a clinical trial study will be essential to Dr. Tisdall's future goal of developing technology with direct cliical impact. Thus, the clinical trial portion of this proposal will provide invaluable exposure to these tasks while collaborating with more senior researchers. Finally, the results gathered from the study will help direct future work by Dr. Tisdall, suggesting new theoretical advances to address clinical imaging issues. In addition to the significant research component of the proposal, there is also an initial two-year mentored career development phase in which Dr. Tisdall will spend a 25% of his time on tasks selected to help him become a successful independent researcher in medical imaging. As part of this period, Dr. Tisdall will attend courses in neuroanatomy and disease, and clinical trial design at Harvard Medical School and MIT, and participate in career development seminars at Massachusetts General Hospital and BCH. He will also have a 4-week clinical experience period at Children's Hospital Boston, where he will shadow Dr. Ellen Grant and observe both MRI scanning sessions and image reading. Together these direct training components are designed to broaden Dr. Tisdall's knowledge of clinical and research neuroimaging practices, the delivery of clinical care, and the development and management of clinical research. Dr. Tisdall will also receive regular mentorship and feedback on research, academic, and career development topics via weekly meetings with Drs. Bruce Fischl and Andr? van der Kouwe, and monthly meetings with Dr. Lawrence Wald at the Martinos Center. He will also have biweekly meetings with Dr. Ellen Grant at BCH. Every six months Drs. Fischl and Grant will evaluate Dr. Tisdall's research and career development progress, and meet with him to provide feedback. Through these two years of mentored development, Dr. Tisdall will hone his technical skills, and substantially develop his clinical and study-design knowledge, preparing his transition to independence."
"9349058","PROJECT SUMMARY Worldwide more than 90% of all HIV infections occur via mucosal route. The gastrointestinal tract is a site of massive CD4 T-cell depletion, viral infection, enterocyte apoptosis, disruption of epithelial tight junctions leading to microbial translocation, and lymphoid tissue fibrosis. The SIV infected rhesus macaque (RM) model is considered a well-accepted model to study of HIV-associated enteropathy and we have recently discovered that intestinal epithelial cell (iEC) apoptosis and diminished iEC regeneration occur soon after SIV-infection. Internalization of IL-10R with the resultant impact on IL-10 signaling and dysregulation of the IL-10-mediated anti-inflammatory responses also play a crucial role in iEC damage and subsequent SIV pathogenesis. Understanding the aberrant iEC regeneration in HIV/SIV might lead to an alternative approach for the treatment of HIV-mediated enteropathy based on enhancing iEC repair mechanisms. In the small intestine, each intestinal villus is encircled by at least six crypts of Lieberkühn, which house dedicated populations of stem and progenitor cells that self-renew, as well as give rise to the various differentiated iECs. LGR5+ (Leu- rich repeat containing G protein-coupled receptor 5) was identified as the marker for crypt base columnar (CBC) stem cells that was selectively expressed at the base of adult intestinal crypts. Genetic analysis of LGR5+ intestinal stem cells (ISCs) revealed that a single stem cell leads to crypt homeostasis in adult intestines by clonal expansion. Stem cells give rise to the polarized enterocytes, goblet cells, enteroendocrine cells, and tuft cells that migrate up to the villi after passing through several transiently-amplifying (TA) stages. TA cells also terminally differentiate into Paneth cells (PCs), a highly specialized secretory cell type which intersperse with stem cells at the base of the crypts in the small intestine. Recent cell ablation and co-culture studies showed that PCs provide essential niche signals to support LGR5+ stem cell renewal and survival. Therefore, we hypothesize that HIV/SIV infection disrupts the communication between LGR5+ ISC and PCs leading to diminished iECs regeneration. In Aim 1, we will define the correlates of LGR5+ stem cells and PCs with SIV/HIV infection status. In Aim 2, we will uncover the alterations of ISCs and PCs communication in SIV infection in two sub aims. In Sub-Aim 2a, we will determine the transcriptional programming of ISCs and PCs in normal and SIV infected RMs. In Sub-Aim 2b, we will compare the colony forming efficiency of rhesus intestinal LGR5+ stem cells between SIV infected and normal RMs."
"9310583","Cancer progression is associated with a profound alteration in ?emergency? myelopoiesis, leading to recruitment of mostly immunosuppressive cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and tumor- associated macrophages (TAM). In response to saturating amounts of tumor-induced colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), myeloid progenitors divide more frequently to sustain the hematopoietic output necessary to promote emergency myelopoiesis. Despite the knowledge about the involvement of cytokines and transcription factors in emergency myelopoiesis, the molecular mechanisms by which the cytokines induce transcriptional events regulating cancer-driven myelopoiesis remain largely unclear. Our preliminary data show that G protein signaling modulator-3 (GPSM3) is upregulated selectively in MDSC, either from tumor- bearing hosts or generated from bone marrow myeloid progenitors by the cytokines G-CSF, GM-CSF and IL-6. GPSM3-deficient myeloid progenitors display a reduced capacity to differentiate into granulocytes/monocytes following G-CSF/GM-CSF stimulation. Decreased accumulation of MDSC in GPSM3-deficient tumor-bearing hosts is linked with an altered expression in the key transcriptional mediators of myeloid progenitor commitment and differentiation to the granulocytic/monocytic lineage. Moreover, the immunoregulatory activity of both tumor-induced and cytokine-induced MDSC is dependent on GPSM3. These results have led to the novel hypothesis that GPSM3 is a master regulator of cancer-associated myelopoiesis and key driver of the differentiation of MDSCs for both immune suppression and tumor promotion. In this proposal, we will characterize further the phenotype and function of MDSC in the tumor microenvironment, and explore the signaling pathways implicated by GPSM3 in regulating MDSC differentiation and activation using both gain-of-function and loss-of- function approaches."

"9234469","?     DESCRIPTION OF THE OVERALL U19 APPLICATION (provided by applicant): This application requests funding of a NAMSED Cooperative Research Center (called CRC for simplicity) in the Texas Medical Center. This CRC's primary objective will be achieved through the collaborative efforts of a multidisciplinary, integrated team of basic scientists, biomedical engineers and a physician scientist who are at three institutions (Baylor College of Medicine (BCM), Rice University, the MD Anderson Cancer Center). The overall goal of this CRC is to create the first ex-vivo mini-gut model systems that are physiologically active and mimic many aspects of human intestine. We will use human intestinal enteroids (HIEs) derived from human intestinal biopsies to address key questions about human enteric disease caused by microorganisms that produce human diarrheal disease and lead to ~4% of all deaths worldwide. New models that adequately reflect relevant human physiology, pathophysiology and natural host-pathogen interactions are critically needed because most human pathogens that cause diarrheal disease lack animal models that accurately mimic the human disease. This CRC application integrates a team with multidisciplinary expertise including basic and translational research and innovation in virology, bacteriology including the microbiome, genomics, developmental biology and physiology, biomedical engineering and biomaterial development of engineered tissues including in vitro vascularization and 3D printing, infectious disease epidemiology and clinical microbiology. This CBC will consist of 3 Projects and 3 Core facilities. Project 1 will use HIEs to analyze genetically-regulated host restriction to human rotavirus and vaccine replication and to define epithelial cell responses that lead to pathophysiology. Project 2  will use HIEs to understand the pathogenesis of infections with diarrheagenic E. coli including factors that characterize differences between acute and chronic infections, tissue tropism and mechanisms of pathology. Project 3 will combine tissue engineering, biomaterial design, and mechanobiology to develop tailored, biofunctional platforms for HIEs that can be mechanically stimulated and that will promote cell and tissue polarity as well as the full crypt-villus differentiation to facilitate infection with commensals and enteropathogens. These 3 interrelated and synergistic projects will be supported by the specialized and intellectual contributions of 3 Core Facilities: the Administrative Core, Human Enteroid Core, and Genomics and Microbiome Core. Two Pilot Developmental Research Projects will be supported with one being funded by BCM. The success of this CRC depends on the complementary expertise of the individual investigators and center leaders who are senior scientists-administrators experienced in directing interactive, multidisciplinary programs. Collaboration and iterative feedback between biomedical engineers, local biologists and other NAMSED investigators will facilitate progress towards developing an ideal system that will be state of the art yet sufficiently simple for routin use in infectious disease laboratories and adequately robust for use in pre-clinical studies."
"9257757","CDKL5 disorder is a devastating neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by early-onset seizures, intellectual disability, and autistic-like features. It is caused by mutations in a single X-linked gene, cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) and affects predominantly heterozygous girls but also some hemizygous boys. Studies have shown the CDKL5 protein to be localized, at least in part, to the excitatory synapse, and that it interacts with proteins of the postsynaptic density. Interestingly, CDKL5 protein expression rises significantly in the postnatal period, correlating with the time window of synaptogenesis. However, the in vivo consequences of CDKL5 loss on excitatory synapse development and function remain unclear. In this project, I propose to investigate the cell-autonomous functions of CDKL5 in vivo in excitatory neurons, through the generation of a cell type-specific knockout mouse line (Nex-cKO). Given my preliminary data on altered dendritic spine density and excitatory synaptic function in adult Nex-cKO mice, I propose additional experiments to characterize the consequences of CDKL5 loss on synapse development and animal behavior."
"9439926","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The liver plays a vital role in maintaining blood glucose levels, in part, through gluconeogenic processes. Gluconeogenesis is an energy costly process that is supported through fat oxidation in hepatic mitochondria. The TCA cycle serves as a hub where acetyl-CoA from the break down of fatty acids and carbohydrates meet for oxidation to CO2 and the production of 3 NADH and 1 FADH2. Not only does the TCA cycle support gluconeogenesis through the formation of reducing equivalents that fuel the electron transport chain, but it also provides gluconeogenic substrates through cataplerotic processes. Changes in substrate concentration and redox state modulate TCA cycle flux and anaplerotic/cataplerotic processes. However, the mechanisms regulating this metabolic response remain to be elucidated. In pathological conditions such as obesity and insulin resistance, TCA cycle flux and gluconeogenesis are elevated, contributing to the inappropriately high endogenous glucose production often observed in insulin resistant individuals. Still, it is no known how the TCA cycle is regulated in this diseased state. Many metabolic processes are sensitive to the energy state, and energy sensors, such as AMPK and Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) may be responsible for coordinating the response of these metabolic processes to changes in energy charge. AMPK is an energy sensor that is activated in response to high AMP:ATP ratios. In response, AMPK stimulates catabolic processes, such as fatty acid oxidation to replenish ATP. Specific Aim 1 will use ex vivo and in vivo experiments, with and without the regulatory capacity of AMPK to determine whether AMPK is responsible for changes in TCA cycle flux and cataplerotic/anaplerotic processes in response to changes in substrate concentration (ex vivo), or in an obese, insulin resistant state (in vivo). It is hypothesized that AMPK will be necessary for increases in TCA cycle flux in response to increases in substrate concentrations and that TCA cycle flux and anaperotic/cataplerotic processes will be elevated in AMPK-KO mice in response to 16 week HFD, but that constitutively active AMPK will restore the flux of these processes. SIRT3 is a mitochondrial deactylase that is activated by changes in the redox state (high NAD+/NADH) and responds by deacetylating mitochondrial proteins involved in metabolic processes. Specific Aim 2 will examine whether SIRT3 regulates the response of TCA cycle flux and cataplerotic/anaplerotic processes to changes in redox state (ex vivo) and in the obese insulin resistant state (in vivo). I hypothesize that SIRT3 will be required for normal TCA cycle flux and anaplerotic/cataplerotic processes. The findings from this research will expand our knowledge of the role of energy sensors, and the function of TCA cycle flux and anaplerotic/cataplerotic processes in both healthy and diseased states. These results may provide future targets for pharmaceutical companies to treat or prevent NAFLD and/or insulin resistance."
"9231370","The filoviruses are NIAID/CDC Category A biodefense pathogens that cause severe and rapidly progressing hemorrhagic fever with 50-90% human lethality. There are currently no FDA-approved vaccines or therapies for filovirus infection. Among the filoviruses, the Zaire Ebola virus species (EBOV) has been most extensively characterized. However, outbreaks ofthe Sudan Ebola virus species (SUDV) and Marburg virus (MARV) have been occurring with increased frequency and can be just as lethal as EBOV. Further, the pathogenic Bundibugyo Ebola virus species (BDBV) re-emerged in 2012 with increased lethality. Immunotherapy was recently demonstrated to provide post-exposure protection to EBOV challenge in nonhuman primates (NHPs). For MARV, convalescent sera from immunized NHPs can provide similar protection, suggesting that immunotherapy for all filoviruses will be tractable in humans. A robust pipeline of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting EBOV exists and will be developed in Project 1, but the pipeline for SUDV and MARV mAbs is less complete. Not a single SUDV or MARV mAb or mAb cocktail therapy has been evaluated in NHPs. Currently, there are no neutralizing BDBV mAbs. The goal of Project 2 is to fill these gaps in the filovirus therapeutic mAb portfolio. Among consortium investigators, a total of 216 murine mAbs against SUDV or MARV are available but have not been completely characterized; we will develop these mAbs and evaluate them for protection in rodent models and NHPs. In addition, we will identify new SUDV and MARV mAbs from human survivors of infection from outbreaks in Uganda, especially those in 2012. The consortium investigators have unprecedented access to four separate survivor cohorts of SUDV and MARV infection, and have demonstrated recently that neutralizing mAbs exist in peripheral blood of survivors. In addition, we will identify and characterize new anti-BDBV and broadly reactive anti-filovirus mAbs. Preliminary ELISA studies indicate that antibodies with cross-reactivity for the envelope glycoprotein (GP) from SUDV, BDBV and (in some cases) EBOV exist in peripheral blood of survivors who have been exposed to only a single filovirus species. We will use human hybridoma and antibody phage display technologies to screen the lymphocytes of survivors of filovirus infection for new BDBV and cross neutralizing filovirus mAbs. The most promising candidates will be further evaluated in rodent and nonhuman primate challenge models. The end-point of this work will be a robust pipeline of mAbs for these understudied and re-emerging filoviruses."

"9438299","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive renewal of NIH T32 DK-07519 entitled: Regulation of Hematopoietic Cell Production which is currently in its 30th year of funding. The discipline of stem cells and hematopoiesis has led to numerous discoveries that have enhanced our understanding of blood cells and the treatment of non-malignant and malignant disorders. However, to advance the field, we must train the next generation of investigators in this area. The aim of this program is to continue to train this next generation of  scientists in the clinically-relevant medical area of stem cells and hematopoiesis for effective modulation of normal and abnormal cell growth and to correct blood diseases. We request 4 pre- and 5 post-doctoral slots, for this competitive renewal. We have an outstanding group of 26 very productive, interactive, and well-respected investigators as mentors with their primary and/or secondary faculty appointments in 8 departments of the medical school. These mentors have over their career trained 190 pre- doctoral and 361 MD/PhD post-doctoral students. Since 2005, we were able to train and/or are in the process of training 15 pre- and 22 post-doctoral students, who have published 158 papers [72 (Pre-Doc) and 86 (Post-Doc)].

"9386996","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The area of developmental neuroscience and psychopathology is a rapidly growing domain with great potential to inform the understanding of the causal pathways and mechanisms of mental illness. The division of Child Psychiatry at Washington University School of Medicine is well poised to launch this novel post-doctoral fellowship based on already established innovations related to this domain, as well as the range of related expertise offered by the proposed multidisciplinary mentor group. From a public health perspective, an infusion of new research scientists in the area of developmental neuroscience and psychopathology is a high priority. The proposed multi-disciplinary training approach is guided by a conceptual model that examines emotional, cognitive, behavioral, neurobiological and genetic aspects of psychopathology from a developmental perspective. Further, this training program is guided by a perspective that recognizes that the risk, onset and course of psychiatric disorders arises through a complex interplay of brain developmental processes influenced by psychosocial, genetic, and biological factors that interact beginning in utero and continue throughout development. The program will be guided by two researchers with complimentary expertise in developmental psychopathology (Dr. Joan Luby) and clinical neuroscience and functional imaging (Dr. Deanna Barch). Numerous investigators at Washington University (WU) have a rich track record of experience in many aspects of child neuroimaging, including an emerging new focus on fMRI in very early childhood that allows examination of the evolution of brain behavior relationships in healthy and psychopathological populations as early as the pre-school period. Further, Washington University has an international reputation in psychiatric genetics, with many investigators who can bring both behavioral and molecular genetic approaches to bear on understanding the neurobiology of developmental psychopathology. In addition, the program mentors have a rich body of databases derived from longitudinal studies, several of which began in early childhood. Research taking a developmental psychopathology approach using a neuroscience model is a new and burgeoning area in training programs. The program mentors provide a unique multidisciplinary training environment in which to pursue this exciting new domain focused on childhood, given the established collaborations between child researchers in the School of Medicine clinical and basic departments, and the state of the program in neuroscience and neuroimaging at WU that has been at the fore front of developmental cognitive and affective neuroscience. Further, interactions between researchers in basic and clinical developmental neuroscience offers an opportunity to help train the next generation of young scientists who can pursue questions about the developmental etiology of psychopathology from the perspective of core psychological and neural mechanisms of human behavior that can inform and span traditional boundaries of psychopathology, an approach central to the Research Domain Criteria Initiative (RDOC) led by the NIMH."
"9220658","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood anxiety is one of the most prevalent, common, and costly psychiatric disorders, with economic costs in the US estimated at over 40 billion USD per year. [15] As such, there is a critical need for earlier, more accurate diagnoses of pediatric anxiety disorders. Research has implicated threat bias, defined as preferential attention to threat, in the etiology of anxiety disorders. [1] However, it is unclear whether clinically-significant anxiety in young children is signaled by early (i.e., increased orienting to threat) or late (i.e., difficulty disengaging from threat) components of threat bias, or both. Determining the extent to which early or late threat bias components serve as reliable neurobehavioral markers of anxiety disorders in the early school- aged years -- a developmental period when rates of anxiety disorders begin to rise -- could reduce the public health and private burden of this illness. Specifically, this information could: (a) improve assessment protocols for differentiating between normative vs. clinical levels of anxiety, (b) elucidate altered attention control as a risk mechanism that could be directly targeted in treatment, (c) identify disruptions in a RDoC construct, response to threat systems, that are relevant for understanding the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders, and (d) determine underlying causes of maladaptive real-world responses to threat, which would in turn, (e) improve clinical efforts aimed at preventing the negative squeal of childhood-onset anxiety disorders.  Thus, the candidate's immediate focus is to investigate altered attention control as a potential neurobehavioral marker of clinically-significant anxiety in young school-aged children. Using an affective variant of a spatil cueing paradigm (Posner task), behavioral and electro cortical indices of threat bias will be assessed in a sample of anxious (N = 60) and non-anxious (N = 30) young children, aged 6-9 years. Children with specific phobia, social phobia, and separation anxiety disorders will be recruited for the anxious sample and enrollment will be monitored to ensure that at least 30 anxious children meet criteria for a moderate-to- severe impairment. Aim 1 will determine the extent to which the late component of threat bias differentiates between children with and without anxiety. To further determine the clinical significance of early and late threat bias indics for pediatric anxiety disorders, Aim 2.1 will examine relations between magnitude of early vs. late threat bias components and severity of parent-rated symptoms. Using experience sampling method (ESM) and a device called the Electronically-Activated Recorder (EAR), Aim 2.2 will determine the real-world significance of alterations in anxious children's attention responses to threat by modeling relations between indices of early and late threat bias and real-world indices of altered ER, specifically level of negative affect, sustained focus on negative events (worry, rumination), and ability to use regulatory strategies that require attention control (cognitive restructuring, distraction).  To appropriately test these Aims and to develop as an independent neurobehavioral scientist, the candidate seeks to build on her strong foundation in developmental psychopathology and early childhood emotion regulation (ER) with advanced training in: 1) developmental cognitive affective neuroscience approaches for understanding typical and atypical ER, particularly in relation to developing affective circuitry and the pathophysiology of anxiety, 2) designing, adapting, and implementing EEG/ERP methods to assess threat processing in young children, with an emphasis on paradigms and analytic methods that leverage the temporal sensitivity of EEG for identifying anxiety-related disruptions in cognitive control processes that unfold as children process and respond to emotional information, 3) ecologically-sensitive methods for assessing real- world ER behaviors in young clinical populations, and 4) statistical tools for integrating brain-behavior time series data and or modeling the temporal features of ER processes. The University Of Pittsburgh School Of Medicine is an outstanding environment in which to engage in the interdisciplinary training required to achieve these goals. The candidate's mentorship team has extensive experience in developmental cognitive affective neuroscience (Drs. Siegle, Ladouceur, Pine, and Silk), innovation of novel ecologically-sensitive methods for assessing clinically-relevant child behaviors (Drs. Silk and Slatcher), utilization of EEG/ERP methods to investigate cognitive control processes in pediatric clinical populations (Drs. Ladouceur and Fox), assessment and diagnosis of pediatric anxiety disorders (Dr. Sakolsky), and advanced statistical tools for time series data (Drs. Lanza and Siegle).  The proposed study is a first step in establishing the extent to which early vs. late threat bias components signifies clinically-significant anxiety in younger children. Findings will inform the design of larger R01 studies examining altered attention control as 1) a possible neurocognitive risk mechanism for differentiating risk among emotional disorders and anxiety subtypes, 2) a mediator of anxiety-related developmental trajectories, or 3) a target for change in the early intervention and prevention of pediatric anxiety disorders. In sum, the proposed K01 application would position the candidate for an innovative research career that integrates developmental, cognitive and affective neuroscience approaches to uncover the associations between brain and real-world behavior that underpin anxiety-related trajectories."
"9233191","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this fellowship proposal is to evaluate the role of the adaptive immune system in chronic hypoxia (CH)-induced pulmonary hypertension (PH). Our studies support a role for inflammatory cells, specifically T cells in the development of pulmonary vascular disease. CH (PB=380mmHg 3 weeks) exposure generates structural changes in pulmonary arteries, along with biochemical and functional phenotype alterations in the cells composing the arterial wall. Inflammatory cells have been shown to infiltrate vascular lesions associated with certain forms of PH, however the role for inflammatory cells in the development of PH due to CH is poorly understood. The central hypothesis to be tested is that an increase in interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the lung following CH results in TH17 T cell polarization and TH17-mediated soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) production which contributes to the development of pulmonary hypertension. The following specific aims will be pursued:  Specific Aim 1: Determine the contribution of the adaptive immune response to CH-induced PH. Hypothesis: TH17 cells contribute to CH-induced PH.  Specific Aim 2: Determine the role of TH17 cells in the development of pulmonary vascular dysfunction following CH. Hypothesis: An increase in TH17 mediated release of sIL-6R following CH induces pulmonary artery smooth muscle proliferation, migration and hypertrophy, contributing to PH.  Experiments are designed to determine the immune cell/s involved pulmonary vascular dysfunction and hypertension utilizing immune-cell deficient mice along with repletion of specific immune cell populations such as TH17 cells followed by exposure to CH or normoxia. Indices of PH will be measured such as right ventricular (RV) systolic pressure, arterial remodeling, and RV hypertrophy. Also, experiments will address whether TH17 cells secrete sIL-6R following CH, and how the secreted sIL-6R results in vascular dysfunction. This research is innovative because it is expected to elucidate novel mechanisms by which chronic exposure to hypoxia leads to pulmonary dysfunction through inflammation. This study is significant in that identifying the specific cell type involved in this response may lead to new immunotherapeutic interventions in patients with hypoxic diseases of the lung. Furthermore, elucidating the connection between cytokines and vascular smooth muscle function will deepen our understanding of the role for inflammation in various diseases characterized by pro- inflammatory states."
"9333684","Cancer immunotherapy attempts to boost the body?s own defense mechanism ? the immune system ? to kill cancer cells and defeat cancer. Immunotherapy with T cell checkpoint inhibitors is promising to revolutionize cancer therapy. However, a major limitation of these therapies is that they are effective in only a subset of patients. Recent evidence suggests that enhanced T cell infiltration in the tumor is a predictive marker of positive response to T cell checkpoint inhibitors. Thus, failure to respond to T cell checkpoint inhibitors may correspond to a defect in the ability of the innate immune system to effectively engage adaptive anti-tumor immune response. In mice, we have identified and disabled a novel immune checkpoint mechanism, a cellular protein named MERTK, that is found in innate immune cells ? the body?s first line of immune defense. MERTK limits the extent to which innate immune cells can get activated, which in turn controls how much the overall immune response would be. We have also detected the presence of MERTK in tumor-associated innate immune cells in human samples. In mouse models of cancer, genetic ablation of Mertk results in dramatic prevention of cancer growth. We propose to (i) use mouse models of cancers to investigate the mechanism/s by which loss of MERTK function improves anti-tumor immunity, (ii) test if acute ablation of Mertk in established tumors and the inactivation of its kinase activity are sufficient to overcome the failure to trigger anti- tumor T cell responses and restrict tumor growth, and (iii) to investigate the association between MERTK activation and the resistance to T cell checkpoint inhibitors in patients. Through these studies, we will better understand how the immune system can fight cancer when the MERTK brake is removed, obtain proof-of- concept for therapeutic use of drugs that would inhibit MERTK, and develop a predictive biomarker panel for the identification of a subset of patients that are likely to respond to MERTK inhibitors. In summary, our proposed studies can potentially identify a novel target for cancer immunotherapy that by itself, or in combination with FDA-approved checkpoint inhibitors or molecular targeted therapies, could significantly increase the percentage of patients that show objective response to anti-cancer therapy."
"9309215","Influenza A virus (IAV) infections have claimed over 50 million lives worldwide during epidemic and pandemics. Patients with asthma were less likely to suffer from severe influenza during the 2009 influenza pandemic compared to non-asthmatics for reasons not yet fully elucidated. We have recapitulated these clinical findings using our innovative mouse model of asthma and influenza co-morbidity, and found that heightened eosinophilia during influenza infection correlated with reduced lung viral burden. Our preliminary data showed that eosinophil transfer into lungs of virus-infected animals reduced lung viral burden and led to increased recruitment of CD8+ T-cells into the airways. Mice in the asthma and influenza co-morbidity model also have elevated gene expression of resistin-like molecule (RELM)-? and -?, and the administration of these proteins into the lungs of virus-infected mice led to a reduction in lung viral burden and increased recruitment of CD8+ T-cells. These data led to our central hypothesis that eosinophils in allergic airways promote antiviral immunity against IAV by activating CD8+ T-cells. The three overlapping aims to be investigated in this project are: (1) To identify eosinophil granule proteins released during degranulation upon direct contact with IAV and determine their impact on IAV infectivity, (2) To determine if eosinophils directly enhance CD8+ T-cell responses against IAV, and (3) To determine the function of eosinophil-derived RELM proteins in enhancing antiviral immunity against IAV. This project is significant because we propose to identify basic immune mechanisms in host defense against a prominent human pathogen with an innovative approach of investigating eosinophils as a regulator of adaptive immunity and mediator of host protection rather than as an end-stage effector cell. These studies will have a broad impact on eosinophil biology, virology, and may offer novel therapeutic targets to treat influenza."
"9414513","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research describes a mentored training program in neuroendocrine regulation of metabolism, designed to provide the candidate the necessary skills and resources that will allow him to achieve the long- term goal of developing a career as an independent neurobiologist at a research-oriented university. Department of Medicine at Mount Sinai School of Medicine has well-established programs with state-of-the-art analytical instrumentations. The primary mentor, Dr. Christoph Buettner, is an established investigator and is well respected in the field of energy metabolism, while the co-mentors are authorities in metabolomics, gut- brain communication and bariatric surgery, and metabolic syndrome. The abundant institutional resources and excellent mentorship from these experts will provide an ideal training environment for the candidate to develop independence. The research plan focuses on central insulin action and its role in the regulation of branched- chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism. Combining physiological and metabolic targeting tools with genetic, pharmacological, and surgical approaches, the experiments described in the proposal will identify: (1) the role of hypothalamic insulin on circulating BCAAs and their intermediates; () hepatic BCAA catabolism as controlled by the central insulin action; and (3) systemic and liver BCAA metabolism affected by Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery, and the potential role of central insulin action after RYGB. The proposed studies will advance our understanding of BCAA homeostasis that is under the control of hypothalamic insulin, and explain how this is perturbed in obesity and diabetes. Importantly, identifying central insulin action as a mechanism through which RYGB successfully improves BCAA metabolism holds promise for future development of non-invasive pharmacological treatments that mimic the surgery-induced effects."
"9232063","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Immune competence as a factor of treatment efficacy in Trypanosoma cruzi infection. The main drawbacks for a wider application of treatment of long-term T. cruzi infections include the difficulty of assessing treatment efficacy and the potential adverse effects of these therapeutics. Likewise, treatment regimens in terms of doses and duration in chronically T. cruzi-infected subjects are still debated. Conversely, drug therapy in T. cruzi-infected children is considered to be more effective than in adult patients. The aim of this application is to determine the association between the immunological status prior to treatment and the rate of cure following either complete treatment with benznidazole or interrupted treatment due to adverse effects. The prediction is that subjects with polyfunctional T cell responses to T. cruzi pre-therapy have higher chances to achieve cure compared with those displaying a narrower range of T cell functions. Furthermore, shortened treatment regimens are predicted to be effective in cases where immune responses are strong prior to treatment. Based on extensive preliminary data produced in the applicants' laboratories, these hypotheses will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Determine the association between the quality of T cell responses prior to drug therapy and success of treatment with benznidazole, and further validate non-conventional parameters as markers of treatment efficacy in T. cruzi-infected children; and 2) Compare treatment outcomes between complete and incomplete treatment schedules in T. cruzi-infected adults and children treated with benznidazole. Under Aim1, pretreatment immune responses specific for T. cruzi will be determined in infected children and stratified based on the capacity of T cells to exert monofunctional or polyfunctional T cell responses as determined by ELISPOT and flow cytometric assays. Then, treatment efficacy after benznidazole administration will be assessed by the achievement of complete seronegative conversion by conventional serological tests (i.e. the accepted standard of treatment success and cure in Chagas disease) and determine if treatment success is associated with a highly functional T cell profile prior to treatment compared with patients in which treatment fails. In addition, we will follow these treated subjects (irrespective of prior quality in T cell responses) with our previously reported surrogate parameters of treatment efficacy (i.e. T cell cytokine ELISPOT technique and multiplex serological assay) to determine whether patients who achieve cure show changes in immune responses post-treatment considered to reflect parasite clearance; as well as to identify the earliest changes that can be associated with cure. An observation of such association would further validate these metrics for monitoring treatment outcomes. Under the second aim, we will assess whether an incomplete course of treatment preferentially provide cure in those individuals who had more highly functional parasite specific T cell responses prior to therapy. Changes in T and B cell responses by non-conventional measures of treatment efficacy will be also compared between patients receiving full doses of benznidazole vs. those who received incomplete treatment regimens to evaluate the usefulness of these parameters to measure efficacy in cases of interrupted treatment. The proposed study is innovative in that it represents a departure from the current therapeutic approaches, namely the notion that improving host immune responses to T. cruzi could enhance treatment efficacy. These contributions will be significant because it will expand our understanding of how drug treatment works and provide guidance on how to most effectively treat and monitor therapy outcomes in chronically infected individuals."
"9317367","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Osteopontin (OPN) is involved in the pathogenesis of a wide variety of inflammatory disorders, including infections, autoimmune diseases, cancer, and other diseases accompanied with inflammation. OPN is primarily considered to be a pro-inflammatory molecule and is generally known to induce immune responses. However, recent studies suggested that OPN occasionally functions as an anti-inflammatory molecule, and how OPN switches its role is entirely elusive. It is critical to know how OPN plays the two-sided role, particularly because OPN attracts attentions as a pharmaceutical target and a disease marker in various diseases. To this end, this proposed study seeks to understand the molecular mechanism by which OPN switches immune responses, and will verify the mechanistic hypothesis with in vivo animal disease models using five lines of OPN mutant mice. Our central hypothesis is: Intracellular OPN (iOPN) is a major player to make OPN?s role switch between pro- inflammatory and anti-inflammatory. Here, OPN has two OPN isoforms, secreted (sOPN) and intracellular (iOPN). In the past, we first succeeded to biochemically confirm the presence of iOPN, and revealed the mechanism of iOPN?s generation and its functions. As a pioneer of the iOPN field, we have been continuously discovering new roles of iOPN, as well as those of sOPN. To study OPN in an isoform-specific fashion, it is important to have cells and mouse lines that exclusively express one of two isoforms. We are currently equipped not only with iOPN and sOPN expression vectors, but we will use multiple lines of OPN mutant mice, which make it possible for us to evaluate the isoform-specific role of OPN in in vivo disease models. The objective of this proposed study is to determine how iOPN functions as an anti-inflammatory molecule; and the long-term goal of this project is to elucidate the roles of iOPN and sOPN in inflammation."
"9234044","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The recent discovery of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has provided unprecedented opportunities to model human disease in vitro and better understand human development. The clinical translation of the iPSC in vitro model system is the goal of this project, whose aim is to learn about the earliest stages of human development, focused on the role in development and human disease of the earliest known marker of lung fate, the key transcriptional regulator NKX2.1. For these studies we will utilize reprogramming technology we have developed that has allowed us to establish a comprehensive bank of iPSCs generated from children with lung diseases caused by mutations in genes (such as NKX2.1) that are active from the earliest moments of lung lineage specification. These disease-specific cell lines provide naturally occurring human models of the effects of hypomorphic, mutant, or dominant negative gene expression in human beings, providing exciting opportunities to understand mechanisms that control normal vs. aberrant early lung development. Ultimately a detailed understanding of lung developmental biology should result in better treatments for patients with lung disease, exemplified by the children to be studied in this project, namely 4 individuals with divergent clinical phenotypes resulting from mutations in the coding region of NKX2.1. We will correlate our in vitro studies and models with microarrays established from the lung tissue of these children and we will test our hypothesis: the in vitro iPSC system can be applied to model and understand genetic lung diseases, exemplified by patients with divergent lung-thyroid-brain clinical phenotypes arising from reduced or augmented activity of NKX2.1. Aim 1 proposes to define the normal vs. disease-specific genetic signatures of differentiating human lung epithelial progenitors and to assess how these in vitro model systems compare to the clinical phenotypes observed in the patients from whom these cells are derived. Aim 2 evaluates the molecular mechanism, such as binding or inactivating alterations of NKX2.1 responsible for disease pathogenesis in these patients, and Aim 3 tests mechanistically-driven potential therapies for ameliorating the NKX2.1-related human disease phenotypes."
"9232228","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Specific Aims The major goal of this proposal is to understand mechanisms by which astrocytes interact with neurons to modulate neural circuit activity and animal behavior. Many studies over the past two decades have suggested that astrocytes respond directly to neurotransmission and in turn signal back to neurons to regulate circuit activity. Definitive in vivo examples have remained elusive, but if astrocytes indeed receive synaptic information and feedback to modulate neuronal activity it is imperative that we identify and define these mechanisms-astrocyte control of neuronal activity could represent a previously unappreciated but prominent mechanism for regulating information processing in the brain and animal behavior.  We recently made the exciting observation that in live preparations Drosophila astrocytes exhibit rhythmic fluctuations in intracellular Ca2+ similar to those observed in astrocytes of awake behaving mice. Astrocyte Ca2+ signaling in larvae is not altered by application of glutamate, GABA, or acetylcholine, but is potently stimulated by octopamine (OA), the invertebrate equivalent of norepinephrine (NE). Intriguingly, NE was recently found to stimulate astrocytic Ca2+ signaling in mice, although the NE site of action (e.g. neurons, astrocytes, or both) remains unclear, molecules required in astrocytes for NE-induced Ca2+ signals have not been identified, and their physiological roles remain enigmatic. Furthermore, using forward genetic approaches we identified the G protein-coupled octopamine-tyramine receptor (Oct-tyrR) and the TRP channel Waterwitch (Wtrw) as novel, astrocyte-expressed molecules required for activation of OA-induced astrocyte Ca2+ transients. Remarkably, depletion of Wtrw from astrocytes leads to defects in both olfaction and touch- induced startle responses, implicating Wtrw and astrocyte Ca2+ signaling in animal behavior. Our identification of Oct-tyrR and Wtrw as novel critical regulators of astrocyte Ca2+ signaling opens the door to an exploration of the functional significance astrocyte Ca2+ signaling in vivo, which is proposed herein. Our work will define new components of the astrocyte Ca2+ signaling machinery and their importance in astrocyte-neuron signaling events (Aim 1); determine how astrocyte Ca2+ signaling events are regulated by neural circuits and how they reciprocally modulate neuronal activity in vivo (Aim 2); and explore the role of astrocyte Ca2+ signaling molecules in simple sensory-driven behaviors, circadian and arousal behaviors, and a touch induced startle response."
"9234598","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fewer than 50% of elderly depressed patients achieve remission and functional recovery in response to first-line antidepressant pharmacotherapy. The majority of patients are left with significant residual symptoms, putting them at risk of chronic, relapsing illness, frailty, and suicide. Brain aging may be responsible fo poor treatment response. Our pilot data indicate that neurodegenerative changes with increased amyloid and tau protein binding, as well as microvascular brain changes frequently occur in older depressed individuals, as documented by using novel neuroimaging techniques (i.e., MRI and [F-18] FDDNP PET). Improved understanding of the neurobiology of brain aging in relation to treatment response can lead to the improved personalized treatment of depressed elderly with biomarkers of brain aging or with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Cognitive impairment, especially, in the domains of memory and executive functions, persists even after amelioration of depressive symptoms in older adults, and these symptoms are poorly responsive to serotonergic treatment alone. There is a compelling rationale for the study of neuroprotective glutamatergic agents, such as memantine (MEM) that can target brain aging and provide cognitive enhancement. This is also supported by our pilot data that documented enhanced antidepressant response and improvement in executive cognitive function and memory tests to a combination of escitalopram and MEM. We hypothesize that the addition of memantine to the serotonergic drug, escitalopram, may result in better mood and cognitive outcomes of late life depression that will create a more personalized treatment strategy for a subgroup of older depressed individuals with neurodegenerative and microvascular brain changes or MCI.  The current application will evaluate the predictors and moderators of treatment response to the combination of escitalopram and memantine compared to escitalopram and placebo in the 6 month randomized double- blind placebo controlled trial. We will determine whether brain structural changes, including 1. Volume and localization of white matter hyperintensities (WMH); 2.Regional gray and white matter volumes; 3. Hippocampal thickness; and 4.[F-18]FDDNP-PET total and regional binding are predictive of treatment response. We will also examine the role of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and age of depression onset in predicting treatment response. We will recruit 134 elderly non-demented subjects with major depression. Participants will be randomly assigned to two treatment groups: one group will receive combination of escitalopram and memantine, the second group will receive escitalopram and placebo. All subjects will undergo MRI and PET at baseline and comprehensive medical, neuropsychiatric, and cognitive assessments at baseline and over the course of the study, including 12 months follow up to detect depression relapse. Our study will provide unique information on the use of memantine in geriatric depression, and will investigate the underlying mechanism of treatment response, and subgroups with preferential treatment to memantine."

"9240575","?     DESCRIPTION OF THE OVERALL U19 APPLICATION (provided by applicant): Enteric infectious diseases continue to represent a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In addition to gastrointestinal pathogens that have been known for centuries, there continues to be an emergence of enteric disease agents as a product of manmade and natural changes in the environment. The appearance of antibiotic resistance and the lateral transfer of virulence factors have also impacted our ability to deal with well known pathogens. To counter these infectious disease threats, novel methods of studying these pathogens are needed. We have assembled an interdisciplinary team to address the need for novel alternative model systems for enteric diseases research. With expertise in viral and bacterial pathogenesis, immunology, tissue engineering, stem cell biology, infectious diseases and bioengineering, this team will utilize human intestinal or- ganoids (HIOs) generated from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) as a model gut epithelium. Three integrated projects will address the common specific aim of utilizing HIOs as a system to investigate the interaction between the intestinal epithelium, immune cells, microbiota and enteric pathogens. The first project will focus on the interaction of the HIO epithelium with normal members of the gut microbiota and specific enteric pathogens. Changes in the function of both the microbes and the HIO epithelium will be investigated. The second project will focus on interactions between the model epithelium found in the organoids and cellular elements of the immune system. Human immune cells will be allowed to interact with HIOs in both the presence and absence of microbes. The final project will employ a bioengineering approach to create a system that both facilitates the use of HIOs as a platform for scientific discovery and serves as a flexible platform for drug discovery and testing. These three projects will form an integrated cooperative research center that will involve investigators with a wide range of complementary expertise. Successful completion of the three projects will generate a powerful new system to study the biology of enteric disease agents and a platform for the development of novel therapeutics for their control."

"9234581","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is well established that altered sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca handling plays a key role in HF pathogenesis. Whereas altered post-translational modifications (PTM) of the SR Ca release channel/ ryanodine receptor type- 2 (RyR2) have been linked to HF development, it remains highly controversial which kinases and phosphatases underlie these disease-associated changes. RyR2 hyper-phosphorylation can be caused by increased activity of protein kinase A (PKA) and Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). However, there remains significant controversy about the mechanisms underlying altered phosphorylation of RyR2 in HF. We have identified a novel kinase within the RyR2 macromolecular complex, known as `striated muscle preferentially expressed gene' (SPEG). Our preliminary data show that SPEG phosphorylates a novel phosphorylation site on RyR2, S2811. In addition, our data suggest that SPEG levels are downregulated in patients and mice with congestive heart failure. Our long-term goal is to define the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which SEPG regulates RyR2 and intracellular Ca handling in normal and failing hearts. The overall hypothesis is that SPEG phosphorylates a novel S2811 residue on RyR2, which modulates RyR2 activity and intracellular Ca handling in cardiac myocytes. Specific aim (1) will determine how SPEG binds to RyR2 and how SPEG modifies intracellular Ca handling. Specific aim (2) will assess the role of SPEG modulation of RyR2 in heart failure. Specific aim (3) will determine the role of SPEG-mediated phosphorylation of S2811 on RyR2 in normal and failing hearts. Significance: Heart failure (HF) is a deadly and costly disease affecting 5.7 millin people in the US alone, and a leading cause of hospitalization for those >65 years of age. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying abnormal RyR2 function in HF could lead to new pharmacological strategies."
"9228405","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): 18% of 18-25 year-olds seek help for psychological distress (e.g., depressive/anxiety symptoms, failing to cope with everyday stressors and interpersonal relationships). Yet unfortunately, there are few or no previous psychiatric history, and no biological, measures to predict future functional outcome and guide treatment choice for these vulnerable individuals. Two dimensions of behaviors and experiences that are common in these individuals, with potentially deleterious consequences for psychosocial function, are: impulsive sensation seeking, the tendency and willingness to seek, and take risks for, novel and intense sensations and experiences; and anhedonia, the inability to experience pleasure. The Research Domain Criteria is a dimensional approach to psychiatric illness that includes neural circuitry and self-report (SR) measures of behaviors related to dimensional constructs in core domains that are agnostic to DSM diagnoses. We have identified in non-help seeking (unaffected) and help-seeking (affected) adults significant relationships among neuroimaging measures of reward neural circuitry function and SR measures of the above two behaviors, that are in turn related to two positive valence systems domain constructs: reward expectancy and sustained responsiveness to reward attainment. We will recruit 150 affected 18-25 year-olds seeking help for psychological distress, irrespective of DSM diagnosis (>1 visit to student counseling/ emergency room psychiatrist/ Pittsburgh Youth and Family Training Institute (YFTI); referred to primary care/psychiatric services, continuing counseling/YFTI; unmedicated or SRI antidepressant/stimulants <2 weeks); and 125 age-, gender-, ethnicity-, SES- and IQ-matched unaffected individuals. We hypothesize: 1. Reward expectancy: greater reward circuitry activity and functional connectivity (FC) (in ventral striatum (VS), lateral orbitofrontal cortex) to monetay reward expectancy will be associated with higher scores on standardized measures of impulsive sensation seeking. Sustained responsiveness to reward attainment: greater medial prefrontal cortical activity and medial prefrontal cortical-VS FC to happy faces/monetary reward receipt will be associated with higher scores on standardized measures of anhedonia. Neuroimaging-SR relationships may differ between affected and unaffected individuals. 2. We will identify underlying factors among these neuroimaging and SR measures in all individuals, and separately in affected and unaffected individuals. 3. In affected individuals, the magnitude of many of these measures and factor scores will be significant predictors of poor outcome: no. days' hospitalization/intensive outpatient care; worsening psychological distress, affective/anxiety/ADHD symptoms, psychosocial function, quality of life; developing suicide ideation/attempt, psychosis, substance abuse/dependence. The proposed study aims to identify measures reflecting dimensions of pathophysiology in 18-25 year-olds seeking help for psychological distress, to ultimately provide neurobiological targets to guide personalized treatment, and optimize functional outcome for these vulnerable young people."

"9443841","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 1 in 7 men in the U.S. will be diagnosed with prostate cancer at some point in his lifetime. The five-year survival rate for metastatic prostate cancer is a mere 30%. Bone metastasis is incurable and deadly. Osteoblasts are bone cells that secrete a protein called stromal cell-derived factor (SDF-1). SDF-1 recruits prostate circulating tumor cells (CTCs) to the bone, where they become disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) and interact directly with osteoblasts in the endosteal niche. DTCs often remain dormant, or slowly proliferating, once they enter the endosteal niche. As a result of this dormancy, DTCs are difficult to kill with chemotherapy because they target rapidly proliferating cells. One strategy to overcome this chemoresistance is to mobilize the DTCs from the bone and into circulation where they theoretically begin proliferating and would therefore become chemosensitive. Mobilization is possible by inhibiting the receptor for SDF-1 called C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4). A second strategy to kill DTCs is to use CXCR4 to bring cytotoxic drugs directly to the DTCs by using a CXCR4-antibody-drug conjugate (CXCR4-ADC). It is also essential to learn more about the biology of prostate CTCs so as to better understand them; one strategy to address this is by injecting these cells directly into mice and studying thei migratory patterns, kinetics, and responses to drugs. Our overarching hypothesis is that the CXCR4 receptor can be exploited via small molecule inhibition for combination mobilization therapy and via direct binding for targeted therapy for metastatic prostate cancer. To address this hypothesis, we will perform the following three aims. Aim 1: Determine the proliferative state and chemotherapeutic sensitivity of mobilized prostate CTCs and DTCs. Aim 2: Determine the sensitivity of prostate CTCs and DTCs to a potent CXCR4-antibody-drug conjugate. Aim 3: Determine the viability of mobilized CTCs in in vitro and mouse models. If this work is successful, we would be able to move these laboratory discoveries into the clinic for therapeutic intervention for men with metastatic prostate cancer."
"9228391","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adult suicide rates in the United States rose by almost 30 percent between 1999 and 2010. These rates have not markedly improved in decades. To date, previous suicide attempts and psychiatric diagnoses are largely the only known clinical risk factors for suicide death. Recent research shows that most individuals who die by suicide make a health care visit in the weeks and months prior to their death. Most of these visits occur in primary care or outpatient medical specialty settings. However, over half of these visits do not include a psychiatric diagnosis. Thus, there is limited evidence available from health care users in the US general population to inform targeted suicide screening and risk identification efforts in general medical settings. New research is needed to investigate the general medical clinical factors associated with suicide risk among individuals without a known risk factor. This research project uses data on more than 4000 individuals who died by suicide and made health care visits to one of eight health care systems across the United States in the year prior to their death. These health systems are members of the Mental Health Research Network and have affiliated health plans. They are able to capture nearly all health care for their patients via the Virtual Data Warehouse (VDW). The VDW consists of electronic medical record and insurance claims data organized using standardized data structures and definitions across sites. These data are matched with official regional mortality data. This project includes the following Specific Aims: 1) Identify the types and timing of clinical factors prior to suicide, 2a) Compare clinical factors before suicide to a matched sample of health care users, 2b) Detect associations between additional clinical factors and suicide, 3) Develop a prediction model of clinical factors prior to suicide, and 4) investigate indicators of hidden mental health need in general medical chart notes prior to suicide. We employ a case-control study approach to test specific hypotheses, while also using novel environment-wide association study methods and latent class analysis to detect new risk factors. We develop a prediction model of clinical factors and suicide. We use qualitative analyses to review clinical text notes and develop a natural language processing algorithm to identify risk. Clinical factors to be studied include medical diagnoses, medications, health care procedures, and types of health care visits. These results will inform decisions about how to focus suicide prevention in medical settings and provide information in response to the 2012 National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention and US Surgeon General report."
"9333801","As macrophages within the tumor microenvironment can exhibit anti-tumor or pro-tumor effects, modulation of their behavior represents a potential therapeutic approach. This is particularly relevant in the context of ovarian cancer progression where macrophages are a major immune cell population. While the roles of NF-?B signaling in the regulation of tumor-associated macrophages are poorly understood, we have reported that increased NF-?B specifically within macrophages using doxycycline-inducible transgenic mouse models results in significant tumor cell cytotoxicity in the context of mammary or melanoma tumor cells in vivo. We have evidence demonstrating that these effects result from both direct cytotoxic ability and effects on other immune cells. We have begun to gain insights into the roles of NF-?B in ovarian cancer using in vivo models of progression that recapitulate the human disease with significant peritoneal tumor implants and ascites formation. Our findings lead us to believe that direct targeted activation of canonical NF-?B activity in macrophages during defined stages of ovarian tumor progression will induce cytotoxic effects, improve immune responses, and thus decrease tumor load and ascites accumulation. We will use our unique, inducible transgenics to demonstrate the therapeutic potential of increasing macrophage NF-?B activity during ovarian cancer progression. These findings will be used to instruct the optimization and testing of treatments comprised of either liposomally encapsulated MTP-PE (a drug in clinical use for other indications), or of I?B? siRNA delivered specifically to tumor-associated macrophages by nanoparticles. Both of these strategies will increase NF-?B signaling in macrophages and limit disease progression. Our studies will test the hypothesis that increased NF-?B signaling within macrophages in the tumor microenvironment limits tumor progression and synergizes with clinically relevant chemotherapy and thus, represents a novel therapeutic approach.  These studies will define the impact of increasing NF-?B signaling specifically in macrophages on the tumor microenvironment and ovarian tumor progression and will show that targeted modulation of NF-?B in macrophages can be harnessed as a novel therapy. These pre-clinical studies will provide critical evidence for a novel immunomodulatory approach alone or combined with relevant chemotherapy for improving ovarian cancer treatment."
"9291096","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This Academic-Industry partnership aims to develop and translate new instrumentation and techniques for HP 13C-urea MR perfusion imaging alone and in combination with HP 13C-pyruvate to enable future clinical studies of patients with cancer, facilitating a more personalized approach to therapeutic selection and monitoring. The end product of this project will be new dDNP Spinlab polarizer hardware and methods capable of producing sterile, hyperpolarized compounds for first-in-man perfusion and combined perfusion and metabolic imaging through initial prostate cancer patient investigations. To accomplish this important project, we have assembled an exceptional academic and industrial team with expertise in pre-clinical and clinical cancer research, HP sterile compounding, HP MRI development, and industry product development to: Develop chemistry, agent hardware and methods of dissolution DNP for the production of sterile HP 13C-urea by itself and then in combination with sterile HP 13C-pyruvate (Aim 1). Develop and implement novel rapid volumetric 13C MR imaging methods for serial dynamic imaging of HP 13C-urea, 13C-pyruvate and its metabolites, with high temporal and spatial resolution (Aim 2). Preclinical Testing and SOP development required for FDA IND submission (Aim 3). Establish safety and imaging feasibility of first-in-man combined HP 13C-urea and 13C- pyruvate MR imaging studies in patients with prostate cancer (Aim 4). The clinical motivation for this academic-industry partnership is that prostate cancer management is severely limited by currently available clinical and imaging information required to select the most appropriate treatment for individual patients and to assess response to therapy or development of therapeutic resistance. Hyperpolarized (HP) 13C MRI is a paradigm shifting new MR molecular imaging technique that provides new measures to detect, characterize aggressiveness, and monitor therapy in order to improve cancer clinical trials and individualized patient care. The scientific premise for this project is that, with the success of phase 1 clinical trial of HP 13C-pyruvate imaging in prostate cancer patients, the proliferation of commercially available clinical polarizers, and the strong pre-clinical data demonstrating the potential value of HP 13C urea & pyruvate for advancing cancer imaging, the time is right for translating this new technology into the clinic and integrating it into current state-of-the-art imaging approaches. This Academic-Industry partnership is critical for robustly translating this novel imaging technology into the clinical arena, and UCSF and General Electric (GE) are uniquely positioned to accomplish this goal together. Although the novel hyperpolarized imaging tools and methods developed and disseminated in this academic- industrial partnership will initially be applied to patients with prostate cancer, they will have general applicability for a wide variety of cancers, and other human diseases."
"9384234","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The main goal of this research proposal is to identify the functional contribution of cellular oxygen sensing mechanisms through prolylhydroxylases (PHD1-3)1 to renal protection from acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality and novel treatment options are urgently needed2. Renal ischemia is a very common cause of AKI3. Therefore, we established a murine model of renal ischemia to induce AKI4-7. This model allows us to examine pharmacologic or genetic approaches to identify novel treatment forms for AKI.During renal ischemia, shifts in the metabolic supply and demand ratio - particularly for oxygen - result in severe tissue hypoxia. Cellular responses to hypoxia are regulated by enzymes that sense cellular oxygen levels and coordinate transcriptional responses to hypoxia or ischemia. Central among these enzymes are three oxygen sensing prolyl hydroxylases (PHD1-3). Limited oxygen availability results in inhibition of PHDs with subsequent stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). Activation of HIFs drives a transcriptional response that steers cellular metabolism towards hypoxia adaptation and survival. Thus, we hypothesized that genetic deletion or pharmacologic inhibition of PHDs mediates kidney protection from ischemia. To pursue this hypothesis, we exposed gene-targeted mice for Phd1, Phd2 or Phd3 to AKI and assessed renal function by measuring GFR or histology. Surprisingly, we found a selective phenotype in Phd1-/- mice with remarkable protection from ischemic AKI. To gain mechanistic insight into how Phd1 deletion protects the kidneys from ischemia, we performed microarray studies. The most profound difference in gene expression was an over 10 fold repression of Atp4a, when comparing ischemic kidneys from Phd1-/- mice with controls. Subsequent studies with pharmacologic ATP4A inhibitors mimicked the kidney protection from ischemia seen in Phd1-/- mice, and highlight a novel function for ATP4A inhibitors in conserving renal energy levels during ischemic AKI. Therefore, we will define the contribution of PHD1 expressed in renal epithelia to kidney protection from AKI, utilizing mice with tisue specific Phd1 deletion (Aim1). We will go on to dissect the role of HIFs in PHD- mediated ATP4A repression during ischemia (Aim 2), and finally study functional consequences of Atp4a deletion/inhibition in kidney protection from AKI (Aim 3). We believe these studies are highly significant for the treatment of patients suffering from ischemic AKI. PHD inhibitors and inhibitors for proton pumps (e.g. esomeprazole) are used clinically for the treatment of acid reflux. They efficiently inhibit renal ATP4A and have a great safety profile. If successful, our findings could be readily translated into the clinical treatment of AKI."
"9225199","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the widespread appreciation that the prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices (PFC/PPC) are necessary for flexible action and efficient perception, there is a fundamental gap in understanding the control mechanisms by which they accomplish these goals. This gap in knowledge is a critical problem because a host of psychiatric and neurologic disorders stem from a primary dysfunction of executive control. The long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms by which the PFC and PPC exert control over motor and sensory systems. The objective of the current proposal is to test a new model of how activity in the PFC and PPC form maps of prioritized space that tag salient and relevant locations in the visual field, which can then be used as the basis of executive control signals. The mechanisms of bias are likely to involve mechanisms used for saccade planning. The central aim of the project is to test the extent to which the patterns of neural activity in the human PFC and PPC are consistent with predictions from the priority map theory, including the functional organization of priority maps, the nature of what is prioritized, and the representation of competing priorities. The rationale for the proposed research is that a better understanding of how control is exerted will lead to a strong theoretical framework within which strategies for the understanding of mental disease will develop. The objective will be to test, refine, and possibly refute, tenets of the priority map theory which will be accomplished by pursuing three specific aims: 1) test the hypothesis that the activity in priority maps is agnostic about what led to prioritization; 2) test the hypothesis that the activity in priority maps encodes the incentives associated with multiple prioritized items; and 3) test the hypothesis that the activity in priorit maps encodes the cue probabilities associated with multiple prioritized items. Strong preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility of aims in the applicant's hands. Several candidate priority maps were identified in frontoparietal cortex using novel topographical mapping approaches. Under Aim 1, both delay period activity and multivariate patterns of brain activity in candidate priority maps were remarkably similar, if not interchangeable, across a variety of spatial cognition tasks (e.g., memory, attention, planning). Under Aim 2, behavioral measures and spatially specific activity in frontal and parietal cortex scaled with the incentive driven priorites of locations maintained in working memory. Under aim 3, working memory performance scaled with the likelihood that maintained locations would be later probed. The approach is innovative because it is highly programmatic; uses novel approaches to combat individual differences in the functional neuroanatomy of the PFC and PPC; sidesteps past inferential weaknesses with novel analyses; and uses powerful methods to rigorously test key hypotheses. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to test an important new model of executive control and will provide a detailed understanding of the mechanisms by which the human brain exerts control, such that models of dysfunction of these mechanisms can be targeted as causes of and potential treatments for neuropathology."
"9410465","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This work is directed at the development of a microelectrode array for electrocorticography (ECoG) that allows the recording and stimulation of neural activity on the surface of the brain over a large area at high spatial resolution. Existig technologies either allow the recording of neural activity (i) over a large brain area at low spatil resolution (standard commercial ECoGs), or (ii) over a small brain area at high spatial resolution (so called µECoGs). BMSEED aims to produce large-area-high-resolution µECoG electrode arrays (lahrµECoGs). Conventional ECoG electrode arrays are placed on the surface of the brain, and are used as a less invasive alternative to penetrating microelectrodes, which are inserted into the brain tissue. They are used (i) in neuroscience research to explore the fundamentals of how the brain operates, (ii) in brain-machine-interfaces (BMIs) to record neural activity to drive a neuroprosthesis for amputees or to move a computer cursor for the paralyzed, and (iii) for monitoring neural activity during epilepsy surgery to identify the regions of the corex that generate seizures, which subsequently are removed. These applications would benefit from BMSEED's lahrµECoG because it would provide more accurate localization of the recorded signals (i.e., normal neural activity as well as seizures) over a large area, thus improving brain research, making BMIs more robust, and improving clinical outcomes in epilepsy surgery by providing the neurosurgeon with more accurate localization of seizure activity. In all ECOGs, each recording electrode requires one wire to electrically connect to the data acquisition system without intersecting (i.e., without shorting) with other wires. This becomes increasingly difficult  as the density and total number of electrodes increases. BMSEED's lahrµECoG solves this problem by routing the lead wires on multiple levels. In addition, our proprietary technology to produce mechanically robust microelectrodes using microfabrication techniques allows us to reduce the thickness, thus the stiffness, of the device, making the implant more compliant. Importantly, BMSEED's lahrµECoG consists entirely of materials that are suitable for implantation in humans, thus simplifying the FDA approval process. The first specific aim is to optimize the profile of the slope between different levels to provide a reliable electrical connection, and to fabricate and electromechanically characterize prototypes of the lahrµECoG. The second aim is to demonstrate the biocompatibility and capabilities of the prototypes. To that end, a lahrµECoG will be chronically implanted in five cats, and neural recording and micro-stimulation data will be obtained for at least two months. At the end of phase I, BMSEED will have (i) developed the capability to produce multi-level metallization and prototypes of lahrµECoGs, and (ii) characterized their capabilities in a cat model. In phase II, BMSEED will extend the lahrµECoGs development to multi-level metallization on larger, clinically relevant substrate sizes. Our customers will initially be research laboratories, and, after FDA approval, biomedical companies for BMI applications and hospitals for clinical applications."
"9231377","The filoviruses and arenaviruses are NIAID/CDC Category A biodefense pathogens that cause severe and rapidly progressing hemorrhagic fever. There are currently no FDA-approved, specific therapeutics against any of these viruses. Investigators in this consortium have recently demonstrated that monoclonal antibodies can provide effective post-exposure protection against these viruses in two or more animal models. Provision of monoclonal antibody immunotherapeutics provides the most economically viable and scientifically proven avenue for pre- or post-exposure therapy. In the armamentarium of this consortium are hundreds of mAbs against these viruses, representing the largest array of antibodies against these viruses yet compiled and including the most effective antibodies known against these viruses. However, we do not what the epitopes of most of these antibodies are, how they function to ameliorate viral infection, or if the currently chosen cocktails are even synergistic. Further, it is largely unknown what sites of the viral glycoproteins are the best targets for antibody intervention. In order to develop these antibodies or cocktails of antibodies for clinical use, we must understand where each antibody binds, which bind to the same or different sites, and which are synergistic and why. This Core (Core D, Mechanistic Structural Biology) will answer these critical knowledge gaps. In this Gore, we are using innovative, state-of-the-art, high-throughput approaches that will allow structural mapping of -100 antibody binding sites per year by single particle electron microscopy. Using these approaches, we will be able to map the epitopes of nearly every anti-filovirus and antiarenavirus antibody known. We will complement these EM approaches by higher-resolution X-ray crystallographic analysis of a smaller set of antibodies of very high interest, chosen for their unique functional capacity and highest efficacy. This information will be used to sort antibodies into groups based on binding site and function. By sorting antibodies into binding site groups, and by integrating essential functional information from the complementary Mechanistic Virology Gore (Core C), we will be able to sort and rank antibodies of each type. We will be able to select the most effective antibodies that bind to each site and determine which combinations among them are most effective. The innovative and state-of-the-art structural studies in this Core will provide information critical to selection and development of the necessary cocktails of antibodies against these emerging and re-emerging public health threats."
"9226058","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bioinformatics and genomics are transforming medicine and basic research at a rapid pace, challenging K-12 students and teachers to keep up. There have been several calls to introduce these concepts earlier in the curriculum. However, it is not just modern science that is failing to reach our students. Our students are not succeeding in basic science, particularly students who are traditionally underrepresented in scientific fields. Teachers who do not have comprehensive or up-to-date scientific background contribute to this problem, as does a steep decline in student science interest during middle school. The result is a scientific workforce that does not mirror U.S. diversity and a population that does not appreciate the importance, relevance, or excitement of science. This project reinforces basic science concepts, sparks interest and prepares students for personal, academic and professional encounters with bioinformatics and genomics (e.g. tumor profiling, personalized medicine and/or science careers). The project provides a partnership model involving teachers, scientists and pedagogy experts to develop bioinformatics-enhanced instructional units.            Teachers will work collaboratively with scientists and pedagogy experts to design bioinformatics-based units, and then implement the units in their classrooms. As the project matures, the teachers and project team will tailor the bioinformatics-based units to the local community, focusing on cultural and local relevancy. A mixed methods approach will be used to analyze and evaluate outcomes. Teacher and student learning will be analyzed quantitatively, and qualitative methods will be used to assess the impact on teacher and student interest and engagement.            Specific Aims      1. Provide teacher professional development through intensive, collaborative workshops.      2. Field test and evaluate the innovative bioinformatics-enhanced activities in classrooms with a high proportion of URM students.     3. Disseminate tools and inform scientific, science education, and outreach communities about the impact of this approach.          This will contribute to diversifying the STEM pipeline and achieving a scientifically literate populace by producing engaging instructional materials that increase science achievement in a population with high representation of Hispanics."
"9259364","Project Summary The incorporation of fluorine into molecules has been widely demonstrated to alter the physical properties as well as bioactivity of chemical compounds. While a variety of practical catalytic fluorination methods have been established for late-stage 19F chemistry there are relatively few practical methods for 18F that enable access to a broad scope of substrates. Conventional methods for accessing C-F bonds in radiochemistry are highly specialized for aliphatic compounds and utilize organometallic reagents or stoichiometric oxidants for aryl compounds. Ideally, a fluorination strategy would occur at room temperature and rely on abundant and stable organic substrates such as benzoic acids and inexpensive fluoride salts. Although cross- coupling methods are capable of promoting this type of reaction in the presence of a transition metal catalyst, a long-standing challenge, especially in aryl fluorination, is the effective reductive elimination of carbon-fluorine bonds from a low-valent transition metal complex. In this research strategy, we propose accessing a reactive, high-valent metal fluoride species with a photocatalyst, while still relying on convenient aryl starting materials. In addition to acting as an oxidant for the transition metal, we propose that the photocatalyst in its reduced state can activate an aryl ester for capture by the main transition metal catalyst. This ester can be easily made in situ or pre-synthesized from the corresponding carboxylic acid, making the procedure amenable to a radiochemist. The unification of a photoredox catalyst with a transition metal catalyst has precedent, however, has not yet been applied to fluorination chemistry. This dual catalytic system is predicted to enable the fluorination of Lewis basic and protic molecules under mild conditions. And, if successful, this reaction would provide the first example of light-driven synthesis of radiopharmaceuticals. Due to the prevalence of fluorine in bioactive molecules, the success of this chemistry with even 19F would represent a valuable advance in the field. Specific aim 1 discusses the design and optimization of the light promoted fluorination of activated aryl esters. Specific aim 2 presents the fluorination of activated aliphatic esters. And, specific aim 3 discusses the application of this methodlogy to the development of radiopharmaceuticals."
"9442931","Project Summary  Growing up in a stressful family environment - marked by conflict, insensitive parenting, chaos, dysfunction and a lack of warmth - increases risk for medical problems across the lifespan. The strongest evidence for these risks is in the realm of cardiovascular disease (CVD), although early-life family stress also heightens vulnerability to other chronic illnesses, including diabetes and cancer. Collectively, these chronic conditions affect half of the adult population in the US, and as such constitute a major public health burden. Presently there is limited mechanistic understanding of how these risks arise, but insights about underlying pathways could facilitate risk stratification and preventive efforts. In that regard, adolescence is a particularly important period to consider, given that the adolescent years are marked by significant changes in psychosocial and biobehavioral processes important to health. Adolescence is also when preclinical signs of chronic diseases emerge. However, there is a paucity of research focusing on how the family context during adolescence confers early disease risk, especially within prospective designs. As such, we know little about underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, whether these processes occur similarly across ethnic groups is unknown, despite evidence of significant cultural differences in health risks, family values, and psychosocial processes.  To address these issues, the proposed research of this application aims to: 1) examine the prospective relations between adolescent family experiences and a multi-layer inflammatory phenotype and metabolic endpoints during adolescence and adulthood; 2) determine whether these associations are mediated by poor social relationships, greater threat vigilance, unhealthy eating, and physical inactivity; and 3) investigate the potential moderating role of ethnicity in these processes. These questions will be addressed using two separate longitudinal studies of adolescence. This program of research will advance our understanding of how the adolescent family context mechanistically impacts health across ethnic groups, which can inform the development of culturally tailored prevention and intervention efforts aimed at reducing risk for adverse health outcomes. In addition to addressing a public health concern, execution of the proposed studies will foster the applicant's development as a researcher investigating the interplay between the family and cultural contexts and psychosocial and behavioral processes during adolescence and their contributions to early disease risk. More specifically, it will support the applicant's training goals of deepening her understanding of how early stress confers early risk for poor long-term health via the immune system, acquiring laboratory skills for measuring basic immunologic processes, developing and applying quantitative skills in longitudinal and path analysis of epidemiological data, and establishing a publication record in these areas."
"9316784","PROJECT SUMMARY The development of broadly cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) in HIV-1 infected individuals requires iterative rounds of envelope (Env)-mediated B cell receptor stimulation, strain specific (autologous) neutralizing antibody (NAb) elicitation, and associated virus escape. In this virus/antibody ?arms race?, particular Env escape mutants are generated which, among the myriads of other Env variants present in infected individuals, are able to select for antibody lineages that acquire neutralization breadth. Although the principle of virus/antibody co-evolution has been established, the number, identity, succession, and cooperation of the particular Env variants that initiate and sustain bNAb lineage maturation have not been determined. It is also unclear to what extent the pathways of bNAb induction observed in one individual can be generalized to others. To address these questions, this HIVRAD team will test the scientific premise that simian-human immunodeficiency viruses (SHIVs) bearing HIV-1 Envs that engage V1V2 and V3-glycan bNAb unmutated common ancestor (UCA) and intermediate ancestor (IA) B cell receptors (BCR) in humans will bind related BCRs in rhesus macaques, leading to a recapitulation of virus/antibody coevolution and the development of NAb breadth and potency. We have already overcome a critical hurdle toward these objectives by generating primary and transmitted founder (TF) Env containing SHIVs, which replicate to high titers in rhesus macaques and yield patterns of early env evolution and autologous NAb escape that are astonishingly similar to those of humans infected with HIV-1 strains encoding the same Envs. These data suggest that B cell responses to a common Env antigen may, at least for some Envs, be deterministic and that by comparing the patterns of virus/antibody coevolution in outbred macaques and humans infected with the same Env expressing virus, it will be possible to identify common pathways of virus/BCR engagement and bNAb development that can be applied to vaccine design. The Virus and Antibody Gene Sequencing Core (Core B) will support this project by providing state-of-the-art sequencing services that will allow this HIVRAD consortium to dissect the mechanisms of SHIV elicited protective humoral immunity. Working closely with the Bioinformatics and Statistics Core (Core C) as well as Projects #1, #2 and #3, we will (i) characterize the evolving env quasispecies in SHIV infected macaques over time, and (ii) use Sanger and nextgen sequencing (NGS) methods to sequence antibody heavy (VHDJH) and light (VLJL) chain variable regions from clonal B cell cultures and rhesus memory B cells before and after SHIV infection and/or immunization. The goal is to understand the dynamic interactions between the evolving Env quasispecies and members of NAb and bNAb lineages to identify key Env escape mutations that reproducibly initiate and drive bNAb maturation."
"9241245","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Suture materials and surgical knot tying techniques have improved dramatically since their first use over five millennia ago. However, the approach remains limited by the ability of the suture to transfer load to tissue at suture anchor points. Ths is especially problematic for repairs that require high strength such as tendon and ligament repairs, where repair-site elongation and rupture rates are as high as 94% for rotator cuff and 48% for flexor tendon. The goal of this proposal is to revolutionize suture repair technology by creating adhesive-coated sutures that distribute load transfer over the suture's length, leading to substantial improvements in surgical repair strength. Using mathematical models that define desirable adhesive material properties for improving tendon repair strength, the first aim of the study seeks to develop adhesive biomaterials with optimized mechanical properties to improve load distribution of tendon repairs. These novel bioadhesive materials will be created using a suite of tools to control both mechanical and chemical properties. Adhesive biomaterials will be applied to sutures and evaluated biomechanically in ex vivo flexor digitorum profundus tendons. The second aim will evaluate biocompatibility of adhesive biomaterials that provide at least a 30% improvement in ex vivo repair strength. Biocompatibility will be assessed via cell- and tissue-level responses to the bioadhesives after co- culturing primary tendon fibroblasts with the adhesive biomaterials in vitro, as well as implanting the adhesive biomaterials subcutaneously in an in vivo animal model. After establishing the ex vivo mechanical efficacy and in vivo biocompatibility, the third aim will determine efficacy of adhesive sutures for improved outcomes after in vivo tendon repairs in a preclinical surgical study. Fully trained orthopedic surgeons wil apply this new technology in a clinically relevant, established large animal model for flexor tendon repair to assess surgical outcomes. This research will develop a novel suturing platform that fundamentally changes the mechanical principles of suture repairs, transforming this age-old technology to dramatically improve surgical repair strength. The proposed research will demonstrate the clinical utility of adhesive-coated sutures through preclinical studies that lay th foundation for clinical trials. This research has the potential to improve repair strength, enable more aggressive rehabilitation protocols, and decrease surgical repair failures for tendon and ligament reconstruction."
"9213401","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rural Appalachia is a medically underserved area whose residents experience significant healthcare disparities. Because of the insular nature of rural Appalachian communities, change from within is particularly important. Thus, attracting residents from these areas to the biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research workforce may be essential for reducing the critical health disparities in the region. However, the low income, high unemployment, and substandard health care that epitomize rural Appalachia evolve in part from a fundamentally devalued educational system. Studies show that students in these reduced-income rural schools have lower educational aspirations and are less likely to consider college as a viable option due to the contextual barriers they face, including limited economic resources, few role models with postsecondary education, a lack of active parental support, and a fear of 'fitting in' to the college lifestyle. However, studies also indicate that these same students possess a fiercely independent nature that would serve as a critical asset for achieving success in higher learning pursuits, and that strong cultural links would promote 'giving back' to their community's needs. Thus, rural Appalachian students possess the skills and capacities to succeed in a postsecondary educational environment if they could effectively confront and eliminate the perceived barriers preventing them from doing so. Our long range goal in this effort is to develop efficacious interventions that both reduce these contextual barriers (via mentoring and support) and increase interest in (via direct exposure to research and career options) pipeline science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medical science (STEMM) majors among Appalachian youth. Our objective is to determine the extent to which such a multifaceted intervention strategy leads to increased intentions to pursue an undergraduate STEMM degree. Our hypothesis is that students who experience such interventions will show increases in important intrapersonal social-cognitive factors and in their intentions to pursue a postsecondary degree than students not exposed to such interventions. Our specific aims are to 1) understand the role of barriers to and support for higher education in Appalachian high school students' interest in pursuing STEMM-related undergraduate degrees, and 2) to develop sustainable interventions that decrease barriers to and increase support for higher education and that increase STEMM-related self- efficacy and interest. Achieving these aims will provide concrete tools for schools across rural Appalachia to use to increase the number of their students equipped with the skillsets required to join our State's high-growth biomedical and clinical research industry workforce."
"9237261","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 1.3 billion people worldwide use tobacco products. Tobacco products are tightly regulated in most developed countries, and with these regulations, use has decreased. However, tobacco consumption is increasing globally due to increased consumption in developing nations. E-cigarettes are battery-powered nicotine delivery systems advertised as healthier than cigarettes that are gaining in popularity globally. By 2014, more than 466 brands existed with more than 7764 uniquely flavored nicotine solutions (e-liquids). While some countries have imposed restrictions sales of e-cigarettes, these devices are mostly unregulated. While the harmful effects of cigarette smoking in the orofacial region are recognized, little is known about the effects of aerosolized e-liquids. The goal of this applicatio is to unravel the effects of e-cigarette aerosol mixtures using a multi-system approach with robust in vitro and in vivo models to identify the most susceptible cell types and tissues, as well as the effects of these aerosol mixtures in the development, healing, and regeneration of craniofacial structures. Using cells from orofacial tissues as in vitro model, we will conduct biological, biochemical, and molecular interrogations to characterize the cytotoxic, proliferative, apoptotic, and inflammatory effects of aerosol mixtures. Additionally, we will use our novel Xenopus laevis model to elucidate the effects of e-cigarette aerosols in craniofacial development. These development studies will be complemented by our chronic exposure model, in which mice will be exposed to e-cigarette aerosols during pregnancy and the effects on their offspring's orofacial development studied. Our comprehensive approach will also investigate the effects of e-cigarette aerosols in our models of wound healing and regeneration, including common craniofacial surgical procedures like tooth extractions and dental implants, as well as more recent methods like bone tissue engineering. This approach will result in a detailed understanding of the effects of e- cigarette aerosol mixtures on the homeostasis, development, wound healing, and regeneration of craniofacial tissues."
"9313133","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A growing body of evidence suggests that pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling cooperates with Ras pathway hyperactivation to drive tumor development. Thus, targeted anti-cytokine therapy might serve a useful adjunct to conventional therapeutic approaches. Plexiform neurofibroma (PNF) is a benign tumor of the nerve that arises from the Schwann cell lineage after biallelic loss of Nf1, a negative regulator of Ras. PNF causes significant early and lifelong morbidity in persons with the common genetic disorder, Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Prior work by our group and others has shown both that leukocyte recruitment is critical for plexiform neurofibroma development in mice, and that injury-associated nerve inflammation can facilitate PNF development in mice. Here we identify a cytokine overexpressed in the peripheral nerves of our PNF mouse model, whose receptor is necessary for the development of PNF. The Cxcr3 cytokine signaling pathway has known roles in the recruitment of leukocytes, and is reported to directly contribute to tumor cell growth and cancer. Our general hypothesis is that signaling through this cytokine pathway contributes to plexiform neurofibroma development through direct effects on the Nf1-null Schwann cell lineage, and/or indirectly through leukocyte recruitment. Deletion of Cxcr3 rescues Schwann cell hyperplasia, and alters leukocyte recruitment in our mouse model. We propose to further elucidate the role of this pathway in PNF development by carrying out the following specific aims: (1) determine the effects of receptor inhibition on established plexiform neurofibroma; (2) identify the relative contributions of receptor expression on hematopoietic and non- hematopoietic cells on PNF development; (3) determine if genetic deletion of the over-expressed Cxcr3 ligand recapitulates receptor deletion. Drugs antagonizing the effects of this pathway are currently in phase II trials for several inflammatory diseases. This experiments outlined represent a critical first step in investigating the therapeutic potential of anti-cytokin treatments in plexiform neurofibroma."
"9333033","Recent evidence has provided an understanding of the molecular mechanisms and genetic changes underlying pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) pathogenesis; however, limited information is available on progression in the disease. Studies in several genetically engineered mouse models for PDAC suggest that acinar cells, centroacinar cells, and/or postulated stem cells can be responsible for the development of PDAC. This is believed to occur via a process termed ?acinar-to-ductal metaplasia? (ADM), during which a differentiated cell type (acinar) is reversibly replaced with another mature, differentiated cell type, a condition also visible during inflammation, thereby underlining the predisposition of chronic pancreatitis patients to PDAC. Pancreatic differentiation 2 (PD2), also known as polymerase associated factor-1 (Paf1), has been found to be overexpressed in PDAC and to exhibit oncogenic potential. Our previous studies have further defined the role of PD2/Paf1 in cell cycle regulation and in inducing chromatin structure remodeling in PDAC cells. We have also demonstrated that PD2/Paf1 plays a major role in the multi-lineage differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells and maintains pancreatic cancer stem cells (PCSCs). Our preliminary efforts to investigate the expression of PD2/Paf1 in KrasG12D;Pdx1Cre mouse model of PDAC showed that it is differentially overexpressed in neoplastic pancreatic ducts during murine PDAC progression, as compared to its strictly acinar expression in normal pancreas. PD2/Paf1 was specifically expressed in `intermediate structures' expressing both acinar and ductal specific markers, representing `transitional cells' during pancreatic acinar to ductal metaplasia. Further, we found that PD2/Paf1 is overexpressed along with PCSCs markers in PDAC progression in mouse tissues and isolated CSCs. The multi-potent property of these CSCs allows them to differentiate into several cell types. Therefore, the overall goal of this study is to define the role of PD2/Paf1 in trans-differentiation of acinar cells to ductal cells during PDAC progression, through lineage- differentiation of pancreatic CSC population. Based on these observations our central hypothesis is that ?PD2/Paf1 plays a significant role in the process of acinar-to-ductal metaplasia, thereby contributing to PDAC progression, and its overexpression contributes to the ductal lineage-differentiation of pancreatic CSCs.? To test this hypothesis, Aim 1 will focus on investigating the potential link of PD2/Paf1 in acinar-to-ductal metaplasia using cerulein-induced mouse model of PDAC progression. Aim 2 will elucidate the mechanism(s) of PD2/Paf1 in acinar-to-ductal metaplasia using acinar cells, organoid 3D-cultures, and PD2-/- animals. In Aim 3, we will understand the functional mechanism of PD2/Paf1 in ductal lineage-differentiation of pancreatic CSCs in PDAC progression. Taken together, understanding of novel roles of PD2/Paf1 in ADM progression through stem-like cell differentiation will lead to critical information for the long-term goal of developing novel, targeted therapy against PDAC."
"9311982","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT A critical stage in early breast tumorigenesis is the emergence of preneoplastic cells that carry key tumor drivers but remain in a latent state similar to normal quiescent cells. Such latent preneoplastic cells have been reported in precancerous lesions and tissues surrounding tumors, and are implicated as precursors for primary and recurrent or second field tumors. Despite advances in detection, little is known about the properties of preneoplastic cells to predict or prevent tumor formation. Our long-term goal is to understand the cellular controls in preneoplastic cells and to exploit these controls for developing novel prognostic markers and tumor prevention strategies. The quiescence and outgrowth of latent preneoplastic cells has important implications in driving tumor formation. Here, we propose to investigate this proliferative control in preneoplastic breast cells with hyperactivated AKT signaling, a major tumor driver found in early lesions of the breast and many other epithelial tissues. A major barrier to studying latent preneoplastic cells at a quiescent state is the lack of experimental models. To overcome this, we recently devised specialized organoid and in vivo models of quiescent preneoplastic cells by inducing oncogenic alterations in growth-arrested 3D organoids of non- transformed human mammary cells and by direct engineering cells in intact mouse mammary glands. Using these models, we recently reported that aberrant AKT activation in preneoplastic breast cells induces a primed quiescent cell state that maintains growth arrest under normal conditions, but promotes selective proliferation in tumor-promoting microenvironments. To gain insight into this cell state, our preliminary studies revealed a unique cell cycle program with concurrent upregulation of cell cycle inhibitor, p57Kip2 (p57), and promoter, cyclin D1. This increase in p57 protein abundance is also evidence in AKT-induced preneoplastic cells in mice. Notably, we found that attenuating this AKT-induced p57 upregulation is sufficient to drive these quiescent preneoplastic cells to proliferate and that downregulation of p57 protein level is linked to proliferative outgrowth in tumor-promoting microenvironments. These findings lead us to hypothesize that a p57-mediated cell cycle program controls the maintenance and outgrowth of a primed quiescent state induced by AKT in latent breast preneoplastic cells. We propose three aims to 1) define the molecular identity and induction mechanism of this AKT-induced cell cycle program, 2) elucidate the regulatory role of p57 in the proliferative control of these quiescent preneoplastic cells, and 3) determine the role of p57 in mediating mammary preneoplastic development in mice. These studies will reveal the functional role and the underlying mechanism, as well as provide insights into the prognostic value, of p57 in the progression of preneoplastic breast lesions with aberrant AKT activation. More broadly, our studies will advance our understanding in the control of preneoplastic development at the cellular level, which will provide the mechanistic bases for developing novel prognostic markers and tumor prevention strategies for individuals with increased breast cancer risk."
"9233752","Project IV: Computational Analysis of piRNA Biogenesis, Function, and Evolution Zhiping Weng, P. I. Project Summary piRNAs are the most recently discovered class of small silencing RNAs. They are primarily expressed in gonads, processed from long noncoding transcripts, and function to suppress expression of transposons and other repetitive elements. Failure of the piRNA pathway can activate transposons, compromise germline genome integrity, and cause sterility. Despite recent progress, many questions regarding the biogenesis and functions of piRNAs remain unanswered. What features distinguish piRNA-producing loci from the mRNAs that are not processed into piRNAs? The genomic structures of most piRNA loci are not precisely defined, hampering the identification of distinguishing sequence and structural features. What are the biological functions of mouse pachytene piRNAs? Since the majority of these piRNAs map to unique locations in the genome, it is unclear what they target or even if they have a function at all. How conserved are the components of the piRNA pathway in evolution? To address these questions, this project will use bioinformatic approaches to integrate high-throughput sequencing data with genetic and biochemical data. Much of the data require for this project are already available, and we will take advantage of the experimental data to be generated by the other projects of the PPG. Our results will inevitably lead to hypotheses, which will be tested experimentally via collaboration with the other projects. The project has three aims. Aim 1. To characterize the transcript structure of piRNA-producing genomic loci. Aim 2. To quantify the target recognition requirements of worm piRNAs and identify the functions of pachytene and mRNA-derived piRNAs in mouse. Aim 3. To study the evolution of the piRNA pathway. Relevance This project uses bioinformatic approaches to integrate high-throughput sequencing data with genetic and biochemical data to study the biogenesis, function and evolution of the piRNA pathways in mouse, fly and worm. Our results will provide insight into the mechanisms of germline development and ultimately benefit human fertility. 1"
"9244206","PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal will continue the longstanding focus of this research program in 3 related areas: 1) the molecular pathogenesis of disorders in von Willebrand factor (VWF) function, 2) the genetic factors that modify the manifestations of other inherited bleeding and blood clotting diseases, and 3) regulation of protein transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus and its role in the pathogenesis of blood diseases. VWF is a key component of the blood coagulation system whose deficiency resulting in the most common inherited bleeding disorder in humans, von Willebrand disease (VWD). Elevated levels of VWF are a major risk factor for thrombosis, with loss of VWF processing by ADAMTS13 resulting in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). This project will exploit recent transformative advances in genomic technology to uncover novel pathways contributing to the control of VWF and ADAMTS13 function and lay the foundation for a ?precision medicine? approach to these disorders. A novel VWF regulatory gene previously mapped to human chromosome 2 will be identified through genomic sequence analysis in an additional large cohort of human subjects and its function explored through modeling by ?genome editing? in laboratory mice. Similar tools will be used to characterize a novel modifier gene for TTP susceptibility mapped to mouse chromosome 5. We will also assemble a comprehensive dataset for the functional impact of all possible single amino acid substitutions within the VWF A1 and A2 domains to provide a complete inventory of potential human mutations causing type 2A, 2M and 2B VWD. These data will address the increasingly important clinical problem of ?variant of uncertain significance?, a key challenge for the entire field of human genetics, and should lay the foundation for eventual diagnosis and subclassification of VWD on the basis of DNA sequence alone, enabling true ?precision medicine?, and serving as a useful paradigm for other genetic diseases. This program will also focus on identifying novel genes that contribute to venous thromboembolic (VTE) disease susceptibility, both by direct genomic sequence analysis in human VTE patients, as well as a broad whole genome mutagenesis screen for thrombosis suppressor genes in laboratory mice. Finally, in a ?bedside? to ?bench? translation, the lab has broadened its studies of the rare inherited bleeding disorder, combined deficiency of factors V and VIII, to explore the basic function of cellular transport pathways leading to unexpected insights into the molecular pathogenesis of congenital dyserythropoietic anemia II and the regulation of plasma cholesterol levels. These findings are now circling back from the ?bench? to the ?bedside?, with the potential to provide improved diagnosis and therapy for related diseases. Taken together, this research program will apply cutting-edge genetic and genomic technologies to identify critical genes modifying the risk and severity for a number of blood and heart diseases, as well as yielding information about fundamental biologic processes that could lay the ground work for future novel approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders."
"9243196","Aging is a major risk factor for both the development of primary tuberculosis (TB) disease and for the conversion of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) infection to active TB disease. As a consequence, persons over the age of 65 have the highest TB case rate and are the most susceptible to TB associated death. The immunological factors that contribute to the increased susceptibility of the elderly to TB remain largely unknown. The overarching hypothesis of this program project is that specific changes in inflammatory pathways (termed inflammaging) mediate unique and sub-optimal re-programming in pulmonary and systemic immunity during aging, and worsen the outcome of M.tb infection in the elderly. Project 1 will analyze how pulmonary surfactant and complement contribute to the loss of alveolar complexity within the aging lung and modify the initial cellular interaction with M.tb. Project 2 will address age-associated changes in the function of alveolar macrophages and how they affect M.tb infection. Project 3 will determine the impact of aging and inflammaging on control of primary and latent M.tb infection in old mice. Project 4 will investigate M.tb specific monocyte and T cell function in elderly subjects with latent or active TB. Altogether, these studies will provide mechanistic information to understand how inflammaging and immune senescence impact M.tb infection in the elderly. The program brings together an established group of collaborative scientists with expertise in clinical TB, TB pathogenesis and the immune response to infection, the latter both in human and animal models."
"9328485","Abstract  A prosperous 21st Century society requires a highly skilled workforce in areas that drive economic growth particularly in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). While America has for decades been able to attract some of the best and brightest foreign STEM talents, the nation has neglected to build a strong homegrown STEM workforce. Now a rapid demographic change is underway where individuals that are currently labeled as minorities and are underrepresented in the STEM workforce will soon be in the majority. Additionally, fierce competition for international STEM talents will increase and will leave America at risk to loose its leadership in scientific research and technological innovation. Thus, building the American STEM workforce of the future should be a priority! Effective training opportunities must be developed to specifically engage individuals from groups currently underrepresented in the STEM workforce.  We established such a research-training program in 2007 and recruited undergraduate students from underrepresented minority (URM) and socioeconomically disadvantaged communities nation-wide. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) supported our efforts and 213 students were trained in biomedical research relevant to the mission of NIDDK. Close to 90% of our alumni majored with a STEM degree and 75% of them entered graduate school. The majority (69%) entered or has since completed a doctoral degree program (MD, PhD, MD/PhD or equivalent). Fifteen percent of graduates are in a gap year (i.e., post-bac program, employment etc.). We consider this a highly successful program outcome!  We propose to continue our effective recruitment and research-training strategy, but we will build a more comprehensive career development and mentoring component in order to provide our alumni with stronger support to navigate their career paths. We will organize a Pre-Internship Conference to hold interactive career development workshops. Students will complete an Individual Development Plan (IDP) to develop achievable scientific, academic and professional goals. Interns and their research mentors will join the National Research Mentoring Network (NRMN) to foment a long-term mentor ? mentee relationship. A series of interactive video focused on the diversity of STEM career paths will be created. Finally, the impact of these new activities on student outcomes will be evaluated."
"9245078","The osteochondral (OC) tissues of hyaline articular cartilage, calcified cartilage and subchondral bone operate collectively, thus the degeneration of any one inevitably influences the others. Pressurization of interstitial fluid in healthy cartilage protects cells from excessive tissue strain under large joint contact forces. In osteoarthritis (OA), extracellular matrix degradation results in vastly increased cartilage tissue permeability and diminished mechanical properties and function. Concomitantly, degenerative processes (e.g., vascular invasion and microfractures) create new routes for fluid efflux through calcified cartilage and into the underlying subchondral bone. Thus mechanical and biochemical signaling between OC tissues are perturbed. Moreover an interplay exists between tissue strain and interstitial fluid flows (iFFs) that stimulates bone cells to alter bone structure and, consequently, their mechanical environment (e.g., subchondral bone thickens substantially in late-stage OA). In particular, osteocytes, which are resident cells within bone, sense and respond to iFF changes, to disrupt homeostatic regulation of bone mass through several established mechanosensory pathways (e.g., PGE2 and Wnt/?-catenin signaling). Thus our overarching hypothesis for this research is that the changes to cartilage at the onset of OA, which lead to higher permeability, affect the iFF in subchondral bone and alter osteocyte signaling by releasing PGE2 among other molecules and activating Wnt/?-catenin signaling, which signals osteoblasts and leads to the observed pathophysiological phenotype of increased subchondral bone mass. To test this hypothesis, we will establish a novel 3D tri-layered hydrogel that emulates the complex flow behavior of OC tissues under dynamic compressive forces. Tri-layered hydrogels will be designed with a soft layer that experiences large strains and induces iFF into the bony layer, an intermediate layer whose crosslink density is tuned for permeability to control fluid velocity, and finally a stiff bony layer comprised of an engineered lacunocanalicular network of osteocytes that experience highly dynamic fluid flow with minimal strains. We have outlined two specific aims. In specific aim #1, we will develop tri-layer hydrogels that possess moduli and permeability characteristics to emulate iFF behavior of healthy and osteoarthritic bone tissue using a combined experimental and computational approach. In specific aim #2, we will perform a series of experiments to study the mechanisms by which osteocytes, when embedded in an engineered lacunocanalicular network in the stiff bony layer of the tri-layer hydrogels, respond to different levels of iFF. Upon completion of this project, we expect to have developed a tri-layered hydrogel that captures the unique iFF behavior in healthy and osteoarthritic OC tissues and determined the role of iFF in mediating osteocyte signaling. Long-term, this platform will enable us to study the dynamic conversation between chondrocytes, osteoblasts, and osteocytes under healthy and osteoarthritic mechanical environments and provide novel insights into the role of mechanical cues in the progression of whole joint OA. !"
"9208807","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this mentored career development award is to facilitate the PI's transition to independence as a physician-scientist with clinical expertie in neuromuscular medicine and a research emphasis in the molecular mechanisms of peripheral neuropathies. The proposed research, to be conducted under the guidance of primary mentor Dr. Aaron DiAntonio, will evaluate Sarm1 as a therapeutic target in neuropathies, identify other components of the Sarm1 axon destruction pathway and investigate how components downstream of Sarm 1 interact with it and each other to control axon degeneration (AxD). AxD is a prominent feature of most neuropathies and also occurs early in several other neurodegenerative disorders. However, no treatments currently exist that target axonal degeneration specifically. Recently, it was discovered that knocking down the Toll-like receptor adaptor Sarm1 dramatically protects axons from acute degeneration after axotomy. This clearly implicates Sarm1 as an effector in the pathway mediating acute AxD and gives hope that inhibition of Sarm1 and its downstream components may be useful therapeutically. However, a major limitation for translating Sarm1 into candidate therapeutics is our lack of knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that underlie its axodestructive actions. In view of these considerations we propose a research program guided by the following specific aims: 1) Determine, using behavioral, electrodiagnostic and histopathological methods, if Sarm1 knock out ameliorates vincristine induced neuropathy 2) Identify proteins that function downstream in the Sarm1 destructive pathway using a candidate-based suppressor screen in dorsal root ganglion neurons. 3) Investigate the functional interactions of Sarm1 and a recently identified suppressor (Fbxo7) using biochemical, anatomical, and molecular genetics methods in combination with live cell imaging. The proposed experiments are expected to reveal previously unknown mechanisms of AxD and identify new therapeutic targets in neuropathies. The research training supported by the requested funds will parallel the PI's clinical focus in neuromuscular medicine and provide a skill set and possibly new therapeutic agents for translating basic science discoveries into treatment strategies relevant to patients with neuropathies and possibly other neurodegenerative diseases."
"9243291","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Depopulation affects service and infrastructure provision, quality of life, and the long-term social, demographic, and economic viability of communities and regions. It is also likely to disproportionately affect some groups more than others. The main objective of this project is to remedy our lack of knowledge about the geography and pervasiveness of population decline in United States, the characteristics of those living in depopulating areas, and the demographic change occurring in locations losing population. Population change data are integrated with information regarding the demographic sources of population loss (i.e. migration versus natural decline), characteristics of inhabitants (age structure, racial/ethnic composition, and poverty levels), and measures of change in these variables for U.S. counties and, where appropriate, census tracts. The investigation will show how declining areas differ from growing areas in terms of demographic characteristics as well as recent change in those characteristics. Furthermore, this research will generate new information about the characteristics of those exposed to population decline at multiple spatial scales, which will provide a more nuanced identification of those vulnerable to the impacts of population decline. To achieve its objectives, the project will use geographical information systems (GIS), descriptive analysis, and spatial regression models and exploratory spatial statistics. Datasets will be created that integrate county and census tract data for 2000-2010 as well as county-level historical population data, estimates of the components of demographic change for 2000-2010, and county-to-county migration flow data for the same period. These data will be used to develop a typology of population change across U.S. counties based on population change for the area, its historical change, and the change experienced by surrounding areas. Data are tabulated across types of areas in order to measure the demographic characteristics of those exposed to each category of population change and to assess community- and region-level demographic changes occurring in both depopulating and growing places. Explanatory regression models are constructed that estimate the impact of location in a particular type of changing area on demographic outcomes. Spillover effects across neighboring areas are estimated with spatial regression models."
"9442460","Description: Liver tolerance was first identified in the 1960s in the context of experimental liver transplantation. In many species, an allogeneic liver transplant will survive in an immune-competent recipient, without immunosuppression. This reveals an underlying bias towards immune tolerance to multiple liver antigens, including those encoded by transgenes (neo-self antigens), viruses and parasites. Many mechanisms have been proposed to explain liver tolerance, but there is no satisfactory model that unites them. The purpose of this project is to test two potential mechanisms and determine if they are mechanistically linked. Abundant evidence, including some generated by our lab, supports the concept that failure of CD8+ T  cell immunity in the liver is due to lack of CD4+ T cell help, resulting in CD8+ T cell loss of function  and clonal exhaustion. Other evidence, including Preliminary Data we present here, suggests that  immunosuppressive molecules are induced in liver cells, in particular Liver Sinusoidal Endothelial  Cells, by Interferon?gamma. Our central novel idea is that these two mechanisms of tolerance are  linked, and the Preliminary Data strongly implicate Liver Sinusoidal Endothelial cells. In Specific Aim  1 we will test the hypothesis that Liver Sinusoidal Endothelial Cells are central in controlling CD4+ T  cell activation and thereby immunity versus tolerance, while in Specific Aim 2 we will test whether  Interferon?gamma regulates the function of Liver Sinusoidal Endothelial Cells to induce tolerance. We  have optimized an AAV?based model of liver tolerance to test these concepts, however the possibility  remains open that they are unique to the model. Therefore in Specific Aim 3 we test the same concepts  in a mouse model of Hepatitis B infection. If the concepts hold in both models, we argue that they  reveal a generally applicable mechanism of tolerance.     The relationship between IFN?induced negative feedback, also known as Adaptive Tolerance, and  CD4+ T cell help may hold in other tissues. Therefore, clarification of this relationship will be of broad  immunological interest, and may have significance in models of infection, immunity and  immunopathology in many organ systems.  "
"9244831","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Injectable contraceptives are extensively used in Sub-Saharan Africa, where the incidence and prevalence of AIDS is high. There are many different forms of contraception, which vary in the method of delivery and type of synthetic compound (progestin). Progestins are designed to mimic the actions of progesterone, the active contraceptive ingredient. Clinical studies suggest that some, in particular the injectable contraceptive Depo Provera, but not other progestins, increase the risk of HIV-1 infection and transmission, particularly in young women. Young women are most at risk and also have the greatest need for effective contraception. Access to affordable and safe contraception is an enormous public health issue, affecting millions of women worldwide and particularly in the developing world. Since the current data from observational clinical studies do not provide sufficient information regarding the safety of hormonal contraceptives, particularly injectable medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) or Depo Provera, more research is urgently required to shed light on this important issue. Ex vivo studies on human female reproductive tract tissue likely represent the best method to obtain answers about the differential and direct effects and mechanisms of progestins on gene expression and cell functions relevant to HIV-1 acquisition. Steroid receptors, which control responses to progestins, play a key role in choice of progestin. Although different progestins exhibit similar mechanisms of action via the progesterone receptor, they have very different off-target effects on expression of genes that regulate immune function and many cellular processes, via binding to other steroid receptors, such as those for cortisol and androgens. This study will focus on the effects and mechanisms of action of four different progestins, at physiologically relevant concentrations, on expression of select genes previously identified as being important in HIV-1 transmission and pathogenesis in the female genital tract. Effects will be investigated in vitro, in several HIV-1 target cell and tissue model, including cervical tissue explants, primary genital epithelial cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and isolated T-cells and dendritic cells. Vaginal delivery of anti-retroviral (ARV) drugs as microbicides has emerged as a potentially effective prophylactic strategy. Vaginal delivery of a combined ARV with a progestin contraceptive offers an attractive strategy for both prevention of HIV-1 acquisition and prevention of pregnancy. However, limited information is available regarding the best choice of progestin contraceptive to combine with an ARV. Detailed ex vivo model studies are needed to define the optimal and safe combination of progestin and antiretroviral. Mechanistic studies addressing the effects on inflammation, integrity of the genita tract barrier, secretion of key defense molecules, and studies addressing how steroid receptor levels affect these processes will be performed. The results should provide key insights into choice of progestin alone and in combination with ARV for maximal protection of young women from HIV-1 infection."
"9252527","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to isolate well-characterized human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (iCM) from mixed cell populations is a fundamental and major unfulfilled goal of cardiac regenerative medicine, disease modeling and drug discovery efforts. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop a clinically- applicable method for high-throughput isolation of purified ventricular iCM, one of the most sought after cell types for translational applications. The isolation strategy is based on immunophenotyping, wherein functional potential, identity, and isolation of clinically-relevant cells are achieved via panels of antibodies that recognize exposed surface markers. Our preliminary studies have identified more than 40 informative cell surface markers for this purpose and we have developed novel monoclonal antibodies to one novel cell surface protein not previously described in the heart. We have already determined that several of these markers are restricted to specific chambers in the heart, indicating they will be highly informative for sorting subtype-specific iCM in vitro. The work will be carried out in two Aims designed to test the hypothesis that antibodies to cell surface proteins can be used to isolate ventricular iCM (Aim 1) and to determine their functional role in ventricular cardiomyogenesis (Aim 2). This work will contribute a new, non-transgene based high-throughput method for isolating live ventricular cardiomyocytes, which is not possible by current methodologies. The significance of this proposal lies with the functional outcomes enabled by the technological developments, as when an informative marker panel for sorting stage and subtype specific cells is developed, this will enable the reproducible isolation of ventricular iCM suitable for drug-discovery, therapeutic, and disease modeling studies."
"9242081","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The accumulation of misfolded proteins represents a common pathological mechanism of most major neurodegenerative disorders. Neuronal inclusions comprised of aggregated a-Synuclein (aSyn) are known as Lewy bodies (LBs) and Lewy-neurites (LNs), and represent a key histopathological feature of Parkinson's disease (PD), and a family of related disorders known as synucleinopathies that affect as many as 1 million individuals in the U.S. alone. Mutations in the SNCA gene encoding aSyn also cause familial PD but while histological and genetic evidence firmly indicate a correlation between aSyn accumulation and disease, how aSyn pathology forms and whether it directly contributes to disease remains unclear. Abnormal aSyn catalyzes the misfolding of the normal protein and it has recently been demonstrated that minute quantities of aSyn aggregates can trigger the formation of toxic LBs/LNs in cultured neurons. Misfolded aSyn also induces the formation of LBs/LNs in healthy non-transgenic mice. In both human PD and animal models, aSyn pathology progressively propagates and spreads to neuroanatomically connected regions, reminiscent of prion diseases. Importantly, animals with LBs/LNs recapitulate the cardinal features of PD, including progressive loss of dopamine-producing neurons and locomotor deficits. This proposed research plan addresses key biological questions posed by these findings, and combines novel in vitro, cell-based, and in vivo tools to further understand how LBs/LNs are form, propagate, and ultimately contribute to neurodegeneration and neurological symptoms. Aim 1 examines whether neurons in multiple brain regions develop LBs/LNs following inoculation with misfolded recombinant aSyn and subsequently undergo cell death. A recently developed tissue processing method will be used to determine if LBs/LNs spread via neuronal projections, as hypothesized for human PD, or by other mechanisms. Behavioral tests will then reveal if specific clinicopathological correlations exist. Aim 2 will define the molecular interactions that govern how abnormal aSyn triggers the conversion of normal aSyn in LBs/LNs, by testing the ability of mutant aSyn sequences to seed pathology in both cells and in vivo following stereotactic injection. Finally, Aim 3 will elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which aSyn induce intracellular pathology by using cell-based, in vivo, and proteomics approaches to compare LB/LN-inducing and non-inducing aSyn mutants that we have recently discovered. Completion of these studies should provide valuable insights into the potential mechanisms by which aSyn contribute to the progression of PD. Increased understanding of the pathogenesis of this and related synucleinopathies should ultimately result in disease-modifying therapies for this group of incurable disorders."

"9437906","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite recent efforts to expand reach of smoking cessation treatment options beyond clinic based care, smoking cessation treatment including the use of smoking cessation aids remain greatly underutilized. If cessation programs are to have significant impact (Impact = Reach X Efficacy) on changing health behavior at the population level, there is a fundamental need to develop new and innovative strategies to increase treatment intensity, access, and participation. The use of intensive behavioral therapies, such as contingency management (CM), have demonstrated efficacy for reducing smoking in difficult-to-treat populations, but have had limited reach given the need to verify abstinence multiple times daily via clinic based monitoring. The development of a mobile health (mHealth) platform to provide CM has made the use of intensive CM approaches portable and feasible. The primary goal of the current study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a proactive tele-health intervention that combines evidenced based treatment for smoking cessation with smart- phone based, portable contingency management on smoking rates. The central hypothesis is that increasing the intensity of available tele-health smoking approaches through the addition of mobile CM will be an effective way to reduce smoking rates in Veterans returning from the Iraq/Afghanistan wars. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested in a comparative effectiveness trial with a two-group design in which 260 Veteran smokers will be randomized to receive either a mCM intervention which combines evidenced based cognitive-behavioral telephone counseling (TC), a tele-medicine clinic for access to nicotine replacement (NRT), and mCM administered through a smart phone or to a control condition that will provide controls for therapist, medication, time and attention effects. Specific aims are to evaluate (1) the impact of mCM on rates of abstinence from cigarettes as measured by bio-verified, self-reported prolonged abstinence at 3-month, 6-month, and 12 month post-randomization follow-up, (2) the relative cost-effectiveness of the mCM intervention in quality adjusted life years (QALY), and (3) potential treatment mediators including self-efficacy and treatment process mechanisms. The approach is innovative because it builds upon advances in mHealth technology and will be the first evaluation of smart phone based mobile CM in conjunction with other evidence- based smoking cessation treatment for OEF/OIF/OND Veterans. There is a surprising lack of research aimed at evaluating multi-component smoking cessation interventions that integrate CM with evidence-based cognitive-behavioral treatment and smoking cessation aids such as NRT. Cigarette smoking remains the most lethal substance use disorder in the United States and military veterans are at particular high risk for smoking related morbidity and mortality. The significance of identifying cost-effective approaches to decreasing tobacco use in the relatively young and at-risk cohort of returning Veterans could be tremendous as it will prevent significant morbidity and mortality."
"9438391","PROJECT SUMMARY Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is the most prevalent myopathy afflicting males and females, children and adults. In the majority of clinical FSHD cases, muscle weakness is not noticeable until the second or third decade of life followed by a progressive pathology impacting many facets of everyday life, ranging from being unable to comb ones own hair or walk the dog to including having to change or abandon careers, loss of independence and, in ~20% of FSHD patients, becoming wheelchair bound an/or require aid in breathing. Currently there are no treatments to slow down, stop, or reverse disease progression. Recent advances have identified the aberrant expression of the DUX4 transcription factor as the primary initiator of the FSHD pathogenic cascade of events. In vitro studies have identified numerous DUX4-mediated events that have adverse effects on cell viability and function and could conceivably lead to muscle disease if they were to happen in the context of an actual person. However, due to the complexities of FSHD and the lack of any valid animal model for FSHD, which, if any, of these pathways actually has pathogenic relevance. We have successfully generated and validated a phenotypic FSHD-like mouse model based on DUX4 expression. This allows, for the first time, the interrogation of downstream effects of DUX4 expression as to potential roles in pathophysiology and validation as therapeutic targets. We will initially focus on the innate immune response. The major gene expression signature from FSHD muscle biopsies indicates the immune response is highly activated in FSHD muscle. Many other muscular dystrophies have immune system components and there are many available ameliorative treatments for these muscular dystrophies that target the inflammatory response. Identifying the inflammatory response as a key mechanism in developing FSHD pathology would be a significant advance and open many new avenues for therapeutic intervention. In addition, the design of the model allows us to initiate DUX4 expression in adult animals. Therefore, we will use our FSHD-like mouse model to identify potential biomarkers of disease progression and compare with what has been found in human biospecimens. Importantly, in our mice we will be able to distinguish early, initiating events from those due to long-term cumulative effects and this may help determine which biomarkers correlate more directly with DUX4 expression and are the best to follow as the field moves to clinical trials."
"9235298","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rates of obesity and obesity related chronic health conditions are higher in adolescents with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD) than those in the general population. Many of the negative health consequences observed in obese adults are already present in obese adolescents with IDD. To explore both diets and delivery systems, we completed a 2 month self-funded trial to assess the feasibility of using a technology driven system for weight management in adolescents with IDD. Twenty-two overweight/obese (BMI > 85th percentile) adolescents with mild to moderate IDD parent were randomized to a weight loss intervention using either an enhanced Stop Light Diet (enhanced with portion controlled meals (eSLD); n=11) or a Conventional Diet (CD); n=11). All participants received support from a parent. All participants received a progressive physical activity program that targeted an increase in steps ~3,000/day above baseline. Program delivery was achieved utilizing existing technology including an iPad using the FaceTimeTM application for weekly meetings and diet and physical activity was monitored using either a standard pedometer or the FitBit pedometer and Lose it! Application synced to the iPad. Twenty adolescents (11 boys, 9 girls: mean age 14.9 ( +/- 2.2) years; BMI percentile = 93.4 (+/- 6.3) percent; 30 percent minorities) completed the study. The mean weight loss at 2 months was 4.6 (+/-0.8) percent and 3.1 (+/-0.8) percent in the eSLD and CD groups, respectively. The lack of external funding prohibited a longer trial. To estimate the magnitude of weight loss that might be expected over 6 months, the time frame for weight loss in the proposed study, we assumed the rate of weight loss for months 1-2 observed in the pilot study and reduced this by 50 percent. This results in a projected weight loss at 6 months of 6.9 percent and 4.6 percent for the eSLD and CD groups, respectively. We now propose a 3 group randomized trial to evaluate the intervention delivery system and type of reduced energy diet. We will randomize 123 overweight/obese adolescents with mild to moderate IDD to one of 3 groups for an 18 month trial (6 month weight loss; 12 month weight maintenance): group 1) Face-To-Face/CD; group 2) Technology delivery/CD; group 3) Technology delivery/eSLD. All participants will receive a progressive program of physical activity. FTF will meet with a health educator and will track progress using pen and paper records for both physical activity and diet. TECH groups will receive the intervention using an iPad with the FaceTimeTM application for video meetings with a health educator and will track progress using the Lose it! application for both physical activity and diet. We will be adequately powered to compare which diet and which delivery system provides the most promising results with weight at 6 months as the primary outcome. Secondarily, we will determine if weight loss is maintained long-term (18 months) and will have extensive process analysis to determine relationships between energy balance variables, process variables, and psychosocial variables. Lastly, we will complete a cost analysis to determine if the use of technology reduces costs compared to the traditional face-to-face delivery system."
"9225245","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a proposal to provide protected time for Dr. Drake to provide greater mentoring to junior clinical investigators as well as increase her capacity to expand her clinical investigations in interstitial lung disease. Dr. Drake proposes a mentoring plan which will facilitate the effective transition from junior clinical investigator to research scientist. She provides a detailed description of her own augmentation of further training in clinical trial implementation. Her current research projects are thematically linked through their focus on molecular and immunologic determinants of sarcoidosis clinical outcome for the purpose of identifying novel therapeutic interventions. In particular, her research focuses on the contribution of mycobacterial induction of T cell dysfunction to sarcoidosis disease progression, and the capacity of antimycobacterial therapy to restore T cell function. Trainees have been involved in many aspects of the ongoing patient-oriented research including study design, patient accrual, data collection, laboratory assays and analysis and presentation of findings. The transformative nature of the proposal is to investigate the safety of Nivolumab, an antibody against human Programmed Death-1, in patients with chronic pulmonary sarcoidosis. This investigation will allow the translation of molecular mechanisms identified at the bench to immune function within the host. The proof-of-concept data obtained from this K24 investigation will serve a pilot data for a Phase II clinical investigation of the efficacy of Nivolumab on a clinical endpoint associated with sarcoidosis mortality, absolute FVC."
"9223483","Transcriptional Regulatory Complexes in Epidermal Differentiation  Project Summary  My long-term career goal is to lead a productive academic group at a research university, advancing the field of epithelial biology, and serving as a mentor to young scientists. My scientific interests lie in understanding the complex biology behind transcriptional regulatory networks mediating epidermal homeostasis. As I build a solid research program in this area, my immediate goals are to obtain mentorship in new areas, including epigenomics, bioinformatics, and proteomics, which will greatly enhance my current expertise in genetics, biochemistry and molecular biology. In addition to the valuable expertise provided by my mentor, six additional faculty members at Stanford University with expertise in these areas have agreed to serve as collaborators for the proposed studies. Furthermore, I will acquire additional knowledge through limited didactic courses, and participation in leadership and management seminars offered at Stanford will further prepare me for my transition to independence. Altogether, these efforts will allow me to expand my current research to provide a platform for establishing a new research group and aid in my transition to independent investigator.  The goal of this K01 proposal is to investigate the transcriptional regulatory complexes involved in epidermal differentiation. I have recently identified the MAF/MAFB transcription factors (TFs) as critical regulators of epidermal homeostasis mediating progenitor cell cycle exit and terminal differentiation. These TFs are themselves regulated by long non-coding RNAs and mediate downstream activation of important epidermal TFs in cooperation with p63, the master regulator of epidermis. Furthermore, our analysis revealed MAF/MAFB localized to putative enhancers at the genomic level. Due to their ability to both suppress progenitor genes and activate terminal differentiation genes, we believe MAF/MAFB exist simultaneously in activating and repressive complexes. Thus, the aims are to 1) Characterize the epigenomic effects of MAF/MAFB during epidermal differentiation and, 2) Functionally characterize the MAF/MAFB protein interactome to understand how MAF/MAFB function in activating and repressive complexes.  We will begin by determining the epigenomic effects of MAF/MAFB in Aim I. The contribution of MAF/MAFB to chromatin accessibility and genome architecture will be addressed in the context of MAF/MAFB CRISPR-mediated knockout keratinocytes. We will use ATAC-seq to identify changes in chromatin accessibility comparing MAF/MAFB loss to control differentiated keratinocytes. To assess changes in genome shape, we will interrogate promoter:DNA contacts using capture Hi-C in control vs MAF/MAFB knockout keratinocytes that have undergone differentiation. These unbiased approaches will provide genome-wide data for characterizing the epigenome during epidermal differentiation, assessing the impact of MAF/MAFB loss, and identifying critical genomic regulatory elements required for differentiation. Furthermore, characterization of regulatory elements will allow for subsequent identification of additional factors, or potential co-regulators, involved in MAF/MAFB mediated gene regulation. We will first test candidate co-regulators already identified through FOCIS analysis of MAF/MAFB bound loci and then incorporate results from epigenomic studies to identify and characterize putative co-regulators.  In Aim II, we will focus on functionally characterizing the MAF/MAFB protein interactome. Because of their ability to suppress progenitor genes and activate differentiation genes, we hypothesized that MAF/MAFB exist simultaneously in activating and repressive complexes to mediate gene expression. We will first characterize the MAF/MAFB interactome using tandem affinity purification and a proximal protein biotinylation (BioID) approach coupled with mass spectrometry to identify proteins associating with MAF/MAFB during epidermal differentiation. These approaches will identify stable and transient MAF/MAFB interactors. To functionally characterize candidate MAF/MAFB co-regulators, we have developed a CRISPR/Cas9 screen to identify factors required for terminal differentiation. Candidates that arise from this screen will be validated by gene expression profiling and in tissue models. Taken together, this aim will serve to functionally characterize MAF/MAFB activating and repressive complexes operating during epidermal differentiation.  Over the course of the training period, I plan to have expanded my expertise into the areas of epigenomics, bioinformatics, and proteomics, all while characterizing the complexity of epidermal transcriptional regulation. The findings arising from this proposal will inform the skin biology community of critical DNA regulatory elements required for human epidermal differentiation, how MAF/MAFB participates in functional regulation of these elements, and what additional factors are critical for epidermal differentiation. These findings may form the foundation of future treatment strategies for disorders characterized by disrupted epidermal homeostasis."
"9330521","PROJECT SUMMARY Primary immune deficiencies (PIDs) are a group of rare disorders of the immune system, resulting in increased susceptibility to infections, autoimmunity and malignancies. The most severe forms of PIDs are fatal, unless immune reconstitution is achieved by hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), enzyme replacement or gene therapy. Because of the many disease- and treatment-related variables that may affect outcome after HCT, both careful collection of data in Registries and multicenter collaboration are needed to facilitate analysis of outcome and development of prospective clinical trials. In 2009, the Primary Immune Deficiency Treatment Consortium (PIDTC) was established in North America with the goal of building a North American collaboration to carry-out retrospective, cross-sectional and prospective studies that would define risk factors, long term outcomes and late effects in children with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID), Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS) and Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) who receive HCT or other forms of definitive treatment. In April 2011 the first annual PIDCT Scientific Workshop was held in San Francisco followed by workshops in Boston (2012), Houston (2013), Seattle (2014), Montreal (2015) and Los Angeles (2016). These workshops and Education Days provide a unique and critical forum to assemble experienced and young investigators from all major centers in North America involved in the treatment of these disorders, as well as biostatisticians and Patient Advocacy Groups and have been responsible for initiating the development of national and international collaborations. The proposed 7th PIDTC Scientific Workshop and Education Day in Bethesda, MD (PIDTC2017) will focus on new timely topics to further advance the development of clinical trials aimed at improving treatment of PIDs, immunobiology of PIDs, the microbiome, gene therapy, and collaborations with Patient Advocacy Groups. The specific objectives of the workshops are:  1) To disseminate information on survival, clinical status, and immune function in patients with severe  PIDs who have received HCT or other forms of treatment  2) To initiate data collection and analysis in other forms of severe PIDs that can be treated by HCT  3) To analyze relevance of biological markers that predict successful immune reconstitution following HCT  4) To discuss the results of novel approaches to HCT for PID that may minimize transplant-related toxicity  while allowing robust and durable engraftment and immune reconstitution  5) To develop optimal treatment protocols for newborns with SCID.  6) To prompt development of clinical trials in the field of HCT for PIDs  7) To promote education of young investigators with a specific interest in treatment of PIDs  8) To increase synergy among Patient Advocacy Groups actively involved in PID awareness campaigns"
"9215703","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  DukeMed Activated (DukeMed A+) is an integrated science enrichment program for disadvantaged (DIS) and under-represented minority (URM) students in Durham Public Schools. A seamless continuum of staged components, the program spans grades 3-12 and is designed to: generate and sustain interest in the sciences; build academic skills including verbal, written, critical thinking, and analytic; instill a sense of responsibility to self, peers, community, and society; cultivate capacities for leadership and teamwork; and encourage pursuit of further science education and science-related careers, with a focus on healthcare and biomedical research. Using proven, age-appropriate methods, it engages students in progressively more intensive and challenging activities; methods include inquiry-based learning, hands-on/experiential exercises, mentoring, near-peer mentoring, team-based research projects, direct exposures through immersions and field trips, and cultivation of leadership skills.          Creating a pipeline that prepares DIS/URM students for advanced science education and/or training, DukeMed A+ comprises 4 components, all of which have been tested. DukeMed Elementary provides experiential learning sessions for all 3rd graders in 6 schools, a weekend program for 4th graders, and a hands-on activity in a Duke lab for 5th graders. BOOST offers school-based activities to full science classes in 6th grade, plus one-on-one mentoring, exposures/field trips, and research activities to a subset of motivated DIS/URM students. BOOST XL engages 7th-9th graders in increasingly complex problem-solving and team- based research, with continued mentoring. Scientifica involves 8th-12th graders in research.         An overarching theme, Mind and Body, unifies these program components. Subthemes addressed at each stage (e.g., neurobiology, motion, nutrition/metabolism) are aligned with North Carolina grade-specific science curricula. Teacher professional development and family/community involvement, both major elements of DukeMed A+, create a backdrop of student support and also enhance science teachers' knowledge base and skills, and educate the community about health, cutting-edge science, and research."
"9246336","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with schizophrenia tend to have deficits in a range of learning and memory processes, as well as specific deficits in visual perception. All of these deficits are associated with poor functional outcomes, and current treatments do little to address them. One type of learning that might be important for outcomes, called perceptual learning, is potentially related to both types of deficits but has hardly been studied in schizophrenia. Perceptual learning refers to long-lasting changes in the way that particular sensory stimuli are perceived after they are encountered repeatedly, which are related to changes in the way those stimuli are processed in the brain. Perceptual learning deficits likely exist in schizophrenia, like other types of learning deficits and perceptual deficits, but this hypothesis has not yet been adequately tested. This proposal will evaluate perceptual learning in schizophrenia using behavioral and neural techniques adapted from cognitive neuroscience and vision research. Participants with schizophrenia and healthy controls will perform a perceptual learning task over the course of several days. At the beginning and end of the learning, we will measure the amount of brain activity evoked by stimuli encountered in the training task using electroencephalography (EEG). The first objective of the research will be to determine whether patients show less perceptual learning than controls. The second objective will be to determine whether patients show a different pattern of brain activity changes than controls. The third objective will be to examine how these behavioral and neural measures relate to each other. The research will also explore whether neural changes measured at the beginning of training predict learning outcomes later in training, which would suggest that those early changes are a neural marker of perceptual plasticity. Overall, this perceptual learning-based approach to studying schizophrenia has the potential to lead to new training-based treatments for perceptual abnormalities in the disease, new ways to measure the effects of treatments on perceptual plasticity in schizophrenia, and new insights into the neural basis of the disease."
