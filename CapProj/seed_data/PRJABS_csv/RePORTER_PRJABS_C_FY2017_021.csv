"9414887","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive renewal application to continue training postdoctoral fellows in nephrology research. Our goal is to prepare fellows for a career in Academic Nephrology by training them to use state-of-the-art basic or clinical investigative tools and methods to interrogate important issues in renal physiology and pathophysiology. We will continue to rely on an interdisciplinary approach that involves 20 preceptors from the Renal Division and from the Departments of Immunology, Pediatrics, Physiology, Radiology, and Transplant Surgery, and from the Divisions of Digestive Diseases and Geriatrics. Training is offered in four focus areas: 1) renal tubular physiology; 2) metabolic consequences of renal dysfunction; 3) clinical, translational, and epidemiological research; and 4) transplantation and immunology. Each of the preceptors has an outstanding training record and research funding from the NIH and/or VA. By providing trainees with relevant formal and informal scientific courses and a variety of career development activities while simultaneously immersing them in specific research projects, this program will provide a solid foundation on which to build a career  in Academic Medicine. Two categories of trainees will be chosen: 1) MDs or MD/PhDs from the adult/pediatric Renal Fellowship programs; and 2) PhD candidates. Over the past 10 years, there have been 16 trainees supported by this grant: 6 are full-time medical school faculty members engaged in basic or clinical research; 1 is a health scientist at the CDC; 6 continue to be engaged in full-time research training; 1 is teaching chemistry at a state university; and 2 have entered nephrology practice. Thus, 7 of the 10 trainees (70%) who completed all of their training during 2005-2015 entered academic medicine and are currently full-time faculty members at a medical school or at the CDC. Three of them have received research grants from the NIH or other sources of funding, a 4th has a pending grant application, and a 5th is a CDC scientist funded by intramural CDC funds. Three of the 6 trainees who are still engaged in research training have pending NIH K-grant applications. During the past 10 years, 9 women and 6 members of an under- represented minority group have received support from this T32. Fifteen of 16 trainees have published peer-reviewed papers. We have filled every available position every year since the start of this program in 1990. We seek funding to continue this successful training program."
"9213709","Project Summary/Abstract This project will involve an examination of the impact of a mobile intervention to improve social functioning in schizophrenia using an evidence-based treatment framework to target deficits in social skills and social motivation. Social impairment is a key characteristic of schizophrenia, present prior to onset and predictive of long-term course. The approach of the current project is to use Ecological Momentary Intervention (EMI), administered by mobile phone, to integrate features from social skills training (SST; an evidence-based treatment for schizophrenia) with social motivation support to improve social functioning. Aim 1 of the project will involve iterative development of the mobile application, using expert panel input and conducting usability testing to inform intervention content and approach. As an exploratory aim, social sensing technology (e.g., GPS and automated conversation detection) will be implemented to test the promise of this technology in identifying and intervening in social isolation. In Aim 2, 30 persons with schizophrenia will use the application over a 3-month period. We will test the impact of the application on social motivation (EMA reports of social anticipatory pleasure and presence of social interaction) across the intervention period. We will also examine the impact on social functioning, measured with standard clinician-administered assessments, from baseline to 90-day follow-up. Additional clinical, neurocognitive, and social cognitive assessments will be gathered on study participants to identify potential moderators of outcome and predictors of application usability. This study will result in a better understanding of the feasibility and initial impact of a scalable intervention designed to support lasting, sustainable improvements in social functioning in schizophrenia."
"9233586","ABSTRACT Increasing evidence suggests that autoantibodies antecede overt clinical disease by years, inclusive of anti- SSA/Ro among the earliest reactivities. Predicting who will progress would be a critical translational discovery. Mothers in the Research Registry for Neonatal Lupus (RRNL) represent a unique population at risk for overt clinical autoimmunity. Despite high titer anti-Ro antibodies pathogenic to the developing fetus, many women are asymptomatic and autoimmunity is identified solely based on disease in their offspring. In the RRNL, 243 of 500 mothers were asymptomatic or had minimal symptoms at the birth of the NL child. Nearly half of these mothers later developed systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and/or Sjögren's syndrome (SS). The identification of numerous susceptibility genes disproves a purely environmental cause for autoimmune diseases such as SLE, but susceptibility genes are not sufficient for the development of disease. In fact, the disease probability given the genotype remains modest. These observations strongly imply that gene- environment interactions contribute to the risk of SLE. One environmental factor is an individual's microbiome, given the constant interchange between the immune system and bacterial species whose products prime cells within the innate and adaptive immune systems. We hypothesize that some HLA variation drives a pathologic microbiome which associates with progression from benign to pathologic autoimmunity and overt clinical disease. In addition, other HLA variation may correlate with a protective microbiome and clinical quiescence. In Aim 1, associations will be sought between host genetics and anti-Ro NL maternal disease status. Feasibility of the approach is based on prior genotyping of 147 RRNL mothers using the Illumina Immunochip. From Immunochip SNPs, classical 4-digit HLA alleles have been imputed yielding a total of 119 unique HLA alleles. It will be determined whether SLE risk alleles, identified by the SLE Immunochip Consortium, correlate with maternal disease status, and whether the SLE genetic risk allele load correlates with material disease status. In Aim 2, we will test for associations between gut bacterial species in the context of HLA and anti-Ro NL maternal disease status. Using a DNAseq library from amplification of 16S rRNA gene regions, non-adjusted for maternal HLA, preliminary results of microbiota profiling revealed an abundance of protective Rikenellaceae and Oscillospira in 8 asymptomatic anti-Ro+ NL mothers compared to 35 overt SLE patients. Overall abundance, microbial diversity, and specific operational taxonomic units (OTUs) will be correlated with HLA variation, specific SLE/SS-risk variants, and overall SLE risk allele genetic load. In Aim 3, stool samples will be collected from mothers enrolled in the RRNL who have been previously genotyped but in whom matched samples have not yet been provided. To our knowledge, the proposed experiments will be the first to characterize the impact of a patient's microbiota on a preclinical disease state and to test whether host genetic variation at the MHC locus influences a pathologic microbiome."
"9397602","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tissue morphogenesis, the process that alters the shape of a tissue, is essential for embryonic development. Defects in tissue morphogenesis result in failed organ function and/or formation, as well as the progression of epithelial tumors, thus understanding the mechanism that promotes/regulates morphogenesis is critical. Some morphogenetic events are facilitated by apical constriction, a process that alters a columnar- shaped cell to a wedged-shaped cell. Defects in F-actin inhibit apical constriction, though an understanding of how F-actin dynamics regulate this process is lacking. Current models suggest that stable F-actin promotes apical constriction. During Drosophila gastrulation, apical constriction promotes epithelial bending, facilitating epithelial internalization and tube formatio within the embryo. Available tools and easily visualized morphological events by live imaging, makes Drosophila gastrulation an ideal system for investigating the role(s) for F-actin dynamics during apical constriction and tissue morphogenesis. To investigate how F-actin regulates morphogenesis, our lab has performed an RNAi screen that targeted 66 Drosophila genes that regulate F-actin during gastrulation. This screen identified essential roles for F-actin disassembly in mediating tissue morphogenesis. Loss of F-actin disassembly factors resulted in apical constriction, cell internalization, and/or tissue fusion defect, suggesting that dynamic actn is essential for these processes. F-actin and Myosin II generate apical constrictions in a pulsatile manner; each constriction is stabilized prior to the next. During constrictions, an increase of apical F-actin is observed. During stabilization, this F-actin concentration is lost an apical F-actin cables are present. I hypothesize that apically localized F-actin is disassembled and remodeled into F-actin cables to promote apical constriction. To test my hypothesis, I will determine if F-actin cable formation and apical constriction occurs properly in mutants with hindered F-actin disassembly using high-resolution, live imaging. Additionally, I will further elucidate the role for F-actin during morphogenesis by evaluating how F-actin organization promotes apical constriction. Drosophila abelson (abl) mutants have over abundant, disorganized apical F-actin. abl mutants also exhibit defects in apical constriction, thus I hypothesize that proper F-actin organization are essential for this processes. To test this hypothesis, I will elucidate the mechanism by which Abl promotes F-actin organization via live imaging and quantitative analysis techniques, gaining insight into how F-actin organization promotes apical constriction. Finally, the spatial and temporal regulation of F-actin dynamics during a dynamic process, such as apical constriction, is poorly understood. To further extend analysis of F-actin disassembly to apical constriction and later developmental stages, I will gain in vivo temporal control of the F-actin severing protein cofilin by acute inactivation through relocalization and sequestration. Cofilin inhibition during distinct developmental stages will gain  a further understanding of how F- actin disassembly promotes morphogenesis."
"9316230","Project Summary Malaria is a major public health problem, with an estimated 198 million cases occurring world-wide in 2013. Effective strategies to reduce malaria transmission and disease have been highly successful leading to a 40% reduction in malaria cases in sub-Saharan Africa since 2000. It has been observed that infections cluster geographically and such clustering becomes more pronounced as transmission declines. The science of identifying `hotspots' of infection or foci of transmission is a growing area that promises to help target interventions more effectively. However, it has not been shown whether infected individuals in close physical proximity (i.e. in the same household) are jointly infected due to simply living in a risky place, or because an infected household member is a risk factor for nearby susceptible individuals. If the former, then targeting hotspots should focus on reducing environmental risk factors in the area around a hotpsot. If the latter, then interventions to identify and treat `transmitters' will reduce transmission and reduce the incidence of new cases. Therefore, we need to understand the spatial scale of malaria transmission to predict the impact of community case detection and hotspot targeting. To shed light on this important issue, we propose two scientific objectives. First, we will measure the genetic relatedness of infections within the same household compared to the relatedness of infections at further distances. We will determine whether this relationship differs in fever `hotspots' (geographic clusters of high fever incidence) and fever `coldspots'. Parasite DNA from dried blood spots collected from a moderate endemic study area in western Kenya (approximately 15 km by 28 km encompassing more than 80 villages) will be sequenced at a moderately polymorphic gene using deep sequencing techniques. This will provide evidence for local, focal transmission if nearby infections are more closely related or will point to mixed transmission whereby infections only begin to differ as you reach the distance of mosquito flying ranges. Our second objective is to trap malaria mosquito vectors and identify infected mosquitoes. We will determine the source of the mosquito's infection by sequencing parasites in the mosquito salivary glands and comparing to parasite genotypes in humans. By doing so, we can find out whether infections are being transmitted at a household scale or transmission is `well mixed' geographically and only limited by the range of the mosquito. If successful, this will be the first report of linking individual infections in mosquitoes to their human source. The ability to track infections from human to mosquito and back again would allow us to understand the dynamics and scale of transmission in a way that has not previously been possible. We expect to scale up this approach to larger populations in subsequent studies. These results will provide insight into the expected impact of interventions designed to target hotspots."
"9263255","Project Summary Present and prior information converge often in everyday life. For example, during language comprehension, each syllable achieves its meaning in the context of a word, and each word in the context of a sentence. Despite the clear importance of such integration of past and present, most studies of memory use simple stimuli that are isolated in time. The long-term goal of this laboratory is to understand how the brain uses past information, gathered over seconds to hours, to make sense of a stream of incoming information. Previous work from the laboratory shows that many areas of cortex can accumulate information over time and use it for online processing. Furthermore, this research showed that early sensory areas use past information gathered over milliseconds, and this timescale increases to minutes in higher-order brain areas. These findings suggest that memories needed for online stimulus processing are topographically distributed in a hierarchy across the cortex based on their temporal properties. The overall objective of this application is to investigate the functional role of cortical areas at the top of the processing hierarchy; in particular, we will investigate to what extent these cortical areas have an intrinsic ability to accumulate information over minutes, and to what extent these long-timescale properties emerge from interactions with the hippocampus. This contribution is significant because the proposed research will provide new insights into a central function of the brain: the ability to accumulate information over minutes and use it to process an incoming information stream. This approach is innovative because it uses new experimental paradigms, both fMRI and ECoG methods, both neurotypical and brain lesioned amnesic patients, and includes development of novel analysis methods for brain responses to complex natural stimuli (stories and movies). The work proposed in this application will advance knowledge of how the brain combines information across minutes and will produce new approaches to the study of how memory is dynamically used during online stimulus processing."
"9406367","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this training grant program is to prepare outstanding M.D, M.D-Ph.D. and Ph.D. trainees for careers as scientific leaders in HIV/AIDS research. Despite enormous progress over the last 3 decades towards reducing the morbidity and mortality from HIV/AIDS, substantial challenges remain. These include developing a safe and effective vaccine; development of a cure for HIV infection; improving the treatment and management of opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis that burden HIV-infected patients in resource- limited settings; managing the threat of antiretroviral drug resistance; and developing safe and effective interventions to reduce the inappropriate immune activation that accompanies HIV infection and leads to end- organ disease. Progress on these fronts requires basic and translational research to further our understanding of the molecular biology, pathogenesis, immunology, prevention and therapeutics of HIV/AIDS. Over the past 25 years this program has trained 84 post-doctoral fellows, the majority of whom have gone on to leadership positions in academia, industry and government. This program will provide in-depth laboratory experience in a specific research area of HIV-related virology, immunology, epidemiology, molecular genetics, molecular therapeutics, genomics and/or systems biology. Criteria for selecting trainees will include prior training record, aptitude for research and demonstrated commitment to a research career. All applicants will be selected by a Training Advisory Committee (TAC); 7 trainees will be selected annually. Particular emphasis will be given to the recruitment of minorities and others underrepresented in AIDS research, including women, individuals with disabilities and those from disadvantaged backgrounds. Basic elements of the program include: 1) in-depth research training through laboratory investigation of a specific scientific question in a particular area of AIDS research under mentorship of a senior investigator; 2) a didactic program consisting of appropriately chosen courses specific to the trainee's career goals; 3) frequent exposure to seminars, workshops and colloquia related to AIDS; regular review of progress by individual Research Advisory Committees and the TAC.

"9236469","Project Summary/Abstract Candidate ? Immediate and Long-Term Career Goals: Jung Yeon Lee, Ph.D., has a strong background in statistics and behavioral science, as well as basic and translational research. Her overarching career goal is to become an independent academic research scientist working at the interface between substance use, psychopathology, cultural factors, intervention research, and statistics. To achieve this long term goal, Dr. Lee plans to extend her research area into the social sciences through a plan for acquiring epidemiological expertise, and developing innovative statistical techniques to deal with large longitudinal datasets. Environment ? Key Elements of the Research Career Development Plan: Dr. Lee is currently a junior research member in the Department of Psychiatry at New York University School of Medicine. Under the guidance of her mentoring team (Drs. J.S. Brook, S.J. Finch, D.W. Brook), collaborators (Drs. M. Galanter, J. Endicott, K. Pahl, E. Obasi, M.

Relevance: The findings will lead to a greater understanding of the relationships between triple comorbid trajectories of substance use and 1) psychological functioning in adolescence as predictors and 2) in adulthood as consequences. The results will also lead to further knowledge of the risk and protective factors of substance use. These findings would contribute to innovative prevention and treatment programs."
"9254607","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project is a research collaboration between the University of Texas at El Paso, The Alliance for Border Collaborative and Program Comparers to adapt, implement, and evaluate a multi-level, community-based, HIV prevention intervention (Project Encuentro). The intervention will target active heroin and crack users and consists of increasing access to HIV testing via a social network HIV testing component and reducing sexual and drug use risk via a peer network brief behavioral Intervention. Encuentro also consists of conducting community awareness meeting to target structural factors affecting HIV risk. The intervention was developed in an area severely affected by violence and stigma towards drug users, El Salvador, which makes it particularly suitable for adaptation to meet the needs of drug users living in the proposed intervention site, the U.S.-Mexico border. The proposed intervention site also has been severely affected by violence which has curtailed any prior attempts to reduce the risk drug users' HIV risk. Violence has worsened structural factors which affect HIV risk such as, increasing police persecution and stigma and reducing access to resources. In our proposed project, we will engage in formative research to understand the context of HIV risk of drug users in the border region post violence and adapt the intervention accordingly. Findings will allow us to tailor intervention components to meet the needs of drug users in the region. Subsequently, we propose to test intervention effectiveness and evaluate implementation barriers and facilitators. To accomplish our project aims we will use a mixed qualitative, quantitative approach. We will begin with a formative phase by conducting in-depth interviews with drug users (n = 40) living in the region to understand how the context of drug use risk changed as a result of the violence and will administer a social network survey (n = 200) to characterize the configuration of risk networks. Findings will yield the necessary information to culturally adapt the intervention to meet the needs of drug users in the region and will help us focus our recruitment efforts where the riskiest networks are located. After the intervention is adapted with the help of our community advisory board and our community coalition, we will implement the intervention and will assess the effectiveness and reach via 6 cross-sectional surveys administered to drug users (n=1,200). We will assess the process of implementation by conducting ethnographic field notes of all intervention activities including community engagement and CAB and coalition meetings. We will assess the fidelity and quality of the intervention. Lastly, we will conduct key informant interviews with key stakeholders involved in the project and interviews and observations will be coded to reflect key systems factors related to successful implementation of intervention components in two intervention sites (El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico). Findings will be highly significant as we will be conducting parallel research on the effectiveness of interventions shown to be effective in Latino drug users in two very different contexts: El Salvador and the U.S-Mexico border. Findings will elucidate implementation challenges and barriers and such information can then be used to assess the effectiveness of diverse implementation strategies in organizations working to serve the needs of Latino drug users."
"9411952","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this renewal application is to extend this investigation of intergenerational continuity and discontinuity in drug use in a three-generation (G1, G2, G3) prospective design, using data from the Rochester Youth Development Study (RYDS) and the Rochester Intergenerational Study (RIGS). Drug use is a serious and persistent health problem in American society with a host of negative consequences including increased risk for HIV/AIDS, cognitive impairment, and premature mortality. Four aims are addressed to better understand its origins: 1) describe intergenerational continuity and discontinuity across three generations for drug use and related problem behaviors, at both the same and different developmental stages; 2) identify mediating and moderating processes that help account for both intergenerational continuity and discontinuity in drug use; 3) examine the long-term precursors of the onset and maintenance of G3 drug use through the peak years of use; and 4) examine the intergenerational influence of G2 fathers as well as G2 mothers. The focal participant is the oldest biological child (G3) of the original participant in the RYDS study The project proposed here capitalizes on the rich developmental data collected since 1988 on the G2 parents and G1 grandparents; combining those data with the prospective data collected in the current study provides a rare opportunity to examine how the parent's own developmental course influences their transition to adulthood and their behavior as parents which, in turn, can be used to explain the onset and development of the G3 child's drug use. In Year 1 (1999), 370 G3 children (age 2 and older) and their parents were enrolled; new 2-year-olds are added each year. By Year 21, the last assessment proposed, a total of 546 G3 families will have enrolled in the study-99% of the sampling goal of all oldest biological G3 children. Annually, interviews are conducted with the G2 parent, the G3 child (age 8 and older), and, in the G2 father families, the child's bio-mother (or another primary caregiver). Measures include the parent's structural position and stressors, drug use and problem behaviors, prosocial bonds, peer networks, family context, and parenting behaviors. G3 assessments include their general psychosocial development, with detailed information on the onset and course of their drug use, other problem behaviors, and prosocial competencies. The extension of data collection through Year 21 that is proposed here is particularly crucial to realize the full potential of the project because it is duing these years that 1) the vast majority of the G3 children will move through adolescence and into early adulthood when drug use reaches its peak, 2) G3 overlaps in age with the G2 parents when they were assessed in the original study, and 3) the prevalence and frequency of G3 drug use are high enough to support detailed analyses of the aims. The findings will yield crucial insights into the onset and course of G3 drug use that have the potential to generate early and novel approaches to drug use prevention."
"9330388","The role of Lung Surfactant (LS) in lowering the surface tension, ?, at the alveolar air-liquid interface is well known. We hypothesize that a second essential function of LS is to prevent the Laplace instability, which drives gas out of smaller alveoli and into larger ones, leading to alveolar de-recruitment, atelectasis and loss of lung compliance. These are the core symptoms of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), which afflicts 150,000 people in the US with a 40% mortality rate. We hypothesize that the dynamic resistance of the LS monolayer to changes in area can reverse the Laplace instability. The dilatational modulus, ? = ? ?? ?? , relates the change in surface tension, ?, to the change in interfacial area, A. For 2??? >0, the Laplace pressure decreases with decreasing radius, suppressing the Laplace Instability. However, if 2??? < 0, variations in lung inflation drive collapse of smaller alveoli, leading to the alveolar flooding and decreased lung compliance.  Our preliminary work shows that serum proteins and lysolipids, which increase in the alveolar fluids during ARDS-induced inflammation, increase ? by competitively adsorbing to the alveolar interface. These inhibitors also dramatically decrease the dilatational modulus due to their diffusional exchange with the subphase, especially at low interfacial area strain rates (?A(t)/A). Such conditions arise in damaged areas of the lung with poor gas exchange and high levels of inflammation products and provoke the Laplace instability as 2??? < 0. This leads to further damage in injured areas of the lung and a negative feedback loop is established that may be responsible for the ineffectiveness of current ARDS treatments.  To address this hypothesis, we have built a novel capillary pressure microtensiometer to measure ?(?) of LS, serum proteins, and lysolipids for the first time. We will map out ?(?) for clinical and model lung surfactants as a function of surfactant composition, morphology, surface pressure and frequency to determine the effects of saturated vs. unsaturated lipid fraction, domain morphology, and lung surfactant proteins SP-B and SP-C, cholesterol and fatty acid fractions. We will examine how ?(?) changes due to subphase compositions of lysolipids, albumin, and fibrinogen, all of which have elevated levels in the ARDS lung. These first of their kind measurements should provide us with a map of the conditions under which the Laplace instability plays a role in the progression of ARDS. Reversing the Laplace instability requires understanding how to prevent inhibitors from reaching the alveolar interface, or removing inhibitors that do adsorb. From our new understanding of ?(?) we will create LS formulations with optimized rheological properties to promote LS respreading. We also propose that minimizing the anionic lipid fraction in LS and adding low concentrations of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and trivalent cations from adjuvants such as alum, will provide an electrostatic and osmotic assist to promote LS adsorption. Minimizing the inhibitor concentration and maximizing LS would lower ?, increase ?(?) and reverse the conditions leading to the Laplace instability, thereby restoring proper lung function."
"9258954","PROJECT SUMMARY Predicting the success of combination cancer immunotherapy is a major challenge due to the multiscale complex- ity of the immune response to the cancer and the therapy. For example, the pharmaceutical activation of the T cell coreceptors OX40 (CD134) and 4-1BB (CD137) has been shown to synergistically decrease T cell apoptosis rates and increase their rate of cytokine secretion, creating 'supereffector' T cells that can potently kill tumors in vivo, but it is not currently known whether the synergy occurs at the intracellular level or at the level of cell-cell interactions. Therefore, development of optimized clinical treatment protocols for use of these coreceptor agonists for cancer immunotherapy can only be done on a trial-and-error basis. In recent years, mathematical and computational modeling has emerged as a tool to organize current knowledge of the immune response into a dynamic system that can aide in predicting tumor-immune development and identify emergent properties of complex, multiscale interactions between different cell types. Additionally, the emergence of high-throughput methods to assay cel- lular and organismal response to therapy offers promise to elucidate molecular response mechanisms, but the data must still be incorporated into a predictive framework. The global research objective of the proposed project is to develop intracellular and multiscale mathematical and computational models of T cell coreceptor activation that use information from high-throughput technologies and can serve to explain how dual coreceptor activation can generate supereffector T cells. The central hypothesis is that mathematical and computational modeling will be effective in deciphering the critical mechanisms and scales underlying synergistic behavior of T cell agonists. The models will be built by pursuing the following two specific aims: (1) Develop dynamic mathematical models of OX40 and 4-1BB network-level activation for CD8, CD4, and Treg cells, and (2) Develop a multiscale agent- based model of T cell activation by OX40 and 4-1BB. In the first aim, the intracellular models will be built within a discrete dynamic framework, using data from the existing literature and high-throughput methods such as ChIP- seq. In the second aim, the population-level model will be developed using an agent-based approach by coupling intracellular-level dynamics of individual cells and cell types with intercellular interactions rules of heterogeneous T cell types. The proposed project is innovative, in the applicant's opinion, as it will generate a novel mathematical and computational platform to examine multiscale drug synergism. The models will make a significant contribution to cancer immunology as they will allow for both a better understanding of how dual costimulated T cells contribute to the tumor-immune response, and provide a platform to optimize therapy development."

The current training places increased emphasis on understanding issues of importance for translational and effectiveness research and builds on new relationships with the Institute for Clinical and Translational Research and the Center for Mental Health Services in Pediatric Primary Care. Fellows learn to apply theories and cutting- edge research methodologies to address prevention, treatment, and support of recovery for mental disorders occurring in children and, youth, and support for parents and caregivers of children and youth with or at high risk for mental disorders. A particular emphasis is in reducing health disparities and improving the health in populations and in developing and testing more efficient and cost effective research designs.  Predoctoral and postdoctoral fellows participate in a core seminar and series of related research activities. While working from an individualized training plan, postdoctoral fellows also take courses to increase their analytic capacities. They conduct research with the supervision of two mentors, one from outside their home department, and are expected to submit papers for publication and presentation at national conferences, and complete a grant application.  During our current five year cycle, we have increased research on pre-school and school- based interventions and interventions with youth involved in employment development activities. Over the next five years we propose to extend these research activities and link with the efforts of the recently NIMH-funded Center for Mental Health Services in Pediatric Primary Care. A new focus of the program is training on research aimed at identifying sustainable ways to increase primary care providers' capacity to improve functioning, reduce distress, and prevent disability among children with emotional and behavioral disturbances and their families. Fellows are presented with a diverse set of potential training sites and collaborations because of the number and diversity of research projects being conducted by affiliated faculty."
"9414187","The unprecedented 2014?2015 Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak in West Africa has highlighted the urgent, unfulfilled need for vaccines and therapeutics to prevent and treat infections by EBOV and other filoviruses. However, their development is challenged by crucial gaps in our understanding of the virus-host molecular interactions that underpin filovirus infection, disease, and transmission. Recent work on the entry mechanism of filoviruses has revealed that these agents are prototypic members of a group of `late-penetrating' viruses that extensively exploit host endo/lysosomal factors and pathways to invade cells. During the previous grant period, we found that host endosomal cysteine proteases (cysteine cathepsins) program the viral glycoprotein GP to bind the endosomal cholesterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), which we showed to be an essential intracellular entry receptor. Despite these and other discoveries, however, the culminating steps in filovirus entry?GP-mediated fusion between viral and cellular lipid bilayers, and cytoplasmic escape of the viral nucleocapsid core?remain enigmatic. The overarching goals of this renewal application are to define the molecular mechanism of filovirus membrane fusion, and to identify new filovirus entry host factors with antiviral potential. To fulfill these objectives, the PI has assembled a multidisciplinary team that includes a field leader in the chemical biology of proteases, a leading expert on the biogenesis and functions of endosomes and lysosomes, and a virologist who will extend findings with surrogate viruses to authentic filoviruses. Together we will: (1) Define viral and cellular requirements for filovirus membrane fusion, dissect steps in the fusion reaction, and identify the elusive filovirus fusion trigger factor(s). (2) Determine the roles of newly- identified host factors in viral trafficking to membrane fusion sites, and employ proteomic approaches to uncover novel host factors involved in filovirus membrane fusion."
"9333513","Abstract Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a human pathogen that causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. An increasing number of tuberculosis cases are caused by multi-drug and extreme-drug resistant Mtb strains, underscoring the need for novel therapeutics. Mtb manipulates infected cells in order to achieve virulence and to this end Mtb needs to secrete proteins, which will interact with the host cell. The first type 7 secretion system (T7SS) was originally identified in mycobacteria and since then four additional systems have been described (ESX-1 through ESX-5). A core, four-gene sequence of the ESX-5 system has been duplicated three times in the Mtb genome (ESX-5a, ESX-5b and ESX-5c). Here we propose the novel hypothesis that the duplicated ESX-5 regions have an accessory function in the secretion of specific subgroups of ESX-5-secreted proteins. In AIM1 we plan to generate Mtb deletion mutants in order to determine the impact of the deletion of the ESX-5 accessory systems on host cell responses and virulence. In AIM2 we will use proteomics approaches to characterize the secretomes associate with the ESX-5 accessory systems. These studies will lay the groundwork to enable the identification of specific, ESX-5-secreted, effector proteins critical for Mtb virulence. The proposed research will thus ultimately aid in the design of better recombinant vaccines strains and/or the generation novel targets for drug development."
"9220664","Center PI: Malenka, Robert, Principal Investigator: Chen, Lu (Mouse Core)  Summary  The goal of the four Conte Center research projects is to explore novel molecular mechanisms underlying  hippocampal synaptic plasticity and how these contribute to memory formation during behavioral learning. To  facilitate this endeavor, the Conte Center Mouse Core is organized to achieve two aims. First, through the  efforts of a full time technician working closely with experienced PI's and postdocs, it will provide a centralized  service of mouse colony maintenance, distribution and genotyping for the needs of all four Conte Center  projects. This will involve breeding and distributing the mice required for all projects; focusing on the many  different lines of conditional knockout mice that will be used by individual projects to test specific hypotheses  about the molecular mechanisms underlying LTP and homeostatic synaptic plasticity as well as a smaller  number of Cre driver lines that will also be essential. Second, the Mouse Core will provide service and training  to Conte Center scientists for all the procedures that are required for stereotactic injection of viruses in  newborn and adult mice. Establishing standardized procedures for virus generation, handling, and injection in  live animals as well as post-op care will greatly enhance biosafety and improve experimental efficiency. By  providing these two essential services, the Mouse Core will reduce duplicate efforts among research teams  and enhance the efficiency of standard procedures, thereby greatly facilitating the progress of the individual  research projects and the Conte Center as a whole.

"9317191","ABSTRACT The interstitial concentration of adenosine remains elevated following MI continuing well after the injured tissue has healed and a scar has formed. However, the impact of adenosine signaling during post-MI remodeling and chronic ischemic heart failure remains unknown. In other organs, the novel concept has emerged that adenosine becomes damaging if it remains persistently elevated in tissues by activating pathways that promote fibrosis. This has been observed in experimental animal models of chronic lung, liver, kidney, and skin diseas- es. While the mechanisms by which adenosine becomes damaging vary, it generally acts to promote exces- sive tissue repair via activation of the A2BAR. The A2BAR is a unique member of the AR family abundantly ex- pressed in macrophages linked to cellular activation and production of inflammatory/fibrogenic cytokines. To determine the contribution of adenosine signaling during post-MI remodeling, we examined the effect of genet- ic deletion or blockade of the A2BAR (ATL-801) in a mouse model of permanent coronary artery ligation. Our preliminary data show a marked reduction in fibrosis with loss of A2BAR signaling at 8 weeks post-MI, which was associated with reduced inflammatory/fibrogenic activity in heart tissue, less dysfunction, and improved compliance. Central hypothesis: Augmented production of adenosine persists following MI, which contributes to fibrosis, pathological remodeling, and heart failure via activation of the A2BAR subtype. Aim #1 will define the role of A2BAR signaling during post-MI remodeling. We will test whether genetic deletion or inhibition of the A2BAR will slow the rate of fibrosis that develops in surviving myocardium following MI resulting in less dysfunc- tion and ultimately prolonged survival. This aim will be accomplished using ATL-801, Adora2b-/- mice, as well as a new line of Adora2b mutant rats created by our lab. Aim #2: To delineate the mechanisms by which A2BAR signaling contributes to adverse post-MI remodeling. Utilizing a conditionally targeted mouse line lack- ing expression of the A2BAR in myeloid-derived cells, assessments of macrophage infiltration/activation, and molecular analyses of post-MI heart tissue, we will test the hypothesis that persistent exposure to adenosine following MI stimulates the production of inflammatory mediators from macrophages that causes chronic in- flammation, fibroblast activation, and fibrosis. Aim #3: To delineate the magnitude and consequences of en- hanced adenosine production during post-MI remodeling and ischemic heart failure. We will assess changes in the interstitial concentration of adenosine in the surviving myocardium during the course of post-MI remodel- ing. We hypothesize that the interstitial concentration of adenosine will increase progressively during late re- modeling as the heart fails and that its enzymatic removal with pegylated-adenosine deaminase therapy will be protective. Completion of this work is expected to identify adenosine as an important fibrogenic mediator in the heart that contributes to pathological remodeling following MI through its interaction with the A2BAR subtype, and potentially identify a novel target for therapeutic intervention for patients with ischemic heart disease."
"9397850","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek a five-year renewal of our training grant on emotion research. Our training program continues to focus on three specific themes: 1. Personality, temperament and individual differences: Lifespan developmental, genetic, cognitive and biological approaches; 2. Affective neuroscience; and 3. Emotion and psychopathology. In this renewal, we request funds for 6 pre-doctoral and 3 post-doctoral stipends/year. This number is mandated by NIMH program staff for budgetary reasons. Since the time of the last competitive renewal, we have added several additional faculty with research interests centrally in emotion, we have strengthened our new brain imaging facility-the Waisman Center Laboratory for Brain Imaging and Behavior-that is focused principally on affective neuroscience; we have founded the innovative Center for Investigating Healthy Minds, which focuses on contemplative neuroscience and its impact on positive affect; we have produced novel new data and research strategies in our NIMH-sponsored Conte Adolescence Center;; and we have begun several major collaborative projects focused on emotion in aging, emotion in autism, various areas of affective neuroscience and affective development. We have 19 program faculty, drawn from three academic units, with Psychology as the lead department. Pre-doctoral trainees will be supported for two years and post-doctoral trainees will be offered up to three years of support but will be encouraged to write their own post-doctoral training proposals during their initial year in the program to held leverage the funds we request from this T32. Major elements of the training program include: four 8-week course modules devoted to different aspects of emotion theory and research, focusing primarily on the three themes upon which the program is based, with Davidson and Goldsmith each teaching one module and other program faculty teaching the others on a rotating basis; a Spring seminar each year associated with the Wisconsin Symposium on Emotion, an annual event at Wisconsin that brings 5-6 outside speakers to campus for a meeting on a specific topic in emotion research; participation in a seminar series devoted to ethical issues in research; participation in periodic meetings of our NIMH-funded Conte Center that focus on the neural bases of individual differences in emotion regulation in adolescents; and participation in monthly emotion groups held at different faculty members' homes each month. We believe this program is unique and provides an extraordinary opportunity for interdisciplinary training in emotion research"
"9201316","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prohibitin 1 (PHB1) is a highly conserved, ubiquitously expressed protein that participates in diverse processes including mitochondrial chaperone, growth and apoptosis. The role of PHB1 in vivo is unclear as embryonic deletion is lethal. We reported that mice lacking methionine adenosyltransferase 1A (MAT1A) have reduced PHB1 expression at the protein level, impaired mitochondrial function, and spontaneously develop steatohepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To see if reduced PHB1 expression can contribute to the Mat1a knockout (KO) phenotype, we generated liver-specific Phb1 KO mice. At 3 weeks, liver-specific Phb1 KO mice exhibit biochemical and histologic liver injury. Immunohistochemistry revealed oxidative stress, fibrosis, hepatocyte dysplasia, and increased staining of preneoplastic markers. Mitochondrial function is impaired. Phb1 KO mice are sensitized to multiple forms of liver injury but the key mechanism appears to be independent of its role as a mitochondrial chaperone. Our preliminary data show PHB1 deficiency leads to higher total and nuclear histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) expression and activity. Interestingly, inhibiting HDAC activity prevented increased cell death in Phb1 KO hepatocytes induced by a variety of toxicants. We also found PHB1 protein level falls in cholestatic liver injury in mouse and humans, suggesting this could further perpetuate liver damage. Many Phb1 KO mice develop multifocal HCC by 35 weeks. Our preliminary data also support PHB1 can directly influence genes implicated in hepatocarcinogenesis. Two genes highly up-regulated in 4-week-old male KO mice livers are H19 and insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2). Acute knockdown of PHB1 in murine non-transformed AML12 cells raised cyclin D1, H19 and IGF2 expression, increased E2F binding to the cyclin D1 promoter, and proliferation. The opposite occurred with PHB1 overexpression. These results support PHB1 as a tumor suppressor in hepatocytes. The current application is to examine these highly novel areas and define the role of PHB1 in liver injury and HCC. Three specific aims are proposed: 1) examine the role of PHB1 in liver injury, 2) examine how PHB1 influences HCC development, and 3) determine if PHB1 down-regulation contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction, liver injury and HCC formation in the Mat1a KO mice. Our main hypotheses are 1) PHB1 protein stability falls during cholestatic liver injury and this is part of the mechanism of injury, 2) PHB1 regulates hepatocyte death via HDAC-mediated epigenetic changes, 3) PHB1 regulates HDAC4, H19 and IGF2 expression directly and their induction contribute to HCC formation in the liver-specific Phb1 KO mice, and 4) decreased PHB1 expression contributes to impaired mitochondrial function and HCC formation in the Mat1a KO mice. The application is hypothesis-driven and mechanistic and represents a new area of investigation as little is known of the biological functions of PHB in the liver. The ultimate goal is to translate results from the laboratory to bedside to optimize PHB1 function, which is essential to prevent liver injury and HCC, topics that are highly relevant to public health."
"9307448","7. Project Summary/Abstract Deficiencies in complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain represent an important class of human mitochondrial diseases that include Leigh Syndrome, Leber?s hereditary optic nephropathy, neonatal lactic acidosis, cardiomyopathy, and encephalopathy. Leigh Syndrome is generally regarded as the most common mitochondrial disease of infancy and is characterized primarily by severe neurological defects. There is currently no effective treatment. A mouse model has been developed in which the complex I structural subunit NDUFS4 is knocked-out. Ndufs4-/- mice show a profound neurodegenerative phenotype including retarded growth rate, lethargy, loss of motor skill, blindness, weight loss, and early death. These symptoms are recapitulated in human patients with Ndufs4 mutations, as well as other Leigh Syndrome-associated mutations. We have recently reported that treating Ndufs4-/- mice with the drug rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), results in two to three-fold increase in survival, dramatic attenuation of neurologial defecits, and reduced neurodegeneration. In unpublished studies, we have observed similar effects from the NAD+ precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) -glucosidase inhibitor acarbose. The broader goals this proposal to define the mechanistic basis for suppression of mitochondrial disease by rapamycin, NMN, and acarbose in the Ndufs4 knockout (KO) mouse. This will be accomplished broadly by assessing changes in the metabolome and phosphoproteome, and specifically by determining the effects of these interventions on mitochondrial function, mTOR signaling, NAD homeostasis, and activity of the NAD-dependent mitochondrial SIRT3 deacetylase. We will test the specific hypothesis that these intervention act by enhancing SIRT3 activity by creating animals lacking both NDUFS4 and SIRT3 and determining whether this blocks or attenuates rescue of the disease. These studies promise to enhance our understanding of mitochondrial function in the context of complex I deficiency and facilitate the development of interventional strategies to improve the lives of patients with mitochondrial disease."
"9345748","Project Summary Occidiofungin is a cyclic nonribosomally synthesized antifungal peptide with submicromolar fungicidal activity against a broad spectrum of fungi. Occidiofungin is produced by the Gram- negative bacterium Burkholderia contaminans. From our structural characterization studies, occidiofungin was determined to have a unique chemical composition. Our studies have also revealed that occidiofungin has a novel mechanism of action. Occidiofungin is a potent antifungal against fluconazole and caspofungin-resistant Candida albicans. Occidiofungin triggers cell death by inducing apoptosis in yeast cells. Occidiofungin has minimal toxicity in mice dosed with 2 mg/kg in a 28 day toxicity study. Furthermore, occidiofungin was shown to reduce Candida glabrata load in the kidneys of infected mice. All these studies point to the need to further the preclinical development of this novel compound. A major need for furthering investigational studies on this unique antifungal compound is the identification of a lead molecule for preclinical testing. The goal of this application is to screen a library of natural and semi-synthetic analogs of occidiofungin for bioactivity testing. The compound that has the best properties will be used in the required preclinical tests that are compulsory before our initial meeting with the FDA. This work is necessary for furthering additional studies aimed at developing the antifungal compound as a new therapeutic."
"9386165","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As natural products (NP) sales increase, the risk of adverse NP-drug interactions (NPDIs) increases, yet the pharmacokinetic (PK) elucidation and clinical relevance of putative NPDIs remain elusive. Assessing the risk of NPDIs is more challenging than that of drug-drug interactions (DDIs), often due to relatively scant PK knowledge of individual NP constituents that perpetrate these interactions. The proposed U54 Center will develop a roadmap for NPDI research through a series of well-designed human in vitro and in vivo studies (termed Interaction Projects) on 4-6 priority NPs that pose a potential risk for clinically relevant NPDIs. A repository will be developed for the data generated from the Interaction Projects, and results will be communicated to various target audiences through a public portal. This U54 Center is composed of an accomplished team of investigators, including pharmacokineticists with expertise in NPDIs, complemented by expertise in NP chemistry, DDIs, and health information communication. In collaboration with the Steering Committee, an innovative strategy that combines a mechanistic approach with practical considerations (e.g., popularity of the NPs) will be used to select and prioritize 4-6 NPs for further investigation in te Interaction Projects. Mechanistic aspects include curated clinical NDPI data from the widely used Drug Interaction Database (DIDB) of the Informatics Core, structural alerts, and compelling preliminary clinical and in silico NPDI data. Once selected, the NPs will be entered into a Decision Tree for assessment of NPDI liability and probable significance of interactions with victim drugs. In parallel, the Pharmacology Core will develop detailed Statements of Work for the human in vitro and in vivo studies - while the Analytical Core will source, acquire, and characterize the selected NPs - for the Interaction Projects. Upon completion of each project, the Analytical Core will analyze the PK samples, and the Pharmacology Core will develop physiologically-based PK models for further assessment of the clinical relevance of the Interaction Project results. Throughout these projects, the Informatics Core will create a data repository embedded within a public portal web-based application named, NaPDI app, for Natural Product-Drug Interaction application. The repository, built using the DIDB framework, will allow researchers to access both raw data and summarized results. The U54 Center will also develop and share Best Practices recommended for the conduct of NPDI studies, based on the experience with and results from the Interaction Projects, with the research communities via the public portal. Effective dissemination of the Interaction Project results will be ensured through user experience and brand content studies with target audiences - researchers/practitioners and lay public - to refine the public portal content. The Informatics Core will ensure that the U54 Center's results are archived, organized, analyzed, and well-publicized, allowing for improved design of future NPDI research and ultimately, improved decisions on the optimal management of clinically relevant NPDIs."
"9240936","Project Summary/Abstract The proposed project addresses the following questions: 1) across different species and different models are there (from the transcriptional perspective) common neuroimmune mechanisms regulating excessive ethanol consumption; 2) do the ?common mechanisms? extend across brain regions; 3) are there differences between males and females in the transcriptional signatures; 4) are long non-coding RNAs relevant to our understanding of the neuroimmune hypothesis; 5) does gene splicing participate in the neuroimmune hypothesis; 6) from addressing 1-5, can we extract and validate specific targets for manipulating excessive consumption. To address these questions, three specific aims have been proposed. Specific Aim 1 will examine using RNA-Seq the transcriptonal features associated with the risk for developing and the individual variation in mouse lines selected for binge ethanol consumption. The aim will focus on the high drinking in the dark selected lines (HDID-1 & HDID-2; Crabbe et al. 2012); transcriptional data will be obtained both in ethanol naïve animals (risk) and in animals three weeks following the standard 4-day DID trial (individual variation). RNA-Seq data will be obtained from the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), the nucleus accumbens shell (NAc-sh) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Data are analyzed using a network centric approach that focuses on both gene coexpression and cosplicing (Iancu et al. 2015) and emphasizes the detection of hub genes. Specific Aim 2 will analyze in collaboration with INIA-Stress samples from rhesus macaques chronically exposed to ethanol. In ongoing studies we have examined the brain transcriptome in both rhesus and cynomolgus macaques chronically and continuously exposed to ethanol; the data strongly point to the involvement of neuroimmune genes. We now propose to extend this work to two new groups of animals. One group will have undergone chronic intermittent exposure (CIE) The second group will be formed from both male and female animals chronically (12 months) exposed to ethanol and controls. Specific Aim 3 will prioritize and validate targets generated from specific aims 1 and 2. The analysis strategy emphasizes detecting coexpressed or cospliced gene clusters that are closely aligned with excessive ethanol consumption. Neuroimmune-related clusters, especially those that cross species and models, will have the highest priority for further analysis; the very highest priority will go to those clusters for which it appears that the repurposing of existing drugs can be used to affect cluster structure (Mayfield/Farris/Ponomarev node). For some gene clusters, drug repurposing will not be the most efficient strategy for gene manipulation and it will be necessary to rely on gene knockouts & knockins (Homanics node) or vector based approaches (Lasek node). The actual behavioral testing will occur in the Crabbe/Ozburn, Blednov/Messing and Bell nodes. Finally, a special arm of this aim is to provide the Homanics node with lncRNA targets for evaluation. The goal is to find hub lncRNAs within relevant gene modules, focusing on those modules associated with neuroimmune function."
"9234518","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): First-line chemotherapy with doxorubicin (Dox) is the current standard of care for patients with advanced, symptomatic soft tissue sarcoma (STS), but dosage is limited by cardiotoxicity. This is particularly problematic in STS because there is evidence that tumor response rates correlate with dosage. Further, local control and/or limb salvage can be achieved using regional therapy (isolated limb infusion techniques, regional chemotherapy with radiation or preoperative systemic chemotherapy with local hyperthermia). These findings support the need for a local non-invasive Dox delivery platform with low systemic toxicity for treatment of STS. To address this unmet need, this proposal seeks to improve Dox delivery to STS and reduce cardiotoxicity by developing an image-guided targeted drug delivery platform utilizing liposomes, ultrasound contrast agents or microbubbles (MBs), and externally applied ultrasound (US).  We have recently developed a Dox-loaded delivery vehicle comprising liposomes containing Dox conjugated to polymer MBs, or Dox-loaded lipopolyplexes (DoxLPX), which can be i.v. injected. When circulating shell- encapsulated MBs are exposed to appropriately tuned US, they expand and contract, inducing micro-scale fluid dynamic phenomena and bio-effects --increased vascular and cellular permeability through sonoporation and induction of endocytosis-- that facilitate liposomal drug unloading, cellular drug delivery and uptake. Notably, navigation of the US beam confers both imaging of the treatment area as well as spatial targeting of the therapeutic effect, excluding non-target regions from drug release. We have demonstrated that specific US pulses release 70% of the loaded Dox from DoxLPX, preferentially delivers Dox to murine squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) in vivo with less cardiac accumulation compared to Dox alone, and inhibits SCC tumor growth, raising exciting possibilities for enhanced tumor-specific drug delivery and release.  We will test the overall hypothesis that i.v. injected MBs carrying Dox, combined with tumor directed US, improves local Dox accumulation, inhibits tumor growth and reduces drug-induced cardiomyopathy in a murine STS solid tumor model (orthotopic fibrosarcoma). Our Specific Aims are: Aim 1: To determine the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of Dox resulting from US delivery of DoxLPX. Aim 2: To determine the anti-tumor efficacy and cardiotoxicity of US-mediated DoxLPX delivery. Aim 3: To investigate the DoxLPX release mechanisms using ultra-high speed microscopy  Ultimately, this proposal will establish the foundations for a powerful theranostic platform for delivery of Do that combines the advantages of liposome encapsulation with a novel US-MB delivery strategy to augment liposomal Dox release specifically at the tumor site, while reducing off-target effects. Since liposomal Dox and MBs are mature technologies with precedent for FDA approval, we view strong potential of combining them for localized Dox delivery with fast-track to clinical translation, ultimately improving prognosis in patients with STS."

"9410649","Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease affecting -1,000,000 Americans. PD begins about the 6* decade with onset of bradykinesia, rigidity, and resting tremor. In addition, non-motor symptoms occur at any stage of PD, and >80% of PD patients develop dementia (PDD) with disease progression. Cognitive impairment (CI), executive dysfunction and dementia add to the burden of PD and increase mortality, but the underlying basis of dementia in PD is unclear, and there are no effective disease modifying therapies. Despite significant research advances, the exact causes of PD/PDD/DLB are unknown. To address these issues, a National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Morris K. Udall Parkinson's Disease Research Center of Excellence (Udall Center) was launched at the Perelman School of Medicine (Penn) of the University of Pennsylvania in 2007. The competing renewal for years 6-10 of the Penn Udall Center builds on its recent progress to elucidate the progression of PD from normal cognition to cognitive impairment (CI), executive dysfunction and dementia in PDD, as well as disease progression in DLB in addition to the central nervous system (CNS) degeneration mediated by progressive accumulations of pathological alpha-synuclein (a-syn). Because recent Penn Udall Center studies raise the provocative, but highly plausible possibility that the progression of PD/PDD/DLB is linked to the cell-to-cell spread of pathological a-syn, the overarching goals of the Penn Udall Center are to elucidate mechanisms of disease progression and a-syn transmission through synergistic collaborations between basic and translational research Projects that work with each of the Cores to implement the mission of the Penn Udall Center in the renewal period. To that end, the Udall Center renewal will implement the following Cores and Projects: Administrative Core A: Core Leaer (CL) - J.Q. Trojanowski; Clinical Core B: CL - H.

"9397630","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many diseases are caused not by outside pathogens, but by misregulation of proteins that otherwise maintain homeostasis or suppress disease. Successful treatments for human cancers rely on our ability to disrupt protein-protein interactions (PPIs) that drive tumorigenicity, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Unfortunately, several challenges make designing PPI inhibitors a difficult task. A major impediment is designing inhibitors that bind tightly and specifically to the target receptor.      Studies that define a binding motif for a protein domain are often limited by knowledge of only a few ligands. Additionally, it is common to study only those parts of ligands that form contacts observed in high-resolution x-ray studies. This proposal will comprehensively examine ligand sequence space both at the core interaction site and at peripheral regions that could interact with distal sites on the receptor surface, here termed exosites. This groundwork will then permit design of peptide inhibitors that not only optimize the known binding site, but seek to expand it to introduce tighter, more specific contacts. For this project, I have chosen to target TNF? Receptor Associated Factor 6 (TRAF6). TRAF6 participates in several cancer pathways, where it is either misregulated or overexpressed. My specific aims will: 1) characterize the binding preferences of TRAF6 in the ligand pocket, 2) test for exosite contacts within 8 residues of the binding sequence at either terminus, and 3) combine the knowledge gained to test optimized peptides for affinity and specificity for TRAF6 over other TRAF family members. Successful completion of this project will provide specific, high-affinity peptide PPI inhibitors against TRAF and a general workflow that could be applied to other peptide design projects, particularly those where the designable sites are limited by small interfaces."
"9237919","Project Summary The Cys2His2 zinc finger DNA-binding domain is the most common domain in human yet the DNA-binding specificities for the great majority of these proteins remain undefined. Mutations in many of these domains, both with and without known DNA-binding data, have been linked to a host of diseases from Alzheimers (REST) to Cancer (e.g. Slug, WT1, CTCF). Therefore, the characterization of these proteins holds great value. Unfortunately common methodologies used to determine the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors have failed to address the zinc finger, at least in part because of an inability to fully define the large target specificities required of the average mammalian zinc finger protein. Even when ChIP-Seq data exists it is limited because the size of the genome does not allow us to capture the full binding potential of a factor that could offer a ?21bp target sequence. As a result, without a comprehensive understanding of a protein?s binding potential, SNPs across the genome will continue to represent potential binding sites that we are unable to predict. In sum, decades of research have enlightened our understanding of this domain but we are still in the dark when it comes to its function as a transcription factors. Recently we have taken an alternative approach to define this domain, demonstrating that a synthetic, one-by-one screen of individual zinc fingers allows us to predict the specificity of multi-fingered proteins with similar or greater accuracy than all prior prediction algorithms. However, this approach fails to take into consideration the influences that adjacent fingers have on one another. We have produced the equivalent of a comprehensive snapshot of what a zinc finger is capable of in just one of many potential contextual environments. Here we propose to scale this approach and screen the zinc finger under an inclusive set of contextual environments. We will consider the most common direct and indirect influences on adjacent finger binding as well as factors that impact the geometry with which the zinc fingers engage the DNA. We will use these results to provide a complete picture of how adjacent zinc fingers determine their specificity and by scaffolding these two-fingered models, predict and design the specificity of large, multi-fingered proteins. In this way, we will define a multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity that allows us to predict all zinc finger DNA-binding specificities, how any neighbor finger context would modify this specificity, and the factors that result in adjacent finger incompatibility and loss of DNA-binding function. We will apply this model to predict the specificity of all human zinc finger proteins, validate these predictions through in vivo characterization of an informed set of transcription factors, and test predicted mechanisms of multi-fingered binding with designer, artificial factors."
"9212091","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amylin is a gut-brain axis hormone, which readily crosses the blood brain barrier (BBB) and mediates activities including regulating glucose metabolism, relaxing cerebrovascular structure and modulating inflammation, all of which could be beneficial for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies have shown that mild cognitive impairment (amnestic MCI) and AD patients have a lower concentration of amylin in plasma than the elderly who had normal cognition. In cross-sectional analyses, higher concentrations of plasma amylin are related to better cognitive function, especially in memory and executive domains. Using AD mouse models, our recent study demonstrates that intraperitoneal injection (i.p) of amylin improves learning and memory as well as reduces indices of AD pathology in the brain. Although these studies suggest that exogenous administration of amylin type peptides may be beneficial for AD, amylin can also form amyloid in the pancreas of type 2 diabetes and in the cerebrovasculature of AD brain that may lead to worsened cognition. Thus, it is important and critical to study the longitudinal relationship between the baseline concentration of plasma amylin and cognitive decline during aging process. From the Framingham Heart Study Offspring and Omni Generation 1 cohorts, we propose using plasma samples collected from 1995- 1998 to relate to incident change in cognition and brain structure up to 15 years later. We posit that high levels of plasma amylin are protective for cognitive decline and brain atrophy in aging process. We have five specific aims including 1) studying the distribution of plasma amylin in FHS community based population; 2) determining the relationship between baseline plasma amylin and cognitive changes, including incident mild cognitive impairment and dementia; 3) examining the association between plasma amylin and changes in brain morphology; 4) stratifying these analyses by the presence of ApoE4 allele, diabetes and other vascular diseases and 5) studying the relationship between amylin, A?, lipids, other gut-brain axis peptides and inflammation in FHS. Pramlintide is an amylin analog and an FDA approved drug for diabetes with a favorable safety profile in clinical use. Should we find that high levels of plasma amylin are protective for the incidence of AD, our study will provide additional rationale for a large phase 2 or 3 trial with pramlintide to determine if amylin type peptides can prevent and treat AD. We anticipate that this study may help open a new and unconventional avenue for the therapeutic of AD."
"9256881","Project Summary/Abstract Maladaptive forms of reward seeking that support drug abuse and obesity exact an enormous toll on individual and economic health. A mounting body of preclinical and clinical work demonstrates that the endocannabinoid system powerfully regulates the motivational impact of rewards. While pharmacotherapies targeting endocannabinoid function to treat disordered reward seeking are efficacious, this approach has been hindered due to non-specific drug actions and unacceptable side effects. Here, I aim to identify mechanisms by which endocannabinoids regulate reward seeking through interactions with dopamine system function to identify precise neuronal targets for future cannabinoid-based therapies. I will test the hypothesis that synthesis of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol by dopamine neurons is required for dopamine neurons to encode the incentive value of reward-predicting cues and motivate reward seeking. This work will employ two cutting-edge techniques, fast-scan cyclic voltammetry and optogenetics, paired with conditional and inducible mutagenesis to selectively target the enzyme responsible for 2-arachidonoylglycerol synthesis within dopamine neurons. Our ability to target dopamine neuron function in real-time during behavior and manipulate specific elements of the endocannabinoid system will provide novel information concerning how endocannabinoid signaling motivates reward seeking, potentially enabling the development of more targeted pharmacotherapies."
"9302179","In Africa, where Anopheles gambiae is the primary vector, the intensity of transmission and the spread of resistance in parasite and vector populations pose major challenges to malaria control. New insecticides and novel vector control strategies complementary to existing ones are badly needed. Foundational genomic resources for novel vector-based strategies are newly available for An. gambiae. Together, they enable detailed population genomics and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) aimed at understanding the genetic basis of epidemiologically important traits. However, An. gambiae is highly polymorphic for chromosomal inversions. Failing to account for inversions can mislead population genetic and genome-wide association studies and obscure relationships between inversions and epidemiologically relevant traits. Yet despite rapid advances in genome technology, cytogenetic determination of inversion status is the only method currently available. Inversion status is not obvious from genome re-sequencing data, as alleles are mapped to their position on a reference genome and not to their actual physical locations. Unfortunately, cytogenetic analysis is impractical or even prohibitive. Addressing this gap, the central goal of this R01 is to develop and validate computational and molecular inversion genotyping approaches, enabling a modern assessment of the association between inversions and epidemiologically relevant traits. Toward this end, we propose three specific Aims: (1) Develop a computational karyotyping approach applicable to SNP genotype data. Our preliminary data for two inversions, based on existing Ag1000G sequences, indicates that there are SNPs that can serve as surrogate markers for alternative orientations. Using field-collected mosquitoes of known karyotype and with sequencing support from Ag1000G, we will validate these results on wider geographic samples and extend them to additional inversions. (2) Develop a molecular karyotyping approach applicable without sequencing. Using an existing battery of karyotyped samples, we will develop simple and rapid molecular assays that eliminate the need to PCR amplify across variable breakpoint regions, and are accessible to any lab. (3) Assess the association between karyotype and malariologically important parameters. Leveraging existing An. gambiae samples, we will apply our computational and molecular karyotyping methods to test for a relationship between karyotype, indoor resting behavior, and parasite rate. Together, these tools will empower efforts to map and monitor epidemiologically important traits in vector populations."
"9244867","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10), an autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia, is caused by a large expansion mutation of intronic ATTCT pentanucleotide repeat in the ATXN10 gene. Our studies have suggested that toxic RNA rather than altered function of the protein product of ATXN10 is the likely cause of SCA10. We showed that the untranslated RNA transcript of the expanded repeat is accumulated in intracellular foci and interacts with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K). Preliminary data from cell culture and transgenic mouse models suggested that expression of (AUUCU) 500 repeats causes deleterious downstream events similar to those seen in cells and a brain of SCA10 patient. Knockdown of hnRNP K recapitulates some of these events in cell culture. The goal of this application is to demonstrate that the sequestration of hnRNP K plays a key role in SCA10 pathogenesis and to determine the relative contribution of this mechanism to the entire pathogenicity in SCA10. Our central hypothesis is that the major pathogenic mechanism of SCA10 is an RNA gain-of-function that causes functional loss of hnRNP K. To examine this hypothesis we propose:  ? Aim 1: Demonstrate binding of the expanded AUUCU repeat RNA to hnRNP K. We will perform unbiased searches of interacting proteins by pull-down/mass spectroscopy studies and in-silico bioinformatics, followed by co-immunoprecipitation, electromobility shift assay and high-throughput crosslinking studies.  ? Aim 2: Obtain evidence that hnRNP K sequestration causes neuronal dysfunction and cell death. We will recapitulate downstream changes found in the SCA10 brain and SCA10 models, such as activation of apoptotic pathways and abnormal alternative splicing of a variety of transcripts, by knockdown of hnRNP K in wild-type mice and cell cultures including neural cells derived from induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells.  ? Aim 3: Determine the relative contribution of hnRNP K to the SCA10 pathogenicity by examining the degree of rescue achieved by over-expression of hnRNP K in cell culture and transgenic mouse models. These studies will firmly establish the pathogenic role of hnRNP K and provide a therapeutic target."
"9224405","ABSTRACT This Independent Scientist Award will significantly enhance my research capabilities, enabling me to become a leading quantitative investigator in the field of substance use disorders (SUDs). Specifically, it will allow me to increase my knowledge in the areas of SUD phenotypes, treatment and genetics. SUDs are clinically and etiologically heterogeneous and their classification has been difficult. This application reflects my ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of SUDs through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data. My extensive training in computational science and prior research on biomedical informatics have provided me with the skills to design, implement and evaluate advanced algorithms and sophisticated analyses to solve challenging problems in classifying SUDs. My ongoing NIDA-funded R01 employs a large (n=~12,000) sample aggregated from multiple genetic studies of cocaine, opioid, and alcohol dependence to develop and evaluate novel statistical models to generate clinical SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. This K02 proposal extends that work to evaluate treatment outcome in refined subgroups of SUD populations using data from treatment studies for cocaine, opioid, alcohol and multiple substance dependence. This project will integrate data from diagnostic behavioral variables and genotypes, as well as biological/neurobiological features of the disorders and repeated measures of treatment outcome. The primary career development goals of this application are to: (1) understand the reliability, validity and functional mechanisms of various phenotyping methods; (2) to continue training in the genetics of addictions; and (3) to gain greater knowledge of different treatment approaches and their efficacy. A solid foundation in these areas will enhance my ability to realize the full potential of the data collected and aggregated from multiple dimensions, and to use the data to design the most clinically useful analysis and generate innovative solutions to diagnostic and predictive challenges in SUD research. Through formal coursework, directed readings, individual tutoring and intensive multidisciplinary collaboration with a diverse team of world-renowned researchers, I will receive training and collect pilot data for future R01 projects by examining (Aim I): whether clinically-defined highly heritable subtypes derived in my current R01 project predict differential treatment response; (Aim II) whether new statistical models that directly combine treatment data with behavioral, biological, and genomic data identify refined subtypes with confirmatory multilevel evidence; and (Aim III) whether there are genetic and social moderators of treatment outcome by subtype. The overall goal of this proposal is to further my independent and multidisciplinary research program in the development of statistical methods for refined classification of SUDs. The K02 award will provide me with the protected time necessary to fully engage in the training activities described that will enhance my knowledge and skills to enable me to make important, novel contributions to the genetics and treatment of SUD."
"9298176","Project Summary/Abstract The first step of a successful viral infection is virus attachment to a cell-surface receptor. The recent discovery that histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) may be potential rotavirus (RV) receptors has significantly improved our understanding of RV epidemiology, disease burden, and pathogenesis. However, RVs exhibit significant diversity and are capable of causing disease in many different populations and animal species, making it difficult to develop broadly effective vaccines against RVs. As examples, the P[6] and P[11] RVs recognize HBGA precursors or intermediate products and revealed unique age-specific host ranges in neonates and young infants, further complicating strategies for safe and effective vaccine delivery. In addition, both P[6] and P[11] RVs are commonly found in developing countries, likely due to a human genetic predisposition for unique HBGA types (Lewis negative) and zoonotic transmission of these two genotypes in rural areas, and may require a cocktail vaccine including P[6] and/or P[11] RVs to confer broad protection to children. In this application, we will perform field surveillance of RV infection in South African children to better understand the high prevalence of P[6] RVs, among other circulating genotypes, and guide improvement of current RV vaccines and/or development of new vaccines against RVs. Two aims will be fulfilled: First, we will evaluate circulating RV strains and their HBGA binding patterns in children to verify the HBGA-specific host ranges of major circulating RV P types in African children. A two-year surveillance of RV gastroenteritis in neonates and young infants will be performed at two sentinel sites. Special attention will be paid to the roles of specific HBGAs, such as the type 1 chain precursors, during P[6] RV infection in children. We will also assess the antigenic relatedness among major circulating human RVs and compare them to the current RV vaccine strains to identify additional potential targets for future vaccines. Second, we will study the age-specific tropism of P[6] and P[11] RVs in neonates and young infants. The age-windows for infection with specific RV P types will be determined through the RV surveillance in Aim 1. A cohort with monthly saliva samples from neonates and young infants from birth to one year of age will be collected to define the age-windows of expression for specific HBGA receptors that bind P[6] and P[11] RVs. Knowledge gained through these studies is valuable to design a vaccination program for safe and effective delivery of these vaccine strains. Finally, to advance the next generation of RV vaccines, we will study the biological properties and usefulness of a live, attenuated P[6] RV, developed in our group, as a potential candidate in a new cocktail vaccine against RVs."
"9210093","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical consequences of carotid artery (CA) plaque rupture include transient ischemic attacks and ischemic stroke. Carotid endarterectomy (CEA), an open surgical procedure, is the standard intervention in patients with advanced CA atherosclerosis. Patient-specific biomechanical analysis can aid in risk stratification of patients with known CA atherosclerosis, to identify those asymptomatic patients at higher risk of stroke who could benefit from more aggressive medical and/or surgical treatment. However, a shortage of material property data limits clinical application of recent advances in patient-specific biomechanical simulations, particularly material properties specific to clinically well-defined patient subsets.  Despite evidence that women with moderate, symptomatic carotid artery stenosis (CAS) derive less benefit from CEA than men in terms of event-free survival after surgery, gender-specific differences in material properties of human CA plaques have not been measured. In addition, to move patient-specific biomechanical analysis forward as a predictive clinical tool, quantitative measurements of changes in fibrous cap strength with time in response to cyclical loading (material fatigue behavior) are essential. Using CEA specimens and clinical imaging data (duplex ultrasound and CTA), we propose to examine gender differences in fibrous cap material properties and the effect of material fatigue on these properties over time. We propose the following Specific Aims: 1) To measure rupture resistance of fibrous caps in male vs. female CEA specimens, and to determine whether gender independently associates with rupture resistance; and 2) To measure the material fatigue behavior of fibrous cap specimens classified by gender and age, and to determine how biophysical properties of carotid plaque fibrous caps evolve with time due to material fatigue, as quantified by maximum circumferential stress and number of loading cycles. Resistance to rupture will be measured as ultimate tensile strength, fracture toughness, and fibrous cap adhesion strength.  We expect data from this pilot study to support future, patient-specific computational simulations and accelerate development of improved risk stratification algorithms for patients with moderate, asymptomatic CAS, by identifying gender-specific mechanical stress thresholds to define high risk plaques in males and females. We also expect that quantitation of fibrous cap material fatigue behavior will enable us to introduce time-dependence into the predictive algorithm for plaque failure. These efforts will contribute to the growing trend in precision medicine, using patient-specific data for improved risk stratification and selection of individualized treatment plans."

"9428406","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early intervention to identify and treat chronic disease and modify behavioral risk factors among women of reproductive age has the potential to significantly reduce their morbidity and mortality and improve their pregnancy outcomes. Lack of health insurance has been a major barrier to early intervention and preventive care among low-income women of reproductive age. However, the 2014 expansion of Medicaid under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) will make millions of low-income women newly eligible for Medicaid and preventive health services. An integrated data system is essential to evaluate the impact of this expansion on the health of women of reproductive age and their infants. Research using this data system will inform future program planning and identify best practices and areas of greatest need. We propose to create an integrated data system that links Oregon Medicaid data with birth and death certificates and hospital discharge data. Further, we will include data on the quality of Medicaid services that are not available to other states. The proposed study is a collaborative effort between Oregon State University and the Oregon Health Authority. Oregon is an ideal state in which to conduct the proposed study because of its ongoing commitment to Medicaid health care delivery reform and the commitment of state leaders to collaborate across divisions and programs to ensure this project's success. The project also has the support of key state stakeholders in maternal and child health and women's health. The specific aims of the proposal are to1) develop a research agenda, in collaboration with key stakeholders, to evaluate the expansion of Medicaid on the health of Medicaid-eligible women of reproductive age, mothers, and infants in Oregon; 2) link Oregon Medicaid data for female enrollees ages 15-44 and their infants to statewide datasets, including (but not limited to) live birth, fetal death, infant death, and hospital discharge data, beginning with 2008 and continuing until 2016, as data become available; and 3) conduct planned analyses and disseminate findings. The research agenda will include key research questions that assess the effect of Medicaid expansion on Medicaid enrollment and access to care for low-income women; utilization of services by women and infants enrolled in Medicaid; general health behaviors, risks, and outcomes for these women; and pregnancy complications and poor birth outcomes. We will also measure disparities that remain after Medicaid expansion, to inform strategies to mitigate those disparities on an ongoing basis. We will use results of these analyses to construct simulations that extend this study's findings into implications and lessons for policy makers and stakeholders in other states that are expanding Medicaid. Results of these analyses and simulations will provide valuable information to support health reform efforts, both in Oregon and across the U.S, to reduce the public health burden and improve population health among women of reproductive age, including pregnancy and infant health outcomes."
"9206994","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal regulation of glycemia (dysglycemia) has a very long time course, from its earliest stage, labeled pre-diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The 11-year follow-up DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the relatively brief 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Prevention was cost-saving with MET and cost-effective with ILS. Overall, the risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (A1C). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those who had A1C ?6.5% at study end.  The proposed DPPOS Phase 3 will study the DPPOS cohort for 10 more years, taking advantage of the long-term randomized exposure to MET and the densely phenotyped and genotyped DPPOS cohort (n=2778), which includes nearly 1600 patients with known T2D duration and ~1200 who have not developed T2D, to address yet unanswered questions about long-term exposure to MET and ILS initiated during pre-diabetes. DPPOS Phase 3 will examine outcomes that are of increasing public health concern in the aging population with pre-diabetes and T2D, including the putative benefits of MET on development of CVD and cancer. The main goals of DPPOS Phase 3 are to examine efficiently: 1) the long-term effects of metformin therapy begun in the pre-diabetic phase on risk for CVD and cancer; 2) the long-term effects by intention-to-treat of ILS and MET on further development of T2D and on traditional and more recently recognized complications of dysglycemia, and of their economic impact; and 3) the clinical course of dysglycemia, evaluated by categorical diagnoses (pre-diabetes vs diabetes) and as a continuum, and their associations with the development of complications, including analyses of interactions with DPP interventions and established and novel risk factors."
"9344959","Abstract: Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) affects an ever growing population. While this disease typically has been associated with juveniles, the disease in adult populations is rapidly increasing. The defining clinical component is insulin loss, which occurs because of sustained inflammation in the islets. At present there is no means to prevent or reverse insulin loss. A major inflammatory pathway in T1D that contributes to insulin loss is the CD40 ? CD154 dyad. CD40 is expressed on a wide array of cells and when engaged by CD154 creates localized inflammation. This pathway is decisive in T1D; blocking the interaction prevents diabetes onset and reverses hyperglycemia in new onset diabetic mice. A major impediment to drug development in diabetes has been the failure of therapeutics to translate from mouse to human. Mindful of this, we discovered that CD40 provides a link between mouse and human during T1D. We discovered that NOD mice, the industry standard model for T1D, increase CD40 expression, including on a sub population of T cells during diabetes development. Those cells, termed Th40, not only expand in number as diabetes develops but Th40 cells are singularly capable of transferring T1D to scid recipients. In a translational approach, we discovered that Th40 cells become prominent in human T1D patients, regardless of the age, HLA haplotype, auto-antibody status, or duration of disease. Like in the mouse model, Th40 cells start at low percentages but increase as human subjects progress to T1D and remain at high levels even up to 40 years after diagnosis. New onset as well as long ? term diabetic patients have highly expanded numbers of Th40 cells when compared to non-autoimmune, or type 2 diabetic controls. A portion of TrialNet defined Pre-T1D subjects also have expanded Th40 cell numbers, suggesting that these cells become pathogenic over time, depending upon CD40 expression. Controlling CD40 therefore will be therapeutically advantageous. Methods to control CD40 have relied upon monoclonal antibodies or randomly generated, small organic molecules. Both those options have failed clinically. To address this, we developed a series of peptides derived from the CD154 protein sequence that are designed to target CD40 binding sites. These peptides do not function like antibodies and unlike the random generated organic molecule approach, have high specificity for CD40. In preliminary work we determined that some of the peptides prevent diabetes onset in NOD mice and one of the peptides (thus far) reversed hyperglycemia in new onset diabetic mice. The goals of this grant are to establish clinical parameters that will allow further development of a lead candidate for therapeutic development. We propose to determine how candidate peptides impact glucose tolerance testing, serum insulin levels and c-peptide levels."
"9309787","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  L1CAMs are a family of immunoglobulin cell adhesion molecules that play important roles in the development of nervous system, including axon guidance and morphogenesis as well as axon myelination. Mutations in L1CAMs are directly linked to the neurological L1 syndrome, the symptoms of which include mental retardation and hydrocephalus. In addition, L1CAMs are implicated in neurosychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, the autistic spectrum disorder, and addiction. One salient feature of L1CAM-associated diseases is that they are heterogeneous and genetically complex and subject to genetic modification, pointing to the existence of as-yet-unidentified functions for L1CAMs that are likely masked by genetic compensatory mechanisms. As transmembrane proteins, L1CAMs sit on the plasma membrane and thus are primed to integrate extracellular signals, converting them into cellular responses that require cross-talk with the cytoskeletal and intracellular signaling networks. Molecular mechanisms by which cell adhesion receptors relay these signals are just beginning to be uncovered, but much is still unknown. This application seeks to fill these gaps, identifying previously- uncharacterized L1CAM functions in synaptic regulation and defining the molecular mechanisms by which L1CAMs are functionally linked to intracellular signaling networks.  We have established C. elegans as a powerful genetic system to dissect the roles and mechanisms of L1CAMs. In our previous studies, we determined that the C. elegans L1CAMs, SAX-7 LAD-2 function in maintaining nervous system integrity and axon guidance respectively. We have made significant inroads into defining L1CAM mechanisms of action that are remarkably conserved between mammals and C. elegans. Our recent studies, which took advantage of the ability to easily conduct modifier screens in C. elegans, identified the interplay between the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade and L1CAMs in an unexpected role in synaptic regulation. To better define the molecular mechanisms that link L1CAMs and MAPK to the synaptic machinery, our aims are 1) to define the roles of SAX-7 and MAPK in the synaptic vesicle cycle, 2) to resolve how SAX-7 and MAPK-1 coordinately regulate synaptic function, and 3) to define the factors that mediate SAX-7 and MAPK roles in synaptic transmission. With L1CAMs and MAPK implicated in both intellectual disability and the autism spectrum, this basic research in C. elegans will reveal fundamental knowledge on synaptic modulation that will provide additional insight into mechanisms underlying human neuropsychiatric disorders."

"9418365","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nephritis is a common and serious manifestation of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus for which there is no adequate therapy. Some patients will exhibit a response to current immunosuppressive regimens while others will not; all are at risk for on and off target toxicities. The current proposal is to apply new technologies for high resolution analyses of gene expression and immunophenotype to kidney, blood and urine of lupus patients with active nephritis in order to develop a better understanding of disease pathogenesis and tissue injury, and stratify patients with respect to therapeutic response for more informed clinical decision making. We will explore blood and urine for less invasive surrogate markers for kidney inflammation. Our plan relies of optimization of analytic approaches, informed choice of cellular subpopulations to analyze, followed by two small studies to refine and validate the approach. In the first, we will study kidneys, blood and urine o 20 patients at a time of renal flare in order to dissect patterns of inflammation. In the second we will study cellular subsets in blood of 40 patients who were part of a clinical trial of lupus nephritis to understand changes from baseline profiles of gene expression and function response in those who experienced a full clinical response to therapy and those who failed to respond. Finally, we will use the information from these studies to design a large scale longitudinal study of patients with lupus nephritis. This unbiased re-examination of this unmet medical challenge should identify novel therapeutic targets, inform the generation of new models of disease, and lead to predictors of response that can then be validated in clinical trials We have unique technology resources and a powerful consortium of clinical investigators in the newly established Lupus Nephritis Trials Network that includes: (i) the infrastructure and expertise for clinical study implementation; (ii) protocols and consents for acquisition of blood, urine, and biopsy specimens; and (3) scalability to move from phase 0 and 1 to phase 2 at the appropriate time."
"9412208","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A decline in mitochondrial and respiratory chain function occurs over time and likely contributes to the aging process as well as to the onset of numerous age-associated diseases. Many factors contribute including mitochondrial and nuclear genome mutations in respiratory chain genes as well as the degeneration of the respiratory chain complexes themselves. A prominent hypothesis is that by simply inducing cells to increase mitochondrial biogenesis, many of the cellular defects and disease symptoms can be alleviated. In this proposal, we aim to understand the intrinsic pathways employed by cells to adapt metabolism as well as promote respiratory chain biogenesis during age-associated mitochondrial dysfunction.  We have demonstrated that the mitochondrial unfolded protein (UPRmt) is regulated by the transcription factor ATFS-1, which during mitochondrial stress leads to the transcriptional induction of protective genes including mitochondrial chaperones and proteases, anti-ROS machinery, mitochondrial fission and autophagy machinery. More recently, we have found that in addition to adapting mitochondrial proteostasis, the UPRmt also has a prominent role in adapting metabolism to promote respiratory chain biogenesis within stressed mitochondria while inducing the glycolysis pathway to maintain ATP levels.  In this proposal, we aim to understand the interaction of the UPRmt with a separate, recently discovered, mitochondrial protective stress response. We have identified a separate transcription factor, ZIP-3, that is simultaneously activated during mitochondrial stress that specifically induces transcription of respiratory chain genes. Interestingly, our preliminary data suggest that ATFS-1 fine-tunes respiratory chain transcription by antagonizing ZIP-3, to match the protein-folding capacity in the stressed organelle and promote complex assembly. We anticipate a complete understanding of the interactions between these two pathways will reveal strategies cells employ to increase mitochondrial biogenesis during suboptimal conditions; a scenario potentially quite different than that found during development or normal cell division.  Aim 1 is to determine how ATFS-1 adjusts respiratory chain transcription to promote complex assembly during stress. Our preliminary data suggest a novel form of regulation where ATFS-1 binds directly to promoters in both genomes.  Aim 2 is to understand how the recently identified transcription factor ZIP-3 is regulated during mitochondrial stress to induce respiratory chain gene transcription.  Aim 3 is to understand how these two pathways integrate during normal aging as well as age- associated stress to promote respiratory chain biogenesis and impact longevity."
"9220657","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The brain processes information and generates behavior by transmitting signals at its synapses, which connect neurons into vast networks of communicating cells. These networks, known as neural circuits, are not static but are modified throughout life by experience. Such neural circuit plasticity is critical for the brain to develop normally and perform all of its important functions, including learning and memory. When brain plasticity mechanisms function abnormally, however, devastating mental illnesses often ensue. Thus, a major goal of neuroscience research is to understand the detailed mechanisms by which the brain activity generated by experiences modifies neural circuit behavior. This occurs in large part because neural activity continually adjusts the efficiency or strength of synaptic communication between neurons, a process known as synaptic plasticity. Despite the importance of synaptic plasticity for brain development and higher brain functions, relatively litte is known about its molecular mechanisms other than it is commonly triggered by activity- dependent changes in intracellular calcium levels. This Conte Center will bring together four leading investigators to continue their previous efforts to use innovative molecular genetic manipulations combined with sophisticated and unique biochemical, electrophysiological, and imaging assays to elucidate highly novel mechanisms that underlie different forms of synaptic plasticity and how these forms of synaptic plasticity play a role in adaptive and pathological forms of experience-dependent plasticity, including learning and memory. The new insights into synaptic and circuit plasticity mechanisms generated by this Conte Center will influence a broad array of neuroscientists working on a wide range of topics related to normal and pathological brain function. The Center will also provide the research community with novel molecular genetic tools and genetically modified mice that can be used to manipulate proteins critical for synaptic plasticity throughout the brain to explore the roles of these critical proteins in specifi cell types that participate in a wide range of normal and pathological behaviors. Thus the Center will provide both technological and intellectual innovations to one of the most important areas of neuroscience research with far ranging implications for our understanding of normal and diseased brain function. Relevance The effectiveness of communication between nerve cells is modified by experience and these modifications are crucial for all normal brain functions including learning and memory. The goal of this Center is to determine the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for these modifications. Such information will lead to a better understanding of the causes of mental illness and eventually to the development of more efficacious treatments"
"9204866","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): After your arm has fallen asleep from an irregular posture, blood rushes back into the limb and nerves previously deprived of oxygen and electrolytes spontaneously regain function. During this process cellular and molecular processes within the ischemic limb may be producing bioactive restorative and regenerative compounds. Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) is used to describe the process of transiently impeding blood flow to a limb and has shown to provide protection from subsequent major ischemic events in the brain and other organs. RIC can be achieved through a simple and cost-effective technique of applying a tourniquet to a limb for a pre-determined duration. Pre-clinical animal studies on RIC efficacy have been conducted in models of cardiac arrest and cerebral ischemia in which histopathological and functional outcomes have been improved by either pre-injury or post-injury RIC. Cerebral ischemia and traumatic brain injury (TBI), despite having dissimilar primary pathologies, share common secondary injury processes, including inflammation, oxidative stress, and blood-brain barrier permeability. Based on the pathological processes shared by TBI and cerebral ischemia, in this proposal, we test the hypothesis that remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) restores function following diffuse TBI and examine the potential mechanism of RIC action through a class of small lipids termed specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs).  Aim 1 compares variations in RIC duration and timing in relation to midline fluid percussion brain injury in the rat. Following TBI and RIC, a battery of behavioral assays will be employed to assess the impact of RIC on attenuating the cognitive, sensory, and motor morbidities associated with TBI over a protracted time course. Aim 2, using the most successful variation of RIC identified in Aim 1, will evaluate the effect of RIC on the histopathological consequences of diffuse TBI. Following TBI and RIC, brains will be assessed for markers of neuropathology, inflammation, oxidative stress, and blood-brain barrier permeability. Aim 2 will provide insight into the potential mechanism(s) through which RIC provides protection from neurological injury. These studies can directly impact the course of understanding and treatment for the estimated 1.7 million traumatic brain injuries that occur annually in the United States. Ultimately, RIC could serve as a fast-acting invention for delivering endogenous restorative and reparative compounds to improve outcome from TBI."
"9389300","?    DESCRIPTION: The proposed training program will expand and reposition our highly successful pre- and postdoctoral training program in mental health services research with an emphasis on vulnerable populations, and on those receiving services at the intersection between mental health and human (social) services systems. Our current training program, the only one of its kind in a school of social work, addresses the critical need within the social work profession for scholars trained to investigate mental health challenges confronted by clients of social workers on a daily basis. In this renewal, we have expanded the scope of training to include implementation research, have deepened and strengthened our methodological training, have developed a new program administrative structure, have greatly expanded core and affiliated faculty, have enhanced our postdoctoral program, and have implemented new evaluation strategies. Yet, we have retained what we believe are the core strengths of our program - identification of talented students, early immersion into faculty-led research, intensive preparation in grantsmanship, strong expectations of intellectual individuation and the construction of trajectories toward independence, and a close and intensive mentoring process. This program benefits from the extraordinary growth that has occurred at the Brown School in particular, and Washington University in St. Louis in general, over the past 5 years. We now have a public health program within the School, and our national prominence as a University has resulted in even greater engagement of faculty across all 7 of the University's Schools in the training of our T32 scholars. Our students are benefiting from this engagement in, efflorescence of, scholarship at our institution. Consequently, this application is the most transdisciplinary of all applications that we have submitted to the T32 program. We seek support for 2 pre-doctoral students (same as in prior years), but have requested one additional postdoctoral slot (to a total of 2 postdocs per year) in order to exploit added efficiencies that result from having a cohort of trainees, and greater training opportunities that are now manifest within our School and University. We believe that this proposal reflects the experience that we have gained in 20 years of running a T32 program, and reflects the continual learning and quality improvement that we have undertaken, as we train students for an increasingly dynamic and diverse field of inquiry in the years ahead."

"9406527","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a result of medical advances that prolong the lives of many patients with life- threatening conditions (cancer, AIDS, and transplants), which often compromise host defenses and immunity, the incidence of opportunistic fungal infections continues to increase. The development of new antifungal drugs has improved the prognosis for many patients, but they have also led to the emergence of new and more resistant pathogenic fungi. Thus, it is essential to recruit and train young scientists to develop rigorous independent careers focused on mycological research. The same mandate applies to research on fungal plant pathogens, which continue to reduce the global food supply. In contrast, several innocuous fungal species have become powerful surrogates for studies of eukaryotic biology and genetics. These model fungi species have proved indispensable in driving progress in biomedical sciences and biotechnology. Thus, investigators and institutes in multiple areas of research continue to seek scientists who are capable of utilizing model fungi as experimental tools.             This application proposes a continuation of the multidisciplinary, tri-institutional Molecular Mycology and Pathogenesis Training Program (MMPTP), which was awarded 10 years ago. The MMPTP involves three neighboring institutions, Duke University, North Carolina State University and North Carolina University at Chapel Hill. The 26 faculty members constitute perhaps the largest concentration of researchers who study fungi. They share resources, interact regularly, and collaborate frequently. The MMPTP recruits, supports, and trains promising postdoctoral scientists and physicians to develop productive research careers in molecular mycology and pathogenesis. Candidates for training include recent doctoral graduates in biomedical sciences, physicians who have completed residency training, and experienced postdoctoral fungal researchers with outstanding potential who are supported for shorter tenures to enhance their expertise. These trainees will become the future experts and leaders in diverse areas of fungal research in academia, industry, and government. The MMPTP has been highly successful. All 24 trainees who completed the program have productive careers in science. One is a governmental scientist, seven are in industry, and 16 are in academia including multiple alumni who are assistant and associate professors with tenure excelling in mycology."
"9233742","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) is a major cause of death in the United States. Current pharmacological treatments and implantable cardiac assist devices may contribute to improving symptoms of HF on the short term but they are insufficient to restore and maintain cardiac integrity and function on the long term. Autologous stem cell therapy has been introduced as a promising alternative approach to current therapies for HF. However, the reparative responses of either endogenous or adoptively transferred stem cells are limited due to extremely poor engraftment rates and increased susceptibility to cell death in the unfavorable necrotic environment. Hence, genetic modification and ex vivo expansion of stem cells from diverse origins, including cardiac-derived progenitor cells (CPCs), have been pursued to improve their growth and survival capabilities and eventually promote superior regeneration in vivo. Extracellular nucleotides released during cardiac ischemia initiate inflammatory and regenerative responses required for the healing of injured myocardium through the activation of multiple transmembrane nucleotide receptors, including P2Y2 receptor (P2Y2R), a G protein-coupled receptor that is equipotently activated by ATP and UTP. In addition to its established cardioprotective responses in both rodent animal models and human cardiomyocytes, P2Y2R agonists ATP and UTP are potent stimulants of human hematopoietic stem cell (hHSC) proliferation and migration. ATP also induces the differentiation of human bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Nonetheless, the physiological roles of extracellular nucleotides in CPCs have not been adequately addressed. This proposal aims to explore the physiological responses mediated by P2 nucleotide receptors with a focus on the P2Y2R in CPCs and identify the underlying mechanisms. Research strategy involves initial in vitro characterization of P2Y2R-mediated responses in mouse and human CPCs using pharmacological as well as loss- and gain-of- function studies. The in vitro findings will be extended in vivo by overexpressing P2Y2R in human CPCs prior to adoptive transfer in infarcted mouse myocardium, which we hypothesize improves CPC-mediated reparative potential of injured myocardium following myocardial infarction. We also hypothesize that P2Y2R-induced regenerative responses in CPCs involve the activation of Hippo signaling pathway that is known to be regulated by various G protein-coupled receptors. This provides a novel direct link between extracellular nucleotides released during cardiac ischemia, extracellular matrix sensing and Hippo signaling that has been recently introduced as an important regulator for cardiac regeneration following injury."

"9311467","Project Summary Filoviruses, which include the ebolaviruses and marburgviruses, are non-segmented, negative-sense RNA viruses (NNSVs) that cause severe human disease. These viruses are of concern as emerging pathogens and as potential bioterrorism threats. Their importance and public health impact are reinforced by the West Africa epidemic that began in winter of 2014 and has resulted in more than 11,000 deaths and the export of Ebola virus disease to the U.S., the U.K. and Europe. Although the past year has seen progress toward development of effective vaccines and treatments, current prophylactic and treatment options remain limited. Particularly lacking are effective small molecule inhibitors. Complicating development of anti-filovirus drugs is the biosafety level 4 (BSL4) containment needed to work with live filoviruses, which is only available at a few locations worldwide. With substantial restrictions on the number of investigators who have access to such facilities, antiviral testing against infectious virus in a high throughput setting is problematic. An alternate approach is to develop assays of specific viral functions that can be assessed without generation of infectious materials. The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) complex is a particularly promising candidate. The complex consists of the viral nucleoprotein (NP), viral protein of 35KDa (VP35), VP30 and the large protein (L) which is the enzymatic component of the complex and the only enzyme encoded by the virus. The RDRP complex is required for viral mRNA expression and viral genome replication and is therefore essential for virus growth. Inhibition of the RDRP complex would arrest virus replication. The Basler and Shaw laboratories collaborated to optimize for 384-well high throughput screening a minigenome assay in which a functional EBOV RDRP complex is reconstituted by transfection of plasmids that express its four components into mammalian cells. RDRP activity is measured through the co-expression of a model viral RNA (minigenome RNA) that encodes a reporter gene flanked by the appropriate virus-derived cis-acting regulatory sequences. This system has been successfully transferred to collaborator Sumit Chanda at Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute where a 6,400 compound pilot screen was performed. This screen yielded hits which were carried through to BSL4 testing by Robert Davey at Texas Biomedical Research Institute and demonstrated to inhibit Ebola virus replication. We propose to exploit this assay and this drug discovery pipeline to identify novel small molecule inhibitors of the Ebola virus polymerase. We will also develop additional HTS-compatible minigenome assays based on other filoviruses associated with deadly human disease, including Bundibugyo ebolavirus and Marburg virus, to identify and prioritize hits with pan-filovirus activity. A combination of minigenome assay and filovirus BSL4 experiments will define mechanisms of action, and together with initial SAR studies will prioritize hits for future development. The completion of these studies will significantly expand the number of potential therapeutic small molecules and provide significant insight into inhibition of the filovirus RDRP complex."
"9314190","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In the general population, less than 1% of children develop seizures, whereas over 30% of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) do so by adolescence. Maternal infection during pregnancy is a risk factor for both ASD and epilepsy, however we have limited understanding of how early-life immune insults alter neural circuitry implicated in both disorders. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is a brain region important for regulating diverse cognitive and emotional behaviors altered in ASD. We have obtained pilot data supporting altered mPFC circuit function after gestational exposure to a viral mimetic polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)). Using a high-throughput multisite field potential recording approach in acute mPFC brain slices, our preliminary results indicate that maternal immune activation (MIA) leads to persistent alterations in mPFC activity, at both presynaptic and postsynaptic loci, and an increased susceptibility to generation of epileptic activities in vitro. The proposed experiments will elucidate the precise cell type- and lamina-specific alterations underlying changes in network excitability. Aim 1 of this proposal will identify changes to functional intracortical connectivity within the mPFC. Pregnant dams will be treated with saline or poly(I:C) to mount an acute antiviral inflammatory response. Acute brain slices containing mPFC will be prepared from adult offspring at three to four months of age. Laser scanning photostimulation based on patterned glutamate uncaging will be used to map excitatory synaptic connectivity within the mPFC between photo-excited presynaptic neurons and individual postsynaptic pyramidal and interneurons. Changes to laminar-specific inputs to excitatory and inhibitory cells types following MIA will be assessed by intracellular voltage-clamp recordings of synaptic activity. Immunohistochemical methods will confirm cell type, location and morphology and will be used to identify structural defects in lamination. Aim 2 will evaluate alterations in the recruitment of distal inputs to the mPFC from two regions highly implicated in the initiation and spread of limbic seizures, the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and ventral hippocampus (vHC). AAV-CamKII?-ChR2/eYFP will be used to target expression of channelrhodopsin-eYFP or eYFP alone to excitatory neurons in these extra-prefrontal structures. Postsynaptic currents in mPFC in L2/3 and L5 neurons will be measured in response to optogenetic activation of BLA and vHC terminals, respectively, and changes in excitatory and inhibitory components assessed. Together these aims address circuit intrinsic and extrinsic changes that may contribute to the shared pathogenesis of ASD and epilepsy. Information gained from the interrogation of mPFC circuitry in an established MIA model will identify neuropathological alterations that might be targeted for therapies."
"9316854","ABSTRACT This proposal applies a microfluidic oxygen gradient with multimodal stimulations and detections to investigate a possible link between hypoxia and free fatty acid (FFA) exposures in beta cell impairments and apoptosis. Distinct from the autoimmune pathology in type I diabetes, type II diabetes development relating to beta cell dysfunction is not well understood, including numerous pathological mechanisms and risk factors. Many risk factors coexist in obesity and could possibly interact synergistically. For example, elevated FFA in obesity can lead to insulin deficiency, although only a fraction of people with high FFA develop diabetes. On the other hand, hypoxia can also suppress insulin secretion, but no clear mechanism leading to the development of diabetes has been discovered. Intriguingly, recent studies suggest that both FFA and hypoxia exacerbate beta cell ER stress via the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways, possible through reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, neither factor was sufficient to induce beta cell apoptosis alone. This suggests that a synergistic effect might exist, as hypoxia also affects FFA levels in vivo. Despite suggestive evidences of this fatty acid-hypoxia link, however, its potential role in islet pathophysiology has not been demonstrated. One reason is the lack of proper techniques for controlling hypoxia at the microscale level of beta cells. Standard hypoxic chambers cannot generate a gradient to test multiple exposures, nor can they provide in situ microscopy of beta functions. Proposed here is a multimodal microfluidic device with integrated oxygen gradient for hypoxia and FFA exposures. It incorporates an open-top design to allow easy access for normal cell culturing and assay reagent exchange. Furthermore, a novel hydrogel sensor film is layered directly beneath the cells to provide in situ spatial insulin detections, in addition to spatial monitoring of Ca2+ and ROS via microscopy. Aim 1 applies this gradient to probe multiple hypoxia and FFA concentrations individually in the impairment of beta function and viability. Aim 2 will test the combinatory effects of both factors at or below their transition concentrations in a stimulation matrix. The key technology is using microfluidics to discretely control each of the factors, enabling studies of their interactions in well-controlled beta cell cultures, leading to a more deterministic results. By proving the hypothesis of FFA-hypoxia synergy in inducing beta cell impairment and apoptosis, a potential mechanism can be proposed towards the complicated development of type II diabetes. The results obtained from these feasibility experiments will provide target parameters to be tested in a larger high-throughput microfluidic array."
"9423129","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Data from our 4-year longitudinal study entitled Brain changes and risk factors causing impaired mobility have shown important relations among 24-hour systolic BP, progression of white matter hyperintensity (WMH) lesions and impaired mobility. Hence, in this application, we are proposing a randomized trial to reduce 24- hour ambulatory systolic BP (24ASBP) to 2 levels (usual vs. intensive ABP control) to mitigate the brain changes (WMHs) that are associated with impaired mobility. An increasing body of knowledge has related WMH to functional deterioration of mobility, urinary control and cognition. In baseline data from the precursor to this proposal we performed hypothesis-driven evaluations of WMH within brain regions (rWMH) known to be critical to mobility, cognition or voiding. These studies confirmed an association between rWMH and functional assessments suggesting that specific WM damage was linked to impaired function. While the 3 studies used different rWMHs (function dependent), a subsequent pooled analysis using rWMHs important for function demonstrated powerful correlations between rWMH and global WMH (tWMH) with r values of 0.5-0.9 for 8 of 10 structures). The tWMH predicted functional measures of mobility, executive function/processing speed and urinary function nearly as well as the best regional measures. The tWMH independently explains 5-11% of the variability for mobility, executive function/processing speed, and urinary incontinence severity and is a sensitive (r = 0.7-0.8) predictor of functional decline. Odds of decline in each of the 3 functional domains increased 1.5 to 2.4 fold with each 1% increase in tWMH.  Ambulatory BP (ABP) data (but not clinic BP data) showed that in those subjects whose initial and 2 year 24-h systolic BP was <130 mmHg, significantly less WMH was observed than those whose 24-h systolic BP was >140 mmHg. Increases in ABP and WMH were significantly linked to less effective mobility documented by slower usual and maximal gait velocity and increased turn and stair descent time. Cognitive function was also diminished in the group with higher ABPs. Thus, small differences in 24-h systolic BP (10 mmHg), considered within the normotensive range for this age group, can result in clinically relevant differences in the accrual of tWMH and results in decreases in mobility and some aspects of cognitive function. The goal of the present proposal is to assess causality between 24-h systolic BP and reductions in mobility, cognitive and urinary function associated with WMH changes in brain as well as microstructural integrity as determined by diffusion tensor imaging in older people. The study will determine the impact of reducing the 24-h systolic BP to a goal of <125 mmHg (intensive BP control) vs. a goal of <140 mmHg (standard BP control). This separation of the ABP levels should achieve >10 mmHg differences between the groups that we believe is a key factor for reducing mobility impairment associated with WMH in older patients with systolic hypertension. This will be the first trial to study the ability to slow progression of WMHs to halt the resultant functional impairment by intensive reduction of ABP."
"9386395","ABSTRACT Adhesion of platelets to stimulated endothelium contributes to thrombotic events associated with arterial thrombosis and ischemic stroke. Although anti-platelet agents have reduced unfavorable outcomes, it is well appreciated that the risk for bleeding or recurrent thrombotic events persists. The pathophysiological function of the protein von Willebrand factor (VWF) in arterial thrombosis and stroke has been validated by experimental and clinical studies. VWF is important for mediating the tethering of the flowing platelets over the surface-bound VWF that result in platelet adhesion, activation, and aggregation ? and ultimately occlusion of the vessel. Recently, we described that vimentin expressed on the cell surface of platelets binds to VWF and contributes to platelet adhesion at high shear stress. We also have shown that a recombinant A2 domain of VWF (?A2 protein?) with binding activity for vimentin blocked the interaction between vimentin and VWF. Additional experiments employing endothelial cells (ECs), which also express vimentin on the cell surface, revealed that that A2 protein prevented the formation of ultra large (long) VWF multimers or VWF strings on normal ECs and failed to interact with vimentin-deficient ECs. Moreover, the large number of VWF strings observed at the endothelial surface of stimulated cerebral arteries from wild type (WT) mice contrast to the significantly less strings seen on arteries from vimentin deficient mice. These data demonstrate for the first time the presence of hyperadhesive VWF strings in the cerebrovasculature and the potential for these strings in cerebrovascular pathologies. Finally, injury-induced thrombus formation in distal middle cerebral artery (MCA) and severity of ischemic stroke was reduced in Vim(-/-) compared to WT mice. The central hypothesis of this application is that cell-surface expressed vimentin interacts with the A2 domain of VWF strings, thus contributing to anchoring of VWF strings to the stimulated endothelium and attachment to circulating platelets. This application also proposes to test the hypothesis that disrupting the vimentin/VWF interaction reduces thrombosis and further damage during ischemic reperfusion. Three aims are proposed: Aim 1) Define the essential sites in vimentin and VWF that are involved in the vimentin/VWF interaction on platelets and endothelial cells; Aim 2) Determine the role of platelet and endothelial vimentin in thrombosis in vivo; and Aim 3) Demonstrate therapeutic benefit of disrupting the vimentin-VWF interaction following stroke. Completion of these aims will impact public health by demonstrating a novel receptor for VWF, and will lay the foundation to test this new interaction as a therapeutic target to prevent arterial thrombosis and treat ischemic stroke."
"9258013","Project Summary While current antiretroviral (ART) therapies are able to control viral replication, they are unable to fully restore health or a normal immune status. ART-treated individuals still experience several co-morbidities including increased cardiovascular disease, bone disorders and cognitive impairment. Most importantly, therapy interruption leads to the re-emergence of viral replication and AIDS progression. Therefore, the development of new approaches aimed at eradicating or functionally curing HIV infection are desperately needed. Shock- and-kill strategies represent promising approaches to HIV eradication. However, latently infected cells in which viral production has been induced by latency-reversing agents are unlikely to be depleted in the absence of an efficient immune response. An alternative and perhaps more realistic approach to eliminate latently infected cells after viral reactivation relies on the ability of immune cells to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Through ADCC, effector cells such as NK cells and monocytes can kill infected cells expressing the envelope glycoproteins (Env) through recognition by HIV-specific antibodies. Because the HIV- 1 Vpu and Nef proteins keep Env-CD4 complexes, the major target for ADCC, off the cell surface, this immune mechanism is naturally relatively inefficient. However, we recently discovered that CD4-mimetic compounds (CD4mc) are able to push the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Env) to sample the CD4-bound conformation, resulting in sensitization of HIV-1-infected cells to ADCC. Our observations suggest that CD4mc could be useful for the kill part of the shock-and-kill strategy being pursued to purge the HIV reservoir, and thus could have therapeutic utility in decreasing the size of the viral reservoir upon reactivation. The objective of this proposal is to provide a proof of concept for the value of CD4mc in reducing the size of the viral reservoir in SHIV-infected rhesus macaques, which could expedite application to HIV-1-infected humans.  "
"9391415","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Orofacial clefts (OFCs) are the most common craniofacial birth defect in humans and are caused by multiple genetic and environmental risk factors. Elucidating the etiologies of clefting is critical not only for our knowledge of developmental biology and for how clefts arise, but ultimately for improved prevention, treatment, and prognosis for individuals affected by orofacial clefting. Our innovative approach for identifying genetic risk factors for orofacial clefts is to improve the power to detect associations by expanding the phenotypic spectrum to include subclinical phenotypes. These subclinical phenotypes, such as discontinuities of the orbicularis oris muscle of the upper lip, ar generally increased in unaffected family members compared to controls, providing evidence that they are part of the range of phenotypes associated with OFCs. The goal of this K99/R00 application is to use subclinical phenotypes to identify genetic risk factors for OFCs and improve our understanding of their role in causing clefts. The overall hypothesis for this project is that subclinical phenotypes are the mildest expression of OFC risk factors and genetic risk factors will be shared between individuals with subclinical phenotypes and individuals with OFCs. These hypotheses will be tested in three specific aims: In Aim 1, I will examine subclinical phenotypes and genetic variants in a cohort of twin pairs who are discordant for orofacial clefts. In Aim 2 I will conduct candidate gene association studies in OFCs and related subclinical phenotypes. In Aim 3, I will perform exome sequencing in families with OFCs and subclinical phenotypes. The K99 phase of this project will be completed at the University of Pittsburgh under the guidance of Dr. Mary Marazita (mentor) and Dr. Eleanor Feingold (co-mentor). The Candidate has also assembled an accomplished group of consultants and external advisors who will provide the necessary training and support to accomplish the proposed research, facilitate the growth of the Candidate, and provide guidance during the transition to independence. The proposed training and research aims are tailored to provide additional training in subclinical phentoyping and statistical genetics to facilitate the Candidate's development as an independent craniofacial geneticist who integrates deep genetic resources with detailed phenotyping to study complex craniofacial disorders."
"9246766","PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic HCV infection afflicts 180 million individuals throughout the world. The majority of individuals infected with HCV develop persistence, suggesting that HCV successfully subverts innate and adaptive immune responses. Mathematical models have projected a massive increase in the number of patients developing HCV-related complications (e.g., cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma) in the next few decades as the population ages. Although hepatocytes comprise the majority of the total cell population within the liver, the non- parenchymal liver cells have been increasingly recognized as playing central roles in chronic inflammation and complications from HCV infection. Although the development of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) has led to nearly miraculous cure rates [compared to interferon (IFN)-based therapy], a number of important questions remain unanswered that demand further study. To what extent is immunity restored in patients cured with DAAs and what are the effects on cross-talk between the multiple cell types within the hepatic microenvironment? What effect does HCV cure have on inflammation, fibrosis development, and further hepatic decompensation? The answers to these questions have remained elusive and have implications for other liver disease. Here, we will define the breadth and pace of reconstitution of hepatic and peripheral innate and adaptive immunity induced by DAA therapy in patients with chronic HCV infection. We will also determine how DAA-mediated viral eradication affects epigenetic reprogramming of HCV-specific CTLs. A large cohort of already-enrolling patients, including those who have previously failed DAA therapy and have evidence of resistance-associated variants, will be serially studied according to pre-treatment viral level and fibrosis stage. Next, we will characterize the complex communication between hepatocytes and nonparenchymal cells (NPCs) in HCV infection and the impact of DAA-mediated viral elimination. We hypothesize that exosomes play important roles in intercellular communication that is intricately linked to the cell origin of the exosomes, as well as the biologic milieu; exosomes can shuttle HCV and biologically active molecules from infected hepatoma cells to a variety of NPC. We will examine how purified exosomes derived from HCV-infected and DAA-cured hepatocytes differentially trigger responses in Kupffer cells (KCs), liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and HSCs. We will comprehensively characterize the exosomal content following HCV exposure and determine which components, including microRNAs, either amplify or attenuate inflammatory or fibrotic pathways. If successful, these studies would provide novel insights into the mechanisms mediating viral clearance, residual inflammation, and liver injury (fibrosis) and have broad-reaching relevance in the rapidly changing field of HCV, potentially opening up new avenues of research into this highly prevalent liver disease worldwide."
"9238460","Project Summary Synthetic Psychoactive Drugs (SPDs) are substances designed to mimic the effects of controlled substances and other abused drugs. Although designer drugs are not a new phenomenon, the number and availability of SPDs is unprecedented and has increased dramatically over the last 5 years. Many hallucinogenic SPDs are structurally similar derivatives of known serotonergic hallucinogens, including drugs such as 25I-NBOMe (?25- I?, ?N-Bomb?), 1-propionyl-LSD, and 5-MeO-DALT. The popularity and proliferation of hallucinogenic SPDs is causing a significant public health problem because they are often highly potent and pose greater risks of toxicity compared with older hallucinogens. Because very little is known about the mechanisms of action and behavioral effects of hallucinogenic SPDs, a NIDA program announcement (PAR-14-106) is soliciting research into ?Synthetic Psychoactive Drugs and Strategic Approaches to Counteract Their Deleterious Effects.? This application seeks support for a project to investigate the specific pharmacological mechanisms, receptor targets, and signaling pathways that mediate the behavioral effects of hallucinogenic SPDs. The proposed research program is part of a larger collaborative effort to rapidly identify and characterize new SPDs, define their structure-activity relationships (SAR), and determine the mechanisms of their hallucinogenic and toxic actions. Hallucinogenic drug effects in rodents are assessed using two complementary behavioral paradigms: exploratory locomotor behavior, which has a direct counterpart in human studies; and the head twitch response (HTR), which is a hallucinogen-sensitive behavioral assay. Aim 1 will elucidate the mechanisms of action of SPD analogs of indoleamine hallucinogens, testing the hypothesis that these hallucinogenic SPDs (including tryptamines, benzofurans, and LSD analogs) act through 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors. Studies will compare SPD effects with the known profiles of serotonergic hallucinogens and define the SAR of SPD analogs of indoleamine hallucinogens. Aim 2 will elucidate the structural features and second messenger systems mediating the behavioral effects of the highly potent N-benzylphenethylamine class of hallucinogenic SPDs, known as ?NBOMes,? that are related to hallucinogens such as mescaline. Aim 2 studies are designed to assess (1) the link between specific structural features in NBOMes and their 5-HT2A affinities, and (2) the contributions of specific signaling pathways and 5-HT2A functional selectivity to the behavioral effects of these hallucinogenic SPDs. Aim 3 will assess the contributions of metabolites to the behavioral and toxicological effects of hallucinogenic SPDs. The idea that 1P-LSD acts as a pro-drug for LSD and the hypothesis that some SPD toxicity is due to O-demethylated metabolites will be tested. These studies address receptor interactions that have important implications for understanding the psychotomimetic effects of hallucinogens in general. The results of these studies will aid in predicting the effects and potential toxicities of new SPDs and will help clinicians to develop strategies to mitigate the effects and consequences of hallucinogenic SPD use."
"9383152","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The success of clinical transplantation is one of modern medicine's hallmark achievements. Unfortunately, a severe shortage of human organs, cells, and tissues constrains application of this life-saving technology. This RFA recognizes the potential for transplants from another species to humans (xenotransplantation) to fulfill the fields potential. For scientific and ethical reasons, a consensus has formed around discerning how to safely use pig organs for this purpose.  Clinical application of pig-to-human xenografts is currently prevented by vigorous immunologic barriers. Major progress has been made over the past two decades to understand and overcome these barriers, with key contributions over the past 9 years from our Program and other NIAID Consortium members. Most importantly, our Program has produced pigs that express a large number of human proteins that each protects the pig organ from injury by the primate immune response. The lung xeno model has been particularly useful to demonstrate the value of each of these modifications, and to identify remaining problems. With a combination of three to six gene modifications to the pig, and a carefully tailored drug treatment regimen to the recipient, current results have advanced from minutes to hours (lung) or days (liver), with more significant progress for kidneys (from weeks to months) and hearts, where survivals past one and even two years have recently been accomplished by members of our consortium.  Our proposals in response to the current RFA concentrate attention largely on the residual problem of the inflammatory response to pig organs. We shall explore methods of preventing or suppressing this response through either novel pig genetics or pharmacologic interventions. We will investigate transplantation of organs from these novel pigs, modifications to our already successful immunosuppressive regimen (in an effort to minimize infectious complications), and several anti-inflammatory agents that might allow consistent long-term (>6 months) pig kidney and heart graft survival, while significantly extending survival of livers and lungs. These studies will be carried out in our established kidney  (Pittsburgh), heart (NHLBI), liver and lung (Maryland) models, with all of which we have many years' experience and expertise. The outcomes of our studies will be comprehensively evaluated by numerous laboratory assays, with all of which we have experience at one or more of our participating centers. We hypothesize that, within the 5-year funding period, this will enable consideration to be given to clinical trials of pig kidney, heart, and liver transplantation and will improve lung survival markedly."
"9257774","PROJECT SUMMARY This mentored Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award proposes to provide the trainee, a doctoral student in epidemiology at UCSF, training in cluster-randomized trials, validation studies and quantitative bias analysis. Guided by a team of senior mentors, the trainee will gain the necessary skills, practical experience, and knowledge to launch her academic career as an independent researcher dedicated to using the best epidemiologic methods to evaluate interventions aimed at reducing diarrheal disease and improving child health globally. The proposed training plan and research experience are supplemental to the standard PhD curriculum. Building on prior work of the trainee, this F31 focuses on caregiver report of stool frequency and consistency to measure pediatric diarrhea. Diarrhea is the second leading cause of death and illness among children under five globally. Most studies of pediatric diarrhea use caregiver reported symptoms to quantify disease status. Caregiver reported diarrhea symptoms have never been validated against a gold standard measure. Validation studies assess the accuracy of a measurement and generate misclassification probabilities that can be used in quantitative bias analysis to adjust results for measurement error. Using pictures of stool consistency may improve the validity of caregiver reports. One such tool is the Bristol Stool Form Scale, a pictorial scale of five stool consistency types. The proposed project uses data collected from a cluster-randomized trial studying the effect of constructing hand-dug wells on various child health outcomes in rural Ethiopia. We will compare caregiver's report of stool consistency to the consistency of a collected stool sample. Using quantitative bias analysis techniques, we will use the resulting misclassification probabilities to adjust the trial data for misclassified diarrhea. We will also assess if the Bristol Stool Form Scale improves the accuracy of reported stool consistency. The research program consists of three aims: 1) (a) Establish the validity of caregiver-reported stool consistency and (b) Use quantitative bias analysis to account for misclassified stool consistency and 2) Assess the impact of using the Bristol Stool Form Scale on the validity of caregiver-reported stool consistency. Good outcome measurement is a cornerstone of rigorous quantitative research; the results of this research will provide valuable information on the validity of caregiver-reported stool consistency, generate misclassification probabilities that can be used to correct for measurement error and evaluate a potential low-cost method to improve reporting accuracy."
"9296686","Project Summary Multidrug resistance (MDR) in pathogenic bacteria poses a serious public-health problem. Previously, we have discovered cefoxitin can render methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains sensitive again to oxacillin. We thus hypothesize that small molecules may augment the bactericidal activity of ?-lactams against Gram+ pathogens. After screening a ~60,000 small- molecule library, we obtained candidate compounds with activity against MRSA with sub-MIC oxacillin. While one of the compound DNAC-2 has broad-spectrum activity and low level of toxicity, its core structure shares similarity to 5-hydroxy-quinoline, known to have anti-bacterial activity. To develop novel derivatives, we synthesized a series of unique analogs one of which is called DNAC-23a. In combination with oxacillin, DNAC-23a led to a 64-fold decrease in oxacillin MIC of MRSA strain USA300, rendering an MRSA to a MSSA phenotype. We propose to further characterize DNAC-23a with the following two specific aims: I) to identify the target of DNAC-23a; II) to conduct Structure-Activity-Relationship studies of DNAC-23a. The goal of these studies is to identify novel derivatives with improved efficacy, improved solubility and minimal toxicity. Future studies will focus on the optimal PK/PD values of these compounds, thus enabling us to identify a ?lead compound? for future drug development. As treatment options for resistant Gram+ pathogens are limited, discovery of novel compounds that extend the usage of current beta-lactams represents a potential advance in drug development."
"9227535","Abstract: Ovarian aging is the major underlying cause of reproductive senescence and its associated morbidities, which affect a significant proportion of the female population (Li et al, Human Reproduction, 2013). Cancer therapy induces acceleration of ovarian aging and could potentially involve 1% of the female population over their reproductive life span. My mentor's laboratory discovered that gonadotoxic chemotherapeutics result in primordial follicle death primarily by causing DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in oocytes. My mentor's laboratory also found that this insult triggers an ATM-mediated DNA DSB repair response (Soleimani et al, Aging, 2011), which may enable some primordial follicles to survive this intense genotoxic stress. Furthermore, our laboratory found that DNA DSB repair response is critical in the way oocytes mitigate other genotoxic insults that may be causing aging, and that women who are deficient in DNA DSB repair, specifically BRCA1- mutation carriers, may be prone to prematurely depleting their ovarian reserve (Titus et al, Science Translation, 2013). In addition, our laboratory showed that Sphingosine-1-Phosphate (S1P), a naturally occurring ceramide death-pathway inhibitor, reduces chemotherapy-induced primordial follicle death in human ovarian xenografts (Li et al, Human Reproduction, 2013). Stemming from these discoveries, we hypothesize that pharmacological manipulation of DNA DSB repair mechanisms may temper ovarian aging caused by genotoxic stress. Our overarching aim is to uncover the mechanisms by which S1P protects primordial follicles against genotoxic death and to determine whether S1P's protective effect is applicable to reproductive aging in general. Our specific aims are: 1. To determine whether S1P prevents chemotherapy-induced ovarian aging by enhancing oocyte DNA DSB repair in vitro in mice; 2. To translate the findings from aim 1 to human and to determine if S1P enhances DNA repair in human primordial follicle oocytes in vivo; 3. To determine whether S1P can slow down reproductive aging in vivo in mice. To achieve these aims we will utilize numerous translational approaches that have been previously successful in our laboratory, including but not limited to single cell real time PCR as well as microarray strategies, gene interference, coupled with human ovarian xenografting and laser capture."
"9309111","Project Abstract Very little information regarding the health status of American Samoans are available, and the research infrastructure in America Samoa (AS) requires a sufficient foundation and capacity building to conduct large-scale population health research. The purpose of this project is to: (1) build the research capacity in America Samoa to conduct population health research, and (2) to support a pilot health research project that aims to increase colorectal cancer screening literacy among American Samoans so that initial data will be available and serve as the foundation for future research efforts in America Samoa. This project is a collaborative community and research engaged effort that reflects the community-identified priorities in AS addressing a research gaps in health promotion and cancer prevention. The percentage of American Samoan adults aged 50-75 obtaining CRC screening is far below the US national average, i.e., 7% of American Samoans vs. 58.2% of US adults. Assessment of health literacy levels has been recommended in specific populations and to use assessment results in developing targeted and tailored promotional programs. The proposed Indigenous Samoan Program to Initiate Research Excellence (INSPIRE) ? CRC Literacy. (INSPIRE) aims to: (1) strengthen research capacity by providing technical assistance on research protocol, IRB training, and development of an easily accessed cancer data repository, (2) adapt/pilot the Short form Test of Functional Health Literacy ? Adults (STOFHLA) and administer revision to a representative sample of older adults recruited through Respondent Driven Sampling methods, and (3) informed by STOFHLA results, develop and implement a culturally competent, linguistically appropriate, and theory-informed screening intervention, use of a 2 group pre-post control group comparison, with measurement of Knowledge-Attitude- Behavior (KAB) survey at several points of evaluation and assessment of the primary outcome namely, timely completion of Fecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT). INSPIRE efforts will be led by the AS Community Cancer Coalition in partnership with LBJ Tropical Medical Center (LBJTMC), the AS Department of Health and dedicated technical assistance from consultants associated with the University of Hawai`i and Azusa Pacific University in California, with consultant expertise in health literacy, RDS, cancer screening research, STOFHLA, community-based participatory approaches, multi-modal research/evaluation strategies, and history of positive collaboration with AS partners. This effort should result in increased screening use and contribute to building a foundation for future translational research. INSPIRE-produced research is significant for AS because it lays a much needed foundation for systematic public health research. Further, INSPIRE research will contribute to advancement in the science of health literacy and health promotions with/for resource-poor, yet tradition-rich Indigenous communities thereby, offering the hopeful prospect of eliminating socially-constructed and harmful health inequalities."
"9391501","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nighttime agitation and sleep disturbance in persons with dementia (PWD) causes patient suffering, may accelerate cognitive decline, leads to burdened caregivers, and is costly to manage. Pharmacological interventions are primarily antipsychotics and hypnotics. Effectiveness is unconvincing, and these drugs are associated with falls, strokes, and death. There is a lack of tailored, effective, and sustainable treatments for nighttime agitation and sleep disturbance in PWD. Our approach to this problem is innovative because, unlike pharmacological interventions in the past, it tailors the intervention t a treatable condition, restless legs syndrome (RLS), which may be causing the nighttime agitation and sleep disturbance. In our previous research we showed that about 24% of PWD have an undiagnosed sleep disorder, RLS; that RLS was associated with nighttime agitation and sleep disturbance in PWD; and we developed and validated an RLS diagnostic and outcome measure suitable for PWD. In order for our work to significantly impact standards of clinical practice, evidence is needed on whether RLS behaviors cause nighttime agitation, and if treating RLS behaviors reduces or stops nighttime agitation and improves sleep in PWD. We have chosen gabapentin encarbil (GEn), as the RLS treatment in this research because it is FDA approved for RLS and has a favorable safety profile. We propose an 8-week, double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of GEn versus placebo in 120 nursing home residents with nighttime agitation, sleep disturbance, and RLS. The specific aims of this pilot study are to: 1) Determine the effect of GEn, compared to placebo on nighttime agitation (primary endpoint) in PWD with RLS. We hypothesize that compared to the placebo control group, the treatment group will have fewer nighttime agitation behaviors. 2) Describe the safety profile of GEn compared to placebo in this population. 3) Estimate the effect size of GEn compared to placebo on nighttime sleep and RLS behaviors. We hypothesize that compared to the placebo control group, the treatment group will have better nighttime sleep and fewer RLS behaviors. 4) Explore whether frequency of RLS behaviors is a causal mechanism for nighttime agitation. We hypothesize that frequency of RLS behaviors will mediate the effect of GEn on nighttime agitation behaviors. The results of this study and future definitive trials have the potential to radically shift and drastically improve standards of clinical practice for assessment and treatment of three highly prevalent, often comorbid conditions in PWD: RLS, nighttime agitation, and sleep disturbance. For scientists, our results may provide insight into the mechanism for nighttime agitation and sleep disturbance in PWD and inform future research. For PWD, our findings may result in less nighttime agitation and discomfort from RLS, improved nighttime sleep, and improved sleep may enhance daytime cognitive functioning and quality of life. Application of our findings into the home setting may result in fewer nursing home admissions for PWD and less caregiver burden because the PWD (and their caregivers) can get more sleep."
"9310873","Abstract Mycobacterium tuberculosis kills approximately 1.5 million people annually. It has long been observed that mycobacterial granulomas can be extensively vascularized, but the functional consequences of this vascularization have not been fully examined. Using a zebrafish mycobacterial infection model that recapitulates important aspects of human mycobacterial granulomas, we found that granuloma-induced angiogenesis coincides with the generation of local hypoxia and transcriptional induction of the canonical pro- angiogenic molecule Vegfa. Interception of this pathway with clinically used inhibitors resulted in reduced burden and improved outcome. Building on our preliminary data that suggest a role for the VEGF pathway and the bacterial lipid trehalose dimycolate, we will define the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which pathogenic mycobacteria promote the pro-angiogenic environment of mycobacterial granulomas to facilitate their own growth, dissemination and survival. We also will probe the role of a parallel canonical angiogenic signaling pathway ? the angiopoietin/Tie2 pathway ? for which we have identified a novel host-directed drug that we have shown to be effective in reducing mycobacterial burden in zebrafish. Finally, we will build on our recent data showing induction of these pathways in human granuloma specimens and probe the functional effects of human genetic variants in mycobacterial infection. Overall, this proposal tests the hypothesis that, in a striking parallel to tumor biology, the interplay of angiogenesis, hypoxia and compromised vasculature contributes to mycobacterial pathogenesis. Ultimately, the modulation of these pathways may provide new strategies for host- directed therapies for tuberculosis."
"9223962","PROJECT SUMMARY  I am applying for a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award from NIDDK to facilitate my transition to an independent investigator studying host-microbe interactions and metabolic diseases. I am an experimental biologist with extensive training examining host-microbe interactions in health and disease. My recent publication under the mentorship of Dr. Eugene B. Chang identified that gut microbes exhibit diurnal patterns that are tightly aligned with host circadian rhythm. Diet-induced microbial dysbiosis disrupts this interaction, leading to development of obesity. My proposal will focus on filling gaps in knowledge to define the underlying mechanisms that drive daily microbial oscillations. I will examine the interplay between innate immune functions and diurnal patterns of intestinal microbes located within the distal small intestine. My long- term goal is to gain insights into the bi-directional relationship between host and microbe that leads to the resetting of the localized intestinal clock.  I have designed the career development benchmarks of this K01 award to expand my knowledge base and gain expertise in the areas of molecular circadian biology, microbiology, and innate immune function. I have gathered a mentorship team to oversee my proposed work, which will be lead by Dr. Eugene B. Chang. I will be co-mentored by Drs. Brian J. Prendergast (UChicago), Eve Van Cauter (UChicago), and Mitchell L. Sogin (Marine Biological Laboratory). The mentorship team has participated in designing the career training program and approved the proposed research timeline, coursework, skill development workshops, and manuscript/grant submission timeline. They will be involved throughout the award to provide guidance and oversight for research design and methods, troubleshooting, scientific direction and evaluation, as well as preparation of manuscripts, grants, and presentations. I will receive additional support via my department and division chairs as well as a group of consultants, including Drs. Jennifer Evans (Marquette University ? molecular circadian biology), Aaron Dinner (University of Chicago ? statistical approaches for circadian time series analysis), A. Murat Eren (University of Chicago ? Microbial community analysis), and Dean P. Jones (Emory University ? metabolomics). The research environment at the University of Chicago is ideal to accomplish my proposed research aims and provides all necessary tools to successfully complete my goals.  I will examine the underlying mechanisms that drive daily oscillations in gut microbes, specifically the interplay between innate immune functions and distal small intestinal microbes. I observed that oscillations of gut microbes are synchronized with host diurnal expression patterns of genes involved in antimicrobial peptide synthesis, specifically regenerating islet-derived 3 gamma (Reg3?). How diurnal patterns in Reg3? expression aid in maintenance of normal gut microbial oscillations and what the implications are for host metabolic health remain unexplored. The long-term goal is to determine how oscillations of gut microbes influence diurnal dynamics of intestinal host factors that aid in maintenance of a host-microbe symbiotic relationship. This knowledge could lead to development of new strategies to prevent and treat diet-induced obesity."
"9431686","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Miriam Shelef is clinical instructor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison whose long- term professional goal is to become a clinician scientist, heading a productive research laboratory focused on the role of citrullinating enzymes in rheumatoid arthritis. She completed her MD and PhD at Columbia University College of Physician and Surgeons with graduate training in immunology and molecular biology. She completed internal medicine residency and rheumatology fellowship at the University of Wisconsin where she also received further training in cell motility and arthritis under the guidance of Dr. Anna Huttenlocher. She has published in top tier immunology journals and won several awards, which suggest future success. She is applying for a K08 to obtain the final piece training needed to successfully reach her goals.  She will complete the aims of her K08 award at the University of Wisconsin, which is a top ranked university in terms of quality and breadth of research and research funding. She benefits from a collegial atmosphere and enthusiastic mentors. The UW provides all of the educational activities that she requires and is committed to the development of its junior faculty. Her department is extremely committed to her success and is providing protected time, research space, equipment, and sufficient research funds for the period of the K08. Additionally she has numerous core facilities and institutions to assist with her scientific and career needs.  To get to her goal as a successful independent clinician scientist, she anticipates needing to (1) establish a well-organized, productive laboratory, (2) produce a body of work that informs on the role of PAD2 and PAD4 in rheumatoid arthritis and neutrophil function and provides the foundation for her research program (3), develop expertise in inflammatory arthritis, citrullination, and neutrophils, (4) improve skills in grant writing and submit a R01 level grant, and (5) strengthen research communication through oral presentations and publications. She will accomplish these aims with the assistance of her exceptional mentoring committee comprised of Dr. Anna Huttenlocher, an expert in cell motility and innate immunity, Dr. Molly Carnes, who is devoted to the advancement of women in science, and Dr. Alan Bridges, a well- published rheumatologist who is also Chief of Staff and the Veterans Hospital where Dr. Shelef will start her independent lab. Her research plan contains educational activities in laboratory management, leadership, grant writing, manuscript writing, mentoring, oral presentations, and training in experimental arthritis and neutrophil biology.  Her research is focused on achieving a better understanding of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with the goals of better treatments. RA is an inflammatory arthritis that affects almost 1% of Americans. Current therapies target specific immune cells, activation/proliferation of those cells, or inflammatory cytokines. Many people with RA do not respond to these treatments and suffer from permanent joint destruction and disability indicating a national need for better therapies. To design new therapies, novel components of RA pathophysiology must be targeted. Recent findings indicate that RA is not only an inflammatory arthritis, but a true autoimmune disease characterized by antibodies against citrullinated proteins. RA is thought to occur when low level inflammation, often in the lung, leads to local citrullination, followed by the development of anti- citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs), and ultimately TNF? production, inflammation, and RA. ACPAs are pathologic in and specific for RA, but citrullinated proteins, which increase in numerous inflammatory conditions, have an unclear role in RA, aside from becoming antigens for ACPAs. Dr. Shelef has novel preliminary data that TNF? can drive ACPA production instead of only the reverse as well as the first evidence that PAD4, one of the citrullinating enzymes, contributes to arthritis. Through this award, she will use transgenic mice, murine models of RA, ACPA multiplex arrays, a new citrulline detection probe, and other methods to determine if TNF? can drive ACPA production through lung inflammation, if both PAD4 and PAD2 are required for the production of ACPAs and arthritis development, and if PAD4 contributes to neutrophil function in ways that can contribute to chronic arthritis. The completion of these research aims would shed light on the role of citrullination in arthritis as wel as open novel avenues of drug development involving citrullination."
"9302154","Abstract This proposal will integrate novel cell signaling models of myocyte hypertrophy into organ-level continuum models of ventricular growth, remodeling and mechanoenergetics coupled to hemodynamic models of systemic hypertension. The multi-scale computational models, together with experiments in rats subjected to ventricular hemodynamic overload, will be used to investigate the interactions between anisotropic stretch and neurohormonal signaling pathways in the development of eccentric ventricular hypertrophy, fibrosis and hypertension-induced cardiac remodeling. Specifically, we will use genome-scale data from pressure-overloaded rat hearts to refine and validate quantitative models of hypertrophic regulatory networks. We will use proteomic and transcriptomic measurements from aortic-banded and sham-operated rat hearts to test and refine quantitative systems models of anisotropic stretch- and neurohormonally- simulated cardiac myocyte hypertrophy in vivo. We will also model and validate tissue- and organ-scale growth and remodeling of the heart due to ventricular pressure overload. We will couple cardiovascular system-models of whole body hemodynamics to three-dimensional continuum models of ventricular growth and remodeling driven by hypertrophic signaling models and cell-scale growth laws. Large-scale data sets from high-field diffusion-tensor magnet resonance imaging in the rat, and constrained mixture models, add detailed information on fiber architecture and material properties. Finally, we will predict mechanoenergetic consequences of ventricular hypertrophy. Models will be extended to include remodeling of contractility and energy metabolism pathways, and used to predict alterations in myocardial mechanoenergetics during pressure overload. These model predictions will then be validated with extensive characterization of in-vivo mechanics (by tagged magnetic resonance imaging) and energetics. These new models will be validated and optimized to help define and analyze specific hypertrophic pathways relevant to translational outcomes in hypertensive patients, with the ultimate potential of identifying new diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for hypertensive heart disease."
"9223207","PROJECT SUMMARY The Candidate is a postdoctoral fellow and young investigator dedicated to developing an academic career focused on the identification and characterization of molecular mechanisms stemming from ethanol-induced inflammation, contributing to impaired liver tolerance and tissue injury. With a strong background in oxidative stress and innate immunity related to ethanol-induced liver injury, the candidate has developed particular expertise in the use of mouse models to conduct the proposed studies. Use of these model systems has revealed and important role for complement, and anaphylatoxins in mediating liver inflammation and injury caused by ethanol. Moreover, we hypothesize that altered Treg homeostasis is a causative event for impaired resolution of inflammation and injury. The Candidate's recent and current work has provided her with the opportunity to develop her own research program and begin her transition to independence. The Career Development Plan described in the proposal outlines 2-years of mentored training with includes technical skills training in addition to career development activities designed to promote the successful transition to independence. A 3-year program of independent scientific and career development after successful recruitment as an Assistant Professor position is also outlined. The Candidate's Mentor has a proven track- record of excellent scientific productivity and successful mentorship and can provide the Candidate with a solid research environment in her lab at the Lerner Research Institute at the Cleveland Clinic. Research plan: Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is remains a major socioeconomic burden. For decades, rates of morbidity and mortality have remained constant and the long-term prognosis for patients remains poor. ALD is multifactorial, mediated in part by the innate immune system. Complement, a component of innate immunity, is also implicated in the development of ALD and is becoming an attractive therapeutic target. Our early studies have identified that aberrant, uncontrolled complement activation contributes to tissue injury; however, complement is also required for liver healing. These studies provided the foundation for our current proposal: cell-specific complement therapies are a required alternative to current inhibitory therapies, which can be used as a novel treatment for ALD. Regulatory T cells (Treg) are key contributors to the resolution phase of inflammation and maintain immunological tolerance via secretion of a myriad of immunosuppressive and pro-resolving cytokines. Peripheral Treg are reduced in patients with advanced ALD, but the mechanism by which ethanol alters T cell homeostasis has not been investigated.  It is our working hypothesis that sustained complement activation due to ethanol leads to abnormal regulation of Treg in the liver, thus contributing to liver inflammation and tissue injury. In three specific aims, we will characterize ethanol-mediated Treg differentiation in the liver following Gao-Binge feeding in mice, explore the ability of adoptively transferred ex vivo differentiated iTreg to resolve liver inflammation and diminish liver injury in ethanol-fed mice, and assess the ability of extracellular vesicles to stimulate ex vivo differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells to iTreg and Th17 subtypes. We expect the results of these aims will provide a strong foundation for future mechanistic studies and clinical interventions for ethanol- induced inflammation and tissue injury."
"9206532","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Currently there are no mechanism-based therapies available for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and intellectual disability (ID). The main barrier has been identifying the defective cellular processes within the brain that disrupt behavior and cognition. Increasing evidence indicates that many cases of ASD and ID have a genetic etiology. However, these genetic changes are numerous, often very rare, and remarkably diverse. One way to make sense of these findings is to assume that a plethora of gene mutations may similarly disrupt a common set of physiological processes that ultimately manifest behaviorally as ID and ASD. Testing this assumption is of paramount importance, as not only does it narrow the search for mechanisms of disease pathogenesis, but it also suggests therapeutic strategies that might apply broadly to an entire class of etiologies. Work on animal models of single-gene disorders associated with ID and ASD has supported the idea that one axis of pathophysiology is metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) mediated synaptic protein synthesis and plasticity. In the animal model of fragile X syndrome (FX), mGluR5-mediated protein synthesis and plasticity in the hippocampus are exaggerated. Conversely, in the animal model of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), protein synthesis and plasticity downstream of mGluR5 are diminished. Of particular interest, inhibition of mGluR5 corrects cognitive (and many other) deficits in the FX model, whereas positive modulation of mGluR5 corrects cognitive defects in the TSC model. In the current work, we are asking if gene copy number variation at human chromosome 16p11.2, a polygenic cause of psychiatric illness that can include ID and ASD, similarly disrupts this core synaptic mechanism. This hypothesis is suggested by the findings that many genes in the affected region are predicted to be involved in protein synthesis regulation, and preliminary data in the mouse model of 16p11.2 microdeletion showing disrupted mGluR5-mediated synaptic plasticity and cognitive function, and correction of memory deficits by chronic inhibition of mGluR5. The specific aims of our proposed research are to (a) further characterize the state of synaptic transmission and plasticity in the hippocampus of 16p11.2 CNV model mice, (b) characterize synaptic protein synthesis and the molecular signaling pathways which may be disrupted in these mice, (c) further assess the behavioral deficits in 16p11.2 CNV model mice, and (d) attempt to correct memory deficits with rational pharmacotherapies previously validated in animal models of FX and TSC."
"9239202","Mitochondria are the intracellular organelles responsible for energy production in eukaryotic cells, and are unique in that they contain their own DNA (mtDNA), which encodes genes important for mitochondrial function. While it has been well-established that nuclear DNA has an increased overall burden of mutations in cancers, we recently discovered that the frequency of random mutations in mtDNA is decreased in human tumors relative to healthy tissues. Furthermore, these novel findings provide the framework for the proposed research. We have since demonstrated that the lower burden of mtDNA mutations in tumor tissue is coupled to a decrease in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and, by extension, a reduction in reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated mtDNA damage. These novel findings provide the impetus for the proposed research, as they suggest that, unlike in nuclear DNA, an increased rate of mtDNA mutagenesis does not facilitate a cancer?s development; rather, it may hinder it. As such, under the direction of the proposed Specific Aims we expect to delineate the mechanisms underlying mitochondrial mutagenesis in normal and tumor cells, and exploit these for use in the clinic. For the first Aim, we propose to delineate the relationships and among metabolism, ROS, mtDNA mutagenesis, and apoptotic priming by testing the hypothesis that mtDNA mutagenesis mediates apoptotic response. Secondly, we will establish whether mtDNA mutagenesis is predictive of treatment response and thus can serve as a specific, prognostic biomarker of pathological response (pCR) to neoadjuvant treatment in locally advanced breast cancer (LABC). Lastly, we will determine if mitochondrial- targeted cancer therapeutics, focused on directly increasing OXPHOS, will promote apoptotic response and sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapeutically-induced apoptosis. Successful completion of the proposed project Aims will: (1) Establish a cause and effect relationship between glucose metabolism and apoptotic resistance; (2) Advance understanding of relationships between mtDNA mutagenesis, cell metabolism, and cancer; (3) Determine the utility of mitochondrial mutagenesis as a predictive biomarker of treatment response, early relapse, and death; (4) Explore the utility of a novel chemotherapeutic strategy that increases mitochondrial respiration; and (5) ultimately improve cancer prognostication and treatment, thereby improving patient outcomes and quality of life."
"9223589","Project Summary/Abstract  The goal of this proposal is to extend my training as an independent scientist in the field of molecular hepatology and discover mechanisms of nuclear receptor regulation of hepatic metabolism. To this end, I have selected the Molecular and Cellular Biology Department at Baylor College of Medicine to continue my transition to become an independent investigator at an academic institution. This proposal outlines an extensive Research Strategy that is complemented by several areas of training, which includes several courses directly related to my studies in Specific Aim 1, meeting with my junior faculty research committee, and attendance and participation of multiple seminars throughout the Texas Medical Center. My Research Strategy will determine whole genomic-changes in nuclear receptor binding in a Wilson's disease animal model (Atp7b-/- mouse). Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by loss of function mutations in the Cu- transporting P-type ATPase, ATP7b, which results in a variety of symptoms, including hepatic copper accumulation, cholestasis, cirrhosis, liver failure, and neurological dysfunction. Treatments for Wilson's disease are limited to chelation therapy, zinc therapy, or liver transplantation. Chelation therapy has been associated with several side-effects and poor patient compliance, and uncontrolled Wilson's disease can result in liver failure and requires liver transplantation for patient survival. Despite the severity of Wilson's disease, insights regarding copper-mediated changes in metabolism are limited. My post-doctoral studies established a defect in nuclear receptor activity in the Atp7b-/- mouse and Wilson's disease patients. The proposed K01 experiments continue those studies to determine the broader changes in nuclear receptor promoter occupancy and target gene mRNA expression, as well as test if targeting the nuclear receptors decreases the liver pathology observed in the Atp7b-/- mouse."
"9308667","Abstract Alzheimer's disease is a fatal, progressive brain disease that deteriorates memory and cognitive ability, often starting years before the first symptoms appear. It is the most common form of dementia and the only top 10 cause of death that has no cure, no means of prevention, and no disease-modifying treatments. In this proposal we suggest a combination of novel nanostructure assembly technique based on Flexible Nano Arrays (FNA) and universal non-self vaccine platform MultiTEP for the creation of an efficient AD vaccine targeting A? dimers. This vaccine would be able to discriminate between pathological and physiological as well as toxic and inert forms of A?. This becomes especially important in the light of new evidence suggesting the functional importance of A? in neuronal plasticity and defense against brain infections. Ability to target selectively highly toxic soluble forms of A? is also important, since generation of antibodies that bind to mostly inert, fibrillar forms of A? is suboptimal due to the possibility of solubilization of plaques and release of large amounts of toxic soluble A? oligomers. Also, targeting the fibrillary forms of A? may lead to increased activation of complement in the regions with vascular amyloid deposits and induce additional adverse effects associated with vascular inflammation. The oligomeric forms of A? are highly neurotoxic and should be the primary target in AD immunotherapy, yet their structure is not well-defined and is mostly predicted based on the knowledge about the structure of fibrillar A?. Synthetic oligomeric forms of A? are transient and heterogeneous in size, therefore we hypothesize that a successful immunotherapy approach for AD needs well-defined antigens. The objective of this proposal is to develop an approach by which a flexible nanoarray will be utilized to assemble dimers of A?14-23 peptide and conjugate them with the universal and immunogenic MultiTEP platform to generate a novel vaccine targeting dimeric A?, which is considered to be a seed for the generation of other toxic forms of A?. The immunogenic efficacy and specificity of the vaccine will be tested in vivo allowing us to optimize the vaccine assembly methodology. We hypothesize that (a) combining conformational B cell epitope/s exposed on A?14-23 dimers with MultiTEP platform (dA?-MultiTEP) will allow us to generate an effective vaccine, which, after formulation in proprietary Advax/CpG adjuvant, will overcome immunogenicity limitation even in elderly people with immunosenescence; (b) dimer-specific antibodies will not only be therapeutically effective, but also safe, due to the absence of adverse events associated with solubilization of plaques and clearance of monomeric A?."
"9294587","Project Summary  Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that is inhaled into the lungs and can disseminate to the brain, causing a highly fatal meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with AIDS, solid organ transplants, and cancer. Despite contemporary combination antifungal therapy, the survival rate for cryptococcosis approaches only 70%, and the at-risk population is expanding with the development of new immunosuppressive regimens for autoimmunity and cancer. Currently, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate the mammalian immune response to C. neoformans are poorly defined.  The candidate, Dr. Lena J. Heung, proposes a career development training program that will give her the knowledge and technical skills necessary to investigate the immune mechanisms of inflammatory monocytes in a murine model of pulmonary cryptococcosis. She has demonstrated that inflammatory monocytes play a detrimental role during the host response to C. neoformans by promoting fungal proliferation and eosinophil recruitment in the lung that ultimately lead to death. The aims of the project are to (1) evaluate how C. neoformans subverts inflammatory monocytes to promote fungal proliferation and (2) evaluate how inflammatory monocyte signaling pathways and cellular crosstalk disrupt anti-cryptoccocal immune responses. By using unique murine models and immunologic techniques to manipulate monocyte-specific functions, the proposed studies will determine if C. neoformans induces inflammatory monocytes to differentiate into cells that can be exploited as fungal reservoirs for dissemination and if C. neoformans-induced pulmonary eosinophilia is a pathologic process regulated by inflammatory monocytes through the signaling adapter DAP12 and cellular crosstalk with eosinophils. Defining these mechanisms will deepen our understanding of the signals that regulate pulmonary immunity to opportunistic fungi and inform novel opportunities for immunomodulatory interventions against cryptococcosis in vulnerable hosts.  The proposed training will take place at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, an institution that incorporates expertise from diverse scientific and clinical fields into an integrated research environment. The candidate will complete didactic and practical bench training in immunology with the guidance of an advisory committee composed of leading researchers in the field. Given her training as an Infectious Diseases physician and her PhD experience studying regulatory mechanisms of cryptococcal virulence, the candidate will develop a unique skill set that will enable her to tackle long-standing problems in medical mycology from a new perspective in order to create innovate solutions. Thus, at the end of the period of support, she will be poised to undertake a career as an independent physician-scientist in the field of fungal immunology."
"9405163","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs), which provide the deoxynucleotide precursors for DNA synthesis by reducing the corresponding ribonucleotides, are divided into three classes on the basis of the cofactor that initiates catalysis. Historically, class I, which comprises the RNRs from aerobic bacteria such as Escherichia coli (Ec) and higher eukaryotes including humans, is further subdivided into three subclasses that are distinguished, in part, by the identity of the dimetal cofactor (Fe2, Mn2, and MnFe for subclasses a, b, and c, respectively) in the ? subunit that either directly or indirectly generates a consered cysteine radical (Cys?) initiator in the a subunit. It has been established for the archetypal clss Ia Ec RNR that Cys? generation occurs by a conformationally gated, long distance proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism, and important details of this step have been defined. The research plan herein aims to elucidate the PCET mechanisms in the Ib and Ic RNRs at an equivalent level of detail. This goal will be achieved through trapping strategies that permit the PCET product state to be compared to the resting (reactant) state by Mössbauer, electron paramagnetic resonance, and magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopic techniques. In addition, our preliminary evidence suggests the existence of a previously unrecognized, fourth subclass (class Id), in which the cofactor's composition, structure, and mechanism of Cys? generation remain to be determined. As even a basic understanding of the class Id RNRs is lacking, multi-turnover kinetic assays will be optimized for this enzyme class, and used in conjunction with single-turnover experiments and spectroscopic analysis of cofactor composition to identify the functional cofactor. PCET reactant and product states of the active cofactor will b interrogated crystallographically and spectroscopically to define their structures and the mechanism of radical initiation. Here again, trapping strategies employing site-directed mutagenesis, chemical reductants, and/or mechanism-based inactivators will enable preparation of the PCET product state both to identify the functional cofactor and define its structure."

"9204835","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Four neural structures in the Drosophila optic lobes (lamina, medulla, lobula and lobula complex) sequentially process visual information through neural networks of specialized cell types organized in a retinotopic manner. We will continue our investigations to understand how neuronal diversity is generated in the developing optic lobes, which are comprised of more than 100 cell types. Our observations suggest that neuronal specification in the medulla results from the integration of three mechanisms: (i) 800 neuroblasts express a sequence of temporal transcription factors to generate distinct types of neurons as they age, each contacting one of the 800 columns innervated by photoreceptors. (ii) The temporal series is modified locally by regional transcription factors and produces neurons that innervate multiple columns. (iii) Binary fate choice via Notch further diversifies daughters of the terminal cell division. In the posterior-most region of the developing medulla and in the progenitor region of the lobula complex, neurogenesis differs significantly with a different set of transcription factors that act not only to specify neuronal fate but also to control the precursor mode of division and the death or survival of neurons. This illustrates how complex brain structures use different strategies to adapt and produce the correct number of specific cell types with the appropriate characteristics. We will investigate the mechanisms controlling this neurogenesis. Aim 1: Temporal progression of neuroblasts: Timing and transition mechanisms Temporal patterning is a general mechanism to generate neural diversity in flies and vertebrates. We will explore the molecular processes controlling the temporal progression of neuroblasts in the medulla. Aim 2. Regionalization of the medulla neuroepithelium and specialization of neuroblasts We will investigate the rules that modify the output of the temporal series in different regions of the medulla progenitor domain. This allows the local production of neurons that migrate to occupy the entire medulla. Aim 3. Correlation between transcription factor expression and neuronal characteristics To understand how transcription networks control the characteristics of neurons, we will use large-scale single cell transcriptomics to identify regulatory interactions and determine how these define the identity of each neuron. Aim 4. Regulation of the mode of neuroblast division and neuronal survival or death by temporal patterning We will investigate how temporal transcription factors act on the cell cycle and on pro-apoptotic genes to characterize the different strategies used by distinct parts of the optic lobes to produce specialized neurons. Aim 5. Temporal patterning-independent neurogenesis in lobula complex progenitors We will explore the molecular mechanisms that control a different mode of neurogenesis that produces 3 types of lobula neurons without a temporal series by controlling the rapid exit of neuroblasts from proliferation. This ambitious work will allow us to identify basic principles of neural patterning and diversity generation, which have broad implications for other neuronal systems in flies and vertebrates."
"9211375","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Over 1 million Americans suffer a myocardial infarction (MI) each year and many experience post-MI left ventricular (LV) remodeling, which is manifest as progressive changes in LV structure and function. Post-MI LV remodeling is responsible for nearly 70% of all heart failure (HF) cases. HF severely disables 5 million Americans and kills more than 250,000 each year. The proposed project is based on a highly significant translational research approach that seeks to develop a clinically applicable, minimally invasive treatment strategy focused on the newly formed MI intended to interrupt LV remodeling and prevent the development of symptomatic HF. Infarct expansion (stretching) results from progressive changes in MI material properties and has been identified as the biomechanical phenomena that initiates and sustains adverse LV remodeling. The proposed project will build on and advance our previously completed work, which demonstrated that preventing infarct expansion by surgically placed restraint devices significantly reduces LV remodeling. The overarching goal of this project is to establish that targeted delivery of novel biomaterials that have been engineered to induce a phenotypic shift in responding macrophages from the M1 (proteolytic) phenotype to the M2 (reparative) phenotype, will promote extracellular matrix (ECM) stability, favorably alter infarct material properties, limit infarct expansion and improve LV remodeling. In Specific Aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that targeted delivery of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) into the infarct region by a hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel carrier shifts responding macrophage polarization in favor of the M2 phenotype, which promotes ECM stability, favorably alters infarct material properties, limits infarct expansion and improves LV remodeling. In Specific Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that the targeted delivery to the infarct region of PLGA microspheres and MCP-1 in a HA-hydrogel carrier will synergistically potentiate both macrophage polarization in favor of the M2 phenotype and ECM stability further reducing infarct expansion and limiting LV remodeling when compared to PLGA microspheres or MCP-1 delivery alone. The significance of the proposed project is further enhanced by the use of a clinically relevant large animal MI model and the application in Specific Aim 3 of minimally invasive catheter-based epicardial approaches for biomaterial delivery guided by state-of-the-art electroanatomic infarct mapping. Both of which heighten the potential for rapid clinical translation of the proposed work."
"9239633","Project Summary (Abstract) The overall goal of the proposed study is to delineate consequences and determinants of adolescent marijuana (MJ) consumption using the co-twin control approach. MJ is the most commonly used illicit drug with a typical onset of use in adolescence, a period of continued brain development and increased vulnerability to detrimental effects of drugs of abuse. Previous studies have established associations between chronic and/or early MJ exposure and alterations in brain function, behavior, and cognition, including deficits in self-regulation of behavior and increased impulsivity that may increase the risk for transition to the use of ?harder? drugs, as well as neurocognitive dysfunctions that resemble those seen in schizophrenia. However, most existing studies relied on case-control, correlational designs precluding strong causal inferences. It remains unclear whether deficits found in MJ users represent the consequences of MJ use or, conversely, pre- existing factors of risk for MJ use. This unresolved issue represents a critical gap in knowledge that hinders the development of prevention, intervention, and treatment methods, as well as evidence-based MJ related public policy. The proposed study seeks to address this gap in knowledge through the implementation of the powerful co-twin control design. In monozygotic twin pairs discordant for MJ use history, twins have the same degree of genetic liability and share many critical aspects of environment but differ with respect to MJ exposure. Thus, the non-exposed twins represent ideal controls for their MJ-exposed co-twins. The co-twin control method is thus a cost- and time-efficient approach that can be viewed as complimentary to longitudinal studies that require very large samples to ensure sufficient representation of high-exposure cases and long time (about 10 years) to achieve conclusive results. The proposed study will use a set of theory-driven experimental paradigms to collect neurophysiological, behavioral, and cognitive measures that tap into specific neurocognitive component processes that have been linked to (i) impulsivity and addiction risk (response inhibition, error monitoring, and selective attention) and/or (ii) increased risk for schizophrenia (sensory and sensorimotor gating, auditory deviance detection). These measures will be assessed in 280 adolescent and young adult twins with and without MJ use history aged 19-36. The twins will be drawn from existing epidemiological studies of the PI and co-investigators and selected, based on existing data, to ensure sufficient variability in the age of onset, extent of exposure, length of abstinence, and twin pair concordance versus discordance for MJ use. Specific aims will be: 1) To examine associations between MJ use and neurocognitive functioning in adolescents and young adults and to determine the extent to which these associations depend on severity of exposure, age of onset of MJ use, and length of abstinence and 2) To isolate, using co-twin control approach, consequences of MJ use from pre-existing alterations in brain function and cognition."
"9207454","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal regulation of glycemia (dysglycemia) has a very long time course, from its earliest stage, labeled pre-diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The 11-year follow-up DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the relatively brief 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Prevention was cost-saving with MET and cost-effective with ILS. Overall, the risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (A1C). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those who had A1C ?6.5% at study end.  The proposed DPPOS Phase 3 will study the DPPOS cohort for 10 more years, taking advantage of the long-term randomized exposure to MET and the densely phenotyped and genotyped DPPOS cohort (n=2778), which includes nearly 1600 patients with known T2D duration and ~1200 who have not developed T2D, to address yet unanswered questions about long-term exposure to MET and ILS initiated during pre-diabetes. DPPOS Phase 3 will examine outcomes that are of increasing public health concern in the aging population with pre-diabetes and T2D, including the putative benefits of MET on development of CVD and cancer. The main goals of DPPOS Phase 3 are to examine efficiently: 1) the long-term effects of metformin therapy begun in the pre-diabetic phase on risk for CVD and cancer; 2) the long-term effects by intention-to-treat of ILS and MET on further development of T2D and on traditional and more recently recognized complications of dysglycemia, and of their economic impact; and 3) the clinical course of dysglycemia, evaluated by categorical diagnoses (pre-diabetes vs diabetes) and as a continuum, and their associations with the development of complications, including analyses of interactions with DPP interventions and established and novel risk factors."
"9257949","PROJECT SUMMARY The immune system plays a critical role in human health by sensing and destroying foreign invaders such as viruses, bacterium, parasites, and other sources of infection. Activating the immune response can help fight off a range of diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, and cancer. Conversely, inhibiting the immune response can help treat autoimmune diseases such as diabetes, arthritis, and atherosclerosis. As such, there has been significant and growing interest in developing new therapeutics for regulating the immune response, both in stimulating or suppressing it, to treat a wide variety of human diseases. One particular area of interest lies in the development of Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists. TLRs are a well-studied family of pattern recognition receptors that stimulate the innate immune response when activated by the appropriate agonist. However, most TLR agonist-based therapeutics are not selective for which physiological regions are immunologically stimulated. TLR activity and the ensuing immune response may thus occur indiscriminately, leading to inflammation responses at undesired physiological sites, which can lead to disease exacerbation. Synthetically engineering the TLR agonist so that its primary release occurs specifically at disease sites may potentially increase immunotherapeutic potency while also reducing unwanted inflammation at healthy locations. The driving hypothesis of this proposal is to determine whether TLR agonists can be caged so that they are immunologically inactive until they detect specific bioanalytes, at which point they will self-immolate to release the free agonists and stimulate the immune response. The ability to cage and release TLR agonists was demonstrated previously by Esser-Kahn and coworkers, who utilized directed UV light to release TLR agonists and stimulate innate immune cells. We will use similar tools and metrics (NF-?B activity, cytokine and cell surface marker production, confocal microscopy) to characterize immune cell activation here, but exploit the local chemistry at the disease site to achieve higher specificity over uncaged therapeutics. The specific aims of this proposal that we will use to validate our hypothesis are to establish cage-and-release systems that are triggered by two specific bioanalytes: (a) the ferrous ion (Fe2+), and (b) hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). These bioanalytes were selected under the guiding principle that cancer cells contain severely elevated levels of both these species. However, our therapeutic strategy should be applicable to other disease states that involve dysregulated iron metabolism or generate high levels of H2O2. We will study the immune response in RAW- blue 264.7 macrophage reporters and primary dendritic cells that have been exposed to varying levels of Fe2+ and H2O2. Upon detecting these bioanalytes, the cage will fall apart and the immunotherapeutic payload will be released. If our hypothesis is validated, our findings may establish TLR agonists as therapeutics that can initiate immune responses at specific locations or under specific disease conditions (high levels of Fe2+ or H2O2), leading to enhanced cell-mediated immunity and enabling more potent and directed therapeutics."
"9206983","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Antibiotic-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, including carbapenem-resistant and extended spectrum ?-lactamase producing Klebsiella spp., Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter spp. are considered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to be urgent and serious health threats to the United States. Our long term goal is to develop and evaluate novel antibiotics for the Enterobacteriaceae. We will attain our goal with nanoparticle and dendrimeric siderophore plugs. Siderophores are powerful iron chelators synthesized and excreted by microorganisms to sequester and return the iron needed for their growth. All Enterobacteriaceae rely primarily on the siderophore enterobactin for their iron acquisition. Because iron is a limiting factor in bacterial growth in the human body (includin on skin and in blood, urine and cerebrospinal fluid), this siderophore has long been established as a virulence factor for all Enterobacteriaceae. Increased expression of the outer-membrane siderophore receptors for enterobactin, FepA, has been repeatedly observed during infection with all the virulent strains of the Enterobacteriaceae. Our central hypothesis is that siderophore anchors that block the siderophore transport systems of the Enterobacteriaceae will significantly reduce the virulence of the bacteria by starving it. The overall objective of this application is t synthesize and evaluate a new family of enterobactin plugs as antibiotics for the treatment of the Enterobacteriaceae. The rationale for the proposed research is that the availability of more powerful antibiotics and antibiotics with novel modes of actions is necessary to treat increasingly prevalent bacterial pathogens that are resistant to current drugs. We plan to accomplish our objectives by pursuing the following Specific Aims: 1) Synthesize enterobactin plugs that block the FepA receptor; and 2) Evaluate the potential of enterobactin plugs as antibiotics. This research is significant because it aims to develop a new class of antibiotics that exploits a novel mechanism of action and that targets microorganisms, which present urgent and serious threats, that are resistant to current classes of antibiotics. Our approach is innovative because we are exploiting the siderophore receptor itself as a target for antibiotics with novel mechanisms of actions. The transporters involved in the uptake of iron themselves have not yet been evaluated as targets for antibiotics."

"9258932","PROJECT SUMMARY  This F30 application is for support of Morgan Locy's MD/PhD training. Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a chronic, progressive lung disorder that results in loss of functional alveolar-capillary units leading to impaired gas exchange and respiratory failure. The number of individuals with interstitial lung disease (ILD) in the United States is estimated at 500,000 with increasing incidence and prevalence. About 40% of diagnoses of ILD are idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) with this population having particularly high mortality and morbidity with a five-year mortality rate of 50-70%. IPF is a disease of aging with features of aberrant wound healing. Oxidative stress has been implicated in IPF pathogenesis, and ?signatures? of chronic oxidative damage observed in lung tissue from IPF patients. Our lab has shown that NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) producing enzyme, is upregulated in the lung of IPF patients; the pro-fibrotic cytokine, transforming growth factor-?1 (TGF-?1), upregulates NOX4-dependent H2O2 production. We recently reported that o,o'-dityrosine levels, a covalent tyrosine modification catalyzed by H2O2 and a heme peroxidase (hPx), are increased in proteins within the circulating plasma of ILD patients. This increase in plasma levels of this oxidative biomarker was also replicated in a murine model of lung injury and fibrosis. The identity of the hPx or the enzymatic source of H2O2 in the context of ILD and experimental lung fibrosis is not known. Mechanisms of the formation of protein-associated o,o'-dityrosine and how it contributes to disease pathogenesis is also unknown. I have observed that the ECM protein, fibronectin (FN), undergoes o,o'-dityrosine cross-linking. FN is known to play a central role in physiologic and pathologic wound healing. Further understanding the modulation of FN by o,o'-dityrosine cross-linking could provide novel insights into normal wound healing and the dysregulation that occurs in pathologic states of aberrant wound healing. The central hypothesis for these studies is that the hPx, myeloperoxidase (MPO), and NOX4-dependent H2O2 generate o,o'-dityrosine in an in vivo lung injury model; additionally, FN o,o'-dityrosine cross-linking alters its function/stability in in vitro cell models. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the mediators of o,o'-dityrosine formation and its effect on physiologic and pathologic wound healing in the lung. This understanding will guide strategies for the development of novel therapeutics in the setting of aberrant wound healing seen in ILD.  This proposal will provide a solid training platform for Morgan Locy (PI) under the mentorship of Dr. Victor Thannickal (sponsor) that will foster his career development as an astute and creative physician-scientist."
"9241611","PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal is designed to prepare the candidate for an independent academic career in clinical and translational research. The candidate?s long term goal is to discover innovative solutions for children with biliary atresia and other liver diseases. The candidate has PhD training in basic science research, and he cares for patients in a stimulating environment that exposes him to the full spectrum of pediatric liver disorders. Now the candidate seeks formal training in clinical and translational research techniques, to allow him to synthesize clinical observations and patient data and develop novel diagnostic, treatment, and prevention strategies. The immediate goals of this project are threefold: 1) Acquire clinical and translational research skills through formal coursework, research experience, and  mentor-guided instruction; 2) Develop ideas for future research, which can serve as the basis for a R03 or R01 grant application to  initiate an independent career; and 3) Learn analytical, communication, and decision-making skills from an accomplished mentor, whose  successful career path in pediatric hepatology will serve as a template. To accomplish this, the candidate has created a rigorous career developmental plan to occur concurrently while assessing a novel newborn screen for biliary atresia (BA). BA is a serious liver condition with significant morbidity and mortality, and is the leading indication for pediatric liver transplantation in the US. If BA is diagnosed and treated early, infants with disease can delay or even avoid need for liver transplantation; however, infants are often diagnosed later because the disease is difficult to recognize in the first weeks of life. Previously, the candidate observed that infants with BA have elevated direct or conjugated bilirubin levels at birth, and proposed that this simple test could be used to screen newborns for disease. The career development plan will equip the candidate with the necessary knowledge and skills to fully assess newborn direct/conjugated bilirubin screening for BA. The candidate will learn how to conduct multi-center studies and interpret large amounts of population data, by screening 102,000 newborns from 10 different birth hospitals. The candidate will also take formal coursework to learn the theory and practice of cost-effective studies, and then create sophisticated models simulating outcomes with and without screening which also incorporate the screen?s associated costs. Finally, the candidate will learn specialized techniques in the clinical chemistry laboratory and how to evaluate their utility, in the context of testing whether blood spot samples can be used for the BA screening test. At the conclusion of the training period, the candidate should be well trained to address complex problems in pediatric hepatology at a clinical and translational research level. He should have many potential avenues of further investigation, including characterizing the early stages of biliary atresia, generating efficient algorithms for diagnosing biliary atreia, testing blood spot samples on a large scale from state newborn screening laboratories, and potentially implementing a universal newborn screening program for BA at the national level. He will also have benefitted from years of close instruction by a proven leader in the field. These experiences should prepare the candidate to apply for independent funding, and help launch his research career as a successful physician scientist focused on improving the lives of children with liver diseases."
"9207085","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Prostate cancer is the most prevalent diagnosed disease among men in the United States. Currently diagnosis is achieved through assessment of multiple data including PSA blood levels and digital rectal exams. Since the introduction of PSA testing significantly more men have been diagnosed and treated for the disease. The course of therapeutic action for diagnosed prostate cancer depends on staging of the disease and breaks down to essentially 3 interventions depending on stage: 1) Radical prostatectomy for cancers that are contained within the prostate; 2) Radiation therapy which can be used for both early and more advanced cancer; and 3) Watchful waiting, or active surveillance. With current screening and public awareness approximately 91% of prostate cancers detected are estimated to be clinically localized when first detected and potentially these patients are candidates for surgery, which is only used for localized disease. However, there is no way to know with certainty if the cancer is localized within the prostate capsule during surgery, and, of the patients that undergo radical prostatectomy, approximately 20% do not achieve surgical cures because of disease spread outside of the prostate gland. Moreover, surgery is associated with significant morbidities including incontinence and erectile dysfunction. The need to perform more complete prostatectomies and reduce surgical morbidities defines an unmet clinical need. The development of a technology that would improve the ability of the surgeon to distinguish among these structures, assess extra-capsular invasion of the cancer during prostatectomy, improve surgical decisions, and ablate cancer tissue that is not resectable, would improve quality of care. We propose to use a highly selective prostate biomarker, PSMA, to drive the binding of a targeted theranostic nanoparticle agent to prostate cancer. This nanoparticle contains a photodynamic therapeutic agent, Pc4 that is both fluorescent and a potent cancer therapeutic. The goal of the proposed studies is to derivatize the nanoparticle containing Pc4 with a ligand for PSMA, thusly driving its selective uptake and delivery of Pc4 into prostate tumors. During surgery the fluorescent aspects of Pc4 would be exploited to visually differentiate the tumor from surrounding normal tissues, which do not take up the nanoparticle. This would allow the surgeon to decide in real time how aggressive the surgical intervention need be, i.e. the degree of morbidity potentially incurred to fully remove diseased tissues. Upon completion of the surgical resection, light of a specific wavelength can be used to excite the Pc4 resulting in free radical generation and robust cancer killing of the remaining cancer tissues that were not removed by the surgical procedure."
"9402354","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-throughput sequencing (HTS) data on the genomes of a diverse number of species are being produced at an unprecedented rate. However, the development of computational and statistical approaches for handling these data lags behind, creating a gap between the massive data being generated and the biological knowledge that could be gleaned. Here we propose to develop an integrated system for genetic variation detection, annotation and analysis for HTS data, therefore reducing the critical gap faced by the community. In Aim 1, we will develop a hidden Markov model (HMM) based computational algorithm that incorporates multiple sources of information, including sequence depth, allelic dosage, population allele frequency and paired-end reads distance, for reliable yet efficient detection of copy number variations (CNVs). Given a large list of SNPs, indels and CNVs, researchers are faced with the challenge of identifying a subset of functionally important variants. In Aim 2, we will develop a comprehensive functional annotation pipeline to annotate functional importance of coding and non-coding variants, utilizing database information from many large-scale genomics projects, and generate a functional vector for each variant. These functional vectors can help biologists interpret sequencing results and help statistical geneticists develop informed association tests using sequencing data. Appropriate statistical methods are needed to analyze population-level sequencing data, in order to identify genomic variants that may contribute to disease susceptibility or phenotypic variability. In Aim 3, we will develop a hierarchical modeling strategy, which utilizes functional vector information for each variant, to perform association tests on genes, genomic regions, or biological pathways, such as ontology categories and gene regulatory/metabolic pathways. Finally, in Aim 4, we will test the properties of each approach via simulation and real data analysis, and develop, distribute and support freely available software packages implementing the proposed methods. We believe that well-documented and supported software implementations will allow other researchers to yield the maximum information from the methodological and scientific advances that result from this project. Successful completion of the aims will enable researchers to fully investigate the massive amounts of sequencing data that have been or will be generated, thus contributing to our understanding on how genetic variants influence phenotype variability."
"9208136","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): At the leading edge membrane of a migrating cell, three membrane-associated master kinases (PKC?, PI3K?, PDK1) together play a central role in controlling the signaling pathway that regulates chemotaxis up attractant gradients. The present project has provided fundamental insights into key membrane targeting reactions, triggered by local Ca2+ and PIP3 signals, that recruit these and other signaling proteins to the leading edge membrane. The resulting membrane-localized signaling network controls cell migration.  New studies will focus on the three master kinases and their membrane-based signaling reactions. These studies will elucidate the activation mechanisms of individual kinases and define the pathway connections between them. The lipid bilayer itself is a crucial element of the signaling pathway - the bilayer surface serves as a 2-dimensional scaffold and diffusion platform on which recruited proteins (a) collide with and bind membrane-bound activators and substrates, (b) carry out signaling reactions, and, in some cases (c) combine with other membrane proteins to form higher order signaling complexes.  The new Specific Aims investigate the activation mechanisms and regulatory interactions of the three master kinases on planar bilayers. Initial work will analyze each individual membrane-bound kinase to under- stand the sequence of molecular steps leading to kinase activation. Longer term studies will reconstitute all three kinases with their membrane-bound activators and substrates, enabling direct analysis of signal trans- mission and regulatory interactions between membrane-bound components. The project has three Aims:     Aim 1. Delineate the molecular steps by which multiple lipids and activators switch on PKC?.     Aim 2. Elucidate the mechanisms by which lipids, proteins, and oncogenic mutations activate PI3K?. Aim 3. Define the interactions between kinases that establish pathway connections and activate PDK1.  Completion of the Aims will reveal fundamental molecular principles underlying the activation, signal propagation, and feedback connections of the three master kinases, with major impacts for signaling at the leading edge and diverse areas of signaling biology. Furthermore, each targeted master kinase is directly linked to human cancers and inflammatory disease, thus a mechanistic understanding of kinase activation is medically relevant and could facilitate the development of new therapies."
"9246182","PROJECT SUMMARY  Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is remarkable for exceptionally high metastatic potential, initial robust response to DNA damaging agents, and near universal development of resistance. This combination of predilection for early metastasis acquired treatment resistance ? often times manifested as cross resistance to multiple agents ? highlights a critical need for novel systemic therapies operating through a novel mechanism in order to achieve improved patient outcomes.  Delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3), has recently been identified as a therapeutic target in SCLC. The highly tumor-selective surface expression of this protein make it an excellent candidate target for an antibody drug conjugate (ADC). Rovalpituzumab tesserine (Rova-T) is one such ADC that is showing encouraging efficacy signals in the clinic. However, despite apparent clinical benefit, this agent has also been associated with some severe adverse events attributable to the presence of the anthracycline PBD warhead. DLL3 targeting approaches are in need of both a real-time, quantitative diagnostic biomarker and a therapeutic approach with reduced toxicity.  We propose a theranostic approach comprising on 89Zr immunoPET and a 90Y/177Lu radioimmunotherapeutic. The first Aim improves upon already promising bioconjugation chemistry. We are already able to obtain high-contrast immunoPET images using non-specific amine labeling and site-specific maleimide bioconjugation. We will improve upon this approach by developing more stable thiol-clickable methylsuflone chelators for 89Zr and 90Y/177Lu to minimize kidney dose. The second Aim identifies preclinical dosing parameters and comprehensively optimizes efficacy and toxicity in a traditional cell line xenograft. Our preliminary imaging data is focused on H82, an SCLC cell lined derived from a chemoexperienced patient. This cell line is very resistant to etoposide in vitro and in vivo and will be used to identify a radiotherapy dose that demonstrates efficacy in vivo, while minimizing dose to the kidney. Different dose ranges and schedules will be explored. The final Aim explores radiotherapy in a variety of in vivo contexts including lesion sizes ranging from 0.1 to 10 mm in diameter and representing both chemonaïve and chemoresistant disease. Radioisotopes have different energy deposition depending on the volume of the tumor being targeted. We will evaluate 90Y and 177Lu radioisotopes in different in vivo models of small cell lung cancer for the ability to eradicate lesions of different sizes. A unique resource in the lab is our collection of 10 paired chemonaïve and chemoresistant patient-derived xenograft lines. We will place particular emphasis on establishing efficacy in the context of acquired chemoresistance.  Data obtained in this study should provide preclinical evidence in support of clinical translation of a DLL3 targeting theranostic based on rovalpituzumab."
"9405709","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative bacterium that colonizes the gastric mucosa of humans. Although most H. pylori-infected persons remain asymptomatic, potentially serious sequelae of infection include gastric adenocarcinoma, duodenal or gastric ulceration, and gastric lymphoma. Gastric cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and H. pylori has been classified as a type I carcinogen by the World Health Organization. One of the most important virulence factors of H. pylori is a protein known as CagA. CagA is secreted through a type IV secretion system (T4SS) and enters gastric epithelial cells, where it causes a complex set of alterations in cellular signaling that are associated with malignant transformation. CagA and components of the T4SS are encoded by genes within a chromosomal region known as the cag pathogenicity island (PAI), which is present in some H. pylori strains but not others. The incidence of symptomatic gastroduodenal disease (gastric cancer or peptic ulceration) is higher among persons infected with cag PAI-positive strains than among persons infected with cag PAI-negative strains. The effects of CagA on host cells have been studied in great detail, but thus far there has been only limited study of CagA secretion. The T4SS used for CagA secretion exhibits unique and specialized features that differ from those of well-studied T4SSs used for mobilization of DNA. The overarching long-term goals of this research are to develop a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which H. pylori causes gastric disease, and to determine why gastric disease arises in a small subset of infected persons while most remain asymptomatic or derive health benefits. The aims of the project are i) To define the molecular organization of the membrane-spanning cag T4SS core complex; ii) To determine the three-dimensional structure of the cag T4SS core complex; and (iii) To define consequences of T4SS activity in animal models of H. pylori infection and gastric malignancy. Methods will include robust electron microscopy approaches for analyzing the structure of the T4SS core complex, specialized techniques for genetic manipulation in H. pylori, and newly developed methods for regulating the transcription of genes encoding T4SS components. These studies should provide important advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which H. pylori infection can lead to gastric cancer and other gastric diseases. On a broader scope, these studies will increase our understanding of bacterial secretion systems and the delivery of virulence factors into host cells, as well as molecular mechanisms underlying microbe-induced carcinogenesis."
"9102587","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Excessive alcohol consumption and illicit drug use are leading causes of death in the United States. Because a great majority of individuals with substance use disorders (SUDs) receive no treatment for their addictions, increasing SUD treatment access is one of the great public health challenges facing the US health care system. A project is proposed to evaluate the effects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) on rates of Medicaid and private health insurance enrollment as well as SUD treatment among adults with SUDs. The results will help state and federal health care policy makers gauge the early effects of the ACA on SUD treatment patterns and focus policies and programs on groups who have persistently low levels of health insurance and high levels of unmet need for SUD treatment.  The specific aims of the project are to: 1) assess change in Medicaid and private insurance enrollment following ACA implementation among adults with SUDs; 2) determine whether among adults with SUDs, the ACA Medicaid expansion and private insurance subsidy provisions are associated with increases in SUD treatment and whether such increases are mediated by Medicaid and private insurance enrollment; and 3) explore associations between ACA implementation and likelihood of receiving specific SUD treatment services, sustained treatment, and treatment for alcohol and drug use disorders.  We will address these aims by merging data from 1) the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2010-2017), an annual face-to-face survey of approximately 70,000 state and national representative respondents that includes in depth information on the prevalence and treatment of SUDs; 2) the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services that includes detailed information on substance abuse treatment service capacity at the county level; 3) federal block grant funding levels to the states for substance abuse treatment and prevention services; 4) county resource characteristics from the Area Resource File; and 5) state-level participation in the ACA Medicaid expansion. A well-established conceptual model will guide selection of need, predisposing, and enabling control variables at the individual, county, and state levels. The analytic plan will model ACA implementation in a manner that is sensitive to ACA implementation period and target population of the ACA provisions by separately considering their effects on poor/near poor adults and middle income adults with SUDs.  This project will generate a national assessment of the early effects of ACA on health insurance enrollment and treatment of adults with SUDs. In addition to the effects of the ACA on overall SUD treatment, the project will yield vital new information on how the legislation has influenced use of specialty  inpatient and outpatient services, general outpatient services, and acute services for SUDs and its effects on populations of special interest including low income persons, young adults, females, and ethnic/racial minorities."

Graduate students are selected from among the Molecular and Developmental Biology (MDB) Graduate Program matriculants with interest in birth defects and/or neurobehavioral effects of prenatal origin.  MDB students take core classes in developmental biology, molecular genetics, cell biology, biochemistry, and ethics in research; teratology students additionally take courses in teratology, biostatistics, and toxicology (recommended). Neuroteratology students additionally take courses in neuroscience.  Postdoctoral trainees take the teratology and ethics in research courses.  Postdoctoral trainees enter the Training Program by applying directly to training faculty members.  All training faculty operate active, extramurall funded laboratories and all have experience training graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Current and past trainees show excellent research productivity, all attend national meetings annually, and all have secured good positions upon completion.  All trainees in the last 10 years have remained in science; many have entered the private sector thereby helping to fill the national shortage of teratologists in industry.  Four pre-doctoral and three postdoctoral positions are requested.  During the current funding period, the program has had additional success attracting URM trainees; in addition, curriculum changes have strengthened training in molecular genetics, developmental biology, and developmental diseases; a new research building and core facilities became available and the MDB faculty has expanded to 85, with the training grant faculty expanding to 15, 5 of whom are new to the grant.  More training investigators now investigate environmental agents than 5 years ago. This program fills a unique niche as the only NIEHS training grant in teratology, the only one with a molecular genetics emphasis, and the only one with major focus on brain development. Teratology is not a specialty with its own academic home; accordingly, training in molecular developmental biology and/or neurobiology in addition to teratology provides trainees with flexibility to enter scientifi careers in teratology, developmental toxicology, neurobehavioral teratology, developmental biology, or developmental neuroscience with equal facility. This renewal continues the strengths of the program from the past and adds new faculty and resources to move teratology training to the next level of understanding the prenatal origins of disorders and diseases."
"9220661","Center PI: Malenka, Robert C. Principal Investigator (Project 2): Südhof, Thomas/Malenka, Robert  Summary  Although long-term synaptic plasticity has been studied for half a century, the fundamental mechanisms that  mediate process such as NMDA-receptor-dependent LTP remain largely unknown, and the biological  significance of LTP is incompletely understood. Here, we propose a novel avenue to understanding LTP by  focusing on our recent unexpected observation that two different postsynaptic cell-adhesion molecules,  LRRTMs and neuroligins which both bind to presynaptic neurexins, are essential for normal LTP. The present  project is guided by the hypothesis that understanding trans-synaptic signaling mediated by neurexin-based  cell adhesion may provide insight into the coordinated structural changes and vesicular trafficking events that  occur postsynaptically during LTP. Four specific aims utilizing conditional knockout mice of LRRTMs and  neuroligins are proposed to test this overall hypothesis. Specific Aim 1 will examine how LRRTMs and  neuroligins contribute to LTP, Specific Aim 2 will map candidate molecular interactions of LRRTMs and  neuroligins that underlie their function in LTP, Specific Aim 3 will test the role of these interactions in LTP using  replacement of endogenous with mutant proteins in conditional knockout mice, and Specific Aim 4 will test the  behavioral significance of the function of LRRTMs and neuroligins especially in learning and memory, with the  aim to develop tests of the role of LTP in memory that involve highly selective changes in only LTP. Together,  these experiments will advance our understanding of the relation between trans-synaptic cell adhesion  mediated by neurexins and their ligands and long-term plasticity, thus contributing not only insight into how  synapses are formed and function, but also into how LTP is induced and expressed.  Relevance  In studying LRRTMs and neuroligins, the present project will not only shed light on how these central  organizers of synapses contribute to long-term plasticity and on the mechanisms of such plasticity, but will also  provide a basic understanding of the potential role of these proteins in neuropsychiatric disorders such as  autism and schizophrenia to which these proteins have been linked genetically.

"9213375","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gap junctions are integral membrane proteins that enable the direct cytoplasmic exchange of ions and low-molecular-mass metabolites between adjacent cells. They provide a pathway for propagating and/or amplifying the signal transduction cascades triggered by cytokines, growth factors, and other cell signaling molecules involved in growth regulation and development. Dysfunctional intercellular communication via gap junctions has been implicated in causing many human diseases. The objective of this project is to use a multi-disciplinary approach to identify the key intrinsic regulatory mechanisms that are responsible for Cx43 and Cx45 function. The central hypothesis is that unique intermolecular interactions within the divergent CT domain of Cxs affect gap junction regulation. More specifically, we hypothesize that in the failing heart, Cx43CT phosphorylation alters protein partner interactions leading to remodeling of Cx43 from the intercalated disc, and that dimerization of Cx45 CTs is, in part, responsible for the channel properties of Cx45 that distinguish it from Cx43 and for the dominant-negative effect of Cx45 in heteromeric channels with Cx43. It is well-known that the CT domains of Cxs are key regulators of channel properties, and that dimerization of cytosolic domains are key regulators of ion channels. This proposal is significant because discovery of how interactions mediated by the CT domain can be modulated would open the door to strategies to ameliorate the pathological effects of altered Cx regulation in the failing heart. The following Specific Aims are proposed to investigate this concept: 1) Define how tyrosine kinases down regulate Cx43 gap junction intercellular communication, 2) Determine how Cx43 phosphorylation alters protein partner interactions, and 3) Identify the importance and mechanism of Cx45CT dimerization."
"9229067","ABSTRACT: Neuroelectric oscillations reflect synchronous excitability fluctuations in ensembles of neurons, ubiquitous in the waking (and sleeping) brain, and are believed to be fundamental instruments in adaptive brain function. Through oscillatory phase reset and entrainment, the large delta (1-3 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) oscillations that dominate the spontaneous activity spectrum in auditory cortex can be harnessed as tools that allow the brain to parse, select and represent rhythmic event streams ranging from simple pure tones to multiscale patterns like speech. Despite the demonstrable importance of oscillatory entrainment in selective attention and other cognitive brain operations, physiological mechanisms underlying these dynamical processes remain poorly understood. Of fundamental importance, a wide range of findings converge on the idea that established neuronal ensembles operate according to transient activation cycles. While flexible, activation cycles are physiologically constrained to operate within certain dynamic resonance ranges. These cycles both frame transient sensory evoked responses and form the building blocks of brain rhythms.  We propose to develop a combination of computational and physiological methods. Our long-term goal is a mechanistic, physiological understanding of the ways that neuronal dynamics generate cognitive abilities. As an initial exploratory step, we will develop an iterative exchange between computational and physiological investigations focusing on primary auditory cortex (A1). We will address the dynamic cellular mechanisms underlying the tendency of A1 ensembles to oscillate near preferred resonance frequencies, and those causing ensembles? entrainment to behaviorally relevant event streams. The more specific goals are: 1) Devise a mechanistic computational model of A1 incorporating key dynamics, 2) Test the model?s starting specifications and iteratively refine them by recordings in primary auditory cortex of monkeys during performance of auditory discriminations, and 3) Evaluate the model?s predictions by manipulation of A1 physiology using nerve stimulation methods that can impact both A1 dynamics and behavior.  The proposed merger of computational and ensemble physiology methods is a novel venture, with admittedly high-risk components. However, success in any of our aims will improve the mechanistic understanding of disorders such as schizophrenia, in which sensory entrainment at both low and high frequencies is demonstrably impaired. Findings in these exploratory studies will support and inform a broader effort to develop a more detailed concrete picture of the properties of neuronal ensembles that create brain rhythms and organize them to perform fundamental cognitive operations."

"9204039","ABSTRACT Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections are highly prevalent in men and women. High-risk (HR) HPV types 16 & 18 (HPV16/18) are responsible for ~90% of all anal cancers, whose incidence has risen by 96% in the last 2- 3 decades primarily because of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Indeed, HIV-infected men who have sex with men (HIV+MSM) are the population at highest risk of anal cancer with an incidence rate of 137 per 100,000 compared with 2 per 100,000 among HIV-uninfected men. Current anal cancer screening begins with an anal Papanicolaou (Pap) test to look for abnormal cytology, and in some clinics include HR-HPV DNA testing, which detects infection. If cytologic abnormalities of atypical squamous cells of unknown significance or higher are found on the anal Pap, patients are referred for high-resolution anoscopy (HRA), an invasive procedure to visualize and remove abnormal tissue for histology. Unfortunately, anal Pap screening under-estimates the grade of dysplasia compared to histology. Furthermore, HR-HPV DNA screening has limited utility among the HIV+MSM population because prevalence of anal HPV infection is so high (~80%). Screening individuals for HR-HPV DNA, although sensitive for detecting infection, is not specific for predicting risk of anal dysplasia. A more specific companion diagnostic is urgently needed to help determine when someone should be referred for HRA or not. To that end, we will be the first to assess the following combined measures of HPV gene expression from anal specimens: a) methylation status of all 15 CpG sites within the long control region (LCR) upstream of E6/E7 oncogenes, b) intra-epithelial levels of HR-HPV E6/E7 mRNA, and c) HPV 16/18 E6 protein expression. We hypothesize that combining 1 or more of these biomarkers with the anal Pap test, rather than the HR-HPV DNA test, would improve specificity for predicting AIN2+. To evaluate this, we will conduct a cross-sectional study of a diverse population of HIV+MSM with abnormal anal Pap results, who are undergoing HRA at clinics here in the District of Columbia, the city with the highest HIV prevalence rate in the U.S. Prior to the HRA procedure, 3 anal swabs will be collected: DNA will be extracted from one and used to assess CpG methylation patterns, an epigenetic biomarker, in HPV16/18 LCR, while the 2nd will be placed into liquid-based cytology media for HPV DNA genotyping, HR-HPV E6/E7 mRNA expression, and HPV16/18 E6 oncoprotein detection, and the 3rd will be analyzed directly for HPV16/18 E6 oncoproteins. Results of these tests will be compared independently for their ability to predict AIN2+ from HRA guided biopsies. HPV DNA genotyping data will permit us to characterize distribution of anogenital HPV types found in HIV+MSM here in DC. Identifying a more specific biomarker will improve the accuracy of predicting anal dysplasia in this high-risk group by providing stronger evidence to justify HRA if positive, or reduce the rate of unnecessary HRA if negative. Discovering a better companion diagnostics remains important in the HPV vaccine era because many HIV+MSM were never vaccinated and vaccine uptake continues to be lower than the target goals."
"9392818","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The slow translation of health-related research findings into practice is well documented and this extends to health literacy interventions. Our R21 application is driven by the desire to reduce the excessive lag times along the research pipeline by speeding the translation of emergent findings from SIPsmartER, a health literacy intervention to reduce sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption. SSB consumption is a high priority public health behavior and contributes ~7% of total energy intake for US adults. Unfortunately, the targeted Appalachian region of Southwest Virginia for this application exceeds the national average consumption of SSB by more than three times. SIPsmartER is a theory-based, 6-month, multi- component health literacy intervention designed to reduce SSB intake and is currently being tested in a type 1 effectiveness-implementation hybrid RCT. Emerging findings from this rigorously designed trial illustrate that SIPsmartER is an efficacious intervention to decrease SSB intake: intervention participants have significantly decreased SSB intake by 236 SSB kcals/day (SD=46) from 0 to 6 months compared to a decrease of 54 SSB kcals/day (SD=19) in the control group (p<0.001). Furthermore, SSB outcomes and SIPsmartER completion rates do not vary by health literacy status and preliminary data indicate that SSB reductions are being sustained one year post intervention. To translate these promising effects into population-level SSB  reductions, a concerted effort is needed to understand the feasibility of organizational-level adoption and implementation of SIPsmartER within existing systems and to develop an implementation support system to aid in delivery. Additionally, since a system-delivered SIPsmartER intervention would be conducted under less-controlled conditions, ascertaining individual-level effects on SSB consumption is necessary. Thus, our approach is guided by the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) Framework and integrates the Interactive Systems Framework and cutting-edge strategies for advancing organizational-level health literacy. We target four medically-underserved Southwest Virginia Department of Health districts and their client population, and propose a mixed-methods design that includes formative, process, and outcome evaluations. Our primary aim is to develop, establish feasibility, and determine the potential utility of an implementation strategy for SIPsmartER, which will reflect system-level needs, barriers, and resources specific to SIPsmartER, as well as build general capacity related to organizational health literacy. Secondary aims are to determine the adoption and implementation process at the organization-level and determine individual-level reach and effectiveness of SIPsmartER within an existing system. The goal is to have an implementation support system for SIPsmartER that can be tested in a subsequent full-scale R01 type 3 effectiveness-implementation hybrid randomized-controlled trial, with a long-term goal of broad scale dissemination of SIPsmartER within public health care systems to achieve population-level reductions in SSB."
"9388587","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a result of medical advances that prolong the lives of many patients with life- threatening conditions (cancer, AIDS, and transplants), which often compromise host defenses and immunity, the incidence of opportunistic fungal infections continues to increase. The development of new antifungal drugs has improved the prognosis for many patients, but they have also led to the emergence of new and more resistant pathogenic fungi. Thus, it is essential to recruit and train young scientists to develop rigorous independent careers focused on mycological research. The same mandate applies to research on fungal plant pathogens, which continue to reduce the global food supply. In contrast, several innocuous fungal species have become powerful surrogates for studies of eukaryotic biology and genetics. These model fungi species have proved indispensable in driving progress in biomedical sciences and biotechnology. Thus, investigators and institutes in multiple areas of research continue to seek scientists who are capable of utilizing model fungi as experimental tools.             This application proposes a continuation of the multidisciplinary, tri-institutional Molecular Mycology and Pathogenesis Training Program (MMPTP), which was awarded 10 years ago. The MMPTP involves three neighboring institutions, Duke University, North Carolina State University and North Carolina University at Chapel Hill. The 26 faculty members constitute perhaps the largest concentration of researchers who study fungi. They share resources, interact regularly, and collaborate frequently. The MMPTP recruits, supports, and trains promising postdoctoral scientists and physicians to develop productive research careers in molecular mycology and pathogenesis. Candidates for training include recent doctoral graduates in biomedical sciences, physicians who have completed residency training, and experienced postdoctoral fungal researchers with outstanding potential who are supported for shorter tenures to enhance their expertise. These trainees will become the future experts and leaders in diverse areas of fungal research in academia, industry, and government. The MMPTP has been highly successful. All 24 trainees who completed the program have productive careers in science. One is a governmental scientist, seven are in industry, and 16 are in academia including multiple alumni who are assistant and associate professors with tenure excelling in mycology."
"9361342","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): New Methods to Access GPI-Anchored Proteins and Study GPI-Anchored Proteomics Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) attachment to the protein and glycoprotein C-terminus is an important and ubiquitous posttranslational modification in eukaryotic species, which helps anchor proteins and glycoproteins to the extracellular membrane. GPI-anchored proteins and glycoproteins play a pivotal role in various biological and pathological processes. However, currently, detailed studies on these molecules and their functions are limited, mainly because of the difficulty to access them in pure form and sufficient quantity and the lack of proper tools to analyze these diverse, complex, and amphipathic molecules. Therefore, it is highly desirable to have strategies that can facilitate access to and investigation of GPI-anchored proteins and glycoproteins.  The ultimate goals of this research project are to develop strategies that enable access to homogeneous and structurally defined natural GPI-anchored proteins and glycoproteins and strategies that enable rapid, effective isolation and analysis of GPI-anchored proteins and glycoproteins. Accordingly, this proposal has three specific aims. Aim 1 is to prepare both the recombinant catalytic subunit GPI8 of GPI transamidase (GPI-T), the natural enzyme used by eukaryotic cells to attach GPIs to proteins, and membrane-associated intact GPI-T derived from the cell endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and uses them to create a potentially general method for enzymatic synthesis of natural GPI-anchored proteins and glycoproteins. Aim 2 is to develop a practical strategy for the study of GPI- anchored proteins expressed by cells via metabolic engineering of GPI-anchored protein biosynthetic pathways, namely, to give cells or isolated ERs a tagged synthetic GPI analog that can be used by GPI-T to add to proteins bound for GPI attachment. This will result in the specific labeling of GPI-anchored proteins to enable their rapid isolation and then MS-based proteomics analysis. Aim 3 is to develop a practical strategy for the study of cell surface GPI-anchored proteomics by using CAPM factor, a bacterial toxin that has a high-affinity binding to GPI anchors, to facilitate the isolation of GPI-linked proteins and glycoproteins released from cells upon treatment with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C enzyme and subsequent GPI-anchored proteomics analysis.  Both the strategy for natural GPI-anchored protein and glycoprotein synthesis and the two strategies for GPI- anchored proteomics study are original and innovative, because currently there is no method for the synthesis of truly natural GPI-anchored proteins/glycoproteins and no proper method for systematic study of GPI-anchored proteomics. The proposed research will have a broad and significant impact. A practical synthetic method for GPI-anchored proteins and glycoproteins will allow access to these important molecules and their functionalized analogs in pure and defined forms for various biological and biophysical studies. Strategies allowing systematic study of GPI-anchored proteomics will help reveal the relationships between GPI-anchored proteins and diseases, as well as other important information, and help identify new protein markers. The results will be widely useful for the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies with modulated activity, targeting ability, etc."
"9316043","C57BL/6 mice infected with the neurotropic rJ2.2 variant of the JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (rJ2.2) develop acute and chronic demyelinating encephalomyelitis and thereby serve as a useful model for the human disease multiple sclerosis. The overall objective of this project has been to understand virus-host interactions, to enhance virus clearance and minimize tissue damage. In the past funding period, we concentrated on aspects of the T cell response that were pathogenic but protective and others that were regulatory, dampening CD4 T cell-mediated immunopathological changes. However, before a T cell response can clear virus, the host must mount a well-orchestrated and robust innate immune response. Our recent work has focused on two aspects of this early innate response, both involving microglia, which are the resident myeloid cells in the CNS. First, we showed that microglia are critical for protection. Although microglia have important roles in immune surveillance and maintenance of homeostasis in the CNS, their role in the context of infection remains ill-defined. Our results show that they are key for protection from rJ2.2 infection. Second, we found that signaling of a single eicosanoid, prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), through its DP1 receptor, found on myeloid cells including microglia, was required for optimal survival in rJ2.2-infected mice. In the absence of DP1 signaling, type 1 IFN (IFN-I) expression was delayed and IL-1? expression was increased, suggesting that PGD2/DP1 signaling was critical for a balanced immune response. The absence of PGD2/DP1 signaling resulting in dysregulated microglia function. Therefore, the central objective of this project is to better understand the many roles that microglia have in enhancing the host response to viral infections in the brain and thereby improving outcomes in the context of viral encephalitis (and ultimately, demyelinating disease). This objection will be addressed in the following specific aims. Specific Aim 1: To determine the basis for lethal outcomes in microglia-depleted rJ2.2-infected mice. In this aim, mice will be treated with PLX6522, which depletes microglia. We will monitor virus clearance and immune function after treatment. We will assess whether macrophage numbers, function or gene expression is changed in the absence of microglia. Specific Aim 2: To determine the role of PGD2/DP1 signaling in microglia in rJ2.2-infected mice. In this aim, we will assess effects of PGD2/DP1 on viral control and the host immune response. We found that a PYRIN domain only protein, PYDC3, was downregulated in microglia of mice lacking DP1 signaling. PYDC3 has similarities to IFN-I-inducible human proteins that regulate inflammasome formation and activation but homologous proteins have not been identified in mice.

This proposed 5-year NIAID K01 grant will support the research and career development of Dr. Steven Bellan, a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (CCBB) at The University of Texas at Austin (UT). Dr. Bellan's long-term career goal is to become a leader in the use of high performance computing to identify and solve infectious disease problems. Dr. Bellan's research helps plan and interpret epidemiological studies by accounting for study design-driven biases with innovative simulation methods that explicitly model empirical studies as observation processes superimposed over transmission processes. His background in epidemiology, statistics, mathematics, and disease ecology make Dr. Bellan uniquely qualified to contribute significantly to infectious disease epidemiology at the nexus between transmission modeling and epidemiological study design. His research has already led to key insights into HIV epidemiology and helped the CDC plan their recent Ebola vaccine trial. Dr. Bellan's short-term goals during the award are to build relationships with new mentors and collaborators, to publish scientific manuscripts to boost his already strong publication record, and to develop training in four new areas: (1) cutting-edge methods in computational statistics; (2) clinical trial ethics; (3) decision-support tool development; and (4) HIV policy. He will gain this training through guided self-study, courses at UT, online courses from Harvard and Georgetown, and a summer workshop at the University of Washington. Dr. Bellan's development into a successful independent investigator will be guided by a diverse mentorship committee with expertise in transmission modeling, study design, computational statistics, HIV epidemiology and policy, decision-support tool development, and bioethics: Drs. Lauren Meyers (UT), Mike Daniels (UT), Brian Williams (Stellenbosch), and Rieke van der Graaf (Utrecht Medical Center). With this training, Dr. Bellan will also advance his ability to train others, in particular, through his role teaching workshops on quantitative methods in infectious disease epidemiology to students, researchers, and public health professionals in Africa and the US since 2009.  ENVIRONMENT. UT is an excellent setting for a mentored career award to Dr. Bellan because of its emphasis on integrating biological, epidemiological, and statistical research to understand infectious diseases, as evidenced by its CCBB and Center for Infectious Diseases, which foster collaboration between researchers from diverse departments. The Dept. of Population Health at UT's incipient Dell Medical School provides a unique opportunity for Dr. Bellan to forge collaborations with clinical researchers during the nascent stage of a biomedical research hub. Finally, UT's computational resources are world class; Dr. Bellan will leverage UT's Texas Advanced Computing Center, one of the most powerful computing resources in the world, to bring the computational advances of the last decade to key questions in infectious disease epidemiology. This unique environment will help ensure that Dr. Bellan develops into a successful independent investigator.  RESEARCH. The goals of the proposed research are to illuminate the drivers of HIV epidemic variation across sub-Saharan Africa and to build a decision-support tool for evaluating the statistical and ethical merits of vaccine efficacy trial designs during emerging epidemics. This work will inform HIV control policies and prepare for vaccine research during future outbreaks of emerging pathogens like the West African Ebola epidemic. While spanning diverse questions, these goals are united by their innovative integration of classically distinct fields: mathematical modeling and epidemiological study design. Aim 1: The HIV transmission rate has been measured almost exclusively in cohorts that follow stable partnerships between infected and uninfected partners (serodiscordant couples). Yet, couples with a high propensity to transmit exhibit serodiscordance fleetingly, reducing their representation in such studies and downwards-biasing estimates of the HIV transmission rate. To characterize heterogeneity in HIV transmission, adjust for its role in biasing transmission rate estimates, and assess its impact on HIV control strategies, this research will fit a couples transmission model to a 20-year long population cohort data set from Rakai, Uganda that superimposes a model of the cohort's study design over transmission, couple formation and dissolution, loss-to-follow up, and mortality processes. Aim 2: HIV epidemic severity varies widely at both national and subnational levels in sub-Saharan Africa. Limited understanding of the relative role of biological and behavioral drivers underlying this variation hampers the development of successful and locally tailored control strategies. This work will use observed couple serostatus distributions from Demographic and Health Surveys in 25 African countries and counterfactual simulations to systematically partition out the extent to which elevated transmission rates vs. riskier sexual mixing behaviors drive the most severe epidemics and to inform locally-tailored control strategies. Aim 3: Debates on the ethical and statistical merits of diverse trial designs contributed to the delayed initiation of Ebola vaccine trials until after the epidemic had substantially declined. To prepare more rapid decision-making capabilities for future epidemics of acute emerging pathogens, this work will develop a simulation-based decision-support tool that crystallizes ethical and statistical tradeoffs between diverse trial designs and facilitates interdisciplinary dialogue between clinicians, epidemiologists, modelers and bioethicists."
"9261052","PROJECT SUMMARY Asthma and obesity are two of the most common chronic illnesses worldwide. Epidemiologic studies have consistently demonstrated the comorbidity of these conditions, with longitudinal reports suggesting that obesity is a risk factor for the development of asthma and vice versa. Asthma and obesity have strong genetic components, and twin studies suggest that a potential mechanism explaining the asthma-obesity association is shared genetic predisposition or genetic pleiotropy. However, to date, only a few studies have empirically sought to identify the posited pleiotropic variants. Those studies had limited success in identifying pleiotropic loci and had important methodological constraints, including the use of a candidate-gene approach. Specifically, the candidate-gene approach is limited by our current understanding of the genetic architectures of obesity and asthma and of the mechanistic overlaps between the two diseases. Therefore, our study will search for genetic variants that display pleiotropy for asthma and obesity using a hypothesis-free genome-wide association study approach. Two analytic methods will be employed: (1) a univariate pleiotropy-informed false discovery rate-based framework and (2) a multivariate approach called MultiPhen. Our discovery-phase analyses will utilize existing genotype and phenotype data from the third wave of the Nord-TrØndelag Health study (HUNT3). The HUNT3 analytic sample will consist of n=27,712 adults aged 20 years or older [11,285 obese and 1,119 asthmatic cases (of which 639 are both obese and asthmatic), and 15,947 non-asthmatic, normal weight controls]. Genome-wide significant pleiotropic loci identified in HUNT3 will be candidates for replication. Our replication-phase analyses will utilize existing phenotype and whole-exome sequencing data from Dr. Andrew DeWan's FAstGen Study. The FAstGen analytic sample will consist of n=384 adults aged 18 years or older [182 obese and 154 asthmatic cases (of which 81 are both obese and asthmatic) and 129 non- asthmatic, normal weight controls]. In secondary analyses, we will characterize the effects of the candidate pleiotropic loci via mediation analyses. We will also investigate whether the candidate pleiotropic loci are associated with asthma and obesity in children, using data from a subset of HUNT3 subjects who were originally recruited into the first wave of the adolescent component of HUNT (Young-HUNT1) and thus also have phenotype data from adolescence [n=1,202; ages 13-19 years]. Lastly, we will evaluate the performance of our two analytic methods, using replication of pleiotropic signals as a metric of the relative performance of the methods. This will be the first study to investigate pleiotropy for asthma and obesity on a genome-wide scale, using pleiotropy-informed methods and incorporating mediation analyses to characterize pleiotropic effects. Findings from this work will advance our understanding of the mechanistic links between asthma and obesity; provide the first comparison of the performance of our two pleiotropy detection methods using real- world data; and promote specific prevention and treatment efforts for obese asthmatics."

"9403036","Project Summary/Abstract Natural selection drives adaptive evolution by spreading beneficial mutations through populations. However, the ability of selection to act on epistatic interactions between mutations at different loci depends on recombination. With high levels of recombination, such as those observed in sexual eukaryotes, genes associate with one another randomly, such that natural selection cannot effectively act on particular interacting combinations but instead acts on the average effect of each gene across all genetic backgrounds. Bacteria do not sexually reproduce but still recombine through a process called homologous recombination that occurs less frequently and involves shorter segments of DNA than recombination in eukaryotes. Within these highly linked bacterial genomes, selection may compete favorably with recombination to promote the spread of beneficially interacting mutations. The goal of this project is to advance our understanding of bacterial evolution by quantifying the ability of selection to act on epistatic fitness effects in bacterial genomes and how this selective process leaves observable signatures in genomic data. Additionally, this project will involve the development of novel genomic analyses to study the evolution of gene networks that likely harbor epistatically interacting mutations. The first aim of this proposal uses novel population genetic computer simulations to study how epistasis drives bacterial evolution. Since the relative importance epistasis depends on the fitness effects of epistatic interactions compared to individual additive gene effects and recombination, these quantities will be varied across simulations. The sensitivity of bacterial genomes to epistasis will be measured by their tendency to form beneficial combinations of alleles that expand in the population. Once these clones consisting of beneficial combinations of alleles increase in frequency and the population reaches a local fitness optimum, recombination dynamics may change owing to recombinants having lower fitness unless a sufficiently large change enables colonization of another local fitness optimum. A similar simulation framework will be employed to study these recombination dynamics between populations at different fitness optima and quantify how the interplay between selection and recombination may create heterogeneity in observed patterns of homologous recombination, in terms of both the observed rate and tract length distributions. These simulations will test the hypothesis that heterogeneity increases with the relative strength of epistatic to additive fitness effects, and thus selection for particular allelic combinations. The second aim explores the evolution of highly interacting genes that potentially harbor epistatically interacting mutations. Using known interaction networks from well- characterized metabolic genes, novel genomic analyses will be created to study how the structure and connectivity of network interactions explains patterns of genomic variation in the bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. Preliminary analyses indicate that selection may be maintaining certain allele combinations of metabolic genes, as expected under a model of fitness epistasis."
"9213331","Project Summary Abstract This pilot application responds to NIMH Pilot Research on Services for Transition-Age Youth? (R34) by developing and testing an integrated intervention to increase neurocognitive and social cognitive skills to improve functioning and postsecondary outcomes for transition-age students with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Our innovative community-based High School SUCCESS (Supported, Comprehensive Cognitive Enhancement and Social Skills) intervention will be delivered within educational settings: high schools and transition programs, to develop the executive functioning and social cognition skills referred to as ?soft skills? that are instrumental in life success. This study has the potential to make a significant public health impact by developing an evidence-based intervention for transition-age youth (TAY) with ASD delivered in real-world services to promote a successful adult life. It also has the potential of advancing the field in neurobehavioral science by measuring cognitive skills as initial behavioral change targets, exploring the relationship and impact cognitions have on functional behaviors that contribute to educational and vocational attainment and overall well-being. With over 50,000 students with ASD exiting the educational system each year and up to 50% without employment and 70% without postsecondary education in adulthood there is a strong need for evidence-based interventions for the transition period. The passage of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA, 2014), has increased the priority of services to transition-age youth with disabilities and now many states have established interagency collaboratives to enhance transition supports and linkages to postsecondary services leading to a more seamless move from the youth entitlement system to the adult qualification system. By utilizing research-community partnership methods, we have worked in collaboration with the community through our partnership of researchers, providers, educators and consumers, Active Collaborative Hub for Individuals with ASD to Enhance Vocation and Education (ACHIEVE) group, to develop a cognitive training intervention for adults with ASD that adapted evidenced -based interventions for schizophrenia and traumatic brain injury. We propose to adapt this adult program for TAY through 3 specific aims: (1) Conduct a Context Assessment to characterize the High School and Transition Programs across districts to understand the variability in program level (services/curriculums, staffing, training, setting) and student level (demographics, functioning) and identify facilitators and barriers to intervention implementation to inform the intervention development and research plan; (2) With our ACHIEVE partners, develop the High School SUCCESS program to fit the needs of transition-age youth with ASD within the community educational system; (3) Conduct a pilot study (n=12 school sites & n=60 students) to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and implementation procedures (recruitment, randomization, retention & training strategies) of High School SUCCESS and to obtain estimates of effects to support a future large-scale effectiveness trial."

"9210035","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While older adults typically show a variety of memory impairments, goals and motivation can influence what people remember, and can help older adults remember important information. The proposed research examines how goals can motivate and improve memory in older adults, through the strategic focus on selectively remembering both objectively and subjectively important information. This is examined by having younger and older adults remember information based on the value or importance of the information, and value or level of importance can differ based on one's goals. We test this by having younger and older adults rate how important certain to-be-remembered units of information are to remember for a task (e.g., when packing for a trip) or how interested they are in the information (e.g., when learning answers to novel trivia questions), to determine if later memory is related to ratings of importance and interest, and if age-differences in memory performance are reduced for important information. We also examine how older adults' memory and selective processing is enhanced when they are asked to communicate interesting or important information to another individual, suggesting that social communication can facilitate and enhance memory for important information. We then test how older adults use financial and social information to guide, and sometimes selectively bias, memory for faces associated with monetary rewards/losses, and social status. We extend this work to a practical and theoretically-guided translational situation, such as remembering critical side effects of medications, and using strategies to remember the positive and negative effects of taking the medication. The findings have implications for financial decision-making, planning for retirement as well as monitoring and maintaining good health when taking medications. Taken together, the proposed research has the potential to enhance the quality of life and independence of older adults by providing an efficient goal-based strategy to remember important information."

"9271655","Project Summary/Abstract HIV incidence among people who inject drugs (PWID) in New York City (NYC) has reached its lowest rate in the past two decades. This achievement is linked to increased access to sterile syringes, drug treatment, and HIV antiretroviral therapy. Despite significant reductions in HIV prevalence among NYC PWID (from 50% in the 1980s to 12% today), injection-related transmission persists. Migrant PWID in NYC who began injecting in Puerto Rico (P.R.) are a key component of the PWID population that contributes to ongoing HIV incidence in the U.S. Migrant Puerto Rican PWID in NYC have pronounced language barriers, very high HCV prevalence, and significantly higher injection risk behaviors when compared to U.S.-born PWID (including U.S.-born Puerto Ricans). As a result, HIV and HCV prevalence is high in this population. In NYC in 2012, Hispanics were 45% of new HIV cases among PWID, and 39% of these new HIV cases among Hispanics occurred among migrant Puerto Ricans. Studies also suggest HIV infection in NYC is a likely outcome for many migrants. Currently, P.R.'s economic crisis is fueling the migration of thousands of Puerto Ricans to the U.S. mainland. Many of these are PWID searching for access to services that are scarce in P.R.: Drug and HIV/HCV treatment. Still, too many continue to engage in injection risks regardless of access to these services. While the presence of ?native? norms influencing their injection risks are documented (e.g., a ?Puerto Rican-way? to inject drugs endorsing syringe sharing among ?brothers?), the extent of these risk norms, and their persistence over time, remain elusive. Because we do not understand these phenomena, we remain unprepared to help this population avoid acquiring and/or transmitting HIV/HCV after migration. We hypothesize there are two norm- related mechanisms influencing injection risks: (1) risk-acculturation ? a process where through migrants' engagement in prevention programs they adopt NYC-specific [less risky] injection norms while replacing native [riskier] ones; and (2) risk-enculturation ? whereby migrants may retain elements of their native injection norms despite access to services. Our goal is to help reduce health disparities by developing a risk-acculturation intervention to curb HIV/HCV infections in this population. To do this, we will conduct an exploratory study with 65 migrant Puerto Rican PWID, and 6 of their service providers, that will: 1) identify the native risk norms -and other influences- that require risk-acculturation, 2) explore existing risk reduction programs and services to identify limitations, and 3) develop and pilot test components of a risk-acculturation intervention for migrants. We will use a multilayered qualitative approach: 1) in-depth longitudinal interviews with 40 migrants, 2) two institutional ethnographies (one-time in-depth interviews with 10 migrants, and 6 service providers; coupled with structured observations), and 3) three focus groups (N=15 migrants). Intervention Mapping protocols will guide the intervention development process. Results will serve as a blueprint in the development of a comprehensive risk-acculturation intervention for migrant Puerto Rican PWID in a subsequent R34 proposal."
"9225193","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is reaching epidemic proportions in Western societies. T2D occurs when the ß-cells of the pancreas do not secrete enough insulin to properly regulate peripheral blood glucose levels, usually in the face of obesity and associated peripheral insulin resistance. The mechanisms underlying insulin secretion are not properly understood. Using a forward genetics approach, we have discovered that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the protein-coding region of the gene for tomosyn-2 is directly correlated with the hypoinsulinemic/hyperglycemic phenotype. Tomosyn-2 is a relatively uncharacterized protein and the mechanism by which it regulates insulin secretion is not known. The work proposed here in this Pathways to Independence Award application has two primary goals: 1) to elucidate the mechanism by which tomosyn-2 regulates insulin secretion in pancreatic ß-cells, and 2) to use my development of this novel area of T2D research to facilitate the development of my career from the mentored phase to an independent phase. During the mentored phase of the grant, I will receive training in mass spectrometry, in vitro liposome fusion assays, membrane biochemistry, and the generation of the tomosyn-2 knockout mouse. The research conducted in the mentored phase will examine the effect of identified phosphorylation sites on the ability of tomosyn-2 to regulate insulin secretion and to understand the mechanism by which tomosyn-2 is targeted for proteosomal degradation. During the independent phase of the grant, my research will examine the mechanism by which tomosyn-2 inhibits insulin secretion by regulating the activity of soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins and characterize the role of novel tomosyn-2 binding proteins. These studies will provide novel clues to the mechanism by which tomosyn-2 inhibits insulin secretion and will further our understanding of the regulation of insulin secretio in T2D."
"9205515","Project Summary/Abstract: Mimicry of Amyloid Oligomers  Amyloid oligomers now thought to be the damaging molecular species in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and many other amyloid diseases. Understanding the structures of these oligomers is essential to understanding their mechanism of action, and quite possibly to developing drugs to prevent or treat these diseases. Studying the structures of the oligomers at high resolution is challenging, because the oligomers are heterogeneous and dynamic, forming a variety of sizes and structures that can interconvert. The oligomers are metastable, with fibrils being the more thermodynamically stable species. Only a few studies have provided glimpses of amyloid oligomers at atomic resolution. Thus far, the there are no atomic-resolution structures of oligomers of the beta-amyloid peptide, Abeta, the 40 or 42 amino acid polypeptide closely associated with Alzheimer's disease.  This proposal aims to determine the structures of oligomers formed by Abeta by incorporating key fragments of Abeta into macrocyclic beta-sheet peptides designed to mimic the key beta-hairpin building blocks that are thought to make up Abeta oligomers. The PI has determined X-ray crystallographic structures at atomic resolution of trimers formed macrocyclic beta-sheet peptides containing fragments from the central and the C-terminal regions of Abeta. The trimers have a hitherto unprecedented structure consisting of a triangular arrangement of beta-hairpins that pack together at the three vertices. The trimers further assemble to form hexamers and dodecamers.  This proposal aims to build on the discovery of these trimers and higher-order oligomeric assemblies. The broad overarching goal is to understand the relationship between the atomic-resolution structures of the oligomers and their biological and biophysical properties. To achieve these goals, the PI will synthesize macrocyclic beta-sheet peptides that incorporate different aspects of Abeta structure, determine the X-ray crystallographic structures of the oligomers that these peptides form, measure their cytotoxicity, elucidate their mechanisms of cytotoxcity, and correlate their cytotoxicity and their crystallographic structure by means of biophysical studies of their solution-phase properties."
"9397803","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Good nutrition is important for health and longevity, yet many Americans do not consume nutritionally sound diets. Evidence suggests that infants' and children's earliest patterns of eating have lasting consequences for health across the lifespan. Despite the complexity and significance of food selection, developmental psychologists have devoted surprisingly little attention to studying how infants and children perceive, learn, and reason about foods. The current proposal employs methods from cognitive development to test social influences on infants' and children's food choices and consumption. The current studies test two age groups: (1) infants, who have limited knowledge in the food domain, but are typically open to a variety of foods and flavors; and (2) young children (3-6 years), who are more knowledgeable than infants and toddlers about foods, yet are notoriously picky eaters who are intolerant of new foods and flavors. Five studies with 12-month-old infants investigate and compare infants' social learning and reasoning about foods vs. (non-food) objects. These studies test how infants' earliest food and object choices are influenced by an informant's social group membership (Study 1), an informant's emotional display (Studies 2- 3), and an informant's method of teaching (Study 4). A final study with infants tests whether infants see an endorser's food and object preferences as unique to that individual, or as common to many individuals (Study 5). This research aims to contribute both to our understanding of the factors that guide early eating, and also to theoretical knowledge concerning whether infants' early social learning is domain-general, or varies by domain (i.e., foods vs. objects). Four studies with 3-6-year-old children systematically test the conditions under which children's food selection may be susceptible to social messages and contexts. This research will investigate how the social group identities of informants (i.e., their accent, gender, and race) influence children's selection of foods (Studies 6-7), and also how the how the type of message provided by an informant (i.e., positive vs. negative; social vs. biological) influences children's food selection (Studies 8-9). This research aims to explore the mechanisms underlying children's food selection, with the eventual goal of effecting positive change in children's willingness to select healthy foods that are familiar and disliked, and limiting their selection of unhealthy foods that are familiar and liked.)"

Over the past 10 years, we successfully graduated 31 out of 33 (94%) trainees, and 18 have received substantial independent funding including 6 career development awards (K08, K12, and K23), 1 R01, 2 R21s, 1 grant from the NIEHS, 5 NARSAD awards, 16 foundation grants, 4 pilot awards from the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), 3 awards from the Sackler Institute of Developmental Psychobiology, 4 NIH loan repayment awards, 4 awards from the New York State Office of Mental Health, and 1 Paul Janssen Fellowship. We currently have 6 fellows, 2 of whom are under-represented minorities. Two fellows are graduating this month and 2 female MD fellows have accepted to begin in July.  In the last submission of this T32, the committee concluded that the preceptors and training environment were deemed outstanding by the review committee. The reviewers also commented that the program has a strong record of producing exceptional independently funded trainees. That submission described a training plan that strengthened the opportunities in translational research by enhancement of the didactic teaching program and strategic addition of mentors. To further improve the training program and recruitment of a diverse applicant pool we have taken substantive steps by restructuring the program leadership, involving a wider range of accomplished faculty, and revising the didactics."
"9222693","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) starts >2-4 decades prior to onset of clinical dementia. Therefore it is critical to identify persons with preclinical AD, who may be most responsive to preventive interventions, and also risk factors and biomarkers for preclinical AD which may lead to new, effective AD prevention strategies. We propose to study, in a community-based cohort, heterogeneity of cognitive change at mean age 45, and (in a subset) 3 markers of preclinical AD: amyloid (PIB)-PET, resting state functional connectivity MRI, and tau (F18T807) PET at age 45-65. Such data are not currently available. Framingham Gen 3 participants are grandchildren of the Original cohort (followed since 1948) and children of the Offspring (Gen 2, followed since 1971). Omni 1 & 2 are multiethnic cohorts corresponding to Gen 2 & 3. All cohorts have genetic/epigenetic (GWAS, exome chip and sequencing, blood expression, methylome), lifestyle (diet, mood, hip accelerometry, etc.), vascular/metabolic risk factor and circulating biomarker (e.g., beta-amyloid, clusterin, inflammatory, lipids, adipokines, growth factors) data, verified clinical dementia statu, structural brain MRI (including diffusion tensor imaging [DTI]) and detailed cognitive assessments. Gen 3/Omni 2 (n=4200) participants have already been examined twice (2002-2005 and 2008-2011). These exams included 2 brief cognitive tests (of memory [CERAD word list], and of executive function [Victoria Stroop]) and a brain MRI. We have previously shown that hypertension and diabetes have a greater adverse impact in younger Gen 3 than in Gen 2 participants (2 & 6 years of brain aging in Gen 2, versus 7 & 23 years in Gen 3, respectively). We now propose the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Obtain a brief subjective (AD8) and objective (Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MOCA], repeat Stroop and CERAD word list) cognitive assessment in all Gen 3/Omni 2 (N~3800) at exam 3 (2015-2018) and assess each person's change from 6-7 years earlier. We hypothesize that persons with a high vascular burden and/or high genetic burden of AD will experience the greatest decline in cognition. Aim 2: Obtain amyloid & tau PET and brain structural and fcMRI in 200 persons, aged 45-65 years, with prior MRI, and carefully selected to represent the entire spectrum of vascular risk. We will: assess (2-i) prevalence of amyloid, tau and fcMRI abnormalities at this age and their correlation with cognition, both directly and via an interaction with vascular brain injury; (2-ii) risk factorand circulating biomarker associations with these preclinical imaging markers of AD; also extend/validate the risk factor & biomarker associations with PET/ fcMRI (noted in Gen 3) in subjects >65 yrs with PET/ fcMRI via 4 international collaborations (N~2500). Aim 3: Examine genes, risk factors and biomarkers that we find are associated with PET/ fcMRI for additional association with: (3-i) structural MRI and cognitive measures already available in Gen 1, 2 & 3, e.g., hippocampal volumes, cortical thickness, logical memory (N=4,700); and (3-ii) with risk of developing clinical AD in Gen 1 & 2 participants (up to 1300 AD cases, 750 incident in >7500 persons)."
"9404238","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The classic pathway of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) presentation is important for activation of CD8 T cells, and relies primarily on shuttling cytosolic peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP). This critical role of TAP has made it a prime target for blockade by several human viruses and downregulation in many cancers as a mechanism of evading detection by cytotoxic CD8 T cells. There are, however, other mechanisms of MHC-I presentation that bypass TAP and activate TAP-independent CD8 T cell responses. One of these is cross-presentation, where dendritic cells present peptides derived from extracellular antigens. Although TAP can be important here, cross- presentation can also take place without TAP, but the pathways involved are poorly defined. There are many disease states that result from altered TAP function and their basis is not easily explained by impairment in classic MHC-I presentation. TAP polymorphisms are associated with an increased risk for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a chronic and severe systemic autoimmune disease characterized by high titers of autoantibodies against cellular constituents. TAP mutations in humans lead to TAP deficiency syndrome where surprisingly patients do not exhibit particular susceptibility to viruses but rather suffer from chronic inflammation. Finally, the successful eradication of smallpox is attributed to vaccination with cowpox virus that was recently unexpectedly shown to block TAP. Over the years, we have made significant contributions to understanding the cell biology and regulation of antigen presentation. Using genetic, cell biological, and biochemical approaches, we will pursue 3 aims seeking to delineate the pathways of TAP-independent cross-presentation: Aim 1: We have found that MHC-I reside in special compartments within dendritic cells and their trafficking from these compartments to sites of microbial antigen is regulated by Toll-like receptors, which detect microbial components. We will study how absent TAP impacts the cellular localization and trafficking of MHC-I molecules. Aim 2: We have shown that Toll-like receptors favor the cross-presentation of microbial over self-antigens. We will investigate whether cross-presentation in the absence of TAP is subject to regulation by these receptors. Aim 3: We will study the cross-presentation of both infectious viral and non-infectious cellular antigens by virally infected dendritic cells wher TAP function is impaired. We would like to know whether cross- presentation can rescue MHC-I presentation of viral antigens by the very cells that are infected. We will also determine the ability of these infected cells to confine this presentation to viral and not cellular antigens.  Or basic research here will enable us to identify critical points of regulation in the pathways of MHC-I presentation. We will then be able to design better vaccines for infectious diseases like malaria, tuberculosis or HIV that are best controlled by CD8 T cells. We will also be able to design strategies for intervention in autoimmune diseases like lupus where the presentation of cellular antigens is dysregulated."
"9310909","Project Summary We live in an uncertain world in which events and outcomes are often unpredictable. Being able to flexibly modify our behavior based on our uncertainty about important future outcomes, such as rewards, is critical for survival. Many studies have reported that reward uncertainty modulates behavioral and emotional states, and that improper evaluation of uncertainty is associated with maladaptive behaviors, such as risk-seeking, anxiety, and addiction. Recent evidence suggests that within the brain there are populations of neurons devoted to signaling uncertainty. But how this signal is broadcast and utilized is unknown. We will test the hypothesis that the basal forebrain (BF) plays a major role in broadcasting this signal. We will further test the idea that medial and dorsal-lateral subregions of BF differentially contribute to the regulation of behavior in uncertain contexts. In Aim 1, we will test whether and how different subregions of the primate BF signal and combine information about uncertainty and value. The medial BF is thought to be crucial for learning and monitoring of important events, and dorsal-lateral portions of the BF, known as the ventral pallidum or the ventral-rostral globus pallidus, are thought to regulate motivation. If this is true, then it seems likely that these two BF subregions might represent uncertainty in very different ways. Next, we propose to examine how the differential representations of uncertainty and value in different regions of the BF contribute to behavior. If dorsal-lateral BF regulates motivation, then it is possible that uncertainty-signals there modulate uncertainty-related behaviors, such as risk-seeking. To test this hypothesis, we will study BF activity while monkeys choose between certain and uncertain rewards. Preliminary data support the hypothesis that dorsal-lateral BF's uncertainty representation is correlated with risky-choices, while medial BF's uncertainty signals emerge after the risky choice, while the subject awaits the choice-outcome. Finally, we will transiently inactivate different subregions of BF to causally test how the differential neuronal encoding of uncertainty in those regions contributes to choice behavior. In Aim 2 we will test whether a major input to the dorsal-lateral BF, the striatum, is a source of the uncertainty signal we observed there. Based on data gathered during preliminary experiments, we hypothesize that uncertainty coding neurons clustered in the internal capsule bordering region of the striatum could be the source of uncertainty modulation observed in dorsal-lateral BF. To causally test this hypothesis, the last experiment in Aim 2 will assess whether inactivation of this striatal area reduces the uncertainty sensitivity of neurons in the BF. Uncertainty about rewards modulates motivation and decision making. Our proposed experiments will provide crucial information about the neuronal mechanisms of behavioral modulation by uncertainty. Understanding these mechanisms in primates provides a crucial linkage to understanding human neuropsychiatric diseases.  "
"9402418","Project Summary/Abstract  The pyridine heterocycle is a privileged motif that appears in countless natural products, drugs, and materials. As the most prevalent heterocyclic aromatic ring in chemical therapeutics, the pyridine motif is featured in a plethora of blockbuster drugs such as Xalkori, Prilosec, and Zytiga. Due to the enormous prevalence of pyridines in human life, new and innovative methodologies to access this motif remain highly sought after. Numerous preparative methods require specialized starting materials and also necessitate strictly defined substitution patterns, which limit structural diversity. Conversely, transforming readily available and inexpensive precursors, that have all substitution intact, directly to the pyridine scaffold would constitute a simple, flexible, and powerful means to access these frameworks. The proposed research aims to develop a directed aziridination methodology in a continuous flow reactor that would allow access to pyridines from readily available phenol starting materials. This transformation has been historically challenging because of the nonregioselective aziridination of the arene ring with nitrene sources, which leads to complex mixtures of products. This powerful new strategy will rely on a directed aziridination to provide regioselectivity in the event. Continuous flow techniques will prove critical to this key transformation in order to avoid various undesired reaction pathways by means that are unparalleled in standard batch synthesis. Finally, a ring contraction process would then furnish libraries of highly valued pyridines in a multi-step, one-flow approach."
"9391508","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nephrology Training Grant The purpose of the Duke Training Grant in Nephrology is to provide intensive research training for postdoctoral fellows focusing on areas that relate to normal kidney physiology, the pathogenesis of kidney diseases and hypertension. The primary goal of the program is to produce academic physicians as well as basic, translational and clinical scientists with investigative expertise in nephrology and hypertension. The program provides diverse opportunities for training in both basic and clinical research which in turn, permits trainees to develop the skills and flexibility necessary to respond to research demands in nephrology over the coming years. Our faculty have a wide range of interests and expertise in an array of disciplines providing integrated training in physiology, molecular and cellular biology, biochemistry, and technologies relating to genetically modified mice. For trainees interested in clinical research, ongoing programs in biometrics, decision analysis, human genetics and metabolomics provide a basis for rigorous evaluation of clinical issues related to hypertension and diseases of the kidney. We believe that the acquisition of research skills required to become a successful physician scientist is best accomplished by two to three years of intensive laboratory experience working closely with a quality preceptor. The research program is, therefore, structured to maximize time in the laboratory under the supervision of a mentor. For trainees with M.D. degrees, the program is designed to provide one year of clinical training followed by at least two years of research training that will be supporte by funds requested in this application. Formal course work, research seminars, and journal clubs supplement this laboratory experience. We anticipate that the levels of experience for trainees participating in the program will encompass fellows with minimal research experience to fellows with advanced research training including fellows with Ph.D. degrees. We are requesting funds to support three postdoctoral positions per year for fellows who will undertake at least two years of concurrent research training. Completion of this program should allow trainees to pursue careers in academic medicine with the skills to conduct high-quality research in clinical, translational and basic aspects of nephrology."
"9383155","Core A: PI: David L. Ayares, PhD  Abstract:   Precise genetic manipulation of the pig genome through a combination of somatic cell  nuclear transfer and sophisticated gene modification tools offers the opportunity to provide an  unlimited source of human-compatible donor organs, cells, and tissues for transplantation. As  Core A, Revivicor will apply their advanced transgenic pig production platform to provide the GE  source pig organs (kidney, heart, lung, and liver) necessary to meet the goals of the specific  aims in Project 1 and Project 2. Elimination of immunogenic Gal?1,3Gal (Gal) sugars through  inactivation of the ?1,3-galactosyl transferase gene (GTKO) was a critical first step, resulting in  the elimination of hyperacute rejection (HAR), and prolonged survival of xenografts in non-  human primate studies, compared to wild-type controls. To provide further protection protection  from non-gal-mediated humoral rejection, next-generation GTKO pigs were produced with  constitutive high-level expression of the complement regulatory genes, hCD46 and hCD55,  individually and as triple transgenic pigs. In addition, for inhibition of coagulation and  thrombosis, human anti-coagulant genes (EPCR, CD39, TFPI, and thrombomodulin), under  endothelial cell-specific promoter systems, were added alone or in combination to produce  donor pigs with up to six genetic modifications.   The use of multi-cistronic ?2A? vectors has facilitated the production of these multi-  transgenic pigs in which the added genes are not only co-expressed, but co-integrated in the  genome, thus allowing propagation of new lines with reduced transgene segregation. Core A  will utilize this multi-transgenic 2A pig platform to produce multiple combinations of six-gene  (6GE) pigs that have already shown improved efficacy, and will further modify the source pig to  inhibit T cell activation (expression of a dominant negative inhibitor of SLA class II (CIITA), and  immunomodulation, through overexpression of the ?cloaking gene?, human CD47, to prevent  activation of monocytes and other immune cells. In addition, towards prevention of  spontaneous aggregation and sequestration of recipient platelets (and resulting  thrombocytopenia in NHP), specific exons of porcine vWF will be replaced by their human  equivalents using gene editing nuclease technologies. Core A will identify the optimal multi-  gene mix, with an efficacious balance of gene expression levels, bioactivity, and synergistic  effects, while maintaining a healthy herd, as needed to support the aims of Project 1 & 2."
"9210077","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal regulation of glycemia (dysglycemia) has a very long time course, from its earliest stage, labeled pre-diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The 11-year follow-up DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the relatively brief 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Prevention was cost-saving with MET and cost-effective with ILS. Overall, the risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (A1C). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those who had A1C ?6.5% at study end.  The proposed DPPOS Phase 3 will study the DPPOS cohort for 10 more years, taking advantage of the long-term randomized exposure to MET and the densely phenotyped and genotyped DPPOS cohort (n=2778), which includes nearly 1600 patients with known T2D duration and ~1200 who have not developed T2D, to address yet unanswered questions about long-term exposure to MET and ILS initiated during pre-diabetes. DPPOS Phase 3 will examine outcomes that are of increasing public health concern in the aging population with pre-diabetes and T2D, including the putative benefits of MET on development of CVD and cancer. The main goals of DPPOS Phase 3 are to examine efficiently: 1) the long-term effects of metformin therapy begun in the pre-diabetic phase on risk for CVD and cancer; 2) the long-term effects by intention-to-treat of ILS and MET on further development of T2D and on traditional and more recently recognized complications of dysglycemia, and of their economic impact; and 3) the clinical course of dysglycemia, evaluated by categorical diagnoses (pre-diabetes vs diabetes) and as a continuum, and their associations with the development of complications, including analyses of interactions with DPP interventions and established and novel risk factors."
"9346955","The obligate intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii is a major opportunistic infection of AIDS patients. Toxoplasma also causes devastating disease to fetuses and other immunocompromised patients. While much work has focused on identifying and characterizing Toxoplasma proteins and pathways important for growth and virulence of this intracellular pathogen, less is known about which host cell pathways are rate- limiting for parasite growth. Identification of these host cell processes is important because if we can inhibit them or the parasite processes dependent on them from functioning then we can block parasite growth and disease. Modulation of host cell transcription is a common mechanism to make the host cell?s environment permissive for pathogen growth. Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1 (HIF-1) is one example of a host cell transcription that is activated by Toxoplasma infection and is required for parasite growth. In the previous funding period, we found that HIF-1 is activated by Toxoplasma triggering the nuclear export and subsequent lysosomal degradation of the PHD2 protein, which is the key negative regulator of HIF-1. Decreases in PHD2 protein is achieved by the parasite activating a host cell receptor named Activin Like Kinase 4 (ALK4). Finally, we discovered that HIF-1 promotes Toxoplasma growth by upregulating the host glycolytic hexokinase 2. In this proposal we will establish how Toxoplasma stimulates PHD2 nuclear export and lysosomal degradation, what ligand binds to ALK4, and how hexokinase 2 acts to promote parasite growth. These studies are likely to provide important information regarding the interaction between Toxoplasma and its host cell."
"9407989","Project Summary  The fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans is estimated to cause disease in more than 1,000,000 people worldwide every year, resulting in greater than 600,000 deaths. However, not all Cryptococcus isolates are killers; some are relatively benign while oth- ers are hypervirulent. Differences in pathogenicity are often correlated with variation in key morphological and physiological features such as the ability to grow at high tem- peratures, the size of the protective polysaccharide capsule surrounding the yeast cell, or resistance to antifungal drugs. In order to develop better ways to prevent and treat cryptococcal disease we need to understand the underlying genetic differences that lead to changes in virulence and virulence-related traits. We also need to understand how frequently and how wide spread these genetic differences are in different parts of the world.  To tackle these problems, the proposed research will use a combination of experi- mental and statistical approaches to dissect the causal genetic basis of variation in vir- ulence and virulence-related traits. In Aim 1 the investigators will employ a statistical technique called Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) mapping, that exploits genotypic and phenotypic differences among offspring derived from genetic crosses to identify regions of the genome (loci) and DNA changes (alleles) that contribute to differences in virulence traits. The investigators will validate the contributions of the loci identi?ed in this man- ner using gene deletions and related techniques. In Aim 2 the investigators will subject genetically diverse populations of Cryptococcus to selection in animal hosts. Following selection, pooled genome sequencing will be used to identify loci and alleles that are favoring during infection. This technique provides an unbiased approach for discover- ing loci that contribute to virulence, and will both complement and extend the results of Aim 1. In Aim 3 the investigators will put their ?ndings in the context of natural populations of Cryptococcus by studying the frequency and geographic distributions of virulence alleles identi?ed in Aims 1 and 2. This aim will employ a large, world-wide sample of Cryptococcus strains isolated both from clinical settings and from the natural environment. The investigators will use this information to identify regions of the world where there are high frequencies of virulent genotypes, or where there is potential for in- creased virulence through processes like recombination or hybridization. 1"
"9211082","ABSTRACT The aims of this proposal are to (1) enable the candidate to further develop her research program focused on improving advance care planning (ACP) and informed medical decision making for vulnerable older adults and (2) use her research program as a platform for mentoring junior investigators interested in patient-oriented aging research, both within Geriatrics and other medical subspecialties. The candidate is a Geriatrician and Palliative Medicine physician who has established a high-impact independent clinical research program that is well funded with an outstanding publication record. In the 10 years since completing her Geriatrics fellowship, she has established herself as a successful mentor of students, fellows, and junior faculty who have published high-impact aging research, become successfully funded, and continue to participate in patient-oriented research in aging. The candidate has developed an extensive research portfolio focused on creating and testing literacy- and culturally appropriate health education materials to improve ACP and medical decision making for older adults. She developed a broader paradigm of ACP that focuses not only on one-time treatment decisions, such as for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), but also on the process of preparing patients to communicate their wishes and to participate with clinicians in making real-time, complex medical decisions over the course of illness. She operationalized this paradigm into an easy-to-understand, patient- centered website called PREPARE that teaches patients, through videos, how to identify their wishes and communicate with surrogates and clinicians. The candidate received R01 funding from the NIA to test the efficacy of the PREPARE website to engage diverse, vulnerable older adults from an urban, county hospital in ACP using validated patient questionnaires. This K24 proposal will provide the candidate with protected time to expand her research in a new direction focused on direct observation (i.e., audio recording) of patient-clinician communication within primary care encounters in response to the PREPARE intervention. This new research will determine whether a patient-centered ACP website can empower and activate patients to discuss ACP and to facilitate communication with their primary care providers. The candidate will also develop her formal mentoring program with plans for the recruitment, selection, development, and evaluation of mentees who will become leaders in aging research. She will work with each mentee to establish a focused career development plan in which they complete research projects and develop the skills needed to become independent investigators. These plans will make full use of the outstanding clinical research training environment at UCSF. She will leverage her leadership positions at UCSF to recruit more mentees interested in research on ACP and aging in vulnerable populations."

The discipline of gene therapy has had its ups and downs, but to continue to advance the field, we must train the next generation of investigators in this area. The aim of this program is to continue to train this next generation of scientists in the clinically-relevant medical area of gene transfer for effective modulation of normal and abnormal cell growth and for gene therapy to correct blood diseases. We request 4 pre- and 5 post-doctoral slots, an increase of 1 pre-doc slot. We have an outstanding group of 23 very productive, interactive, and well-respected investigators as mentors with their primary and/or secondary faculty appointments in 8 departments of the medical school. These mentors have over their career trained a total of 169 pre-doctoral PhD and 284 post-doctoral students. Since the competitive renewal of this program in 2009, we were able to train and/or are in the process of training 11 pre- and 13 post-doctoral students, who have published 112 papers [37 (Pre-Doc) and 75 (Post-Doc)]. The Program Director (PD) has trained 17 pre-doctoral and 55 post- doctoral/clinical fellows, has published over 720 papers and been continuously funded by the NIH since 1978. He is a recognized authority on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, the regulation of hematopoiesis, and has had his work translated into clinical utility. The Co-PD, is also a well-recognized and well-funded productive investigator who has trained numerous students and fellows, and has had his work translated for clinical benefit. The PD and Co-PD have extensive administrative experience and have worked for many years in the area of gene transfer in efforts to enhance approaches to gene therapy. The vast majority of our trainees, since initial funding of this grant in 1999, have gone on to careers in academia and other research intensive areas of employment. Training of our pre- and post-doctoral students entails one-on-one interactions, committee and group mentorship, lab meetings, special seminars in the area of this training program, didactic courses, ethical training, presentations at scientific meetings and high expectations for the trainees to publish in respected scientific and medical journals, and to continue in their career development leading them to become productive independent investigators whose work will benefit healthcare in general and gene transfer/gene therapy in specific. Our training efforts are monitored and enhanced by both internal and external advisory committees."
"9255123","Antimicrobial resistance is a major public health problem worldwide. Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Ng), the causative agent of the sexually transmitted infection gonorrhea, has become multidrug-resistant and has achieved ?superbug? status. Novel therapeutics against Ng are urgently needed. Complement (C?) is a key arm of innate immune defenses. A mechanism used by several pathogens, including Ng, to escape C? is to bind to a host C? inhibitor called factor H (FH). FH comprises 20 domains, arranged in an extended head-to-tail fashion. Only the four N-terminal domains (domains 1-4) possess C? inhibiting activity; the remainder of the molecule is important for recognition of host surfaces. Many pathogens, including Ng, bind FH through domains 6-7 and/or 19-20. A recombinant fusion of FH domains 18-20 to IgG Fc (FH18-20/Fc) promotes C?-dependent killing of Ng. Domains 19 and 20, in the context of full-length FH, bind to host cells and protect them from damage by C?. Introducing a D?G amino acid mutation in domain 19 of FH18-20/Fc to yield FH(18-20)*/Fc retained anti-Ng efficacy but abrogated C?-mediated lysis of host cells. Topically administered FH(18-20)*/Fc attenuated Ng infection in the mouse vaginal colonization model. Planet Biotechnology Inc. (PBI) has pioneered the production of functional antibodies and Fc-fusion proteins in tobacco plants (Nicotiana benthamiana). Production of large quantities of functional FH(18-20)*/Fc in plants at relatively low costs compared to traditional mammalian cell culture systems constitutes an ideal platform for developing anti- infective immunotherapeutics. In Aim 1, PBI will produce four FH(18-20)*/Fc molecules differing in their Fc: three with human Fc (hFc) for studies in vitro and one with mouse Fc (mFc) for studies in mice. The three different hFc's fused to FH(18-20)* will be: i) Fc from IgG1 (equivalent to what has been produced in CHO cells); ii) a linear ?? chimera, comprising IgG1 Fc plus CH2 and CH3 from IgA2; and iii) Fc from IgA2. We expect human IgA2 Fc to increase ADCC by engaging Fc?RI on human neutrophils. In Aim 2, UMass will examine the ability of the three FH(18-20)*/hFc's described above to i) bind to, ii) deposit C3 on, iii) effect C? dependent killing of and iv) support opsonophagocytosis of drug-resistant Ng. The efficacy of FH(18-20)*/mFc against Ng will be tested in the mouse vaginal colonization model using human FH transgenic BALB/c mice. The use of these novel mice will evaluate the therapeutic in the context of human FH, as would occur in humans. We also speculate that FH(18-20)*/Fc may guide bacteria to Fc receptors on antigen presenting cells and elicit an immune response that may protect mice against reinfection. This possibility will be addressed by re-infecting the mice following FH(18-20)*/Fc (or control) treatment. We envision the use of FH(18-20)*/Fc either as a topical prophylactic in women at high risk for gonorrhea, or as a parenteral adjunctive anti-infective. While this proposal focuses on Ng, we believe FH(18-20)*/Fc will be useful against several medically important drug-resistant pathogens that bind to human FH."
"9318763","PROJECT SUMMARY  The long-term goal of this project is to understand how epithelial stem cells in the skin establish distinct patterns of gene activation and silencing during their differentiation into specialized cell lineages and how these genetic programs are re-organized during skin regeneration and tumorigenesis.  It is now widely accepted that in addition to signaling/transcription factor-mediated mechanisms, lineage- specific gene expression programs are also regulated epigenetically, i.e., via covalent DNA/histone modifications, as well as via spatial arrangements of the genes and their enhancer elements in the nucleus.  Enhancer-promoter interactions serve as key determinants providing functional and structural frameworks for cell-specific transcription controlled by lineage-specific transcription factors. However, enhancer-promoter regulatory networks are substantially re-organized during cell transition towards malignancy, which include an aberrant exposure of gene promoters to inappropriate regulatory elements resulting in activation of pro- oncogenes, as well as in silencing of the tumor suppressor genes.  CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) serves as one of the core architectural proteins that plays a key role in the control the establishment and maintenance of enhancer/promoter interactions. CTCF gene is frequently mutated in cancers, and abrogation of its tumor-suppressor activity contributes to cancer development and progression.  Our preliminary data demonstrate that CTCF is expressed in both mouse and human epidermis, while Krt14-driven Ctcf genetic ablation results in severe alterations in skin development, epidermal barrier maintenance, and tumorigenesis. In this multi-PI proposal, we will test a hypothesis that CTCF serves as critical determinant that control the establishment and maintenance of the enhancer-promoter regulatory networks in skin epithelial stem cells and their progenies during development and postnatal homeostasis, while alterations in such networks result in skin tumorigenesis. We will address this hypothesis via two Specific Aims:  1. Define the roles of CTCF in the establishment and maintenance of lineage-specific higher-order chromatin structure, enhancer-promoter regulatory networks and gene expression in distinct populations of skin epithelial cells during development and hair cycle-associated skin regeneration.  2. Delineate the roles for Ctcf in regulation of gene expression, 3D chromatin organization and enhancer-promoter interactions in the skin epithelial cells during tumorigenesis.  This project will have a fundamental impact on our current knowledge of epigenetic mechanisms that regulate genome reorganization in stem cells during their differentiation and tumorigenesis and will promote the progress towards the development of novel epigenetic drugs as a new paradigm for treatment of skin disorders."
"9259069","Project Summary: This research addresses a fundamental question in cell biology: How do cells detect mechanical stress in the actin cytoskeleton? The internal cytoskeletal tension is modulated by the mechanical properties of its external environment. Cytoskeletal tension can be an internal representation the mechanical properties of its local environment that can be ?read? by the biochemical machinery. In fact proteins can be stretched by mechanical forces to reveal new binding sites, the recognition of these newly revealed binding sites by ?sensor? proteins is one possible way of detecting mechanical information. The LIM superfamily represents a large number of putative mechanosensitive cellular proteins that detect stress by a completely unknown mechanism. I aim to identify the sequence determinants within the LIM domain responsible for detection of mechanical stress in the actin cytoskeleton. I then aim to discover the molecular mechanisms by which LIM domain proteins detect this stress, including identifying what LIM domains bind to and the nature of the deformation in the actin cytoskeleton. Revealing the mechanism of how a single member of this family detects cytoskeletal deformations will likely be generalizable to a large number of proteins. This will also drive future research involving how mechanosensitivity of each LIM protein is tuned and specificity achieved."
"9254786","Recent advances in DNA sequencing technology have not been matched by improved analytic techniques to quickly and accurately interpret patient genome data to inform diagnosis, prognosis and therapy-making decisions in the clinic and to identify candidate biomarkers of disease in research laboratories. Development of automated techniques to facilitate interpretation of this data will benefit patient care and improve public health by promoting widespread use of cost-efficient sequencing clinically and by making it feasible to sequence a broader range of patients including those with complex disease or to identify patients who have an elevated risk of developing future disease. Our long-term goal is to commoditize sequence interpretation using high- throughput computational techniques in the same way that next-generation DNA sequencing technology has commoditized genome data production. The present project will result in commercial software that automates genome sequence interpretation. Specifically, we will develop (1) software that automatically collects and organizes a comprehensive set of genetic information by systematically reading millions of scientific articles and scanning dozens of genetic variant databases; (2) software that uses this information to prioritize patient data into clinical categories based on the likelihood of disease; and (3) software that automatically identifies candidate biomarkers of disease from multi-sample cohort data. To do this we will use a variety of innovative data processing techniques. First, we will systematically mutate the reference genome in silico to produce a comprehensive database of every possible mutation at every position of every gene and use this data to query every word of every article ever published or any publicly available database to identify disease-gene-variant associations. We will compare the results from this automated process to results obtained using more expensive and time-consuming manual methods and hypothesize that we can achieve 95% concordance and identify 33% more variants and 3-fold more references for each. These results will be organized into clinically meaningful categories and presented in an interactive graphical interface that displays the evidence for each of these associations. We will then use this information to drive prioritization of patient data based on similarities to known disease-causing variants and the strength of evidence for their pathogenicity in order to increase analytic sensitivity and specificity thereby improving speed and reliability of sequencing in the clinic. Our automated results will then be compared to conventional methods of data annotation and filtration for >1,100 patient samples from 4 diseases. Finally, we will use the same prioritization strategy to comprehensively compare variant data between all patients within a disease cohort to automatically identify the variants most likely to lead to disease and compare our automated results to conventional methods for >600 samples from 10 diseases. The growth in the $3.6B genome sequencing market is driven by improvements in informatics techniques and automated solutions such as proposed here have significant commercial potential."
"9391400","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a revised application for a T32 grant, Research Training in Biobehavioral Disturbances of Eating Disorders. The primary goal of this proposal is to train postdoctoral (MD, MD/PhD, and PhD) fellows for careers as independent researchers in Eating Disorders. An intensive two-to-three-year program is outlined in which fellows will learn how to identify key research questions, formulate hypotheses, and design and execute experiments that effectively test those hypotheses. In the course of training, fellows will acquire a range of skills relevant to research methodology, including expertise in experimental design and statistical analysis relevant to clinical research. Graduating fellows will be able to present research projects clearly in both written and oral forms as evidenced by publications and presentations. The training program outlined, utilizing the outstanding faculty at Columbia University and associated collaborators at nearby Weill Cornell Medical College, offers a unique opportunity to future researchers in the field of eating disorders. The Columbia Eating Disorders Research Unit has a long track record of recruiting and successfully training clinical researchers with its success reflected in high rates of its trainees receiving K awards and pursuing full-time academic careers. Also, the Columbia program has been highly successful at recruiting MD researchers into the field of eating disorders, making it an unusual training program in this specialized area. While research fellows specializing in eating disorders at Columbia have previously been trained using two other T32 programs, these programs have shifted their emphasis to basic science and neuroscience research, and have therefore been more reluctant to accept candidates with interests in the field of eating disorders whose areas of research focus have included the pathophysiology and behavioral disturbances associated with eating disorders, or treatment development research. The NIMH has identified eating disorders as an understudied area in need of research initiatives. This application outlines a training plan for future researchers in this important clinical area."
"9393159","Financial incentives for motivating changes in health behavior, for weight loss in obese individuals, are increasingly being tested by health insurers, employers, and government agencies. However, a key unanswered question regarding weight loss is how to structure these incentive programs to maximize their (1) effectiveness, underscored by the fact that most programs have not resulted in significant long-term weight loss; and (2) economic sustainability, as defined by their return on investment?a major factor in public and private decision-making. Obese patients represent an important population to target for effective weight loss interventions because they suffer from a high prevalence of serious obesity-related illnesses?including diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, heart disease, stroke, sleep apnea, and cancer?disproportionately have a low socioeconomic status, and impose $147 billion in costs on the healthcare system annually. While prior studies testing financial incentives in this population have had variable short-term success and few have yielded long-term weight loss, a fundamental question remains unanswered and may partially explain variability in weight loss outcomes: specifically, it is unknown whether goal-directed incentives (incentives for achieving evidence-based, intermediate goals that increase weight loss but are underutilized, like dietary counseling, physical activity, behavioral self monitoring, and intensive weight management programs) or outcome-based incentives (like incentives for successfully losing weight) are more effective for promoting weight loss. Prior studies of weight loss incentives have largely emphasized only the latter. We propose a three-arm randomized controlled trial that will address this important knowledge gap among obese patients living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods, with implications for other serious chronic health conditions. Comparing goal-directed incentives to outcome-based incentives and usual care, we will assess their impact on weight loss (?5% of baseline weight), use of evidenced-based therapy, and quality of life, and evaluate their short-term and long-term return on investment."
"9308346","ABSTRACT Ischemic stroke patients with Diabetes mellitus (DM) exhibit a distinct risk-factor and etiologic profile and a worse neurovascular prognosis than non-DM patients. Therefore, there is a compelling need to investigate neurovascular changes after stroke in the DM and non-DM population and to develop therapeutic approaches specifically designed to reduce neurological deficits after stroke. Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) constitutes 90% of diabetic patients and is associated with low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), impairment of the anti-oxidative capacity of HDL-C, low phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (p-eNOS), and with reduced ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) gene expression. D-4F is an economical apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) mimetic peptide, presently employed in clinical trials to reduce coronary atherosclerosis in patients with acute coronary syndrome. However, the therapeutic effects of D-4F in post-ischemic stroke have not been investigated. Our preliminary data show that D-4F treatment of stroke starting 2h or 24h after ischemic stroke improves recovery of neurological function in both T2DM and non-DM mice and also increases p-eNOS and ABCA1 in the ischemic brain. In a novel and clinically relevant approach, based on our robust preliminary data, we propose to use D-4F in the treatment of stroke in the non-DM and T2DM population in mice. We seek to develop D-4F as a novel neurorestorative therapy to reduce white matter (WM) dysfunction and vascular damage, in T2DM and non-DM mice when treatment is initiated at 24h after onset of ischemic stroke. In addition, most development of stroke treatments has focused on young adult animals, but not on old animals, the prevalent population with stroke. Increased age also increases neurological impairment after stroke. We have also developed and implemented multimodality MRI imaging which can dynamically monitor neurovascular remodeling in both the animal and the patient. In the current study, we will measure WM and vascular changes and elucidate the mechanisms of action of D-4F in young adult and aged animals with and without T2DM after stroke. Our hypothesis is that D-4F increases ABCA1 and p-eNOS signaling activity which mediates vascular and WM remodeling and in concert improve functional outcome after stroke. We, therefore, propose two highly integrated and longitudinally designed Specific Aims. Aim 1 will investigate the delayed (24h after stroke) therapeutic effects of D-4F in non-DM and T2DM in young adult and aged mice after stroke. The differences in cerebral WM and vascular changes, and neurological functional outcome after stroke between non-DM and T2DM mice treated with or without D-4F will be analyzed. MRI will be employed to measure the dynamics of neurovascular reorganization underlying therapeutic response and recovery. In Aim 2, using eNOS knockout mice and specific loss of brain ABCA1 mice, we will investigate the mechanisms by which D-4F promotes neurovascular remodeling and hence, neurological recovery. The long-term objective of this RO1 is to develop a neurorestorative treatment for stroke in patients with or without diabetes."
"9259732","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over half a million coronary interventions are performed every year in the US. However, the growing population of diabetic patients have a 30% increased risk of restenosis due to neointimal hyperplasia after coronary intervention, demonstrating that effective treatment for diabetic patients remains a major issue in cardiovascular medicine. A major contributor to diabetic vascular disease is mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS), due to an excess of metabolic substrates and overload of mitochondrial respiration. Recently, Ca2+/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) was found in mitochondria, where it signals through mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) to increase Ca2+ entry into mitochondria. Ca2+ influx into mitochondria is known to drive metabolism through the Krebs cycle and the electron transport chain. Sustained mtROS elevations lead to global ROS increases, which promote vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation, a major contributor to neointimal hyperplasia. The objective of my application is to determine how CaMKII in VSMC regulates mitochondrial metabolism and ROS production in diabetes and directly test whether its inhibition in mitochondria abrogates neointimal hyperplasia in diabetes in vivo. I hypothesize that mitochondrial CaMKII promotes neointimal hyperplasia in diabetes through increased mitochondrial ROS production resulting from ineffective metabolic activity. To test this hypothesis, I will utilize an in vivo model of diabetes in mice with VSMC-specific mitochondrial CaMKII inhibition (mtCaMKIIN mice) to discover if they have less mtROS, less mitochondrial Ca2+ loading and protection from neointimal hyperplasia. I will also dissect the mechanism for mtCaMKII's role in mitochondrial metabolism of VSMC, using cutting edge techniques to assess metabolic activity. My studies will test the hypothesis through two specific aims: 1) test whether mtCaMKII inhibition reduces neointimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus; 2) determine the mechanisms by which mtCaMKII controls mtROS production and metabolic activity. These studies will establish how mitochondrial CaMKII and mitochondrial Ca2+ contribute to mtROS production in diabetic restenosis and to determine whether these represent viable targets for future therapeutic development."
"9208103","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease in the synovium. We found that cadherin-11 (cad-11), a homophilic cell adhesion molecule expressed on synovial fibroblasts, mediates their adhesion to form the architecture of the synovial lining and stromal network of the sublining synovium. In RA, the lining layer undergoes massive hyperplasia and activation and gives rise to the pannus that degrades the cartilage. The synovial sublining becomes chronically infiltrated with leukocytes (T and B cells, macrophages, mast cells). We hypothesize that longterm support for such leukocytic infiltrates may be dependent on the tissue stromal network and its products, which in the synovium may be provided by cadherin-11 expressing fibroblasts. Our recent work shows that targeting cad-11 on synovial fibroblasts not only alters synovial architecture, but also markedly abrogates inflammation in arthritis models in mice. Further, we found that selective cad-11 engagement on the surface of fibroblasts activates their MAP kinase and NF-?B pathways to elicit a variety of cytokines and chemokines known to promote inflammation. Thus, synovial fibroblasts influence inflammation, and they can be targeted in animal models via the mesenchymal cadherin-11 they express. Here, we propose to define the mechanisms by which synovial fibroblasts and cad-11 regulate macrophages and Th17 cells that are relevant to RA. First, we will define the key cytokines and chemokines made by human synovial fibroblast subsets corresponding to lining and sublining fibroblasts in vitro under basal conditions and after they are stimulated by inflammatory cytokines as are found in RA (Aim 1). Second, we will determine the role of cad-11 on fibroblasts in 2D and 3D organ cultures in modulating the activation and inflammatory phenotype of macrophages (Aim 2). Then, we will determine the role of cad-11 and the synovial fibroblasts together with macrophages in regulating IL-6 and IL-1ß production that impact Th17 cell differentiation (Aim 3). Finally, to determine if fibroblast regulation of macrophage inflammatory phenotype and Th17 differentiation defined above in vitro in human cells also are relevant in vivo, we will determine how targeting cad-11 alters macrophage and T cell phenotypes in the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model in mice (Aim 4). Together, these studies will provide important new insights into mechanisms and potential therapies aimed at stromal fibroblasts and inflammation in arthritis."
"9296756","PROJECT SUMMARY The alarming spread of tuberculosis (TB), and co-epidemic of HIV-associated TB, are global health concerns. Despite the availability of effective anti-mycobacterial and anti-viral therapy, growing drug-resistance, and increased morbidity and mortality associated with HIV co-infection, have prompted an exigent need to develop innovative therapies. A key feature of host immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) is the formation of aggregates of immune cells called granulomas, predominantly in the lungs, which provide the microenvironment in which infections are contained, but which also allow for pathogen persistence and ultimate reactivation of dormant infection, as seen in HIV. We hypothesize that by dampening host immunosuppressive responses mediated by regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC), and by eliminating immune cells that engulf and harbor M.tb, the host immune response could be tipped towards a predominantly anti-mycobacterial one leading ultimately to eradication of infection. In this study, we propose to test the efficacy of new and improved preparations of DAB389mIL-2 (Ontak®) and DAB389mIL-4, specific diphtheria toxin-based cytokine receptor targeted fusion proteins generated in our laboratory, in the selective elimination of cells, such as Tregs and MDSC, expressing IL2-R and IL-4R respectively. We will evaluate them as host directed therapeutics in mouse models of TB and of M.tb/HIV co-infection in order to develop them further for primate model studies and human clinical trials. ."
"9420193","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) is an oncogenic human herpesvirus, which causes Kaposi sarcoma (KS) as well as B cell lymphomas in the absence of adequate immune control. KSHV-associated tumors are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in transplant patients and individuals with HIV-disease. The oral cavity is an important site for KSHV replication and persistence and saliva is believed to be a critical source of person-to-person transmission. Moreover, oral manifestation of KS is associated with rapid progression and high mortality rates. KSHV-associated tumors are multi-focal and frequently polyclonal, suggesting that continued viral infection is important for disease progression. Because of technical challenges unique to KSHV molecular virology, little is known about infection of physiologically relevant cell types. The current project will leverage new molecular genetics tools to explore the fundamental virology of KSHV infection with the goal of identifying novel viral and cellular targets to prevent viral spread and KS progression within the oral cavity. During the K99 phase, we will establish systems for de novo infection of KSHV-susceptible cell types and tissues in order to explore the cell type-specific properties of infectin, persistence and spread. We will then utilize these models to explore the contribution of the viral FLICE- inhibitory protein (vFLIP) in the context of KSHV infection. In order to place these studies in the most disease-relevant context possible, we will include HIV co-infection, as appropriate, to determine fundamental interactions between these two pathogens. With critical training and career development accomplished, model systems in hand, and the vFLIP studies as proof-of-principle for the use of recombinant KSHV strains within these models, I will move forward in the R00 phase to examine the contribution of virion-associated non-structural KSHV proteins to the earliest stages of infection in relevant cell types. These packaged, non-structural proteins comprise a virion structure known as the tegument. Tegument factors affect profound alterations in host cell physiology immediately upon virus entry and studies of these factors in other herpesvirus systems have yielded important insights into viral and cellular biology. However, the composition and function of the KSHV tegument remains obscure and represents a large gap in our understanding of fundamental KSHV virology. The results of this research will provide critical information about the dynamic process of KSHV persistence in the oral cavity and provide insights into both viral and cellular mechanisms that can be exploited for new treatment paradigms. Using a broad but systematic workflow of study for multiple KSHV tegument factors, I will obtain a significant body of both publishable data and preliminary data for multiple future studies that will provide a solid foundation upon which to build an independent research career."
"9209969","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Androgen receptor signaling is crucial for normal female reproduction and hyperandrogenemia is a fundamental aspect of the reproductive disruption seen in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). Either lack of androgen receptor or androgen excess disrupts normal ovulation and neuroendocrine control of female reproduction, but the mechanisms for these effects are unknown. Our overall hypotheses are: 1) androgens acting in the brain and pituitary play an important role in regulating normal female fertility, and2) excess androgens, acting through androgen receptor in the hypothalamus and pituitary, are responsible for the neuroendocrine hallmarks of PCOS: high LH, low FSH, and progesterone (P4) resistance. We will test these hypotheses in a series of three independent but interrelated Aims that focus on the role of physiological androgen signaling and androgen excess in the hypothalamus and pituitary, using a combination of genetic and androgen-excess mouse models. Approaches will utilize genetic manipulation of androgen and P4 signaling in specific cell types in normal female mice and in a novel mouse model of obese PCOS. Aim 1 will focus on the brain by assessing whether androgen receptor (AR) is required specifically in neurons for normal female reproduction and for the deleterious effects of androgen excess. Using Cre-loxP technology, AR will be selectively deleted from brain neurons, and subsequently specifically from kisspeptin neurons. Females lacking AR in these neurons will be investigated for resistance to the effects of androgen excess in the new PCOS mouse model. Aim 2 will focus on the pituitary, with the hypothesis that excess androgens act directly at the gonadotrope to dysregulate LH? and FSH? and gonadotropin secretion in females. Female mice lacking AR selectively in the gonadotrope will be studied for altered reproductive function and gonadotropin secretion and in response to excess androgens in the PCOS mouse model. We will use primary pituitary cells in an innovative GnRH pulse system to directly test the actions of androgens on basal and GnRH-induced pulses of LH and FSH and gonadotropin gene expression. Aim 3 will test whether androgen excess interferes with P4 feedback at the hypothalamus and pituitary, as one attribute of PCOS women is impaired P4 feedback. We will determine if progesterone receptor (PR) is regulated by androgen excess in neuroendocrine tissues and whether P4 feedback is impaired by the actions of excess androgens. We will then remove PR selectively from brain neurons, kisspeptin neurons, or pituitary gonadotropes to investigate which cells mediate P4 negative feedback and the alterations caused by androgen excess. Together, these Aims will elucidate the role of AR and PR in the neuroendocrine system in normal female reproduction and illuminate the role of excess androgens in the dysregulation of neuroendocrine control of reproduction."
"9311210","Food allergic reactions are an increasing cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and are triggered by allergen-specific IgE antibodies bound to mast cell and basophil effector cells. The molecular features that make some human IgE antibodies pathogenic have been difficult to study from polyclonal sera that contain mixtures of unknown numbers and proportions of antibody types. Similarly, the mechanisms by which IgG4 and IgG1 antibodies elicited by oral immunotherapy (OIT) can protect patients from allergic reactions would be clarified by studying defined antibodies of known sequence from patients following treatment.  We will study the functional activity of defined peanut allergen-specific human IgE, IgG4 and IgG1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) isolated from symptomatic allergic patients compared to sensitized but non-allergic controls, and from patients post-treatment who vary in their response to OIT. Cultured primary human mast cells will be used as effector cells, and will be studied with three assays extending from early cell activation (Calcium influx), through effector release, to later cytokine secretion. IgE clones will be evaluated for their allergen specificity, binding affinity, and epitope recognition, and tested in combinations to determine which species can sensitize mast cells. Blocking of mast cell activation by mAb IgG4 and IgG1 will be tested, and Fc mutations used to determine whether Fc? receptors contribute to decreases in mast cell effector functions. Finally, IgE and other antibody isotypes isolated from patient gastrointestinal tract biopsies will be compared to antibodies isolated from the blood, to determine whether there is enrichment for potentially pathogenic IgE in the mucosal sites where allergic reactions occur.  These studies are likely to have a significant impact on basic and translational human allergy research, as they will use a fully human, but well-defined experimental system to identify the molecular features of pathogenic IgE clones in the blood and GI tracts of allergic patients, and evaluate potential IgG4 and IgG1- mediated mechanisms of protection following OIT. Improved understanding of IgE clone affinities, epitope reactivities, and combinations that result in mast cell sensitization could enable better diagnostic and prognostic testing in allergic patients, while more knowledge about the criteria leading to protective IgG4 and IgG1 could guide therapeutic trials and the development of improved immunotherapy regimens."
"9236255","The microtubule-associated protein tau is now thought to contribute to disease progression and pathogenesis in Alzheimer?s disease both from within neurons and even between neurons via prion-like propagation. However, mechanisms that contribute to these pathogenic processes remain unclear. Here, we will fill these gaps in our knowledge by exploiting known anti-aggregant small chaperones that can function both inside and outside of neurons to distinctly regulate tau assembly and possibly toxicity. In fact, these small heat shock proteins are known to reside in the extracellular space and associate with both tau tangles and amyloid ß (Aß) plaques. We also know that small Hsps increase in the aging brain and even further in the Alzheimer?s brain. Our team showed that a small heat shock protein blocks tau aggregation, reduces tau levels in vivo and restores hippocampal function in a tau transgenic mouse model; but a phosphorylated variant that has impaired activity may actually promote toxicity by producing more tau oligomers. We now have evidence that the other small Hsps can also prevent tau aggregation, and even just small peptidic cores of both these small Hsps are capable of blocking tau aggregation. With these tools, we can now test the hypothesis that tau toxicity arises due to structural changes in tau assemblies brought on by small Hsps that can function both inside and outside of the neuron. To test this, we will determine the impact of distinct small Hsp variants on tau oligomer formation and uptake. We will also determine the impact of intracellular small Hsps on functional deficits in a mouse model of tau proteotoxicity. And we will determine the impact of extracellular small Hsps on functional deficits and tau uptake in mouse and human models of tau proteotoxicity. Through these studies, we anticipate that we will identify ways to regulate tau aggregation using small Hsps, which will allow us to home in on structures of toxic tau intermediates. We also will determine whether distinct small Hsp variants can differentially triage aberrant tau from inside and outside of the neuron in the brain, possibly allowing us to improve the specificity of therapeutics targeting this mechanism.  "
"9255366","Abstract  After decades of effort, global campaigns to eradicate poliovirus are nearing completion. Eradiation of wild-type PV-2 has been certified and PV1 and PV2 may be eradicated in the next few years. Many organizations and countries have collaborated in these efforts and are to be congratulated for their dedication and persistence. The oral polio vaccine (OPV) has been the workhorse of mass vaccination efforts because of its low cost and ability to stimulate robust and durable immunity. However, OPV quickly reverts to pathogenic phenotypes in the human and vaccinees secrete wild-type virus that can infect naïve bystanders. In addition, the virus can replicate chronically in immune compromised people who can shed virus for many years. For these reasons, OPV is being replaced by the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) which also stimulates durable immunity. Unfortunately, IPV costs considerably more than OPV per dose ($3-5 vs $0.12 on the subsidized world market). Because the WHO and most countries have plans to continue vaccination for at least 10 years after eradication, there will continue to be a market for the vaccine. Because of the high cost of the IPV, efforts are underway to derive improved and less expensive IPV vaccines.  In a Phase 1 SBIR, we tested the feasibility of producing a less expensive IPV using a recently developed radiation-inactivation method. A reconstituted Mn+2-decapeptide phosphate complex (MDP) from the radiation-resistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans protects antigenic sites in proteins from oxidative damage at radiation doses that obliterate DNA/RNA genomes of viral and bacterial pathogens. We hypothesized that the new method could increase the antigenicity per unit of starting virus because it avoids the extensive 12 - 28 day formalin incubation that damages the polio antigens by spontaneous protein degradation and cross-linking epitopes. Preservation of antigenicity would increase the number of doses that can be produced per milligram of purified virus and simplification of the inactivation process could reduce costs further. After optimizing the process for inactivating 100% of virus infectivity while protecting the protein capsid, we normalized the irradiated PV2 virus to the D antigen concentrations found in commercial vaccines. Rats immunized with irradiated PV2 developed robust neutralizing titers. A 1/32 fraction of the normal human dose of irradiated PV2 stimulated similar levels of neutralizing antibodies as a 1X dose of the commercial IPV product.  We propose to extend these findings to include PV1 and PV3 and then derive a trivalent vaccine having the minimum dose of each component that stimulates equivalent neutralizing antibody levels as IPV. In addition to a reduction in cost, the novel vaccine will have two additional features: the use of attenuated Sabin strains and the development of lyophilization procedures. The transition to Sabin strains will reduce the biohazard risks currently associated with producing large quantities of pathogenic strains. This feature may allow less sophisticated companies or government labs in developing countries to manufacture their own vaccines. In addition, the use of the Sabin strains may improve acceptance of the product due to the reduced risk perception associated with low levels of residual infections virus that may not be detected in quality analysis procedures. The development of a lyophilization process would improve product stability such that the vaccine would not require refrigeration during shipping and may reduce the need for refrigerated storage. In addition, a lyophilized vaccine could be stable for many years when placed in national vaccine stockpiles.  We have discussed the findings of the Phase I with several polio vaccine experts and scientists at companies that currently manufacture the vaccine. The results have been met with enthusiasm and interest for future interactions. We will keep the wider community informed of our progress during the Phase II so that we may have partnering options earlier in the development process than originally planned.  The main goal of the project is to develop an improved and less expensive inactivated polio vaccine. However, the project will also advance the irradiation technology using a highly characterized virus. The same method could be applied to the rapid and efficient preparation of vaccines against newly emerging pathogens such as Ebola, Zika, and other deadly pathogens. The regulatory pathway derived from the development of a radiation-inactivated PV vaccine would be invaluable when developing vaccines against these less characterized pathogens."
"9420717","Project Summary  Olfaction is essential for detecting volatile molecules in the environment, is crucial for the survival of many vertebrate species, and contributes significantly to quality of life in humans. In mammals, odors are detected by neurons in the main olfactory system using a large family odorant receptor (OR) genes. These genes show an unusual form of gene regulation?each olfactory neuron expresses a single allele of a single OR gene. The mechanism underlying this random monoallelic (or ?monogenic?) expression is not understood, but likely involves the interaction of proximal and distal cis-acting elements, as well as epigenetic mechanisms. Mammals also retain a smaller family of main olfactory receptors, the Trace Amine Associated Receptors (TAARs). The TAARs are also subject to monogenic expression. However, recent data have uncovered both similarities and differences between OR and TAAR gene expression?some of which raise fundamental questions about current models of OR choice. Reconciling these differences and shedding light on TAAR expression are both critical to our understanding of gene choice mechanisms in olfaction.  The goal of this proposal is to characterize for the first time genetic elements that are involved in monogenic expression of TAAR genes. I have identified two well-conserved, putative regulatory elements in the TAAR gene cluster. I propose to use advanced mouse genetic approaches to test whether and how these elements contribute to TAAR gene choice. Specific Aim 1 will use transgenesis and gene targeting via CRISPR/Cas9 to test whether one or both of these elements is sufficient to drive singular expression in specific populations of olfactory sensory neurons that normally express TAARs. Specific Aim 2 will use genome editing via CRISPR/Cas9 to determine if one or both of these elements is necessary for singular expression of TAAR genes. These experiments provide necessary first steps towards characterizing the similarities and differences between OR and TAAR gene choice mechanisms. Such comparisons will provide insight into the basic mechanisms of monoallelic gene expression and cell type diversity in the mammalian nervous system."
"9397848","?DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All genetic variation is created by mutations, changes that arise due to DNA damage or copying mistakes during DNA replication. Mutations are frequent enough that, on average, a child's 3-billion base pair genome contains 74 new genetic variants that are not present in the genome of either parent. Such new mutations confer a higher disease risk than older mutations because they have not passed the test of surviving through several generations of parents and offspring. We aim to pinpoint how the human mutation rate has evolved as humans left Africa and adapted to diverse new environments across the globe.  One specific aim will follow up on my preliminary research which showed that Europeans experienced a mutation rate change after diverging from Africans and Asians. The primary evidence for this change is that European genomes have a higher burden than African or Asian genomes of the mutation type TCC?TTC, where the trinucleotide TCC has experienced a mutation from C to T at its central site. We wish to and the genetic basis of this mutation rate change by looking at rare variants in mixed- ancestry Latino and African-American individuals. Specially, we will isolate young genetic variants that probably arose via mutation within the past 10-15 generations, after gene ow from Europe into the Americas had already begun. We will infer the genetic background (European, African, or Native American) upon which each new mutation arose and look for genomic regions where European ances- try correlates strongly with an excess of TCC?TTC mutations. These will be the regions most likely to harbor a causal allele that changed the process of mutation accumulation in Europeans. This work has the potential to yield valuable insights into melanoma, a cancer that predominantly affects individuals of European ancestry and whose somatic mutational signature is dominated by TCC?TTC.  A second specific aim is to look for other signatures of mutation rate change that have occurred within the human species or, more broadly, within the great apes. We will use a natural language processing technique called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify collections of mutation types whose rates appear to be under common genetic control. A few mutation types besides TCC?TTC show weak signals of rate differentiation between populations, and we will attempt to infer how many separate mutation rate change events are necessary to explain these signals. The admixture mapping technique from Specific Aim I can also be adapted to interrogate the genetic basis of other mutation rate changes that might have occurred in the recent past. These efforts should improve our understanding of the human mutation rate's genetic architecture and how mutation rates differ between populations."
"9203626","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The temporal regulation of replication origin initiation timing is a form of epigenetic regulation whose significance and mechanism remain poorly understood. The origin timing program is thought to be connected with the gene expression program during development, perhaps to ensure the stable inheritance of transcriptional states. Differential origin timing is also propose to play a role in genome stability. Chromatin structure has been implicated in modulating replication timing but a precise mechanism remains vague. We have now determined that Forkhead transcription factors, Fkh1 and Fkh2 (Fkh1/2), play a major role in establishing genomic replication patterns by determining the activation of many of the most efficient, early-firing origins in the yeast genome. No other factor has been identified as having such a significant impact, in level and breadth, on genomic replication patterns. The role of Fkh1/2 in origin regulation is independent of their roles in transcriptional regulation. Instead, our results show that Fkh1/2 are required for early origin clustering or subnuclear localization and their association with the initiation factor Cdc45, both in G1-phase. These results suggest the overall hypothesis that Forkhead proteins play a key role in origin regulation by tethering origins into clusters that will become the first replication factories in S-phase. We propose that origin clustering is mediated by a novel mechanism of Fkh1/2 dimerization and/or by interactions with ORC, which we recently demonstrated. These findings have opened exciting new avenues toward understanding genome organization and mechanisms of epigenetic regulation. This proposal will examine new mechanisms of function for Forkhead transcription factors in replication that will inform our understanding of their roles in transcription regulation, and our newly hypothesized role in higher-order genome organization. Our Specific Aims to determine the mechanisms that Fkh1 and Fkh2 use to regulate chromosome replication and structure are: 1) Develop molecular tools to analyze and manipulate origin clustering dynamics 2) Elucidate the role of Fkh1/2 binding in the mechanism of origin regulation 3) Perform structure-function analysis of Fkh1 and Fkh2 4) Characterize the long-range chromatin interactions mediated by Fkh1 and Fkh2"
"9429306","Project Summary  HIV-infected (HIV+) persons can survive decades on antiretroviral therapy, but this success is accompanied by a disproportionate burden of metabolic disease, including type 2 diabetes, in the HIV population. We hypothesize that the accumulation of chronically activated T cells in the adipose tissue of HIV+ persons is a central mechanism promoting local macrophage activation, impaired adipocyte function, and the development of HIV-associated glucose intolerance. This hypothesis is supported by our preliminary data showing 1.) a higher percentage of circulating memory CD4+ T cells in HIV+ persons is associated with insulin resistance and incident diabetes. 2.) Adipose tissue biopsies from HIV+ persons are enriched for activated CD8+ T cells compared to blood, and there is a strong correlation between the percentage of adipose-resident and circulating memory CD4+ T cells. 3.) In our murine model of obesity and insulin resistance, we found an association between adipose-resident CD8+ T cell density and T cell receptor oligoclonality, suggesting the expansion of CD8+ T cells in adipose tissue may represent an antigen-driven process  Prior studies of immune activation and HIV-associated metabolic disease have only measured circulating T cell subsets. In contrast, our study will recruit a longitudinal cohort of HIV+ patients on antiretroviral therapy ranging from insulin sensitive to overtly diabetic, in addition to HIV-negative diabetic controls, to identify potential mechanistic linkages between adipose-resident T cell cytokine signaling, adipose tissue inflammation, and glucose intolerance in HIV+ persons. Our three aims will determine whether circulating blood T cell subsets are reflective of adipose-resident subsets in HIV+ persons (Aim 1), whether activated adipose-resident T cells contribute to macrophage activation, adipocyte dysfunction, and glucose intolerance (Aim 2), and whether greater adipose-resident CD8+ T cell receptor oligoclonality is correlated with metabolic dysfunction (Aim 3), which may indicate the development of HIV-associated diabetes has an antigen-driven component.  This study will: 1.) clarify the role of chronic, HIV-related T cell activation in the development of glucose intolerance, 2.) assess whether the cytokine signaling profiles of adipose-resident activated, memory, and other T cell types differ from what is already known about circulating T cells, 3.) clarify the metabolic consequences of adipose tissue as a reservoir for latently HIV-infected CD4+ T cells, 4.) identify potential immunologic therapeutics targets for metabolic disease and HIV cure research, and 5.) assess whether adipose-resident CD8+ T cell oligoclonal expansion accompanies adipocyte dysfunction and glucose intolerance, and should be explored further to identify epitopes potentially contributing to HIV-associated metabolic disease. This study may also provide further insight into the role of T cells in the development of glucose intolerance in HIV-negative patients."
"9288517","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Approximately 32-35 million adults in the US population (16%) experience an episode of major depression in their lifetime, and commonly used treatments, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are not ideal since only a subset of patients (~33%) achieves remission with initial treatment. The reasons why some individuals remit to antidepressant treatments while others do not are unknown. Given that antidepressants such as SSRIs are also commonly used to treat other psychiatric disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder, it is of critical importance to determine the differences between remitters and non-remitters to antidepressant treatment. Our overall research program addresses this question by assessing antidepressant treatment resistance in mice. Preliminary data indicate that both molecular and neural-circuit based approaches to modifying the dentate gyrus may be able to convert behavioral non-responders to fluoxetine (a SSRI) into responders. Further preliminary data indicate that these approaches may also work as augmentation strategies for several other classes of antidepressants. The Specific Aims are: 1) Test the hypothesis that Activin signaling based modifications of dentate gyrus can alter the behavioral response to fluoxetine through modulation of young adult-born granule cells; 2) To test the hypothesis that circuit-based approaches to silencing mature dentate gyrus granule cells can alter the behavioral response to fluoxetine and to determine whether there are functional differences in DG inputs between responders and non-responders; and 3) Test the hypothesis that alterations in DG granule cells are a common feature of behavioral non-response to different antidepressant treatments."
"9383153","Abstract: Several important problems remain that prevent use of pig organs to save human lives, especially  for pig lungs and livers. When exposed to human blood (or transplanted into baboons), our current multi-gene  pig lungs and livers rapidly trigger disappearance of platelets and white blood cells from the circulation,  stimulate ?inappropriate? blood clotting within the blood vessels of the xenograft, and activate a vigorous  inflammatory response. The overall goal of this Project is to refine our current ?Platform Regimen? (pig genetic  changes, drug treatments) by evaluating additional rationally targeted, mechanism-based gene modifications  and pharmacologic approaches. The Specific Aims of the Project will be undertaken in ex vivo models, where  pig lungs and livers are ?perfused? with human blood, and in life-supporting in vivo baboon transplant models.   In this Project, we will evaluate whether two novel gene modifications to the pig will address the  remaining problems. One modification is expected to inhibit coagulation pathway amplification by ?tissue  factor? (Aim 1a), and the other targets platelet adhesion via the platelet's ?GP1b? receptor (Aim 2). We predict  that these genetic changes to the Platform pig will be partly successful, but may not completely solve the  problems of platelet and neutrophil adhesion and inflammation.   Planning for this outcome, we have strong evidence that specific ?adhesion molecules? are responsible  for some or all of the platelet and neutrophil adhesion phenomena that we see with our current Platform pig  genetics. We will therefore also test several carefully chosen, clinically applicable drugs, and measure their  effects on the residual pig organ injury response (Aims 1b, and 1c). These clinically applicable pharmacologic  interventions will both help us understand the remaining problems better (define the contribution of specific  pathways to liver and lung xenograft injury), and allow us to study mechanisms of organ injury that may  currently be masked by the pathways under study in this Project and in Project 1. The revised Platform  regimen will be evaluated in Aim 3, where the life-supporting capacity of pig lung and liver grafts will be  rigorously assessed, using an immunosuppressive strategy identified from Project 1. If justified by interval  findings, alternative approaches described in Project 2 or anti-inflammatory strategies (primarily under study in  Aim 1) are available, one or more of which may prove necessary to reproducibly protect pig livers and lungs  from injury in a human blood environment or in baboons.   Project 2 is thus likely to solve several of the most important known barriers to clinical use of pig lungs  and livers. Together with complementary contributions from Project 1, knowledge gained from this Program is  also likely to contribute significantly toward therapeutic clinical application of lung and other organ xenografts:  to facilitate progress into clinical trials by providing an evidence base for rationally selecting the specific  strategies to be included in treatment of the first recipients of pig organ xenografts."
"9220660","Center PI: Malenka, Robert C. Principal Investigator (Project 1): Malenka, Robert C./Südhof, Thomas  Project Summary  The ability of the mammalian brain to undergo long-lasting, activity-dependent changes in synaptic function  and structure importantly contributes to the neural circuit modifications that underlie many forms of adaptive  and pathological experience-dependent plasticity, including learning and memory. A leading model for such  synaptic plasticity is NMDA receptor-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP). Although progress has been  made in understanding the mechanisms underlying LTP, much remains unknown. This project will perform  experiments that for the first time examine the novel hypothesis that postsynaptic synaptotagmins (Syts) are  critical for the trafficking of AMPA receptors to the plasma membrane during LTP and also in the growth of  dendritic spines that accompanies LTP. Syts are known to trigger the presynaptic release of neurotransmitter  in response to calcium but their potential postsynaptic functions are largely unknown. The experiments will use  a ?molecular replacement? strategy, which incorporates the simultaneous knockdown or genetic deletion of  Syts with expression of a ?replacement? version of wildtype or mutant Syt in single hippocampal pyramidal cells  in vivo or in vitro. Electrophysiological assays in acute hippocampal slices and cell biological assays in  cultured neurons will be performed to determine the consequences of Syt manipulations on basal synaptic  responses, LTP, long-term depression and AMPA receptor exocytosis and endocytosis. The role of  postsynaptic Syts on the spine growth that accompanies LTP will also be examined. Preliminary evidence  supports a role specifically for postsynaptic Syt1 and 7 in LTP. We will focus on molecular manipulations of  these proteins for which conditional knockout mice are already available. These experiments will elucidate  novel molecular mechanisms by which excitatory synapses in the mammalian brain are likely modified during  various forms of experience-dependent plasticity, including learning and memory. The results will also open up  new, innovative areas of research on the postsynaptic membrane trafficking underlying synaptic plasticity. In  addition, this research will provide information that is critical for the development of agents that modify synaptic  transmission in ways that promote cognitive function and alleviate psychiatric symptoms.  Relevance  Learning and memory involve long-lasting modification of the communication between nerve cells at their  physical connections, which are termed synapses. This project will use sophisticated experimental techniques  to elucidate some of the key molecular mechanisms underlying how this modification happens. The information  that will be collected is essential for developing more effective treatments for the deterioration of cognitive  function that accompanies many forms of mental illness."
"9222808","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objective of the project is to understand the causes of neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease (HD). In HD polyglutamine-expanded Huntingtin (Httexp) causes early synaptic dysfunction and eventual neurodegeneration through poorly understood mechanisms. We previously discovered that Httexp binds to and sensitizes inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor 1 (InsP3R1) to InsP3. We also demonstrated that a novel inhibitor of neuronal store-operated calcium entry (nSOC) improved motor symptoms in transgenic HD flies and inhibited and neurodegeneration in YAC128 HD mouse medium spiny neurons (MSNs), the primary cell type affected in HD. Based on these results, we propose that excessive activation of InsP3R1 causes a persistent reduction in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium levels, elevated nSOC and neuronal and dendritic spine loss in HD-afflicted MSNs. To test this hypothesis, we will focus on the following aims: 1. To evaluate the causes and importance of supranormal nSOC in synaptic loss in HD MSNs To test the role of InsP3R1, we will use antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to knockdown InsP3R1 expression in YAC128 MSNs. We will also reduce levels of InsP3 by overexpressing a 5PP-RA phosphatase that metabolizes InsP3. To test the role of nSOC more directly we will use genetic strategies to knockout or knockdown STIM2, a regulator of synaptic nSOC. The effects of suppression of InsP3R1- and STIM2- mediated signaling will be evaluated in vitro and in vivo in experiments with the YAC128 HD mouse model. 2. To investigate the role of sigma 1 receptor (S1R) in HD and to evaluate S1R as a potential therapeutic target. Sigma 1 receptor (S1R) is an ER-resident protein that is activated in response to ER stress and ER calcium depletion. Activated S1R is thought to promote neuroprotection and stabilize InsP3R function, which may protect MSNs and their synaptic connections. Our preliminary data indicates upregulation of S1R in the striatum of both aged YAC128 mice and human HD patients. We will study changes in S1R- mediated signaling in the HD-afflicted striatum and investigate the potential relationship between S1R and ER Ca2+ signaling in HD MSN spines. We will also use a variety of pharmacological and molecular tools to validate S1R as a novel therapeutic target for HD. In these studies we will evaluate potential roles of dysregulated ER Ca2+ signaling, nSOC and S1R in synaptic loss in HD MSNs. We will also appraise InsP3R1, STIM2 and S1R as potential therapeutic targets for HD."
"9308428","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Rotaviruses (RVs) are highly infectious viruses of great importance because they are the most common cause of severe gastroenteritis in young children. We will address three fundamental topics in rotavirology (RV) that will expand our understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating RV innate immune evasion. 1. Determine the structural basis and in vivo activity of NSP1-mediated ?-TrCP degradation. Despite the RV NSP1 protein's well-documented ability to induce IRF3 and/or ?-TrCP degradation, the mechanisms regulating this degradation are unknown. Human RV NSP1s specifically target ?-TrCP. We have recently identified an unexpected role of the host Cullin-E3 ligase complex in NSP1's degradative functions. In this aim we will dissect how NSP1 is able to hijack the host Cullin-E3 ligase complex, induce ?- TrCP degradation, block NF-?B activation and thereby promote homologous RV replication. 2. Identify the molecular mechanisms underlying MAVS degradation by VP3 in a strain- and host- specific fashion both in vitro and in vivo. We previously showed that ssRNA byproducts from RV infection are potent activators of cytosolic sensors RIG-I and MDA5, both of which converge on mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) to relay innate signaling and induce IFN expression. Unexpected preliminary findings suggest that MAVS is targeted for proteasomal degradation by the RV VP3 protein in a host range restricted (HRR) manner. Here we will explore the complex interplay between VP3 and MAVS from different RV species at a mechanistic level and evaluate the importance of VP3-mediated MAVS degradation in promoting RV replication in vitro and in vivo. 3. Identify the mechanism of RV NSP1-mediated inhibition of STAT1 activation and the intestinal cell origin of the IFN responses to RV infection. Despite the ability to efficiently suppress the induction of type I IFN in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), homologous RV infection still induces substantial levels of type I and III IFNs in the gut. This IFN production suggests that RVs must be able to subvert IFN-mediated antiviral amplification as well as blocking IFN induction. RV NSP1 efficiently inhibits IFN-mediated STAT1 phosphorylation. New findings indicate RV blocks STAT1 activation by depleting multiple IFN receptors, likely by NSP1-directed degradation. RVs can also block IFN-directed STAT1 activation in uninfected cells in vitro. Whether this effect also occurs in vivo is unknown. We propose to identify the hematopoietic cell and IEC origins of type I and III IFNs elicited by RV infection. We will also examine the mechanistic determinants of RV-mediated IFN receptor degradation and inhibition of STAT1 activation and determine if differences in these functions contribute to RV HRR."
"9381519","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to understand why reductions in the level of the IKAP protein cause the Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathy Type III, Familial Dysautonomia (FD; also called Riley Day Syndrome). This disease is both a developmental and a progressive disorder. It is marked by tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension which results in frequent fainting and autonomic vomiting crises, pulmonary problems, renal failure and musculoskeletal manifestations including scoliosis, ataxia and weakness. This disease not only devastates the functioning of the Autonomic Nervous System, but also is marked by severe deficits in pain and temperature sensation and has CNS manifestations. FD is due to a mutation in the gene IKBKAP, in a splice acceptor site (IVS20+6T>C; 99.5% of patients) that causes the transcription of a truncated mRNA which is targeted for nonsense-mediated decay. The function of the encoded protein, IKAP, is unresolved. It clearly plays an essential role in that mice that are completely null for Ikbkap die by E10 due to failure in neurulation and vasculogenesis. To determine what role IKAP serves in the nervous system and why its absence results in FD, we have made 2 conditional-knock out mouse models for the disease in which Ikbkap is deleted either from the neural crest (using a Wnt1-cre), or from neurons in the central nervous system (CNS), but not the peripheral nervous system (PNS; using a Ta1tubulin-cre). The Wnt1-cre/Ikbkap mice die within 24 hrs of birth and analyses of their PNS demonstrates a recapitulation of the human disease with significant reductions in sympathetic, parasympathetic and TrkA+ pain and temperature sensing neurons and thus provides an excellent model for determining the developmental disruptions in the disease. We found that the reduction in PNS neurons during development is due to apoptosis of both progenitor cells and post-mitotic neurons. The Ta1tubulin-cre/Ikbkap also faithfully recapitulates classic, but distinct, hallmarks of FD including scoliosis, hind limb weakness, and gait ataxia. These mice die on average at 5 months and their condition degenerates as they age, thus they provide an excellent system in which to study the progressively degenerative mechanisms that mark FD. These results indicate not only is deletion of Ikbkap in the nervous system sufficient to cause FD, but that we have two independent models in which we can dissect the functions of IKAP in the CNS and PNS, during development vs. progression in the adult. Since the Autonomic Nervous system (ANS) is a circuit that includes both CNS and PNS components, we propose here to take a system wide approach to determine the function of IKAP in both the CNS and PNS. With an understanding of the key pathways which require IKAP, the long term goal is to develop strategies to prevent the progressive degeneration of both CNS and PNS neurons in FD and the other HSANs."
"9405792","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mental disorders comprise three of the top 10 contributors to years lived with disability globally among those  aged 15 years and over. The contribution is more pronounced in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Over 75% of those with mental disorders in LMICs receive no care despite substantial disability, and where treatment is provided, it is rarely based on evidence-based practices and human rights violations still occur frequently. In  2007,  the  Lancet  Global  Mental  Health  Series concluded that funding  should  be  given  to  research that develops and assesses interventions that can be delivered by people who are not mental health  professionals (task-shifting), and that assesses how health systems can scale up such interventions across all  routine-care settings. In the US, global health research has become one of five NIH priorities and global  mental health research is now an explicit NIMH priority. Despite recent calls for action and recognition as a  high priority, international research collaborations focused on mental disorders in LMICs is limited. Further, formal NIH postgraduate training  programs in GMH clinical  research are  not  available. In partnership with Brazil, Nigeria and countries in Central Asia, this proposed program will provide training to the next generation of GMH scientists and will have a two-fold focus. The first is deployment-focused interventions research, such that fellows will learn to develop interventions geared towards deployment in resource poor areas. With community collaboration, fellows will be trained on adaptation and field-testing of tried and true interventions that directly address recognition, assessment, prevention and treatment. The second focus is intervention dissemination, implementation and services research, with fellows learning to examine how mental health  prevention, assessment and treatment interventions can be translated for utilization in specific LMIC settings. The Global Mental Health (GMH) Research Training program will include eight components: (1) mentorship;  (2) didactic courses in clinical research design, statistics, special topics, grant writing; (3) specialized training in GMH; (4) participation  in  research,  including  design,  execution  and  analysis  of studies  and  submission  of scientific papers, reviews and proposals; (5) hands-on research experience in task-shifting and other access- enhancing  strategies  through  design  and  implementation  of  their  own  pilot  projects; (6)  instruction  in  the  responsible conduct of research; (7) presentation at scientific meetings; and (8) interchange with Columbia  faculty, our Global partners, and distinguished researchers in the field. This program will leverage existing  programs and facilities at Columbia University and international sites to provide a rich learning environment so  that fellows are steeped in a milieu focused on the scientific endeavor of promoting mental health locally and  worldwide. Because underserved populations are sadly abundant in the US, this training program will also teach young investigators the necessary skills to implement research protocols that can lead to the closing of the mental health care delivery gap in this country as well."
"9378799","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Death from opioid overdose is primarily due to respiratory depression, yet little is known about the cellular mechanisms of opioids on respiratory-controlling neurons. The long-term goal is to become an independent tenure-track investigator studying the mechanisms responsible for the respiratory depressant effects of opioids. This proposal has been designed to supplement the candidate's background in opioid pharmacology and brain slice electrophysiology and provide the additional knowledge and technical skills in respiratory physiology required to accomplish this goal. Opioids have been shown to suppress respiration through multiple areas of the central respiratory network, including the preBotzinger complex in the medulla and the Kolliker-Fuse (KF) nucleus in the pons. Although opioids have been shown to inhibit preBotzinger neurons, the mechanism of opioid actions in the KF has not been studied and is therefore unknown. The immediate goal of this proposal is to determine how opioids modulate KF neurons to alter respiration. The hypothesis is that opioids hyperpolarize KF neurons to disrupt the respiratory network. This hypothesis will be tested by recording (1) from KF neurons in brain slices and (2) from KF neurons and respiratory nerves in an in situ preparation with intact respiratory network and in vivo respiratory cycle. In Aim 1, extracellular recording from the in situ preparation will identif the respiratory phenotype of KF neurons inhibited by opioids. This new technical skill will be learned through consultation with Drs. Ana Abdala and Julian Paton (University of Bristol) and Mary Heinricher (OHSU) and will be a critical component of the candidate's career development. Given the lack of tolerance to the respiratory depressant effect of opioids, the hypothesis of Aim 2 is that there will be very little tolerance and desensitization of mu opioid receptors on KF neurons. The goal of Aim 3, which will be performed during the independent phase of this award, is to identify the location and function of 5-HT1A receptors that can reverse opioid-induced respiratory depression. A therapeutic strategy such as 5-HT1A agonists that can reverse respiratory depression, but leave analgesia intact would be a significant advance. Mentorship from John Williams, who is a world-renowned electro physiologist and has mentored over 20 scientists to achieve independent careers, will provide continued training in brain slice electrophysiology and development of skills to manage an independent research group. New knowledge in respiratory physiology will be acquired from co-mentor John Bissonnette (OHSU), who has over 30 years of experience in neural control of respiration. The new knowledge, technical skills, continued productivity and practical career guidance will place the candidate in  competitive position to become a tenure-track assistant professor studying the respiratory depressant effects of opioids from a cellular and network perspective."
"9222133","7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposal details a comprehensive four year training program to expand my clinical and translational research related to loss of gastrointestinal colonization resistance and the subsequent development of multidrug resistant (MDR) bacterial infections in the intensive care unit (ICU), as well as extensive didactic and laboratory-based training in biostatistics and microbiome analysis and methodology. The central hypothesis of this research proposal is that antibiotic resistance in the ICU is a problem of the human gastrointestinal microbiome, and that loss of gastrointestinal colonization resistance within the microbiome leads to antibiotic- resistant infections in at-risk patients. Although colonization resistance cannot be directly measured in vivo, it can be assessed through surrogate markers: loss of normal fecal biodiversity, domination by multidrug- resistant organisms (MDROs), and a rise in the total burden of antibiotic resistance genes within the gastrointestinal microbiome. The overall goal of the research is to identify the clinical and gut microbiome- related factors that contribute to loss of colonization resistance in order to facilitate strategies to prevent gut- derived MDR infections in the ICU. To accomplish this, I will perform a prospective cohort study in ICU patients with collection of samples and clinical data at the time of ICU admission and 72 hours later. Using the samples and data collected, I will then determine (1) the clinical exposures that lead to loss of gastrointestinal colonization resistance in the ICU; (2) the specific bacterial taxa that preserve gastrointestinal colonization resistance in the ICU; and (3) the impact of antibiotics on the total burden of gastrointestinal antibiotic resistance in the ICU. The results of this research will delineate the key risk factors for loss of colonization resistance, and will form the foundation for future multicenter trials for the prevention of MDR infections in the ICU and in other at-risk settings. Through the proposed complementary career development plan, I will gain additional training in advanced statistical analysis, and the laboratory-based and didactic training in the analysis of the microbiome necessary in order to develop a long-term research program to understand the relationship between the gut microbiome and MDR or other opportunistic infections. Throughout this research and these career development activities, I will be mentored by a team led by Dr. Timothy Wang, an internationally recognized scientist and expert in how gastrointestinal microorganisms can cause human disease. I am committed to a career as an independent investigator in patient oriented research and have constructed my training plan to provide the knowledge and skills needed to make substantial contributions to identifying and modifying the risk factors for gut-derived infections."
"9325840","PROJECT SUMMARY  Mosquitoes transmit zika virus as well as other pathogens that cause many deadly diseases. These vectors cause more human suffering than any other group of animals and are responsible for millions of deaths worldwide. Insecticide sprays, use of repellents and insecticide-treated bed nets for adult control and use of larvicides are the most common methods used to control disease vectors. However, widespread resistance development to insecticides in mosquitoes, human health and environmental concern from the residual toxicity of these chemicals are limiting the use of these strategies. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel strategies to control disease vectors. Many applications of RNA interference (RNAi) are being developed for use in human health. RNAi could also help with studies in vector biology as well as in developing advanced vector control methods. RNAi efficiency is variable among insects; works very well in coleopteran insects but not in insects belonging to order Diptera that includes mosquitoes. One of the main challenges in the widespread use of RNAi technology in disease vectors is the lack of efficient and reliable dsRNA delivery method. We propose to develop novel formulations of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) composited with polymers and/or particulate cores resulting in nanostructured delivery vehicles, or dsRNA nanocomposites (dsRNA-NCs). The major goal of these studies is to improve RNAi efficiency in mosquitoes that transmit Zika virus for applications in basic research as well as in the development of vector control methods. In specific Aim 1, we will prepare dsRNA-NCs and determine their properties. We hypothesize that biodegradable and environmentally friendly biomaterials could be used to develop prototype dsRNA-NCs that could aid in enhancing RNAi efficiency in mosquitoes. We will prepare cores of Ca3(PO4)2 coated with chitosan, Poly-L-Lysine or Poly- L-histidine. Additionally, Au cores will be used as an insoluble probe. A number of analytical methods will be used to determine the properties of synthesized dsRNA-NCs. We will also perform a comparative analysis of synthesized dsRNA- NCs by studying protection of dsRNA from dsRNases, its uptake, tissue distribution, intracellular transport including endosomal escape and dsRNA processing in Aeg-2 cells (a cell line developed from Aedes aegypti), Ae. aegypti larvae and adults as a model vector species. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine the efficacy and non-target effects of synthesized dsRNA-NCs in Ae. aegypti larvae and adults. We will expose Aeg-2 cells or feed Ae. aegypti larvae and adults with dsRNA- NCs and determine their efficiency in knocking down target genes and causing mortality as well as their effect on the expression of non-target genes. This application proposes to employ novel approaches, including nanotechnology to improve RNAi for use in disease vectors. The proposal uses interdisciplinary approaches to exploit modern technology for improvement in the health of citizens. Successful completion of proposed research will provide novel tools to study the biology of vectors of Zika and other pathogens and develop modern vector control methods."
"9325239","Over the past 20 years, the arcuate nucleus melanocortin system emerged as a crucial regulator of feeding and energy metabolism. A yin-yang relationship between orexigenic AgRP and anorexigenic POMC neurons has been considered a primum movens in control of whole body metabolism. Strikingly, however, we recently discovered that activation of POMC neurons by cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) is associated with increased feeding, and, that POMC neuronal activation is crucial for cannabinoid-induced feeding. Our observations suggest that the orexigenic tone of POMC neurons rely on switching vesicular release of ?-MSH to ?- endorphin. Indeed, inhibition of opiate receptors in the brain diminished cannabinoid-induced feeding. We also found that CB1R activation-induced feeding is associated whit uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2)-dependent mitochondrial dynamics in the hypothalamus, of which selective impairment by knocking down UCP2 abolished CB1R-induced feeding. These observations gave impetus to the hypothesis that cell autonomous expression of CB1R and UCP2 in POMC neurons are critical for CB1R-induced feeding and that this behavioral response relies on POMC-released ?-endorphin. We also predict that POMC-driven feeding occurs in physiological circumstances. For example, elevated endogenous cannabinoid levels coincide with activation of POMC neurons after feeding initiation subsequent to a prolonged fast as well as in diet-induced obese mice. We hypothesize that an orexigenic POMC tone, utilizing the mechanisms described above, is an important element in rebound feeding after food deprivation and in high fat diet-induced obesity.  We will test our hypotheses by utilization of unique transgenic mice lines in combination with state-of- the art neurobiological, cellular biological, biochemical and physiological approaches. With the execution of these studies, we will deliver an entirely novel aspect of feeding regulation by the POMC system with immediate implications to physiology and disease states of metabolism."
"9307089","Project Abstract: Babesiosis is a zoonosis and an important blood-borne human parasitic infection. This disease has recently gained much attention because of its growing infection rate in humans by transfer from animal reservoirs; because it represents a potential threat to the blood supply; because asymptomatic infections in man are common and these can be life threatening in certain recipients. Despite the impending danger of the spread of this blood-borne infection, and the significant threat that it presents to the safety of blood transfusions, its study has been neglected. There are 4 major sub-populations of asexual parasites defined by their DNA loads (1 N; 2 N; 4N and ?4N iRBC populations). B. divergens appears to regulate the time spent in the host RBC by building an appropriate mix of subpopulations of iRBCs that provides a high flexibility in terms of developmental options based on the proliferative needs of the population. It has become increasingly clear that most cells communicate within their immediate environment by the formation and release of extracellular vesicles (ECVs). Extracellular vesicles derived from ``donor parasitized cells'' can have profound effects on ``recipient cells'' by altering gene expression and modulating signaling pathways resulting in developmental changes. We have identified extracellular vesicles (ECVs) that are released from babesia iRBCs and hypothesize that these ECVs are the mode of communication between infected RCS, leading to the choice of a specific developmental pathway. We will explore this hypothesis by (1) characterizing the repertoire of ECVs released by B. divergens under various physiological conditions and (2) establish whether specific populations of ECVs function in cell-cell communication. By focusing on those intended for extracellular trafficking, we may identify means of intercellular communication that will be analyzed in future studies. Success is predicted by our experience with Babesia biology, robust preliminary data, cutting edge technology and having all necessary reagents in place to perform the studies. This R21 grant will provide an important dataset to the parasite community and provide further evidence of the role of ECVs in parasite pathogenesis."
"9230220","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neuro-inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that causes demyelination and axonal damage. Current therapies available to MS patients are sub-optimal, and there is no cure for this chronic, debilitating disease. B cell depletion therapies have shown promise in several treatment trials, yet B cells can also play protective and anti-inflammatory roles that are important during health and disease. Determining the mechanisms by which B cell antigen presentation mediates neuroinflammation and tolerance in MS is crucial for developing immunomodulatory therapies targeted to encephalitogenic B cell functions. Using an in vivo conditional MHCII expression system and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), our lab has demonstrated that B cells are not sufficient antigen presenting cells (APCs) for passive EAE induced by adoptive transfer of encephalitogenic CD4 T cells unless enough B cells recognize the cognate antigen, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). Further experiments have supported our hypothesis that MOG-specific, membrane bound B cell receptor, rather than MOG-specific secreted immunoglobulin, is critical to the propagation of CD4 T cell auto-reactivity, likely for efficient capture of target antigen. These findings highlight the importance of soluble antibody independent B cell functions to MS pathogenesis. In Aim 1 I will determine restrictions on the location of B cell antigen presentation by quantifying B cell localization and MHCII expression in the CNS compartment. I will also assay murine cerebrospinal fluid for the presence of intrathecal immunoglobulin indicative of B:T cell cognate interactions within the CNS. Lastly, the capacities of non-specific and antigen-specific B cells from passive EAE mice to traverse an in vitro blood brain barrier model will be tested. In Aim 2 I will define the effect of antigen-specifc B cells on CD4 T cell lineage fate during EAE. T cell cytokine production will be determined in antigen recall assays using naïve and in vitro- primed splenocytes from WT mice and mice with conditional expression in various APC subsets. Additionally, I will define the cytokine expression profile of B cells from different B-cell dependent EAE models and quantify B cell expression of IL-1?. The hypothesis that B cells shape T cell lineage plasticity will be tested by modulating th timing of B cell antigen presentation in passive EAE in conjunction with dendritic cell MHCII expression. Successful completion of the research proposed in these aims will increase our understanding of cellular mechanisms of inflammatory demyelinating diseases of the CNS. We will identify where important pathogenic functions of B cells occur in EAE and distinguish mechanisms of pathogenic cytokine generation as potential targets for immunotherapy in MS."
"9214314","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K24 proposal builds upon a decade of clinical and epidemiologic research in Zambia, where the candidate - Benjamin Chi, MD, MSc - has lived since 2003. The application is timed to correspond with an important midcareer transition, as Dr. Chi returns to the U.S. in July 2015 to coordinate his ongoing global research and training activities from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC). Dr. Chi's career to date has focused on clinical research and effectiveness studies. Through this K24 award, he seeks formal training in the burgeoning field of implementation research. This work will greatly augment his current portfolio in patient- oriented research, allowing him to further explore facilitators and barriers to the successful implementation of proven interventions. He has recruited a multidisciplinary faculty to collaborate and support him in this endeavor, one that reflects the breadth and depth of UNC's resources in implementation research. Candidate: Dr. Chi is a recognized thought leader in the prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT). He has led high-impact clinical trials and effectiveness studies, and seeks to complement these skills by developing capacity in implementation research. Despite growing investment from NIH and others, there is currently a paucity of such expertise in the field of PMTCT. The rigorous methods developed in domestic implementation research have not yet translated widely in international work, a gap this application aims to address. Mentoring Plan/Environment: Dr. Chi has an established track record in research training, including leadership of two NIH-funded fellowship programs. Because of competing administrative responsibilities, however, his available time for mentorship has become limited in recent years. With K24 support, he will rededicate his efforts in the mentoring of advanced trainees (e.g., postdoctoral fellows, junior faculty) as they look to become independently funded investigators. He will leverage UNC's extensive resources to accomplish this goal, including NIH-funded centers and training programs, networks and collaborations, and global health institutes and departments. Research Plan: Dr. Chi proposes to study the implementation of new point-of-care (POC) technologies for early infant diagnosis of HIV (EID). POC assays hold great promise, but many factors regarding their implementation - including their integration into existing services - are yet unknown. Built upon the framework of a soon-to-begin randomized NIH-funded study, Dr. Chi will identify barriers to EID uptake and measure the fidelity of diagnostic service implementation (i.e., the extent to which the intervention is delivered as designed), comparing POC-based services to the current standard of HIV DNA PCR testing. Using data obtained from this trial, he will model the population impact of POC EID and other, related interventions to determine optimal strategies for rolling-out EID services across different settings. This plan offers a framework for Dr. Chi's training in implementation research while also providing a platform for mentoring future investigators committed to patient-oriented research."
"9254639","Licit and illicit drug use places a large burden on the nation's health care systems and the economy, costing more than $500 billion annually. Addiction is a chronic brain disease that leads to a compulsive desire for drugs despite significantly harmful consequences, including direct effects on health as well as detriments to society, including disintegration of families, child abuse, loss of employment, and a broad array of crimes. Reprogramming of human somatic cells to alter cellular identity has enormous potential for neurological disease modeling, high-throughput drug screening, cell therapy, and personalized medicine. However, several challenges remain before patient-specific cells produced by reprogramming can provide reliable insights into neurological disease mechanisms (e.g., Drug abuse/ addiction, other neurological disorders) or be efficiently applied to drug discovery and transplantation therapy. Using our innovative patented technology to develop Artificial 3D Microenvironment Niche and screen for reprogramming small molecules (US Patent # 9045737), we have developed a preliminary small molecule cocktail that efficiently (up to 50% of starting cell numbers, mostly Glutamatergic Neurons) and directly converts human fibroblasts into neurons, bypassing the neural progenitor stage (Chemically induced Neurons, hCiN). In this Phase I proposal, we attempt to demonstrate the feasibility of this methodology by optimizing our preliminary hCiN cocktails while investigating hCiN functionally with molecular, cellular, electrophysiological assays and in a mouse brain transplantation model."
"9314784","Project Summary/Abstract 1  This proposal details a 5-yr plan to prepare the candidate, Juan C. Cardet MD, for a career as an 2  independent, translational investigator positioned to impact our understanding of asthma. The aim is to clarify 3  the relationship between enterolactone and asthma through complementary clinical and basic strategies.  4  Lignans are dietary, plant-derived chemicals with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Enterolactone  5  is the end product of human gut bacterial metabolism of lignans. Differences in gut microbiome composition  6  categorize patients into high- vs. low-enterolactone producers. This group reported concentration-dependent  7  inverse associations between enterolactone and asthma in a nationally-representative cohort (NHANES); but  8  this study is limited by its cross-sectional design and incomplete clinical characterization. We hypothesize  9  that enterolactone's inverse relationship with asthma is driven by its anti-inflammatory and anti- 10  oxidative properties. The candidate will clarify whether enterolactone has a clinically-evident relationship 11  with asthma by analyzing data from the NHLBI Severe Asthma Research Program's (SARP) prospective 12  study. As a founding partnership in SARP, our group has access to stored biospecimens and participants' 13  clinical, biochemical, and physiological data collected during 3 years of follow-up. Further, the candidate 14  will employ in vitro and in vivo approaches to determine enterolactone's effects on human airway structural 15  cells and murine models of asthma. Preliminary data by Cardet et al suggest that enterolactone may have 16  anti-inflammatory effects on A549 human airway epithelial cells, observations this group will extend through 17  this proposal. Clinical findings will steer the focus of laboratory experiments, and reversely, discoveries at the 18  bench will generate clinical questions. At this project's conclusion, the candidate will be skillful with (1) 19  sophisticated biostatistical analyses on clinical datasets such as SARP's; and with designing, conducting, and 20  interpreting experiments on (2) airway structural cells (3) and murine models of asthma. 21  During the award period, the candidate will leverage his clinical experience with asthma, regular exposure to 22  NIH research networks, and structured academics at the HSPH's MPH program. This training will allow him to 23  transition to independence during the 4-5th years of the award. Dr. Cardet will work under the 1° mentorship of 24  Dr. Elliot Israel, an expert in translation asthma research with an excellent mentoring record. He will have as 25  co-mentors Drs. Quan Lu and Stephanie Shore, who will train Dr. Cardet to master the basic experiments 26  described herein (see `Research Strategy, Aim 2'). Further, Dr. Cardet has assembled a team of 27  extraordinary physician-scientists (Drs. Joshua Boyce, Bruce Levy, and Wanda Phipatanakul), who have 28  committed their time and expertise to assist his career development and research goals. Their mentorship, the 29  scientific-clinical environment at BWH and HSPH, and the proposed research goals and career development 30  plan will position the candidate to establish himself as an independent translational asthma researcher."
"9412733","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) involves the inappropriate activation of the adaptive immune system against self-antigens. The adaptive immune system includes B and T lymphocytes. B cells contribute to SLE by the improper production of self-reactive antibodies and induction of effector T cells. A subset of T cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), contribute to SLE by loss of their suppressive function of effector T cells. An intriguing feature of SLE is that it is far more common in females than males, with a ratio of 9:1, strongly suggesting a genetic link with X chromosome diploidy. My preliminary studies show a significant frequency of chromosome X co-localization or coalescence in human female Tregs as compared to a non-lymphocyte control. In the control the active X (Xa) and inactive X (Xi) chromosome are kept separate from one another at a higher frequency suggesting a protective mechanism not seen in Tregs. I hypothesize that the coalescence of the Xa and Xi chromosome leads to trans-chromosomal gene regulation resulting in inappropriate repression of lymphocyte-specific genes located on the Xa leading to cellular dysfunction and autoimmunity in women. The first aim of my proposal will identify the human female lymphocyte populations most susceptible to chromosome X coalescence as well as the regulatory effects of the Xa and Xi being in close proximity. The nuclear organization traits, epigenetic modifications, and expression levels of genes important for lymphocyte function that are located on chromosome X will be measured during chromosome coalescence and separation. Measurements and analysis will be carried out by various three-dimensional fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques including; RNA/DNA FISH, immuno-DNA FISH, and intron chromosomal expression (ice)/DNA FISH. The second aim will focus on identifying direct links between chromosome X coalescence and altered expression levels of lymphocyte specific genes in SLE patient lymphocytes. The primary focus will be on chromosome X coalescence in Tregs and its effect on FOXP3 expression. FOXP3 is required for Treg differentiation and Treg suppressive function. Lowered levels of FOXP3+ Tregs is an established hallmark of SLE. RNA/DNA FISH, immuno-DNA FISH, and intron chromosomal expression (ice)/DNA FISH will be utilized for this aim in order to analyze nuclear organization traits, epigenetic modifications,  and gene expression levels on a per cell basis in SLE lymphocytes. In summary, this proposal aims to address a long-standing question in the study of SLE with a novel nuclear organization oriented approach. The successful completion of the aims outlined above would identify for the first time the genetic cause and mechanism underlying the increased incidence of SLE in women. Also, the successful completion of this analysis would yield a novel marker for SLE diagnosis. Such an advance is very much needed as current criteria for diagnosis are non-specific and often leads to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment. Additionally, this would be the first documented instance of chromosome X trans-chromosomal regulation in differentiated cell types."
"9346339","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Zika virus (ZIKV), an emerging arbovirus transmitted by the Aedes mosquitoes, has been correlated with newborn microcephaly and Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults. The World Health Organization has declared Zika a public health emergency and is calling for new diagnostics and enhanced surveillance. In particular, point-of-care (POC) diagnostics that enable rapid sharing of clinical and epidemiological data will facilitate international control and research efforts. Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of patient blood is the current standard for ZIKV diagnosis. Unfortunately, RT-PCR requires technical expertise, complex instruments, and infrastructure typically only available in clinical laboratories. Accurate, inexpensive diagnostic tools for patient care and epidemiological surveillance of insect vectors in remote or resource-limited areas are sorely lacking. To fill this critical need, we propose to develop a POC nucleic acid diagnostic that will identify ZIKV directly from mosquito vectors and from patient saliva that can not only be non-invasively sampled but is more frequently positive for ZIKV compared to blood.  Paratus Diagnostics has previously design, developed and demonstrated a point-of-care system (the PreparedNOW® system) that can meet the demanding challenges outlined above. As described in further detail below, the Paratus Diagnostics POC device has previously been shown to be capable of detecting ZIKV genes using a highly advanced and innovative molecular multiplexed assay developed by our partner, Prof. Andy Ellington of the University of Texas. Two variants of the basic Paratus PreparedNOW® system have been demonstrated: one version is capable of processing actual mosquitos; the second version will accept human patient saliva as the specimen from which to perform a diagnostic test to determine if an individual has been infected with Zika. Our proposed system under this project will be capable of detecting biologically relevant concentrations of viral RNA in human saliva or infected mosquitoes within 60 minutes (Aim 2, Objective 4). Our platform leverages our patented and well-tested portfolio of devices; and several components have been reduced to practice and successfully tested. Our approach relies on a consumable cartridge for sample collection, preparation and molecular assay processing all within a housing that fits in the palm of a hand, and requires only a few intuitive user-operated steps. Development of this simple-but-robust approach to fast and accurate pathogen detection can be readily diversified to a wide array of pathogens and vectors.  Our point-of-care diagnostic solution will be powered by the unique one-pot assay being developed by our partner Dr. Andrew Ellington (University of Texas, Austin). This assay incorporates several innovations. First, the unique amplification assay (RT-LAMPdeg) will be adapted for co-amplifying four ZIKV genes in a single assay (Aim 1, Objective 1). Second, false positives will be nearly eliminated by coupling the amplification assay with a unique nucleic acid probe (4GO) that will sequence-specifically transduce up to four ZIKV genes into single-channel fluorescence readable by the Paratus system (Aim 1, Objective 2). This will allow a single assay to accurately detect known ZIKV variants, fully accounting for most currently circulating Asian and African lineages. Third, fluorescence will be readout using our smartphone based system, and the assay will be proofed with clinical and biological samples (obtained from Dr. Grant Hughes, University of Texas Medical Branch) (Aim 2, Objective 3)."
"9303656","The mediodorsal (MD) and adjacent reuniens (Re) and intralaminar (IL) nuclei are prominent components of central thalamus that are organized to provide rapid and precise modulatory control of distributed neural networks involving medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) that support adaptive goal-directed behavior. The essential role of these nuclei in cognition and awareness has been established by clinical and preclinical studies of neurological and psychiatric disorders that affect them. There is surprisingly little known about the activity of neurons in these nuclei and how they influence the networks they innervate during goal- directed behavior. We propose to address this gap in our knowledge by studying neuronal activity in rats performing dynamic delayed nonmatching to position (dDNMTP): a task that incorporates critical features of goal-directed behavior affected by mPFC, hippocampal, and central thalamic lesions. Preliminary studies were conducted to compare coding properties of neurons in MD and mPFC and to examine the effects of inactivating central thalamus on mPFC activity during dDNMTP. We propose to advance this work by conducting three new lines of investigation. The first will examine neuronal activity during task manipulations of dDNMTP designed to characterize differences in coding properties of neurons in MD, rostral and caudal IL, and Re. We want to learn how information is represented about actions, outcomes, and contextual factors that underlie behavioral choice. Our goal is to elucidate neuronal activity that underlies functions supported by individual nuclei in awake, behaving animals. The second aim will use optogenetic methods to examine the effects of temporarily disrupting MD. MD will be disrupted unilaterally to preserve behavioral function and to allow contralateral mPFC to serve as a control for nonspecific effects of the treatment. We want to learn how MD contributes to the disruptive effects of central thalamic inactivation on neuronal coding in mPFC observed in preliminary studies and behavioral performance observed in earlier reports. Our goal is to understand how momentary changes in MD activity affect mPFC function. The third aim will examine effects of unilateral MD lesions. We will lesion MD before dDNMTP training begins to deprive ipsilesion mPFC of MD input during learning. One control group will receive lesions after training (before recording begins) and another control group will receive sham surgery. We want to ascertain how MD affects neuronal responses in mPFC during learning and how chronic lesions affect the expression of mPFC responses for tasks learned before lesions are made. Our goal is to test the hypotheses that MD plays critical roles shaping responses of mPFC neurons during learning and optimizing information processing in mPFC once behaviors are learned.  Beyond its scientific contributions this proposal will enrich opportunities for undergraduate and graduate neuroscience research at UNH providing research opportunities and funds to support students who might otherwise be unable to afford to commit the time required to participate fully in our research program."
"9239945","Project Summary The coronary vasculature plays essential roles in maintaining a continuous supply of oxygen and nutrients to the heart. Coronary heart disease is a major cause of myocardial infarction and heart failure, which continues to be the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Despite its importance, the mechanisms that regulate coronary vascularization of the myocardium remain a major gap in our knowledge. We observed that during zebrafish heart development, coronary vessels form a close association with a specific subpopulation of cortical cardiomyocytes marked by the transcription factor Gata4. gata4+ cardiomyocytes follow the tracks of coronary endothelial cells when they emerge onto the surface of the juvenile zebrafish hearts. Furthermore, our preliminary data suggest that expression of the Cxcl12b chemokine, a critical angiogenic factor during zebrafish coronary vessel development, is increased in expanding gata4+ cardiomyocytes. Moreover, gata4+ cardiomyocytes fail to associate with coronary vessels in hearts lacking Cxcr4a, the receptor for Cxcl12b. Importantly, adult cxcr4a mutant zebrafish fail to regenerate after heart injury. We hypothesize that heart development occurs in two phases that are regulated by temporally distinct mechanisms: newly formed coronary endothelial cells provide instructive cues, such as paracrine factors, during the emerging phase to guide gata4+ cardiomyocytes when they emerge, while during the expanding phase, cxcl12b expression increases in gata4+ cardiomyocytes to attract coronary vessels that are essential for their morphogenesis/development and regeneration. We propose to 1) To determine how new coronary vessels guide gata4+ cardiomyocytes to populate the heart ventricle by analyzing differentially expressed candidate genes identified from RNAseq encoding secreted molecules (e.g. cxcr4, erbb4) using CRISPR mutant fish lines and a novel explant culture system; 2) To determine how coronary vessels affect morphogenesis and the regenerative capacity of gata4+ cardiomyocytes during myocardial expansion using multicolor clonal analysis and by manipulating Cxcl12-Cxcr4 chemokine signaling. We will further determine how cxcl12b expression is regulated by hypoxia and Gata4. Our proposed study will reveal potential developmental causes of coronary heart diseases. Furthermore, elucidation of the mechanisms underlying myocardial vascularization in zebrafish will shed light on potential therapeutic approaches for humans."
"9217829","ABSTRACT The purpose of the proposed study is to investigate the separate effects of corneal stiffness and intraocular pressure (IOP) on corneal deformation characteristics under an applied air pulse. Paired human donor eyes (n=60 pairs; 120 eyes) will be used to allow both IOP and corneal stiffness to be varied in a systematic fashion with one eye of the pair treated with a corneal stiffening procedure, and the fellow eye serving as control, combined with 4 levels of IOP from 10 to 40 mmHg in 10mmHg increments. Stiffness will be modified using incremental changes in gluteraldehyde concentration to generate two stiffness groups. Deformation characteristics will be measured in a series of 140 images captured during a ~30ms air pulse with the CorVis ST, a new device with a high speed speed camera (>4,300 frames/sec) aligned with the horizontal meridian of the cornea using Scheimpflug geometry. ANOVA will be used to determine differences in the 3x4 matrix of data, as well as stepwise regression to determine predictors of IOP and level of stiffness based on deformation parameters including a novel stiffness parameter. A clinical investigation of deformation response in keratoconus (n=50), glaucoma (n=50), ocular hypertension (n=50), diabetes (n=50), and normal individuals (n=200) will be conducted with evaluation of novel stiffness parameter. Expected results include the creation of a comprehensive database of ex vivo and in vivo corneal deformation response parameters as a function of IOP, corneal stiffness parameter, and in vivo ocular disease."
"9271349","Project summary/abstract Given the observed increased risk of HIV due to policing behaviors, a police education program (PEP) is being conducted in Tijuana, Mexico to protect police officers from occupational needlestick injuries while simultaneously harmonizing law enforcement and public health priorities. The long-term sustainability of this intervention is dependent upon whether it is cost-effective in terms of reducing HIV incidence. Indeed, structural interventions such as police education interventions may hold promise as novel strategies to reduce HIV transmission among people who inject drugs in many locations around the world where policing behavior contribute to HIV transmission. To evaluate the potential of PEPs on reducing HIV incidence, this mentored research scientist development award will focus on building dynamic cost-effectiveness and mathematical models to examine the impact of the PEP on the PWID population in Tijuana. The first aim is to model the cost-effectiveness of the police education program, including both individual and population prevention benefits on the HIV epidemic among PWID in Tijuana; the second aim is to model the potential impact of increased police referrals to harm reduction services (SEP and OST) on HIV incidence among PWID; and the third aim is to explore how increased police referral of PWID to SEP and OST services could improve the overall cost- effectiveness of the police education program. The candidate, Dr. Javier Cepeda, is well-qualified to conduct this research because of his strong background in quantitative methods and track record of producing high impact work. Over the 5 year award period, Dr. Cepeda will achieve the following career development objectives: 1) Acquire expertise in the principles of health economic evaluation and cost-effectiveness analysis with an emphasis on HIV preventative interventions 2) Develop skills in mathematical modeling of infectious disease transmission with a focus on HIV epidemics among people who inject drugs 3) Acquire training in the design and implementation of theory-driven structural interventions focusing on HIV prevention in resource- limited settings 4) Obtain expertise in the ethical conduct of research pertaining to structural HIV prevention interventions among vulnerable populations in resource limited settings 5) Expand professional development skills in preparation for a successful academic career by developing grantsmanship, publishing manuscripts, and future scientific collaborations To accomplish these training aims, he has assembled an outstanding team of mentors with expertise in HIV, substance abuse, epidemiology, mathematical modeling, cost-effectiveness and design of HIV prevention interventions. Under their supervision, he will complete coursework and attend workshops, scientific meetings, and conduct research to apply the skills to become an independent researcher in HIV, substance abuse, mathematical modeling leading to independence. These training and research aims are inline with the Office of AIDS Research high priority topics: ?Reducing Incidence of HIV/AIDS? and ?Research Training of the workforce required to conduct High Priority HIV/AIDS or HIV/AIDS-related research?."
"9246676","The autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a heterogeneous group of developmental disorders with specific core features, including impaired social interaction and abnormal repetitive behavior. Several ongoing studies, including our own, are assessing the use of the drug oxytocin to ameliorate social deficits in individuals with ASDs and other psychosocial disorders. We hypothesize that behavioral response to oxytocin treatment is mediated by genetic and epigenetic factors and that these factors, particularly epigenetic mediators of gene expression, may be pivotal to baseline response and/or may change during oxytocin exposure. This proposal will explore the role of the epigenome and genetic predisposition to oxytocin treatment response in longitudinal samples that have already been collected as part of an ongoing clinical trial in high and low functioning children with ASDs; we will investigate the transcriptome and epigenome (5mC and 5hmC) in regions of the brain and periphery of a mouse model of ASD known to have positive response to oxytocin treatment; we will also examine novel regulatory mechanisms of oxytocin's receptor OXTR via 5-hydroxy methyl cytosine. The data generated by these aims will not only serve to develop (epi)genetic predictors of oxytocin response, but they will inform other trials using oxytocin to treat psychosocial disorders.   "
"9257138","PROJECT SUMMARY Notch signaling is critical for early T-cell development. At its core, Notch signaling relies on the interaction between Notch-family receptors with their cognate, transmembrane-bound Delta-like family ligands. Upon ligand recognition and binding, Notch receptors undergo a series of proteolytic cleavage events, allowing the release and translocation of Notch intracellular domain (NotchICD) into the cell nucleus. Within the nucleus, NotchICD can interact with its DNA-binding partner, Recombination Signal Binding Protein-Jk (RBPJk) to activate expression of target genes. Despite the essential role for Notch-mediated gene regulation in this developmental context, it remains a mystery how NotchICD can localize to DNA and differentially regulate gene expression, given its near-uniform expression pattern. One important negative regulator of Notch signaling is Spen. Spen has been shown to compete with NotchICD for RBPJk binding and can recruit co-repressive complexes to remodel chromatin and repress genomic loci. Recently, Spen was shown to directly interact with a group of nucleic acid molecules called long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). Given their preferential localization within the cell nucleus, ability to coordinate nuclear organization through protein-scaffolding, and documented tissue and temporal specificity greater than mRNA or protein, lncRNAs are an attractive and as of yet- uncharacterized class of regulatory molecules that could mediate differential expression of Notch-target genes. We hypothesize that lncRNAs recruit Spen to distinct RBPJk bound sites on DNA. This in turn, biases NotchICD towards sites of `un-occupied' RBPJk, leading to activation of target genes. Changes in lncRNA expression would modulate Spen localization and alter NotchICD's accessible genomic repertoire in a stage- and temporally-specific manner. We will this hypothesis by characterizing the dynamics of NotchICD and Spen genomic localization using Chromatin-ImmunoPrecipitation, determining if Spen's interactions with RNA are critical for regulation of Notch signaling using Spen truncation analysis, and characterizing the roles of specific lncRNA-Spen interactions on differential expression of Notch target genes using genetic perturbation, in ex vivo differentiated pro-T cell subsets. The results of this study have the potential to incorporate lncRNAs into our understanding of dynamic gene regulation during development and differentiation, generalizable to signaling pathways in other biologic contexts. Moreover, dysregulation of the Notch signaling pathway has been linked to a variety of hematologic and solid malignancies, including T-Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia and Pancreatic cancer. By identifying and characterizing novel lncRNA-Spen interactions in this study, we hope to identify new, increasingly specific targets for pharmacologic manipulation of the Notch signaling pathway towards the treatment of human disease."
"9415876","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although the Human Genome was sequenced to 99.7% completion in 2003, it has become clear that the sequence of DNA alone is not sufficient to explain human health and disease in its entirety. This has led to a new appreciation of the factors outside the DNA sequence itself that regulate cellular processes and outcomes. In eukaryotic cells, the DNA is packaged into arrays of nucleosomes, each of which contains ~146 base pairs of DNA wrapped around an octamer of the core histone proteins. For almost half a century, nucleosomes were thought to be nothing more than building blocks, serving only to package and organize eukaryotic DNA within the nucleus. It is now apparent that histone proteins as well as the associated regulatory machinery are required for all nuclear processes. Chromatin dynamics play a central role in regulating gene expression and are necessary to maintain normal cellular function. Dysregulation of epigenetic signals has been associated with numerous human malignancies. Chromatin-regulating factors are some of the most frequently affected proteins in cancer, and these proteins have emerged as promising therapeutic targets. Many epigenetic regulatory mechanisms, including acetylation of lysine 56 in histone H3 (H3K56Ac), are conserved in eukaryotes. H3K56Ac plays a critical role in replication-dependent histone deposition, nucleosome turnover, DNA repair and in promoting pluripotency of human embryonic stem cells. Alternations in H3K56Ac levels have negative consequences on transcription and genome stability, and elevated levels of H3K56Ac have been measured in several human cancers. Together, the results indicate a regulated balance between acetylation and deacetylation of H3K56 is required for normal cellular function. Recent work suggests H3K56Ac levels are important for regulating noncoding transcription and chromosomal folding in yeast. However, it is unclear whether the effects are replication-dependent or -independent, making it difficult to fully understand the mechanism. The goals of this research are to investigate the role of replication-independent H3K56 acetylation in regulating transcription and chromosomal folding as well as to determine whether aberrant transcription caused by hyperacetylation ultimately leads to DNA damage. State-of-the-art genome-wide analyses of the transcriptome and genome architecture, including native-elongating transcript sequencing and a recently developed chromatin capture technique, termed Micro-C, will be utilized to monitor transcription and chromatin folding at single nucleotide and nucleosome level resolution, respectively. By using novel genome-spanning methods to answer complex biological questions, the results will provide important molecular insight into the cellular functions of H3K56 acetylation as well as the consequences of hyperacetylation, which may have important implications in understanding human malignancies. Furthermore, the results will greatly enhance our knowledge of the interplay between histone PTMs, chromatin remodeling, and chromatin structure as well as their roles in the mechanisms governing transcriptional control."
"9209255","Obesity is a major concern for our society, and development of strategies to help decrease body weight is important in the battle against obesity and comorbid health conditions. As the major endogenous mechanism responsible for combating obesity, understanding how proopiomelanocortin (POMC) mediates feeding and reward learning, and how this may change following obesity is essential for rational development of therapeutics to treat obesity. Neurons containing POMC are found in the arcuate nucleus and project to many areas such as the nucleus accumbens and hypothalamus. Beta-endorphin (b-END) and alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (a-MSH) are neuropeptide products of POMC, and have well-established central roles in reward (food, drugs of abuse, sex) and learning. Despite their hypothesized co-release from terminals, studies to date have overwhelmingly looked at the role of either b-END or a-MSH alone in feeding and reward, and results from these studies have suggested opposing roles for these peptides in feeding which is perplexing. The overall objective for this application is to 1) determine sensitivity of nucleus accumbens projecting POMC neurons to leptin and insulin (known simulators of POMC neuron firing), and 2) establish the physiological and behavioral role of co- released b-END and a-MSH in the nucleus accumbens in feeding and reward learning. These two objectives will be assessed in energy neutral state and following diet induced obesity to assess if adaptations to the system occur following obesity. The central hypothesis is that POMC signaling in the nucleus accumbens is important in the regulation of feeding and learning about food reward, and that this role for POMC is impaired following development of obesity. These studies will, for the first time, delineate the behavioral role of POMC signaling from the arcuate nucleus to the nucleus accumbens on reward learning and feeding both in normal energy state and after the development of obesity."
"9238854","Project Summary: NF-?B signaling pathway is one of the most extensively studied and understood pathways, however, the physiological impact of augmented NF-?B signaling in hematopoiesis has not been understood. Despite many recent studies documenting constitutive activation of NF-?B in patients with hematological disorders, including AML and MDS, it is remains unclear if constitutive NF-?B signaling is sufficient and/or necessary for the onset of the disease. Recently, we have shown that lack of A20 (a negative regulator of NF-?B) in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) causes loss of quiescence and severe hematologic abnormalities, due to constitutive NF-?B activation. In an attempt to decipher the role of NF-?B in HSCs, directly , we engineered mice to constitutively activate NF-?B in HSCs. Our preliminary data indicate that HSC quiescence and pool were completely lost, and that increased NF-?B signal alone was sufficient to disturb the transcriptional regulatory circuits of HSCs. In the proposed research, we would like to decode the potential molecular mechanisms through which increased NF-?B signals affect HSC biology. Our hypothesis is that deregulated canonical NF-?B signals impair hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) quiescence and functions by altering signal transduction pathways, `transcription factor networks' and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. To test this hypothesis, we will use a combination of genetic, molecular cell biology and biochemical approaches. In specific aim 1, we will decipher the intrinsic mechanisms through which NF-?B affects HSC functions. In specific aim 2, we will unravel the extrinsic role of NF-?B in the control of HSCs. In specific aim 3, we would generate a novel humanized mouse model and decode the involvement of NF-?B signals in human HSC biology.  We believe that the proposed research will provide key insights into the pathologic processes involving deregulated NF-?B signals, and will aid the development of newer and more successful therapies for human hematologic diseases that arise due to constitutive NF-?B activation.  "
"9247780","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To address the inherent trade-offs between the size, resolution, and field of view (FOV) of thin clinical endoscopes, we propose a novel ptychographic endoscope based on the Fourier ptychography (FP) technology. Ptychographic endoscope uses angularly varying illumination to extend the performance beyond the limit defined by the optical system. It has the following key features: (1) the achievable resolution of ptychographic endoscopy system is determined by the largest incident angle, not the numerical aperture (NA) of the employed miniaturized optics; (2) it is possible to recover the high resolution sample image and correct for remaining aberrations of the employed optics, enabling a much larger design space; (3) the recovered high-resolution images at different depths can be used to construct a 3D image of the tissue topographic structure; and (4) with continuous illumination, the instrument works as a conventional low resolution endoscope. When high resolution imaging is needed, it works in FP mode with sequential pulse illuminations. The goal of this proposal is to develop thin endoscope and image reconstruction algorithms to demonstrate the ptychographic endoscopy system, by pursuing the following aims: (1) develop the ptychographic endoscopy system using miniaturized optics and illumination fibers (Month 1-14); (2) develop a high speed image construction platform to construct a high-resolution image over large FOV and large depth of field in real time (Month 1-15); and (3) characterize and evaluate the imaging performance of the ptychographic endoscopy system (Month 14-24). Ptychographic endoscope is compact and doesn't require a complicated system, it is also low cost because only a ring illumination source is needed. Most important, it addresses inherent trade-offs between the size, resolution, and FOV of thin endoscopes. Successful completion of the proposed ptychographic endoscope will enable us to develop thin endoscopes for unmet clinical needs by enabling clinicians to accurately detect and diagnosis diseases, particularly in regions with limited access."
"9236851","Project Summary  The primary goal of the proposed research is to advance the quality of care provided to people with lower limb amputation (LLA) by developing a state-of-the-art, dynamic measurement system that can be incorporated into clinical practices, research studies, and electronic health record systems. Performance-based measurement of important health outcomes, like prosthetic mobility, is widely acknowledged as an important element of professional practice and a primary contributor to positive patient outcomes. Standardized performance-based measures are well suited to measuring clinical patients, but they are inhibited by a structure that requires a patient to complete a large number of tasks, many of which provide limited value to the clinical assessment. Modern measurement methods, which have been successfully applied to enhancing the quality and efficiency of patient-reported measures, can be extended to address inefficiencies in performance-based testing. In this project, we apply advances in psychometric modelling and computer technology to create a dynamic measurement system that targets the capabilities of each individual patient.  In Aim 1, we will develop a bank of tasks suited to measuring mobility of people with LLA in clinical settings. A large, diverse sample of 500 prosthetic limb users will be recruited in a national cross-sectional study to test candidate tasks. Results will be quantitatively analyzed using item response theory (IRT) to create a calibrated bank of performance tasks that can be targeted to patients with similar characteristics (eg, people with LLA due to diabetes) using fixed-length task sets, or targeted to individual patients using computerized adaptive testing (CAT). In Aim 2, we will conduct statistical simulations to maximize the efficiency of the CAT algorithm. We will use information from patient-report outcome measures to identify the first task and unique stopping rules to ensure patients with very high or very low mobility are not unnecessarily burdened. We will develop an application to allow clinicians and researchers to administer the measure, and software to facilitate integration into electronic health record systems. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the reliability, validity, and efficiency of the developed system for measuring mobility in people with LLA. A diverse sample of 100 prosthetic limb users will be recruited to participate in a repeated-measures study. We will compare results from the developed system to existing measures of mobility, balance, and physical function.  Successful completion of this project will provide a valid, reliable, interpretable, and efficient tool for measuring mobility outcomes in people with LLA and a model for enhancing performance-based measurement in other clinical populations."
"9205217","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-1 encounters many obstacles to viral replication in the host cell, which is armed with an intrinsic immune system of antiviral factors with direct antiviral activity, including APOBEC3G, TRIM5alpha, Tetherin, SAMHD1, and Mx2. Our understanding of the mechanism by which these factors inhibit retroviral replication, and how they are evaded by certain viruses has accrued significantly, but is far from complete. Such knowledge could greatly aid the development of new animal models of human disease and novel therapeutic intervention. The goal of this project is to investigate the mechanistic basis fo inhibition of HIV-1 infection by the newly identified factor, Mx2.      The first aim of this project is to identify the cellular requirements for the localization and antviral activity of Mx2. It is unknown how Mx2 interacts with the nuclear pore complex, how it may be involved in regulation of nuclear import, or how the localization of Mx2 at the nuclear pore drives its antiviral activity. Both targeted and non-biased approaches will be employed to precisely identify cellular factors important for the antiviral activity of Mx2. The second aim is to determie the nature of the interaction between Mx2 and the HIV-1 capsid. It is known that the capsid is the determinant of sensitivity or resistance to inhibition by Mx2, but the mechanistic basis for this interaction remains unknown. Independent but complementary biochemical and genetic approaches will be utilized to define the precise interface that determines the antiviral specificiy of Mx2. The knowledge gained by this project will provide an enhanced understanding of how Mx2 inhibits the early stages of HIV-1 infection and can be utilized to develop new, targeted anti-retroviral therapies."

"9312085","The trained ear of the speech-language pathologist is the gold standard assessment tool for clinical practice in motor speech disorders. However, perceptual judgments are vulnerable to bias and their relationship with estimates of listener intelligibility ? the final arbiter of speech goodness ? is indeterminate. Interpretable, objective, and robust outcome measures that provide targets for treatment are urgently needed in order to provide more precise care and reliably monitor patient progress. Based on theoretical models of speech perception, in our previous grants we have developed a novel set of outcome measures that provide a multi- dimensional intelligibility profile (MIP) by using custom speech stimuli and a new coding strategy that allows us to capture the types of errors that listeners make when listening to dysarthric speech. This has led to a more complete intelligibility profile that codifies these errors at different levels of granularity, from global to discrete. Simultaneously, we have also developed a computational model for evaluation of dysarthric speech capable of reliably estimating a limited set of intelligibility measures directly from the speech acoustics. To date, both the outcome measures and the objective model have been evaluated on cross-sectional data only. In this renewal application, our principal goal is to evaluate specific hypotheses regarding expected changes in this multidimensional intelligibility profile as a result of different intervention instruction conditions (loud, clear, slow). A secondary goal of the proposal is to further refine our objective model to predict the complete intelligibility profile and to evaluate its ability to detect intelligibility changes within individual speakers. This is critical for clinicians who currently have no objective ways to assess the value of their interventions. With the aim of improving the standard of care through technology, the long-term goal of this proposal is to develop stand-alone objective outcome measures for dysarthria that can provide clinicians with reliable treatment targets. Such applications have the potential to dramatically alter the current standard of care in speech pathology for patients with neurological disease or injury. Furthermore, these applications also have the potential to reduce health disparities by partially automating clinical intervention and providing easier access to these services to those in remote areas or in underdeveloped countries.  "
"9393226","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human infant is typically sterile in utero and then born into a world dominated by microbes, which selectively assume residence of the body surfaces and enteric tract of the newborn. The assembly of the early human microbiome is particularly an issue relevant to the very low birth weight (VLBW; <1500 g) infant, where infection and activation of immunological and inflammatory responses produce acute morbidity and mortality and exacerbate co-morbid diseases of the eyes, enteric tract, and central nervous system. However, the selective forces that alter primary colonization and secondary persistence of more or less pathogenic microbes within the developing microbiota are not well understood, particularly in humans. Specifically, the extent to which colonization is recognized by the adaptive immune response and how the adaptive responses contribute to shaping the microbiome of the premature infant, and how the microbiome influences concurrent and subsequent adaptive immune development, is poorly understood. The immediate goal of the proposed research is to identify antigens from the pioneering microbiome of the intestine in the preterm infant that are recognized by natural birth antibodies and the adaptive humoral response. This work will then determine whether and how the peripheral and mucosal antibody response alters the dynamics of secondary colonization. The central hypothesis is that natural antibodies present at birth modify primary colonization while antigens of pioneering Gram negative enteric bacteria drive adaptive antibody responses that alter secondary colonization and long-term immune memory. The hypothesis will be addressed through an innovative combination of molecular tools in the following aims: 1) To determine the relationship between natural and adaptive antibodies and colonization of the VLBW infant intestinal tract, 2) To determine the specificity of breast milk IgA to the breast milk microbiome and the early intestinal microbiome in the VLBW infant, and 3) To measure the specific antigens of the neonatal microbiome recognized by antibodies in the first year of life. These studies will uniquely define the constellation of antigens recognized by preterm infant and maternal natural and adaptive antibodies as the infant becomes colonized. By determining the dynamic interface between mucosal antibody response and specific antigens recognized by the newborn human host, new interventions may be envisioned through which to alter primary and secondary colonization of infants through stimulation of natural and adaptive antibodies. In turn these advents may lead to approaches to alter long-term outcomes including infectious diseases, allergy, and metabolic syndrome."
"9232034","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Cancers are a complex conglomerate of heterogeneous cell populations with varying genotypes and phenotypes. Not only are tumors from different patients highly variable, but cellular heterogeneity and clonal diversity even within a single tumor can lead to increased therapeutic resistance, metastasis, and tumor progression. A variety of technologies such as quantitative PCR, mass cytometry and DNA/RNA sequencing methods have yielded important insights into single-cell heterogeneity and its role in the progression and treatment of cancer. Nonetheless, most platforms are limited in the number of single cells that can be automatically captured and processed in parallel, such as 96 cells for Fluidigm's C1 Auto Prep System. To study cancer biology using genetic perturbations, available techniques such as electroporation and viral vectors are highly toxic and inefficient due to the lack of precision in delivery, and are mostly applicable to bulk populations rather than single cells. The proposed research will develop a new nanoneedle-based 3D (x,y,z) actuation technology for manipulating and analyzing single cells on a massively parallel scale. The long term objective of this project is to develop a platform that will increase the throughput of single-cell manipulation and analysis by at least 1000-fold while significantly decreasing costs. The current effort will focus on identifying, manipulating, and characterizing single tumor cells based on their gene expression profiles, and leveraging the technology to perform non-viral based single-cell CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing with high transduction efficiency and minimal invasiveness. Metastatic cell diversity will first be profiled based on high-dimensional gene expression measurements. This will be in conjunction with targeting transcription factors for siRNA knockdowns to benchmark the platform's sensitivity for detecting differential target gene expression. In addition, the proposed technology will use the CRISPR-Cas9 system to deliver sgRNAs with Cas9 into single T cells, cancerous or normal; the goal will be to determine the efficacy of single-cell CRISPR genome editing and investigate the effect on global gene expression, cell function and drug responses. Importantly, these results will be relevant to immunotherapy approaches to treating cancer with engineered T cells. Parameters such as target efficiency, sensitivity/specificity of manipulation and delivery, device functionality after repetitive transduction, uniformity of manipulation across different single cells, as well as precision, reproducibility, hysteresis and stability of the motion of the microrobotic actuator will be optimized. The silicon-based microrobotic actuator is designed such that it can accurately track and target desired positions within single cells under an open loop control without a position feedback sensor, thus avoiding complicated control system electronics. Overall, this technology will provide an unprecedented level of throughput and precision in the manipulation of single and rare cells, accelerating the study of tumor cell heterogeneity."
"9208167","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inhibitory interneurons crucially control information processing in neuronal networks, but their vast molecular and anatomical diversity has made it difficult to dissect their functional roles. The cerebellar cortex with its relatively simple architecture and few neuron subtypes constitutes an ideal model circuit to study interneuron function. In the cerebellar cortex, mossy fibers (MFs) relay sensory information to granule cells (GCs) that send their axons to the molecular layer to excite Purkinje cells (PCs). As the only interneurons of the cerebellar input layer, Golgi cells (GoCs) are strategically positioned to control the propagation of sensory information to the cerebellar output layer. Spontaneously active GoCs inhibit GCs with two distinct time courses: rapid phasic inhibition that narrows the time window for excitatory input integration, and persistent tonic inhibition that controls the gai of incoming signals. Moreover, GoCs are thought to mediate the slow oscillations observed in the GC layer prior to the onset of motor behaviors. Strong electrical coupling between GoCs permits these oscillations that coordinate large assemblies of GCs. Although it is well established that GoCs crucially determine the flow of information within the cerebellar cortex, less is known about the mechanisms that orchestrate GoC firing, regulate GoC activity, and dynamically control GC excitability. Contrary to current beliefs in the field, preliminary data supports the hypothesis that active GoC dendrites enhance electric coupling. This proposal thus seeks to determine the cellular mechanisms that enable GoCs to fire synchronously using two-photon calcium imaging, patch clamp electrophysiology, voltage imaging and array tomography. Preliminary results also suggest that GoC activity dictates dendritic calcium concentration. The planned experiments will therefore examine the functional relationship between GoC activity and dendritic calcium dynamics, and determine the consequences for synaptic plasticity of excitatory PF and MF input. Preliminary data indicates that activation of metabotropic receptors on GoCs suppresses firing, and that this suppression is accompanied by a decrease in tonic inhibition of GCs. With the help of electrophysiology and optogenetics, this proposal will therefore test the hypothesis that dynamic modulation of GoC firing rate controls GC excitability and MF input integration. Completion of the outlined work will elucidate the mechanisms that control integration of sensory information by varying the activity of a single interneuron subtype in the cerebellar cortex. It will also extend our general understanding of how inhibition governs computational processes in neural networks."
"9277735","Abstract:  Cellular oxidative stress is a major cause of illness and death worldwide, and many are turning to Natural Products or Complementary and Alternative Medicines to combat this condition. The current study is intended to identify constituents in the very popular Acai berry (Euterpe Oleracea) with the potential to reduce oxidative stress, thereby preventing the pathogenic conditions associated with disruptions in redox balance. In addition, the study will identify biological targets for these constituents, thus providing insight into the mechanism by which this ?superfruit? confers these protective efects in humans. An essential element of the proposed study is that undergraduate and Master's level students at The University of North Carolina at Greensboro will have opportunities to engage in meaningful scientific research aimed at elucidating details regarding the mechanism of action of one of the most popular anti-oxidant natural products on the market. The popularity of the Acait has not translated to a wealth of scientific research regarding its effects, thus the study also fills an important void in science, that if filled could greatly enhance efforts to capitalize on the health benefits of this product.  The two main targets to be explored in this study are (1) Cytochrome P450 enzymes that may be able to initiate production of reactive chemical species, including reactive oxygen species (ROS), and (2) the Nrf2-dependent transcriptional regulatory pathway by which an entire battery of anti-oxidant genes may be turned on in response to cellular signals that report on overall redox balance. The methods to be employed include in vitro catalytic assays for the two human cytochrome P450 isozymes, P4502E1 and P4502A6, and a luciferase-based cell culture system in which a reporter plasmid containing a genetic element called an ?antioxidant response element? will be used to assess the ability of constituents in the acai berry extract to up-regulate gene transcription. Elements of this type are present in a large number of human genes associated with anti-oxidant functions. The process of fractionation and isolation of the individual constituents used in each of the different assays will be guided by the observed activities associated with each different fraction, and modern methods of NMR and Mass Spectral characterization will be used to determine the chemical identity of the active constituents."
"9405057","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inflammation is known to have a paradoxical effect on cancers being able to both promote and inhibit the growth of tumors. It is known that crosstalk between the endocrine and immune systems play key roles in determining the phenotypes and outcomes of hormone dependent cancers such as breast cancer. The studies outlined in this proposal are poised to determine how the estrogen and proinflammatory signaling pathways converge in cancer cells to regulate the expression of many genes important for initiation, growth and metastasis. The responses of cancer cells to estrogens and proinflammatory signaling molecules are largely mediated by DNA binding proteins, known as transcription factors, that bind to regulatory regions of the genome to change the expression of many target genes. More specifically, this study will focus the inflammatory-mediated mechanisms that influence the function of the pioneer transcription factor FoxA1. The preliminary data for this research proposal shows that proinflammatory signaling, in cooperation with estrogen signaling, causes FoxA1 to bind to regions of the genome that were thought to be dormant or latent in breast cancer cells. This, in turn, activates the expression of a novel set of genes that are stron predictors of clinical outcomes in breast cancer patients. This work is significant because it provides a framework for the integration of two of the major signaling cascades that exacerbate tumorigenesis. The applicant will use state-of-the-art molecular biology, genomic and proteomic methodologies in both cell-based and mouse models of breast cancer, to address the aims of this study. This integrated approach will allow for systematic analysis of FoxA1 function, and the downstream consequences, during proinflammatory signaling in breast cancer. The goal of the applicant is to use the academic, research and leadership training received during the tenure of this award to successfully transition into an independent tenure track faculty position. As the principal investigator of a competitive research group at a major university or medical center, the motivation for the science being done in the applicant's laboratory will be to discover new avenues for the prevention and treatment of cancer by understanding how gene regulation and cell signaling influence cancer biology. To date, the applicant's research demonstrates an aptitude for molecular biology, biochemistry and next-generation sequencing technologies and the goal for the mentored phase of training is to gain experience with the use of proteomics and animal models. UT Southwestern Medical Center is an idea location for completion of the mentored phase because it is a research-oriented university that provides an exceptional and highly interactive scientific and intellectual environment. UT Southwestern's research faculty include 18 members of the National Academy of Sciences, 13 members of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and five Nobel Laureates. Frequent interactions with the candidate's primary mentor and advisory committee will continue to develop the research techniques, scientific knowledge and leadership skills needed to transition into an independent career."
"9117200","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes the framework of an R01 grant by Dr. Daniel Lingwood, an Assistant Professor at Harvard Medical School and faculty member of the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, and Dr. Bryce Chackerian, an Associate Professor in the Department of Molecular Genetics & Microbiology at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine. Their research centers on B cell antigen recognition (Lingwood) and directed evolution of virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine platforms (Chackerian). Together they propose to develop a key vaccine-priming step that will predispose for elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) responses to HIV-1. Recent data has shown that when humanized mice are genetically constrained to use the antibody VH gene IGHV1-202, early stages of VRC01-class responses are observed following immunization with the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env). VRC01-class antibodies neutralize ~90% of viral stains through a remarkable converge of structure aimed at CD4 receptor mimicry and engagement of Env. This group of antibodies is found in multiple infected individuals and always arises via use of IGVH1-202, suggesting there may be a mechanistic basis for specific bnAb development. The humanized mouse data indicates that vaccine- induced VRC01-like responses may be possible in humans if the responding antibody repertoire can be initially biased towards IGHV1-202, akin to the genetically engineered VH-restriction in mice. However, selective targeting and expansion of a VH-specific B cell pool is challenging as the germline B cell receptor (BCR) consists of hypervariable features, most notably, the stochastically-derived CDRH3 loop which dominates antigen-interactions. In this application, Dr. Lingwood and Dr. Chackerian propose to engineer IGVH1-202- selective B cell priming agents by evolving VLPs that display multivalent and high affinity binding to a specific genetically encoded feature of this B cell lineage, its CDRH2 loop. This motif forms the critical contact engendering broad neutralization of HIV-1 during VRC01-class development. The research team has already shown that their RNA bacteriophage technology for peptide display and affinity selection can be applied to generate VLPs which target and activate specific BCR sequences in vitro, and that these VLPs are immunogenic in transgenic mice expressing the complete human antibody repertoire. Dr. Lingwood and Dr. Chackerian will now apply this pipeline to develop and test whether VLP immunogens, by virtue of engineered high affinity for a genetically preserved BCR motif, can selectively prime the IGVH1-202 B cell response. If successful, the team will have developed both generalized methodology for expanding VH-specific B cells of interest and in the case of IGHV1-202, will have provided the first step and critical component of a vaccine to initiate VRC01-class responses in humans. Exploiting genetic bases for bnAb elicitation aims to overcome the failure of traditional approaches to HIV-1 vaccination and is consistent with the purpose of this funding opportunity and broader mission of the NIH."
"9335705","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Members of the Candida genus of fungi form part of the normal human microbiota but are also opportunistic pathogens capable of causing serious mucosal and systemic infections. Candida cells grow and divide in suspension (planktonic) cultures, but they also form resilient and drug resistant biofilms ? organized, tightly- packed communities of cells attached to a surface. Biofilms colonize many niches of the human body and can also form on implanted medical devices, where they are a major source of new infections in patients. Mortality rates from Candida infections are particularly high in immunocompromised individuals, where life-threatening colonization and invasion of parenchymal organs can occur once the infection has disseminated through the bloodstream. Because (1) the mortality rate of disseminated infections is high (approximately 50 percent), (2) biofilms are a major source of these infections, and (3) biofilms are also resistant to current antifungal drugs, rapid and early detection of biofilm formation is critical for improving disease outcome. The Craik laboratory at UCSF (collaborators on this proposal) recently developed a novel mass spectrometry-based screening technology to identify the global substrate specificity and kinetic efficiency of proteases in complex biological mixtures. This technology, referred to as Multiplex Substrate Profiling by Mass Spectrometry (MSP-MS), allows for unbiased and simultaneous detection of all protease activities in a given sample; it employs a library of rationally designed peptide substrates and monitors their cleavage. In consultation with the Craik laboratory, we have applied this global profiling strategy to identify biofilm-specific, planktonic-specific, and broad- spectrum protease activities with the goal of developing protease-cleavable fluorogenic substrates that will enable the rapid and sensitive enzymatic detection of biofilm and disseminated infections from a broad range of Candida species. Through this profiling of the C. albicans secreted proteome, we have identified two secreted aspartyl proteases, Sap5 and Sap6, and a subtilisin-like serine protease, Kex2, that are produced by C. albicans biofilms. We have developed first-generation fluorogenic substrates specific for each activity; genetic experiments (using C. albicans strains deleted for a given protease) have confirmed that these substrates show high specificity for their target protease. We have also shown that these same substrates can detect proteolytic activity from other pathogenic Candida species. Finally, we have demonstrated that the Sap6-cleavable fluorogenic substrate can detect infection-specific activity in serum isolated from rats that have an implanted catheter infected with a C. albicans biofilm. Based on these preliminary results, in Phase I of this R43 proposal, we propose to develop a protease-profiling pipeline for the discovery of additional proteases secreted from C. albicans and other pathogenic Candida species. Optimized protease-cleavable fluorogenic substrates will be continually developed, refined, and tested for their ability to accurately detect Candida biofilms and planktonic cells grown in vitro (Aim 1) and in vivo using a preclinical murine catheter biofilm model and a murine disseminated infection model (Aim 2). In Phase II of this award, we will translate these discoveries to humans by evaluating the clinical efficacy of our protease activity-based approach for Candida biofilm and disseminated infection detection. The eventual goal is the development of an optimized substrate kit for the rapid diagnosis of biofilm-associated and disseminated infections."
"9414179","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While there is a large body of literature suggesting that early word learning is critical for the later development of oral and written language, the processes by which problems in word learning interact with deficits in other aspects of linguistic knowledge are not well understood, nor is it clear whether deficits in vocabulary size impact later language development equally depending on their source. A better understanding of these interactions are critical because small vocabularies in early childhood place children at significant risk for delays in acquiring both spoken and written language. This study proposes to begin to fill in some of these gaps in our understanding by examining the relationships among components of phonological knowledge (including the ability to perceive speech sounds in challenging listening tasks, the ability to robustly differentiate among speech sounds in production, and the ability to make inferences about how sounds function in the language being acquired) and lexical acquisition in children with a wide range of vocabulary sizes, where size varies for different reasons across groups. The proposed research is a longitudinal study from 30 to 60 months of age of approximately 200 children with a wide variety of initial vocabulary sizes resulting from a range of advantages or deficits in the types of phonological knowledge that support word learning. The specific research question addressed is: what are the developmental relationships among vocabulary growth and three types of phonological knowledge (speech production knowledge, speech perception knowledge, and higher-level categorical knowledge) for children with normal hearing from middle-SES and low-SES families, and for children with cochlear implants (CIs)? The study will include three groups of children: one, children from low-SES families, who have smaller vocabularies than peers from middle-SES families because of more limited linguistic input (among other factors); two, children with cochlear implants, who have smaller vocabularies than peers with normal hearing because of their perceptual limitations; and three, children from middle-SES families with a wide range of vocabulary sizes, including a sizeable number of late talkers (i.e., children who have small expressive vocabularies at age 2, in spite of normal sensory functioning, normal cognitive development, and age-appropriate receptive vocabularies). The study also includes a statistical modeling component to determine optimal interventions for children with small-sized vocabularies. Structural equation modeling, based on data from this rich longitudinal sample, will allow us to test what interventions might be most effective to increase vocabulary for these different groups of children. Ultimately, the knowledge obtained from this study will enable us to develop efficacious and targeted early interventions for young children with atypically small vocabularies."
"9192200","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT It was reported that in 2009 alone, 32% of all deaths in the US resulted from cardiovascular disease, including acute coronary syndrome, stroke/transient ischemic attack, and peripheral artery disease. Underlying these pathologies is increased platelet activity. Platelets play an essential role in hemostasis and thrombosis. Following vascular and tissue damage, platelets rapidly adhere to the site of injury and secrete granular contents that recruit and activate additional platelets, culminating in the formation of thrombi through the interaction between integrin ?IIb?3 and fibrinogen. Because of the essential role of integrin ?IIb?3 in platelet thrombus formation, antagonists of the integrin have been developed. However, direct inhibition of ligand binding to integrin ?IIb?3 could impair hemostasis and increase the risk of bleeding. Thus, many efforts have been put forward to develop inhibitors blocking integrin ?IIb?3 function or signaling. Numerous studies have now characterized the role of thiol-disulfide bond exchange as a regulatory mechanism for integrin ?IIb?3. Using real-time intravital microscopy, we and others demonstrated that the isomerase activity of cell surface protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), a prototypical thiol isomerase, plays a critical role in regulating integrin ?3 activation and thrombus formation at the site of vascular injury, thereby suggesting PDI to be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of thrombosis. However, blocking extracellular PDI compromised hemostatic function in mice as assessed by tail bleeding times. These results warrant the need for further research into how extracellular PDI activity is regulated following vascular injury. In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), PDI catalyzes thiol-disulfide oxidation, reduction, and isomerization during protein folding and ER oxidoreductin 1? (ERO1?) is the key protein responsible for accepting the electrons from reduced PDI to oxidize PDI, regenerating its activity. In this comprehensive proposal, we will test the hypothesis that platelet surface ERO1? modulates the ligand-binding function of integrin ?IIb?3 by controlling PDI activity and facilitates platelet aggregation during thrombosis. The proposed studies will provide mechanistic insight into an innovative approach to downregulate the ligand-binding function of integrin ?IIb?3 by inhibition of the ERO1?-PDI signaling axis and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies."
"9288938","The synaptic connections in our brain form circuits that control all mental activity and behavior. How these connections are specified during brain development and function is largely unknown. The problem is difficult to study in humans or model mammals because the synaptic connections in the large brains of these species cannot currently be determined. Some mental illnesses may be due to abnormalities in synaptic connectivity?the inability to address this possibility in the absence of known connectivity is a major barrier to understanding such diseases. This study focusses on specification of synaptic connectivity in the only animal where detailed maps of synaptic connections are available. In the nematode worm, Caenorhabditis elegans, the wiring diagram, or connectome, of the entire nervous system has been determined. The C. elegans genome contains a similar set of neural cell adhesion genes thought to specify connectivity as humans. The function of these and additional genes will be studied in a neural network in the male. The expression patterns of neural cell adhesion genes in the neural network has been determined. The function of multiple neural cell adhesion genes in specification of a particular synaptic connection will be examined in detail in genetic and molecular studies. The binding properties of neural cell adhesion proteins involved in synapse formation will be determined in biochemical studies. The complement of neural cell adhesion genes that specify different connections will be compared and their activities in ectopic contexts will be examined. The aim is to uncover the molecular determinants of connectivity in the network. The results will allow studies in higher animals to focus on genes with known functions in defining neural circuits."

"9244245","ABSTRACT Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) are associated with more severe disease but less transmissibility after infection of humans than are seasonal influenza viruses. Animal models and limited studies of single or small clusters of AIV human cases have been utilized to understand the underlying mechanisms with varying success and inference. Hampering scientific progress to a substantial degree has been the historically sporadic nature of human AIV cases, making comparative and extensive prospective studies unfeasible. The emergence of the H7N9 AIV in China has now changed this. These H7N9 cases are associated with a predictable spatial and temporal pattern that makes it feasible to consider a cohort study. Here, we propose to conduct a longitudinal study to identify the immunological and virological hallmarks of AIV infections in humans. Our study will test two hypotheses: 1) severe disease caused by H7N9 AIVs is a consequence of a lack of early cross- protective CD8+ T-cell responses, and, 2) replication of AIVs in the mammalian host limits virus population diversity which in turn limits onwards transmission. Southern China is a particularly important region for human cases of AIV due to its high density of humans and domestic poultry. Our proposed study site at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, which is also a designated National Reference Center for Respiratory Diseases, is perfectly suited for this study. The completion of the above aims will lead to the most comprehensive analysis of AIV infections in humans to date and also to a direct side-by-side comparison with seasonal influenza. Critical cross training of US and Chinese scientists will also be a major milestone leading to improved global public health research capacity."
"9271672","ABSTRACT HIV incidence remains stable among men who have sex with men (MSM) in the United States, and increasing in some groups, despite highly effective antiretroviral-based prevention tools such as preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Open-label PrEP demonstration projects have yielded strong evidence for the ?real-world? prevention benefits of PrEP, with high adherence in these settings leading to virtually no incident infections. Yet critical questions remain about the future epidemiological impact of PrEP among MSM at the population level. Our preliminary work used mathematical modeling to estimate the impact of CDC?s clinical practice guidelines for PrEP, with policy-oriented outcomes that supported comprehensive HIV prevention planning efforts. Because of limitations in model parameter data, however, these models required assumptions about the generalizability of sexual network structures, profiles of PrEP and ART adherence, and stability in other prevention strategies when simulating specific interventions. This proposed project will collect new data among a sample of MSM from 15 high-burden US cities and use those data for multi-level (national and city-specific) models of HIV transmission. These modeling activities will address the limitations of the earlier research by broadening its epidemiological and geographic scope, and provide new insight into novel targeting and adherence strategies informed by the structure and dynamics of MSM sexual partnerships. Our specific aims are to: 1) Conduct an internet-based survey (ART-Net) of MSM living in 15 high HIV burden metropolitan areas to collect sexual network structure and use of and adherence to PrEP and ART as prevention; 2) Extend our network-based HIV microsimulation model to incorporate new behavioral and clinical parameters from the ART-Net data, and use Bayesian statistical methods for parameter validation and model calibration to adjust ART-Net data to account for the internet-based sampling methods by triangulating with key secondary data sources (external behavioral and clinical data; PrEP demonstration projects; HIV surveillance information); and 3) Model the HIV transmission dynamics and implementation of combination antiretroviral prevention among MSM nationally and by city using the validated parameters, with the goal of estimating the future epidemiological impact (infections averted) and efficiency (number needed to treat) of scaling-up these tools according to different strategies that are specific to the local epidemiological context of HIV transmission among MSM in each city. Completion of these aims will provide critically needed empirical data and software tools for HIV modeling researchers, and robust model-based estimates of ART intervention impact geared towards supporting the development of locally tailored HIV planning activities."

"9215660","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It has been established that proteins (and thus, their peptide products) are ribosomally translated using only L-amino acids, and so it was assumed that D-amino acids did not naturally exist in animal peptides. However, physiological D-amino containing-peptides (DAACP) do exist, first identified in frogs, resulting from a post-translationa modification: peptide isomerization. However, because they have no associated mass shift, DAACPs are historically very difficult to identify, causing a gap in mass spectrometry-driven peptide characterization studies. The objective of the proposed work aims to bridge this gap by developing tools to detect DAACPs by taking advantage of their unique properties, including their resistance to degradation by peptidases. In addition, formation of a DAACP alters the shape of a peptide, which can change its ability to bind to a receptor. This is especially important for neuropeptides, cell-cell signaling molecules that are bioactive by binding to their cognate receptor. Thus, in specific aim 1, the tools to identify DAACPs will be developed using neuropeptides from a simpler model animal, where one DAACP has already been identified. This system of DAACP discovery involves chiral analysis: breaking down an endogenous neuropeptide into its component amino acids and assaying those amino acids for their chirality using analytical chemistry methods. The long-term objective of this work is to identify functional DAACPs in the mammalian nervous system. As part of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) program areas, it is interested in the function of neurotransmitters (like neuropeptides) in endogenous systems. In spite of intensive study, more than 100 human G-protein coupled receptors have no known binding partner. DAACPs may explain, in part, the discrepancy between the number of neuropeptides known through genomic and peptidomic studies and the large number of orphan receptors. For the proposed work, in specific aim 2, neuropeptides will be studied for peptide isomerization in the context of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a hypothalamic group of neurons with a known role in circadian rhythms. The SCN is targeted because there are extensive studies on time of day release of neuropeptides and a number of peptidase-resistant peptides have already been identified in the SCN. This work is significant because NIDA has identified sleep disorders as having a link to drug abuse, so the implication of an overlooked PTM can result in many missed neuropeptide functions in our sleep/wake cycles. The discovery of DAACPs as a physiological phenomenon in mammalian neuropeptides ultimately helps reach the goal of understanding drug abuse by identifying the functional properties of neural circuits underlying drug abuse."
"9242892","Project Summary/Abstract My laboratory seeks to understand how proteases, key biological regulators that act by cleaving other molecules, govern cellular behaviors and the roles of such protease signaling in embryonic development, adult physiology and disease. We discovered and characterized Protease-Activated Receptors (PARs). These molecules span the cell membrane, sense extracellular protease activity and transmit this information inside the cell to trigger responses. Proteases trigger signaling by cleaving PARs at a specific site to unmask an activator that is part of the receptor but hidden until uncovered by the protease. This work revealed how thrombin, a key blood clotting enzyme, activates blood platelets, the small cells that plug broken blood vessels to stop bleeding or diseased arteries to cause heart attacks and strokes. These discoveries led to a new type of antithrombotic drug (vorapaxar/Zontivity). The work also uncovered unexpected roles for protease signaling in endothelial, smooth muscle, and epithelial cells, neurons and other cell types, many of which remain largely unexplored. We seek to build on this foundation to better understand how PARs function as signaling machines and their roles in normal biology and disease. Our future work will focus on three important areas: 1) The structural basis of how PAR1 becomes active upon cleavage by thrombin, transmits information across the cell membrane, and chooses the signaling proteins that couple to the inside of the activated receptor and transmit information to the cell's interior. 2) The role of PAR signaling in the vessel wall in the formation and maintenance of blood vessels in the embryo and adult. 3) The role of protease signaling in regulating the behavior of epithelia, organized sheets of cells that separate compartments and play critical roles for the formation and function of the heart, lungs, kidneys, gut, liver, endocrine and exocrine glands, brain, skin and other organs. Success in our studies will advance our understanding of PARs themselves and of the large family of receptors to which they belong (G protein-coupled receptors - key regulators and drug targets). It will also advance our understanding of the mechanisms that govern the formation and function of blood vessels and epithelia, with potential broad impact."
"9207418","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goals of this project are to understand the molecular basis for a group of closely related congenital myopathies and muscular dystrophies, and to use this information to develop therapies for patients with these debilitating conditions. X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is caused by mutations of the MTM1 gene, which encodes myotubularin, an enzyme lipid phosphatase important for biogenesis and function of T tubules, which are the structures in skeletal muscles responsible for transmitting the signal to contract to the contractile apparatus. The centronuclear myopathies (CNMs), of which XLMTM is a subtype, also include forms caused by mutations in the RYR1, DNM2, and BIN1 genes, which are all known or thought to play a role in excitation contraction coupling (ECC) at the triads. Some families with CNM have mutations in genes that have yet to be identified. The specific aims of this proposal are 1) to conduct studies designed to evaluate the potential for myostatin-inhibition therapy in a mouse model of XLMTM and 2) to complete the identification of the various genes that cause human CNMs and related myopathies. Each of the genes shown to cause a form of human CNM will then 3) be modeled in existing or new targeted zebrafish mutants, and 4) these lines will be characterized and developed for use in high throughput drug screens to identify lead compounds with therapeutic potential for these and related disorders of ECC in patients with primary myopathies and muscular dystrophies. The successful conclusion of these studies will result in development of accurate genetic tests to diagnose these conditions in affected children and family members, allowing for reliable family planning to avoid the birth of additional affected children. Furthermore, the identification of new drugs and small molecules that slow or prevent the development of weakness in the mouse and zebrafish models used in this study will set the stage for preclinical testing of new therapies that may one day be used to treat children with these devastating neuromuscular diseases."

"9297590","In contrast to left ventricular assist devices used in end stage cardiac disease patients, there are few available bridging devices available for end stage lung disease patients. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) devices have a significant role in short term acute neonatal respiratory diseases and a more limited role in acute adult respiratory diseases. However, ECMO requires hospitalization in critical care units and specialized health care providers. As such, it is not a practical or cost effective option for long term bridging to lung transplant. New innovative cost-effective easily implementable technologies are desperately needed. We have extensively studied ex vivo lung bioengineering with focus on de- and recellularization of mammalian lungs. This includes developing potential transplantation strategies creating ex vivo autologous lungs from decellularized cadaveric or failed donor lungs recellularized with cells obtained from the eventual transplant recipient. This is a powerful rapidly evolving promising approach. However, a number of significant hurdles remain including recapitulating appropriate gas exchange and respiratory physiology. As opposed to mammalian lungs, avian lungs are static multilayered structures in which gas exchange occurs by cross current exchange and is more efficient than the more complex ventilation required by mammalian lungs. As such, avian lungs could provide a potentially novel and effective bioscaffold for use as lung assist devices and possibly also in transplantation schemes. The central hypothesis of this proposal therefore is that decellularized avian lungs, recellularized with human lung epithelial, endothelial, and stromal cells, and subsequently with relevant lung stem and progenitor cells, will therefore provide a novel and more powerful gas exchange unit than recellularized mammalian lungs. The recellularized avian lungs could be utilized as independent hospital (ICU)-based units, comparable to ECMO, portable units, comparable to portable dialysis devices or insulin pumps, or as gas exchange units implantable into the thoracic cavity. These objectives will be investigated in the following Specific Aims: 1. To fully characterize de- and recellularization of representative avian lungs. 2. To develop initial technologies for novel Avian Lung Assist Devices (ALAD) incorporating recellularized avian lungs that could be potentially utilized for independent, portable, or implantable lung assist devices. The aims will be pursued in collaboration between lung biologist Daniel Weiss and engineers Patrick Lee and Dryver Huston. The intellectual property and technology developed from these studies will be subsequently licensed for further industry-based development."
"9370218","PROJECT SUMMARY  Armed with an increasingly clear picture of the complex biomolecular mechanisms of disease onset and progression, clinical oncology is poised to realize the promise of personalized medicine by applying multiplexed analytical tools for improved diagnostic, prognostic, and theranostic capabilities. However, there are, in general, a lack of suitable technologies to support multiplexed analyses in the clinic?particularly with respect to the analysis of disease-relevant miRNA and protein panels, despite their clearly established utility.  Complex and aberrant mechanisms underlying cancer onset and progression can only be unraveled through the measurement of multiple biomarker signatures and at both the miRNA and protein level, a wealth of putative biomarkers have been identified that show enhanced predictive value when considered together with panels of other markers. However, many discovery technologies are not amenable to the clinic. For miRNAs, qRT-PCR assays are incredibly sensitive, relatively rapid, and cost effective, yet are only able to quantitate expression of a single target per assay. Conversely, microarrays are readily multiplexable, yet quite slow and expensive. Thus, there exists a pressing need for meso-plex diagnostic capabilities whereby focused panels of 10s of miRNAs can be simultaneously interrogated using rapid, cost effective, and highly scalable technologies. Again, there is a striking gap in analytical capabilities that limit the translation of multiplexed proteomics into the clinic. The gold standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), is typically very sensitive, selective, and cost effective, though most often single-plex. Protein microarrays are highly multiplexable, but generally far less sensitive, less selective, and not amenable to the clinical setting. Emerging multiplexed analysis methodologies offer some improvements but have yet to find widespread clinical utility.  Chip-integrated silicon photonic sensor arrays have recently emerged as an inherently scalable and multiplexable biomolecular analysis technology, and this proposal aims to robustly validate this powerful technology for meso-plex cancer diagnostics. Silicon photonic microring resonator arrays, having up to 128 uniquely address-able sensor elements, have been previously utilized to quantitatively detect nucleic acid and protein signatures in multiplexed assay formats and from within complex, clinically-relevant sample matrices. Importantly, the technology has its origin in well-established methods of semiconductor processing and sensor array chips can be scalably fabricated to allow low cost assays (<$1/measurement). Furthermore, the molecular generality of this methodology will be utilized to simultaneous profile miRNA and protein expression from the same clinical sample?a transformative capability. Although applicable to any cancer, the lethal brain cancer glioblastoma multiforme will be the laboratory and clinical model. Well-established miRNA and protein biomarkers exist for glioblastoma, thus keeping the proposed efforts entirely on technology validation."
"9403292","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is an application for renewal of a longstanding program to provide intensive training in modern methods of nephrologic research to clinically trained individuals with the M.D. or M.D./Ph.D. degree. Continued funding of seven stipends per year is requested for this joint training program that provides support for both adult and pediatric nephrology fellows. Although the highest priority of this program is to train physician-scientists, basic scientist trainees with the Ph.D. degree who are strongly committed to careers in kidney research are also supported whenever possible. Each year 3-4 new trainees are recruited into the program after completing residency training in internal medicine or pediatrics. Only fellows with a strong commitment to multi-year research training are recruited into the program. Training is provided in both laboratory-based and patient-oriented research. The training faculty is drawn from multiple clinical and basic science departments (Internal Medicine, Pediatrics, Biomedical Engineering, Cellular and Molecular Physiology, Cell Biology, Epidemiology and Public Health, Genetics, Immunobiology, Pathology, Pharmacology) and spans diverse biomedical disciplines relevant to kidney disease research (electrolyte physiology and pathophysiology, cell biology and experimental pathology, genetics and developmental biology, immunology and transplantation, vascular biology, tissue engineering, and clinical epidemiology and biostatistics). Although the core of research training is provided through work on a selected research topic under the supervision of an individual preceptor, training is enhanced by a broad array of teaching conferences, seminars and courses. Indeed, many recent fellows have enrolled in graduate degree programs specifically designed for training clinician investigators including the Investigative Medicine Ph.D. program, and the Program in Chronic Disease Epidemiology that leads to a Master of Science in Epidemiology and Public Health. Over the past 35 years this program has trained many leaders in academic nephrology, and the recent track record continues to be outstanding. The overwhelming majority of trainees who completed training during the past 10 years currently hold either full-time academic positions or research-related positions in industry, and many have successfully competed for career development faculty grants from the NIH or American Heart Association (e.g. K08, K23, Fellow-to-Faculty Transition Award) or have already obtained NIH R01 grants. The program also has made progress in achieving ethnic diversity, as four current fellows are underrepresented minority trainees."

"9403413","Project Summary  Microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs) generate specific arrangements of microtubules that are essential for many cellular functions, including cell division, polarization, and migration. Different subcellular sites can function as the MTOC in order to accommodate these different processes, and here we seek to understand how different MTOC locations are established during development. To divide, animal cells use centrosomes as MTOCs, localizing specific proteins to grow and anchor microtubules in order to build the mitotic spindle; the microtubules then promote the correct formation of two daughter cells. In differentiating cells, like some epithelial cells, the location of the MTOC changes: microtubule-organizing proteins leave the centrosome and move to a membrane surface, an ?MTOC switch? establishing the membrane as the MTOC.  Epithelial cells have distinctive shapes and stick together tightly to form cellular sheets, and the microtubule configuration generated by the membrane MTOC is important for the structure and function of these cells. However, this arrangement of microtubules does not permit division, raising an important question: when an epithelial cell divides, how does it change the location of its MTOC to reorganize its microtubules into the mitotic spindle? Microtubule reorganization is critical for regulating cell division and shape both in normal development and in cancer. Centrosomal defects are classic hallmarks of many cancers [1], and recent studies have shown that increasing the microtubule organizing activity of the centrosome causes epithelial cells to divide more readily and display invasive behavior [11,12]. Despite its importance, little is known about how cells control their microtubule organization and the consequent effect on cell division and shape.  The goal of this proposal is to understand how epithelial cells establish specific MTOC locations for different functions and how the change in MTOC location is coordinated with cell division. The cell cycle is a tightly controlled process that uses a series of checkpoints to ensure that a cell is prepared for division. Here we propose a series of genetic and biochemical experiments in intestinal epithelial cells in the model organism C. elegans to determine how the cell cycle and MTOC location are coordinated. Our lab has recently optimized a new strategy for targeted protein degradation. This method, coupled with recent methods for genome editing, will allow us to uncover the molecular connection between cell cycle regulators and microtubule organization. Aim 1 will use both new and classic genetic approaches to determine which cell cycle genes regulate the MTOC location. Aim 2 will use complementary genetic and biochemical methods to identify which of these proteins tether microtubules to specific locations. In Aim 3, a genetic screen will uncover new regulators of the coordination of MTOC location and cell cycle. As the majority of cancers are epithelial in origin, we expect that understanding how epithelial cells coordinate their MTOC with cell division will be relevant to cancer biology and may lead to the discovery of useful cancer biomarkers or therapeutic targets."
"9398188","ABSTRACT Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the most common cause of congenital viral infection and an important cause of morbidity and mortality following solid organ and hematopoietic cell transplantation. Understanding how the immune system responds to HCMV is vital to the efforts to achieve efficient eradication of infection. This proposal aims to identify novel relationships between NK cells and T cells during HCMV infection, with the central hypothesis that a strong T cell response to HCMV infection can abrogate the emergence of an NK memory phenotype; reciprocally, a HCMV-activated NK cell can regulate the magnitude of the T-cell response. Using a unique fully autologous in vitro HCMV infection system, regulatory relationships between NK cells and T cells can be investigated and identified. Preliminary studies have generated the novel finding that direct interaction of NK cells with HCMV-infected dendritic cells induces PD-L1 surface expression on NK cells, which directly inhibits antibody-mediated T cell proliferation. To determine the impact of PDL1+ NK cell on HCMV antigen specific T cells, T cell responses to HCMV infection will be stimulated by the use of an artificial antigen-presenting cell pulsed with CMVpp65 peptides. Co-incubation of CMV-activated PDL1+ NK cells and CMV- sensitized T cells will permit elucidation of regulatory effects of one lymphocyte on the other. Additionally, preliminary data from an in vivo murine model has recapitulated findings in the human studies, showing a significant increase in the number of PDL1+ NK cells following MCMV infection of C57BL/6 mice. Using genetically novel murine systems, the in vivo impact of PDL1+ NK cells on MCMV-specific T cell responses and the efficiency of viral clearance will be determined. These murine models will allow for correlation of strength of the NK cell response with CMV-specific T cell responses and will also provide insight to how this relationship is controlled. The understanding of NK and T cell relationships developed in the in vitro and in vivo studies will be applied to the study of expansion and maintenance of adaptive NKG2C+ NK cells in healthy human donors as well as in patients with CMV reactivation following stem cell transplantation. The availability of blood samples from a cohort of hematopoietic cell transplant patients with CMV reactivation provides the unique opportunity to examine the NK and T cell repertoire in the setting of CMV infection. These studies will describe novel mechanisms that will expand existing knowledge on the balance of the adaptive and innate immune systems during viral infection and will provide further insight to mechanisms that can be targeted to prevent reactivation and chronic viral infection."
"9198213","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) is a group of proteins that catalyzes Histone 3 Lysine 27 (H3K27) tri-methylation (H3K27me3). The core subunits EZH2, EED, SUZ12 and RbAp4/7 are required for catalytic activity. Alterations in PRC2 have been identified in numerous human cancers. The histone methyltransferase EZH2 is overexpressed in breast and prostate cancer, and activating Y641 mutations have been identified in lymphoma. Inactivating EZH2 mutations occur in myeloid malignancies, and the histone variant H3.3K27M mutation that inhibits EZH2, resulting in a global loss of H3K27me3, is present in pediatric glioblastoma. This suggests that there are cell-type specific functions PRC2 in tumorigenesis. In melanoma, Y641 mutations and EZH2 amplification are found in 1% and 6% of cases, respectively. However, the exact role of PRC2 in melanoma has yet to be determined. To understand the function of EZH2 in melanoma, we used our existing zebrafish melanoma model. Zebrafish melanocytes that express oncogenic BRAF(V600E) and concurrently harbor a p53 loss of function develop melanoma. We ectopically expressed EZH2, EZH2-Y641F/N, H3.3 and H3.3K27M in zebrafish BRAF(V600E);p53-/- melanocytes and compared the rate of tumor formation. Surprisingly, H3.3K27M accelerated melanoma onset, but overexpression of wild-type H3.3, EZH2 or EZH2 mutants Y641F/N did not. This data suggests that loss of EZH2 methyltransferase activity promotes melanoma initiation in collaboration with BRAF(V600E), but gain of function mutants in EZH2 do not. To our knowledge these are the first in vivo data demonstrating the effect of PRC2 deregulation in an animal model of melanoma. We hypothesize that PRC2 activity loss alters the expression of bivalent genes, which are genes marked by activating (H3K4me3) and repressive (H3K27me3) histone marks. The expression of bivalent genes is tightly regulated because the genes are critically involved in the maintenance of proper differentiation. To investigate the role of EZH2 loss of function, we will use human melanoma cells and our zebrafish melanoma model. We will characterize the proliferative, epigenetic and gene expression changes that result using an inducible system in human melanoma cells. Next, we will integrate our epigenetic and gene expression results with human melanoma data to generate a set of candidate bivalent genes that are altered upon H3.3K27M expression. These genes will be tested using our melanoma model to identify downstream effectors of H3.3K27M oncogenicity. These studies will elucidate the function of PRC2 in melanoma, which has not been investigated."
"9211403","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Huntington's disease (HD) is an incurable autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease that is caused by an expansion of CAG triplet repeats in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. The expanded CAG repeats in the mutant HTT gene are translated into a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract that confers a deleterious gain of function on the mutant protein. The structurally altered mutant (m)HTT interacts with and inactivates critical factors; loss of function of these factors disrupts transcription of specific genes, synaptic function, calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial dynamics and energetics in HD. Additionally, accumulation of DNA damage and aberrant activation of DNA damage-response (DDR) ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) signaling is also implicated in the HD pathomechanism. Notwithstanding these discoveries defining the underlying disease mechanisms, the early instigating processes by which mHTT induces these pathological changes and drives functional decline and neuronal loss remain unknown. This knowledge gap is a major rate-limiting step in developing a targeted therapeutic strategy to prevent neurological decline in HD; due to this limitation this degenerative illness remains untreatable and invariably fatal. In an important step forward, we have discovered that the normal HTT recruits polynucleotide kinase 3' phosphatase (PNKP), a major DNA strand break repair enzyme; ataxin-3 (ATXN3), a deubiquitinating enzyme; and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) to form a transcription-dependent multi- protein DNA repair complex likely to be involved in the repair of actively transcribing genes. In contrast, mHTT disrupts the functional integrity of this repair complex and abrogates PNKP activity, resulting in DNA strand break accumulation to stimulate a pathogenic surge of DNA damage-response signaling in HD. The overall objective of this project is to characterize the molecular interactions by which mHTT impairs the enzymatic activities of PNKP and ATXN3, perturbs repair of the actively transcribed genes, and contributes to HD pathomechanism so that we can ultimately develop a preventive therapy for this terminal disease. These studies are designed to provide a mechanistic basis for neurodegeneration in HD and uncover the critical role of DNA repair therein. Aim 1 should confirm that mHTT alters the functional integrity of the transcription coupled repair complex, and inactivates PNKP to induce DNA strand breaks in the actively transcribing genes in HD. These studies should thus provide important insights into how polyQ expansion interferes with a specific DNA repair machinery to induce nuclear and mtDNA damage in HD. Aim 2 will provide critical mechanistic insights into how mHTT triggers pro-apoptotic stimuli to cause neurotoxicity in HD. Aim 3 will test the effectiveness of PNKP overexpression in the mutant cells and in HD transgenic mouse model in decreasing DNA lesions, preventing or slowing down DDR pathway activation in HD. These studies should confirm that mutant HTT-mediated impairment of neuronal DNA repair contributes to neurotoxicity in HD, and identify proximal molecular targets to develop mechanism-based therapeutic strategies for HD."
"9411990","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic phenomena refer to changes in gene expression inherited through cell divisions without changing the underlying DNA sequences. It is the epigenetic information marked by DNA methylation, histone modifications, non-coded RNA-mediated processing, etc., that direct cells with identical genomes to become distinct cell types throughout metazoan biology. Failure of this epigenetic regulation leads to abnormalities in stem cell behavior, which underlies diverse diseases including muscular dystrophy, diabetes, infertility, and many types of cancers. A central enigma in asymmetric stem cell division is how the epigenetic memory is retained to govern self-renewal of one daughter cell, while permitting differentiation of the other daughter cell. Recently, our lab has discovered that during the asymmetric cell division of Drosophila male germline stem cells (GSC), the preexisting histone 3 (H3) is selectively segregated to the GSCs, whereas newly synthesized H3 are enriched in the differentiating daughter cell. This asymmetric histone inheritance can provide the means for cells to impart distinct epigenetic information to the two daughter cells before their fates are determined. Employing a combination of molecular genetics and cell biology tools in both Drosophila and C. elegans as dual model systems with distinct advantages, this proposal aims to define (1) how the extrinsic signals emanating from the stem cell niche regulate intrinsic histone asymmetry of GSCs, (2) determine whether asymmetric histone inheritance is conserved, and (3) examine whether it is a broader mechanism used in asymmetric cell divisions in multiple lineages throughout development to maintain epigenetic memory. Applying the Drosophila male GSC model, studies have revealed that both intrinsic factors and extrinsic cues regulate GSC identity and activity. The extrinsic mechanisms include signals emanating from the niche, the extracellular matrix, and membrane bound molecules. Intriguingly, we have demonstrated that at least one of these extrinsic signals emanating from the niche are necessary to regulate asymmetric histone inheritance. We plan to further characterize these extrinsic pathways, which are in a unique position within the niche to integrate with intrinsic regulators of asymmetric histone inheritance. We will also exploit a C. elegans genetic model to address (1) whether asymmetric histone inheritance is a conserved mechanism across different species and (2) if this asymmetric histone inheritance specific for stem cells or a broader mechanism used in asymmetrically dividing cells to specify distinct cell fates. C. elegans is an ideal genetic model organism to study asymmetric histone inheritance with distinct experimental advantages to address both of these questions. The proposed study should uncover a fascinating element of epigenetic regulation during asymmetric cell division throughout development and generate a potentially transformative impact relevant to the fields of stem cell biology, epigenetics, regenerative medicine, genetics, and asymmetric cell division."
"9418174","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have one overarching goal: Train postdoctoral fellows who will be qualified and well-positioned to lead in the development, implementation, dissemination, and application of research-based tobacco control, public health, policy, and clinical practice. Specifically, we propose to continue support of a two- year postdoctoral fellowship that will attract individuals with a strong commitment to transdisciplinary research from a wide variety of backgrounds from medical, biological, social, behavioral, and policy sciences to help build the next generation of scientific leaders in tobacco control. Tobacco remains the leading preventable cause of death in the U.S. and it is responsible for 35% of all cancer deaths. The need for such experts continues to grow as science is needed to inform actions taken by the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco products, to address the rapid emergence of new tobacco products like electronic cigarettes, to guide the implementation of health care reform with an emphasis on disease prevention, and to influence the implementation of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, the first public health treaty negotiated under the auspices of the World Health Organization. Our program embodies the innovative cancer prevention training needed to give young scientists the tools to conduct and communicate transdisciplinary research by active involvement in multiple disciplines and translation of science to policy and clinical practice. We provide transdisciplinary coursework in tobacco science, health policy, biostatistics, tobacco policy, prevention and treatment of addiction and tobacco-related disease, combined with research directed by primary and secondary mentors from different disciplines. Fellows complete a course where they prepare and submit grant proposals to external funding agencies for their third year of fellowship. Research mentors include 33 faculty with active research programs from all four schools at UCSF (Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy and Dentistry). Mentors' research programs span tobacco control policy, the tobacco industry as a vector for cancer and other diseases, tobacco marketing, tobacco addiction and its prevention and treatment, health effects of smoking and secondhand smoke exposure, smokeless and emerging tobacco products, and smoking cessation. The wide variety in backgrounds and interests of fellows housed in the UCSF Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education provides a strong transdisciplinary environment that creates continuous opportunities to learn from colleagues working in other disciplines. Each fellow's individual development plan is created by the fellow, and reviewed by both mentors and the Fellowship Advisory Committee. The Committee also selects fellows from a competitive national pool: in the current funding period we had 159 applications for 25 positions. We have an outstanding track record of success: during the current funding period our fellows produced 120 papers in 69 different peer reviewed journals. Of the 29 postdoctoral fellows who have completed training, 26 (90%) have active scientific careers and 16 (55%) of graduates are academic faculty."
"9220414","Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) is an oncogenic transcription factor (TF) and a central immune checkpoint regulator. Tumorigenic and tolerogenic roles of STAT3 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other human cancers, as well as in the tumor-associated immune cells are well-defined and provide solid scientific premises for therapeutic STAT3 inhibition. To overcome the challenge imposed by lack of pharmacological inhibitors of STAT3, we recently developed a strategy for myeloid cell-selective STAT3 inhibition in vivo. Tethering to a synthetic Toll-like Receptor 9 (TLR9) agonists, CpG ODNs, allowed for targeted delivery of a STAT3 decoy oligodeoxynucleotide (STAT3dODN) into myeloid cells, such as AML cells and tumor-associated immune cells. Our preliminary studies demonstrated that intravenous injections of CpG-STAT3dODN lead to regression of disseminated human and mouse acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in murine models. In immunocompetent mice, STAT3-blocking/TLR9-stimulation triggered differentiation of leukemic cells to antigen-presenting cell (APC) phenotype rather than direct cytotoxicity. The immunogenicity of AML-APCs induced systemic CD8/CD4 T cell-mediated immunity and eliminated disseminated leukemia, including leukemic stem/progenitor cells, with no detectable toxicities to normal immune/hematopoietic stem cells. We propose to elucidate molecular/cellular mechanisms of CpG- STAT3dODN-induced AML immunogenicity and to characterize role of T cell-mediated immunity in AML rejection. Better understanding of the CpG-STAT3dODN effect on leukemia cell and T cell compartments will allow for the design of optimal combination of TLR9-targeted STAT3 inhibition with T cell-based therapies which will be validated within this proposal. These studies will accelerate development of novel, effective and safe nucleotide-based immunotherapeutic strategies for cell-selective targeting of STAT3 in AML and potentially other hematologic malignancies."
"9337065","ABSTRACT Genital tract infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonorrhea) does not induce a state of specific protective immunity and it can be acquired repeatedly. Despite public health measures, the disease persists at an unacceptably high frequency; there is no vaccine against it, and resistance even to the latest generations of antibiotics continues to emerge. Recent findings have revealed that N. gonorrhoeae subverts the immune system for its own benefit by eliciting innate responses that it can survive and by suppressing specific adaptive responses that would eliminate it. However, this induced immunosuppression can be reversed by treatments that effectively redirect the immune response against N. gonorrhoeae. Proof-of-principle has been established for a novel strategy of prophylaxis against genital gonococcal infection using a mouse model that is accepted as the only currently available animal model. The current vaccine prototype, GvaX12® (a combinatorial formulation of our proprietary sustained-release nanoparticulate interleukin-12 and gonococcal outer membrane vesicles) induces anti-gonococcal T-cell and antibody responses, and generates protection against homologous and heterologous strains for up to 6 months. In this Phase II application, we will define, optimize, and validate a vaccination regimen including route, aiming for intranasal administration. We will determine the basis of cross-protection against diverse strains of naturally occurring N. gonorrhoeae, and begin preliminary pharmacokinetics and toxicology studies in preparation for subsequent toxicological testing in nonhuman primates. Along with the preclinical data, toxicology results and future plans will be incorporated into a briefing package that will be submitted to the FDA in a request for a Type C Meeting."
"9422225","Since its inception the Yeast Resource Center has specialized in extracting information about protein  function from genome sequence.

We propose to develop technologies in four areas: 1) To identify  different protein variants or isoforms. 2) To quantify proteins by mass spectrometry with a focus on  determining absolute levels of a protein. 3) To study how protein variation affects protein function. 4) To  determine the structures of protein complexes not amenable to high-resolution methods such as x-ray  crystallography and NMR."
"9412027","DESCRIPTION:   Antibiotic resistance is an increasing problem in clinical settings and strains of bacteria that are resistant to multiple drugs are appearing with alarming frequency. While genetic changes have traditionally been studied as the source of drug resistance, bacteria can also evade antibiotics through transient, noisy expression of resistance mechanisms. Studies on transient resistance to date have focused on all-or-none tolerance mechanisms such as bacterial persistence where cells switch between a drug-tolerant and a drug-sensitive state. There is a fundamental gap in understanding of mechanisms that can generate a continuum of resistance levels within a population. This is a significant problem because bacteria can use such a strategy as a stepping stone to achieve higher, permanent levels of drug resistance. To address this, we will study an important regulatory protein, the multiple antibiotic resistance activator (MarA), which controls expression of many antibiotic resistance genes in clinically relevant pathogens. Our preliminary data show that expression of MarA is noisy in single cells, generating a continuum of expression levels within a population. These findings provoke the question of whether this noise leads to diversity in drug resistance, allowing populations of bacteria to hedge against the sudden appearance of an antibiotic. Our central hypothesis is that the regulatory circuit architecture controlling MarA amplifies noise, leading to variability in expression of resistance genes, and allowing a subset of cells to survive antibiotic treatment. We will test this hypothesis using an approach that integrates quantitative time-lapse microscopy and stochastic mathematical modeling to determine the mechanism and function of noise in MarA. The project is focused around three Aims: (1) Identify the genetic basis for phenotypic variability in MarA by comparing the regulatory network to alternative engineered networks. (2) Quantify how noise in MarA propagates to the diverse downstream antibiotic resistance genes it regulates. (3) Determine how variability in MarA impacts survival under time-varying antibiotic treatment. This integrative research is significant because it is expected to suggest treatment strategies for combating transient antibiotic resistance and will reveal important dynamic information about the period over which transient resistance develops and persists. Furthermore, it examines a novel mechanism for introducing diversity in antibiotic resistance gene expression, which is likely to be generally relevant to other mechanisms that generate transient antibiotic resistance."
"9224146","Project Summary/Abstract Candidate Background: In graduate school at the University of Virginia, I built on my undergraduate spectroscopy education by using spectroscopic tools to investigate membrane protein flexibility. As a Postdoctoral Fellow at Vanderbilt, I transitioned to membrane protein structural biology involved in human disease, specifically KCNQ and KCNE family-associated channelopathies. As a Postdoctoral Fellow, I have been involved in several projects concerning the structural underpinnings of disease mechanisms, most recently proposing a mechanism for diminished apical chloride secretion through an estrogen-induced loss of KCNQ1- KCNE3 channel conduction. Research Strategy: The human voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.5 (encoded by SCN5A) is implicated in several diseases of the heart including dilated cardiomyopathy, cardiac conduction disease, sick sinus syndrome, type 3 longQT syndrome, and Brugada syndrome. Several algorithms accurately predict SCN5A variants that are ultimately harmful (SIFT, PolyPhen-2, PredSNP, etc.). However, there is a significant gap in the negative predictive ability of these methods, i.e. the ability to accurately classify a variant as benign. The approach I am proposing is to tackle this problem on two fronts: 1) incorporating channel-specific, quantitative information-rich data into predictive model construction?the objective being to predict channel function, instead of disease- inducing propensity?and 2) including a set of point mutation variants enriched in WT/neutral phenotypes to improve discrimination power during model training and evaluation. This project aims to ultimately predict Nav1.5 channel phenotypes for all possible amino-acid changing single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNP) by balancing high-throughput computation and rigorous experimental validation with model systems: predicting the nearly 15,000 possible SCN5A missense nsSNPs is currently only feasible in silico, i.e. leveraging calculable channel-specific protein sequence and structure-based features. The availability of a high-throughput electrophysiology instrument allows for an unprecedented amassing of ion channel functional output from heterologously expressed Nav1.5; the evaluation of SCN5A variants impact on action potential in the more native like human induced pluripotent stem cell cardiomyocytes is possible in low-throughput. During the mentored (K99) phase of this award, I will generate (mis)trafficking and electrophysiology current output data from missense nsSNPs of SCN5A, focusing on the Voltage-Sensing Module (VSM) of domain IV (Aim 1) and train an SCN5A VSM IV-specific phenotype prediction model using trafficking and electrophysiology data from Aim 1 and the literature (Aim 2). As an independent investigator, I will determine structure and flexibility-induced changes from selected variants using a combination of Rosetta modeling and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to refine the predictive model (Aim 3). Career Development and Training: My training proposal is ambitious covering several disciplines, some of which will be new to me. The skills I will acquire are developing computational predictive models of ion channel phenotypes, trafficking/expression quantitation through Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS), CRISPR/Cas9 gene manipulation, and hiPSC cardiomyocyte production. Though there are many activities planned, I will be trained directly in the laboratories of prominent scientists in their respective fields: Charles Sanders, Jens Meiler, and Dan Roden."
"9363705","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mammalian Maf1 was initially identified as a transcriptional repressor of RNA polymerase III-transcribed genes and studies have focused on examining its role in repressing RNA pol III-dependent targets. Our work surprisingly revealed that Maf1 is also able to directly repress RNA pol II genes, although little is known regarding these specific gene targets. Furthermore, we have importantly identified a novel and conserved function for Maf1 in the maintenance of intracellular lipid pools in C. elegans, mice, and human cell culture. These results are the first to define a specific physiologic role for Maf1 in a multicellular organism. Maf1 negatively regulates lipid accumulation, in part, by repressing the expression of lipid biosynthesis genes. We hypothesize that Maf1 is a central node in the maintenance of organismal lipid homeostasis. Our proposed studies will define the mechanistic role of Maf1 in lipid metabolism in three aims. We will initially exploit our worm model system and use these findings to direct experiments in the mouse. This dual system approach will allow us to: (1) Define the physiological impact of Maf1 expression in maintaining lipid homeostasis by identifying which tissues are important for Maf1 function and identify cell autonomous and/or non-autonomous effects of Maf1 expression; (2) test how Maf1 regulates intracellular lipid homeostasis by the identification of evolutionarily conserved lipid pathway gene targets of Maf1, assess biochemically the impact of these genes on Maf1 lipid phenotypes, and examine the ability of Maf1 to override increases in intracellular lipids resulting from diet; (3) Identify how Maf1 activity is regulated to maintain intracellular lipid homeostasis. The results of these studie will reveal how Maf1 integrates into organismal control of lipid metabolism in vivo and identify the mechanisms that control this Maf1 function in lipid homeostasis. These studies will define an important new player in lipid metabolism and will be critical towards our future understanding of the role that Maf1 plays in human diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and cancer, which display prominent lipid dysregulation phenotypes."
"9402409","Project Summary  The recent advances in homogeneous nickel catalysis have showcased the ability of nickel to facilitate challenging transformations. Most reactions are performed using the temperature, air, and moisture unstable complex, Ni(COD)2 (COD = 1,5-cyclooctadiene). Do to the instability of this nickel catalyst, high-throughput experimentation (HTE) of nickel catalyzed reactions could not be performed. HTE is an important tool for rapid reaction optimization because many variables are screened and large quantities of data are collected for further understanding the reactivity. This proposal describes a strategy to perform HTE with Ni-catalysis to expedite the optimization of difficult chemical transformations necessary for drug development.  Recently, a new class of Ni(II)-precatalysts have been developed by Jamison, Yang, Percec, Buchwald, and Hartwig. The precatalysts offer many advantages over traditional nickel catalysts, such as Ni(COD)2, and other available precatalysts because of their moisture- and air-stability, ease of activation, and reduced catalyst loadings. However, because the ligands are preinstalled, the precatalysts cannot directly participate in HTE.  Continuous-flow chemistry has several notable advantages over traditional batch chemistry, including the ability to telescope syntheses and purifications. Due to the streamlining capabilities, developing a continuous- flow synthesis of the Ni(II)-precatalysts will enable their on-demand production. Furthermore, the flow synthesis could then be integrated into an HTE-system previously developed by the Jensen group.  The current Ni(II)-precatalysts are phosphine-based. NHC-based precatalysts exist, however, these precatalysts are not easily activated. Before designing a flow synthesis for NHC-based precatalyst, a new class similar to the phosphine-based precatalysts will be investigated.  Lastly, the value of the HTE system will be demonstrated through optimizing a novel reaction of high importance: Ni-photoredox catalyzed trifluoromethylation. Ni-catalyzed trifluoromethylations have not been realized due to the difficulty of nickel to form bonds between carbon and highly electronegative groups. However, Ni-photoredox utilizes a higher oxidation state, Ni(III), that has been shown to facilitate these difficult bond formations. Through leveraging Ni-photoredox catalysis and the developed HTE-system, new and efficient methods of trifluoromethylations will be developed."
"9217317","Abstract  This is an application for continuation of a project whose long-term goal is the identification of the mechanisms through which obesity and hypernutrition enhance cancer risk. Obesity manifests one of its strongest tumor-promoting effects in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the major primary liver cancer, whose US incidence has increased by 300% during the past 20 years. This increase is due to the obesity epidemic that is still spreading throughout our country. We therefore chose to address the important and general question regarding the mechanisms by which obesity increase cancer risk by studying the relationships between obesity and HCC development. In the previous project period, we developed new models for studying obesity-induced HCC and used them to establish the role of inflammation and ER stress in the progression of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) to HCC. During these studies, we had uncovered the key pathogenic function of the autophagy receptor and signaling adaptor p62/SQSTM1, a protein that accumulates in NASH and several other chronic liver diseases, all of which increase HCC risk. We have validated the relevance of p62/SQSTM1 to the pathogenesis of human HCC and shown that its elevated expression in the non-tumor liver provides a strong prediction of HCC recurrence after curative ablation. Since all of this work was done in collaboration with Dr. Jorge Moscat, a pioneer in studying p62 function, we have decided to formalize our joint effort and pursue a more in-depth investigation of p62 involvement in obesity-induced HCC through the multi-investigator R01 mechanism. We propose to further investigate how p62 exerts its HCC-inducing activity by defining the tumorigenic function of various p62 structural motifs that mediate its interactions with other proteins. In particular, we will focus on the role of NRF2, an activator of the anti-oxidant response, and mTORC1, a major metabolism regulating protein kinase complex, as downstream effectors of p62-dependent liver tumorigenesis. We will also conduct unbiased metabolomic analysis to decipher the role of NRF2- and mTORC1-regulated metabolic pathways in obesity-induced HCC development. In addition, we will use state-of-the-art high throughput screens to search for small molecule inhibitors that target p62-driven NRF2 and mTORC1 activation and thereby prevent obesity-induced HCC development or inhibit the growth and progression of such tumors. In addition to greatly improving our understanding of the mechanisms through which obesity induces HCC development, this investigation may lead to new preventive and therapeutic strategies."
"9409304","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cells found in solid tumors differ from healthy cells in a number of ways; notably cancerous cells often exhibit a loss of polarity and the resulting tumor tissues are highly disorganized. Tissue organization arises from precise control of the orientation of cell division which is mediated by microtubules and microtubule-associated proteins. The mitotic spindle, which originates at the nuclear position and is composed of microtubules, aligns perpendicular to the cleavage furrow to ensure proper segregation of cytoplasmic and nuclear materials. Asymmetric division results from asymmetric spatial distribution of cellular components prior to division. Despite the importance of mitotic spindle positioning in specifying the division plane, the mechanics and interactions that link cell polarit cues to the spindle position are unclear. The C. elegans zygote is an ideal model organism for studying the mechanics of spindle positioning because genetic and molecular techniques are well developed. In the single-celled embryo, the female and male pronuclei meet near the posterior and are translocate to the middle of the embryo while simultaneously rotating. Thus, the spindle axis aligns with the anterior/posterior polarity axis of the cell, giving rise to anteror and posterior specified fates after the first division. Studies of spindle orientation have assumed  that asymmetric localization of force generators induces torque for spindle rotation. However, mathematical modeling of known interactions between polarity proteins and microtubules results in centering of the nucleus but not rotation. Rotation depends on the microtubule plus-end motor protein dynein; however, dynein is located symmetrically throughout the embryo. Moreover, dynein regulators are localized either anteriorly or posteriorly, but with radial symmetry. Two mechanisms that are not mutually exclusive, might contribute to rotation. The first is that some protein affecting the pulling force of dynein on microtubules is radially asymmetric, leading to more force acting on one of the centrosomes. The second mechanism is that the centrosomes do not respond equally to the force from dynein. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that rotation can be explained by radially asymmetric cortical forces acting on the centrosomes coupled with a maturation-dependent difference in the way centrosomes respond to cortical forces. This hypothesis will be tested with three specific aims: 1) Generate mathematical models of the rotation event to test the two mechanisms of rotation. 2) Investigate the maturation-dependent differences between the two centrosomes. And 3) Using a candidate approach, uncover the radially asymmetric regulator(s) of dynein activity. This research is significant because it will lay the foundation for important questions in cancer and stem cell biology. Mathematical and physical modeling has contributed to our understanding of many biological processes. Models not only help to summarize key data, but also offer predictive power to generate novel hypotheses that can be tested in vivo."
"9247631","PROJECT SUMMARY . Mitochondria play a pivotal role in regulating cardiac function in health and disease by regulating energy balance, biosynthetic processes, and cellular survival. Mitochondrial quality control and homeostasis are maintained in part through fusion and fission of mitochondria as well as through autophagic clearance or mitophagy of damaged mitochondria. Disruption of mitochondrial homeostasis has been closely linked to a host of acquired and genetic disease states, characterized by cardiomyocyte death at the cell level and overt cardiac dysfunction at a systemic level. Thus, clearly a thorough understanding of the molecular regulators of mitochondrial homeostasis in the heart is critical for reducing cardiac dysfunction related mortality. Our preliminary data demonstrate that the mitochondrial E3 ubiquitin ligase, Mulan, is a novel regulator of mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy in mammalian hearts. Mulan participates in the maintenance of mitochondrial integrity and function. While Parkin, a cytoplasmic E3 ligase, has been extensively studied in mitophagy, Mulan's proposed role as a mitochondrial injury sensor, mediator of mitophagy, and inducer of cell death is both novel and a significant departure from the current state of understanding in the field. Given that Mulan is upregulated in Parkin null mouse hearts, we postulate that Mulan's upregulation may serve to compensate for the loss of Parkin, thus maintaining the basal cardiac function of Parkin null mice. Employing state-of-the-art techniques, we will investigate the intricacies of protein-protein and protein-substrate interactions by Mulan as well as how modulation of Mulan's expression fundamentally alters mitochondrial dynamics. Ultimately, our data may provide the first glimpse of an unrecognized, yet significant role of Mulan as a ?resident mitochondrial injury-sensor? in the heart. Furthermore, we intend to define the distinct contribution of Mulan in mitophagy, that is independent from Parkin, as well as Mulan's role in mitochondrial function, dynamics, and cell death in the heart. Given the emerging importance of mitochondrial dysfunction in cardiac pathology, the findings from our proposal will help define the role of Mulan as a key mitochondrial injury-sensor. In addition, the proposed studies will have broad implications for the understanding and treatment of heart disease."

"9330457","PROJECT SUMMARY The malaria parasite Plasmodium has to accomplish its sporogonic development in the mosquito vector in order for malaria transmission to occur. The long-term goal of the PI's research is to elucidate the interactions between the mosquito vector and malaria parasite to identify transmission-blocking targets suitable for the development of disease control strategies. During its journey through the mosquito, the parasite engages in intimate interactions with the mosquito midgut, hemolymph, and salivary gland and relies on numerous mosquito-derived host factors (agonists). Plasmodium can be impaired in the vector by agonist deletion through gene editing (GM mosquito population replacement), depletion through RNA interference (RNAi-based control through GM mosquito population replacement or external application of dsRNAs or analogues), or blocking/interference/inhibition through antibodies (transmission blocking vaccines) or small molecules (transmission blocking drugs or mosquito exposure). Hence, an obvious advantage of studying Plasmodium agonists for malaria control is that they can be targeted through multiple means. The recently developed CRISPR/CAS9-based gene editing in Anopheles mosquitoes provide new and promising opportunities for the study of agonist function through gene deletion, and for malaria control through gene drive. Here we will focus on 10 pro-Plasmodium factors (agonists) to assess their potential for malaria control and further our knowledge of their involvement in Plasmodium transmission. In Aim 1, we will validate 4 putative Plasmodium agonists (that have previously only been tested with non-human parasites) for P. falciparum transmission-blocking potential in A. gambiae using RNAi-mediated gene silencing. In Aim 2, we will develop CRISPR/CAS9- mediated gene KO mosquitoes for selected P. falciparum agonists. In Aim 3, we will assess these KO A. gambiae lines for resistance to P. falciparum infection and their fitness impact in terms of mosquito longevity and fecundity."
"9260717","Project Abstract  Sugar Alert is a 4-year study to assess the impact of the first-ever sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) warning labeling policy on knowledge, attitudes and consumption. SSB consumption is a major contributor to the twin epidemics of obesity and diabetes in America.1 Starting July 25 2016, the City of San Francisco will require prominent warning labels on most SSB advertisements: WARNING: Drinking beverages with added sugar(s) contributes to obesity, diabetes, and tooth decay. This is a message from the City and County of San Francisco.? Because San Francisco is the first jurisdiction to apply a warning label to SSBs, the proposed study offers an unprecedented opportunity to document if and how this approach could provide a viable tool for obesity prevention. Warning labels are a mainstay in evidence- based tobacco and alcohol policymaking. They have proven effective in changing attitudes, knowledge and the consumption of tobacco and to a lesser extent, alcohol, and therefore hold great promise for obesity prevention.  The proposed study will examine how consumers understand and react to warning labels on advertisements, whether this increases knowledge about the health harms of SSBs, promotes negative attitudes towards SSBs, or reduces SSB consumption. The effects of race/ethnicity, income, health consciousness and cognitive processing of the message will be assessed. We propose a pre-post quasi-experimental design with a representative telephone panel survey, including a pre-implementation baseline observation and follow-ups at 6, 12 and 24 months post-baseline. We will follow a representative sample of 1100 San Francisco adults and 1100 residents of San Jose as a control jurisdiction. Latinos and blacks, two ethnic groups with higher rates of SSB consumption, obesity and diabetes, will be oversampled to analyze whether warning labels disproportionately impact these vulnerable populations. Subjects will be screened for cross-contamination through travel. A complementary study component that documents all forms of advertising visible in both SF and SJ locations will assess compliance and advertiser responses to the warning label, validate whether implementation occurs as intended by lawmakers, and will detect shifts away from regulated advertising by advertisers seeking to circumvent the label effects. Specific Aims of the study are to: 1) Aim 1. Assess the exposure of San Francisco?s residents to the warning label message by documenting implementation over time. 2) Aim 2. Assess exposure to warning labels in SF (and SJ) adults over time, and whether exposure is associated with changes in knowledge, attitudes and behavior pertaining to SSBs and whether changes affect subpopulations differently, 3) Aim 3. Examine whether San Franciscans exposed to warning labels on SSB advertising report more pronounced reductions in daily calories consumed from SSBs compared to San Jose residents over time."
"9220663","Center PI: Malenka, Robert C. Principal Investigator (Project 4): Deisseroth, Karl/Malenka, Robert C.  Project Summary  Learning and memory must involve changes in neural circuit dynamics yet the mechanisms by which such  changes occur remain largely unknown. This project will use a novel in vivo imaging modality, termed fiber  photometry, which allows collection of activity patterns from genetically-targeted cells and processes in deep  brain structures in freely-moving animals. Using fiber photometry, real-time activity in CA3 pyramidal cell axon  projections and CA1 pyramidal cell bodies will be monitored during free behavior and while animals undergo  hippocampus-dependent learning and memory tasks. Genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) with  different fluorescent properties will be expressed in CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cells so that the relationship  between presynaptic activity in axonal projections and postsynaptic activity in their targets can be monitored  simultaneously, thus allowing quantification of the relationship between pre- and postsynaptic activity at a  defined set of synaptic connections. After validation of this novel method in anesthetized animals, it will be  applied to well-established hippocampal-dependent memory tasks including contextual fear conditioning and  one-trial avoidance learning with the goal of visualizing in awake behaving animals how CA3 to CA1 circuit  dynamics change as learning occurs. In a final series of experiments, which will be entirely based on the  results from the other three projects in the Conte Center, molecular interventions designed to modulate LTP or  homeostatic synaptic plasticity at CA3-CA1 synapses will be performed to determine their effects on  hippocampal circuit dynamics during learning and memory. Thus, this project has the potential to provide long-  sought insight into the neural circuit changes that underlie learning and memory as well as elucidate the role of  prominent forms of synaptic plasticity in these circuit adaptations.  Relevance  Learning and memory are due to long-lasting changes in specific circuits in the brain but it has not been  possible to observe these changes occur. Using a new sophisticated method that allows visualization of neural  circuit dynamics in behaving subjects, this project will define how a specific circuit changes during learning.  The information collected will provide important insight into how the brain encodes memory and how this  process can malfunction during brain disorders including mental illness."

Current strategies use social network (i.e. contact tracing and analyses of sex/drug use partner data to identify those at risk for infection), spatial (i.e. locate and characterize the social environment of ?hot spots), and phylogenetic (i.e. infer/characterize putative transmission links among HIV- infected persons based on viral sequence similarities) approaches. Combining these three strategies is rare, but could lead to a more comprehensive understanding of HIV transmission and the development of better targeted and multi-level intervention approaches to identify new HIV infections and prevent further transmission to others. Each approach has limitations when used alone, but they can complement and validate one another when used together. Social network data on recent sex/drug use partners provide insight into who is at risk for acquiring HIV based on the current network structure and existing relationships. Phylogenetic links are inferred between HIV-infected persons, typically constructed retrospectively using de-identified samples, and often not validated with data on sex/drug use partners. Without data on sex/drug use partners, two genetically similar viral sequences could be due to direct transmission, indirect transmission via a common source, or a series of intermediaries. Further, because phylogenetic links only include HIV-infected individuals, they provide limited information about who might be at risk for future infection. Thus, combining social network and phylogenetic links could uncover bridges between seemingly distinct networks. Finally, because individual risk behaviors are influenced by the people with whom they interact and the places they go to meet partners and/or engage in risk behaviors, analyzing social network and phylogenetic data together with spatial data can provide social context for these interactions. The specific aims are to (1) Combine social network and spatial data from HIV-infected individuals and their sex/drug use partners to identify novel combinations of network- and spatial/venue-based strategies to find new HIV infections and prevent further transmission; and (2) Overlay putative phylogenetic transmission ties with social network and spatial data and compare HIV intervention strategies identified in Aim1 with those identified with this combined approach. To achieve the Aims, newly diagnosed HIV infections (N=50) from Boston Medical Center (BMC) and their peer-referred drug/sex partners who are perceived to be HIV-negative (N=75) will complete a survey to collect demographic, behavioral, social network, and spatial data (Aim 1). HIV pol sequences from HIV-positive participants and 500 additional consenting BMC HIV patients will be obtained from routine drug resistance testing, used in phylogenetic analyses, and combined with Aim 1 social network and spatial data (Aim 2). These aims will identify priority intervention targets at each level and novel combinations which maximize coverage to those most at risk of HIV, without duplicating efforts."
"9300433","Summary/abstract: Tuberculosis (TB) is the number one infectious disease killer in the world with 1.5 million deaths attributable to the disease in 2014. A critical knowledge gap exists given the lack of biological pathways and predictive biomarkers related to TB onset, progression and resolution. An improved diagnostic test for TB would have a major impact on global control of the disease and reduce mortality. Unfortunately, there are no validated biomarkers for TB onset, progression and resolution; the development of a TB biomarker is urgently needed. Current ultra-high-resolution metabolomics (HRM) methods have considerable promise for the development of TB-associated biomarkers. Several studies have identified distinguishing small molecule metabolic profiles in blood and other bio samples in individuals with active Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)-induced TB disease compared to uninfected controls, but no studies have explored whether metabolomics is predictive of TB outcomes, Mtb clearance from sputum. Further, all studies to date have used low-resolution metabolomics methods. Advances in mass spectrometer machine capability, coupled with recent advanced data extraction/analysis methods has considerably increased the dynamic range of metabolite detection by HRM in biologic samples, which now exceeds 20,000 species (>100,000 ions). Our HRM processing scheme provides capability to detect very low abundance metabolites, including Mtb cell envelope glycolipids, and explore regulation of human metabolic pathways. In a pilot study, we successfully identified 61 plasma metabolites that differentiated adults with active pulmonary TB from household contacts without TB. Differentiating species included specific Mtb-derived cell wall glycolipids and endogenous lipid mediator resolvins. Our recent pilot data shows that specific metabolites and human metabolic pathways, including those involved in drug, amino acid, and lipid metabolism, are associated with the propensity for sputum Mtb culture clearance over time. The ultimate goal of this exploratory proposal is to obtain novel data that may lead to the development of new TB biomarkers. We hypothesize that plasma HRM analysis can: 1) predict the propensity for successful anti-TB treatment by identifying Mtb-derived and endogenous metabolites (biomarkers) and human metabolic pathways (pathophysiology) associated with sputum Mtb clearance; and 2) successfully differentiate patients with active TB from controls without latent TB infection (LTBI) or TB disease. To test these hypotheses, we propose the following Specific Aims in this exploratory R21 project: Specific Aim 1: To determine whether plasma HRM analysis can identify Mtb-derived and endogenous metabolites that predict clearance of Mtb from sputum (change from positive to negative culture). Specific Aim 2: To determine whether plasma HRM analysis can differentiate adults with drug- sensitive or MDR-TB ± HIV co-infection from asymptomatic controls without LTBI."
"9397593","Project Summary/Abstract  Proteome homeostasis (proteostasis) is essential for cellular life and is maintained by an array of cellular components that regulate the synthesis, folding, solubility and degradation of proteins throughout the proteome. Optimal cellular function is achieved when these proteostasis network (PN) components work collectively to calibrate the levels of correctly folded, and thus functional proteins, to meet cellular demands and prevent the formation of toxic protein aggregates. Many inherited forms of conformational diseases (CD), including many neurodegenerative diseases, are caused by gene mutations that result in non-native conformations (folding) of a single underlying protein, which increases the propensity of these proteins to aggregate. Cellular dysfunction in the context of the overexpression of these conformationally compromised aggregation-prone proteins has been linked to proteostasis impairment (PI). However, the timing and nature of the cellular events that lead to PI in CD remain elusive. A growing, but limited body of evidence suggests that a phenomenon termed chaperone titration (CT) is mechanistically linked to and may initiate PI in CD. Chaperones are essential PN components as they regulate the de novo folding or refolding of denatured client proteins, prevent, resolve or remodel client aggregates and target terminally misfolded or aggregated clients for degradation. The CT model posits that increasing preoccupation of chaperones with one ?compromised? client results in the titration of these chaperones away from their other clients leading to impaired folding and/or degradation of these clients. The goal of this proposal is to determine the extent and timing of CT in response to the accumulation of a conformationally compromised aggregation-prone protein. This goal was unattainable until now due to a previous lack of biochemical tools to globally assess multiple metrics of impaired chaperone maintenance and a lack of models in which the unfolding of a single protein could be induced with the acuteness and synchrony required to accurately test this model. To do this, the proposed studies will utilize a proteomics toolkit designed to detect changes in multiple protein metrics consistent with impaired chaperone maintenance and a novel cell model in which the unfolding and aggregation of a single protein (DD) can be induced with unprecedented acuteness and synchrony (within sec to min) in a cell population upon removal of a stabilizing ligand. In Aim 1, the proteome will be screened to identify the putative ?normal? clients of the chaperones that are titrated away by DD using this toolkit which measures alterations in protein ubiquitination, total levels, degradation rates and recruitment to DD aggregates. In Aim 2, these alterations will be validated using orthogonal biochemical analyses. In Aim 3, the extent of CT will be elucidated through experiments designed to definitively identify chaperones that are titrated away by DD and the ?normal? clients of these chaperones (putatively identified in Aims 1 and 2) affected by their titration. This research will advance our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of CD and the interconnectedness of chaperone-client networks."
"9390526","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The primary cellular defense system against protein misfolding and impaired clearance is the functional network of chaperone proteins, such as TRiC, which are both responsible for the proper folding of normal proteins and the attempt to refold or initiate destruction of damaged and genetically abnormal proteins. Compelling evidence from model systems supports the view that the proteostasis network can be modulated to improve the outcome of the cellular challenges presented by the toxic protein species responsible for neurodegenerative disease. However, to date, no effective therapeutic intervention for any neurodegenerative disease has been developed based on any principle including modulation of the chaperone network. This proposal is focused on carrying out an integrated program of investigation whose goal is to create a strong framework in which basic science understanding of the structure of toxic species and their interaction with the proteostasis  network is linked to translational approaches to reduce the accumulation of these species through reduced production and/or enhanced clearance. In so doing, the application addresses the critical societal goal of intercepting the oncoming epidemic of neurodegenerative disorders. We have chosen the paradigmatic neurodegenerative disease Huntington's disease and the TRiC chaperonin network as the focus of our program, based on strong data by our team that TRiC complex components provide clear beneficial effects on mutant HTT-induced phenotypes in model systems. In this Program Project we propose 3 integrated Projects and 2 supporting Cores to investigate mHTT-TRiC chaperonin interactions and determine how select TRiC related components contribute to or reduce mHTT-driven pathogenesis. The hypothesis that guides the proposal is that TRiC plays a critical role in regulating the accumulation of toxic form of the expanded repeat HTT protein and hence increasing the activity of TRiC and TRiC-derived proteins will abrogate and/or reverse mHTT-linked pathogenesis. We propose the following four overall Specific Aims: Aim 1: To characterize the interactions between TRiC reagents and aberrant forms of mHTT under in vitro and ex vivo conditions as well as in HD model cells and neurons. Aim 2: To investigate the impact of existing and novel TRiC reagents on the production and accumulation of mHTT species and cellular proteostasis. Aim 3: To systematically evaluate the impact of TRiC reagents on neuronal function and survival in cell culture. Aim 4: To systematically evaluate and compare the impact of TRiC reagent therapy in mouse models of HD through quantitative measures of neuronal structure, function and pathology. Our program will provide a framework for the extension of the study of TRiC based therapeutic strategies for other neurodegenerative disorders, including AD, PD, ALS or FTD. While our proposal will focus on TRiC-based therapeutics, our assays may point to the participation of chaperones that partner with TRiC in regulating mHTT effects and open the possibility of additional novel approaches to HD and related disorders."
"9398670","Project Summary  The ability of cells and organisms to maintain protein homeostasis is essential for sustaining viability and health. To ensure the proper folding, sorting and degradation of proteins, cells maintain a robust array of factors termed the proteostasis network. The accumulation of misfolding proteins and intracellular aggregates is a hallmark of a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Originally, this accumulation was thought to occur when protein misfolding outpaced the capacity of the proteostasis network and was considered to be a key feature of the pathologic mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases. Recent evidence suggests that the formation of intracellular aggregates is actually protective, sequestering potentially toxic misfolding proteins away from the cellular milieu. Evidence from yeast indicates that misfolding proteins are actively recognized by the proteostasis network and sequestered into distinct protein quality control compartments. Misfolding proteins, such as mutant Huntingtin, that form amyloid aggregates are directed to the insoluble protein deposit (IPOD) while non-amyloidogenic proteins, such as mutant SOD1, are transported to the juxtanuclear quality control compartment (JUNQ). However, the regulation of these pathways by the proteostasis network in mammalian cells remains poorly characterized.  Our objective is to elucidate the mechanisms by which the proteostasis network in mammalian cells regulates the formation of IPOD and JUNQ to selectively sequester amyloid and non-amyloid aggregates (Specific Aim 1). Moreover, we will identify specific subnetworks of proteostasis factors that directly interact with misfolding proteins to direct them either to IPOD or JUNQ (Specific Aim 2). Finally, we will investigate the impact of disease-associated proteins and stress signaling on the function of these proteostasis factors that influence JUNQ and IPOD formation and function (Specific Aim 3). The characterization of these pathways in mammalian cells will provide new insights into the regulation of protein aggregation as it pertains to neurodegenerative disease. Furthermore, this strategy will identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention in a variety of diseases associated with protein misfolding and aggregation."
"9315412","Project Summary/Abstract Immunomodulation through Nanocapsule-Mediated Cytosolic Delivery of siRNA  RNA interference is a potentially powerful strategy for immunotherapy. A key barrier to this approach is the inability to effectively deliver siRNA to the cytosol: with current strategies the vast majority of siRNA remains trapped in endosomes and is ineffective. Nanoparticle-stabilized capsules (NPSCs) deliver siRNA directly to the cytosol in a membrane fusion-like process, bypassing endocytosis. We have demonstrated effective knockdown both in vitro and in vivo in the spleen, with the latter requiring significantly lower dosing than current delivery strategies. In our proposed research we will use in vitro and in vivo experiments to optimize the immunomodulatory properties of these vehicles, focusing on reducing inflammatory response by targeting the cytokine TNF-?. Our proposed program features two Aims: Aim 1: We will fabricate and optimize therapeutic siRNA-based NPSCs, focusing on  maximizing cytosolar delivery efficiency, carrier capacity, and TNF-? knockdown  to macrophages while minimizing toxicity and non-specific immune response. Aim 2: We will determine the efficacy of our delivery system in lipopolysaccharide-  challenged mouse models of bacterial sepsis, via imaging and evaluation of anti-  inflammatory effects following siRNA-bearing NPSC treatment. The goal of this proposal is to demonstrate the utility of the NPSC platform for immunomodulation. We will build upon the highly efficient cytosolar delivery of siRNA observed in our preliminary NPSC results, evaluating and optimizing their in vivo behavior. These studies will provide critical insights to the translational potential of this vehicle, providing essential preliminary results for applications in specific immune disorders."
"9239127","PROJECT SUMMARY A novel function for REP family repetitive DNA elements encoded distal and proximal (<16 bp) to protein-coding regions in the E. coli K-12 genome has been recently discovered. These elements signal a partial, transient, and reversible translational stalling mediated through trans-translation resulting in a three-fold modulation of protein and mRNA levels. This work extended the cellular roles for the essential and universal trans-translation process to include gene regulation. This research proposal aims to broadly extend and confirm the initial report, potentially impacting many different areas of bacterial physiology due to (1) a large number and functional diversity of potentially regulated genes, (2) the experimental REP element legacy and a wide distribution of REP elements among both medically threatening and biome healing Enterobaceae, and (3) the likelihood that the signaling elements are not restricted only to REP-encoded RNA stem-loops. The complementary goals of this proposal are (1) to elucidate the biochemical pathways and signaling mechanisms involved experimentally in E. coli K-12 case studies, and (2) to apply bioinformatics to identify, functionally assess, and cluster genes that all have REPS and other RNA structures <16 bp after stop codons in common. Specific Aim 1 will determine the sequence requirements of mRNA stem-loops for the induction of trans-translation. Specific Aim 2 will examine the physiological significance and roles of REP hairpins, and the examination of physiological inducers, including the known UV induction in more detail. Specific Aim 3 will explore the mechanism of initiation of trans-translation by REPs. We will examine the roles of small mRNA interferases and rare stop codons in REP regulation. Specific Aim 4 will determine the distribution of predicted REP-arrested genes in the enteric bacteria and look for functional commonalities, especially their involvement in stress responses."

"9321544","Project Summary: The arenavirus Lassa (LASV) infects several hundred thousand individuals yearly in West Africa resulting in a high number of Lassa fever (LF) cases that are associated with high morbidity and mortality. In addition, LASV is a credible biodefense threat. There are not FDA-licensed vaccines and current anti-arenaviral therapy is limited to the off-label use of ribavirin that is only partially effective. The significance of LASV in human health and biodefense readiness, together with the limited existing armamentarium to combat them, underscore the unmet need for novel anti-LASV therapeutics. We hypothesize that selective targeting of host cell factors required for virus RNA replication and gene transcription, processes mediated by the virus ribonucleoprotein (vRNP), but dispensable for normal host cell metabolism and survival, represents a novel strategy to combat human pathogenic arenaviruses. This approach would minimize the common problem in antiviral therapy posed by the emergence of drug resistant variants. To implement this strategy, we propose to conduct a siRNA genome-wide screen to identify host cell genes required for the activity of LASV vRNP. For this we have generated a virus-free cell line containing a functional LASV vRNP (LASV/vRNP) that directs expression of the ZsGreen and Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) reporter genes (RG) from a virus-like RNA, aka minigenome (MG), and shown that RG expression (RGE) accurately reflect vRNP activity. Our specific aims (SA) are: SA 1. Conduct siRNA-based genome-wide screen to identify host cell factors that contribute to the activity of LASV vRNP. We have used our LASV/vRNP cells to establish conditions compatible with genetic HTS to identify modifiers of LASV vRNP activity. We propose to screen our LASV/vRNP cells against Dharmacon?s On-Target-Plus human genome library to identify host cell genes that inhibit LASV vRNP activity as reflected by reduction of Gluc and ZsGreen readings. SA 2. Hit validation. We will determine levels of LASV MG-directed expression levels of a different reporter gene, CAT, in cells where hit candidates have been subjected to RNAi-mediated knock down, complete loss- of-function via CRISPR-Cas9, and pharmacological interference. To assess hit specificity we will perform MG assays with other RNA viruses. Further hit validation will be done using cell types that are biologically relevant in the context of LASV including human epithelial and endothelia cells, hepatocytes and monocytes. Knowledge derived from these studies will provide: 1) the foundation for designing antiviral strategies aimed at targeting host cell factors required for essential viral RNA biosynthetic processes, and 2) novel insights about arenavirus-host interactions that will contribute to a better understanding of arenavirus pathogenesis."
"9413117","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  The mission of the UW/FHCRC CFAR Developmental Core is to create a generation of young, innovative, interdisciplinary HIV/AIDS researchers and to foster collaboration among UW/FHCRC CFAR investigators. This mission is articulated through three specific aims, the first of which is to provide research support and mentoring to junior investigators at institutions affiliated with the UW/FHCRC CFAR. Our New Investigator Awards (NIAs), which have successfully fostered the careers of 62 HIV/AIDS investigators since the program's beginning, will continue with modifications to prioritize applications in areas of importance to CFAR's Strategic Research priorities each year and further enhance mentorship through facilitated interawardee networking. Trainee Support Grants (TSGs) used to promote new collaborations will be continued. Additionally, the Core coordinates and collaborates with other CFAR Cores for more specialized developmental award programs, including International Pilot Awards (International Core) and HIV-Associated Malignancy Awards (AIDS-Associated Infections and Malignancies Core); and with OAR, IAS, two other CFARS, and NIH for the Creative and Novel Ideas in HIV Research (CNIHR) program. The second aim is to enhance career development, communication among investigators, and multidisciplinary research by sponsoring an annual UW/FHCRC CFAR Symposium. The third aim is to provide initial support for HIV/AIDS research in important new research areas (Emerging Opportunity Grants [EOGs]). Innovative aspects of this proposal include enhancing mentorship, a proposed collaboration with the International Core for a Mentored International Investigator Award (MHA), holding a Mock Study Section  (MSS) for NIA applicants to enhance grant-writing skills, holding a Junior Investigator Poster Session (JIPS)  at the annual Symposium, and improved methods for pre- and post-award tracking. The Developmental Core  will collaborate with all other CFAR cores and working groups, other CFARS, and research entities such as  the UW CTSA; and has specific policies, procedures, and measurable value-added indicators for each core  activity.  This Core's activities will provide value to the UW/FHCRC and national HIV/AIDS research communities by  fostering innovative, interdisciplinary, collaborative HIV/AIDS research now and in the future."
"9207770","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microbes can be social. In some groups of microbes that have parasitic lifecycles the social behavior of the many microbial cells can lead to the precise control of the animal they infect. The microbes orchestrate within the body and coordinate to form interactions that are as impressive as any other collective behavior from fish shoals to flocks of birds to ant trails. In some biological systems the manipulated animal is an ant and therefore belongs to its own collective, the colony. In our system we study the `zombie-ant' fungi (Ophiocordyceps) of tropical and temperate forests, which precisely control ants to leave their nest and bite into vegetation directly over the foraging trails of the colony. The function of such altered behavior becomes apparent when the fungus kills the ant and grows a stalk from its head that shoots out spores that infect other ants. The goal of this application is o develop models of such complex collective behavior by fungi controlling ants. We will develop computational and physical diffusion models of the development of the fungal collective, within its ant host. We will use high throughput Scanning Electron Microscopy of ant muscles and computer vision algorithms to develop 3D computational models and accurate networks of cells. We will perform micro-acoustic fluidic experiments to measure fungal behavior and develop physical diffusion models of the emergence of collective behavior. At the macroscopic scale we will measure infected ant behavior in the forest and build agent-based models to determine the rules explaining the effective targeting of ant trails by the fungal collective using the ant as a vehicle. Finally, we will perform experiments to understand the role of competition for the social behavior of microbes. This work is a collaboration among David Hughes, an expert of animal behavior and parasites, Ephraim Hanks, an expert on models of animal behavior, Danny Chen, a computer scientist expert in 3D models of cells, Francesco Costanzo, a theoretical mechanical expert in physical diffusion models and Tony Huang, an engineer expert in micro-acoustic fluidic experiments. Extensive collaboration already exists among the five researchers and four of the five occupy the same building at Penn State, ensuring an easy collaboration."
"9392508","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Virtually every cell in the body is exposed to mechanical forces that are transduced through its cytoskeleton and influence its activity. Recent studies using T cells, the master organizing cells of the adaptive immune system, have shown that mechanical forces acting upon the T cell receptor (TCR) and through the cytoskeleton can trigger cellular responses. It is unclear how the cytoskeleton plays this role, or how T cells interpret the interplay of forces and signals of receptor ligation. We have discovered that T cells are more sensitive to antigen (i.e., have a lower threshold of activation) when their actin cytoskeleton is untethered and mechanically soft. Furthermore, we have discovered that in autoimmune diabetes, mechanical forces from inflamed extracellular matrix (ECM) can provoke T cell autoimmunity. The gaps in our knowledge are due to a lack of tools that can measure and deliver nanoscale forces to live cells. That T cells encode their threshold of activation in cytoskeletal structures provides impetus to study how cells communicate in a language that combines mechanical forces with receptor signals. Here, we propose to 1) Determine the mechanosensitivity of the T cell receptor at the molecular level, using an advanced atomic force microscope (AFM) to convey mechanical forces and antigens to single-molecule TCRs; 2) Identify the cytoskeletal networks required for mechanosensing, using a new generation of AFM cantilevers that can measure cytoskeletal changes in live cells; and 3) Determine influence of mechanical forces due to inflammatory ECM, using a mouse model of autoimmune diabetes and a 3D biomimetic matrix to emulate the inflamed ECM and its mechanical effects on T cell activation. Our lab, working with our collaborators at Stanford, has pioneered breakthroughs in biological atomic force microscopy (AFM) and nanofabrication that make these innovative studies possible by allowing us to precisely ligate receptors and exert minute forces while measuring mechanical responses in live T cells, all while imaging cells and their cytoskeletal changes using live confocal microscopy. These studies will help us decipher the language of mechanical forces in cell signaling, and will have a major impact on our understanding of the mechanical effects of inflammatory ECM in autoimmune diseases. We expect our findings will spur novel immune therapeutics. Our new methods of using AFM in cell biology have the potential to revolutionize studies of mechanobiology and receptor signaling pathways implicated in many diseases."
"9418154","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The racial and ethnic diversity of the American population is not reflected in the biomedical research workforce or in the faculty at research universities and medical schools. Lack of intensive research experiences during their undergraduate studies leaves many underrepresented minority students unprepared to apply to highly competitive Ph.D. and MD-Ph.D. programs. The goal of this Post-Baccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) is to provide underrepresented minority students who want to pursue a career in biomedical research with the intensive research experience and academic enrichment to make them competitive applicants to rigorous Ph.D. and MD-Ph.D. programs. Einstein has a long history of successfully mentoring underrepresented minority students through both its Ph.D. and MD-Ph.D. programs. We will use a layered mentoring system to support the PREP trainees and integrate them into the Einstein community. Each trainee will have a URM Ph.D. and MD-Ph.D. peer mentor, a faculty Program Advisor and a research mentor. The program will begin with a two week Orientation and Boot Camp period. Trainees will work with their Program Advisor and research mentor to formulate an Individual Development Plan (IDP). The mentored research project will emphasize the process of hypothesis-based research, the excitement and joy of scientific discovery, and the persistence and creativity needed to achieve success. The academic component of the program will include: 1) workshops on study skills/time management and library/bibliographic search techniques, 2) a graduate course in Biomedical Research Methods and Analysis, 3) a month long Medical Correlation and 4) a weekly PREP journal club. The course will provide a conceptual understanding of the major experimental approaches used in modern biomedical research. The PREP Journal Club will teach critical reading of the literature. Throughout the program special emphasis will be placed on development of oral, written and poster communication skills through lectures, workshops and individual practice. Trainees will perfect their professional skill through Career & Professional Development workshops and perform videotaped mock interviews to improve their ability to communicate their strengths in the interview process for Ph.D. or MD-Ph.D. programs. In collaboration with the Hispanic Center of Excellence, trainees will be involved in community outreach through visits to local Bronx high schools with a high percentage of URM students. This combination of didactic and experiential learning will prepare the applicants to apply successfully to highly competitive Ph.D. and MD-Ph.D. programs. We expect that more than 75% of the trainees will matriculate and successfully complete such programs. This will expand the diversity of our own graduate programs and ultimately the faculty at Einstein and beyond."
"9241140","Project Summary Non-invasive neuroimaging procedures have provided instrumental insights into our understanding of how chronic exposure to ethanol can affect brain structure and function. Through comparisons of brain macroscopic structure in alcoholics and age-matched controls, it has been possible to detect changes in brain tissue volume, and its recovery following abstinence from alcohol. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) experiments have provided information on cellular-level changes in white matter microstructure that result from chronic exposure to ethanol, often prior to the appearance of macroscopic changes. In addition to these structural changes, it has also been possible to characterize physiological changes associated with brain function in functional MRI experiments. However, in all of these neuroimaging approaches, consistent systematic confounding factors plague the biological interpretations of findings. First, it is not possible to accurately quantify ethanol exposure, beginning at the initiation of drinking, in human subjects. Second, confounding factors such as polydrug use, nutrition, frequency of withdrawals, and other environmental insults are difficult to discern from the effects of ethanol exposure on brain structure and function. Third, the interpretation of functional neuroimaging experiments can be difficult to cast in terms of neural function, e.g., as measured using traditional neurophysiological methods. In order to address these deficits in knowledge, we propose a Translational Neuroimaging Core to perform MRI experiments on nonhuman primate research subjects at the Oregon National Primate Research Center's nonhuman-primate-dedicated MRI facility. These experiments have been designed to directly support projects in the INIA-S as well as the INIA-N consortia. Aim 1 is to provide data to buttress INIA-S project 8, in which glucocorticoid antagonists will be administered to nonhuman primate research subjects, and the resting-state functional MRI changes associated with the resulting changes in drinking patterns will be determined. Aim 2 is to support an INIA-N project proposed by A. Pfefferbaum, E. Sullivan, and N. Zahr, in which brain structural and functional changes associated with repeated episodes of abstinence and drinking will be determined in rhesus macaques to bridge data acquired in rodent and human species. Aim 3 is to support INIA-S project 7, to use functional MRI to directly monitor changes in brain circuitry induced through the influence of designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) in the striatum, and to characterize the effects of DREADDs-induced neural activity changes on functional connectivity measurements. Last, in a subset of control animals, quantitative comparisons will be performed between MRI-determined functional connectivity and connectivity assessed with focal infrared neural stimulation of regions known to be sensitive to previous exposure to ethanol, with the goal of assessing the validity of common interpretations of resting-state fMRI experiments."
"9223244","PROJECT SUMMARY In the US, roughly one in five children experiences a mental health problem severe enough to warrant diagnosis and intervention. The education sector offers compelling opportunities to improve service access, but school mental health (SMH) providers are unlikely to deliver high-quality evidence-based practices (EBP), dramatically reducing the public health impact of these services. Multiple barriers interfere with SMH providers receiving adequate training and support in EBP, including limited time and scarce training resources. The goal of this project is to improve school-based care by developing and testing an online training and consultation system to facilitate use of routine outcome monitoring (ROM), an EBP with extensive empirical support and a feasible and cost-effective minimal intervention necessary for change. Although ROM is not routinely used by SMH providers, our preliminary work has found that targeted training can improve ROM uptake. Unfortunately, due to issues such as time, training resources, and practitioner geographic dispersion, especially in rural areas (<1 practitioner per school), ROM training is inaccessible to many SMH providers. Online training (OLT) addresses these barriers. In addition, because OLT is self-paced and flexible, it is associated with lower levels of provider burnout. OLT is also cost effective and scalable because its only requirements are internet access and server support. Regardless of the training modality, post-training consultation is essential for practitioner behavior change. To be optimally effective, consultation needs to be collaborative and responsive to learner needs. Using user-centered design methodology, which emphasizes iterative development of parsimonious and compelling products, the current R34 proposal will maximize the feasibility, usability, and efficiency of an innovative approach to OLT and follow-up consultation for SMH clinicians ? Brief Online Training (BOLT) for ROM. In Aim 1, we will develop the OLT platform via iterative prototyping and continuous user testing to optimize system usability and training's impact on provider knowledge and attitudes about ROM. In Aim 2, we will iteratively develop BOLT post-training consultation procedures to optimize putative mechanisms of effective consultation: consultant collaboration & responsiveness. In Aim 3, we will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial of the full BOLT training/consultation package to test (1) BOLT effects on ROM knowledge, attitudes, and weekly assessments of ROM use; (2) the incremental impact of consultation dosage on ROM use; and (3) mechanisms of BOLT impact, including (a) platform usability, (b) clinician knowledge and attitude gains, (c) collaboration, and (d) responsiveness of consultation. This project will yield feasibility data to inform a subsequent effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial that will experimentally test BOLT mechanisms of change and its impact on youth outcomes."
"9311085","Abstract Klebsiella pneumoniae is a leading cause of hospital-acquired infections in the United States and the most common Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and Extended-Spectrum Beta-lactamase (ESBL) species. Infections with CRE cause up to 50% mortality from sepsis, and both ESBL and CRE infections are a significant cause of excess morbidity and hospital costs. Our preliminary data from 1765 patients indicates that patients with K. pneumoniae gastrointestinal colonization are at a high risk of subsequent disease (Odds ratio 4.0; p<0.0001) and become infected with their colonizing strain. Antibiotic therapy can be life-saving but choosing the correct regimen requires antimicrobial susceptibility data that is available days after the onset of disease. Testing for colonization could provide an ideal opportunity for intervention: physicians can identify at- risk patients and use antibiotic susceptibility data from their colonizing strain to make rational choices for empiric therapy. High-risk patients could be targeted for intervention, but how the complex interaction of patient and bacterial factors leads to disease is unknown. To close this gap in knowledge, we have assembled a multi- disciplinary team of physician-scientists, epidemiologists, bioinformaticians, and statisticians with expertise in clinical microbiology, microbial pathogenesis and infectious diseases. The objective of this proposal is to identify the bacterial and host factors that predict K. pneumoniae infections in colonized patients. Our central hypothesis is that K. pneumoniae strains vary in their virulence potential, and the combination of K. pneumoniae genotype and host susceptibility determines the risk of disease in a colonized patient. To test this hypothesis, we validated a novel genome comparison method called Pathogenicity-Associated Loci sequencing (PAL-Seq) to identify K. pneumoniae genes in variable genomic regions that are associated with infection. We also developed a preliminary clinical model of patient risk factors for K. pneumoniae infection. We will test our hypothesis and meet the objective of this proposal through the following specific aims: Aim 1: Define patient risk factors for K. pneumoniae infection in colonized patients. We will use electronic medical records and culture samples in cohorts from three hospitals to build and validate models based on patient characteristics and colonization density as risk factors for infection in colonized patients, and test the models in the subgroup of ESBL and CRE colonized patients. Aim 2: Identify K. pneumoniae genes that predict the risk of disease in colonized patients. Using colonizing and invasive isolates, we will apply our PAL-Seq pipeline to identify bacterial genes associated with infection, validate them in animal models and an independent cohort, and test candidate virulence genes in ESBL and CRE colonized patients. The positive impact of this work will be immediate and substantial. We will rapidly advance our understanding of K. pneumoniae pathogenesis based on both clinical and animal studies, and develop predictive models that could be used to identify high- risk patients for prevention or rapid treatment of K. pneumoniae infection."

"9233213","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Huntington's disease: a novel developmental oligodendrogliopathy Huntington's disease (HD) is a relentlessly progressive neurodegenerative disorder that typically presents with progressive cognitive/motor deficits. Although HD exhibits a unitary genetic basis (mutant huntingtin [mHtt]), our understanding of HD pathogenesis remains poorly defined. The hallmark of HD is degeneration of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs). Therefore, study of HD has focused predominantly on cell autonomous mechanisms mediating MSN death. However, there is increasing recognition that HD pathology also encompasses dysfunction of oligodendrocytes (OLs), myelin and white matter tracts (WMTs). These defects occur during prodromal phases of HD, suggesting that non-cell autonomous mechanisms mediated by OLs may play important roles in HD pathogenesis. Here, we test the hypothesis that postnatal WMT abnormalities are: (1) secondary to defects in the second wave of developmental forebrain oligodendrogliogenesis leading to ectopic persistence of non-myelinating OLs from the first wave, and (2) necessary for region-specific profiles of forebrain vulnerability to neurodegeneration. This developmental hypothesis is based on our experimental data showing: (1) impairments in multiple NSC-mediated MSN developmental parameters in a HD knock-in mouse model, (2) early and stable OL impairments in HD mouse models/human pathological specimens, (3) key conjoint roles of Gsx2 in mediating MSN and OL second wave developmental functions, and (4) selective temporal ablation of mHtt after neural development recapitulates characteristic features of HD (EUREKA R01). Our Specific Aims are to define: (1) roles of ventrally- vs. dorsally-derived developmental OLs in HD WMT abnormalities, (2) pathogenic roles of OLs and WMT abnormalities in HD pathogenesis and therapeutic benefits of OL-based molecular genetic and cell replacement interventions. Our research approach will study: (I) differential ontogenic expression of Gsx2 in HD, (II) dynamic OL-specific lineage aberrations in HD, (III) molecular genetic rescue of Gsx2-dependent OL deficits in HD, (IV) role of HD-associated OL abnormalities in HD pathogenesis via conditional ablation of mHtt in OL precursors, (V) effects on HD onset/progression of OL cell replacement strategies. The Significance includes: (A) defining the developmental nature of HD OL lineage abnormalities, (B) establishing that a non-neuronal/non-cell autonomous mechanism is part of the pathogenic cascade leading to neuronal cell death, (C) establishing that HD represents a new class of primary developmental oligodendrogliopathy, (D) initiating entirely new directions for gene and cell based therapeutic studies during the prodromal phase based upon the HD-mediated OL developmental dysfunction. The Innovation is (1) proposing a novel mechanism underlying HD pathogenesis by incorporating a two-hit model including developmental forebrain OL deficits, (2) employing OL lineage-tracing to study the HD developmental oligodendrogliopathy, (3) using time-specific conditional genetic manipulations to rescue the putative HD developmental oligodendrogliopathy, (4) using cell replacement of OL developmental species to treat HD."

"9145157","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since 1974, lung cancer has caused more deaths each year in the US than breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer combined. The burden of lung cancer mortality is especially high for Blacks who are even more likely than Whites to be diagnosed at the most advanced stages of the disease. For the first time, screening for lung cancer through computed tomography (CT) has been shown to reduce lung cancer mortality. The recently completed National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) concluded CT screening reduced lung cancer mortality by 20%, compared to screening with chest X-ray. CT screening in NLST reduced lung cancer mortality as much-and possibly more-for Blacks than for Whites (38% versus 14% reduction). While promising, we do not yet know if the efficacy of CT screening demonstrated in NLST will translate to effective reductions in lung cancer mortality as CT screening has now begun to occur in community practice. We also do not yet know if the benefits of CT screening will be shared equally between Black and White patients. Often the benefits demonstrated in randomized trials far exceed the benefits realized in the community. CT screening may provide less benefit to patients in the community than it did for NLST participants because of barriers to screening (e.g., low knowledge about screening and its risks) and treatment-related complications (e.g., high rates of post-operative mortality for lung cancer surgery). Moreover, if these screening barriers and treatment- related complications are higher among Blacks than Whites-as they are for other leading cancers-racial disparities in lung cancer mortality may actually widen over time. In this study, we will use data from NLST, nationally representative health survey data, and Medicare administrative claims data to address the following specific aims. First, we will generalize the findings of NLST to the US population of cigarette smokers. Second, we will assess the structural and clinical barriers facing cigarette smokers to receiving and benefiting from CT screening for lung cancer. Third, we will estimate the number of lung cancer deaths in the US that could be averted by CT screening assuming race-specific rates of CT screening and varying the effectiveness of CT screening to reduce lung cancer mortality. This project will help to improve clinical practice and narrow future racial disparities in lung cancer mortality by revealing the structural and clinical barriers that impede equally effective translation of CT screening. This project will also improve shared decision making between patients and their healthcare providers as they discuss lung cancer screening by providing the most up-to-date estimates of screening benefits and harms in everyday practice. Thus, this project will directly address key research objectives of PA-13-288. Finally, this project will inform preparation of an NCI R01 grant to assess contemporary CT screening rates in pre-Medicare and Medicare aged populations and determine if and how actual screening patterns affect disparities in stage at diagnosis, survival and lung cancer mortality at the population level."
"9208530","ABSTRACT Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are the most commonly encountered birth defect, affecting as many as 8 in 1,000 live births. In many cases, life-saving surgical intervention is required. Despite the prevalence, in many cases the underlying molecular etiology of CHDs is not known. The central theme of this Program Project Grant application is to elucidate mechanisms that regulate growth and morphogenesis of the ventricle during development. Our objective is to gain understanding of how early events impacting mesoderm-lineage specification and differentiation, how mid-gestational events impacting septation and papillary muscle formation, and how late-gestational events impacting cardiomyocyte polarity and sarcomere maturation each contribute to normal ventricular morphogenesis. Three highly interactive and complementary Projects are proposed to attain these objectives. Project 1 will study the molecular mechanisms contributing to the genesis of CHDs in an animal model of X-linked heterotaxy. These studies build on work from Dr. Stephanie Ware's laboratory and will test the overall hypothesis that morphogenic defects in early embryonic structures can impact the migration and differentiation of primitive progenitor cells which subsequently give rise to the myocardium. Such a mechanism would explain why the spectrum of CHDs encountered in heterotaxia patients is more severe than what would be anticipated to result from altered sidedness. Project 2 will study the molecular mechanisms regulating ventricular septation and papillary muscle formation. These studies build on work from Dr. Anthony Firulli's laboratory and will test the overall hypothesis that expression cardiomyogenic transcription factors imparts morphogenic cues directing normal cardiomyocyte patterning in the developing left ventricle, and that mid-gestational alteration of this patterning gives rise to CHD. Such a mechanism would establish cell and molecular pathways which regulate normal and abnormal development of the ventricular septation and papillary muscle. Project 3 will study the molecular mechanisms regulating compaction of the left ventricle during cardiac development. These studies build on work from Dr. Weinian Shou's laboratory and will test the overall hypothesis that altered cardiomyocyte cell polarity gives rise to ventricular noncompaction, and furthermore, will dissect the molecular regulatory cascades which are required to establish normal cardiomyocyte polarity. Such a mechanism would establish a common underlying molecular etiology which gives rise to left ventricular noncompaction. The proposed work will be facilitated by the participation of three cores (Administration, Cardiac Imaging and Mouse Resources). Ultimately, the studies proposed in this Program Project Grant application will illustrate how events occurring prior to overt heart formation, during early cardiac development, and during late maturation of the ventricular wall are sequentially integrated for normal cardiac morphogenesis. Importantly, defining the molecular regulation of these events will provide insight into potential interventions aiming to mitigate the deleterious impact of CHD."
"9286602","PROJECT SUMMARY The frontal-basal ganglia network supports our ability to update action plans based on reward feedback. A prevailing theory posits that stress perturbs frontal cortical function, thereby impairing motivated behavior. Although this theory is supported by morphological and molecular evidence, data detailing the maladaptive changes in neural activity in vivo are lacking. One challenge is heterogeneity, because frontal cortical neurons exhibit diverse task-related activity patterns. To overcome this challenge, we developed experimental approaches to record from an ensemble of neurons as mice perform an instrumental sucrose preference task. Our preliminary results showed that layer 2/3 medial frontal cortical neurons display distinct activity patterns associated with the timing and initiation of voluntary actions. These results led us to propose two hypotheses for how chronic stress may impair the cortical circuitry for voluntary actions. One, chronic stress diminishes the activity of cells involved in action initiation. Two, frontal corticostriatal neurons send command-like signal in service of action initiation. To test these hypotheses, we propose two specific aims. In Aim 1, we will investigate the longitudinal effects of chronic stress on frontal cortical ensemble activity. We will use a computational model to gain insights into how the neural activity modifications can alter instrumental behavior. In Aim 2, we will record from corticostriatal neurons during the instrumental task. Using optogenetics and targeted ablation, we will test their potential causal roles in mediating purposive actions. Accomplishing these aims will provide circuit-level insights into the neural basis of voluntary behavior. Framework of chronic stress that includes the complexity of neural dynamics will allow a better understanding of depressive-like behaviors."
"9296592","7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In this Exploratory/Developmental project we test the idea that changes in the gut microbiota, by regulating host immune cells, can influence periprosthetic joint infection. Although incidence of periprosthetic joint infection is less than 1%, infection is the number one cause of revision total knee arthroplasty and the third leading cause of revision total hip arthroplasty. Existing treatments for periprosthetic joint infection are expensive in terms of cost and patient morbidity and have low success rates, suggesting the need for improved methods of preventing infection. One factor recently associated with infection is the patient microbiome. Alterations in the gut microbiome have been observed in almost all clinical conditions identified as risk factors for periprosthetic joint infection (diabetes, malnutrition, obesity, etc.). The gut microbiome is a key mediator of the host immune system. Patients with impaired gut microbiota are at greater risk for infection following stem cell transplantation and animal models suggest that a history of a healthy microbiome improves resistance to systemic infection. Our hypothesis is that altered gut microbiota reduce immune cell populations and thereby facilitate the development of periprosthetic joint infection. The project has one aim: Determine the severity of periprosthetic infection in mice with altered gut microbiota. In this project we combine a novel murine model of periprosthetic joint infection with manipulation of the gut microbiota. We consider four conditions of the gut microbiome: 1) normal microbiome; 2) altered microbiome due to genetic background; 3) altered microbiome due to history of antibiotic treatment; and 4) a history of no microbiome (germ-free). We then determine the severity of implant infection, the contents of the gut microbiota and the associated changes in immune cell populations. If our hypothesis is correct it will suggest that the gut microbiome is a modifiable risk factor for periprosthetic joint infection, and that treatments reconstitution of a healthy gut microbiota prior to total joint arthroplasty could further risk the risk of infection."
"9255556","A Signalling Logic Underlying Polypharmacology: Abstract  The promiscuity of several?if not most?drugs have irked medicinal chemists. The off-target effects are undesired although a lack of specificity is not always detrimental, rather an improved therapeutic response is sometimes observed. The targets involved are often unrelated by sequence and by family, but can be unified by ligand similarity.  The Similarity Ensemble Approach (SEA) has been effective in discovering the ligand-based protein- protein relationships. Moreover, the findings have successfully rationalized unexplained side effects and prospectively been used to re-appropriate drugs. Here SEA will be used to identify targets that share similar ligands and share an endogenous signalling molecule with the goal of providing a guide for polypharmacology.  The motivating idea behind this proposal is that receptors have evolved around a glossary of hormones and neurotransmitters (estrogen, serotonin, dopamine, etc.). Organic signalling molecules quickly become fixed due to their numerous constraints and functional dependencies, whereas genetically encoded proteins evolve around them, develop recognition sites for them, and emerge as targets of the drugs that mimic them. This study seeks to demonstrate that molecular evolution underlies polypharmacology?an idea from which new signalling molecules can be deduced and effective multi-target drugs can be designed.  This proposal claims that 1. there exists a metabolic code that inverts our thinking of biological organization?suggesting that proteins have evolved around organic signalling molecules. Consequently, 2. proteins can be arranged according to ligand similarity. The new organization can be used to 3. predict unknown signalling molecules, 4. associate sequence-unrelated proteins by their shared signalling molecule, and 5. identify synthetic molecules that can modulate these target-pairs to produce synergistic cellular effects.  The assertions will be tested with a combination of chemoinformatics and experimental techniques. SEA will predict targets for neurotransmitters and hormones and predict target pairs related by similar ligand sets. Dendrograms?akin to kinome trees?will be built for each protein family, ordered by ligand similarity. With the new target-target associations, synthetic co-modulators will be tested for polypharmacology on target pairs that share an endogenous signalling molecule."
"9241613","Pediatric cardiovascular disorders, which comprise congenital heart defects (CHD) and myocardial and conduction system diseases, remain highly challenging due to cardiac co-morbidities and premature mortality. As most of these disorders are genetic, efforts over the past 30 years have focused on identifying their causal mutations. Particularly for Mendelian traits such as Noonan syndrome and related disorders (the RASopathies), this has been highly successful. Newer genomic technologies have accelerated gene discovery for pediatric cardiovascular disorders, including genetically complex ones. These genetic discoveries are improving care through more accurate diagnosis, better prognostication, and refinement of clinical trial design. What has not occurred with rare exception is the development of novel therapies based on the new understanding of disease pathogenesis enabled by these gene discoveries. Finding therapies for pediatric cardiovascular disorders will be challenging because the biological targets are generally central to cell homeostasis (e.g., RAS/MAP kinase signaling) so cannot be completely inhibited for long periods without incurring side effects that would outweigh their benefits. For this R35 mechanism, I and my outstanding co- investigators with relevant expertise intend to address this gap using a drug development pipeline that begins with high-throughput screening to overcome pupal lethality in Drosophila melanogaster models of disease with a chemical library that covers druggable space (n=14,400) using 96-well plates and robotics. Screening in whole animals is performed agnostically and has the putative advantage of providing a simultaneous read out of efficacy and toxicity. We provide preliminary data showing that we have already achieved this using a fly RAF1 mutant model of Noonan syndrome with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Subsequent steps with fruit flies include confirmation of initial hits in vials, determining efficacy against adult fly phenotypes such as rough eye, ectopic wing veins and heart hypertrophy. Back-up libraries for the candidate compounds, typically 60-80 chemical neighbors, will be culled for ones with most desirable drug traits and then screened in the fly models. Using a defined set of fruit fly deficiency lines, targets and anti-targets will be established to enable further rounds of rational pharmacology. ADME studies will be used to reduce potential for drug-drug interactions. In parallel, we will pursue repurposing of FDA-approved drugs using library screening with fruit fly models and systems pharmacogenomics. Leading compounds and drugs will then be tested against phenotypes in human induced pluripotent stem cell lines with the disease-causing mutation for efficacy. The most promising drugs will then be tested in existing mouse models (e.g., HCM in Raf1 mutant mice) using appropriate endpoints. Taken as a whole, the approach proposed will significantly advance the identification of novel therapeutics for pediatric cardiovascular diseases, starting with the RASopathies and later for other traits. If robust, this will provide a paradigm that can be adopted for other genetic traits of interest to the NHLBI."
"9347344","Project Summary Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global burden that kills 1.5 million people every year. TB mostly affects developing countries, but the rise of multi-drug and extensively drug resistant strains is a global threat. In order to control and eradicate this disease, it is imperative to have adequate tools to detect active TB in limited-resource settings and point-of-care (POC) settings, which is where most TB patients are seen. However, available detection methods have poor performance and are not suited for diagnosis in limited-resource or POC settings. The most commonly used method to detect TB is smear microscopy, a procedure developed more than 100 years ago that only detects 50% of the cases. In Phase I, we developed a sample preparation and detection procedure that is rapid, robust, easy to automate, and highly sensitive and specific. The new assay is based on Single Molecule Scanning (SMS), a novel technology capable of detecting single molecules using simple equipment. Here, we will develop a fully automated next generation molecular test based on the feasibility of SMS stablished in Phase I. The goal is to replace smear-microscopy for sputum- based diagnosis of TB in high TB-burden countries and to replace PCR-based TB diagnosis in developed countries. If successful, the new assay will be more accurate than the current leader molecular assay (>95% sensitivity, >99% specificity) and its price will be affordable for limited- resource settings ($6/test, $1,200/instrument). In addition, the new assay will satisfy all the characteristics that according to a WHO report are required in a product to replace smear microscopy. The overall goal of Phase II, is to develop and to validate a disposable cartridge and a fully automated instrument for TB testing. Aim 1 focuses on the development of the disposable cartridge, Aim 2 on the development of the portable instrument and Aim 3 on the verification and clinical validation of the final instrument and cartridge design. This evaluation together with the design documentation accumulated during the project will be combined with additional clinical evaluations to obtain CE mark, FDA approval, approval in high TB-burden countries, and the endorsement of the World Health Organization."
"9235701","Physical inactivity is a growing health problem in the United States, especially for older people with chronic diseases such as COPD; in fact people with COPD are among the least active. Low levels of PA are associated with negative health outcomes including an increase in mortality and COPD exacerbations. Current PA guidelines focus on moderate-to-vigorous physical activities (MVPAs) that are too strenuous and not feasible for long term maintenance in many people with COPD. We propose a new paradigm for promoting physical activity (PA) in this population; focus on increasing time spent in light physical activity (LPA) and decreasing time spent in sedentary behavior. Growing evidence suggests that substantial health benefits are associated with increases in the volume of LPA. We propose to test the efficacy of our Active-for-Life (Active- Life) intervention and to quantify the mediating effects of potential mechanisms responsible for therapeutic outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that Active-Life will have positive effects on objectively measured PA. Active-Life is a 10 week intervention designed to increase total PA with an emphasis on increasing the time spent in LPA and decreasing sedentary time. Key components of Active-Life include (a) exercise with functional circuit training (FCT), walking and stretching in a laboratory-based exercise program that can easily be transitioned to the home setting with minimal equipment, (b) a behavioral component with a structured self- efficacy enhancing intervention that includes self-regulations strategies, (c) education that addresses the distinct health benefits of LPA and MVPA, the negative consequences of too much sedentary time, and an action plan for dealing with acute exacerbations of COPD and (d) follow-up with phone coaching and booster sessions. Active-Life establishes a goal for subjects, to increase total PA, combined LPA and MVPA, at least 60 minutes a day. This far exceeds the effects of other published PA interventions for people with COPD and if successful will advance PA science in clinically important ways. The Active-Life program was developed by Dr. Larson and through a series of preliminary studies; its feasibility is well established and preliminary data are promising. We propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing Active-Life against an active control. We will enroll 183 people with moderate to very severe COPD. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, end of the 10 week intervention and at 3, 6 and 12 months after the end of the intervention. The primary dependent variables are objectively measured PA and sedentary behavior, measured with ActivPAL and Actigraph accelerometers simultaneously. Secondary outcome measures are indicators of frailty: 6-minute distance walk, isometric strength of knee flexors and extensors, Short Physical Performance Battery and self- reported physical function. Potential mediators include barriers-efficacy for PA and outcome expectations for PA. Innovations include the focus on LPA, objective measures of PA 24/7 and the use of FCT in COPD. This application is in response to NIH FOA PA-14-344 self-management for health with chronic conditions."
"9384837","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ultrasound technology has been shown to be a new tool in the treatment of speech sound disorders. It helps diagnose problems and can provide visual feedback to help children correct errors they make in producing the sounds of their language. Recent advances have made this imaging technique more accessible to clinicians, both in terms of price and of ease of use. The present proposal will facilitate the translation of the research into clinical practice so that a wide range of clients can begin to benefit from these technological advances.  One part of the project will test the usefulness of looking at the types of tongue shapes used by children with speech problems. Research has found that some children use tongue shapes that are relatively adult-like but incorrect, while others use an undifferentiated shape-that is, a shape that shows limited accommodation to different sounds. These undifferentiated tongue shapes may indicate that a different kind of therapy is called for. We will test two kinds of therapy on misarticulating children. We expect to find that knowing whether a child uses undifferentiated shapes or not (as seen with ultrasound imaging) will allow the selection of the better treatment program.  A particularly difficult sound is that of /r/, as i right, try and car. Ultrasound imaging can help children see what their tongue should be doing to get a perceptually correct sound. We will further test elements of this feedback procedure so that we can provide evidence-based guidance for implementing ultrasound treatment in clinics everywhere. Further support for the approach will come from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the tongue in children with good and poor /r/ pronunciation. We will validate ultrasound imaging of the tongue against MRI images, and we will also collect MRI images that can be used to model appropriate tongue shapes for children. While our MRI images from adults have proven useful in helping children pick an appropriate tongue shape for /r/, we predict that MRI images of children will be even more informative. Improving the articulation of this common sound will help thousands of children."
"9414311","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): 20% of all human cancers are associated with viruses functioning as biological cofactors in driving these cancers. Some of these viruses may have a direct role in mediating these cancers as in the case of HIV related cancers which includes Kaposi's sarcoma, pleural effusion lymphomas and lymphoproliferative disease. There is also an increase in the number of HPV related patients for example in the immunocompromised patients who are on HAART therapy and in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. The Tumor Virology Training Program at the University of Pennsylvania serves as the central forum for facilitating interactions among investigators involved in cancer-related viral research on the Penn campus which provides a more directed training for trainees. Program members have expertise in EBV, KSHV, HPV, HCV, HIV and other retroviruses. The biomedical community at Penn would like to continue the momentum of this training program in Tumor Virology for training predoctoral and postdoctoral students. There are 18 trainers in this program all of whom are committed to training pre and postdoctoral fellows for biomedical research careers. All faculty have well-funded NIH programs supported by the R21, R01, R43 or P01 mechanism, DOD and other private foundation monies. The training program seeks to continue support of 2 predoctoral and 4 postdoctoral students annually for each of the 5 years of funding. The number of trainees in labs of the trainers of this program has been consistently increasing and we anticipate this trend continuing in the coming years. Thus, we would like to have available slots for this continued increase in the number of predoctoral and postdoctoral candidates in the program. Viral related cancers are expected to increase as the technology for identifying these agents improves. We expect to provide an atmosphere of collaboration between clinical and basic scientists for our trainees who will have the opportunity to formulate ideas which will lead to basic and translational studies initiating and maintaining a cohesive group in tumor virology. The increased incidence of viral associated cancers, the commitment of the trainers and the institution with a well organized training program will provide an outstanding training environment for pre and postdoctoral candidates in tumor virology."
"9418811","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  While tremendous progress has been made in genetic definition and biological treatments for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), there remains a lack of fundamental knowledge about the pathogenesis and heterogeneity of this disorder. Recent technological developments allow for precise molecular analysis of disease tissues down to the single cell level. We propose to interrogate circulating immune cells and synovial tissue cells to identify the molecular and cellular correlates between systemic immune cell diversity, synovial pathology and clinical phenotypes. In Specific aim 1 (phase 0), we will optimize processes for the preparation and storage of synovial tissue and peripheral blood leukocyte samples in order to support a variety of advanced analytic techniques. These include single cell RNA seq of synovial tissue cells, epigenetic studies (ATAC-Seq), CyTOF mass cytometry for high-dimensional analysis of cellular phenotypes, and RNA seq analysis of at least 12 peripheral blood leukoctye subsets. We will also support development and feasibility studies of novel technologies for in situ molecular and cellular analysis of histological sections of synovial tissu. In addition, we will develop synovial cell lines to enable detailed study of synovial cell biology.In Specific Aim 2 (phase 1), we will enroll 30 subjects with rheumatoid arthritis for study of blood and synovial tissue using the technologies developed and validated in phase 0. A systems level analysis of these data will drive the selection of specific assays to be utilized in a larger patiet cohort. In Specific Aim 3 (phase 2), we will carry out an observational cohort study of 250 early RA patients enrolled over a three year period with analysis of both synovial tissue and peripheral blood leukocytes. We will employ a set of focused assays that emerge from the studies in Phase 0 and 1. The disease course, therapy and response to therapy will be documented in all patients. We will address the following hypotheses: 1) multiparameter analysis of synovial tissue can define subsets of disease with distinct clinical features or outcomes; 2) analysis of peripheral blood cell subsets with high dimensional molecular and cellular data, can identify correlates for these disease subsets; 3) useful parameters can be developed that can identify, as well as predict, therapeutic response."
"9207453","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal regulation of glycemia (dysglycemia) has a very long time course, from its earliest stage, labeled pre-diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The 11-year follow-up DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the relatively brief 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Prevention was cost-saving with MET and cost-effective with ILS. Overall, the risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (A1C). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those who had A1C ?6.5% at study end.  The proposed DPPOS Phase 3 will study the DPPOS cohort for 10 more years, taking advantage of the long-term randomized exposure to MET and the densely phenotyped and genotyped DPPOS cohort (n=2778), which includes nearly 1600 patients with known T2D duration and ~1200 who have not developed T2D, to address yet unanswered questions about long-term exposure to MET and ILS initiated during pre-diabetes. DPPOS Phase 3 will examine outcomes that are of increasing public health concern in the aging population with pre-diabetes and T2D, including the putative benefits of MET on development of CVD and cancer. The main goals of DPPOS Phase 3 are to examine efficiently: 1) the long-term effects of metformin therapy begun in the pre-diabetic phase on risk for CVD and cancer; 2) the long-term effects by intention-to-treat of ILS and MET on further development of T2D and on traditional and more recently recognized complications of dysglycemia, and of their economic impact; and 3) the clinical course of dysglycemia, evaluated by categorical diagnoses (pre-diabetes vs diabetes) and as a continuum, and their associations with the development of complications, including analyses of interactions with DPP interventions and established and novel risk factors."
"9297426","Project Summary: Gram-negative bacteria harboring carbapenemases are rapidly spreading worldwide and are a significant public health concern, resulting in mortality upwards of 60%. Carbapenemase-producing organisms (CPO) are considered a triple threat due to their increasing prevalence, their multidrug-resistant (MDR) profile, and their ease of transmission from species to species and even among different genera of Gram-negative bacteria through transmissible genetic elements (i.e. transposons, insertion sequences, and plasmids). Knowledge gaps: Studies of CPO transmission in the US have generally been limited to outbreak settings; data regarding transmission in endemic settings are largely unknown. Additionally, studies evaluating transmission of carbapenemases have generally been restricted to Enterobacteriaceae; The role of glucose non-fermenters (e.g., Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter spp.) has mostly been ignored. We propose to fill these gaps in knowledge by understanding the molecular mechanisms of antibiotic resistance and spread amongst all CPO (Enterobacteriaceae and glucose non-fermenters) in a region of the US endemic for CPO. These data will be critical in determining how best to limit CPO transmission between patients and to guide therapeutic decisions. To accomplish these goals, we have assembled a team of clinician-scientists, biomedical engineers, and bioinformaticians with expertise in clinical microbiology, epidemiology, infectious diseases, antibiotic stewardship, and in applications of the novel MinION technology. Aim 1: Determine the molecular mechanisms of spread involved in the dissemination of CPO in a non-outbreak setting using whole genome sequencing (WGS). Aim 2: Identify all antibiotic-resistance genes harbored by the CPO isolates to link the resistance genes to the circulating clones or plasmids harboring carbapenemases. Aim 3: Determine if the association of resistance genes with particular plasmids or clones can be used to accurately predict antibiotic susceptibility profiles of CPO clinical isolates. Significance and Impact: By gaining a better understanding of the complexity of the molecular mechanisms of resistance and spread among CPO, we can help guide therapy and appropriate prevention strategies to halt the spread of these important pathogens within the clinical setting."
"9211351","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal for this proposal is to develop a unified, asymmetric approach to the akuammiline alkaloids, a diverse class of indoline-containing natural products. These natural products have a range of biological activities and may serve as leads for the development of new therapeutics to treat cancer, pain, inflammation, diabetes, and depression. In addition to their promising bioactivities, these compounds also possess highly complex structures. A streamlined synthetic route will provide access to a variety of these structures in an efficient manner, while addressing several challenges prevalent in chemical synthesis. In addition, with this research, useful quantities of these compounds will be accessible for biological testing.      The goals of this proposal will be accomplished through three main phases. First, a synthetic route to picrinine, one of the natural products of this family, will be developed. This synthesis wll help us develop the chemistry needed to access the akuammiline natural products, while also providing access to a family member that has never been synthesized before. Next, an asymmetric route to an early-stage intermediate will developed, which will potentially provide access to (-)-picrinine, (-)-aspidophylline A, and other natural products in an enantiospecific fashion. Other targets that will be prepared, none of which have been synthesized before, are: (+)-strictamine, (-)-11-methoxyvincorine, (-)-11-demethoxyquaternine, and (-)-?-akuammigine. It should be stressed that each of these compounds contains a different core structure. As such, establishing a generalized route to include these compounds will advance the field of chemical synthesis due to the structural diversity that the route promises to build. In addition, any compounds that come from this proposed research will be submitted for biological evaluation. This opens the possibility of conducting further research to fully gauge the biological activities f these compounds with respect to their structures and targets."
"9207480","This project responds to PAR 14-153, Temporal Dynamics of Neurophysiological Patterns as Potential Targets for Treating Cognitive Deficits in Brain Disorders.  As described in the RFA, a rich body of evidence suggests that cognitive processes are associated with particular patterns of neural activity. These data indicate that oscillatory rhythms, their co-modulation across frequency bands, spike-phase correlations, spike population dynamics, and other patterns might be useful drivers of therapeutic development for cognitive improvement in neuropsychiatric disorders. This project uses parallel human and non-human primate (NHP) investigations to evaluate effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)/transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) on neural oscillatory patterns underlying auditory cognitive impairments in schizophrenia (Sz), with particular emphasis on impairments in theta and delta phase reset mechanisms and delta/gamma phase amplitude coupling. In addition it evaluates the role of N- methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) in the etiology of oscillatory dysfunction in Sz, as well as the ability of tDCS/tACS to reverse NMDAR antagonist-induced impairments in NHP as a model for future therapeutic development. The project addresses Topic 1 of the RFA by mapping neuro-oscillatory patterns underlying impaired auditory information processing in Sz using parallel human and NHP studies; Topic 2 by investigating mechanisms underlying NMDAR antagonist-induced effects; Topic 3 by evaluating tDCS/tACS effects on neuro-oscillatory function in both NHP and Sz; and Topic 4 by evaluating relative effects of high definition (HD-tDCS) and conventional tDCS using neurocomputational mapping approaches. The project includes active manipulations in both humans and NHP, and tests specific hypotheses regarding low frequency (delta, theta) oscillation and cross-frequency (e.g. delta/gamma) phase-amplitude coupling impairments as a basic mechanism of neurocognitive impairment in Sz. The recording methods detect neural activity directly using multichannel surface/intracranial electrodes in humans and NHP, respectively, and employ spectral analyses of EEG data along with quantitative behavioral measures as the primary outcome variables. Auditory dysfunction, as reflected both behaviorally and by impaired generation of mismatch negativity (MMN) and other auditory potentials is a prominent and severe feature of Sz and contributes directly to global functional outcome via direct impact on processes such as auditory hallucinations, phonological processing impairments and social cognition. Deficits in MMN generation, moreover, predict conversion to psychosis among at risk individuals. The proposed stimulation approaches including HD- tDCS and delta frequency tACS are highly novel and will have direct, real-world impact not only on neurocognitive dysfunction in Sz, but also on related forms of neurocognitive impairments across relevant associated neuropsychiatric disorders."
"9320019","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Unnatural amino acids provide an abundantly rich source of structural and functional diversity for the development of innovative materials and peptide mimetics. Such structural motifs play a particularly crucial role in drug discovery, featuring in a number of commercially available pharmaceuticals for the treatment of diseases. Despite their biological relevance, non-canonical amino acids (particularly heterocyclic ?-amino acid variants) represent synthetically challenging targets. The goal of the proposed research is therefore to provide a robust platform for the synthesis of unnatural ?-amino acids, with a focus on heterocyclic variants, and to facilitate their rapid incorporation into therapeutic leads. The frst specific aim of this study is to develop a C-H functionalization approach for the preparation of unnatural amino acids from novel ?-amino acid sulfinate building blocks. Metal sulfinate salts are known precursors to alkyl radical intermediates capable of participating in the efficient and high-yielding oxidative C-H functionalization of heteroaromatic substrates. By preparing a small toolbox of amino acid sulfinate derivatives, rapid access to a diverse library of heterocyclic amino acid variants will be possible through programmed reaction with heteroaromatic substrates under oxidative C-H functionalization conditions. Reaction of the sulfinate-derived alkyl radical intermediate with a variety of radical acceptors will also be probed, with the aim of enhancing the diversity of unnatural amino acids accessible using the proposed methodology.     Given the growing pharmaceutical relevance of peptide drugs and peptidomimetics bearing non-native structural motifs, new methods for the rapid incorporation of unnatural amino acids into peptide drug leads are in high demand. As such, the second specific aim of the proposed research is to develop a platform for the efficient, late-stage incorporation of unnatural amino acids into therapeutic peptide targets. The proposed methodology entails the synthesis of amino acids bearing latent sulfinate functionalities and the incorporation of these stable sulfinate derivatives into target peptides using solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). Following construction of the peptide backbone, the latent sulfinate may be unmasked (on-resin or in solution) to provide an amino acid sulfinate poised for C-H functionalization. This methodology will therefore enable the late-stage introduction of structural diversity and complexity, facilitatng the rapid preparation of peptide drug analogues, which would otherwise require de novo synthesis. The proposed research aims will therefore expedite the process of drug development, greatly increasing the accessibility of non-native amino acid building blocks and facilitating their incorporation into novel therapeutic leads."
"9234535","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lipid molecules act not only as energy resources or physical barriers, they are also actively involved in regulating cellular signaling, membrane trafficking, and the transcriptional network. Lipid metabolic dysfunction contributes to the development of various human diseases. Fatty acids are building blocks and precursors of all lipid molecules and have crucial impact on cell physiology and pathology. Excess accumulation of saturated fatty acids in non-adipose tissues leads to cytotoxicity and the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases, cardiomyopathy and type II diabetes mellitus; whereas unsaturated fatty acids are less toxic and even exert protective effects. Recent studies suggest that differences of fatty acids in lipotoxicity may be associated with their distinct efficiency duing the incorporation into lipid droplets (LDs). However the underlying molecular mechanisms governing this LD incorporation heterogeneity between different fatty acid molecules remain poorly understood. In our recent studies, we have developed a new chemical imaging strategy for tracking the spatiotemporal dynamics of specific lipid molecules at the subcellular resolution in living cells and organisms, and directly visualized the difference between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids during their incorporation into LDs. This proposal aims to dissect the molecular mechanisms that regulate LD incorporation heterogeneity between different fatty acid molecules, and will combine innovative technology development and detailed mechanistic characterization. Aim 1 will develop a high-throughput imaging/sorting microfluidic platform based the new chemical imaging microscopy. Aim 2 will elucidate new genes and pathways in regulating fatty acid metabolic dynamics through high-throughput forward genetic screens. We have established unique collaborations with scientists for this project. Successful accomplishment of the proposed studies will provide a new technology platform for whole-organism microscopic screening, and provide new insights into fatty acid metabolism and their physiological and pathological functions."
"9348941","Abstract This proposal is largely motivated by our involvement with the Botswana Combination Prevention Project (BCPP) which is an on-going large scale human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) cluster randomized prevention trial conducted in 30 communities across Botswana. As in most HIV prevention studies, incomplete data on HIV status and nonresponse to queries about sexual behavior is an important challenge the study currently faces, with data likely missing not at random and in complex patterns across individuals. Recognizing that existing statistical methods for missing data are largely ill-suited to fully address this important problem in HIV research, we propose to develop the next generation of missing data methods going well beyond current theory of identification and inference. Specifically, we propose (1) to develop a unified theory of identification bringing together recent developments in the theory of identification based on causal graphs with recent identification results from the statistics literature. This will allow us to establish conditions under which in complex missing data settings as in the BCPP, one can untangle features of the underlying population which may be of scientific interest from features of the non-response process not necessarily of scientific interest;(2) to build on (1) to develop corresponding inverse-probability-weighted and doubly robust methods for statistical inference in the BCPP where data are likely to be missing not at random and in complex patterns; (3) to develop novel semiparametric imputation methods that solely rely on assumptions encoded in the nonresponse process, thus allowing the complete data distribution in the BCPP to remain unscathed by the imputation process; (4) to develop user-friendly software to facilitate widespread use of the methods developed in Aims 1-3, and to apply and demonstrate their good performance in extensive simulation studies as well as in answering scientific queries of primary interest in the BCPP."
"9237539","Almost all archaea and half of bacteria contain Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats-CRISPR-associated proteins (CRISPR-Cas) adaptive immune systems that protect them against foreign genetic elements invasion. While diverse, all CRISPR-Cas function through three common steps: (i) adaptation, i.e., acquisition of foreign DNA segments (spacers) into CRISPR arrays; (ii) CRISPR array transcription and transcript processing to produce mature CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs), and (iii) interference, when Cas effector enzymes are guided by crRNAs to matching targets leading to target cleavage and ultimate invader genome destruction. As any immune system, CRISPR-Cas must be capable of self/non-self discrimination to prevent autoimmune death of the host caused by acquisition of spacers from own DNA followed by self-interference. A remarkable mechanism of self/non-self discrimination called ?priming? operates in type I CRISPR-Cas systems: acquisition of spacers from DNA containing partial matches to pre-existing CRISPR array spacers is dramatically stimulated compared to acquisition from DNA devoid of such sequences. While partially matching crRNAs that promote primed adaptation are incapable of efficient interference, all components of the interference machinery are required for primed adaptation. The mechanistic relationship between the interference and adaptation modules of CRISPR-Cas response during primed adaptation is not clear. In this work, protein-nucleic acid complexes and nucleic acid intermediates of CRISPR interference and primed adaptation by the Type I CRISPR- Cas system of Escherichia coli, the best-studied microbe, will be characterized in vivo and in vitro, and host functions that affect both processes will be revealed. In addition to uncovering a functional link between CRISPR interference and primed adaptation, programmable effector complexes with expanded targeting potential will be created as a result of proposed work and highly sensitive quantitative biophysical methods to study effector-target interactions will be developed."
"9419360","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hearing loss is the most common sensory disorder in the US, afflicting over 36 million people;  thus, identification of modifiable risk factors is a vital public health issue. Strikingly, there are  only limited prospective data on common and potentially modifiable risk factors for this highly  prevalent, disabling condition. In addition to noise, factors potentially associated with risk of  hearing loss include analgesics, vitamins, alcohol, menopausal status and postmenopausal  hormone use.  Aspirin, acetaminophen and ibuprofen are the three most commonly used drugs in the U.S.  The ototoxic effects of high dose salicylates are well-known. Our preliminary studies in men  found an increased risk of hearing loss with regular moderate use of aspirin, NSAIDs, and  acetaminophen; however, this has not been prospectively studied in women. Vitamins, such as  folate, A, C, D, and E, may play important roles in maintenance of hearing. Alcohol intake may  have a variable impact on hearing, depending on the level of use. Additionally, estrogen may  play a role in hearing function, thus menopausal status and postmenopausal hormone use may  have important implications for hearing loss. We will examine these issues prospectively in  large ongoing cohort studies involving over 150,000 women (Nurses' Health Studies I and II).  To identify factors that can be modified at an early stage to conserve hearing, will examine  audiometrically measured change in hearing sensitivity over 3 years in a subset of 3000  women in NHS II with either no or mild hearing loss. The secondary outcome will be selfreported  professionally diagnosed hearing loss in the entire study population. We expect more  than 5000 incident cases in each female cohort to be identified and confirmed by a  supplementary questionnaire. We will use a multidisciplinary approach to examine the  association between these common factors and the risk of hearing loss."
"9234729","ABSTRACT Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease characterized by heterogeneity of presentation, an undulating course, and a remarkably elevated risk for premature cardiovascular disease. Platelets have been understudied as a relevant contributor to premature atherosclerosis in SLE. Yet these cells, which contain transcripts and the necessary molecular machinery to conduct translation, are intercellular regulators of inflammation and immune activation and play a key role in atherothrombosis. Platelets express low affinity type 2 receptor (Fc?RIIA) whose ligand is the Fc portion of IgG. A single amino acid substitution, H131R, in the extracellular ligand binding domain increases the affinity for IgG and may account for individual variation in platelet activation, specifically gain of function. Leveraging a well-characterized SLE cohort, we identified a significant enrichment of carotid plaque in patients carrying at least one copy of the variant compared to those homozygotic for the ancestral gene. In a second SLE cohort, a significant increase in monocyte-platelet aggregates (MPA) in patients carrying the variant versus ancestral gene was observed. Although not yet assessed for genotype, SLE platelets exhibited a hyperreactive phenotype relative to healthy donors. Accordingly, it is hypothesized that platelet activity measurements and platelet-derived coding and non-coding RNA are significantly influenced by Fc?RIIA genotype. Two aims provide complementary studies to evaluate the underlying mechanism of increased platelet activity in SLE. In Specific Aim 1 the relationship between SLE platelet phenotype and transcriptome in the context of Fc?RIIA genotype will be investigated. To test the influence of Fc?RIIA genotype on platelets, a multidimensional panel of platelet activity markers representing different pathophysiological mechanisms will be measured, including: light transmission aggregometry (LTA); leukocyte- and monocyte-platelet aggregates; reticulated platelets; platelet receptor expression of PAC-1, CD40 ligand, P-selectin; platelet size; and the platelet transcriptome. Readouts will be assessed and compared in three groups of SLE subjects: H/H homozygotes, R/H heterozygotes, and R/R homozygotes. In Specific Aim 2 the goal is to molecularly assess platelet reactivity dependent on Fc?RIIA ligation and the impact of genotype on the phenotype of the vascular targets, endothelial cells (ECs) and macrophages. In contrast to Specific Aim 1, the approach utilizes platelets from healthy controls (H/H, R/H, and RR) since platelets from SLE patients may be intrinsically coated with immune complexes (ICs) accounting for baseline reactivity. Co-treatment of platelets with anti-CD9 will serve as a proxy of ICs and Fc?RIIA dependency approached using blocking antibodies. ECs and macrophages co-cultured with anti-CD9 platelets will be assessed for both pro-inflammatory and protective signaling cascades. Identification of a novel biomarker to gauge response to therapy, and/or to be used to identify patients at increased risk for premature cardiovascular disease and likely to benefit from anti-platelet agents, would be an advance."
"9243896","Project Summary/Abstract The Q fever pathogen Coxiella burnetii inhibits apoptosis (programmed cell death) in host cells in order to replicate in a stable intracellular compartment. Effector proteins secreted by Coxiella into host cell have been shown to inhibit apoptosis, although their mechanisms of action are not fully understood. Additionally, no information is currently available about the roles host microRNAs (miRNAs) potentially play in regulating apoptosis in Coxiella-infected cells. miRNAs are ~22 nt RNAs that regulate several biological processes in human cells, including apoptosis, by binding to target mRNAs and either blocking translation or causing target degradation. Our long-term goal is to understand how non-coding RNAs regulate Coxiella-host interactions. Towards attaining this goal, the objective of this application is to identify miRNAs that have a role in inhibiting apoptosis during Coxiella infection. Based on preliminary data that revealed potential functions for apoptosis-related miRNAs in Coxiella-infected macrophages, our central hypothesis is that miRNAs have a role in delaying apoptosis during Coxiella infection. The objective of this project will be accomplished by three specific aims: (1) Identify miRNAs that are induced or repressed by Coxiella infection. Using RNA-seq and qRT-PCR we will identify all miRNAs that are differentially expressed in Coxiella- infected THP-1 (human monocyte/macrophage) cells. (2) Determine miRNAs that inhibit apoptosis during Coxiella infection. For the miRNAs identified in our preliminary studies and in Aim 1, we will assay their ability to inhibit apoptosis. (3) Define the role of miR-148a during Coxiella infection. To begin to understand at a molecular level how miRNAs facilitate inhibition of apoptosis during Coxiella infection, we will interrogate the function of miR-148a. This miRNA was chosen because it was significantly down-regulated in Coxiella-infected cells in our preliminary analysis, and its target gene (Bcl-2) has critical roles in both C. burnetii development and apoptosis inhibition. The research proposed here is innovative, because it will depart from the status quo to investigate a whole new realm of host-pathogen dynamics: the RNA-level interaction between Coxiella and human cells. This work is significant because this will be the first study to uncover the roles of miRNAs during Coxiella infection, and based on our results, novel pharmaceutical agents that target miRNAs could potentially be developed to control chronic Coxiella infections, which are difficult to treat with currently available antibiotics. Our approach and results could also be broadly applied to studying the functions of miRNAs during infections caused by other intracellular pathogens."
"9378835","Project Summary Over the past 5 years, the Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC) has continued its upward trajectory in cancer research excellence and service to its catchment area. The WFBCCC catchment area includes the Piedmont and southern Appalachia, a region of 58 contiguous counties in North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia and Tennessee. The majority of this region is rural and exhibits significant racial health disparities. Elevated age-adjusted smoking rates, obesity rates, cancer incidence, and cancer mortality are observed across the WFBCCC catchment area when compared with the rest of the U.S. To target these issues, the WFBCCC conducts cutting-edge basic, clinical, and population research on the prevention, detection and treatment of cancer, and translates this knowledge into strategies to improve patient outcomes and reduce the incidence of cancer. WFBCCC cancer research funding is $37.9 million, of which over $14.9 million comes from the NCI; this represents a 25.3% increase in total cancer funding since the last CCSG renewal. Center research space under the Director?s authority increased by approximately 65,000 square feet, and the WFBCCC clinical facilities have been dramatically enhanced with the completion of the new eleven- story Cancer Hospital in 2013. This building houses all oncology inpatients and outpatients. The Center?s 127 members span the basic, clinical and population sciences and are organized into 4 Programs with substantial inter-and intra-programmatic productivity. Faculty additions enhanced tobacco control, tobacco-related cancer research, and precision medicine. Substantial investment in faculty, technology, and informatics significantly expanded cancer genomics capabilities. Enrollment of patients into treatment trials reached an all-time high in 2015, with a large increase in the number of patients enrolled in investigator-initiated trials. WFBCCC population scientists initiated exciting new efforts in cancer prevention and survivorship. Clinical scientists completed practice-changing studies in patients with glioma and lung cancer. Groundbreaking observations in prostate cancer emerged from WFBCCC inter-programmatic collaborations. WFBCCC basic science Programs continued to make high impact observations that are being translated into human therapeutics. The WFBCCC requests continued CCSG funding for 4 scientific Programs; 7 Shared Resources; 2 clinical research components; administration and leadership; planning and evaluation; and developmental funds. With these funds, a talented faculty integrated throughout the Cancer Center will make advances in the prevention, early detection, and treatment of cancer in the WFBCCC catchment area and the nation."
"9410890","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Peroxisomes are autonomously replicating organelles, and a major source of ROS generation in the cell. In the previous funding period, we made two major discoveries that form the basis for this competitive renewal: 1) the DNA repair kinase ATM moonlights in the cytoplasm where it signals to the TSC tumor suppressor to repress mTORC1 signaling in response to ROS and 2) the TSC signaling node (TSC1, TSC2 and Rheb) is resident at the peroxisome, where it is activated in response to ROS generation by this organelle. These findings have led us to hypothesize that the peroxisome is an import site for functional interaction between the TSC and ATM tumor suppressors, and that this interaction plays a key role in maintaining peroxisomal homeostasis by regulating selective autophagy of peroxisome (pexophagy). We hypothesize that ATM localizes to the peroxisome, where it is activated by peroxisomal ROS and signals downstream to TSC2 to suppress mTORC1 (Aim 1). In addition to the TSC tumor suppressor, our Preliminary Data suggest the ATM kinase also phosphorylates PEX5 (and perhaps other) proteins resident at the peroxisome (Aim 2), targeting them for ubiquitination and recognition by autophagy adaptor proteins to recruit the autophagosome to the peroxisome and mediate pexophagy (Aim 3). Together, the studies proposed in this application would be the first to demonstrate ATM signaling at the peroxisome, and to define new functional site for interaction of the ATM and TSC tumor suppressors, with important implications for understanding the role of these tumor suppressors in peroxisome homeostasis and maintenance of cellular redox balance."
"9410769","Project Summary/Abstract Cancerous cells reprogram their metabolism to accommodate their needs. A deep understanding of this metabolic reprograming can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer treatment. Different human cancers differ with respect to aspects of their metabolic rewiring, however a profound knowledge in this field is lacking. The main goal of my thesis project is to characterize the ways in which one-carbon metabolism ? a metabolic pathway highly altered in cancer? is utilized by different human cancers and elucidate its consequences on downstream processes such as epigenetics and biosynthesis. Using information in genomic profiles of individual tumors, I build computational models to infer metabolic landscapes, assess their implications in patient survival, and predict response to chemotherapy. By studying one-carbon metabolites in the human serum, I confirm the relevance of theses findings in human contexts and suggest potentials for dietary intervention approaches. In aim 1, I characterize the usage of serine through one-carbon metabolism across human cancers. I performed flux analysis using gene expression profiles of hundreds of human tumors, followed by experimental validation using metabolomics approaches. In aim 2, I identify the determinants of human serum methionine. Diet records, serum metabolomics, and clinical data from a cohort of human subjects were incorporated into computational models. The determinants of variability in serum methionine were then quantified, suggesting a mechanism for regulation of cellular epigenetics by the diet. In aim 3, I determine the sources of variation in DNA methylation across human cancers and the contribution of metabolism. I integrated molecular and clinical profiles of thousands of human tumors from the TCGA into machine-learning algorithms to identify their association with DNA methylation. A major contribution from one-carbon metabolism in regulating DNA methylation status in tumors was found. In aim 4, I predict response to anti-metabolic chemotherapies based on tumor genomics. I plan to translate my previous findings into clinical discoveries. To this end, I will demonstrate how tumor profiles can be used to model patient survival, predict response to chemotherapy, and move toward precision medicine."
"9235662","USING ADMINISTRATIVE AND CLINICAL DATA TO DETECT DRUG USE AND HIV RISK IN FOSTER CARE Project Summary  The candidate's goal is to develop an independent research career as a developmental psychologist focused on identifying mechanisms to prevent the onset of pervasive and detrimental health risk behaviors, including substance abuse and HIV risk behaviors, among adolescents and young adults involved in foster care. She has experience in examining psychosocial and behavioral processes during this period of development and a strong publication record for the current phase in her career. Her previous training has emphasized development during adolescence and the transition to adulthood and health behaviors during this timeframe. In the K01, she proposes to expand her training to become an expert leader in team science approaches to address substance use and HIV risk behaviors during adolescence and the transition to adulthood, specifically focusing on foster youth, using child welfare administrative data and electronic medical records (EMR). Her training will emphasize: 1) development as an independent researcher and leader in interdisciplinary approaches to addressing health and development among foster youth, 2) substantive training in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors, and 3) the use of machine learning to distinguish youth at risk, with the end goal of identifying opportunities for prevention. This will be accomplished through seminars and journal clubs offered at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), attending regional and national conferences and trainings on substantive topics, and completion of coursework in child maltreatment and machine learning. Finally, she will complete coursework and seminars addressing the ethical conduct of research. Dr. Beal's goal is to submit an R01, as PI, during the third year of this grant.  CCHMC, one of the top three pediatric research hospitals in the nation, is committed to Dr. Beal's career development. The research environment at CCHMC and within the Division of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology, and the mentors and collaborators identified in this proposal, are well-suited to Dr. Beal's interests and research goals. Dr. Beal will be co-mentored by Dr. Jennie Noll and Dr. Robert Ammerman. Dr. Noll has extensive experience as a researcher examining the impact of child maltreatment on adolescent development, particularly around sexual risk behaviors. Dr. Ammerman is a well-established researcher with expertise in prevention and intervention programs for high-risk populations. Her advisory committee includes Dr. Melissa Jonson-Reid, an internationally recognized researcher in child welfare and the use of administrative records, Dr. John Schulenberg, developmental psychologist and authority in adolescent and young adult substance use, Dr. Jessica Kahn, expert in adolescent medicine and sexual and HIV risk behaviors, and Dr. John Pestian, leader in machine learning and its application to clinical care. These individuals have made a commitment to mentor and guide Dr. Beal in research and career development.  The objective of this research program is to fill a gap in our current understanding of which adolescents in foster care are at greatest risk for substance use and HIV while simultaneously providing a means for establishing Dr. Beal's independence as a researcher. There are two aims of this proposal. Aim 1 uses discrete time survival analyses and linked child welfare and EMR data to examine the onset and prevalence of substance use and HIV risk behaviors for youth ages 10-20 in foster care compared to matched Medicaid-eligible youth not in foster care (Foster care n=2836; 1-to-1 matched comparison from ~9585 primary care patients). Findings will provide estimates of the rates of substance use and HIV risk behaviors across ages 10-20 and when they increase/decrease, which is critical for identifying the ideal time to begin prevention and intervention efforts. Aim 2 will draw on causal inference techniques and machine learning to identify youth who are substance using or at substantial risk for developing HIV prior to age 21 based on two categories of risk factors: 1 ? those common in adolescence, including parental substance use and mental health diagnoses; and 2 ? risk factors unique to foster care, including extended time in foster care and placement instability. Analyses will be conducted using structural equation modeling to identify predictors of substance use and HIV risk behaviors. Machine learning will be used to develop classifiers that distinguish youth likely to use substances and contract HIV. This approach will, for the first time, provide a means to identify youth at risk for these negative health outcomes before youth experience these consequences. Via this approach, clinicians and front-line workers will be able to easily distinguish youth at risk and dedicate more time to prevention efforts. The proposed program of training and research will provide a clear pathway for Dr. Beal to transition as an independent researcher. This unique program of research merges her expertise in developmental science and health during adolescence and the transition to adulthood with research in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors to support interdisciplinary, innovative team science approaches to prevent poor health outcomes among foster youth. The proposed studies in this application are significant because the findings take a developmental perspective to provide clinically useful information about which youth are at risk for poor health outcomes. Such an approach is innovative and will transform prevention delivery efforts for vulnerable foster youth."
"9403064","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mechanics, 3D structure, and biochemical composition of the extracellular matrix (ECM) significantly influences diverse biological outcomes, including cellular polarization, differentiation, apoptosis, migration, and proliferation For example, ECM alignment triggers polarized cell morphologies and facilitates migration away from the primary tumor. However, it remains poorly understood how cells spatiotemporally integrate 3D ECM cues in order to selectively orchestrate downstream signaling. The objective of the proposed research here aims to further our understanding this process. Specifically, I will investigate how mesenchymal cells spontaneously establish anteroposterior cell polarity in 3D ECM environments. Towards these means, I will evaluate the spatiotemporal evolution of cell-collagen interfaces, integrin activation, Rho family GTPase signaling, and cytoskeletal dynamics, in mesenchymal cells undergoing 3D polarization. I hypothesize that ECM fibers oriented normal to the cell surface will trigger integrin clustering and the formation of mature matrix adhesions (Aim 1). Furthermore, I hypothesize that Rho family GTPase activation will be bifurcated into focal adhesion-dependent and independent regimes (Aim 2), and that this will result in ECM context-dependent modulation of actin polymerization, bundling, dendritic branching, actomyosin contraction, and depolymerization (Aim 3). This will be accomplished by light- sheet imaging of mesenchymal cells embedded within reconstituted ECM-like environments, acute pharmacological perturbations, and computer vision analysis of ECM fiber orientation, cell shape, signal transduction, and cytoskeletal dynamics. This research will serve as the foundation from which further studies can evaluate 3D spatiotemporal cell signaling in physiological and pathophysiological ECM states."

This led to novel loci chromosomes 9, 10 and 12. In 1998, the U01 was transformed into an R01, and in 2003, became a Merit Award (R37). Since 1998, the project was aimed at the identification and characterization of novel familial AD genes using family-based association analyses. In 2005, we initiated genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using Affymetrix 500K genotyping arrays and in 2008, we reported genome-wide significant results from this screen, focusing on CD33, and ATXN1. In 2009, we reported two rare, pathogenic AD mutations in the a-secretase gene, ADAM10. Over the past three years, we completed additional GWAS on the NIMH sample and another AD family sample (NCRAD), using the Affymetrix 6.0 (~900K single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs] and ~900K single copy probes) and Affymetrix 25K Coding SNP genotyping arrays. In addition, we carried out GWAS on four AD clinical-, pathological-, imaging-, and biomarker-based quantitative endophenotype samples. These GWAS data are being analyzed separately and as part of a meta-analysis using several imputed AD case-control GWAS datasets. In addition to the initial description of CD33 as a genome-wide significant AD risk gene, later confirmed independently in case-control samples, we identified SNPs in several other candidate genes exhibiting significant results by meta-analysis (see Preliminary Data). In the renewal of this project, we propose to analyze, validate, and follow-up the results of whole genome sequencing (WGS) of the entire NIMH sample (1510 subjects in 437 AD families) using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. WGS sequencing costs will be covered by the Cure Alzheimer's Fund. We will employ state-of-the-art statistical and bioinformatic approaches to identify functional genomic variants influencing AD risk and time-to-onset. In Aim 1, we will analyze WGS data from the NIMH sample to identify functional variants that are either linked to Mendelian forms of early-onset AD (EOAD) or associated with risk for late-onset AD (LOAD). We will also carry out various association analyses i.e. gene- based, multi-marker framework, and extreme discordant sib-pair, to identify common variants that influence risk for LOAD. In Aim 2, we will set out to replicate novel variants discovered in Aim 1 using two independent AD family-based cohorts. We will also impute rare variants and conduct association analyses on four case- control samples (NIA-LOAD, TGEN2, GenADA, and ADNI). We will also sequence candidate loci in African- Americans and Pacific Islanders, and compare our results from AD families to those obtained in various psychiatric disorders. In Aim 3, we will carry out preliminary functional studies on select functional variants, assessing effects on gene function and expression and AD-related pathogenicity, e.g. Ab metabolism and tauopathy. For promising variants, in vivo validation will be performed in independently funded future studies."
"9344766","SUMMARY Atopic dermatitis is a chronic dermatological condition afflicting mostly infants and young children. Current treatments are associated with a wide range of side effects therefore development of novel therapeutic agents that are efficacious and have an improved safety profile is needed. Although disease etiology has yet to be fully understood, skin inflammation is known to be critically involved in the disease pathology. Signum has identified two novel potent topical anti-inflammatory agents (lead compound - SIG1451, backup compound ? SIG1456) called isoprenylcysteines (IPCs) with no detectable adverse affects. The proposed Phase IIB research plan will enable the filing of an investigational new drug (IND) application for the first in human trials in AD. In addition this grant proposal will buttress Post-IND clinical efforts by completing additional juvenile safety and continue drug substance and drug product development for Phase II clinical trials."

"9395060","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for a training program in Immunology and Pathogenesis (IMP) is designed to support the training activities of ten field-leading scientists whose research centers on immunobiology, the faculty members are all members of the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology (MCB), and each has ample research support and a strong commitment to mentoring. The training program is centered in the MCB Division of Immunology and Pathogenesis, in which most training faculty are members. The IMP Training program will focus on basic immunological mechanisms in the context of infections, cancer and immunopathology. We are motivated by the shared belief that achieving a thorough, basic understanding of recognition, activation, regulation, differentiation and interactions of cells of he immune system will lead to therapies for infectious disease, cancer and other ailments, and that training young investigators in this approach, while providing broad training in basic molecular and cell biology, offers a most productive avenue for enhancing success in this endeavor. The MCB Department and the training faculty have a long-standing and defining principle for training: early, persistent emphasis on student and postdoc training for an individually directed path to innovative research. The program is strongly committed to recruiting and training students and postdocs from diverse personal backgrounds. The IMP program will provide a home for trainees in Immunology and Pathogenesis and support for training related activities. We propose support for 3 graduate students and 3 postdoctoral fellows. Graduate students will generally be supported starting in their second year to ensure commitment to the research area and to provide additional information to evaluate their capability of providing exceptional contributions to the program. Postdoctoral trainees will generally be supported starting in their first or second year. In general trainees will be supported for 2 years on the training grant, with additional years supported from other sources. The training grant is designed to be the successor of an NCI-supported training grant (Molecular Immunology and Tumor Biology Training Program, T32 CA009179), which supported immunology research at Berkeley for 35 years. Due to the evolution of the research programs and new recruitments to the Division, the focus of that training grant solely on cancer has become increasingly restrictive. We therefore concluded that an NIAID-supported training grant focused more broadly on immunobiology research is a much better fit for our group. Consequently we are applying for this new training grant rather than for a renewal of T32 CA009179."
"9207129","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal regulation of glycemia (dysglycemia) has a very long time course, from its earliest stage, labeled pre-diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The 11-year follow-up DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the relatively brief 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Prevention was cost-saving with MET and cost-effective with ILS. Overall, the risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (A1C). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those who had A1C ?6.5% at study end.  The proposed DPPOS Phase 3 will study the DPPOS cohort for 10 more years, taking advantage of the long-term randomized exposure to MET and the densely phenotyped and genotyped DPPOS cohort (n=2778), which includes nearly 1600 patients with known T2D duration and ~1200 who have not developed T2D, to address yet unanswered questions about long-term exposure to MET and ILS initiated during pre-diabetes. DPPOS Phase 3 will examine outcomes that are of increasing public health concern in the aging population with pre-diabetes and T2D, including the putative benefits of MET on development of CVD and cancer. The main goals of DPPOS Phase 3 are to examine efficiently: 1) the long-term effects of metformin therapy begun in the pre-diabetic phase on risk for CVD and cancer; 2) the long-term effects by intention-to-treat of ILS and MET on further development of T2D and on traditional and more recently recognized complications of dysglycemia, and of their economic impact; and 3) the clinical course of dysglycemia, evaluated by categorical diagnoses (pre-diabetes vs diabetes) and as a continuum, and their associations with the development of complications, including analyses of interactions with DPP interventions and established and novel risk factors."
"9346316","Abstract Natural products have outstanding pharmaceutical pedigree - approximately 50% of FDA approved small molecule drugs are derived from plant, bacterial or fungal sources. To discover new natural products, Warp Drive Bio has assembled an enormous proprietary and searchable database of microbial genomes and biosynthetic gene clusters. To date, our database comprises ~135,000 genomes sequenced encoding the biosynthesis of ~3.5 million natural compounds. Over the course of our genome mining campaign, we identified WDB-002, a cyclic polyketide synthase (PKS) natural product, by a search for biosynthetic clusters related to FK506 and Rapamycin. Both FK506 and Rapamycin target important signaling pathways with high potency and selectivity, and these compounds have entered the clinic with annual sales of $3 billion. We propose to force the evolution of this clinically-relevant family of natural products by applying combinatorial biosynthesis techniques to create a library of new WDB-002 analogs. The innovation described here represents an integrated platform for the combinatorial biosynthesis of polyketides on an industrial scale. We built a prediction algorithm for the engineering of novel PKS clusters by analyzing our vast genomic inventory of PKS natural products. Second, we developed a robust genetic assembly methodology to construct of a chemically diverse PKS library of WDB-002 analogs, and we expressed the library in an optimized Streptomyces host. Third, we have developed two mass spectrometry assays based on FKBP12 binding that allow the precise identification of WDB-002 analogs and a FKBP12 affinity proteomics-LC/MS2 assay to identify the protein targets of WDB-002 analogs in human lysates. The goal of this proposal is to assess the feasibility of large-scale evolvalog generation by performing a detailed analysis of a 650-member evolvalog library. In Aim 1, we propose to analyze the library by mass spectrometry to determine if the engineered clusters produce novel evolvalogs. In parallel, we will assess the genetic identity of each evolvalog expression construct by next-generation sequencing. By linking the identity of module-module combinations to successful polyketide production, we can refine our module swapping algorithm to increase the success rate for new library designs based on high-value PKS clusters. In Aim 2, we will map the human protein targets of 50 evolvalogs by a target-ID assay to understand the rules by which polyketide engineering can reprogram target engagement in human proteome. These data will accelerate the rational design of polyketide combinatorial libraries with novel target profiles, thus yielding a direct path to diverse polyketide natural product libraries for drug discovery."

"9269617","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will examine cognitive deficits in severe, life threatening anorexia nervosa before and after medical stabilization. Medical stabilization is established when the patient is consuming 2000-3000 kcal/day, the patient's laboratory values show that end organ failure is resolved or resolving, and that they are through the refeeding syndrome, the patient has minimal edema, and is physically strong enough to progress to eating disorder treatment programs, the patient is deemed as medically stable for discharge by the treating physician. The specific aims of this study are to quantify cognitive deficits in severe, lfe threatening anorexia nervosa, compare cognitive deficits before and after medical stabilization, compare cognitive deficits at baseline and medical stabilization between patients with the restricting subtype of anorexia nervosa to those with the binge-purge subtype, and to correlate changes in cognitive function to changes in serum leptin levels. Patients will be recruited from an acute medical stabilization unit that specializes in eating disorders. Patients will be between the ages of 18-35 and <70% ideal body weight. Patients will undergo cognitive testing within 3 days of admission and again at medical stabilization. Serum leptin levels will be measured at baseline and at medical stabilization. Changes in cognition will be correlated with changes in serum leptin levels."
"9231545","PROJECT SUMMARY Tumors are complex ecosystems containing cells with different functions, which interact to maintain the cancerous environment. Profiling tumors has been severely limited by their cellular diversity, because the methods used for molecular analysis of whole tumor samples might not reflect any single tumor cell accurately. Measuring the RNA composition of 10,000s of individual cells from a tumor could turn this heterogeneity into a benefit, by revealing druggable vulnerabilities in immune and stromal cells, as well as potentially dangerous tumor-initiating transcriptomes in rare cancer cells. To address this opportunity, we propose to adapt a powerful microfluidic platform that we have developed, known as inDrops, for low-cost high-throughput single- cell profiling in cancer biology and specifically for biopsy samples. Relatively little additional technology development is required to make this method practical for analysis of individual tumors for basic research or in a clinical setting. This project focuses on solidifying the advantages of this transformative novel platform through achievable steps. Currently, inDrops is the only single-cell transcriptomics platform with the scale and cell recovery rate required to make it a practical tool for biopsy analysis. Our specific aims focus on demonstrating the method on tumor samples, optimizing microfluidic engineering for robust work with biopsies, adapting the method to work with pre-fixed cells, adapting the method for screening with targeted gene panels, and integrating the resulting data with histological analysis so as to maximally facilitate diagnostically and prognostically relevant discoveries. Together, these advances will transform inDrops into a powerful method for wide use in cancer biology."
"9403361","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All eukaryotes have or once had mitochondria. These organelles are the remains of an ancient symbiosis with a bacterium early in eukaryotic evolution some 2 billion years ago. As such, mitochondria retain their own genome (mtDNA). Although it only encodes a small fraction of the genes encoded by nuclear DNA (nucDNA), its products must interact closely with their nucDNA-encoded counterparts in order to generate the energy needed for maintaining eukaryotic cellular functions. Mutations in mtDNA can lead to a breakdown in this interaction, with dire consequences for organismal health. Mutations in mtDNA accumulate rapidly compared to nucDNA in animals, and one general theory of ageing posits that the accumulation of somatic mtDNA mutations leads to ageing and the onset of age-related diseases. However, not all eukaryotes have elevated mtDNA mutation rates. To understand how underlying mtDNA mutations influence organismal health and fitness, the proposed research will examine mito-nuclear mismatch in the plant genus Silene, which occurs when mtDNA from one population/species is expressed against the nuclear background of a distant relative. Silene contains species with both slowly and rapidly evolving mtDNA, making it an ideal model for this research. The overarching question addressed by the proposed research is to determine how mito-nuclear interactions influence organismal physiology, ecology, and evolution.  Silene species and populations with varying degrees of evolutionary relatedness will be crossed in order to produce progeny with a range of predicted mito-nuclear mismatch severities. Standard growth phenotypes, metabolic rates, and fecundities will be assayed in these hybrids. Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) proficiency will be assessed in both control and mismatched individuals by assessing OXPHOS complex II and IV activity. Complex IV consists of both mtDNA and nucDNA-ecoded subunits and should show reduced activity in mismatched individuals, while complex II serves as a negative control, since it is composed solely of nucDNA-encoded subunits. Furthermore, differential gene expression will be assessed between a subset of control and mismatched individuals via RNA-Seq to test between several alternative hypotheses for how mismatch affects organismal function. Finally, control and mismatched individuals will be assessed under variable drought regimes to determine if specific mito-nuclear backgrounds may be adapted to particular environments. This work will extend our understanding of mito-nuclear genomic interactions by utilizing a well- suited model that complements previous studies. Its results will be relevant to ongoing issues in human health including advancing theories of ageing and commenting on ongoing debates regarding the long-term consequences of mitochondrial replacement therapy (aka, three-parent in-vitro fertilization)."
"9265970","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progression of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) is associated with trafficking of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV) infected leukocytes into the central nervous system (CNS), which appears to begin as early as 8 days post-infection. However, at this time the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of MCP- 1/CCL2 were found to be unchanged, thus making it challenging to explain how HIV-infected leukocytes are mobilized during this early stage of infection, which leads to the establishment of CNS reservoirs. Interestingly, our supporting data reveal that these early events noted in acutely infected individuals can be closely mimicked in HIV-infected humanized mice. Importantly, we observed marked platelet activation in these mice within 1 to 4 weeks of infection -as reported in persons with acute HIV infection-which was tightly correlated with the rate of human peripheral leukocytes migration into the CNS. Based on these findings, we posit that HIV triggers a push and pull mechanism throughout the course of infection that enables trafficking of infected leukocytes into the CNS. In this model, we propose that the activated platelets initially provide a push by directly interacting with infected leukocytes to facilitate migrationof leukocytes across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This follows with a rapid increase in the production of chemokines within the CNS thus establishing a complementing pull that recruits additional infected/activated leukocytes into the CNS. This model then, in full accordance with the available literature, accounts for how neuroinflammation is initiated, and maintained, in HIV-infected individuals. These studies will bring together five established investigators and one emerging investigator with proven expertise in virology, platelet/monocyte biology, animal models of HIV-infection, therapeutics, and HIV clinical research. Importantly, proposed studies will leverage research infrastructure offered by the University of Rochester Center for AIDS Research (UR-CFAR). Our studies contain great potential for clinical translation, in which, our investigations will reveal how early intervention may impact viral reservoirs in the CNS, and how a two-prong approach in which targeting viral entry into the CNS while dampening secondary inflammation would yield long-term neuroprotection and tissue homeostasis."
"9270386","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Attia's long-term goal is to improve lung health globally, conducting clinical research and trials in chronic lung diseases, with a focus on the role of HIV and other risk factors in influencing the pathophysiology and clinical course of lung disease. The research proposed in this application builds on her previous work, which found a significantly greater prevalence of chronic respiratory symptoms and abnormal spirometry among HIV+ adolescents compared to adults in a resource-limited setting. This K23 Career Development Award will provide Dr. Attia with essential research training to support her goal of becoming an independent investigator at the intersection of pulmonary disease, HIV and global health. Through this project, Dr. Attia will accomplish her immediate goals of attaining the expertise outlined in the following learning objectives: 1) training in measurement and analysis of lung growth in adolescents; 2) design and implementation of longitudinal studies; 3) quality control and monitoring of prospective studies; 4) advanced biostatistical methods to analyze complex data; and 5) responsible implementation of research activities in an international setting. These objectives will be achieved through a structured career development plan that incorporates formal coursework, mentoring by an advisory committee with collective expertise in pulmonary disease and lung growth, HIV, pediatrics, epidemiology, biostatistics and the use of biospecimens in clinical research, as well as protected time to gain practical research experience. Environment: The rich academic environment at the University of Washington (UW) is an ideal place for Dr. Attia's continued research training. UW is an outstanding biomedical research institution with a strong commitment to promoting the academic careers of promising investigators. The UW Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine is widely recognized for its Clinical Research Training Track and offers an intellectual environment that supports development of the skills necessary to collaborate with other investigators and achieve academic success. In addition to the resources and support provided within the Division, Dr. Attia will also have full access to the resources of the UW Department of Global Health Teaching, Research and Expert Education (TREE) program (directed by her co-mentor), which provides the administrative, clinical, laboratory and database management infrastructure that supports clinical research at the UW-affiliated Coptic Hope Center for Infectious Diseases in Nairobi, Kenya. Dr. Attia will receive directed training and mentoring in obtaining and analyzing spirometry in adolescents as a measure of lung growth and development through the resources of the UW Department of Pediatrics and the UW-led multi-site cystic fibrosis clinical trials network, Cystic Fibrosis Therapeutics Development Network. Dr. Attia will also have access to clinical research and biostatistical support through the UW School of Public Health and the Institute of Translational Health Sciences program (the Clinical and Translational Science Award program at UW). Research: Dr. Attia will examine differences in the prevalence, subtypes, risk factors and mechanisms of chronic lung disease, detected by baseline and repeat pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry over 2 years in 150 HIV+ adolescents from the Hope Center compared to 150 HIV- controls, block-matched on age and sex. Among HIV+ adolescents, chronic lung disease will be further characterized with baseline chest CT scans. She will determine the role of HIV infection on the manifestations of chronic lung disease at baseline and the change in lung function over time, considering the complex interplay with other risk factors including malnutrition and indoor biofuel burning. She will also evaluate whether severity of HIV disease, and biomarkers of chronic immune activation and inflammation are associated with an increased prevalence of chronic lung disease and diminished lung function growth over time. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it signifies the first study to 1) directly characterize the epidemiology and pathophysiology of chronic lung disease in HIV+ compared to HIV- adolescents in a resource-limited setting, 2) ascertain risk factors associated with change in lung function over time, assessed by repeated spirometry, in HIV+ compared to HIV- adolescents, and 3) determine whether serum markers of chronic immune activation, inflammation and HIV severity are associated with chronic lung disease, providing potential mechanistic insights. Findings of this research will provide novel insights into the subtypes and pathophysiologic mechanisms of chronic lung disease development and progression in HIV+ adolescents in resource-limited settings, shedding light on risk factors and mechanisms that can be targeted by preventative and therapeutic interventions to mitigate the burden of chronic lung disease."
"9381005","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer recurrence and treatment resistance represent the primary obstacles to current cancer therapies, with the underlying mechanisms largely unclear. In recent years, the hypoxic tumor microenvironment is regarded as one of the major causes mediating the treatment failures. Among the complicated tumor microenvironmental components, mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) and their derivative stromal fibroblasts are currently recognized as master regulators in every step of cancer progression including primary tumor growth and secondary metastasis. Moreover, accumulating evidence suggests that MSCs and stromal fibroblasts also play critical roles in chemoresistance through their proteomic or metabolic changes elicited by drug treatments. However, little is known whether MSCs and stromal fibroblasts are involved in radiotherapy resistance. My preliminary results revealed a much less susceptibility of MSCs to ionizing radiation, compared to cancer cells. In mouse models of breast cancer and melanoma, in contrast to untreated MSCs, the irradiated MSCs exerted a robust potential in promoting primary tumor growth and lung metastasis of cancer cells. Through gene expression comparison, irradiated MSCs were shown to express high levels of osteopontin (OPN) and CCL-5. Deficiency of OPN largely abrogated the cancer promoting effects of irradiated MSCs. We therefore hypothesize that MSCs and their derivative stromal fibroblasts are key radiation-responsive stromal components to facilitate cancer progression, through overexpression of OPN, CCL-5 and other mediators. Those stromal features very likely lead to radioresistance or cancer recurrence after radiotherapy. To test this hypothesis, in the mentored phase (K99) of this award, I will first validate the function and molecular mechanisms of radiation-modulated OPN and CCL-5 expression on MSCs in the tumor promoting potential. Furthermore, I will extend the findings in MSCs to their derivative stromal fibroblasts and develop novel stromal markers (OPN, CCL-5 and possibly other factors) to predict the radiotherapy failure in breast cancer patients. All of these endeavors during my mentored phase will contribute to the proposed work in the R00 phase of this award-to develop effective therapeutics to treat clinical relapse/failure of radiotherapy in animal models. During this independent phase, I will attempt to establish radiotherapy resistance model and cancer relapse model in mice, followed by testing potential chemical inhibitors or neutralizing antibodies to prevent and treat these failures. This study combines my previous training in mesenchymal stem cell biology and immunology, and my current training in breast cancer metastasis, treatment resistance and radiation oncology, which brings me to a new field investigating the roles of MSCs and stromal fibroblasts in treatment resistance at my independent stage. The results will not only provide important information for our understanding of the basic stroma radiology, but also help to develop novel therapeutics to target stromal OPN, CCL-5 and possibly other mediators as adjutants to improve the efficacy of radiotherapy."

Compared to the progress made in relating Hebbian plasticity to  animal learning, little is known about the behavioral significance of homeostatic synaptic plasticity. Based on  the newly discovered signaling pathway involved in homeostatic synaptic plasticity ? the synaptic retinoic acid  pathway, and building on the progress made in the past years, this study aims to deepen our understanding of  homeostatic synaptic plasticity by further exploring the involvement of postsynaptic exocytosis machineries and  trans-synaptic adhesion molecules in homeostatic synaptic plasticity. Moreover, taking advantage of the known  molecular components uniquely involved in the homeostatic synaptic plasticity, the study will probe in vivo  functional significance of homeostatic plasticity by applying state-of-art genetic tools in animal behavioral  studies. Through close collaboration with other projects of the Center, this project hopes to provide conceptual  advancement to our understanding of homeostatic synaptic plasticity and retinoic acid signaling.  Relevance  The candidate molecules investigated in this project have been implicated in Autism spectrum disorders.

"9256795","Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. This research proposal focuses on the systemic inflammatory response that can result from myocardial infarction (MI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), a common surgical intervention to treat or prevent MI. The goal of this research is to better understand the molecular signals controlling resolution of the systemic inflammatory response. This project seeks to define the activity of the cardioactive growth factor Neuregulin-1? (NRG) on the monocyte ERBB3 receptor, and the impact of this pathway on the inflammatory response in cardiovascular disease. The hypothesis is that: 1) NRG/ERBB3 signaling promotes resolution of the inflammatory response and 2) circulating NRG and monocyte ERBB3 expression may be independent predictors of the inflammatory response following MI and CABG, with low NRG/ERBB3 signaling indicating high risk for an unrestrained systemic inflammatory response. To test this hypothesis and to investigate the role of NRG/ERBB3 signaling, blood samples will be studied from human patients undergoing CABG prior to surgery, during surgery, and at 4-8, 24, and 96 hours after surgery. These samples will be analyzed for expression of inflammatory cytokines and other markers of inflammation and cardiac injury, and for correlation with circulating NRG or monocyte ERBB3 expression. In addition, monocytes will be treated with increasing doses of recombinant NRG and tested for inflammatory cytokine production in the presence of an inflammatory stimulus. In parallel, complementary studies will employ a mouse model of induced MI in the setting of genetic ablation of monocyte ERBB3 expression, accomplished by crossing a floxed ERBB3 mouse strain with a LysMCre driver strain. In this study, multiparametric myeloid cell analysis will be performed by flow cytometry to determine the extent of inflammatory cell infiltration into cardiac tissue at day 5. Structural and functional changes in the myocardium will be assessed by echocardiography at baseline and during subsequent stages of cardiac remodeling at day 7, 14 and 28 after MI. Scar tissue formation will be assessed by Masson's trichrome staining at day 28 after MI. This project will produce novel data about the currently uncharacterized roles of NRG and ERBB3 in the inflammatory response to MI and CABG, and will have broad relevance for the management of other types of systemic inflammatory processes. Through a combination of multidisciplinary mentoring, a thorough scientific investigation, participation in scientific meetings, focused instruction in manuscript and grant writing, and education on responsible conduct of research, these studies and the accompanying training plan will prepare the applicant for a nationally competitive and independent career in translational cardiovascular research."
"9265693","ABSTRACT Zika virus (ZIKV) has spread rapidly throughout South and Central America since it was first reported in Brazil in early 2015. A temporally-related increase in the incidence of microcephaly a few months after the peak of the epidemic in Brazil prompted the World Health Organization to declare a ZIKV public health emergency of international concern. To slow the spread of ZIKV and prevent its severe consequences, a better understanding of modes of transmission is urgently needed. ZIKV, like many arboviruses, is transmitted by mosquitos, but several case reports suggest that it can be sexually transmitted, which is particularly concerning during pregnancy given the virus?s potential teratogenicity. The investigators propose to characterize the epidemiology of Zika virus as it emerges in a ZIKV-naïve population in León, Nicaragua via a cohort study of patients presenting to the city?s public hospital?s emergency department with fever, rash, and/or conjunctivitis. All participants will be interviewed with a questionnaire to determine risk factors for vector-borne and sexual acquisition of ZIKV. Each participant will provide blood, urine, and saliva to be screened for ZIKV, and those diagnosed with acute ZIKV will be followed for 6-12 months, providing serial biological specimens (blood, urine, saliva, semen, cervicovaginal fluid, and breast milk as applicable) to assess duration of shedding in various body compartments and assess potential for sexual transmission of ZIKV. Genital tract samples containing detectable virus will be used to inoculate cell cultures to evaluate viability of ZIKV in semen, cervicovaginal fluid, and breast milk. Next generation sequencing will be employed to determine if ZIKV isolates in the genital tract are replicating independently or contain quasispecies not found in the blood. NGS technology will also be applied to samples from household members including sexual partners of index cases to evaluate phylogenetic relationships between ZIKV strains transmitted by mosquito compared to those possibly transmitted through sexual contact. The University of North Carolina (UNC) and the University of Nicaragua (UNAN-León) have a longstanding and productive research collaboration and are ideally poised to study the emerging ZIKV epidemic. Nicaragua is an ideal site to execute this study because of the high incidence of arboviral infections, the robust research infrastructure at the proposed site, and the strong collaboration between UNC and UNAN- León. This unique collaboration affords us the ability to exchange research and analytic tools to better understand the epidemiology and pathogenesis of ZIKV as it emerges in a naïve population in Nicaragua. This research will generate novel data that are fundamental to the advancement of prevention and control interventions, particularly interventions that go beyond typical vector control programs to prevent sexual transmission and avert potentially catastrophic congenital infection. The study will add to existing research infrastructure to develop capacity for future studies on ZIKV transmission with the ultimate goal of reducing the burden of disease and preventing the adverse outcomes associated with the infection."
"9234320","While suicidal behavior occurs in the context of many psychiatric disorders, relatively few subjects with a psychiatric disorder attempt suicide. One of the most challenging tasks for clinicians is to identify which patients will actually go on to attempt suicide. Studies find no association between clinicians' prediction for a patient and their actual suicidal behavior. Thus, it is critical to identify objective biological signatures for suicidal behavior, the 2nd leading cause of death among youth. In an R21 pilot study, we found that inpatients admitted for their first suicide attempt had lower hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) compared to those admitted for suicidal ideation and healthy controls. HCC provides a retrospective assessment of cortisol levels over the past few months and thus prior to attempt in our R21. Lower HCC were also associated with increased lethality of the attempt within attempters. Suicide attempters also differed by their lower glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA and increased inflammation. In this R01, we propose to recruit a large sample of psychiatric inpatients (n=300), aged 18-30 years, with no prior history of suicidal behavior and enriched for suicidal ideation; and healthy controls (n=50); and follow them at 3, 6, and 12 months from intake. The risk for suicidal behavior is especially high during the first year after psychiatric hospitalization. We will collect biological data on HCC, gene expression in the HPA axis and inflammatory pathways, and systemic markers of inflammation (e.g., C- Reactive Protein, Tumor Necrosis Factor-?); and data on already-established clinical and behavioral predictors for suicidal behavior. We hypothesize that low HCC and downregulation of HPA axis genes together with upregulation of inflammatory genes and increased systemic inflammation at baseline will predict future suicidal behavior. Similarly, the trajectories of these biological alterations over time will be associated with worsening of clinical (impulsivity, aggression, sleep disturbances) and behavioral measures (decision-making, memory, and suicide-specific attentional biases and implicit cognitions). The models combining biological, clinical, and behavioral measures will show better performance in predicting attempts compared to models combining clinical and behavioral measures. We also propose to collect hair samples from subjects, aged 18-30 years, who died by suicide and compare them to those who died from accidental deaths on HCC, which reflects cortisol levels prior to death; we will also compare them on HCC to patients with no ideation, those with ideation, and those who go on to attempt suicide and thus examine the relation of HCC to risk across the full spectrum of suicidal behavior. This study is the first to examine the ability of biological markers in the HPA axis and inflammatory pathways to predict suicidal behavior and to examine them combined with clinical and behavioral predictors. This study will help better identify patients at highest risk who can then be targeted for closer monitoring and interventions; and will improve our understanding of the biological pathways for suicidal behavior, which will guide new therapeutic targets.  "
"9255053","Project Summary The Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus anthracis is a very strong candidate for potential bio- weaponization, and believed to have actually been weaponized by the former Soviet Union. Anthrax spores are readily found in nature or produced in the laboratory, are resistant to harsh conditions, and can survive for a long time in the environment. The microscopic spores could be formulated in powder form, sprays, food, or water. Two key toxins generated by combination of the protective antigen (PA) with either lethal factor (LF) or edema factor (EF) play a critical role in B. anthracis virulence. Current CDC recommendations following potential exposure to aerosolized B. anthracis spores consist of a combination of oral antibiotics and PA-based anthrax vaccine. However, in practice, these treatments cannot adequately address the adverse effects of bacterial toxins released post exposure. In this R41 proposal we intend to develop a novel approach to target neutralizing anti- toxin antibodies specifically to the site of infection. The approach exploits the cell wall targeting domains (CWT) of well characterized phage endolysins: PlyG, PlyL and PlyB which bind with species-specificity and high affinity to cell wall components of B. anthracis. Theses CWTs will be fused to specific antitoxin neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to generate Infection Site Targeted Antitoxin antibodies (ISTAbs). ISTAbs are expected to accumulate at the site of infection where they are needed most, and capture and sequester the toxins, thus immediately neutralizing the effects of the toxins and preventing their release into circulation. Bacterium-toxin complex is then expected to be cleared by phagocytes. In this proposal, we will use three anthrax-PA neutralizing monoclonal antibodies fused to high affinity phage endolysin CWTs to generate ISTAbs. In Aim 1 we will screen for best binding CWTs from ten phage endolysins, including those from PlyG, PlyL, and PlyB. We will characterize them based on in vivo and in vitro binding. In Aim 2, based on Aim 1 results, we will select 3 CWTs for generating up to nine ISTAbs by fusing the CWTs with three highly neutralizing anti-Anthrax monoclonal antibody as scaffold and characterize them for in vitro binding and toxin neutralizing activity. In Aim 3 we will further characterize the selected ISTAbs based on stability; bacterial cell binding specificity and affinity, and performance in opsonophagocytic killing assays. In Aim 4, we will perform efficacy testing in pre-challenge and post challenge treatment mouse models and also explore potential immunogenicity of the ISTAbs. Since ISTAb technology provides two therapeutic advantages: immediate toxin neutralization at the site of infection and opsonophagocytic killing by phagocyte, there is a high probability that these molecules will synergize with existing antibiotics. The combination of immediate toxin clearance, phagocytic killing, and concurrent use of antibiotics is expected to create synergy and yield a treatment that is far superior to the current standard of vaccine plus antibiotics. Furthermore, this technology can be applied to a variety of other bacterial pathogens where toxins play a key role in pathogenesis. Overall, this approach has board application as a platform technology across multiple pathogens."
"9235499","PROJECT SUMMARY Background and significance: Features of the built environment and the availability of specific community resources constrain individuals? choices and thus may contribute to the adoption and maintenance of health- promoting behaviors, such as eating healthy diets and engaging in physical activity, that in turn may affect downstream biological (e.g., BMI) and clinical outcomes (e.g., cardiovascular disease). New technologies have rapidly increased the ability to link databases with geo-referenced information on environmental features to individual-level health data, thereby exponentially propelling research that examines associations between the built environment and health. This linked information is highly relevant to clinical practice, making it feasible to tailor interventions and treatments; and to novel study designs that use large databases, such as electronic health records, to investigate the joint effects of built environment factors and individual susceptibility on a range of health and health care outcomes. These linked data are also important for building evidence to support emerging urban design strategies that seek to create environments that promote health. However, methodological challenges, including exposure assessment and selection biases, make it difficult to identify the true impact of the built environment on individual behaviors, and the consequent ability to design place-based interventions to improve health. Objectives, innovation: This project uses data from a state of the art longitudinal study and methods that address residential self-selection, and develops and applies innovative approaches to address measurement challenges. The project will: (1a) estimate the geographic and temporal scales that are relevant for the effects of time-varying availability of community resources and built environment features on repeated measures of health behaviors, biological and clinical outcomes, and (1b) quantify differences in geographic and temporal scales across individuals and specific mechanisms; (2) develop and apply novel methods to ascertain and quantify exposures to multiple, complex environmental features, and assess their simultaneous impact on health indicators; (3) quantify the impact of measurement error in existing large scale built environment databases on estimated associations. The proposed analytical tools will be made freely available through R software packages, and results will be disseminated to multiple audiences, including urban planners. Impact: Results from this project will (a) increase precision in the translation, interpretation and evidence synthesis of past, current, and future studies of built environment health effects; (b) provide scientists with specific guidance on how to standardize measures of the built environment, and incorporate them into large scale individual-level health databases (e.g., electronic health records); and (c) inform best practices for the next generation of research on the impact of the built environment on population health. The project will result in approaches to more accurately and comprehensively measure the impact of multiple environmental factors on health."

"9405952","Project Summary. The broad, long-term objectives of this research are to understand the properties of glutathione transferase Z1 (GSTZ1) and its role in the elimination of the investigational drug dichloroacetic acid (DCA) across the human lifespan. This is important because while DCA, an inhibitor of mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, has therapeutic benefits as a metabolic regulator in treating lactic acidosis, certain solid tumors and pulmonary arterial hypertension, it exhibits marked age- and genetics- related individual variability in pharmacokinetics that are linked to DCA's side effects. The first step in DCA metabolism is dechlorination to glyoxylate, catalyzed by GSTZ1. Also known as maleylacetoacetate isomerase, GSTZ1 plays an important physiological role in isomerizing endogenous reactive metabolites of the tyrosine catabolism pathway, maleylacetoacetate and maleylacetone. GSTZ1 is expressed chiefly in the liver, but also in kidney, intestine, brain and heart. It is the only enzyme known to catalyze the dehalogenation of DCA to its primary metabolite, glyoxylate. Although it is well recognized that DCA inhibits its own metabolism as well as that of its endogenous substrates, through inactivation of GSTZ1, the reasons for the marked individual variability in pharmacokinetics of DCA after repeated doses are only partially understood. Most adults clear repeated doses of DCA more slowly than children, and clearance is GSTZ1 haplotype dependent in children and adults. There is preliminary evidence that extrahepatic sites of DCA metabolism become of greater importance relative to liver following DCA treatment, and that this is age-dependent. Finally, chloride (Cl-) concentration affects the rate of inactivation of GSTZ1 by DCA in a haplotype-dependent manner; the much lower [Cl-] in mitochondria compared with cytosol is thought to be a factor in the more rapid inactivation of the mitochondrial matrix enzyme, and could be a factor in the observed age-dependent differences, as intracellular [Cl-] varies with age. The mechanism of how Cl- protects GSTZ1 from DCA-dependent inactivation is not known. This application seeks to examine reasons for age- and genetics- related changes in expression and activity of GSTZ1 in people. Three specific aims are proposed. The first specific aim will study the role of microRNA (miR) in regulating the documented age-related changes in hepatic GSTZ1 expression. This aim will use banked human liver of different aged donors to identify miRs, and cell-based systems to verify involvement. The second specific aim will investigate the mechanism of protection of GSTZ1 from inactivation by DCA in the presence of Cl- and certain other anions, and the influence of haplotype. Expressed recombinant GSTZ1A and 1B will be crystallized and the binding sites of DCA and anions studied. The third specific aim will use juvenile and adult rats as models of children and adults to examine the roles of extrahepatic tissues relative to liver in the expression and activity of GSTZ1 following multiple DCA doses, to mimic the clinical use."
"9383154","Project 1: PI: D.K.C. Cooper (Abstract)   Experimental xenotransplantation (xenoTx), in the form of pig organ transplantation (Tx) in nonhuman  primates, has made major advances during the past 10 years since this NIAID funding mechanism was  introduced. The problems of early immune rejection and coagulation dysregulation have been greatly reduced,  but there is increasing evidence that an inflammatory response may be activating the immune system and/or  amplifying coagulation dysfunction.   The overall hypothesis that will be investigated in Project 1 is that an inflammatory response plays a  significant role in pig kidney and heart graft failure after Tx into baboons, and that its prevention or suppression  will result in prolonged graft survival. The mechanisms whereby anti-inflammatory agents prolong graft  survival, e.g., by reducing the innate or adaptive immune response, or by minimizing coagulation dysfunction,  will be comprehensively investigated. The current proposal will therefore aim to confirm that the combination of  (i) unique multi-gene pigs (i.e., pigs with 6 or 7 genetic modifications to protect their tissues from the primate  immune response and from the effects of coagulation dysregulation), (ii) an effective immunosuppressive (IS)  regimen, and (iii) a targeted anti-inflammatory regimen will, together, allow consistent function of life-supporting  pig kidneys and hearts for >6 months in the absence of rejection or coagulopathy.   In Aim 1 (investigated in Pittsburgh), we will explore the effect of selected anti-inflammatory agents on  life-supporting kidney graft survival in baboons receiving kidneys from multi-gene pigs and using the proven IS  regimen (developed during the present 5-year funding period). If the expected outcome is not consistently  achieved, we will transplant kidneys from pigs (available to us in 2016-17) expressing different / additional  transgenes that might prove advantageous.   In Aim 2 (NHLBI), in the heterotopic (non-life-supporting) heart Tx model we shall investigate whether  all components of the previously successful IS regimen are essential or whether, after the Tx of a heart from a  multi-gene pig (+/- an effective anti-inflammatory regimen), the IS regimen can be minimized, or  anticoagulation omitted, thus reducing the risks of long-term therapy, e.g., opportunistic infection or bleeding.  Promising approaches will be evaluated in a life-supporting orthotopic model.   The proposed studies are innovative in several respects ? (i) unique novel multi-gene pigs, (ii) the  subsequent availability of further pigs with possibly advantageous genetic manipulations, (iii) investigation of  the role of the inflammatory response in xenoTx. Success in the proposed studies would enable clinical trials of  kidney and heart xenoTx as a first step to eliminate current reliance on deceased human organs, making organ  Tx available to a greatly expanded number of patients."
"9349043","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The circadian clock regulates physiology and behavior and impinges on many aspects of our daily life. Nowhere is this more obvious than control of the sleep wake cycle, where clock genes have been shown to play a role in both the timing of sleep and its quality. For example, mutations in PER2 cause familial advanced sleep phase syndrome (FASPS), while mutations in  CSNK1E and CSNK1D cause FASPS and delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS),  respectively. However, while we have learned much about the clock and how it regulates sleep, the picture is incomplete. Behavioral studies in mice and studies in human cells show that dozens to hundreds of loci impact circadian clock function. However, only a dozen genes have been investigated for their roles in regulating behavior. Testing dozens to hundreds of mice isn't practical, so a new approach is needed. Here we seek to address this gap with a novel strategy that uses, i) integrative bioinformatics to prioritize putative core clock factors, ii) new experimental methods to determine whether they interact with known clock genes and regulate clock function in several cellular or tissue slice models, and, finally, iii) for a subset of promising candidates, generate mouse models and test them for their roles in regulating circadian behavior and sleep. Completion of this research will improve our understanding of circadian rhythms and sleep and may point the way to new therapeutic targets for related disorders in humans."
"9269825","Project Abstract There is a profoundly disproportionate HIV burden that exists among young black men who have sex with men (YBMSM). Substance use has been inextricably linked to HIV transmission since the beginning of the epidemic. Black Americans report the highest levels of discrimination due to race/ethnicity, poverty, and substance use and these discriminatory experiences are likely to increase their risk for HIV infection. Informed by Minority Stress Theory (Meyer, 1995), the proposed 1-year study will support additional data analyses to test the minority stress model for alcohol and other drug use among 1565 YBMSM at high-risk for HIV. Aim 1: Examine the relationship between stressful experiences of racism, homophobia, and internalized homophobia and the use of alcohol and other drugs among YBMSM. Aim 2: Determine if resiliency, gay pride/self-esteem, and social support moderate the relationship between stressful experiences of racism, homophobia, and internalized homophobia and the use of alcohol and other drugs among YBMSM. Aim 3: Assess for the moderating effect of gay pride/self-esteem, resiliency and social support on the relationship between stressful experiences of racism, homophobia, and internalized homophobia and sexual risk behavior. The proposed study will have important scientific, clinical, and public health implications. a) Scientific: This study will advance our basic understanding of resiliency processes that are relevant to preventing/reducing substance use among YBMSM. b) Clinical: Findings from this study will inform our efforts to adapt substance abuse interventions so that they focus on increasing resiliency among YBMSM. c) Public Health: Resiliency factors that may combat the negative affect that arises from multiple discriminatory could inform the implementation of substance abuse prevention campaigns. Findings will also support the provision of resiliency based mental health and substance abuse treatment to address the elevated prevalence of substance use among this most vulnerable sub-group of MSM."
"9289179","PROJECT SUMMARY  Because of its close phylogenetic relationship to the human, the non-human primate (NHP) brain holds enormous potential for understanding structure, function, development and pathology of the human brain. However, many obstacles impede studies of NHPs, among these, significant logistic, ethical, and financial burdens. The Department of Neuroscience at Yale houses a unique collection of brain tissue from NHP macaques, ranging in age from embryonic to adult, which was generated over four decades, in the laboratories of Dr. Pasko Rakic and the late Dr. Patricia Goldman-Rakic. The collection includes four Case Sets of slides: (1) [3H]thymidine-labeled serially cut brains for cell birth dating, (2) brains labeled with tritiated amino acids for tract tracing, (3) brains from monkeys with enucleations and selected cortical lesions, (4) and brains from prenatally X-irradiated and ultrasound-exposed monkeys sacrificed postnatally. A 5th Case Set is comprised of EM blocks from multiple brain regions of fetal and postnatal monkeys. The objective of this grant is to make this unique collection an international research resource (MacBrainResource) that is readily available to the neuroscience community at-large. To accomplish this, we propose (1) to inventory and catalogue the collection, (2) to restore the slides to optimal condition by re-coverslipping and in some instances re-staining them, (3) to publicize the resource via mailings, presentations at the Society for Neuroscience meetings and our website (MacBrainResource.org), and (4) to facilitate use of MacBrainResource by outside investigators both on site and remotely by transmission of high resolution images via the internet. The value of the MacBrainResource collection is immeasurable. Primate brain research not only requires animal sacrifice but is very expensive. Making existing NHP brain tissue available will avoid costly duplication of experiments and unnecessary sacrifice of animals. With increasing pressure to find alternatives to primate research, establishment of the MacBrainResource would allow researchers worldwide to conduct primate studies without the need to sacrifice a single new animal. Proof that this resource represents a viable and valuable alternative for de novo primate research comes from the publication of several recent papers that utilized this material (e.g. Duque at al., 2011; 2015; 2016; Ratnanather et al. 2013; Selemon et al., 2013) as well as demand for material from investigators all over that world. Dedicated personnel, proper cataloguing, and adequate equipment would ensure that these slides and EM blocks are preserved for future generations of neuroscientists to exploit, perhaps using methods not yet developed."
"9393827","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in the United States. Twin and family-based studies have demonstrated a strong genetic contribution to a wide-array of CVD-related traits. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of genetic variants associated with CVD-related traits such as body mass index, lipid levels and hypertension. In aggregate these associated genetic variants explain only a small proportion of the overall genetic contribution to these traits. The interplay between genes and environmental exposures is likely to play a substantial role in explaining away some of these missing trait heritabilities. GWAS studies have largely ignored this consideration, despite the growing empirical evidence that such interactions are important. One major limitation has been that statistical power to detect these interactions is severely limited by the added complexity and dimensionality of studying such interactions. High multiple-test corrected significance thresholds from studying pair-wise interactions require interaction effects to be considerable and the sample size of the study cohort to be very large. In this study, we propose to apply a novel approach to reduce the dimensionality of this interaction problem. Prior to testing specific interactions, we propose to first identify a reduced set of variants that demonstrate some evidence, based on heteroscedasticity of genotype effects, for being subject to interaction. We also propose to use our unique knowledge of the public NHGRI genetic database dbGaP to identify, harmonize and combine genetic, phenotypic and environmental exposure data across large relevant genetic-epidemiological studies to increase our statistical power. The goal of this study is to identify important GxE interactions that impact CVD in order to provide greater insight into the molecular mechanisms of the disease and facilitate more targeted and more effective intervention strategies."
"9244849","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Schizophrenia is a debilitating neurological disorder with a world-wide prevalence of 1%. There is a strong genetic component with an estimated heritability of 80-85%. In the last decade, there has been unprecedented progress in identifying schizophrenia susceptibility genes, but the effect sizes of individual genes have been meager. Earlier studies have suggested that a primate and brain selective isoform (3.1) of the KCNH2 potassium channel is a factor in the brain dysfunction associated with schizophrenia. However, the critical molecular, cellular and neural network mechanisms related to KCNH2-3.1 and their relationship to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia are largely unknown. A KCNH2-3.1 isoform transgenic mouse has recently been made. This study defines the role of KCNH2-3.1 in the development of schizophrenia related cortical circuits, and illuminates critical issues in the time course of schizophrenia and provides support for a clinically important early treatment strategy and drug development.  To test the central hypothesis that KCNH2-3.1 represents a key element not only for acute changes in cell firing patterns but also for long-term aberrant neurobiology by enhancing intrinsic neuronal vulnerability and the formation of impaired neural connections, the following three specific aims will be carried out: (1) In vitro electrophysiologicl and imaging studies of tissues taken from animal with extensive behavioral and cognitive phenotype will identify whether deficits in both sustained neuronal firing and neuronal synchronized activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) contribute to working memory deficits in the KCNH2-3.1 mice. Neuronal sustained firing and synchronized activity in the PFC are thought to reflect the cellular mechanisms critical for working memory dysfunction, which is considered to be a core feature of schizophrenia. (2) In vitro brain slices prepared from animals with extensive behavioral and cognitive phenotypes will be examined to determine whether behavioral deficits in these mice as adults reflect long-term dysfunction of neuronal structural plasticity in the PFC and hippocampus. (3) Telemetric EEG recording, the pHluorin assay and Inscopix's miniature in vivo brain imaging technology will be applied to determine whether selective impairments in neural connections between hippocampus and mPFC develop in these mice, as has also been implicated in schizophrenia.  In addition, this work will answer the following questions: what are the time window changes in altering dendritic spines of prefrontal cortex and hippocampus described in these mice? What time window is best for antipsychotic drugs intervention? Which intracellular signaling pathways are involved in KCNH2-3.1-mediated structural plasticity and working memory deficits? Answers to these questions will identify targets for early therapeutic intervention that may be an effective way to avoid progressive synaptic structural and behavioral deterioration in patients with schizophrenia. The neural circuit studies in mutant KCNH2-3.1 mice will also be important and necessary for developing new drug treatments based on causation rather than phenomenology."
"9288606","Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) infected erythrocytes can activate endothelial and other myeloid cells, culminating in systemic inflammation and vascular dysfunction that underlie the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria. A subset of the polymorphic Pf Erythrocyte Membrane Protein 1 (PfEMP1) family, a virulence protein exported from the intracellular parasite to the infected erythrocyte surface, is overrepresented in persons with cerebral malaria, who also have elevated levels of circulating immune complexes that can modify endothelial and monocyte function. Members of the Kruppel-like family of factors (KLF) are nodal regulators of endothelial and immune cell function. KLF2 confers an anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic, and anti- permeable phenotype to endothelial and myeloid cells by a common mechanism centered on inhibition of NF?B, a key transcriptional inducer of pro-inflammatory activation. However, a causal link between malaria pathogenesis and KLF2 regulation, brain endothelial cell and monocyte function, and malaria elicited immune complexes has not been established. Our central hypothesis is that regulation of KLF2 levels in endothelial and myeloid cells is critical for the pathogenesis of vascular and monocyte dysfunction in cerebral malaria, and that this myeloid cell dysfunction results from interactions with infected erythrocytes expressing specific PfEMP1s and Pf elicited immune complexes. To test this hypothesis, we will enroll Kenyan children presenting with cerebral and uncomplicated malaria and follow them for 6 months. We will examine 1) the impact of PfEMP1 and patient parasite isolates on endothelial KLF2 and NF?B expression, 2) patient monocyte phenotype, function, KLF2 expression, and in vitro monocyte function impacted by PfEMP1 and patient parasite isolates, and 3) the role of immune complexes in vascular endothelial and monocyte dysfunction isolated from children with cerebral and uncomplicated malaria. Research proposed here will inform the rational development of adjunct therapies aimed at reducing vascular dysfunction, mortality and long- term clinical sequela of cerebral malaria by enhancing endogenous cytoprotective pathways of endothelial/myeloid lineage cells."
"9388433","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescent marijuana use is a prominent public health concern. Indeed, exposure to marijuana during adolescence is correlated with drug abuse and addiction in adulthood and predicts future cocaine abuse. Changing national attitudes on marijuana use and the resultant push for the reform of marijuana laws (23 states and the District of Columbia currently have legalized marijuana in some form) highlight a need to examine the long-term neurobiological consequences of cannabinoid exposure. I have collected preliminary data showing that adolescent exposure to a cannabinoid agonist disrupts the experience of cocaine reward in adulthood and results in cocaine-induced conditioned place aversion. These data confirm the work of others showing that cannabinoid exposure in adolescence disturbs normal brain development and produces lasting effects on behavior. In this study, we intend to utilize cutting-edge electrochemical and optogenetic techniques to investigate the effects of cannabinoid exposure in adolescence on cocaine experience and reinforcement in adulthood. Specific aim 1 utilizes pharmacological manipulations to determine if cannabinoid exposure in adolescence exerts its effects on adult cocaine experience through actions at CB1 receptors. In the same animals we will employ the electrochemical technique fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to measure whether cannabinoid exposure during adolescence changes subsecond dopamine release evoked by cocaine and cocaine-associated contextual cues and assess how cannabinoid exposure affects the initiation and escalation of cocaine self-administration. Specific aim 2 uses optogenetic tools to test whether cannabinoids alter cocaine experience through disruption of dopaminergic function. Altogether these experiments will provide novel information concerning the neural mechanisms through which cannabinoid exposure in adolescence disturbs brain development and influences cocaine reward and reinforcement in adulthood."

"9230752","PROJECT SUMMARY Fluorescent organic nanoparticles (FONPs) are a relatively new class of imaging probes that have unique potential for biomedical imaging applications because they integrate the synthetic flexibility of small organic molecules with the superior fluorescence properties of nanoparticles. FONPs have notable distinctions, however, compared to other types of fluorescent materials. Compared to the majority of organic dye fluorophores that display quenched fluorescence when aggregated, the fluorescent monomers that comprise FONPs have increased signal upon their self-assembly. Relative to other types of fluorescent NPs, such as quantum dots, FONPs have high quantum yield, can be optimized for size, color, and surface coating, and do not require the use of toxic elements. These factors taken together suggest that FONPs have great potential as a platform imaging technology. Indeed, FONPs have been used experimentally for tumor detection, apoptosis assessment, and cell tracking. Despite these early successes, significant innovations must be made to precisely control optical properties including wavelength and brightness, FONP self-assembly and overall size, and development of an easily adaptive surface coating for conjugation specific to the intended application. Thus, the overarching goal of this IMAT R21 proposal is to synthesize, characterize, and evaluate a new class of fluorescent organic nanoparticles (FONPs) as a novel imaging agents with controlled size, emission wavelengths, surface chemistry, and high quantum yield for diverse cancer imaging applications. Further, we hypothesize that FONPs with tunable fluorescence emission, size minimization, paramagnetic cores, and a clickable surface coating will provide targetable nanoparticle-based technology with bright and stable fluorescence emission for multiplexed and multimodality imaging. The goals, hypothesis, and innovation are addressed in two specific aims: (1) To design clickable, optically tuned, self-assembled fluorescent organic nanoparticles; (2) To validate the capacity of FONPs for multiplexed cellular imaging to differentiate inflammatory and tumor-associated neurolymphatic remodeling. Using neurolymphatic remodeling as the first application of the FONPs serves multiple purposes. It necessitates synthesizing distinct colors of FONPs for simultaneous imaging of more than one cell population, requires at least two types of ?clickable? targeting ligands, and allows for a quantifiable comparison with fluorescent protein-labeled cells and ligands conjugated to either small organic dyes or QDs. Finally, the 2D, 3D, and ex vivo results obtained with this proposal will provide additional insight into distinguishing inflammation from tumorigenesis using FONPs as a platform technology. If the quantitative milestones of this IMAT R21 are achieved, it will directly support their continued preclinical and clinical development."
"9260341","Virtually every form of progressive heart failure (HF) is associated with increased fibrosis. Currently there is no approved therapy to specifically target myocardial fibrosis in the diseased heart. Until very recently, HF studies have been largely limited to cardiomyocytes, primarily due to unavailability of cardiac fibroblast (CF)-specific mouse models. Recently, we used novel CF-specific mouse models to demonstrate that deletion of CF-GSK- 3? is detrimental in the ischemic heart. This successful utilization of CF-specific gene targeting provides a unique opportunity to further employ these newly optimized models to understand the role of CFs and their activation in myocardial disease process in vivo. The long-term goal of the proposed studies is to identify new therapeutic targets for the treatment of myocardial fibrosis and subsequent HF. Three specific aims are designed to identify the key signaling pathways and underlying primary mechanisms responsible for regulation of myocardial fibrosis. Aim 1: To elucidate the molecular mechanism by which CF-GSK-3? regulates fibrotic remodeling in the ischemic heart. The GSK-3 family consists of two isoforms, ? and ?. In stark contrast to our recent report with GSK-3?, our preliminary studies suggest that CF-specific deletion of GSK-3? is protective, post-MI. Based on this observation we hypothesize that CF-GSK-3? is deleterious in the process of post MI fibrotic remodeling. This hypothesis will be tested by employing CF-GSK-3? KO (periostin-cre) and tamoxifen- inducible fibroblast specific GSK-3? KO (TCF21-cre) mouse models. Aim 2: To define the molecular mechanisms by which CF-specific deletion of GSK-3? leads to adverse myocardial fibrosis. We hypothesize that GSK-3?, SMAD-3 and ?-catenin function as an integrated central profibrotic signaling cascade. We will cross our GSK-3?fl/fl mice with SMAD-3fl/fl and ?-cateninfl/fl mice to determine whether inhibition of the SMAD-3 and ?-catenin axis is sufficient to abolish myocardial fibrosis in GSK-3?KO mice. Aim 3: Determine the mechanisms by which Integrin ?1?1 (ITG?1?1) cross-talks with the profibrotic SMAD-3 and p38 pathways and identify the role of this interaction in regulation of myocardial fibrosis. Our preliminary data suggest that mechanical stretch couples to SMAD-3 activation even in the absence of TGF-?1 treatment. The predominant integrin expressed in CFs is ITG?1?1. In this aim, we will test the hypothesis that ITG?1?1 negatively regulates the TGF-?1/SMAD-3 and p38 pathways and thus exerts a critical break on myocardial fibrotic remodeling. The proposed approach is innovative, because it departs from status quo by utilizing novel CF- specific loss of function mouse models and isolated cells from them to understand the molecular mechanism of myocardial fibrosis in diseased heart. New research horizons are expected to become attainable as a result. The proposed research is highly significant, since it proposes novel strategies to prevent fibrotic remodeling in diseased heart."
"9412583","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatic insulin resistance due to obesity is central to the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This research proposal addresses the unanswered question of how molecular mechanisms that normally promote energy conservation contribute to NAFLD in obese individuals. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the regulatory relationships between cellular lipid molecules and metabolism, particularly as they present therapeutic opportunities. The objective of this research is to understand fundamental new mechanisms for the regulation of energy homeostasis and nutrient metabolism. The central hypothesis is that thioesterase superfamily member 1 (Them1) functions in brown adipose tissue (BAT) as a lipid-regulated fatty acyl-CoA thioesterase that controls intracellular fatty acid trafficking and that regulates the expression of thermogenic genes. In the setting of obesity, we postulate that upregulation of Them1 in liver and white adipose tissue promotes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation due to the overproduction of free fatty acids. The rationale is that the mechanisms of Them1-mediated metabolic regulation should yield new insights into the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Guided by extensive preliminary data, the central hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: 1) To determine the mechanisms whereby Them1 limits energy expenditure in BAT; 2) To demonstrate a primary pathogenic role for Them1 in NAFLD; and 3) To elucidate molecular regulation of Them1 activity by the lipid-binding steroidogenic acute regulatory protein-related lipid transfer (START) domain. In Aim 1, recently developed Them1-/- mice and cultured brown adipocytes will be used to test the hypothesis that Them1 in BAT limits access of fatty acids to mitochondria and reduces the expression of thermogenic genes. Aim 2 will leverage newly created transgenic mice, as well as cell culture systems to explore whether Them1 contributes directly to hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. Mice with liver-specific overexpression will be used to establish the role of Them1 in promoting hepatic ER stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation. Mice with adipose-specific overexpression will reveal the contributions of Them1 to inflammation within white adipose tissue and to hepatic steatosis. Aim 3 will determine the lipid ligand(s) of the Them1 START domain by mass spectrometry. X-ray crystallography will be used to determine the structure of Them1 in complex with its ligands, the relationship among functional domains and the influence of lipid binding on enzymatic activity. High throughput screening will identity small molecule inhibitors, which should facilitate structure-function studies and help delineate the biological roles of Them1. Overall, this proposal will elucidate Them1-mediated metabolic regulation, which is significant because mechanisms that conserve energy in health may promote disease under conditions of overnutrition. These studies are expected to identify new therapeutic targets for the management of NAFLD."
"9223225","Project  Summary/Abstract  The goal of the proposed research program is to investigate how the endothelial  cells  that comprise our vasculature are assigned arterial fate, and thus constitute  the  arterial  vascular system, in parallel with the venous and lymphatic systems. As de-regulation of arteriovenous fate can result in a myriad of vascular disorders, the work aims to understand how arterial identity is acquired, regulated, and maintained. The work will elucidate novel regulatory pathways of transcriptional control during the arterial specification program, and it will allow new potential therapeutic targets for vascular disorders. This proposal is for a five-year career development program designed to prepare Dr. Carlos Lizama for an independent scientific academic career studying the biology and regulation of the arterial specification program. The project will build on Dr. Lizama's background in hematovascular development, while expanding his research skills into new avenues of transcriptional regulation and protein-DNA interactions. The training program will take place under the guidance of Dr. Lizama's co-mentors Drs. Ann Zovein and Dean Sheppard who will oversee his scientific progress while preparing him for the transition to an independent career. The proposal will allow Dr. Lizama to develop his independent line of research focused on understanding the signaling pathways that control arterial specification and maintenance. The preliminary work has identified an important role for the TGFß1 pathway in controlling the arterial identity. Dr. Lizama will follow up on his initial observations and test the hypothesis that the TGFß superfamily plays an integral role in arterial specification, as well as in the hematopoietic switch in hemogenic endothelium. He will determine the existence of transcriptional protein complexes that connect the TGFß pathway to the SoxF transcriptional regulators of arterial fate. The proposed program will provide critical insights into vascular biology while transitioning Dr. Lizama to an independent faculty position and establishing his unique research program in arterial gene regulation."
"9220778","DESCRIPTION: In the era of effective antiretroviral therapy, treated HIV-infected adults have a greater risk of non-AIDS related morbidity, which includes cardiovascular disease, neurocognitive disease, osteoporosis, liver disease, kidney disease, and some cancers. Among the factors that contribute to the risk of non-AIDS complications are antiretroviral drug toxicity,a high prevalence of traditional risk factors (such as substance abuse, obesity, and hypertension), and immune dysfunction and inflammation. In fact, illicit drug use remains the second most common mode of exposure to HIV among AIDS cases nationwide, representing 31% of total diagnoses. In addition to drug use as a factor in initial exposure to HIV, ongoing drug use, correlates of the lifestyles associated with drug use, and lack of access and adherence to treatments for drug use and HIV infection are among the related factors that exacerbate disease progression. In particular, the gastrointestinal tract and its resultant loss of barrier function i a major target for acute HIV infection and drugs of abuse, leading to the occurrence of ischemic lesions secondary to inflammation. Thus, negative synergy between HIV infection and drug use impacting intestinal permeability is central to this proposal. Currently the therapeutic focus for the HIV-infected population is on (i) improved antiretroviral compounds, (ii) cure-based strategies directed at the latent viral reservoir, and (iii) anti-inflammatory, probiotic, antibiotc, and anti-coagulation treatments that target systemic immune activation and hypercoagulability. This application outlines an entirely distinct molecular and cellular target for HIV treatment - repairing the intestinal barrier defect. We reason that HIV- and illicit drug-mediated breakdown in the intestinal mucosa leads to chronic exposure to translocated microbial products, which drive systemic inflammation. These subtle elevations in both inflammatory and coagulation biomarkers are associated with dramatic and sustained increases in risk of all-cause morbidity and mortality in HIV. We therefore propose an innovative three-tiered research strategy to alter the conversation in the HIV scientific community, informed by the augmentation in intestinal damage due to the joint insult of HIV infection and use of illicit drugs. (i) We will define in vito the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which mucosal T cell depletion, accompanied by the preferential decrease in IL-17 and IL-22 production, antiretroviral drug toxicity, morphogenetic patterning (by the Wnt, Notch, and hedgehog pathways), enterocyte apoptosis, and lamina propria fibrosis (due to HIV infection) and intestinal ischemic damage (due to drug use) combine to increase intestinal permeability (IP) via a loss in epithelial integrity and homeostasis. (ii) Working in vivo in the SIV primate model, we will test directly the ability of exogenous IL-17 and IL-22 to decrease intestinal permeability, reduce systemic inflammation, and possibly alter the disease course. Finally, (iii) we will test our hypothesis that focusing on epithelial repair is a transformative approach to HIV- and illicit drug-promoted mucosal damage, by initiating a pilot clinical study with human Growth Hormone (hGH) as the therapeutic and a reduction of intestinal permeability, a decline in circulating microbial products, and a decrease in biomarkers of hypercoagulability and inflammation, as the clinical endpoints. We hope to establish a new paradigm in which we expect to identify novel therapeutic strategies to heal the breached epithelium, and subsequently stem the translocation of microbial products, minimize systemic inflammation, and treat the HIV-infected drug user."
"9429434","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is a competing renewal for our longstanding Stanford Radiology cancer-imaging T32 training program. Drs. Sandy Napel, PhD, and Graham Sommer, MD, will lead this program, featuring 23 mentors with independent cancer-focused or -related funding, and 7 (5 internal / 2 external) distinguished program advisors. To reflect our expanded focus, now comprising cancer imaging, image-based cancer characterization, and image-guided cancer treatment, we have changed the program name to Stanford Cancer Imaging Training (SCIT) Program, a 2-year program training 5 fellows (roughly half PhD / half MD) per year over a 5 year funding cycle. Our strengthened required coursework component includes 2 courses in the clinical/cancer sciences, 2 in imaging science, 1 in biostatistics, 1 in medical ethics (Responsible Conduct of Research), and attendance at a minimum of 6 multidisciplinary tumor boards. In addition, trainees can select from a multitude of electives offered by various Stanford University Departments, e.g., Radiology, Radiation Oncology, Bioengineering, Biomedical Informatics, and Cancer Systems Biology. Primary focus is participation in a mentored cancer-imaging research project aimed at publication in peer-reviewed journals, and presentation at National meetings. We especially feature paired mentorship, in which each trainee is teamed with both a basic-science and physician mentor, to provide guidance in course and research-topic selection. Our mission has been, and continues to be, to train the next generation of researchers in the development and clinical translation of advanced techniques for cancer imaging and its application. In addition, we will recruit our trainees from a nationwide pool including women, candidates from underrepresented minorities or with disabilities, and from disadvantaged backgrounds, so as to increase diversity in the US research workforce.  The need for SCIT is even greater now than when it began in 1993. Since our 2006 application, the field of radiology has dramatically changed and now, more than ever, plays a key role in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients. Our Department is one of the very few that has been able to grow in response to this need and embrace what is now a multidisciplinary vision towards image-based cancer research. SCIT will leverage four existing NIH centers of excellence at Stanford: the In Vivo Cellular and Molecular Imaging Center (ICMIC), the Center for Cancer Nanotechnology Excellence and Translation (CCNE-T), the Center for Advanced Magnetic Resonance Technology (CAMRT), and the Stanford Center for Cancer Systems Biology (CCSB). Since 1993, we have successfully graduated 32 postdoctoral (MD or PhD) trainees, all of whom were productive during their tenure in the program and many who continue academic activity in cancer imaging today. The 4 current trainees are pursuing research in MR imaging of breast cancer, angiogenesis imaging with nanoparticles, developing MR probes for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, and cultivating advanced instrumentation for CT and molecular imaging of cancer."
"9208169","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is a dominantly-inherited, untreatable neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive ataxia and Purkinje cell degeneration associated with CAG repeat expansions in the gene, CACNA1A. Our recent evidence suggests that the disease is attributable to expression of a polyQ repeat expansion within a second CACNA1A gene product, a1ACT, that normally serves as a transcription factor (TF) critical for cerebellar cortical development, and that arises through the action of a cryptic cellular internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) within the coding region. SCA6-sized polyQ expansions in the ?1ACT TF interrupt its cellular and molecular function, cause cell death in vitro, ataxia and cortical thinning. The long-term goal of this project is to understand te pathogenesis of SCA6 by characterizing how a1ACTSCA6 alters gene expression, by confirming the role of the CACNA1A IRES in vivo and by developing a screening strategy for potential IRES-inhibiting compounds as potential therapies. Specifically we propose to ask: 1. Does the SCA6 polyQ expansion in a1ACT in the transcription factor (a1ACTSCA6) changes the gene binding patterns and the expression patterns of Purkinje cell genes? We will utilize chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to analyze in detail binding profiles of a1ACTWT and a1ACTSCA6 expressed in PC12 cells and isolate RNA from Purkinje cells of mice expressing a1ACTWT or a1ACTSCA6 to generate global gene expression profiles by RNA-seq to correlate a1ACTWT-DNA binding with transcriptional activity and to identify allele-specific changes in gene expression patterns. 2. Does a1ACT expression by CACNA1A IRES and promoter reproduce the normal and pathological functions of ?1ACT? We will generate new lines of a1ACT transgenic mice that will only yield a1ACTWT or a1ACTSCA6 protein by CAP-independent translation, and use the tet-off expression system to drive conditional expression and use a CACNA1A-tTA transgene to generate an endogenous pattern of expression. 3. Can we identify IRES-directed molecules that selectively suppress ?1ACT translation, but not a1A subunit expression? We will use our dual-luciferase bicistronic reporter to determine the optimal RNA sequences involved in IRES function, identify the ITAFs by EMSA and predict the secondary structure of CACNA1A IRES. We will carry out a high throughput screening assay to identify compounds that interfere with ?1ACT IRES function."
"9381292","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): At the end of 2009, there were an estimated 2.1 million children under the age of 15 years living with HIV, with almost 90% residing in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). With increased availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and improved care, increasing numbers of perinatally infected children are surviving into adolescence. There are an estimated 150,000 HIV-infected children in Uganda. While HIV care and treatment programs for children are expanding, a growing challenge facing health providers and caregivers is disclosure of HIV serostatus to infected children. Studies conducted in SSA have indicated that only 2% to 37.8% of HIV-infected children < 15 years know their HIV status. In Uganda, despite the rapid expansion of HIV services for children, very few health providers receive formal training in how to support disclosure of an HIV diagnosis to an infected child. As HIV care and treatment programs for children are scaled up to meet the demand of a growing population of HIV-infected children in SSA, there is an urgent need for effective, cost-effective, culturally appropriate, and scalable disclosure interventions that improve caregivers ability to communicate with their child about chronic illness and HIV, and promote sustained positive mental health, behavioral and clinical outcomes of HIV-infected children who learn their HIV status. We propose a 4-year project to test the effectiveness of a cognitive-behavioral intervention that we have designed to support developmentally appropriate disclosure to HIV-infected children by their caregiver. The intervention is informed by social cognitive theory and the information-motivation-behavior model, and would adapt components of a multi- faceted program for caregivers of HIV-infected children, developed by members of our team with funding support from the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). Our specific aims are: AIM 1: To determine the effectiveness of a cognitive-behavior intervention for increasing disclosure of children's HIV diagnosis by caregivers to their HIV-infected children age 7-12 years old in Uganda. We will evaluate the intervention using a stepped wedge quasi-experiment implemented at four Kampala area HIV clinics, with a total of 400 caregiver-child dyads, and followed for 24 months. We hypothesize that the enhanced intervention will lead to increased disclosure rates. We will compare disclosure among caregiver- child dyads enrolled in the intervention and dyads enrolled in standard care guided by Uganda National guidelines for HIV Care and Treatment. AIM 2: To determine the effect of disclosure on immediate and longer- term caregiver and child mental health, and child behavioral and clinical outcomes, and whether the intervention modifies these effects. We hypothesize that the intervention will attenuate potential adverse effects of disclosure, including depression, anxiety, and behavioral problems. AIM 3: To assess the incremental cost, and cost-effectiveness of the intervention. The findings of this study will inform Ugandan and other countries national policies on pediatric HIV care and treatment."
