"9243987","The Muscle Phenotyping and Imaging Core serves as a resource for both muscle biologists and other life  scientists to employ a variety of assessment tools for the study of muscle phenotypes. With advances in  technologies to create genetically engineered mice, the need for expertise in muscle biology has grown, as  unanticipated muscle phenotypes have resulted from ablation of target genes. Since non-muscle  researchers lack the necessary experience, training and technical instrumentation to accomplish this goal,  the Muscle Phenotyping and Imaging Core fulfills a void that provides a useful resource, which allows nonmuscle  biologists to capitalize on available expertise, specialized protocols and instrumentation.  Furthermore, by lowering barriers for non-muscle scientists to carry out muscle-related studies, by providing  education and an ecosystem of scientists and activities focused on muscle biology, the Core attract new  scientists to the muscle field. Moreover, technological advances now permit the production of vast libraries  of small molecules with potential therapeutic applications, and enable high-throughput, robotic, functional invitro  analysis, to identify drugs to target focused pathways. The High-throughput Screening and Cell  Repository Core (Core B) ofthis application, along with the resources of the UCLA Molecular Screening  Shared Resource (MSSR) provides screening capabilities to UCLA investigators interested in finding  treatments for neuromuscular diseases. A major challenge for translational research lies in the extension of  these in vitro findings to complex mammalian systems in vivo, where experimental outcomes may differ  importantly from observations made on single cell types. This Core provides a means for investigators to  test lead therapeutic compounds in mice and evaluate the effect of these compounds on muscle pathology  and function. In addition to assessing muscle phenotypes using traditional approaches, the Core  emphasizes the development of innovative, non-invasive methodologies, which provide unique resources to  investigate physiological oiJtcomes in longitudinal studies."
"9316211","PROJECT SUMMARY Genomic instabilities drive the progression of cancer, aging, and other human diseases. The integrity of our genome is especially at risk while it is being replicated, as replication forks often encounter obstacles to their progression, including DNA lesions, hard-to-replicate sequences, transcription intermediates, or protein-DNA complexes. These encounters often result in DNA breaks, gross chromosomal rearrangements and aneuploidy, which are key events in cancer initiation. The proper repair of stalled or collapsed replication forks through homologous recombination (HR)-based mechanisms plays a major role in preventing replication stress-induced genomic instabilities and many mutations in components of the HR machinery have been associated with cancer predisposition. In the absence of an intact HR-machinery, error-prone mechanisms such as non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) tend to become hyper-utilized, leading to extensive genomic instability. The regulatory basis of the recruitment of HR and NHEJ factors to DNA lesions is therefore of central interest to genome biology and cancer research, not only for explaining the mechanisms of tumorigenesis, but also for providing promising avenues for cancer therapy, as recently demonstrated for PARP inhibitors that are now approved for treatment of ovarian cancer patients with BRCA1 mutations in Europe and the US. This proposal will investigate a new mechanism for regulation of recombinational DNA repair and repair pathway choice. The central hypothesis is that the evolutionarily conserved scaffolding protein TopBP1 plays a central, yet largely unexplored, role in the control of HR-mediated repair and DNA repair pathway choice. Utilizing biochemical, proteomic and genetic approaches in yeast, human cell lines and genome-edited mice, we will define the molecular mechanism by which TopBP1 and its yeast ortholog Dpb11 control DNA repair. Our studies will provide unparalleled molecular understanding of how the action of key HR and NHEJ factors are coordinated and will reveal how signaling networks integrate the control of DNA replication, checkpoint signaling and DNA repair. Proposed experiments will reveal novel mechanisms of repair pathway choice and recombinational repair that are crucial to suppress genomic instability and cancer. Generated outcomes will have implications in the study of tumorigenesis caused by dysfunctions in HR repair and should provide new rationale for therapy."
"9322073","The Penn Diabetes Research Center (DRC) participates in the nationwide interdisciplinary program established over four decades ago by the NIDDK to foster research in diabetes and related metabolic disorders. The mission of the Penn DRC is to support and develop successful approaches to the prevention, treatment, and cure of diabetes mellitus. Administered by the University of Pennsylvania, the Penn DRC currently serves 127 diabetes-oriented investigators, primarily from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania School but also from other Schools within the University as well as collaborating local institutions including Thomas Jefferson University, Temple University School of Medicine, the Monell Chemical Senses Institute, the Wistar Institute, and Rutgers University. Overall direct costs of $67M support the work of these investigators. The Penn DRC is highly interactive and interdisciplinary, representing many basic science and clinical departments. The Research Base of the Penn DRC is organized in 4 focus groups: 1) Type 1 Diabetes, with a focus on beta cell biology and Pathology; 2) Type 2 Diabetes, focused on signaling by insulin and other hormones; 3) Obesity; and 4) Cardiovascular Metabolism and Complications. The Penn DRC facilitates and supports diabetes research in a variety of ways. Six Biomedical Research Cores facilitate the work of Penn DRC investigators: Functional Genomics Core; Islet Cell Biology Core, Mouse Phenotyping, Physiology, and Metabolism Core; Radioimmunoassay/Biomarkers Core; Transgenic and Chimeric Mouse Core, and Viral Vector Core. Collaborative research and application of emerging technologies to diabetes investigation are further promoted by the Regional Metabolomic Core at Princeton. A Pilot and Feasibility Grant Program that has been highly successful over decades serves to nurture new investigators and to foster new initiatives in diabetes research. A broad and intensive Enrichment Program organizes weekly Diabetes and Endocrinology Research seminars, special events, and an annual Spring Diabetes Symposium, all designed to enhance communication and collaboration of Penn DRC investigators while keeping them abreast of the latest discoveries. Penn DRC investigators mentor trainees at every level (undergraduate, predoctoral, and post-doctoral Ph.D., M.D., and combined M.D./Ph.D.), and the Enrichment Program provides a superb environment for training in diabetes research. The Biomedical Cores, Pilot and Feasibility Grant Program, and Enrichment Program are coordinated and publicized by an Administrative Component that governs the DRC. Its organizational structure, including the Director and Associate Director, Executive Committee, Committee of Core Directors, and external as well as internal advisory boards, functions to maintain the diabetes-related research at the Penn DRC at the forefront of biomedical science."
"9308860","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  The goal of Core D is to provide coherent, comprehensive and cost effective computer software support for all the projects and the other cores. The major areas of support include data management across multiple systems, specialized algorithms and applications for data processing, integration and visualization and sophisticated tools for decision support. Project 1 will investigate individualization of treatments for brain and  head/neck cancers and Project 2 will investigate individualized dose escalation in volume-effect organs.  These studies will involve acquisition of considerable patient specific imaging and clinical response data for the new comprehensive data management framework developed for Project 4. Core D will implement the data management and clinical applications needed to manage and analyze these data that provide the  essential feedback for adaptive planning. Project 3 will investigate methods for acquisition, reconstruction and analysis of physiological imaging data. Core D will implement many of the sophisticated data processing and integration algorithms proposed in that project. As many of these algorithms involve specialized image processing, much of this work will be carried out in close collaboration, with Core C.  Project 4 involves the development of a new comprehensive data framework that will allow accumulation and integration of patient specific data acquired prior to, during, and after treatment. These diverse data include anatomic and physiological imaging information, clinical findings, estimates of delivered dose and bookkeeping for different strategies or study protocols. The new framework will be integrated with our  treatment plan optimization system to form a comprehensive platform for adaptive, patient-specific, treatment design and evaluation management. Project 4 will provide the requirement specifications and use-cases for the new data framework and software developers in Core D will create, test and manage these necessary modules."
"9414888","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses the molecular basis of the liquid-like features of the nucleolus, a membrane-less nuclear organelle that mediates ribosome biogenesis and certain types of stress signaling (e.g., involving p53). The nucleolus exhibits three structural regions, the fibrillar center (FC), dense fibrillar component (DFC), and granular component (GC), that are the locations of various steps in ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and protein processing and assembly during ribosome biogenesis. Recently, Brangwynne, et al., showed that the GC of the nucleolus exhibits liquid-like features, similar to those of other punctate, membrane-less organelles. Furthermore, Brangwynne previously showed that punctate P granules form liquid-like structures through phase separation of their components. More recently, Rosen demonstrated that multi-valency of binding domains and motifs within interacting proteins is associated with phase separation, and McKnight has shown that multi-valent, low complexity protein sequences experience phase separation with RNA. These and other recent studies have given birth to a new area of structural biology: phase separation phenomena that drive formation of membrane-less organelles with liquid-like structural features.  The multi-functional phospho-protein, Nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1; termed Npm here), is a major constituent of the GC of the nucleolus and we hypothesize is a main driver of the phase separation that gives rise to the GC's liquid-like features. We recently described the structure of the pentameric, N-terminal domain of human Npm (N130) and the molecular basis for its interactions with known nucleolar binding partners, including ribosomal proteins. N130 exhibits two acidic tracts, one within its pentamer structure (termed A1) and another within a 10 residue-long disordered C-terminal segment (termed A2); within the N130 pentamer, A1 and A2 create multi-valency. We additionally showed that many of Npm's nucleolar binding partners exhibit disordered regions containing multiple Arg residue-containing motifs (termed R motifs); the multiple R motifs in Npm's binding partners also exhibit multi-valency. In currently unpublished studies, we have shown that N130 forms liquid-like droplets upon binding to various R motif-containing peptides derived from Npm partners. Npm also exhibits a folded nucleic binding domain at its C-terminus, providing an additional level of multi-valency for interactions with rRNA in the nucleolus. We hypothesize that Npm transiently and promiscuously interacts with proteins and rRNA in the nucleolus, nucleating its liquid-like features and organizing the molecular functions that drive ribosome biogenesis."
"9385971","Cryptococcus neoformans is a ubiquitous environmental fungus that is a major cause of disease in immunocompromised patients. Following inhalation, there is propensity for yeast cells to invade the central nervous system, which can result in meningoencephalitis. A central question in the pathogenesis of this fungus is how it adapts to and proliferates in the harsh environment of the human host. Three major virulence factors have been identified: an anti-­phagocytic polysaccharide capsule, antioxidant melanin pigments, and the complex trait of thermotolerance. Preliminary results suggest the existence of an additional virulence factor: increased genetic instability at the human host temperature, which can contribute to rapid adaptation. Temperature-­dependent instability has been observed with cultured yeast cells and, at the two reporter genes examined to date, is due to insertional inactivation by transposable elements (TEs). C. neoformans is estimated to contain ~30 distinct TEs, but these elements have not been well characterized. The goal of the proposed experiments is to define the extent/nature of temperature-­dependent TE mobilization in free-­living yeast cells, and to examine whether similar mobilization occurs in the context of model host systems. Thus far, movement of both a DNA transposon and a retrotransposon has been detected using a single selective agent. Aim 1 will use other selective systems to probe for the mobilization of additional TEs. As the first step in characterizing TE movement on a global scale, Aim 2 will use the long reads produced by PacBio sequencing to annotate all elements in the genome. In Aim 3, transposon-­accumulation lines obtained by sub-­culturing yeast cells will be subjected to whole genome sequencing in order to define the extent of TE movement globally. Finally, Aim 4 will employ three host models (the greater wax moth Galleria mellonella, cultured murine macrophages, and nasally-­infected mice) to document similar TE mobilization in the context of complex fungal-­host interactions. Results obtained from these analyses will provide basic insight into how C. neoformans rapidly adapts to the human host to cause disease, which may in turn inform the development of novel therapeutic interventions.     "
"9279250","PROJECT SUMMARY The sickle hemoglobin mutation afflicts millions of people worldwide and is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. The pathophysiology of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a consequence of abnormal deoxygenated sickle hemoglobin polymerization and its deleterious effects on Red Blood Cell (RBC) membrane, shape, density, deformability, and adhesion. The original powerful observation that sickle red cells show abnormal adhesion to endothelial cells has since been deepened and expanded to describe a complex pathophysiology in which abnormal white blood cell (WBC) adhesion also plays an important role. These studies led to clinical trial development utilizing targeted anti-adhesion therapy. Despite the remarkable insights about abnormal cellular adhesion in SCD that have been made, there remain gaps in knowledge about these complex adhesive interactions. There is no established `atlas' of abnormal adhesive events, examined longitudinally and in a standardized manner in a large heterogeneous population of SCD patients under a range of clinical circumstance and with and without treatment. Neither the topography of adhesive events for an individual patient, nor for the SCD population as a whole is known. Better knowledge of the nature and scope of abnormal adhesive events is critical to the goals of establishing associations with clinical outcomes and successfully identifying therapeutic targets in clinical trials. We have developed a novel microfluidic assay that allows rapid, preprocessing free, and standardized interrogation of RBC and WBC adhesion in whole blood. In our ongoing experiments, high levels of HbF are associated with lesser adhesion, while greater adhesion is associated with hemolysis. In preliminary longitudinal studies, we find that RBC adhesion drops with initiation of treatment, and that levels of adhesion are stable in stably treated patients. Given our preliminary findings, we hypothesize that, in SCD: (1) changes in RBC or WBC adhesion will reflect the subjects' clinical state and treatment response, and (2) that the adhesive profile will change with age, and will differ between children and adults during vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs). To test these hypotheses, we propose the following distinct but interrelated Specific Aims: Aim 1: To standardize the simultaneous baseline evaluation of multiple cellular adhesive properties in a large population of asymptomatic adults and children (at more than one center and longitudinally); Aim 2: To determine the change from baseline in cellular adhesive properties that are present during vaso-occlusive crises, and to analyze these in adult and pediatric populations; and Aim 3: To examine changes in cellular adhesive properties before and after therapeutic interventions, including transfusions, hydroxyurea, and targeted anti- adhesion therapy. Our studies will afford the more precise characterization of abnormal adhesive events in a given individual and a more accurate assessment of response to therapy overall. We would like to make adhesion testing as feasible, and clinically meaningful, in SCD as glucose testing is in diabetes."
"9282613","Developmental Funds: Project Summary/Abstract  Developmental Funds are a critical component of this CCSG. These funds are used to shape the future  Membership of the Koch Institute, to seed future research directions within the four Programs, and to ensure  that the Center's Core Facilities meet the needs of the Membership. Developmental Funds are used in support  of three distinct areas: Faculty Recruitment, Faculty Pilot Projects, and development of new Core Facilities.  The recruitment and support of early career development of new faculty is one of the principal goals of the  CCSG Developmental Funds. Historically, this has been a highly successful use of these funds, which are  leveraged with additional support from MIT. New Investigators are recruited through a stringent evaluation  process (see Program Planning and Evaluation Core section). As part of the recruitment process, a start-up  package is negotiated that includes salary support, initial equipment purchases as well as funds for laboratory  operating expenses for up to three years. These funds are necessary to allow the new faculty members to  establish their laboratories and obtain independent funding. Start-up support for new faculty came from CCSG  funds (typically 1/3 of the cost) with the balance coming from the Dean of Science or Engineering and the  Provost. Recent start-up packages have been approximately $1.5M in total support.  The Developmental Funds of this CCSG are also used to fund Pilot Projects in new research directions. The  ability to provide funding for Pilot Projects is a highly effective mechanism for the Director and Program  Leaders to influence the progress of cancer research at MIT and to rapidly respond to new opportunities and  new strategic directions. It also represents a means to bring different Koch Institute Members together in  collaborative projects. Pilot Projects are expected to be novel and early-stage. They are often high risk/high  reward in nature, and it is anticipated that the funding will allow for the generation of preliminary data that might  form the basis of future grant applications.  The final use of these funds is for the development of new Core Facilities, in particular the expertise to operate  state-of-the-art-instrumentation and provide new leading edge services, all based on the ever- changing  scientific demands of Center Members. This need reflects the emergence of new technologies both at the  outset and over the course of the proposed funding period.  CCSG Developmental funds allow flexible response in all three categories and they have played, and will  continue to play, a key role in leveraging Institutional funds."
"9280003","TR&D 1 - Experimental design in solution NMR spectroscopy Summary  A major effort of the Center on Macromolecular Dynamics by NMR Spectroscopy (CoMD/NMR) will capitalize on and extend the dramatic advances in solution NMR methods for characterizing macromolecular conformational dynamics that have occurred over the past 25 years. TR&D1 has three major foci: (i) spin relaxation for fast (ps-ns) internal dynamics and overall rotational diffusion, (ii) chemical exchange for µs-ms internal dynamics and interaction kinetics, and (iii) residual dipolar coupling constants, scalar coupling constants, and chemical shifts that report averaging over conformational distributions on time scales faster than 1/??, where ?? is the variation in the given parameter between conformations. Experimental and analytical methods in all three areas will be developed with a focus on application to the really challenging protein and nucleic acid targets with complex dynamics and large molecular masses represented by the Driving Biomedical Projects. This TR&D will be strongly integrated to the other three TR&D components of CoMD/NMR, through synergistic applications with relaxometry in TR&D2 and solid-state NMR in TR&D3 as well as through tight integration with software development in TR&D4."
"9270929","ABSTRACT: Community Outreach and Engagement Core With its scientific theme of the exposome, HERCULES has been a unifying force for residents, community- based organizations, government agencies and academic partners in Atlanta. We propose to build on the momentum of our first three years to: 1) maintain and expand multi-directional dialogue around environmental health issues within the Atlanta community, 2) enhance community capacity to address local environmental health concerns and to partner in community-engaged research projects, and 3) guide and support HERCULES Scientists in community engagement and outreach. We have formed a large and actively engaged Stakeholder Advisory Board that not only serves as a platform for multi-directional communication about environmental health issues and research, but also makes decisions about how the Community Outreach and Engagement Core (COEC) should advance its agenda. Specifically, we plan to conduct ?Exposome Roadshows? to further disseminate the exposome concept and employ concept mapping to ensure that community perspectives are integrated into exposome frameworks as they evolve. Our Community Grants program will address community-identified environmental health concerns that incorporate an exposome perspective, as well as strengthen community capacity to address environmental health concerns. Additionally, we will develop a Community-Based Participatory Research course for doctoral students in the Environmental Health Sciences Program to prepare future scientists for community-engaged research and we will consult with faculty who receive a CBPR pilot grant from HERCULES and/or who are interested in integrating community-engaged approaches into their environmental health research. The COEC will provide the needed mechanisms to ensure that community voices inform the HERCULES scientists of local environmental health concerns, with a particular emphasis on neighborhoods disproportionately affected by environmental exposures. In turn, exposome concepts and research findings will be discussed with local communities, public health professionals and policy-makers in a format that is both relevant and accessible. Through a robust evaluation, we will engage in continuous quality improvement of COEC approaches, as well as contribute to the science of community engagement in environmental health."
"9277831","- Project Summary/Abstract  Recently, the incidence of esophageal (EAC) and gastro-esophageal junction (GEJAC) adenocarcinoma has increased dramatically, and have a poor 5-year survival rate of less than 15%. When detected early, these patients can have a good clinical outcome following surgery. These observations underscore the importance of early cancer detection. Patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE) are known to be at increased risk.  Our overarching goal is to advance new methods of imaging to visualize the effects of spatial distribution of genetic alterations in BE by using novel imaging methods to evaluate tumor heterogeneity on the progression toward EAC. We propose a multi-institutional, trans-disciplinary, translational Research Center in the Barrett's Esophagus Translational Research Network (BETRNet). Our mission is to build on our expertise in genomic characterization, peptide biochemistry, and clinical translation to achieve our ultimate goal to perform early cancer detection at an early stage where therapeutic intervention can be most effective. We will identify a complementary panel of genes that are overexpressed on the cell surface and will be used to develop and validate new peptide imaging agents. The targets chosen will address 3 important clinical needs: 1) Real-time endoscopic identification of pre-malignant lesions and early stage cancer to guide endoscopic resection; 2) Risk stratification of BE patients for timing of endoscopic surveillance; and 3) Detection of gastro- esophageal junction adenocarcinomas in patients without endoscopic appearance of BE.  We will use state-of-the-art genomic tools to to identify early overexpressed gene targets that arise in progression of BE to EAC by providing comprehensive analyses of gene expression alterations, DNA copy number variation, and genetic mutations. We will select candidate genes that are expressed on the cell surface where they can be endoscopically imaged in vivo. We will rigorously validate the panel of candidate targets with quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays using an independent cohort of human esophagus specimens. We will use these targets to first identify and validate monomer peptides that are highly specific. We will then arrange monomer peptides in a dimer configuration to produce multivalent ligand target interactions to improve binding performance and allow for early targets to be detected at low levels of expression. We will use a flexible fiber multi-spectral endoscope that can pass through the working channel of a standard medical endoscope to detect multiple targets at the same time.  Successful completion of these aims will provide an integrated multi-spectral imaging methodology to longitudinally visualize overexpressed molecular targets that drive progression of Barrett's esophagus to esophageal adenocarcinoma. This innovative approach can serve as the foundation for validated preventive measures to improve patient management."

"9405267","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period in which life decisions start to be taken over by the adolescent. However, decision making ability may be limited. For instance, reward and executive functions may be modulated differently, or by different factors, during adolescence and as a result may be imbalanced, leading to risky or non-optimal decisions. Adolescents are also at risk for psychiatric illness, including schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar (BP) disorder. Individuals with SZ and BP show decreased decision making ability, although deficits appear to be driven by executive dysfunction in SZ and reward dysfunction in BP. Given the demonstrated importance of executive and reward networks to decision making in adolescence as well as SZ and BP, we take the novel approach of deconstructing this complex process and testing the independent contributions of reward and executive networks to decision making behavior. We will longitudinally assess a sample of adolescents with affective and non-affective psychosis and bipolar disorder, as well as healthy controls, using multimodal neuroimaging. To functionally define the two circuits of interest, we will use a working memory task to localize a fronto-parietal executive network and a reward responsivity task to localize a ventrostriatal-orbitofrontal network. Task-based regions of interes (ROIs) will be used as seeds for diffusion tensor imaging tractography and as ROIs in which to probe grey matter (GM) thickness. To assess structural development we will use a combination of within and between subject data to plot the trajectory of structural and behavioral change from age 12-21 in patients and controls, as well as whether structural change (white matter (WM) and GM) in each circuit mediates behavior. Then, we will test whether there is a differential impact of illness on development of the two circuits, such that mood symptom severity (across all diagnoses) is associated with reward circuit alterations while severity of positive symptoms is associated with changes in executive networks. We will further test whether a traditional categorical analysis or our symptom spectrum analysis can account for more of the variance in the structural measures. Finally, we will determine the neural biosignatures that describe individuals at high and low ends of the symptom spectrums by performing a profile analysis based on data from ROIs in both networks. We will also test the degree to which baseline lab-based decision making performance longitudinally predicts real life behavior, as well as if WM and GM maturation between baseline and 1 year follow up can predict behavior at the 2 year follow up. This work may help identify novel treatment opportunities specifically appropriate for developing adolescents, who may be amenable to treatments that would not be as effective in adults. Further, if we can identify specific aspects o decision making that are affected in individuals with different symptom profiles, that may provide important traction on how to uniquely tailor cognitive remediation approaches. Finally, if we can predict later real life behavior with measures from laboratory visits, we can identify individuals n need of social or cognitive intervention."
"9283645","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To provide optimal HIV treatment and prevent new infections among women and adolescent girls in Kenya, it is necessary to conduct locally relevant research that addresses the know-do gap and can be readily translated into national guidelines, clinical practice and policy. The proposed training program's primary goal is to build capacity at the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) in implementation science focused on HIV, women and adolescents while creating bridges to other organizations responsible for healthcare practice and service delivery. KEMRI's strong commitment to conducting research that informs service delivery and improves national health outcomes in Kenya forms the foundation for the program. This foundation is strengthened by the University of Washington's (UW) long-term collaboration with KEMRI and other Kenyan institutions, such as the National AIDS and STD Control Program (NASCOP). The program will be led by Dr. Carey Farquhar, UW Professor of Medicine, Epidemiology and Global Health, and Director of two large HIV training programs in Africa, and by Dr. Elizabeth Bukusi, an obstetrician-gynecologist with extensive research experience who is currently Deputy Director of Research and Training at KEMRI. The first aim of the proposed program will build implementation science research capacity at KEMRI and NASCOP by training 8 medical doctors in master's and doctoral programs offered by the UW School of Public Health. After 9 months of coursework in Seattle, trainees will return to Kenya for 9 months to conduct implementation science research projects focused on HIV treatment and prevention for women with guidance from a team of UW, KEMRI and NASCOP Core Faculty. During this period they will also complete an externship at the Kenya Ministry of Health, CDC-Kenya, or another governmental or non-governmental organization working in HIV care and prevention for women and adolescents. The program's second aim will further strengthen capacity at KEMRI by supporting medium-term training for 5 faculty who have excelled in teaching and research at the graduate school. After 5 months at UW, faculty will return to KEMRI equipped to teach new courses in advanced research methods, implementation science and adolescent and women's health and having completed a grant proposal or manuscript related to women and HIV. The third aim will extend the reach of training to a greater number of KEMRI and NASCOP staff by providing 1-week workshops on implementation science, grant writing, and manuscript preparation; 1-day workshops for county medical directors will also be offered in collaboration with KEMRI staff to promote engagement of local care, treatment and prevention leaders in areas where women are hardest hit by the HIV epidemic. This three-tiered approach uses UW's well-established approaches to training, the proposed program to build greatly needed implementation science research capacity at KEMRI and its partner organization NASCOP and change the face of the HIV epidemic for women and adolescent girls in Kenya."
"9258457","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nearly three-quarters of African American women and half of non-Hispanic White women of childbearing ages in the US are overweight or obese. About one-half (46%) of pregnant women exceed gestational weight gain recommendations. This problem is significant because excessive gestational weight gain is a strong risk factor for new or persistent obesity in women and increases a woman's risk for maternal complications. Furthermore, accumulating observational studies show that higher maternal gestational weight gain is associated with higher offspring birth weight, which persists in childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood. Novel intervention approaches have the potential to help overweight/obese financially disadvantaged women achieve healthy weight control during and after pregnancy and improve the health of their offspring. Our experienced multidisciplinary team will build on our promising R21 feasibility study to address the following specific aims: (1) examine the impact of a lifestyle intervention on gestational weight gain and postpartum weight loss in overweight and obese women, (2) examine the impact of the intervention on physical activity (PA), dietary intake, and quality of life (QOL), (3) examine race differences in total gestational weight gain, PA, dietary intake, and QOL; and (4) examine the impact of the intervention on offspring adiposity. Pregnant women (N=500) women, half African American and half White, will be recruited from seven obstetric clinics in Columbia, South Carolina and randomized to a lifestyle intervention (n=250) or standard care (n=250). The lifestyle intervention, grounded in Social Cognitive Theory, will target regular body weight self-monitoring and increasing PA and healthy dietary practices in pregnancy and postpartum. The lifestyle program will start within 15 weeks gestation and will continue through 6 months postpartum. In pregnancy, the intervention will consist of an individual session followed by 12 group-based sessions augmented with 12 podcasts, telephone follow-up, and social media support. In postpartum, the intervention will consist of an individual session (at 6 weeks) followed by 16 podcasts, telephone calls, and social media support until 6 months postpartum. All women will be assessed early in pregnancy (d15 weeks), at 32 weeks gestation, and at 6- and 12-mos postpartum, and offspring will be assessed at 6- and 12-mos. The study is innovative because it incorporates critical components that are missing in the larger literature. Namely, it is theoretically grounded, fully targets PA in addition to healthy eating, objectively measures PA, spans pregnancy to postpartum, includes racially and socioeconomically disadvantaged women who are overweight or obese, is powered to assess race differences in intervention effectiveness, considers the intergenerational linkage on childhood obesity, and integrates state-of-the-art behavioral strategies and approaches combined with innovative intervention channels (i.e., podcasts and social media support), all tailored to a unique population of women from a southeastern state with poor maternal and child health indicators."
"9479448","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  One of the biggest challenges in neuroscience is to understand how neural circuits in the brain process, encode, store, and retrieve information. Meeting this challenge will require methods to record the activity of intact neural networks in freely behaving animals. Spectacular advances with the development of genetically encoded indicators of neural activity and optogenetic actuators now call for methods to image and manipulate the activity of large populations of identified neurons in freely moving mice over prolonged periods of time. Multi-channel imaging is needed to unequivocally identify individual neurons based on their unique gene expression profiles or projection patterns, and a flexible platform is needed so that the scopes can be easily adapted to address diverse neuroscience questions. Optogenetic capability is needed to draw causal connections between cellular activity patterns and behavior. Finally, currently available technology is limited because it requires the mice to be tethered by wires, limiting their range of behaviors and ability to interact with other animals or their environment. In addition, commercial miniaturized scopes are extremely expensive, and cannot be altered to meet individual end-user needs. Here, we seek to remedy shortfalls in existing technology by developing truly open source next-generation two-channel optogenetics-capable, wireless, miniaturized microscopes for imaging and tracking activity patterns of large neural-cell populations in freely moving mice. We will design, manufacture, optimize and test: a two-channel microscope for imaging two fluorophores (Aim 1), an optogenetics-capable microscope for imaging and optogenetic excitation (Aim 2), a wireless miniaturized microscope (Aim 3), and a microscope with combined two-channel, optogenetics, and wireless capability (Aim 4). All throughout, we will build an online environment for sharing our microscopes with the neuroscience community, lifting barriers for others to build, modify, and implant the microscopes and analyze neural activity data with our software. Our new wearable microscopes will have a transformative impact on neuroscience by permitting for the first time the imaging and manipulation of the activity of hundreds of identified neurons and other cells such as astrocytes in freely behaving animals."
"9282607","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The molecular genetics component of Program 1 will build on the progress of this aspect of the Program over the past five years. For example, super-enhancers particularly those that appear to control many activated oncogenes, offer possible new approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Large non-coding RNAs control gene expression is a focus of research in this Program, and these are likely to control important aspects of tumor genesis. CRISPR technology is a very powerful tool for research on cancer, allowing rapid mutation of many genes in parallel and physically targeting transcription-modulating signals to specific sites on the genome. Small non-coding RNAs such as microRNAs are tightly integrated into networks that control the malignant state, but this has neither been fully illuminated nor set into the regulatory networks of genes important in cancer. These topics and others are developed in the research sections of 1) roles of transcriptional super-enhancers in control of cell identity and cancer, 2) large noncoding RNAs and cancer, 3) probing cancer genomes with CRISPR technology, 4) small non-coding RNAs and cancer, 5) cancer genome and transcriptome analysis, and 6) synthetic biology and cancer.           The immunology component of Program 1 features a deep integration of engineering approaches with immunological science to advance our understanding of the interaction of cancer cells with the immune system and develop new forms of immunotherapy. The immunoengineering perspective is a particular strength of the Program and is an instantiation of the broader phenomenon of convergence between engineering and the life sciences in the Koch Institute. Immunology, in particular, is a field that is amenable to both analytical engineering and design engineering. Decoding communications between cells in the immune system using principles of chemical engineering and synthesis and engineering synthetic vaccines using cues from natural immunity are strengths of the Program. These topics and others are discussed in sections 1) therapeutic cancer vaccine development, 2) synergistic antibody/IL-2 immunotherapy, 3) mouse/human models of follicular B cell lymphoma, 4) whole exome sequencing of CTCs as a window into metastatic cancer.           Program 1 has 16 Members from 5 Academic Departments at the School of Science or School of Engineering at MIT. The Membership has a cancer-related funding base of $ 24,934,945 TDC. From 4/1/2009, the Membership of Program 1 published 508 cancer-related articles. Of those, 107, or 21%, have involved multiple members; 45, or 8.9%, intra-programmatic, and, 62 or 12.2%, inter-programmatic; 4 are both intra- and interprogrammatic."
"9413120","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cells and tissues establish and maintain their unique architectures in large part through the tight regulation of protein and membrane transport. One key aspect of this process is endocytic recycling; the selective return of internalized macromolecules to the cell surface from endosomes. Recycling endosomes also contribute to macroautophagy, the process of cellular self-eating required for cell survival under adverse conditions. Thus understanding the endocytic recycling process and its role in cellular physiology is of fundamental importance to cell biology and has broad relevance to many areas of biomedicine including cancer and type II diabetes. Our general approach has been to exploit powerful features of C. elegans genetics to characterize proteins that are required for the recycling process in vivo. We then extend these findings to mammalian cells and to in vitro analysis of the relevant C. elegans proteins and their mammalian homologs. For many of these studies we focused on a system that we pioneered, the C. elegans intestine, a very simple model that allows facile analysis of endocytic membrane transport pathways within intact polarized epithelia. During the previous granting period we gained new understanding of how the early acting Rab GTPase RAB-5 is down regulated by its GAP TBC-2. We found that three recycling regulators directly interact with TBC-2 and contribute to TBC-2 endosomal recruitment. These include RAB-10, a key GTPase acting after RAB-5 in endocytic recycling; the Rho GTPase CED-10/Rac1 that we also show regulates recycling, and the F-BAR protein AMPH-1/ amphiphysin. This novel pathway represents an inhibitory cascade required to terminate the activity of RAB-5 as cargo transitions from early to recycling endosomes. We also elucidated molecular links of another RAB-10 effector EHBP-1 to membranes and the cytoskeleton, regulating the tubular architecture of endosomes. In new preliminary work we have identified key new links of the RAB-10 GTPase to the exocyst membrane tethering complex and propose to test mechanistic models for how RAB-10 influences exocyst during recycling and autophagy. We further identify another key recycling regulator, F-BAR protein SDPN-1/ Syndapin, and identify new SDPN-1 interaction partners important for recycling function. We propose extensive new in vivo and in vitro analysis to define how Syndapin family protein functions on endosomes. Given the high level of phylogenetic conservation of such pathways from worms to mammals, and our parallel analysis in human cells, we expect that our work will provide extensive insight into key conserved elements relevant across species. This work is important for understanding disease etiology and in identifying therapeutic targets for disease intervention."
"9319995","Project Summary Despite the high rates of depression, anxiety, and dysregulated emotion characterized by agitation, irritation, and mood swings in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), few studies have asked how emotional responses may change with the development of AD. Recent work has shown prolonged emotional responses in AD patients' self-report that persist even after memory for the emotional provocation has decayed, and an impaired ability to regulate facial responses to a loud startling noise when instructed to do so. Whether differences in the reactivity to and regulation of emotion are observed over the course of the development of the disease as memory and cognition start to fail remains unknown. Similarly, whether potential differences in the time course of emotion relate to changes in emotional memory biases or to tau and amyloid deposition in brain regions important for emotion are important but unmapped domains of emotion processing. This proposal will use objective measures of emotional responding - facial electromyography (facEMG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) - to measure the temporal dynamics of negative and positive emotional responses in 100 individuals with preclinical AD. Preclinical AD will have been previously confirmed with tau and amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) obtained in a Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (WRAP) substudy under a separately funded protocol. In this proposal, processes occurring directly in response to emotional stimuli (emotional reactivity) will be differentiated from processes occurring after offset of the stimuli (emotional recovery) in both facEMG and fMRI measures. These data will be combined with the extant longitudinal cognitive and imaging data from the WRAP study and compared to normative data previously collected in our laboratory from the Midlife in the US (MIDUS) study using the identical procedures and methods as this protocol. FacEMG and fMRI measures of emotional reactivity to and recovery from negative and positive stimuli will be examined in relation to (i) tau and amyloid deposition in emotion regulation brain circuitry (e.g. the amygdala, hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex, and other regions of prefrontal cortex), (ii) longitudinal cognitive and executive function changes, (iii) later memory for the emotional stimuli, and (iv) compared with normative emotional reactivity and recovery data from the MIDUS study. In all analyses we will explore age and gender interactions. We predict that individuals with preclinical AD will exhibit impaired emotion regulation, which will be proportional to the pathological protein burden and cognitive and memory changes. Because impaired emotion regulation may exacerbate and prolong stress responses which have been linked to neurodegeneration such as occurs in AD, gaining a better understanding of emotional processes in preclinical AD is critical for development of target interventions that may prove useful for slowing and/or preventing the progression to full clinical onset as well as guide treatment and care decisions."
"9317497","Developmental Research Project Program Summary/Abstract Independent research projects of faculty at the SD BRIN partner primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) and tribal colleges (TCs) in past rounds of funding have received some support through subawards to the partner institutions according to the SD BRIN program goals set by each institution. This support enabled the nine-month faculty at the PUIs and TCs to cultivate faculty research programs at each institution primarily during the summers. The result has been the successful establishment of small research programs at the PUIs and TCs that provide research and training opportunities for undergraduate students. SD BRIN intends to build on these successes to further strengthen the research base and capacity and provide student research opportunities through the implementation of the new Developmental Research Project Program called the SD BRIN Faculty Fellowship Program (FFP). The specific aims of this program are: 1) to support research endeavors and career development of promising faculty across the network that address SD BRIN?s overall scientific emphases on proteomics, genomics, and genetics and that fall under one of the three thematic foci: drug discovery/medicinal and natural products chemistry, physiological and developmental responses to stimuli, and environmental health; and 2) to provide career mentoring for PUI faculty. The thematic foci encompass the research expertise of SD BRIN faculty. The research activities in each focus area have the potential for significant impacts on public health, such as the development of novel antimicrobial compounds and increasing understanding of the development of disease, such as the pathogenesis of Epstein Barr virus. Each year SD BRIN will provide funding through the FFP to more fully support 5 ? 7 promising faculty researchers at the PUI partners. The projects will be innovative, multi-disciplinary and reflect a collaborative approach that effectively incorporates the technical strengths provided by SD BRIN core facilities and the scientific expertise of participating investigators within the network. Awards will be $60,000 to $100,000 per year per faculty researcher. Each investigator demonstrating acceptable progress toward meeting the goals of their research and career development plans may re-apply to the program for up to three consecutive years. Each faculty fellow will be enrolled in a comprehensive mentoring program to support career development. The expected outcomes of the FFP are the establishment of sustainable, independent research programs that are competitive for extramural funding, faculty career advancement, increased research and training opportunities for PUI and TC students that will enhance their success in biomedical research graduate programs and careers, and overall growth of the biomedical and biotechnology research capacity in South Dakota."
"9348783","Abstract/Proposal Summary: This proposal requests funding to create public use datasets for two unique cohort studies conducted by the NICHD-funded Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study (PHACS) network. The PHACS network has conducted two US-based observational cohort studies: (1) the Surveillance Monitoring of ART Toxicities (SMARTT) study, which has enrolled almost 4000 infants and children born to HIV-infected mothers to evaluate the safety of perinatal exposure to antiretroviral (ARV) agents, and (2) the Adolescent Master Protocol (AMP) study, which evaluates the effects of HIV and ARV treatments in children and adolescents who are perinatally HIV-infected (n=451) or perinatally HIV-exposed (n=227). The SMARTT and AMP studies have collected data from face-to- face study visits, medical charts, questionnaires, laboratory assessments, and neurodevelopmental assessments, and now represent an exceptional data resource for addressing scientific questions related to HIV infection or exposure, both among adolescents who have lived with HIV infection since birth, and among a growing population of HIV-exposed and ARV-exposed children born to mothers with HIV infection. Both studies are ongoing with annual follow-up visits. The specific aims of this proposal are to create public use datasets and corresponding documentation for the SMARTT and AMP studies based on data from study entry through 2 years of follow-up. Public use datasets will be submitted to the NICHD-supported Data and Specimen Hub (DASH). Measures will be taken to protect confidentiality and privacy of patient data. The public use datasets for SMARTT and AMP will span a wide spectrum of health outcomes in these unique populations and enhance access to the wider scientific community, providing increased speed of scientific and medical research. Findings from secondary analyses will enhance care of children in HIV-affected families."
"9485565","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This award will operate a Regional Medical Library (RML) for the National Network of Libraries of Medicine (NN/LM) Region 6 (Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington) at the University of Washington. In the rural and frontier counties of Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington, health professionals, emergency first responders, and librarians are challenged by limited staff and resources, sparse populations, and long travel distances to reach those in need - especially seniors, children, and underserved communities. Even an event of modest size, whether it be an influenza outbreak, wildfire, or network power outage, can quickly overwhelm a community. To overcome these barriers, the RML has taken a unique approach to build a stronger member network providing health and data information access in the community. In May 2016, the RML will launch Be Boundless, an innovative regional medical library program which strengthens regional collaboration with network members, state or regional organizations, and provides educational program and funding opportunities to improve access to quality online health information resources to priority groups such as: health professionals, seniors, K-12, public health workforce, libraries, and minority and rural communities. The major aims of this program are: (1) to restructure and strengthen the governance in Region 6 to include regional leaders who will assist the RML in pushing resources and awareness about the program into the community; (2) to teach health professionals and librarians more about their roles in providing equitable access to high quality health information by promoting NLM programs and services; (3) to work with regional partners to bring NLM resources to interprofessional healthcare teams, including physicians, nurses, allied health professions, and community researchers; (4) to continually engage libraries to ensure that communities have access to quality and culturally appropriate health information; (5) to partner with existing organizations to provide training workshops on: accessing and sharing biomedical big data; using clinical data to solve primary care health questions; data visualization; (6) to expand the network membership model to include data organizations; and (7) to support collaboration with state or regional organizations by funding awards that improve access to quality online health information resources with a focus on underserved and priority communities. The result will allow sharing of knowledge, expertise, and resources to maximize investment of National Library of Medicine resources and expertise to the region in order to improve health outcomes in the Pacific Northwest."
"9222818","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and long-term disabilities in children, yet there remains a critical need for accurate markers of outcome in these patients. Identification of improved MRI markers of long-term neurocognitive outcome will improve clinical prognostication after an injury and help to direct and monitor rehabilitation strategies. Recent advances in neuroimaging have elucidated the existence of large-scale brain networks responsible for distinct cognitive and psychological functions. A network-based framework for TBI-induced cognitive dysfunction is a novel paradigm for investigating hypotheses regarding the relationship between patient-specific injury patterns and neurocognitive outcomes. Using this framework, this study will identify early imaging predictors of global and specific neuropsychological functions after severe pediatric TBI. In addition, the study will investigate the association between late MRI markers of brain network dysfunction and impairments in commonly affected cognitive domains (executive function, memory, and internalizing behavior). The project will leverage an ongoing, multi-center study of severe pediatric TBI to enable this large neuroimaging study with the following three aims: Aim 1: Test whether the severity and location of white and gray matter injuries identified on MRI early after injury independently predict functional and neurocognitive outcomes one year after severe pediatric TBI. Acute MRI scans will be assessed using standardized common data element (CDE) definitions, and MRI measures predictive of global and domain- specific cognitive outcomes will be determined. Aim 2: Test whether global or regional cerebral atrophy at one year post-injury is related to neurocognitive and behavioral impairments after TBI. Global and regional volumetrics will be determined from structural MRI scans, and correlated with neuropsychological testing measures of function in each cognitive domain. Aim 3: Test whether TBI-induced alterations in white matter microstructure and functional network connectivity are related to impairments in cognition and psychological functioning. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional MRI (rfMRI) will be used to investigate the relationship between damage to specific brain networks and neurocognitive function. Successful completion of this project will determine clinically useful MRI markers of neurocognitive outcome and will provide new information on the relationship between brain network dysfunction and cognitive impairments after TBI. Identifying early imaging predictors and late imaging markers of specific neuropsychological impairments would be a major advancement, providing new tools for directing rehabilitation strategies towards at-risk cognitive domains, and thereby improving long-term function and quality of life in this vulnerable population."
"9322079","Diabetes mellitus is a highly significant health problem, affecting more than 25 million people in the United States alone. Our understanding of the pathogenesis of diabetes has benefited immensely from the molecular genetic analysis of the disease both in human and in rodent models. Advances in genomics technologies have enabled investigators in the fields of diabetes and endocrinology to simultaneously analyze the expression levels of thousands of genes, and analyze their epigenetic regulation. During the past grant cycle, we have dramatically expanded the capabilities of our well-utilized Functional Genomics Core to serve the DRC's membership needs. We have acquired four next generation sequencing instruments and established multiple applications, including ChIP-Seq for transcription factor occupancy and histone modifications, exome capture and sequencing, RNA-Seq, microRNA-Seq, HITS-CLIP, ATAC-Seq, and methylome analysis. During the next grant cycle, we will offer an expanded repertoire of next generation sequencing services, including library construction and bioinformatics analysis to the DRC's membership. We have recruited Dr. K.-J. Won, an expert computational biologist, to provide advanced bioinformatics analysis exclusively for DRC members. The Core will interact closely with the other DRC cores, for instance in correlating the phenotypic analysis performed on genetically altered or metabolically challenged mice with their expression profiles, including single cell RNAseq, and epigenetic regulation to greatly enhance the power of each individual analysis. Furthermore, similar assessments of the function of control and diabetic human islets from the same donor by the islet biology and functional genomics core will provide valuable functional information that may be integrated with changes in DNA sequence or genome-wide measurements of epigenetic regulation or gene expression. This core, in conjunction with the others, will help measure and understand the normal and pathologic genetic and epigenetic states of islets, adipose tissue, liver, and other important tissues types as it relates to the development and function of these tissues."
"9277833","Abstract ? This research project falls under genomics of tumor heterogeneity and their impact on the  progression toward EAC as one of the possible areas defined in RFA-CA-16-006. We have previously  identified EGFR and ErbB2 using gene expression profiles as promising cell surface targets based on high-  frequency gene amplification for imaging of EAC, and have developed peptides that are specific for these  targets. We now aim to identify early targets that arise in progression of BE to EAC. We expect to find greater  variability and lower levels of expression for early compared with late targets, thus have prepared a more  rigorous approach. We will use Affymetrix arrays and RNAseq analysis to identify early gene targets that are  overexpressed on the cell surface and can be developed for imaging. We will use these sophisticated genomic  tools to provide a comprehensive analysis of gene alterations, mutations, and DNA copy number variations in  human esophagus specimens to identify a panel of promising candidates. We will rigorously validate  candidate targets using quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays prepared from  an independent cohort of specimens. This approach requires a large number of HGD that are uniquely  available in our large tissue biorepository of n = 780 human esophageal specimens, including n = 560 EAC,  collected de novo (no neo-adjuvant chemo or radiation therapy). For each early target validated, we will  transfect telomerase-immortalized BE cells to overexpress the target on the cell surface for use in developing  the monomer and dimer peptides in Project 2.   Successful completion of these aims will result in identification and validation of a panel of early gene  targets that arise in progression of BE to EAC that will be used in Project 2 to develop novel peptide imaging  agents."
"9486022","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a result of medical advances that prolong the lives of many patients with life- threatening conditions (cancer, AIDS, and transplants), which often compromise host defenses and immunity, the incidence of opportunistic fungal infections continues to increase. The development of new antifungal drugs has improved the prognosis for many patients, but they have also led to the emergence of new and more resistant pathogenic fungi. Thus, it is essential to recruit and train young scientists to develop rigorous independent careers focused on mycological research. The same mandate applies to research on fungal plant pathogens, which continue to reduce the global food supply. In contrast, several innocuous fungal species have become powerful surrogates for studies of eukaryotic biology and genetics. These model fungi species have proved indispensable in driving progress in biomedical sciences and biotechnology. Thus, investigators and institutes in multiple areas of research continue to seek scientists who are capable of utilizing model fungi as experimental tools.             This application proposes a continuation of the multidisciplinary, tri-institutional Molecular Mycology and Pathogenesis Training Program (MMPTP), which was awarded 10 years ago. The MMPTP involves three neighboring institutions, Duke University, North Carolina State University and North Carolina University at Chapel Hill. The 26 faculty members constitute perhaps the largest concentration of researchers who study fungi. They share resources, interact regularly, and collaborate frequently. The MMPTP recruits, supports, and trains promising postdoctoral scientists and physicians to develop productive research careers in molecular mycology and pathogenesis. Candidates for training include recent doctoral graduates in biomedical sciences, physicians who have completed residency training, and experienced postdoctoral fungal researchers with outstanding potential who are supported for shorter tenures to enhance their expertise. These trainees will become the future experts and leaders in diverse areas of fungal research in academia, industry, and government. The MMPTP has been highly successful. All 24 trainees who completed the program have productive careers in science. One is a governmental scientist, seven are in industry, and 16 are in academia including multiple alumni who are assistant and associate professors with tenure excelling in mycology."
"9268061","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a highly prevalent but heterogeneous disorder, particularly with respect to disease progression. Thoracic imaging holds promise for characterizing disease heterogeneity but is limited by the inability to resolve emphysema and small airways disease. Small airways disease is the primary site of airflow obstruction in COPD and precedes the development of emphysema. There remains a critical need to non-invasively characterize the pathologic heterogeneity of COPD, particularly at an early stage in order to develop targeted therapies. We recently developed the Parametric Response Map (PRM capable of assessing functional small airways disease (fSAD) and emphysema. Our preliminary data suggest that PRM: a) identifies abnormality even in those without spirometric obstruction; b) fSAD is the predominant lesion in mildly obstructed patients whereas emphysema predominates in more severely obstructed subjects; c) and fSAD precedes the development of CT defined emphysema. We hypothesize that PRM metrics will allow us to non-invasively evaluate the regional structural heterogeneity of airflow obstruction and its relationship to clinically relevant outcomes. To test this hypothesis we plan to leverage two NHLBI cohorts. The first is the Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study (SPIROMICS), a 3,200 subject study where a baseline and one-year CT are already included in the protocol linked to extensive clinical and biologic data; this proposal will also fund an additional 200 three-year CT's. The second is COPDGene, a 10,000 subject study with baseline and five year CTs. We will also take advantage of the active lung transplant programs at the University of Michigan and Temple University to obtain explants for this proposal. We plan to test our central hypothesis by pursuing the following three specific aims: (1) determine whether PRM fSAD precedes the development of emphysema and lung function decline by performing PRM on baseline, 1-year and 3-year CT images; (2) determine the relationship between PRM metrics and clinical outcomes including acute exacerbations of COPD; and (3) determine relationship between the extent of histological abnormality in the small airways and the emphysema with PRM metrics from the same patients. it is our expectation that PRM fSAD will identify COPD patients at risk for more rapid disease progression and histologically verified small airways disease. Such results could both identify patients appropriate for more intense, targeted therapy at an early disease stage and contribute to our understanding of the progression of small airways disease and emphysema in COPD and its relationship to important clinical outcomes."
"9482497","Project summary This is the 3rd, 5-year collaborative agreement between CDC's Malaria Branch and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM). The proposed research strategy follows the objectives outlined in the FOA and involves 4 themes: a) Operational research (OR) related to malaria transmission reduction, b) OR to identify novel or improved interventions for children with severe malarial anaemia and pregnant women, c) Maximising the public health impact by supporting translation of global policies for the control of malaria in pregnancy to country level policies through information exchange (3.1), and d) Strengthening research capacity of the overseas partners in Kenya, Malawi and Indonesia by provision of individual level PhD and post-doctoral studentships and group courses (5.1). Malaria transmission reduction OR activities take place under the umbrella of the long-term collaboration between the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) and CDC in Kenya. LSTM will work with CDC to provide technical support to KEMRI to build the information infrastructure needed to track malaria transmission intensity and progress towards malaria control targets, including the rational development of large-scale entomological monitoring systems in situations with declining vector densities, increased outdoor biting and vector resistance to the commonly used insecticides (1.1), support the development of enhanced semi-automated routine surveillance systems with scannable registers, and conduct continuous malaria indicator surveys for real- time monitoring of the case-burden and infection prevalence (4.1). LSTM will support CDC to develop the concept and seek funding for proof-of-principle studies that determine the safety, feasibility and effectiveness of mass-drug administration with antimalarials when combined with indoor residual spraying (2.1). It will support dose finding studies with primaquine and ivermectin that aim to identify adjunct therapies to enhance the impact of mass drug administration (MDA) (2.2), and support the economic evaluation of different interventions and surveillance methods as part of the transmission reduction activities (2.3). Studies in high risk groups includes research to improve adherence to malaria case-management guidelines in pregnancy in western Kenya (1.2) and three large multi-centre trials including one on the prevention of rebound admissions and deaths with post-discharge malaria chemoprevention in children with severe anaemia in Kenya (2.4) and two on the control of malaria in pregnancy: STOPMiP-Indonesia (2.6), STOPMIP2 in Kenya and Malawi (2.5) evaluating the safety and efficacy of intermittent preventive therapy with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine."

"9281562","Diagnosing and treating cancer requires having a reliable set of affinity reagents that can specifically and strongly bind to cancer-related protein targets. These reagents are the necessary molecular tools that will enable next-generation technologies for studying, diagnosing, and fighting cancer. Current approaches to producing such reagents, however, are unreliable, expensive, and slow. Existing reagent generation methods (e.g., hybridoma technology, phage display, yeast display) are not readily adapted to leverage high throughput library sequencing. Where reagents do exist, they are often both extremely expensive and poorly characterized. It is these important shortfalls that this research project aims to address.  This project combines two powerful existing technologies: 1) mRNA display and 2) Modular Microfluidic and Instrumentation Components (MFIC) to dramatically speed target-directed, renewable reagent development. mRNA display is a molecular selection technology that is uniquely capable of searching libraries of more than a trillion unique compounds to develop ultrahigh affinity reagents against cancer-relevant targets. While this technology has an impressive demonstrated track record of producing such reagents, it has so far been limited to the laboratory scale. This project will adapt it to a true high-throughput format by integrating it into a continous flow microfluidic system based on MFIC technology. By automating mRNA display, this project will make it broadly accessible to the research community while decreasing its cost and increasing its throughput.  Once the automated system is developed, we will use it to produce affinity reagents that target two key cancer screening protein markers?PSA and CA125. These markers are broadly used (they were the primary tools used in 154,000 patient Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO)) and renewable, inexpensive reagents that recognize these biomarkers would clearly be of utility. An automated microfluidic mRNA display system will be used to develop novel, specific, and high affinity reagents for these targets. Developing a microfluidic approach for mRNA display selection will involve implementing a magnetophoretic separation system that can both perform affinity selections and purify the products of preparative biochemical reactions. An automated system for preparing mRNA reagents will be combined with an automated target selection system. The DNA-encoded products of this selection will be amplified in a microfluidic PCR system. The entire process workflow will be implemented in a closed loop to enable multiple rounds of selection and amplication, producing an optimal high affinity binding reagent. Each step of the automated mRNA display will be benchmarked for quality assurance by developing affinity reagents for the cancer marker Bcl-xL; standard manual mRNA display has proved resoundingly successful at producing such reagents and there is plentiful existing data against which to benchmark."
"9488714","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a paradigm shift in testing and modeling of chemical toxicity. Current toxicology calls for cell-based (vs. animal-based), evidence-based, and Omics-based assays. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) play important roles in the maintenance and repair of various tissues, including bone, cartilage, and muscle. MSCs are also found in circulating blood and participate in the wound-healing process. Therefore, MSC is arguably one of the most physiologically relevant adult stem cells for chemical toxicology. In response to RFA-ES-15-006, Newomics Inc. proposes this SBIR Phase II project to complete development of its product, high-throughput Omics-based assays to evaluate the effects of chemical toxicants on proliferation and differentiation of stem cells. The Phase II project is buil upon the extremely promising results generated from our Phase I project. In Phase I, we have demonstrated a robust and universal two-stage workflow for Omics-based and high-throughput screening of chemical toxicity using human MSCs. We have also discovered several pathways and networks for mechanistic understanding of chemical toxicity on MSCs. In Phase II, we will scale up our toxicity assays for MSCs using the Tox21 10k library, develop Omics-chips and validate their applications in Omics-based assays for chemical toxicity, and provide a toolkit for screening the effects of chemical toxicants on cell differentiation. Once developed, our platforms and solutions may be utilized for chemical toxicity studies of other types of stem cells such as ESCs and iPSCs, to help prioritize chemicals for in-depth toxicological evaluation, and to even help develop new intervention strategies for mitigating chemical toxicity, thereby contributing to public health."
"9278311","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed Cornell University Veterinary Investigator Program is to provide veterinary students with an opportunity to engage in hypothesis-based biomedical research during the formative stages of their education. Veterinarians have much to contribute to scientific discovery in medical disciplines given that an education in veterinary medicine is inherently wide-ranging and comparative. Veterinary students are trained to integrate medical literature from a variety of sources encompassing the full array of animal species and to use problem solving approaches to evaluate disease pathogenesis and therapeutic strategies, ranging from molecular mechanisms to whole animal phenotypes. As such, an education in veterinary medicine provides a solid and broad foundation upon which to develop a focused area of scientific expertise. The goal of this proposal is to help veterinary students discover this synergy and to enhance their interest in biomedical research. The Veterinary Investigator Program will center on trainees working full-time in a research laboratory for a 10-week period during the summer after their first or second year of veterinary school. The trainees will conduct experiments with the guidance and direct supervision of a faculty mentor and will actively engage in all other laboratory activities. The trainees also will participate in several enrichment activities, including: 1) team building leadership ropes course 2) weekly lunch seminars on Current and Emerging Research Techniques, Grant Writing, Scientific Ethics and developing a scientific poster. In addition, the trainees will attend the Annual Center for Vertebrate Genomics Symposium and the Merial-NIH Symposium at which they will present their research, and at the conclusion of the program will deliver a final researc presentation to the Cornell program participants and mentors. Structured time outside of the laboratory, however, will not exceed two hours in any given week to ensure that the trainees have adequate time to devote to a meaningful research project. The admissions process at the Cornell Veterinary College provides a bonus to those who express an in research, thereby enriching the classes with budding researchers. The Veterinary Investigator Program will help fulfill this promise, and tap into the deep pool of potential biomedical researchers who are attracted to the Cornell College of Veterinary Medicine. Ultimately, the Veterinary Investigator Program will provide ten interested students per year an opportunity to avail themselves of the wide range of superb faculty and resources at Cornell University, with the expectation that such an experience will motivate them to pursue a career that includes rigorous scientific inquiry."

The specific aims of GHUCCTS are: 1) to improve the infrastructure that supports high quality interdisciplinary clinical and translational research, both via inter-institutional collaborations between all GHUCCTS institutions as well as multicenter clinical trials across the national CTSA consortium, with increasing levels of speed and efficiency, and to develop innovative computational methods to speed and enhance translation; 2) to continue to develop GHUCCTS as a model of inter-institutional collaboration that leverages the strengths and attributes of its diverse participating institutions to evolve GHUCCTS into regional CTSA hub with unique and synergistic strengths; 3) to leverage our location, expertise and the co-leadership of a minority-serving institution to design and implement research that will have a high impact on underserved populations with health disparities, including minorities, people with disabilities, and elderly populations; 4) to design and disseminate vibrant and innovative educational programs at multiple levels (undergraduate, medical school, graduate, study coordinators, research nurses, and junior faculty) that promote team science and provides the highest quality of career development training for the clinical and translational investigators of the future; and 5) to both draw from and contribute to the collective efforts of the national CTSA consortium to advance each of the Strategic Goals of GHUCCTS, the National Center for Advancing Translational Science (NCATS), and the CTSA national consortium. The integration of multiple clinical and translational resources across the diverse GHUCCTS institutions will be accompanied by a strong research education, training, and career development program that will train a new generation of clinical and translational researchers. Our innovative approaches to collaboration and interdisciplinary research involving multiple major research-intensive institutions of our region, in collaboration with the national CTSA network, will ensure that our institutions and our community in the Washington, DC area benefit maximally from the generation and application of new discoveries in clinical and translational science."
"9308850","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer treatments are now designed to uniformly treat the average patient. The safe dose is dictated by the most sensitive 5-15% of the patient population. However, this population-based approach is also accompanied by low expectations of tumor control. Similarly, radiation treatments have been designed to treat the tumor uniformly, although we know from biological and clinical studies that tumors have a heterogeneous response to treatment. We hypothesize that a treatment design that Integrates pretreatment patient factors with an adaptation strategy that uses the first part of treatment to assess tumor and normal tissue sensitivity will permit us to optimize therapy for the individual patient rather than giving a population-averaged treatment that is likely to be less effective. Thi proposal comprises 4 scientific Projects and 4 shared resource Cores within an integrated plan of action: Project 1 and 2 will focus on tumors within the liver and lung. These two sites were chosen for clinical demonstration as their current control rates are low and, as the volume of the harboring normal tissue organ irradiated is the critical factor in toxicity, they offer a great opportunity for adaptation. We will use physiological imaging and other methods to individualize dose redistribution in normal tissues to lower toxicity while also heterogeneously irradiating resistant tumor sub-volumes to improve outcome. Project 3 will establish the spatial and temporal precision of imaging-based methods for both tumor targeting and normal tissue response. Project 4 will develop, investigate, and improve decision support tools to take advantage of predictive models for adaptive therapy patient management. Core A provides administrative and statistical support, Core B will support the clinical therapy planning and delivery, Core C will provide analysis of all Imaging data and Core D will handle software design. We feel that we are developing a new paradigm for radiation therapy and recognize only a few other programs in the world with our ability to develop a system that combines biological assays of toxicity, imaging, planning, delivery, and clinical leadership to safely adapt therapy based on each individual's characteristics and response to therapy."
"9280137","Project Summary/Abstract This application requests a five-year renewal of the predoctoral training program in demographic and population studies focused on child health and human development at the California Center for Population Research (CCPR) at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). CCPR is the primary center for research and training in demography and population at UCLA. CCPR faculty are concentrated in Sociology, Economics, and Community Health Sciences, the three primary disciplines in which population scientists are trained in the U.S., as well as in related fields, e.g., geography, public policy. Recent hiring of population scientists has increased the number of CCPR affiliates and attracted increased numbers of students interested in demographic and population studies. Accordingly, funding is requested for 6 predoctoral traineeships per year, an increase of 2 over our training grant award in 2001 and the renewal in 2006 and 2011.  The training program that we seek to renew and expand plays a central role in CCPR-coordinated training at UCLA. It builds on strong graduate programs in sociology, economics, and public health; a distinguished multi-disciplinary faculty with a diverse portfolio of research than spans economic, social, and health demography and reflects the NICHD/PDB mission; and abundant resources for population research at UCLA. We seek to train the next generation of population scientists to carry out theoretically informed, methodologically sophisticated research on topics of contemporary relevance that relate to population studies. We have built an innovative curriculum in each of the three core departments, Sociology, Economics, and Community Health Sciences (CHS), and integrated interdisciplinary training in population science into their programs.  For the renewal, we retain the existing features of the successful program, including a training seminar with presentations by invited speakers, trainee proseminar, mentorship, and cross-disciplinary coursework. Since the previous renewal, we added the trainee proseminar at which current and past trainees meet with invited faculty guests and discuss the speaker's research and research trajectory. We also added the requirement that all trainees complete at least one course in demography from an approved list of courses. We will also add the requirement that all trainees complete at least one advanced methods course.  The program has a remarkable record of success at producing independent investigators who carry out cutting-edge research in social, economic, and public health topics that reflect the NICHD mission. Of the 29 trainees who have completed their PhD since 2005, 11 are now assistant or associate professors at major universities, 9 hold research intensive positions, 4 are postdoctoral researchers at major universities, and 4 hold appointments as lecturer (with 1 currently on the market). Thus, most trainees secure tenure-track faculty or other research intensive positions, often preceded by prestigious postdoctoral fellowships."
"9284499","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Craniofacial development in tractable models such as the frog Xenopus, has been a popular and highly rewarding model for studies of the cell activities that build complex structures. Much information has been gathered about the chemical and genetic processes that underlie craniofacial patterning. In contrast to and complementing that work, our lab has discovered a layer of biophysical signaling: a regulated distribution of different cell membrane resting potentials that instruct cell behavior and large-scale morphogenesis. We have showed that eye development, limb regeneration, and tumorigenesis are all regulated by ion channel-mediated voltage gradients. We have adapted voltage-sensitive fluorescent dyes to observe these gradients and used molecular tools to modify them thereby regulating individual cell behaviors and reprogramming whole organ primordia. These techniques are distinct from classical methods of electric field application, and reveal not only the molecular-genetic sources of the gradients but also the epigenetic and transcriptional downstream steps through which biophysical properties regulate morphology. Recently, we uncovered a remarkable feature of early craniofacial development: the electric face - dynamic patterns of hyper- and depolarization in the embryonic frog face that precede, predict, and control the shape and location of facial structures. Perturbing these patterns, results in predictable changes in expression of key genes and changes in anatomy. This finding suggests a hypothesis for the heretofore-mysterious observation that several channelopathies (diseases caused by mutations in ion channel genes such as KCNJ2) cause not only neurological deficits and cardiac arrhythmias but also craniofacial defects. The fact that these channels participate in the establishment of the normal bioelectric regionalization of the embryonic face may explain why channels are essential for craniofacial patterning. Our project aims to: 1) characterize in detail the bioelectric properties of the early face relative to gene expression domains (a physiomics atlas merging transcriptional and biophysical data); 2) explore the emergence of the bioelectric face patterns by formulating a predictive mathematical model of self-organization within electrically-coupled cells; 3) reveal molecular details of how voltage gradients regulate specific downstream face-patterning gene expression domains; and 4) develop optogenetic techniques to read/write desired electrical patterns in living tissue to override incorrect membrane voltage patterns thus preventing defects. The resulting data will: serve as an essential foundation for future attempts to merge biophysical and transcriptional regulatory layers in order to explain complex development; establish a quantitative model to prescribe minimally invasive corrective manipulations of voltage-dependent patterning; and to chart a new approach toward exploiting guided self-assembly of bioelectrical patterns to address issues in regenerative medicine, etiology and treatment of birth defects, as well as produce new hybrid constructs via synthetic bioengineering."
"9269520","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A goal of our research is to understand interactions between the immune system and skeletal muscle that are important in regulating muscle repair, growth and regeneration. By better understanding these relationships, therapeutic manipulations of the immune system or its products can be designed to improve muscle growth and regeneration following acute trauma, disuse or chronic disease. Over the last several years, knowledge in this area has advanced substantially, showing that immune cells called M2 macrophages play a major role in muscle growth and regeneration. However, the identity of the specific, M2 macrophage-derived molecules that drive regeneration remains unknown. We propose to test the novel hypothesis that the protein Klotho generated by M2 macrophages is essential for normal growth and regeneration of muscle following injury. In addition, we will develop a novel, cell-based mechanism for targeting Klotho to injured muscle on demand, so that expression of the therapeutic protein is elevated specifically at the location and time of muscle regeneration. We propose to use an acute, muscle-injury model in mice to address the following aims: Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that genetic or pharmacological interventions that modulate Klotho levels affect muscle regeneration. We will manipulate Klotho levels in mice that experience muscle injury by expressing a Klotho transgene, by ablating the Klotho gene, by transplanting bone marrow-derived cells (BMCs) from Klotho transgenic mice and by administering Klotho protein. Mice will be assessed by molecular, physiological and morphological assays to determine the effects of modified Klotho levels on muscle growth and regeneration. Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that Klotho modulates shifts in inflammatory cells from pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages to pro-regenerative M2 macrophages following muscle injury. We will test whether genetic or pharmacological manipulations of Klotho affect macrophage phenotype or function following muscle injury. Aim 3. Test the hypothesis that myeloid cells can be designed to target elevated Klotho expression to injured muscle during regeneration. We will generate a transgenic mouse line in which Klotho expression is driven by a promoter that is most-highly activated in myeloid cells in the context of inflammation and then assay whether transplanting BMCs from those mice promotes growth and regeneration of injured muscle in the recipients. We anticipate that these findings will establish the importance of Klotho in driving growth and regeneration of injured muscle. We also believe that this work can provide a basis for a new, cell-based delivery of therapeutic molecules to sites of injury and repair that may have significance beyond the treatment of muscle injuries."
"9316535","PROJECT SUMMARY Poorly healing wounds linked to age or diabetes have an annual health care cost of over $25 billion. Current therapies consist of application of recombinant growth factors to stimulate angiogenesis and provisional matrix synthesis, but this approach has had limited effectiveness and is very costly. Thus new approaches to correct both inadequate angiogenesis and the prolonged inflammatory phase of poorly healing wounds are needed. My laboratory has been studying the role of Homeobox (Hox) genes in pathological tissue remodeling and have identified a group of Hox3 genes (HoxA3,B3 and D3) whose expression is upregulated during normal tissue repair but not in compromised diabetic wounds. We developed a topical gene transfer methods to deliver plasmids expressing HoxD3 and HoxA3 and observed significant improvement in healing of diabetic wounds. More recently we observed that that paralogous HoxB3 is the most potent and can improve healing to rates indistinguishable from healthy mice. Our preliminary evidence indicates that along with stimulating angiogenesis, HoxB3 also corrects the prolonged inflammatory phase of poorly healing wounds and promotes influx of immune suppressive late wound macrophages and mast cells. Thus restoring of HoxB3 reprograms poorly healing wounds to allow them to transition from a prolonged inflammatory state to an immunosuppressive state that is conducive to wound resolution. We have also observed changes in a number of other immune cells in diabeetic wounds that are corrected by HoxB3 but the role of these cells has not yet been explored. Thus we propose to conduct studies to identify downstream mediators of HoxB3 and establish the functional roles of changes in immune cell trafficking induced by HoxB3 that contribute to greatly improved wound repair."

"9264400","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The retina is one of the most metabolically active tissues in the human body, making it particularly susceptible to hypoxia. In diabetic retinopathy (DR), aberrant oxygen metabolism has been hypothesized to play a pivotal role its pathogenesis. An improved understanding of how imbalances in oxygen delivery and demand lead to the progression of DR is a great but worthwhile challenge, especially considering the rising incidence of diabetes and its position as the leading cause of blindness in the United States. In order to address these questions, the overall objective of the proposed research is to use visible-light optical coherence tomography (vis-OCT) to characterize the oxygen delivery and metabolism in two distinct rodent models of DR. Specifically, we will take advantage of recent developments in OCT to accurately evaluate the inner retinal oxygen delivery (irDO2) and metabolic rate of oxygen (irMRO2) in the db/db mouse and the 50/10 oxygen-induce retinopathy model in rats. The lab has demonstrated that using visible-light illumination, OCT can accurately quantify inner retinal sO2 and blood flow in both mice and rats, which has enabled non-invasive, repeatable measurements of the irDO2 and metabolism irMRO2 in vivo. In the first aim of this proposal, we will use vis-OCT to characterize the longitudinal course to irDO2 and irMRO2 in the db/db mouse. These results will be coupled with investigations of retinal vascular and morphometric changes, which will be made using OCT angiography techniques and retinal thickness measurements, respectively. In the second aim, we will marry the vis-OCT measurements of irDO2 and irMRO2 with histological quantification of retinal thinning, apoptosis, and neovascularization in the rat 50/10 OIR model, a model for the proliferative stage of DR. This is expected to provide a comprehensive overview of the pathogenesis of angiogenesis in this model, which may improve our understanding of the proliferative stages of DR in humans. The insights gained from the results of these two aims will contribute an improved understanding of the metabolic underpinnings of DR and inform future strategies for improved monitoring of the functional status of the retina in DR in humans."

In  addition, the Koch Institute is also linked to review and planning mechanisms of MIT. Policies and specific  decisions about scientific planning, hiring, membership, and the use of CCSG and other funds are made after  consultation with the broader Membership. In his role as Director, Dr. Jacks receives critical support from  Senior Leadership consisting of Associate Directors, Drs. Lees and Wittrup, and the Assistant Director for  Administration, Ms. Quense. Dr. Jacks meets regularly with the Koch Institute Executive Committee, comprised  of Senior Leadership members and other Program Leaders (Drs. Amon, Bhatia, Hynes, Langer, Sharp,  Wittrup, and Yaffe). These individuals bring a wealth of administrative experience to the leadership structure of  the Koch Institute. In addition, the there is an active Scientific Advisory Board, which plays a critical advising  role the Director and Center Leadership.  MIT evaluation of the research, shared resources, administration and operating structure of the Koch Institute  occurs via several processes. Formal internal MIT evaluation processes include an annual report by the Koch  Institute Director to the President of MIT and an annual report and budget meeting with the Vice President for  Research. The Koch Institute is also subject to review by the Visiting Committee of the Department of Biology,  which is appointed by the MIT Corporation and is made up of prominent scientists from outside of MIT and  individuals from industry. The most recent Visiting Committee meeting was held in spring 2013. These  evaluations are used in determining financial support and space allocations by MIT to the KI; both have  increased over the last grant period, reflecting the strong reputation and status of the Koch Institute within MIT.  The Koch Institute has several additional means of planning and evaluation. Principal among these are the  Koch Institute Annual Retreat and bi-weekly Koch Institute CCSG Program and Faculty Meetings. The annual  off-site retreats have proven to be an excellent opportunity for Koch Institute members and their laboratories to  engage with each other and discuss their science, formally and informally. They are also very useful for the  Koch Institute leadership to evaluate the Programs and membership as a whole; in recent years, the retreats  have also been used as a mechanism to evaluate the candidacy of potential Koch Institute members. In  addition, the Koch Institute members meet approximately every two weeks during the academic year to  discuss scientific developments, Koch Institute business, and future directions. Strong mechanisms for ongoing  review of Koch Institute Core Facilities are in place to ensure scientific needs of the Center members are met."
"9265830","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How insulin binds to and triggers the insulin receptor (IR) represents a fundamental problem at the intersection of basic science and clinical medicine. This application, building on a long-term program of research by a team of investigators, promises to provide a new foundation for analysis of structure-function relationships. Prior progress in the field was limited by the absence of a crystal structure of the hormone-IR complex. In accordance with the Aims of the last renewal, collaborative crystal structures have been obtained of (i) the primary hormone-binding surface of the receptor ectodomain (Site 1; Smith, B.J. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 107, 6771-6 (2010)) and (ii) insulin bound to Site 1 (the micro-receptor complex; Menting, J.G. et al. Nature, 493, 241-5 (2013)). The physiological significance of these structures have been validated in the context of the holo-receptor (a) through site-specific photo-cross-linking studies (Xu, B., et al. J. Biol. Chem. 284, 14597-08 (2009)) Paper of the Week and (b) by mutagenesis with application to monogenic syndromes of diabetes mellitus associated with mutations in insulin or its receptor (Whittaker, J., et al. Prc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 109, 11166 (2012)). We request continued NIH support to address the following Specific Aims. Aim 1. Functional Mapping of the Functional Surfaces of Insulin. We will employ mutagenesis and residue-specific photo-cross-linking to map the cognate Site-1 and Site-2 binding surfaces of insulin and the IR. Aim 2 Structure of a Model Hormone-Receptor Complex. We seek to improve the resolution and completeness of the micro-receptor structure through synthesis of heavy-atom derivatives of insulin and design of ultra-stable insulin analogs. Inferred structure-function relationships will be tested by non-standard protein design. Aim 3. Biophysical Probes of the Micro-Receptor and Successive Complexes. Two biophysical probes of structure and dynamics will be employed: (a) TROSY-based heteronuclear NMR studies of the micro-receptor complex at 900 MHz and (b) synchrotron-based hydroxyl-radical footprinting (with MS-MS detection) of the micro-receptor and larger receptor fragments, culminating in comparative studies of the holoreceptor. Aim 4. Toward the Structure of a Hormone-Ectodomain Complex. As a long-term goal, we seek to extend our collaboration with M. Lawrence (Melbourne, AU) to a crystal structure of a hormone-ectodomain complex. Together, these Aims represent the culmination of a 25-year program of research that has sought to combine basic science and its potential translation. Insulin and the insulin receptor represent an ancestral signaling system in metazoans of central importance to human health. My colleagues and I are grateful to the Study Section and NIDDK for making this continuing adventure possible."
"9352413","Aminoglycoside antibiotics remain first line therapy for gram negative infections and are used in conjunction with other antibiotics for certain gram positive organisms. Aminoglycosides, especially gentamicin, have also been used to suppress premature stop codon termination of protein synthesis leading to monogenic diseases like cystic fibrosis and Duchene's Muscular Dystrophy. Unfortunately, they still have an unacceptably high rate of dose and duration-dependent nephrotoxicity, especially in the elderly and in patients with chronic kidney, heart and liver disease. We have previously identified non-nephrotoxic, yet bactericidal, congeners of gentamicin that we now propose to use to determine their efficacy in suppressing premature termination codons (PTC). To do this we will use a human proximal tubule cell line with a novel FRET probe allowing for ratiometric quantitation of readthrough of different embedded stop codons. This will be followed by in vivo studies, again using the FRET probe, but now with 2-photon microscopy in kidney proximal tubule cells labeled by subcapsular delivery of specifically designed plasmids based on the cell culture data. To test the clinical potential of this approach we will study the mdx mouse and quantify dystropin synthesis in response to dose and duration dependent therapy. Finally, we will develop a transgenic mouse for the most appropriate stop codon, determined by the rat studies, and quantify readthrough in multiple tissues throughout the body. This is particularly important as many solid tumor cancers have monogenic premature termination codons that lead to malignant transformation of the cell type and these are also responsive to suppression therapy by aminoglycosides. We hypothesize that gentamicin congeners, with markedly reduced nephrotoxicity, will provide enhanced suppression of PTC leading to synthesis of functional proteins needed to reduce and/or prevent multiple PTC diseases. The nontoxic congeners will allow us to directly compare and contrast differences between toxic and nontoxic forms thereby leading to greater understanding of the factors mediating premature termination codon suppression in multiple cell types. These studies will provide the information necessary to enhance translation into clinical studies of multiple diseases."
"9322078","The Radioimmunoassay and Biomarkers Core proposes to continue offering an increasing number of high quality immunoassay services to our evolving group of Diabetes Research Center (DRC) basic, translational, and clinical scientists. Services over the last cycle have included radioimmunoassay (RIA), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and multiplex ELISA on the Luminex platform for an expanding variety of diabetes and metabolism related hormones and cytokines derived from blood, urine, and tissue samples. These assay services have proven essential for current research in the DRC and Penn's Institute for Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism (IDOM) and will remain an integral part of the future operation and development of the Center and Institute. In the next cycle the RIA/Biomarkers Core will expand its existing services to include the development of assays on a more sensitive multiplex platform based on digital ELISA (Simoa). Simoa technology will be used to develop a novel glucagon ELISA necessary for low sample volume islet studies in rodents and in perifusion experiments, and to implement accurate multiplexing of cytokines at 1000-fold increased sensitivity required for understanding the intersection of inflammation and metabolism in rodent and human studies, and so enhance the value of assay services for DRC investigators. In addition, the Core will proactively engage in outreach to the local research community of diabetes, obesity and metabolism investigators, while enhancing the QA/QC/QM of the assay services provided. In addition, the RIA/Biomarkers Core will integrate delivery of new and existing assay services to an expanding base of investigators in a new state of the art-laboratory housed within IDOM. The new laboratory location will place the Core on the same floor and in near proximity to the Islet Cell Biology, Functional Genomics, and Mouse Phenotyping, Physiology & Metabolism Cores that will enhance the already close interactions among these DRC Cores. The integrated delivery of assay services provided by the Core will be enhanced by further development of informatics infrastructure for ordering, tracking, billing and delivery of service. The performance of a large number of RIAs and ELISAs in a central core facility rather than in scattered locations throughout the University provides a significant overall savings in equipment, personnel effort, and supplies for our investigators, while importantly allowing for the generation of results with better quality due to our enhanced quality control/quality assurance/quality management (QA/QC/QM) processes. We will continue collaborations with other NIH- sponsored core resources and the School of Medicine at Penn in order to enhance and expand the number of services available to our investigators, increase efficiency and technical expertise in the provision of assay services, and continue to improve our throughput and data quality."
"9277834","Abstract ? This research project falls under effects of spatial distribution of genetic alterations in BE on the  evolution of EAC as one of the areas defined in RFA-CA-16-006. We have previously identified EGFR and  ErbB2 based on high-frequency gene amplification using gene expression profiles as cell surface targets for  imaging of EAC and have developed monomer peptides specific for these targets. We now aim to develop  new peptides specific for early targets that arise in progression from BE to EAC to be identified in Project 1.  Recently, we have identified a monomer peptide that is specific for the early target FGFR2. Because genetic  events that drive progression of BE to EAC can be occur in multiple signaling pathways, we will develop a  panel of overexpressed targets to detect the largest percentage of patients with HGD and early EAC. Because  early targets are expected to be expressed at low levels, we will arrange validated monomers in a dimer  configuration to produce multivalent ligand-target interactions for improving binding performance. This effect is  used by antibodies to achieve very high binding affinity and specificity. Higher sensitivity can occur from  simultaneous detection of two unique targets. Greater specificity may arise from dimer binding to larger  regions of target epitope compared with that of monomer. We will use fluorophores as labels that emit with  non-overlapping spectra for imaging with a flexible fiber multi-spectral endoscope. The instrument is small  enough to pass through the working channel of a standard medical endoscope, and can image the mucosal  surface of the distal esophagus in real time to guide tissue biopsy. We will perform ?first-in-human? clinical  studies to establish safety and provide early evidence of efficacy for this novel, integrated imaging approach.   Successful completion of the aims will result in a panel of monomer peptides specific for early targets that  arise in progression of BE to EAC that are arranged as dimers and clinical demonstrated for safety and early  evidence of efficacy."
"9265502","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American youth are growing up in more contextually varied and distinct circumstances. Extensive research indicates that these circumstances profoundly impact the health and well-being of individuals both positively and negatively across the life course. However, little is known about how economic, cultural and ethnic contexts become biologically embedded and how this interaction with biology during development influences trajectories of developmental and health outcomes. Part of the reason for the sparse knowledge is that few investigators have expertise in the three domains necessary to successfully grapple with these questions, namely, developmental science of context, human neurobiology, and advanced research methods. We propose a training program that will help fill this gap in understanding. The objective is to train an outstanding cohort of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows on three pillars of knowledge: (1) developmental science of context; (2) human neurobiology, including brain imaging, genetics, epigenetics, and endocrine function; and (3) advanced research methods (e.g., quantitative statistics appropriate for combining and analyzing longitudinal data from different levels of functioning). This cross-training, which is predicated on an understanding of basic developmental processes, will produce researchers well-positioned to develop cutting- edge work that advances knowledge about how neurobiological factors interact with environmental contexts to influence development across several domains and contexts. It will help meet the demand for developmental scientists who integrate neuroscience perspectives and methods into their programs of research and possess the requisite skills for successful, collaborative, interdisciplinary work at the interface of neurobiology, context, and behavioral development. The demand for this expertise is strong and predicted to grow for years to come, as appreciation increases for the role of neurobiology in normative cognitive and social development and in developmental, learning, and behavior disorders. We request funds to support four advanced predoctoral and two postdoctoral trainees each year. Trainees will engage in a two-year series of courses and mentor-based research training that will allow them to integrate work on context and human neurobiology. The training program will be housed in the Developmental Area within the Department of Psychology. In addition to the 22 members of the Developmental faculty, the training grant includes six additional faculty members from other units including Human Genetics, Biopsychology and Cognition and Cognitive Neuroscience. The training will draw on the rich resources of the University of Michigan, including extensive training in integrative research, courses in advanced methodology and statistics and opportunities for engaging in international research. The training program will prepare predoctoral and postdoctoral students to bridge research in the developmental science of context and human neurobiology in order to decipher how the social environment interacts with genetics and the brain to guide development."
"9105399","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common congenital defect affecting approximately 1% of live births. Initially developed and optimized for adults, cardiovascular MRI (CMR) is increasingly used in pediatric CHD patients to complement echocardiography and invasive angiography for anatomical and functional evaluation of the heart and blood vessels. For children, the non-invasiveness, unrestricted field of view, lack of contrast nephrotoxicity and absence of ionizing radiation make MRI an attractive imaging modality, as many of the patients will likely need sequential imaging and follow-up in the long term. However, current CMR is limited by the breath-holding period, the need to capture the first-pass of a gadolinium (Gd) bolus and relatively thick 2D slices in cardiac cine MRI. Consequently, despite yielding exquisitely detailed information on extra-cardiac vascular anatomy, current CMR methods fall short of providing comparable definition of dynamic intra-cardiac anatomy, such as the cardiac chambers, valves, coronary arteries, and other pulsatile blood vessels, despite the fact that the status of these structures often determines the basis for treatment planning. We propose a new paradigm of CMR in pediatric CHD to address these issues. Completion of the project will result in the clinical deployment of a set of MRI pulse sequences, image acquisition and reconstruction strategies CMR in pediatric CHD patients, and successful validation in a cohort of patients of its diagnostic value."
"9256640","Project Summary/Abstract The Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) occurs during sleep. Most SIDS cases have major defects in the brainstem serotonin (5-hyrdoxytryptamine, 5-HT) system, including reduced 5-HT and tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2), the rate limiting enzyme in central 5-HT synthesis. In addition, rare recordings captured from SIDS cases indicate that death is preceded by bradycardia and hypotension, suggesting failure of autonomic mechanisms governing heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP). However, how reduced 5-HT could compromise heart rate and blood pressure regulation during sleep is unresolved. My proposed research directly addresses this knowledge gap. We hypothesize that during the neonatal period, 5-HT is important in the maintenance of BP and HR predominantly during quiet sleep (QS), when 5-HT neurons are active, and not during active sleep (AS), when these neurons are silent. Our over-arching hypothesis is that the bradycardia and hypotension displayed by 5-HT-deficient neonatal rodents occurs primarily in QS, due to enhanced cholinergic drive to the heart and associated defects in the cardiac baroreflex. To test this hypothesis, we will measure HR, BP and sleep state in freely-behaving 2 week-old rats deficient in TPH2 (TPH2-/-) and wild-type controls. A femoral arterial catheter will be used to monitor HR and BP across AS and QS, determined using nuchal electromyogram and behavioral observation. Drugs will be administered intravenously to determine autonomic tone to the heart under resting conditions, and the strength of the cardiac baroreflex in AS and QS. Immunohistochemistry against Fos will be used to assess the extent to which the activity of barosensitive autonomic nuclei is influenced by 5- HT deficiency. These findings will therefore give new insight into how a specific loss of serotonergic signaling could increase the risk of sudden death in a sleeping infant, and provide the knowledge needed for new translational studies in infants."
"9433338","Project Summary HIV/AIDS is the world's leading infectious killer. Despite substantial research, the worldwide burden of HIV remains high. In 2013, over 2 million persons were newly infected and more than 35 million people were living with HIV. New global HIV prevention efforts that are readily available and affordable are needed. A growing literature suggests that human papillomavirus (HPV) infection may increase risk of HIV. The seven longitudinal studies conducted among women and men consistently demonstrate increased risk of HIV with prior anogenital HPV infection. However, unlike other STIs, HPV can be effectively prevented with vaccination. Few low-middle income countries (LMIC), where the HIV burden is highest, are vaccinating girls, and none include males in national programs. Only three countries currently recommend gender neutral HPV vaccination. We need more studies evaluating the association between HPV and HIV and whether HPV infection at multiple anatomic sites (genitals, anal canal, and oral cavity) and associated anogenital lesions increase HIV risk. In order to fill this knowledge gap, we propose to assess whether HPV infection is associated with HIV seroconversion among men in The HPV infection in Men (HIM) Study, a multinational, prospective male HPV natural history study. We aim to (1) Complete HPV genotyping of genital, anal, oral specimens among 1473 men who contributed study visits beyond year 4 of follow-up (up to 7 years of follow-up); (2) Evaluate the association between HPV infection at three anatomic sites and risk of HIV; and (3) Examine whether the association between HPV infection and HIV seroconversion is modified by infection with other STIs. The proposed research is innovative; as it is the first to assess HIV risk following HPV infection at three anatomic sites. The research aims are feasible given the existing HPV and HIV data. Results from this study may help inform future HIV prevention research and policies."
"9477242","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It clearly emerges from Vision Research; A National Plan that vision research embraces every discipline in the biological sciences, cognitive sciences, and clinical research. Vision scientists are aware of the importance of the interdisciplinary approach to research, and of rapid translation of findings in basic research to clinical care. Accordingly, the next generation of vision scientists will need to develop their scientific skills within an environment that stresses cutting edge science, interdisciplinary cooperation, an understanding of the visual system, and exposure to clinical ophthalmology. This training program, while broad in the scope of participating scientific disciplines, is focused on creating at the University of Pittsburgh a training environment that will favor interactions and collaborations among vision scientists, and involve pre-doctoral students and postdoctoral fellows in interdisciplinary approaches to understanding the visual system and ocular diseases. Although this T32 application focuses on training of basic scientists, our trainees will have frequent interactions with clinical ophthalmologists, attend lecturers in our didactic vision cours entitled Biology of Vision, and have close interactions with physician-scientists through course work, seminars, and data clubs. Our T32 training program will draw graduate students from the Immunology, Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Neuroscience, Cell Biology and Molecular Physiology, and Bioengineering graduate training programs. These programs will provide the structure and basic curriculum, whereas the T32 training program will provide specialized training in vision research. The proposed program will also provide a structure for training of postdoctoral fellows in vision research that will coordinate with the significant support structure already in place at the university. We will strive to attract the brightest students and postdocs with the goals of providing 1) a basic understanding of the anatomy, physiology, and diseases of the eye; 2) appreciation and utilization of the unique anatomical and physiological characteristics of the eye; and 3) awareness of the strengths and limitations of available animal models for ocular diseases."

"9250212","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  Oxytocin promotes affiliative behaviors and enhances the ability of animals to discriminate between individuals of their own species. The amygdala plays a central role in establishing the social and emotional significance of social stimuli including faces and facial expressions. The central hypothesis of this project is that the oxytocin-induced changes at the behavioral level result from cellular changes in the amygdala, which  contains a large concentration of oxytocin receptors. We propose that oxytocin facilitates prosocial behavior by (1) increasing attention directed to social stimuli, particularly the eyes of conspecifics and enhancing the activity of anygdala neurons in response to fixations to the eyes and by (2) enhancing the discrimination of social stimuli through enhanced neural selectivity in the amygdala for face identity and facial expressions.    These hypotheses will be tested by recording the activity of multiple single neurons along with the local field potential in the amygdala of monkeys exposed to videos that simulate socio-emotional interactions with other monkeys. It is expected that oxytocin, administered intranasally or by microinjection into the ventricles, will induce behavioral and neural changes that reflect enhanced attention to the eyes and faces, higher  individuation of faces, and a processing bias for affiliative stimuli. By examining the effects of oxytocin on neural activity in the amygdala, the proposed experiments will provide a comprehensive test of the hypothesis that oxytocin enhances social cognition via a direct effect on single neurons and networks of neurons in the amygdala. Further, the proposed experiments have the exciting potential outcome of enabling a more detailed and mechanistic understanding of higher cognitive processes involved in primate  social behavior, which is critical for the development of better treatments for humans with impairments in social cognition."
"9250210","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  Behavioral evidence across species suggests that oxytocin plays a general role in many aspects of social cognition, yet the neurobiological substrates through which it acts at the neural circuit level are not fully understood. An intriguing but untested idea is that centrally released oxytocin acting on limbic brain regions allows for the neural processing of social cues to gate activity in areas involved in seeking reward, thus facilitating the motivation to socially interact and the reinforcement of conspecific cues. Our long-term goal is to elucidate how oxytocin modulates the oxytocin receptor rich regions underlying social information processing and reward to enhance social cognition. The objective here is to record from chronic electrode implants within these regions during social behavioral paradigms in rodents. Our central hypothesis is that the motivation to interact socially is determined by a balance between positive and negative valence cues, and that oxytocin acts to enhance how positive valence cues and/or suppress how negative valence cues modulate the functional neural connections between cue and reward processing areas, helping to reinforce their encoding. The rationale for our proposal is that, once we know how oxytocin affects functional connectivity between these areas in natural social contexts, our improved knowledge about oxytocin's sites of action will enable direct manipulation of these circuits to enhance prosocial behavior. Two complementary specific aims in two different rodent models will be pursued, each chosen to maximize our ability to deduce the electrophysiological effects of either oxytocin loss of function (Aim 1) or gain of function (Aim 2) during social interactions. Our proposal's significance lies in the fact that it will implicate a specific central limbic circuit in mediating oxytocin's role in facilitating social motivation and socially reinforced learning. The combination of in vivo electrophysiology with oxytocin manipulation in freely moving, socially interacting rodents is an innovation that will enable key questions to be addressed about how real-time neural activity within limbic circuits is dynamically modulated by oxytocin in natural social interactions."
"9359408","Abstract ? Project 3 (The Functional Contribution of Tumor Immunity to PDAC)  PDAC is marked by an extensive desmoplastic reaction/stroma consisting of myofibroblasts, extracellular  matrix (ECM) and immune cells, and oncogenic Kras is a critical driver of PDAC genesis and maintenance.  The functional importance of PDAC microenvironment and its various cellular constituent in oncogenic Kras  dependent and independent PDAC maintenance remains an area of active investigation, but there is minimal  knowledge addressing the role of oncogenic Kras in shaping tumor immunity, in particular the T cell response.  The central mission of our P01 program is to collectively identify a range of novel Kras driven vulnerable nodes  that can be inhibited as a treatment for this devastating disease. The inducible oncogenic Kras genetically  engineered mouse model (GEMM) of PDAC indicated that tumor regression could be achieved via oncogenic  Kras extinction, a process accompanied by depletion of oncogenic Kras dependent cancer cells and significant,  albeit incompletely characterized, alterations in immune response. Studies from Projects 1 and 2 using this  PDAC GEMM also offered mechanistic insights into spontaneous tumor relapse, which includes the presence  oncogenic Kras extinction resistant cells (KRC) with distinct metabolic dependencies (OXPHOS), and the  emergence of tumors with activation of YAP or other yet unidentified mechanism for PDAC maintenance.  Projects 1 and 2 will focus on exploiting the metabolic vulnerabilities of cancer cells and the central hypothesis  of Project 3 is that ?oncogenic Kras and its signaling surrogates have a causal effect on tumor immunity to  facilitate cancer progression?. Knowledge of this oncogenic Kras driven circuitry may illuminate therapeutic  points of intervention in the tumor microenvironment and offer an improved understanding of how to deploy  checkpoint blockade therapies in combination with cancer cell-specific therapies targeting metabolic or salvage  pathways. The study could inform combination treatment that includes checkpoint blockade therapies ? i.e.,  whether OXPHOS inhibition or autophagy inhibition can help or impede such immunotherapy strategies. The  studies proposed by Project 3 are highly interconnected with studies proposed in Projects 1 and 2, and rely  directly on all the Cores of this P01. Specifically, the integrated specific aims of Project 3 are to investigate  Kras* dependent and independent immune response in PDAC (Aim 1), to determine the impact of targeting  metabolic and salvage pathways on tumor immunity (Aim 2) and to identify novel strategies to enhance  efficacy of checkpoint blockade immunotherapy in PDAC (Aim 3). This effort is integral to the overall P01  Program Goal of developing a mechanism-based rational combination strategy that can lead to meaningful  therapeutic advances for PDAC patients."
"9322080","The accelerating incidence of diabetes and metabolic disorders and the continuing high prevalence of endocrine disorders in the American population demands continued exploration of a broad array of corresponding mechanistic pathways, pathophysiologic sequelae, and potential therapeutic approaches. In many cases these investigations can be accomplished most efficiently using model systems established in intact animals. The use of mouse models in these pursuits is now well established for its power, feasibility, and enormous potential. Creation of such models, by directed alterations of the mouse genome, is an essential component of an overall research effort in diabetes, obesity, and metabolic disorders. The Transgenic and Chimeric Mouse Facility (TCMF) provides investigators of the University of Pennsylvania Diabetes and Endocrinology Research Center (DRC) with the ability to carry out these studies in a cost effective and efficient manner. The TCMF applies state-of-the-art equipment and technology by a group of dedicated and highly skilled technical staff to this effort. The major services of the Core include generation of transgenic mice by DNA pronuclear injection, creation of chimeric mice by ES cell blastocyst injections, direct genome mutation/editing/modifications by targeted endonuclease (TALEN and Crispr-CAS) technologies, assisted (in vitro) fertilization, cryopreservation, long-term cryostorage, and shipping of frozen embryos or sperm to/from other facilities. The Core uses multiple microinjection platforms, laser-assisted technologies, state-of-the-art cryopreservation of gametes and embryos, and in vitro fertilization based line re-derivation to facilitate these goals. The facility consists of a microinjection suite, an adjacent dedicated cage room, and an off-site and highly secure cryopreservation storage facility. All functions, from ordering services, to following workflow, to storing and sending out lines are on-line and can be monitored in real-time. These efforts contribute substantially to the overall productivity of the members of the DRC and enhance the strength and relevance of their studies to intact mammalian systems. This maximizes the applicability of these studies to human disease and to the expansion of therapeutic modalities."

"9257431","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Project Summary This proposal supports a project to construct over 100 different Xenopus mutants in key genes related to human disease. The proposed studies will use CRISPR/Cas and TALEN gene editing to create precise models of human disease in the amphibian Xenopus. After a survey of the Xenopus community, there are over 150 different mutants requested to support biomedical research in Xenopus. The current studies are focused on developing Xenopus models of many different diseases for the entire Xenopus community, and each mutant will be developed in close coordination with individual researchers. There are three main aims to this proposal. First, mutations in key genes will be produced in either Xenopus tropicalis or Xenopus laevis using CRISPR/Cas or TALEN gene editing methods. Second, we propose to develop the use of oocyte host transfer for the generation of mutants using CRISPR/Cas and TALEN methods; this will increase the efficiency with which mutations are induced prior to first embryonic cell division and to allow for the creation of uniform heterozygous mutations by limiting Cas9 activity only in the oocyte. Third, we will optimize knock-in strategies with CRISPR/Cas and/or TALEN. All of these aims will help enhance the utilization of CRISPR/Cas and TALEN gene editing methods in the Xenopus model system."
"9397426","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The metabolic function of cells in the inner retina relies on the availability of nutrients and oxygen that are supplied by the retinal circulation. Iner retinal hypoxia is implicated in common and blinding human eye diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy and retinal vascular occlusions. However, the role of oxygen in the development of vascular pathologies is still not completely understood. For a complete assessment of inner retinal tissue vitality, knowledge of vascular and tissue oxygen content, blood flow, and metabolic rate of oxygen is required. Additionally, mapping of retinal oxygenation is necessary for identification of localized pathological abnormalities in a comprehensive manner. Studies performed thus far have not measured these parameters together or over extended retinal areas. Therefore, there is limited knowledge of the interplay among vascular malperfusion, tissue hypoxia, and energy metabolism impairment due to retinal ischemic conditions. The objective of the research proposal is to provide a comprehensive study of oxygen dynamics in the inner retina under normal and challenged physiological conditions, and experimental ischemic states. The study will be possible with the use of our novel retinal vascular and tissue oxygen tension (PO2) mapping technique coupled with blood flow measurements. The specific aims are to: 1) determine abnormalities in retinal vascular PO2, gradients of microvascular PO2, and inner retina oxygen extraction fraction in experimental diabetes, 2) develop a novel imaging system for simultaneous measurements of retinal vascular PO2 and blood flow, and derive measurements of inner retinal metabolic rate of oxygen (MO2), 3) determine normal responses of retinal blood flow, inner retinal MO2 and tissue PO2 to visual stimulation by light flicker, and 4) map the spatial distribution and degrees of retinal hypoxia in experimental diabetes and retinal arterial occlusion. The findings will impact the field by broadening knowledge of coupling between retinal blood flow and oxidative metabolism under a normal physiological condition and elucidate retinal oxygen dynamics in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy and retinal vascular occlusions."

"9316676","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a study using both existing data and a new longitudinal survey of approximately 4,000 individuals to study the relationships among migration, urbanization, and health. Our project is designed to help resolve confusion in the migration-urbanization-health nexus, with direct policy implications for South Africa and both substantive and methodological lessons for a broad array of scientific concerns in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs). A better understanding of the way in which these redistributive forces operate on health (and its complex interplay with economic development) can help inform global health policy by (1) improving our understanding of how migration and urbanization impact population health, so as to better understand the trade-off between the salutary increases in socioeconomic circumstances associated with urbanization (the increasing share of a population residing in towns and cities, as distinct from the urban growth rate) and the health risks that accompany that shift; (2) improving our understanding of population redistribution, so as to be better equipped to incorporate spatial demography into companion health investigations; (3) identifying circumstances where population mobility itself may compromise the treatment cascade - compromising the continuity necessary to deliver suitable health care for chronic conditions; and (4) building scientific capacity in the region. We plan to conduct a new five-year observational study aimed at shedding light on issues of how mobile individuals acquire and manage chronic diseases and access long-term care, combining insights from a new longitudinal cohort study of 4,000 migrants and stayers and more than twenty years of extant data for a population of now more than 100,000 in demographic surveillance. Our study site is a district in rural northeast South Africa and the locations to whih migrants from that origin move. We carry out this study to better understand, at the individual level, how a contemporary, complex pattern of migration and urbanization helps drive the health transition in low and middle income countries. Our innovative approach gathers new data on an array of socioeconomic variables and life history items, health conditions, behaviors, and selected biomarkers. We study several intertwined demographic and health dynamics. We examine the determinants of risk factors for key health outcomes. We measure health care access and treatment, and test whether barriers to care are posed by migration. We also investigate migration dynamics directly so as to better to understand the determinants of population redistribution and the paths of migrant adjustment in destinations."
"9274056","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This work is directed at the development of a microelectrode array for electrocorticography (ECoG) that allows the recording and stimulation of neural activity on the surface of the brain over a large area at high spatial resolution. Existig technologies either allow the recording of neural activity (i) over a large brain area at low spatil resolution (standard commercial ECoGs), or (ii) over a small brain area at high spatial resolution (so called µECoGs). BMSEED aims to produce large-area-high-resolution µECoG electrode arrays (lahrµECoGs). Conventional ECoG electrode arrays are placed on the surface of the brain, and are used as a less invasive alternative to penetrating microelectrodes, which are inserted into the brain tissue. They are used (i) in neuroscience research to explore the fundamentals of how the brain operates, (ii) in brain-machine-interfaces (BMIs) to record neural activity to drive a neuroprosthesis for amputees or to move a computer cursor for the paralyzed, and (iii) for monitoring neural activity during epilepsy surgery to identify the regions of the corex that generate seizures, which subsequently are removed. These applications would benefit from BMSEED's lahrµECoG because it would provide more accurate localization of the recorded signals (i.e., normal neural activity as well as seizures) over a large area, thus improving brain research, making BMIs more robust, and improving clinical outcomes in epilepsy surgery by providing the neurosurgeon with more accurate localization of seizure activity. In all ECOGs, each recording electrode requires one wire to electrically connect to the data acquisition system without intersecting (i.e., without shorting) with other wires. This becomes increasingly difficult  as the density and total number of electrodes increases. BMSEED's lahrµECoG solves this problem by routing the lead wires on multiple levels. In addition, our proprietary technology to produce mechanically robust microelectrodes using microfabrication techniques allows us to reduce the thickness, thus the stiffness, of the device, making the implant more compliant. Importantly, BMSEED's lahrµECoG consists entirely of materials that are suitable for implantation in humans, thus simplifying the FDA approval process. The first specific aim is to optimize the profile of the slope between different levels to provide a reliable electrical connection, and to fabricate and electromechanically characterize prototypes of the lahrµECoG. The second aim is to demonstrate the biocompatibility and capabilities of the prototypes. To that end, a lahrµECoG will be chronically implanted in five cats, and neural recording and micro-stimulation data will be obtained for at least two months. At the end of phase I, BMSEED will have (i) developed the capability to produce multi-level metallization and prototypes of lahrµECoGs, and (ii) characterized their capabilities in a cat model. In phase II, BMSEED will extend the lahrµECoGs development to multi-level metallization on larger, clinically relevant substrate sizes. Our customers will initially be research laboratories, and, after FDA approval, biomedical companies for BMI applications and hospitals for clinical applications."
"9317499","Proteomics Core Summary The Proteomics Core Facility was established at the USD SSOM at the initiation of SD BRIN in 2001 to provide critical research infrastructure and capacity in South Dakota. The primary purpose of establishing a proteomics core facility (PCF) with SD BRIN support was to create, maintain and operate the facility with the capacity to support all SD researchers (faculty, postdoctoral fellows, graduate and undergraduate students) at the SD BRIN participating institutions as well as throughout the state with the capability to rapidly analyze protein expression patterns in their experimental systems. The specific aims of the Proteomics Core are to 1) maintain the PCF (with professional staff) to be used by investigators throughout SD (and from other IDeA states ? a critical goal of the IDeA program), as well as other researchers as needed; 2) provide collaboration and research expertise as well as infrastructure to the participating institutions in the control of cell growth with special emphasis on proteomics; and 3) improve and develop protocols to assist the future plans of researchers from participating institutions and develop collaborations among SD biomedical researchers. The impact of the Proteomics core has already been seen and is exemplified by the more than 100 faculty and graduate student projects that have received PCF support since its inception. These projects have resulted in 33 research publications and 31 presentations that have advanced knowledge in areas relevant to public health such as disease treatment and prevention through the elucidation of the structures of bioactive compounds. Action steps to accomplish the specific aims of the Proteomics Core include the provision of funding to support the core director, maintain the equipment, and provide reagents necessary to run the instrumentation, and a focused effort on the identification of faculty research needs through a needs assessment. The expected outcomes are increased collaborative research, and enhanced resources and capacity to support biomedical research which in turn will lead to an increase in the number of successful grant proposals, publications and presentations that include a proteomics component. Maintenance of the Proteomics Core will continue to have a positive impact on the program goals of SD BRIN as the biomedical research capacity of South Dakota continues to grow."

"9373359","Project Summary There may not be a more significant biological threat than the malevolent release of B. anthracis spores, the causative agent of anthrax disease, over a major metropolis. With the inhalational form approaching 90% mortality, and a spore that can remain infectious for years, protection against this deadly disease is critical. The U.S. anthrax vaccine (AVA) induces toxin-neutralizing protection in animal models. However, its composition is unknown, its immunogenicity is short-lived, and it does not protect against some strains of B. anthracis. Our preliminary data suggests vaccination with bacillus near-iron transporter (NEAT) proteins, which function to acquire and import host heme during infection, can protect mice against anthrax disease. In this application, we use our molecular understanding of NEAT protein function to make and test a novel vaccine composed of heme transporters. We hypothesize vaccination with bacillus NEAT proteins will lead to opsonophagocytic antibodies that target infecting bacilli, unlike the current licensed vaccine, and thus provide broad protection against anthrax disease. Aim 1: Determine the optimal parameters for an effective vaccine composed of heme transporters. In this aim, critical parameters needed to fully evaluate the effectiveness of this vaccine strategy are determined, including specificity, dose, duration, and the optimal adjuvant needed for maximal efficacy for preventing inhalational anthrax. Aim 2: Determine the mechanism of protection and the effectiveness against capsulated strains. In this aim, the molecular mechanism by which this vaccine is protective is determined, and its effectiveness against the most virulent, capsulated strains is assessed. Since NEAT proteins are conserved in every major genus of Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria, this work also has universal appeal for vaccine development against related species."
"9266475","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major adverse cardiac events, such as myocardial infarction (MI), after non-cardiac surgery kill more Americans each year than all motor vehicle deaths combined. Perioperative ß-blocker therapy is the only evidence-based intervention that has been shown to reduce perioperative cardiac risk. Unfortunately, when practiced as usual (i.e., as preoperative ß-blocker therapy, starting an oral ß-blocker before surgery and continuing throughout the perioperative period), perioperative ß-blockade is associated with harm. It exposes all patients to strong ß-blockade regardless of the hemodynamic status. When patients on ß-blockers develop hypovolemia, they are unable to maintain cardiac output, and are at risk for prolonged hypotension, shock, stroke and death. This proposal will test a novel strategy that will retain the effective protection of ß-blockers against perioperative myocardial ischemia, yet not increase overall risk. Specifically, the objective of this application is to determine if postoperative ß-blocker therapy (rather than preoperative) is a safe and effective regimen to reduce perioperative cardiac risk. Specific aim 1 will test the hypothesis that a titrated postoperative metoprolol regimen (IV followed by oral) will significantly reduce myocardial injury and ischemia in high-risk patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery, without increasing the risk of hypotension. Using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) as marker for myocardial injury and continuous 12-lead Holter ECG for myocardial ischemia, the hypothesis will be tested in a well-powered single-center randomized controlled trial (n=600). Primary efficacy endpoints are myocardial ischemia and injury. Primary safety endpoint is clinically relevant hypotension. Recently, hs-cTn has been shown to strongly predict perioperative major adverse cardiac events and death after non-cardiac surgery. Specific aim 2 will extend this concept and test the hypothesis that preoperative hs-cTn concentration can identify patients who may benefit from postoperative ß-blocker therapy. This hypothesis will be tested within the same trial cohort. This research is both significant and innovative as it studies an important public health problem and offers a novel potential option to the vexing problem of perioperative ß-blocker therapy."

It is clear that future academic nephrologists must receive rigorous basic research training in order for significant progress to be made in our understanding of the molecular and cellular processes involved in development of renal diseases and for therapeutic interventions to be developed. Areas of research need include cellular and molecular biology, immunology, genetics and genomics, systems biology, developmental biology and regenerative medicine, stem cell biology and basic virology. It is our belief that the most appropriate type of research environment, the requisite depth of training experience, and protection for a prolonged period of support for individuals training in academic can best be accomplished through a training grant. Our rationale for submitting this application for the continuation of our training grant is our belef that Mount Sinai School of Medicine offers diverse scientific opportunities in an outstanding research environment and faculty mentors who are dedicated to training academic research scientists for a career in academic nephrology, our outstanding track record, and our continued commitment to the education of future investigative nephrologists. This training grant is in the 14th year of funding with a successful training track record, approximately 80% of graduates remaining in academics over the past 10 years, the majority of whom continue to conduct funded nephrology research. Continued support is being requested at the current level of 3 postdoctoral positions for a minimum of 2-years funding per trainee. An experienced group of 24 faculty provide trainees the opportunity to train in a variety of research areas \ related to renal disease. Trainees will participate in an interactive environment with state of the art research facilities, and will participate in required courses, journal clubs, lab meetings and research conferences. In addition to the PI and Co-PI, an Admissions Committee, Review Committee and External Advisory Committee are in place as an organizational structure to supplement trainer supervision and to ensure that the Program remains at the cutting edge of nephrology research and that trainees receive sufficient guidance to optimize their transition to independent investigators."
"9266811","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The PETAL RFA is an exciting initiative to create a multi-disciplinary network that can develop and conduct multi-center clinical trials to evaluate promising therapies and approaches for preventing and/or treating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We propose participation in this network. The lead institution for this proposal is Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), and satellite sites are Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and the University of Mississippi. In aggregate, our site possesses a uniquely strong track record of pre- existing collaboration between emergency medicine, anesthesiologists and intensive care physicians, as well as between our individual study sites. This experience and expertise directly addresses the intent of the proposal. Our research team has a sustained, proven track record of successful, high-impact studies in sepsis and ARDS spanning emergency medicine, perioperative medicine and critical care. Our site is already serves as the coordinating center for the Lung Injury Prevention Trial with Aspirin (LIPS-A) which is in many ways the prototype for the type of study envisioned for the PETAL network. Thus, we are ideally positioned to create an extremely high-performing PETAL clinical center, as well as to contribute to network leadership and scientific direction.         We also submit two proposals for clinical studies to be undertaken by the PETAL network. Both of these studies are based upon strong preliminary data from our institutions. The first study will examine the ability of rosuvastatin to prevent development of ARDS in patients at risk for development of the syndrome. While statin drugs have previously been tested as a treatment for ARDS there is substantial evidence to suggest that they may be more effective as a prevention strategy. This study builds on our success as the clinical coordinating center of the LIPS-A study. Our second proposed study will test the ability of using personalized physiology, the patient's own pleural pressure as measured using esophageal balloons, to set the level of positive end-expiratory pressure in patients with established ARDS. This proposal will support a phase 3 trial of this promising modality.         The expertise and experience of the investigators involved in this proposal will allow the BIDMC clinical site to contribute substantially to the scientific success of the PETAL network."
"9269124","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human beings have a fundamental need to belong. We are powerfully motivated to seek out, engage in, and maintain strong interpersonal attachments. Developing and maintaining close relationships, however, is not an easy task for many people with mental illnesses. Disturbances in social motivation are particularly debilitating, costly, and poorly understood in people with psychosis-related psychopathology (PRP). The RDoC affiliation construct provides a foundation for conceptualizing and unpacking the mechanisms of these disturbances in social motivation. Our scientific goal is to carve the RDoC affiliation construct into two separate sub-processes. Specifically, we will examine how the social approach and avoidance motivation systems of the brain relate to social disability across individuals with PRP and are impacted in their unaffected siblings. This project is grounded in a translational social neuroscience model of affiliation that includes two distinct neural sub-systems: (1) the social approach motivation system is sensitive to social safety signals and promotes social engagement and attachment (primarily involving the striatum, ventromedial frontal cortex, and hypothalamus); (2) the social avoidance motivation system is sensitive to social threat signals and promotes avoidance of rejection and discord (primarily involving the insula, anterior cingulate, and amygdala). These systems are modulated by select neuropeptides/transmitters, chiefly oxytocin (OXT), vasopressin (AVP), dopamine, and opioids. Data from our lab and others indicate that problems in affiliation can stem from disturbances in both of these systems across PRP. We predict that social approach and avoidance make independent contributions, though separable neurobehavioral mechanisms, to impaired social functioning in psychosis. In addition, we will evaluate these systems in unaffected siblings to determine whether they reflect vulnerability factors for social disability and psychosis (unconfounded by medication and chronicity). A diverse sample of 80 outpatients with a history of clinically significant psychotic symptoms, 80 of their unaffected siblings, and 40 healthy individuals from the community will complete established measures at four RDoC units of analysis: circuits (two social reward/punishment fMRI tasks), physiology (N170 responses to approving/ threatening faces), behavior (social reward/punishment learning task), and self-report (need for belonging, fear of rejection scales), as well as social functioning assessments. An exploratory aim will examine whether OXT/AVP molecule and receptor gene polymorphisms relate to individual differences across the four units of analysis. Our primary hypotheses test (1) the validity of the social approach and avoidance motivation constructs across multiple units of analyses and their predictive validity for explaining real world social functioning, and (2) whethe unaffected siblings show impairments in social approach/ avoidance that demonstrate significant within-family correlations. A mechanistic understanding of neural processes that lead to problems in social affiliation is essential for developing new recovery-oriented and preventative treatments."
"9265115","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) has been a leader in mammalian genetics research and education since its inception in 1929. JAX pioneered the development of genetic approaches toward understanding fundamental questions in mammalian development and the genetic underpinnings of human disease. JAX also has a long and illustrious track record of training postdoctoral-and more recently predoctoral-scholars to be productive researchers at the nexus of systems genetics, genomics and computational biology. To support JAX's dual mission of discovery and education, we continually strive to provide cutting-edge, unique and highly relevant training opportunities designed to prepare all JAX trainees for successful scientific careers. The NICHD T32-funded Training Program in Developmental Genetics (TPDG), funded since 1977, is integral to the postdoctoral training environment at JAX. This developmental genetics-focused program provides high-quality postdoctoral training to prepare its trainees for careers as independent investigators in universities, research institutions and the biomedical industry. Today, the program brings together 18 highly productive and well-funded faculty mentors at the JAX Mammalian Genetics campus in Bar Harbor, ME, who provide a uniquely interdisciplinary, integrated and comprehensive training environment. Research areas include mammalian embryonic development, congenital birth defects associated with neurological, sensory and metabolic disease, stem cell biology, reproduction, systems genetics and bioinformatics. The TPDG has supported ~70 postdoctoral trainees to date, 20 during the past 10 years. Previous trainees have been highly successful in moving on to careers in academia, government and industry, and in obtaining research funding. In this resubmission of the TPDG we seek to continue to provide two slots for postdoctoral fellows and request support for two predoctoral students. JAX participates in collaborative Ph.D. training programs with the Tufts School of Medicine and the University of Maine that have grown to critical mass. Specific criteria are used to admit both pre- and postdoctoral trainees into the TPDG. Required and elective curricula have been developed to enrich the training experience. Trainees will test hypotheses regarding the genetic underpinnings of development and disease, and will model new diagnostic and therapeutic modalities, using cutting-edge computational and mouse genetics resources uniquely available to them at JAX. Trainees will have access to focused and individualized career development opportunities, such as teaching and grant writing experiences, and will be integrated into seminars, workshops, and research interest groups. They will write external funding applications, present their findings at scientific meetings, and publish in peer-reviewed journals. Trainee evaluation will be rigorous and coupled with support for growth. The TPDG will thus provide exceptional research opportunities in a stimulating scientific training environment and enable trainees to launch successful independent careers in biomedical research."
"9406567","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The George Warren Brown School of Social Work at Washington University seeks an additional five years of support for a predoctoral and postdoctoral research training program focusing on services to, treatment of, and policies affecting populations vulnerable to substance use disorders and co-occurring and comorbid conditions. The Transdisciplinary Training in Addictions Research (TranSTAR) Program will provide a stimulating and collaborative research training environment that transcends disciplinary boundaries. It aims to produce a cadre of well-trained addictions researchers, with state-of-the-art knowledge of addictions services, delivered in non- specialty settings, and particularly targeted to underserved, vulnerable populations. TranSTAR embraces the paradigm that no single factor determines whether a person will become addicted as highlighted in a recent NIDA report (NIDA 2010, p. 8). Hence, TranSTAR emphasizes the importance of understanding protective and modifiable risk factors and co-occurring and co morbid conditions that inform, influence, and interact with drug use, abuse, dependence, and addictive behaviors. Trainees will acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to: (1) conceptualize meaningful research questions with practical implications for service delivery, policy, and applied research; (2) execute research projects using rigorous and cutting-edge methods; (3) create competitive grant applications; and (4) translate and disseminate results with potential for high impact. TranSTAR will provide: (a) transdisciplinary and specialized coursework and seminars, beyond required doctoral courses, taught by leading faculty in social work, public health, psychiatry, statistics, and the social sciences; (b) structured mentoring, advising, and hands-on experience, on funded addictions research projects through three predoctoral semesters of required research practice and in other semesters, research assistantships; (c) pilot study work groups and proposal critique review sessions; (d) predoctoral teaching assistantships in Master-level courses in addiction, comorbid conditions, statistics, and research methodology; (e) professional development sessions on presentation skills, effective communication of research findings, and soft-skills related to networking and effective collaborative team science; and (f) on-going, multi-faceted training in ethics and the responsible conduct of research. TranSTAR uses a three-tiered approach to on- going monitoring and evaluation of key program success indicators and achievement of milestones. We request funds for three predoctoral and two postdoctoral trainees per year to maintain a cohesive training cohort through the duration of training."
"9327468","Project Summary The goals of this project are to: i) investigate the ecology and evolution of the microbial genus Enterococcus, an evolutionarily ancient lineage of gut bacteria, and ii) provide training and career development opportunities to the Principal Investigator. In the anthropocene era, members of the enterococci have evolved from the gut of antibiotic-treated agricultural animals to emerge as multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens in the hospital setting. To understand the emergence of MDR enterococci, the ecological and evolutionary constraints that govern host colonization by Enterococcus spp. must first be understood. Thus, the long-term objectives of this research are to better understand the diversity and host-specificity of Enterococcus in the natural environment, and to understand the evolution of Enterococcus spp. in the context of a novel host environment. The first aim of this project is to develop a strategy to type species of Enterococcus, based on a core and unique gene shared by the species of enterococci sequenced to date. The investigator will then use this novel typing strategy for Enterococcus to profile a collection of 1,000 natural isolates of Enterococcus, to identify novel species diversity. Identified novel species will be used to expand the existing phylogeny of enterococci, which will then be analyzed with comparative genomic approaches to advance current understanding of species diversity and specialization for gut ecologies. The second aim of this proposal is to develop a model for experimental evolution of Enterococcus faecium. This model will leverage the genetic diversity of E. faecium to ask how differences in gene content shape the evolutionary trajectory with which a strain adapts to persistently colonize a novel host. To carry out this aim, a model will be developed to evolve mono-associated strains of Enterococcus faecium in the gut of the wax-worm Galleria mellonella: an invertebrate whose larvae are commonly colonized by species of Enterococcus. The diet of G. mellonella consists of pollen and wax: thus, the model will be informative for studying how the genomic attributes of E. faecium strains promote adaptation in the context of novel, diet-related selection. The genetic and physiological changes of the evolved strains will be compared to their ancestral states using transcriptional (RNA-Seq), and phenotypic (Biolog) analyses, as well as high throughput genotypic (Tn-Seq). Overall, this project will advance the understanding the evolution of Enterococcus in the context of symbiosis, and provide an enriching and worthwhile experience to the Principal Investigator."

"9285597","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Keloid disease is characterized by the formation of benign hyperproliferative lesions that develop in response to cutaneous injury. Surgical treatment of keloids is challenging, and patients suffer from high reoccurrence rates. These masses can lead to decreased quality of life as they can be cosmetically disfiguring, pruritic, and  painful. Clinically, keloids have been noted to form in areas of high tissue tension, including the  chest, shoulder, and back, suggesting a mechanobiology component to the pathological condition. These observations are supported by basic scientific research in which keloid fibroblasts have increased growth factor and matrix molecule expression when exposed to static stretch in two dimensional cultures. Furthermore, although keloid disease was initially thought to be the result of abnormal dermal fibroblast activity, altered epidermal signaling and vascular growth have also been reported in diseased tissue. It is therefore important to replicate the interactions of cutaneous tissues, in addition to mechanical stretch, when modeling the condition. Basic research and development of advanced therapies for keloid disease suffers from a lack of animal models or advanced in vitro models, as keloid disease presents itself only in humans. Microfluidic organ models are particularly well suited for the study of keloid disease as they result in high content research with small amounts of human cells. Typically comprised of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic chambers, these multi-layered biomimetic microsystems combine advanced techniques in microfluidics, biology, and tissue engineering to investigate how microenvironmental cues influence pathophysiological responses. Therefore, the objective of the proposed research is to first develop a skin-on-a-chip model, with an epidermal component cultured at an air interface atop a vascularized dermal component. This complex, three-dimensional microfluidic skin model will then be used to study the mechanoresponsiveness of keloid cells in response to dynamic stretch, aiming to replicate the pathological condition. Mechanically regulated pathways and nuclear translocation of gene expression regulating complexes (Hippo [YAP/TAZ] and TGF-? [Smad2/3]) with dynamic culture will be compared (normal vs. keloid). Finally, these pathways will be targeted with small molecules to determine if strain induced pathology can be mitigated, thus providing targets for clinical treatment of lesion formation. Completion of the proposed aims will result in the contribution of a versatile microfluidic organ model to the skin community in addition to enhancing the understanding of the mechanobiology of keloid disease."
"9472582","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection represents the most common viral infection transmitted in-utero and is a significant cause of neurodevelopmental disorders in children. The rate of congenital HCMV infection ranges from 0.2-1.0% of live births in the US and exceeds 1% in many parts of the world. Although maternal infection during pregnancy (primary maternal infection) represents a significant risk for virus transmission to the fetus and disease, infection and transmission to the fetus in women with existing immunity to this virus (non-primary maternal infection) is frequent. Disease in babies infected following non-primary maternal infection is well documented. Worldwide, including most US populations, the disease burden in infected infants born to women with non-primary infections exceeds that of offspring of women with primary maternal infection. In this proposal we will explore two mechanisms of non-primary maternal infections, reinfection with new strain of viruses and recurrence/reactivation of a persistent infection. Our goals are to define virological characteristics of non-primary infections and parameters of HCMV specific immunity in a highly seroimmune population in which non-primary maternal infections account for the vast majority of infected babies. We will also determine the incidence of the most common long term sequelae of congenital HCMV infection, hearing loss, in infected babies. We anticipate these studies will help identify host responses associated with intrauterine transmission and damaging fetal infections in this population of women with non-primary infection and could aid in the rationale development of effective prophylactic and possibly therapeutic vaccines to limit the morbidity from this congenital infection."
"9480909","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ionizing radiation (IR), produced by certain minerals in the Earth, represents a major environmental health hazard to man because it causes DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), highly toxic DNA lesions that often result in genome instability and cancer. It is well established that chromosomal translocations at DSBs can promote lymphoma development. However, there still remains a significant gap in the knowledge of regulatory mechanisms of the repair DNA DSBs induced by IR and lymphoma suppression. The BIR repeat containing ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (BRUCE) is a conserved protein with chimeric ubiquitin-protein conjugase (E2) and ligase (E3) activities that catalyze post-translational modification of proteins by ubiquitin. Until recently, BRUCE has only been shown to be involved in apoptosis inhibition, cytokinesis, and mouse embryogenesis. Recently, our preliminary studies provide the first indication that BRUCE is a suppressor of lymphoma and a regulatory protein in DNA-repair pathways. In particular, we observed that BRUCE mice are susceptible to lymphomas, and that cells with BRUCE inactivated display genomic instabilities and unrepaired DSBs following ionizing radiation. We also observed that BRUCE acts at a step upstream in DNA-repair cascade by regulating the accumulation, at the site of the DSB, of early DNA-damage signaling proteins and downstream repair proteins following IR. Furthermore, BRUCE has strong relevance to human health in that a reduction in the level of BRUCE gene expression is associated with human lymphomas and also correlates with low survival of lymphoma patients. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that BRUCE suppresses chromosomal abnormalities and lymphomagenesis by promoting DNA DSB repair. We propose two aims to test this hypothesis: (1) To determine chromosomal translocations in lymphomas developed in our heterozygous BRUCEWT/C mutant mice, and whether they are resulted from compromised repair of programmed and/or general DSBs in lymphocytes. We will also determine whether reduced levels of BRUCE protein are associated with lymphoma development by analyzing human lymphoma tissue array. (2) To determine the mechanism by which BRUCE regulates access of repair proteins to the sites of DSB and its implication in DSB-repair pathways of homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ, both classic and alternative). This proposed work is significant because it will be the first indication that BRUCE is a suppressor of lymphoma and a regulatory protein in DNA repair. This work is also innovative because it has never been expected or even speculated that BRUCE, an anti-apoptosis protein, could regulate DNA repair and tumor suppression. It challenges the current ubiquitin paradigm by placing BRUCE upstream of the current ubiquitin regulatory pathway. These results are expected to lay the groundwork for developing novel agents capable of modulating the level and/or the activity of BRUCE for innovative intervention of lymphoma other related diseases resulting from faulty DNA repair."
"9456112","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epidemiological studies show high comorbidity between dysmenorrhea and chronic pelvic pain (CPP) disorders such as painful bladder syndrome (PBS). Hormonal suppression of dysmenorrhea using oral contraceptives (OCs) is widely used to treat these conditions, but with variable results; their influence on the mechanisms involved in pelvic nociception remains unclear. Our long-term goal is to develop prevention strategies and effective treatments for CPP. Many female CPP conditions appear linked to repetitive menstrual-induced uterine inflammation and result in pain sensitization of adjacent pelvic organs, or cross organ sensitization (COS). The objective of this proposal is to identify the menstrually-mediated nociceptive, hormonal and psychological mechanisms responsible for COS of the bladder. In turn, we will explore which of these pathways underlie a reduction in experimental bladder pain following administration of OCs. Mechanistically, it is believed chronic pain involves impairments in descending inhibition, the brainstem pathway responsible for inhibiting spinal pain receptors. Clinically, this dysfunction is accompanied by widespread changes in pain sensitivity. We recently identified that women with moderate to severe dysmenorrhea exhibit widespread mechanical pain sensitivity and as well as vulnerability to bladder sensitization. In contrast with existing CPP patients, dysmenorrhea patients are ideal to study COS because of less confounding by anxiety or depression. However, dysmenorrhea patients with silent bladder pain (the D+COS phenotype) on experimental testing also have a key feature of PBS, prolonged pain following mechanical vaginal provocation, suggesting they harbor a high risk of developing chronic pain. Our preliminary data show OC usage is associated with less bladder pain, supporting the idea that hormonal suppression of menstrual pain improves nociceptive mechanisms underlying COS. Therefore, we will test the hypothesis that repeated episodes of menstrual pain reduce descending inhibition and increase vulnerability to COS, while continuous OC administration will reverse this deficit, through two aims. Aim #1: To determine if women with dysmenorrhea and concomitant bladder pain sensitivity exhibit neurophysiological features consistent with established CPP. Dysmenorrhea sufferers with and without COS and PBS patients will be compared with controls on experimental pain sensitivity tests, which measure descending inhibition and pelvic and bladder sensitivity. Aim #2: To differentiate the individual contributions of circulating sex hormones and repeated sensitizing events (painful menstrual periods) on descending and peripheral mechanisms of bladder pain with a trial of cyclic and continuous OCs. This innovative approach explores a unique pre-clinical phenotype with a battery of novel sensory assessments. This proposal is significant because determining the mechanisms underlying menstrual-mediated COS and their relative hormonal responsiveness is critical to improve CPP treatment. Developing a strategy to reduce early signs of bladder pain has the potential to prevent CPP."
"9488672","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Substance use disorder (SUD) is a frequent comorbidity following traumatic brain injury (TBI), even in patients without a previous history of drug use. However, the extent to which the neurological effects of TBI contribute to the development of SUD is unknown. The long-term goal is to understand how brain injury alters neurological and psychiatric function. The objective of the proposed research is to elucidate the relationship between mild TBI (mTBI), addictive phenotypes, and mesocorticolimbic function. The central hypothesis is that mTBI results in elevated risk for drug addiction and changes in mesocorticolimbic circuitry. This hypothesis is supported by correlative data from human studies and by preliminary imaging data using a preclinical mTBI model. The rationale for the proposed research is that understanding the neurological consequences of mTBI will aid in the development of therapeutic strategies for mTBI patients. To isolate neurological effects, we propose a rodent model to enable investigation of the effects of mTBI in drug naïve organisms with similar environmental histories. Our hypothesis is supported by epidemiological and preliminary data and will be tested in two specific aims: 1) Identify the impact of mTBI on drug self-administration, seeking, and relapse; and 2) Determine the effects of mTBI and cocaine on brain networks implicated in drug seeking. In Aim 1, cocaine self-administration and drug seeking will be measured in rats following mild TBI induced by blast forces. In Aim 2, structural and functional imaging studies will be performed before and after mTBI and cocaine self-administration. The approach is innovative because it will contribute translational imaging and behavioral data from a controlled and reproducible preclinical model to a field of study that has been dominated by human imaging and correlative studies. The project is significant because it will initiate a course of research that will reveal mechanisms of TBI sequelae and how these sequelae can influence drug intake and drug seeking behaviors. This work is expected to contribute to a body of basic research that will aid in the development of treatments for co-morbid psychological and psychiatric disorders following TBI."

"9486037","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Elucidation of the physiological regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is the key to understanding of the mechanisms causing its oncogenic activation. Growth factor binding to the EGFR triggers the signal transduction process. Receptor activation also causes rapid internalization and degradation of EGFR in lysosomes, leading to receptor down-regulation. This endocytic trafficking determines the number of active receptors in the cell and, therefore, the intensity and duration of signaling. Endocytosis also orchestrates EGFR signaling network by determining the localization and temporal dynamics of signaling processes. Importantly, EGFR endocytosis is frequently dysregulated in tumor cells. However, the mechanisms of EGFR endocytosis and the role of endocytosis and signaling remain to be poorly understood. During the previous cycle of this project we have defined the molecular mechanisms of EGFR degradation and ubiquitination, the major modification of the receptor that controls EGFR endocytosis. We have also demonstrated the complexity of the internalization step of EGFR endocytosis that is mediated by multiple redundant mechanisms. One of these mechanisms involves a novel post-translational modification of EGFR by acetylation. We have also developed new reagents, such as degradation- and internalization-impaired EGFR mutants, and used these new tools to demonstrate unexpected inhibitory effects of impaired EGFR internalization on tumorigenic signaling. Stemming from the new data and based on the availability of new technologies, such as high-resolution intravital imaging of tumors, ultra-fast confocal imaging of living cultured cells and quantitative mass-spectrometry, we propose to define the molecular mechanisms of EGFR internalization in tumor cell lines and in vivo models and examine the role of EGFR endocytosis in signaling in tumor models in vivo. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1) define the mechanisms of EGFR endocytosis, including the mechanisms and role of EGFR acetylation, under physiological conditions in cancer cells in vitro and in vivo in mouse xenograft models of head-and-neck cancer; 2) examine the effects of inhibited endocytosis and degradation of EGFR on tumor growth in mouse xenograft models and transgenic mouse inducible model of lung cancer; 3) define the regulatory mechanisms of EGFR ubiquitination and deubiquitination, and examine the potential of EGFR-specific deubiquitination enzymes as therapeutic targets in EGFR-dependent tumors."
"9307522","ABSTRACT Recurring losses of large chromosomal regions are a hallmark of pediatric and adult cancer genomes that pose exceptional challenges for uncovering how these deletions contribute to malignant growth. Monosomy 7 (-7) and del(7q) (-7/del(7q)) are recurring cytogenetic abnormalities in de novo myeloid malignancies that are strongly associated with cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) arising in children and in adolescent/young adult (AYA) patients with inherited cancer predispositions and in those who develop myeloid malignancies after treatment for a primary cancer. Therapy-induced MDS and AML (t-MDS and t-AML) are particularly relevant to the pediatric and AYA population due to modern intensive treatment protocols for many solid cancers, which are frequently curative. As a result, there is a large and growing population of ?at risk? pediatric and AYA cancer survivors. Unfortunately, t-MDS/t-AML and other myeloid malignancies with chromosome 7 deletions are highly refractory to current therapies. Extensive cytogenetic and genome wide analysis studies implicate deletions of chromosome band 7q22 in leukemogenesis; however, sequencing studies and transcriptome analysis did not reveal frequent homozygous inactivation of any candidate 7q tumor suppressor gene in myeloid malignancies. These data implicate haploinsufficiency for one or more 7q genes in leukemogenesis, which pose formidable challenges for elucidating the underlying molecular mechanisms. To address this fundamental problem, we deployed chromosome engineering to create 5A3+/del and 5G2+/del mice, which respectively harbor deletions in mouse chromosome bands 5A3 and 5G2. These deletions span ~4 MB of genomic DNA that is syntenic to the most common 7q22 deletions identified in human patients. 5A3+/del hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) exhibit ?preleukemic? abnormalities, but these mice do not spontaneously develop MDS or AML. Preliminary studies of 5G2+/del mice also revealed HSPC abnormalities and exposing this strain to N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) accelerated the development of hematologic cancer. We will utilize these novel models of 7q22 deletions to pursue the following specific aims: (1) to functionally interrogate hematopoiesis in 5G2+/del and 5A3+/del/5G2+/del mice and to observe cohorts of mice for the development of myeloid malignancies; (2) to investigate the effects of DNA damaging agents on 5A3+/del/5G2+/del HSPC; and, (3) to model the complex genetics of myeloid malignancies with -7/del(7q) by introducing cooperating mutations into 5A3+/del/5G2+/del HSPC and assessing the phenotypic and functional consequences in vivo. Genetically engineered mice that accurately model recurrent chromosome band 7q22 deletions found in human myeloid malignancies are a versatile system for performing functional studies and testing new therapeutic strategies."
"9333223","Program Abstract - Overall The goal for this renewal application is to a) elucidate oncogenic Kras (Kras*)-regulated metabolic pathways mediating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumor maintenance, b) define collateral metabolic dependencies, and c) establish how interventions targeting these processes influence tumor immunity, in order to guide the design of clinical trials with existing drugs and to identify new therapeutic points of attack. Our P01 program comprises 3 highly interdependent and collaborative projects and 4 essential cores with the goals of conquering PDAC through targeting metabolic vulnerabilities in conjunction with immunotherapy. Project 1 (DePinho with Draetta) has demonstrated that Kras* extinction in PDAC leads to pronounced tumor regression that involves critical functions of Kras* in metabolic reprogramming. We have also identified Kras*-extinction resistant cells (KRCs), which show dramatic adaptive metabolic changes (in OXPHOS and autophagy) allowing survival upon Kras* inactivation. These studies thereby provide benchmarks for successfully targeting Kras* in vivo and predicting resistance mechanisms that may be encountered in the clinic. Thus, the goal of Project 1 is to kill the bulk Kras*-dependent tumor cells through identification of metabolic targets essential for Kras*-mediated PDAC maintenance and to define methods to eliminate KRC through inhibiting autophagy and OXPHOS survival mechanisms. Project 2 (Bardeesy with Kimmelman and Cantley) has discovered that PDAC is dependent on lysosome-dependent nutrient scavenging pathways for metabolic homeostasis and tumor growth, and has identified a transcriptional program that activates these processes. The goal of Project 2 is to decipher how lysosomal scavenging supports PDAC growth and how cancer cells can escape their dependence on these processes, thereby informing improved therapeutic approaches. Project 2 will identify the metabolic outputs of lysosomal mediated recycling pathways, establish which of these outputs play roles in PDAC growth, and explore metabolic escape pathways in order to identify novel therapeutic combinations synergizing with lysosomal inhibition. Project 3 (Kalluri with Allison) has defined profound alterations in the tumor microenvironment, including a prominent CD8 T cell infiltration following Kras* extinction in PDAC. Project 3 will define the immune profiles throughout the genesis, regression and recurrence of PDAC and will determine the causal role of CD8 and CD4 cells in PDAC regression, as well as explore new opportunities to test the efficacy of checkpoint blockade therapy and assess the associated adaptive mechanisms underlying immune suppression. Furthermore, Project 3 will determine the direct impact of metabolically targeted therapy on tumor immunity and define effective methods to combine such therapies with immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Highly innovative cores for Pathology (Maitra), Preclinical Therapeutics (Benes), Computation (Futreal), and an Administrative Core will enable these Projects."
"9391758","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant: Prostate cancer is the most common non-skin malignancy and second leading cause of cancer death for men in the United States and is therefore a major public health problem. Localized disease is highly treatable; metastatic prostate cancer, however, remains incurable.  Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) by means of medical or surgical castration is the upfront standard treatment for advanced prostate cancer. Although initially effective, tumors become resistant to ADT, a disease state termed castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). It has become clear that CRPC is driven in large part by the intratumoral synthesis of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which permits a reengagement of the androgen receptor (AR). The dependence of CRPC on DHT is evidenced in part by the clinical efficacy of the androgen synthesis inhibitor, abiraterone. However, the metabolic mechanisms that induce DHT synthesis have not been elucidated. We have recently identified the first gain-of-function mutation in a steroidogenic enzyme that is responsible for increasing DHT synthesis and the development of CRPC. This mutation in 3?ydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-1 (3?D1) blocks ubiquitination, increasing steady-state enzyme levels and hastens metabolic flux from precursor steroids in what is otherwise the rate-limiting step for DHT synthesis. However, the mutation is present in a minority of CRPC tumors from patients; consequently, other changes that promote 3?D enzymatic activity, DHT synthesis, and permit the development of CRPC in the absence of mutant 3?D1 must be elucidated.  Our overarching hypothesis is that alternative mechanisms block wild-type 3?D1 ubiquitination, stabilize protein levels and compensate for the absence of mutant 3?D1, not only in CRPC models but also clinical tumors. Our current proposal will identify compensatory mechanisms of steroidogenesis that occur in the absence of mutant 3?D1. In Aim 1, we will identify whether expression of the ubiquitin E3-ligase, AMFR, is suppressed when wild-type 3?D1 is present.  Furthermore, we will determine how AMFR regulates DHT synthesis, the androgen response and development of CRPC. In Aim 2, we will define the clinical relevance of AMFR dysregulation in tumors from patients with CRPC, as well as matched clinical tumors that are abiraterone-na?ve and abiraterone-resistant. Together, these studies will identify and clinically validate compensatory mechanisms of steroidogenesis that circumvent the mutation in 3?D1. It is anticipated that this work will lead to the identification of biomarkers of treatment response and identify new treatment modalities for CRPC and thus will have a broad and potentially rapid clinical impact."

The BCC is comprised of an outstanding team of staff scientists who contribute sophisticated bioinformatics and statistical analyses to research projects and/or provide expert training in these methods. Additionally, it provides access to an array of high performance computing, data storage server and software resources, as well as custom programming and database development to support the research programs of Center Members and also data intensive applications of other Koch Institute Cores. During the current period, the Koch Institute BCC was merged with the Bioinformatics efforts of three other MIT groups to create a shared Institutional BCC. Moreover, significant investments were made to update and expand both the high performance computing and data storage capabilities using MIT funds. This resulted in a significant expansion in capabilities and the diversity of staff expertise, including the addition of in-house biostatistical analyses. It also created significant economies of scale. Consequently the requested CCSG budget for Year 44 is 15% less than the requested and recommended budget in Year 39. Importantly, usage of the BCC by Center Members increased from 37% to 59% during the current period. Moreover, Center members account for 74% of the bioinformatics usage of the shared BCC even though the requested CCSG support for this Core is only 52% of the total stakeholder contributions."
"9178071","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The extracellular matrix in vertebrates provides structural support to the cell, aids in osmo-regulation, and is particularly important in mediating cell-cell interactions in soft connective tissues, such as cartilage and skin. A major component of the extracellular matrix is hyaluronan (HA), which is an extracellular linear polysaccharide containing alternating N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) and glucuronic acid (GA) residues. HA affects many physiological processes, from cell adhesion and migration to cell differentiation and embryological development. Because of its broad impact on human physiology, a large number of pathological conditions, including many forms of cancer, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory processes, and rheumatoid arthritis, correlate with altered expression levels of HA. On a molecular level, HA is produced inside the cell by the membrane-embedded hyaluronan synthase (HAS). HAS is a remarkable enzyme. It not only catalyzes the synthesis of HA from UDP-activated substrates, but it also transports the growing polymer across the cell membrane to deposit it within the extracellular matrix. In order to accomplish this task, HAS has to fulfill several functions. The enzyme binds the substrates UDP-NAG and -GA, it catalyzes the glycosyl transfer reaction to form HA, and it translocates the growing polymer across the cell membrane through a pore formed by its own transmembrane region. To understand how HA exerts its physiological function and to produce HA polymers with defined properties for biomedical applications, we must first unravel how HAS synthesizes HA and how it deposits the polymer in the extracellular matrix. To this end, we propose three aims that will reveal the assembly of biologically active HAS subunits in native lipid membranes, will identify the interactions between HAS and the translocating HA polymer, and will allow us to determine the structure of HAS by X-ray crystallography. First, we will combine co-immunoprecipitation studies with chemical cross-linking and photobleaching techniques to visualize HAS oligomers in native membranes. The low-resolution structural data will then be integrated with high-resolution structures of monomeric HAS to reconstruct the native, membrane-embedded HAS oligomer. Second, the interactions of HAS with the translocating HA polymer will be mapped by introducing UV-inducible cross-linkers into the TM-region of HAS. Cross-linking during HA translocation will identify positions that are in close proximity to the polysaccharide, thus delineating the physico-chemical properties of the HA transmembrane channel. Third, biochemical and low resolution structural data will be integrated with a high-resolution structure of HAS obtained by X-ray crystallography. Determining the structure of HAS both in a detergent-solubilized but also in a membrane-embedded state will reveal the architecture and oligomeric form of the synthase, allowing us to delineate the mechanism by which this marvelous enzyme synthesizes one of the most abundant extracellular polysaccharides in the human body."
"9250770","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biomarkers are cellular, biochemical, or molecular alterations that can be easily and non-invasively measured in human tissues and are directly or indirectly in the pathway of disease. Air particulate pollution, also known as particulate matter (PM), induces lung and systemic inflammation and acute reductions in lung function and accelerated lung aging. The limited availability of biomarkers that reflect at-risk exposures and preclinical effects on lung function dramatically limits opportunities for effective targeted prevention. To address this gap, our long-term goal is to identify novel biomarkers that reflect environmental influences and predict the risk of impaired lung function. We will leverage experimental and clinical evidence on the roles of Extracellular Vesicles (EVs)-i.e., tiny membrane-bound vesicles actively released by human cells into the bloodstream- and of their bioactive cargo of microRNAs (miRNAs) as conveyors of inflammatory responses. Animal and human studies have shown that PM induces release of EVs into the bloodstream from the lung and other relevant tissues. In particular, PM causes release of EV-encapsulated miRNAs, which are key bioactive molecules that can control the expression of genes in recipient cells. Yet to date, no data are available on EV biomarkers as part of the mechanistic paths linking PM exposure to its adverse effects on lung function. In this proposal, we will leverage the resources of two well-phenotyped longitudinal cohorts, the Normative Aging Study (NAS, n=750) and the Cooperative Health Research in the Region Augsburg (KORA), our replication partner cohort (n=750 in the proposed replication set). In both NAS and KORA, we have access to repeated collections of blood samples, exposure data, and lung function measurements from serial visits over ~10 years of follow up. We hypothesize that the number, size, and miRNA cargo of blood EVs are modified in response to short- and/or long-term exposures to ambient PM (Aim 1); and that the EV number, size, and miRNA cargo are altered in individuals with lower lung function in blood samples concurrent to lung function testing (Aim 2.a) and/or in serial samples collected up to 10 years before the most recent lung function testing (Aim 2.b). We will establish and make publicly available a reference dataset on the tissue/cell type of origin of blood EVs and of their miRNAs; we will use this dataset to estimate the sources of EV-encapsulated miRNAs linking PM to impaired lung function (Exploratory Aim 3.a); we will use causal modeling to determine whether EV biomarkers affect blood messenger RNA expression, are linked to inflammation markers, and predict- through mediation or modification-PM effects on lung function (Exploratory Aim 3.b). Across aims, we will use detailed characterization of PM chemical components to capture their emission sources. Exposure assessment will also be informed by indoor measurements at 356 of the NAS participants' homes. EVs have increasingly recognized roles in health and disease. Therefore, our research may yield a model that could be eventually applied to additional respiratory risk factors and other age-related ailments."
"9386161","ABSTRACT Malaria is caused by the protozoan parasite, Plasmodium. It begins with the infection by Plasmodium sporozoites of the liver. This step is essential for the expansion of parasite numbers and the subsequent symptomatic erythrocytic cycle. Dormant liver stages formed by P. vivax are the major cause of malaria relapses. Therefore, inhibition of pre-erythrocytic infection will prevent malaria pathology and relapses from P. vivax. Current drugs against pre-erythrocytic stages have significant side-effects or are expensive. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new drugs against pre-erythrocytic stages. We propose to initiate a medicinal chemistry effort to optimize an inhibitor of P. falciparum's cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). PKG is essential for sporozoite invasion of hepatocytes and subsequent development in liver stages. Its chemical inhibition by a trisubstituted pyrolle (TSP) prevents liver infection in tissue culture assays and in mice. We hypothesize that optimization of TSP's physical properties will yield compounds with low dose efficacy against P. berghei liver stages. Our collaborative work combines expertise and experience in pre-erythrocytic stage biology and kinases, medicinal chemistry of kinase inhibitors and computational drug design. Our specific aims are: Specific Aim 1: Design and synthesize novel TSP analogs. Medicinal chemistry techniques guided by P. falciparum PKG (PfPKG) X-ray crystal structure will be used to synthesize analogs predicted to have improved potency and permeability properties. Specific Aim 2: Determine in vitro potency and liver stage activity of TSP analogs. Potency against PfPKG enzyme, whole-cell activity against P. falciparum erythrocytic stages and P. berghei sporozoite infection of HepG2 cells, ADME, toxicity and specificity studies will be considered in selecting parasite-selective compounds for testing in Aim 3 Specific Aim 3: Determine in vivo efficacy of TSP analogs. Compounds (single concentration, multiple dosing) will be tested through oral and intravenous administration to mice infected with luciferase-expressing P. berghei sporozoites. Liver stage infection will be quantified using luminescence measurements. Compounds that significantly inhibit liver parasitemia are likely to possess reasonable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics properties, appropriate for future optimization."

"9472616","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection represents the most common viral infection transmitted in-utero and is a significant cause of neurodevelopmental disorders in children. The rate of congenital HCMV infection ranges from 0.2-1.0% of live births in the US and exceeds 1% in many parts of the world. Although maternal infection during pregnancy (primary maternal infection) represents a significant risk for virus transmission to the fetus and disease, infection and transmission to the fetus in women with existing immunity to this virus (non-primary maternal infection) is frequent. Disease in babies infected following non-primary maternal infection is well documented. Worldwide, including most US populations, the disease burden in infected infants born to women with non-primary infections exceeds that of offspring of women with primary maternal infection. In this proposal we will explore two mechanisms of non-primary maternal infections, reinfection with new strain of viruses and recurrence/reactivation of a persistent infection. Our goals are to define virological characteristics of non-primary infections and parameters of HCMV specific immunity in a highly seroimmune population in which non-primary maternal infections account for the vast majority of infected babies. We will also determine the incidence of the most common long term sequelae of congenital HCMV infection, hearing loss, in infected babies. We anticipate these studies will help identify host responses associated with intrauterine transmission and damaging fetal infections in this population of women with non-primary infection and could aid in the rationale development of effective prophylactic and possibly therapeutic vaccines to limit the morbidity from this congenital infection."

"9287627","Epigenomic dysfunction at 16q24.1 ? vascular defects and perinatal consequences. ABSTRACT Heterozygous genomic deletions and point mutations in the FOXF1 cause Alveolar Capillary Dysplasia with Misalignment of Pulmonary Veins (ACDMPV), a neonatally lethal developmental lung disease. The vast majority of ACDMPV patients have additional defects involving heart, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary systems. The mesenchymal FOXF1 transcription factor expressed in the endothelial and smooth muscle cells plays an important role in epithelium-mesenchyme signaling, as a downstream target of Sonic hedgehog pathway. We accumulated the largest collection of ACDMPV samples in the world (N~145 families). Recently, we found that genomic deletions mapping in a protein-coding gene desert ~270 kb upstream to FOXF1 and leaving it intact manifest with the full ACDMPV phenotype. These deletions enabled us to define an ~60 kb tissue-specific enhancer region harboring long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), LINC01081 and LINC01082, that are expressed in fetal lungs. Another lncRNA, FENDRR that maps 1.7 kb upstream of FOXF1 in the opposite orientation and likely utilizes the same bi-directional promoter as FOXF1, interacts with chromatin-modifying complex (PRC) 2 to regulate gene expression. Interestingly, homozygous loss of Fendrr, leaving Foxf1 intact, leads to lethal defects of lungs and heart in mouse neonates. Importantly, we found that the FOXF1 locus is imprinted, likely using these lncRNAs; 31/32 of the characterized genomic deletions arose de novo on maternal chromosome 16q24.1. Trisomy 16 in humans, resulting from maternal meiosis I nondisjunction, is the most common prenatal trisomy (>1% of all pregnancies) and lethal unless rescued early embryonically. In one-third of such cases, children with maternal UPD(16) manifest IUGR (attributed to trisomic placenta) and multiple congenital malformations, including heart defects, pulmonary hypoplasia, tracheosophageal fistula, gut malrotation, absent gall bladder, renal agenesis, hydronephrosis, imperforate anus, and single umbilical artery. Interestingly, all the above clinical features, except IUGR, are observed in the vast majority of children with ACDMPV. In contrast, relatively normal phenotype was reported in few patients with paternal UPD(16), and imprinted gene(s) on chromosome 16 were suggested as causative for maternal UPD(16) phenotype. We hypothesize that FOXF1 enhancer and lncRNAs play an important role in genomic imprinting at 16q24.1, which may be responsible for the key features of maternal UPD(16). In aim 1, we will study the role of genomic imprinting of the FOXF1 locus in ACDMPV and UPD(16). In aim 2, we will analyze the function of the FOXF1 enhancer, including the overlapping lncRNAs. In aim 3, we will investigate the function of FENDRR in development and disease of heart, lung, and placenta. The proposed studies would provide a better understanding of the function of distant tissue-specific enhancers in genomic imprinting and the development and disease. This proposal would also elucidate the role of lncRNAs in enhancer function and gene regulation in general, and provide knowledge on this class of promising therapeutic targets."
"9266690","The intracellular movement of viral particles requires directed motor-based transport on long-range microtubule (MT) networks. However, the molecular details by which these dynamic host networks function during infection remain poorly understood. Members of this Program Project Grant (PPG) have observed diverse changes in MT organization and stability during infection with distinct RNA or DNA viruses. In addition, we have identified roles for specialized MT regulatory factors in mediating MT rearrangements and viral infection as well as key motors involved in Adenovirus bi- directional motility. As part of our Overall Aims to develop a truly detailed understanding of how these motile invaders interact with and exploit the equally dynamic MT networks of their host over the course of infection, we will establish the Imaging Core. Run by an expert in live imaging of organelle and virus motility (Dr. Richard Vallee), the Imaging Core will provide state of the art high temporal and high spatial resolution dual-fluorescence live imaging to support the individual Aims of each of the five members of this PPG. The capacity of this equipment will allow real-time tracking of viral particle movements and their interactions with host MTs at various stages of infection in living cells. This imaging system will also be used to develop new ways of visualizing stable MTs in living cells that should allow for the first time direct tests of trafficking of cargos on specific MT subtypes, as well as developing new ways of generating post-translationally modified MTs in vivo to define viral and motor protein interactions with specific MT subsets. We will also test the effects of plus- end tracking MT regulators on MT dynamics and stabilization and their influence on virion movement in living cells, as well as imaging the effects of infection on MT plus-end tracking protein activity. This will provide an unprecedented level of analysis of these highly dynamic processes and the role of specialized MT regulatory factors and motors, using novel approaches to explore the potential for selective use of dynamic MT capture versus trafficking on stable MT subsets by distinct viruses. To this end, the Imaging Core will provide a central state of the art resource to each PPG member and which plays a fundamental role in addressing the Overall Aims of this PPG to understand MT networks and virus trafficking in diverse viral systems."

"9325744","PROJECT SUMMARY Heroin abuse and addiction is a major public health problem in the United States. Although there are FDA- approved heroin addiction pharmacotherapies, deaths from overdose are on the rise and current pharmacotherapies possess unwanted side effects. Immunopharmacotherapy has emerged as an alternative treatment option for heroin addiction and preclinical evaluation of a heroin vaccine immunopharmacotherapy represents a critical component in the addiction medication development process. This proposal will determine the efficacy and specificity of a heroin-TT conjugate vaccine in two behavioral procedures in nonhuman primates, while also assessing the impact the vaccine has on pharmacokinetic parameters of heroin. Aim 1 will determine the effects of the heroin-vaccine on abuse-related subjective effects in a two-key food-reinforced fentanyl vs. saline drug discrimination procedure in three males and three female rhesus monkeys. Heroin and its metabolites 6-acetylmorphine (6-AM) and morphine will be administered in a cumulative-dosing test procedure to determine their ability to produce fentanyl-like discriminative stimulus effects. Next a heroin-TT conjugate vaccine will be administered and dose-effect functions will be redetermined. Aim 2 will determine heroin-TT vaccine effects heroin and its metabolites antinociceptive properties in a warm-water tail withdrawal procedure. The same six monkeys will be trained to sit calmly in a chair, and tails will be dipped in warm water heated to 38°C, 50°C, and 54°C and baseline latencies to withdrawal tails from water will be determined. Test sessions will be conducted after administration of fentanyl, heroin, 6-AM, and morphine. Following baseline test determinations, the heroin- TT conjugate vaccine will be administered and the dose-effect curves will be redetermined. Aim 3 will correlate heroin pharmacokinetics with heroin behavioral effects before and after heroin-TT conjugate vaccine administration. Heroin, 6-AM and morphine levels will be analyzed and quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography?tandem mass spectrometry. Overall, the proposed research will improve our understanding of the potential utility of immunopharmacotherapy for the treatment of heroin addiction."
"9251230","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal-dominant systemic connective tissue disorder that affects 1 in 5000 individuals. Patients with MFS typically develop aortic root aneurysms with ensuing aortic dissection or rupture remaining the leading cause of death. Previous studies have demonstrated that the underlying fibrillin-1 gene mutation in MFS increases the activity of transforming growth factor-? (TGF-?). Although TGF-? blockade inhibits aortic root aneurysm development in murine models of MFS, the molecular mechanism by which TGF- ? signaling leads to aneurysm development remains unknown.  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding single-stranded RNAs that function to regulate hundreds of genes. Our laboratory has reported that miR-29b plays a key pathogenic role in early aneurysm development in a Marfan mouse model (Fbn1C1039G/+). miR-29b is known to regulate genes involved in apoptosis and ECM deposition/remodeling. Importantly, how TGF-? increases miR-29b expression in a manner that is temporally and spatially restricted to the aortic root during early postnatal life, is not clear.  The aorta is a heterogeneous structure composed of three layers, the intima, media and adventitia. Lineage studies have shown that vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) in the different anatomic segments of the aorta have distinct embryological origins. Recent studies have suggested that the diversity of SMC origin may explain site specific location of aneurysm development. Our laboratory has developed induced-pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from human MFS patients and have successfully differentiated them into SMC from different embryologic origins (second heart field, neural crest cells and paraxial mesoderm). This in vitro model system will allow us to study how SMC origin influences regional differences in aneurysm formation. Complementary experiments will be performed using an in vivo Marfan animal model, thus increasing the translational potential of these studies. The overall working hypothesis that differences in the embryonic origin of smooth muscle cells lead to distinct miR-29b-mediated extracellular matrix remodeling and contributes to aortic root aneurysm formation in Marfan syndrome will be tested by the following two specific aims:  AIM 1: Determine if the miR-29b upstream regulators and downstream targets are different in Marfan human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived vascular SMCs from different embryologic origins.  AIM 2: Contrast the role of miR-29b in the development of aneurysms within aortic segments originating from distinct embryonic origins utilizing the Fbn1C1039G/+ (aortic root; second heart field) and Ang II ApoE (abdominal; mesoderm) mouse models.  This proposal will provide a mechanistic framework explaining aneurysm development in MFS. Investigating the pathways that participate in extracellular matrix (ECM) degeneration in the aortic root specifically might translate into more anatomically directed therapeutics."
"9488668","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Lipids play key roles in brain function and contribute in important ways to pathologies such as drug addiction, schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. In preliminary experiments, we utilized a pipette capture method originally devised for single-neuron mRNA analysis to collect individual somata of dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells - the smallest neurons found in the brain - from living hippocampal slices of adult mice. We analyzed lipid extracts of each granule cell by nanoflow liquid chromatography (nano-LC) coupled to high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MS). We were able reliably to detect many important lipids involved in membrane structure, energy storage, and cellular signaling. Importantly, we found that physiological stimulation of the lateral perforant path, a fiber tract that provides major excitatory input to DG granule cells, caused rapid and robust changes in the cells' lipid profile. The present application proposes to develop these initials findings into an optimized and validated protocol that can be widely applied to lipidomics analyses of neurons throughout the brain. We have two specific aims: (1) Method optimization. Our initial protocol is highly sensitive, but has three limits that stem from the vanishingly low amount of biomaterial afforded by a single neuron: (a) it covers only a fraction of the lipidome; (b) it allows tandem MS structure confirmation only for the most abundant lipid species; and (c) it provides relative rather than absolute quantification of detected lipids. We will (i) increase te sensitivity of our procedure through systematic modifications of key analytical parameters; (ii) extend the procedure's quantitative reach; and (iii) build reference libraries of lipid MS data for individual neurons, using pools of individually captured granule DG cells. (2) Method validation. Our preliminary work allowed us to identify a substantial number of lipid species in resting DG granule cells, and to detect specific alterations in the cells' lipid profile following physiologicl stimulation. To test the general applicability of the protocol, we will (i) profile the lipidome of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 and CA3 fields of the hippocampus, which are anatomically and functionally different from granule cells; and (ii) determine the impact of various physiological stimuli on the lipidome of DG granule cells and CA1/CA3 pyramidal neurons. Lastly, to define similarities and differences between single-cell and whole tissue preparations, we will compare the lipidomes of individual granule cells and micropunches of DG tissue under control and stimulated conditions. When fully validated and optimized, the present method will provide a flexible and robust new tool to investigate the roles of lipid molecules in identified neurons isolated from live brain tissue, opening exciting new avenues for research on neural lipids and the role of neuronal diversity in health and disease."
"9282619","The sequencing of the human genome has revolutionized cancer research. The Genomics Core is an Institutional Shared Resource, shared between the Koch Institute and three other MIT units, which provides Center Members with integrated and comprehensive services in genome-wide analyses. In the prior period, this Core (previously named the Microarray Technologies Core) focused specifically on microarray-based technologies. As part of a core-wide reorganization plan, the mission of this shared Genomics Core was greatly expanded in the current period. First, the Core took on the responsibility for providing all of our next generation sequencing capabilities (previously offered by the Biopolymers & Proteomics Core). Second, it recently established oncology-focused, high throughput small molecule and shRNA screening capabilities, with support from CCSG developmental and MIT funds. The Core also acquired new instrumentation and an expanded staff to support both of these activities. In the current period, the Core is used by more than 80% of the Center Members, including investigators from all four Programs. Thus, this Shared Resource is essential to the success of the Koch Institute mission. In the upcoming period, this Core will continue to offer a wide range of state-of-the-art genome-wide technologies to support the Koch Institute?s cancer research mission. Notably, Center Members represent 55% of the total usage of the Cores services, but the requested CCSG budget is less than 50% of the total stakeholder contributions."
"9253108","We propose a new clinical and translational sciences training program at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester (UMW) campus. Our current application is transdisciplinary ? a term describing investigators that work together to expand beyond discipline-based concepts, theories, and methods as a means to address a common research topic. Transdisciplinary teams work collaboratively to address a research topic, but through collaboration develop new questions originating from the cross-fertilization of disciplines. The proposed TL1 will engage pre- and early post-doctoral fellows in training across the entire translational spectrum to participate in a common clinical and translational science program. We have developed this novel training program because we recognize that to accelerate discovery and improve health, clinical and population scientists must understand and interact with the basic biomedical sciences. We will provide skills and experiences that position our trainees to uncover new knowledge that can be translated and implemented into the clinical arena for societal benefit; and inspire basic research based on human needs. Our collective institutional creativity and culture of collaboration support scientific inquiry across disciplinary boundaries, centers, and institutes. The specific aims include:  1. Train and nurture highly qualified pre-doctoral and post-doctoral trainees through the provision  of a novel, multifaceted, rigorous TL1 program in clinical and translational research.  2. Recruit trainees from national and local pools of eligible candidates, resulting in a diverse  trainee population with respect to clinical background and disciplinary perspective and with  diversity with respect to race/ethnicity, social disadvantages, and disabilities.  3. Provide trainees with the strong mentoring teams, rigorous academic training tailored to their  research interests, and technical skills necessary to ensure their success as independent  investigators and contributors to team science.  4. Provide ?hands on? research experience within transdisciplinary teams building on the  strengths of current linkages between UMW Departments, Centers, and Institutes. Post-doctoral trainees will complete the Master's in Clinical Investigation (T1 or T2+ concentration); pre- doctoral trainees will complete the clinical and translational science concentration. Our breadth of mentors, scientific disciplines, and academic programs offers the flexibility to individualize each trainee's experience while providing a strong methodological foundation."
"9454810","The precise regulation of the body's phosphate level is a critical task. Nearly all patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) exhibit hyperphosphatemia which is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. Renal reabsorption of Pi in the proximal tubule is hormonally regulated and requires fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and parathyroid hormone (PTH). The latter has been described to signal via cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), generated by adenylyl cyclases (AC), and retrieve Na+-Pi cotransporters 2a and 2c (Npt2a and Npt2c) and Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3) from the apical cell membrane. The overarching goal of this proposal is to determine the roles of adenylyl cyclase 6 (AC6) and NHE3 in Pi homeostasis by analyzing the intestine-kidney axis. We identified that AC6 is the most important isoform for PTH-mediated cAMP formation and Pi homeostasis. In contrast to the expected pathophysiology resulting in impaired Pi excretion, lack of AC6 causes renal Pi wasting with 80% of Npt2a residing in lysosomes. To avoid further Pi loss, PTH and FGF23 levels would be expected to be suppressed; however, lack of AC6 is associated with significantly elevated levels of both hormones indicating that this Pi loss cannot be countered hormonally. While regulation of the milieu intérieur would require intestinal Pi uptake to be enhanced or unchanged, we found that lack of AC6 causes an almost complete absence of intestinal Npt2b. This paradox highlights that AC6 plays a role in a so far unidentified negative feedback loop that suppresses Pi regulating hormones. Since PTH also targets NHE3, we generated a novel kidney-specific NHE3 knockout mouse to determine the contribution of NHE3 for Pi homeostasis. While this model has normal Npt2a abundance, Npt2c abundance is diminished, providing a novel link between NHE3 and Npt2c that has never been shown before. In Aim 1, we will determine the role of renal AC6 in Pi homeostasis under normal conditions and CKD. In Aim 2, we will delineate the contribution of 3 specific signaling pathways for Pi homeostasis: i) G?s protein coupled AC6/cAMP/protein kinase A; ii) G?q/11 protein coupled phospholipase C(PLC)/inositol triphosphate/Ca2+/protein kinase C; and iii) FGF23. A novel mouse model with defective PLC (named DSEL mouse) and AC6 signaling will allow us to study the contribution of each of these pathways in regulating expression of Npt2a/c in the proximal tubule. To determine the contribution of FGF23 signaling we will pharmacologically antagonize FGF23 via a novel neutralizing antibody. Aim 3 will determine if there is a linkage between NHE3 and Npt2c for Pi homeostasis. Based on the hypothesis that NHE3 is regulated by PTH, we will use our kidney-specific NHE3 knockout mouse to study Npt2a/c trafficking and colocalization and determine to which extent NHE3 is required for renal Pi homeostasis. Aim 4 will determine if AC6 and/or NHE3 play a role in intestinal Pi uptake and Pi homeostasis by utilizing novel intestinal mucosa-specific AC6 and intestinal mucosa-specific NHE3 knockout mice. Modulating PTH, FGF23 and active vitamin D levels will test for the regulation of Npt2b."
"9333228","Program Abstract - Overall The goal for this renewal application is to a) elucidate oncogenic Kras (Kras*)-regulated metabolic pathways mediating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumor maintenance, b) define collateral metabolic dependencies, and c) establish how interventions targeting these processes influence tumor immunity, in order to guide the design of clinical trials with existing drugs and to identify new therapeutic points of attack. Our P01 program comprises 3 highly interdependent and collaborative projects and 4 essential cores with the goals of conquering PDAC through targeting metabolic vulnerabilities in conjunction with immunotherapy. Project 1 (DePinho with Draetta) has demonstrated that Kras* extinction in PDAC leads to pronounced tumor regression that involves critical functions of Kras* in metabolic reprogramming. We have also identified Kras*-extinction resistant cells (KRCs), which show dramatic adaptive metabolic changes (in OXPHOS and autophagy) allowing survival upon Kras* inactivation. These studies thereby provide benchmarks for successfully targeting Kras* in vivo and predicting resistance mechanisms that may be encountered in the clinic. Thus, the goal of Project 1 is to kill the bulk Kras*-dependent tumor cells through identification of metabolic targets essential for Kras*-mediated PDAC maintenance and to define methods to eliminate KRC through inhibiting autophagy and OXPHOS survival mechanisms. Project 2 (Bardeesy with Kimmelman and Cantley) has discovered that PDAC is dependent on lysosome-dependent nutrient scavenging pathways for metabolic homeostasis and tumor growth, and has identified a transcriptional program that activates these processes. The goal of Project 2 is to decipher how lysosomal scavenging supports PDAC growth and how cancer cells can escape their dependence on these processes, thereby informing improved therapeutic approaches. Project 2 will identify the metabolic outputs of lysosomal mediated recycling pathways, establish which of these outputs play roles in PDAC growth, and explore metabolic escape pathways in order to identify novel therapeutic combinations synergizing with lysosomal inhibition. Project 3 (Kalluri with Allison) has defined profound alterations in the tumor microenvironment, including a prominent CD8 T cell infiltration following Kras* extinction in PDAC. Project 3 will define the immune profiles throughout the genesis, regression and recurrence of PDAC and will determine the causal role of CD8 and CD4 cells in PDAC regression, as well as explore new opportunities to test the efficacy of checkpoint blockade therapy and assess the associated adaptive mechanisms underlying immune suppression. Furthermore, Project 3 will determine the direct impact of metabolically targeted therapy on tumor immunity and define effective methods to combine such therapies with immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Highly innovative cores for Pathology (Maitra), Preclinical Therapeutics (Benes), Computation (Futreal), and an Administrative Core will enable these Projects."
"9270928","ABSTRACT: Environmental Health Data Science Center (EHDSC)  In support of our renewal application for the NIEHS-funded HERCULES: Exposome Research Center, we propose an Environmental Health Data Science Center (EHDSC). The Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) community refers to a ?data ecosystem? consisting of interconnected, mutually-dependent systems and elements. This ecosystem concept provides a helpful metaphor in the ?big data? setting where investigators often encounter data with high volume (many measurements), high velocity (rapid throughput), and high variety (very different types) and varying levels of `veracity' (accuracy) over time. All of these concepts are clearly in play within exposome research, both in general and within HERCULES projects in particular. The EHDSC consolidates the interdisciplinary expertise necessary to provide such support to HERCULES and facilitates the application of the exposome concept within environmental health in a more comprehensive fashion than could be accomplished by independent, individual project teams via three specific aims:  Specific Aim 1. Expand and foster a data ecosystem for exposome related research. The diverse and heterogeneous nature of data relating to the concept of the exposome demands flexible and adaptable support systems for data collection, integration, management, query, linkage, and analysis, while maintaining rigor and reproducibility. This aim adds an exposome perspective to NIH's broader BD2K effort, a perspective clearly relating to NIEHS goals but not a primary focus in current BD2K efforts.  Specific Aim 2. Expand and foster an analytic ecosystem for exposome related research. The data systems from Aim 1 mandate novel elements of both data analytics (rapid but broad scale summaries of trends and associations) and analysis (hypothesis-driven calculations assessing links between exposome data and detailed epidemiologic and systems biologic outcomes, models, and processes). The complex nature of the data requires the EHDSC to provide dedicated, diverse, interdisciplinary expertise to develop accurate and reliable computational and statistical tools for exposome analysis pipelines, particularly when dealing with asynchronous high volume and high velocity data streams of potentially varying accuracy.  Specific Aim 3. Expand and foster a collaborative ecosystem for exposome related research. The dedicated efforts in Aims 1 and 2 provide the workbench to support HERCULES pilot programs, assist with research proposal development, career development, and communication of scientific results to HERCULES community partners. Due to the rapid evolution of available data and tools for analysis, related training efforts for students, faculty, research staff, collaborators, and community members will be an essential component of the EHDSC allowing expert assistance in each step of the exposome research pipeline."

"9328651","ABSTRACT Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a familial disorder in which polymorphic ventricular arrhythmias are caused by intensely-felt emotion or physical exertion. CPVT results from excess diastolic calcium leak and carries high risk of sudden cardiac death. On the basis of family studies, most cases of CPVT are associated with mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RYR2), the channel by which calcium exits the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), or cardiac calsequestrin (CASQ2), the principal calcium store of the SR. While RYR2-associated CPVT clearly exhibits autosomal dominant inheritance, the mode of inheritance of CASQ2-associated CPVT presents a puzzle. Many of the known CPVT-causing mutations appear to require recessive inheritance for penetrant disease, despite the fact that calsequestrin, a protein that must dimerize and then oligomerize to perform its function, would classically be considered vulnerable to functional disruption by heterozygous missense mutations. It is not known why some CASQ2 mutations, such as the recently reported K180R substitution, clearly have dominant deleterious effect, while others are pathogenic only when carried recessively. We propose to resolve this conundrum via a thorough structural and biophysical study of the cardiac calsequetrin ?lament. We have succeeded in determining what we believe is the ?rst credible x-ray structure of the cardiac calsequestrin ?lament, revealing extensive buried surface area at oligomer contacts, as well as the ?lament's helical turn. We ?rst hypothesize that the oligomer forms from a series of calcium salt bridges, such that mutations at calcium-binding sites make the oligomer particularly unstable. In our ?rst aim, we propose to use x-ray crystallography with isomorphous calcium replacement to comprehensively map the calcium-binding sites of the calsequestrin ?lament, show that several known disease mutations are at ligand sites, and reveal that the oligomer requires calcium coordination in order to form. We also hypothesize that oligomer formation stabilizes dimers via extended all-by-all interactions, so that mutations that destabilize the calsequestrin dimer interface, when carried only in one copy, are rescued by the inherent stability of the oligomer at elevated SR-like calcium levels. In our second aim, we propose to demonstrate this rescue effect using biochemical assays and molecular dynamics simulations. In our third aim, we propose to model CPVT-causing CASQ2 mutations in iPS cells and demonstrate using a largely cell autonomous disease phenotype that the mutations that we have predicted on the basis of structure and dynamics to act in dominant fashion are in fact the ones that do so. The result of this project will be a new classi?cation of CASQ2 mutations, an understanding of which types of mutations (oligomer interface vs dimer interface) have which disease inheritance mode and why, and a much improved basis for helping clinicians and patients decide whether aggressive therapy - which carries its own risks and morbidities - is warranted."
"9269944","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the second renewal application requesting T32 funding for the UCSF Behavioral Neurology Training Program (BNTP), co-directed by Drs. Bruce Miller and Howard Rosen. The BNTP was established at UCSF in 1999 within the UCSF Memory and Aging Center (MAC) to train clinical researchers in behavioral neurology and neurodegenerative disease. Founded in 2004, this T32 is the only program at UCSF that allows junior researchers to gain an integrated understanding of the clinical, epidemiological, genetic, and molecular features of neurodegenerative diseases, and is one of the few programs in the world that provides intensive training on the non-Alzheimer's dementias and non-amnestic forms of AD. The goal of the program is to train postdoctoral clinical researchers for a career in neurodegenerative research. The program is open to MD neurologists, geriatricians and psychiatrists who have completed a residency. A core element of our program is accurate classification of dementia subtypes and prediction of the specific proteins causing neurodegeneration. Our training is designed to impart fellows with the skills to evaluate and quantify the effects of various proteins and other biological factors that cause dementia using clinical assessment and laboratory methods. Training takes place over two years. The first year consists of research rotations through four clinical programs at our center including our program project grant on frontotemporal dementia, our Alzheimer's disease research program, our rapidly progressive dementia program and our clinical trials program. During this year, fellows begin development of their research project with one of the program mentors and develop skills in scientific writing, presentation, and in data analysis using archival data from our clinical and imaging databases. In the second year, fellows are given more unstructured time to continue their research project and plan for grant submissions to support their future career in clinical research. Fifteen fellows have been supported directly by this T32, but the infrastructure developed through the T32 program contributes to the education of many additional postdoctoral fellows. In the upcoming cycle the training program will include improved statistical training and better access to statistical consultation, increased integration with the UCSF Division of Geriatrics, and better utilization of the training and faculty development resources maintained by the UCSF Clinical Translational Sciences Institute (CTSI). The quality and number of applicants for this T32 has grown dramatically, as has the richness of our environment. Therefore we have requested three additional training slots per year in this renewal to support three new fellows per year, and we will open the T32 program to neuropsychologists who have completed their PhD and clinical certification."

The program offers a 2-year experience dedicated to training in cell/molecular biology or translational research that is relevant to child health for 4 fellows per year and is designed to serve as a launch for a career that ultimately as an NIH R01-funded pediatric physician scientist. One of the key features of this program is that is can be used for training of fellows in a number of subspecialties within the Department of Pediatrics of the University of Pittsburgh that do not have a T32 grant (Allergy/Immunology; Cardiology; Genetics; Hematology/Oncology; Infectious Diseases; Newborn Medicine; Pulmonology). Thus, it can maximize the extramural support by targeting the most talented fellows and matching them with outstanding mentors. The mentoring faculty includes 25 outstanding researchers who have a distinguished record of research contributions and mentoring. The philosophical emphasis of this mentoring experience is fundamentals of the scientific method combined with the highest standard of excellence for rigor and integrity because we believe these are the characteristics of the training experience that are most likely to lead to a long successful career Each of the Scholars is expected to carry out a challenging research project in the laboratory of one of the faculty mentors leading to publications as well as an application for their own K08, K23 or K99/R00 grant. The Department of Pediatrics at Pitt has one of the fastest growing pediatric research programs in the country and is based on a new Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC campus with the new 300,000-square-foot CHP Rangos Pediatric Research Building. Based on these characteristics and our previous training results, we believe that this program provides a powerful team of mentors and intellectually-rich environment that will inspire pediatric subspecialty fellows and provide them with the background to become successful child health researchers."

"9275031","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is a revised renewal application for a highly productive Program Project, Biomarkers and Pathogenesis of MS: From Mouse to Human, comprised of three projects, a Statistical Core, an Animal Model/Human Tissue Bank Core and an Imaging Core that are focused on understanding mechanisms of pathogenesis of CNS inflammatory autoimmune disorders, especially multiple sclerosis (MS). Better understanding of the mechanisms of MS progression, and what underlies the continued axonal damage and drop-out would help guide development of new therapeutics for this common disease. Additionally, an urgent need exists for innovative methods to measure CNS inflammation, demyelination and axonal injury, as well as CNS repair, not only to better understand human MS pathogenesis, but also to expedite testing of novel therapeutics. A major innovation was achieved during our first five years with our development of the novel Diffusion Basis Spectrum Imaging (DBSI) which we now propose to definitively validate and carry forward to address current needs. Following encouragement and guidance from initial reviewers, we expanded our prior focus to encompass mechanistic studies of the communication between the invading inflammatory cells and resident cells in the CNS, leading to loss of blood-brain barrier integrity.  State-of-the-art imaging modalities will be used. The three P01 projects are linked thematically with the goals of defining the interface between blood-brain barrier signaling and immune cell entry and how this impacts the development of persistent inflammatory lesions, and axonal pathologies. The latter, in particular, may underlie progressive MS. Each project uses all three Cores that provide statistical, animal model/human tissue bank, imaging and administrative support. Overall objectives are to (1) develop and test novel cutting edge noninvasive and specific MRI biomarkers of white matter injuries using animal models, human tissues, and MS patients; and (2) to address and target the mechanisms by which changes in vascular permeability impact leukocyte activation and entry into CNS."
"9275991","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity and type II diabetes (T2D) have been increasing globally at epidemic proportions. Epidemiological studies indicate that air pollution is an environmental risk factor for development of insulin resistance (IR) and T2D. However, the mechanisms by which air pollution exposure causes progressive IR leading to T2D remain unclear. There is increasing evidence that IR, which often precedes the T2D by decades, may be modulated through epigenetic changes. Gestation and early childhood are periods of enhanced vulnerability to air pollution and also coincide with the stage at which epigenetic patterning is first established. We have previously established in mouse models that concentrated ambient pollution (CAP) exposure for >12 weeks potentiates the development of obesity, IR and T2D, and also induces a range of abnormalities that are prototypical for IR and T2D, including changes in immune function in systemic tissues (hypothalamus, circulation and adipose), reduced brown adipose tissue function, hepatic endoplasmic reticulum stress/steatosis and prototypical defects in insulin signaling in insulin response tissues such as liver, skeletal muscle and adipose. We have further demonstrated that early age is a period of vulnerability, as exposure to CAP during this period accelerates development of IR with overt changes in glycemic control developing in <10 weeks. Further, these defects are secondary to critical alterations in reactive oxygen species (ROS) pathways and inflammation in insulin responsive tissues. CAP exposure also results in genome-wide increases in in 5-mC. Hypothesis: Air pollution exposure results in global epigenetic alterations that result in metaboli re-programming in target tissues leading to obesity and insulin resistance. We posit that epigenetic programming during vulnerable periods of development (e.g. in utero or early childhood) is particularly prone to irreversible changes in the epigenome and the persistence of IR. This project will leverage access to state-of- the-art ambient exposure facilities, investigatie expertise in exposure science, disease pathways and epigenetics available at the University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins University to accomplish these specific aims. SA1: To characterize the epigenomic changes in response to air pollution that may either precede or overlap with the development of an insulin resistant phenotype. SA2: To define the IR and global epigenomic changes associated with early life CAP exposures. SA3: To determine whether cessation of air pollution exposure reverses insulin resistance and corresponding epigenomic changes. SA4: To integrate the epigenomic and transcriptomic perturbations that track with the development of the IR phenotype. These animal model studies with our well optimized controlled air pollution exposure that cause metabolic syndrome will reveal comprehensive epigenomic marks that precede the phenotype and are conserved between the target and surrogate tissues. The data will provide new leads for validation of mechanisms as well insight into interpretation of human studies."
"9482473","The Carolina Biomedical Data Translator (CBDT) will address the significant challenges in clinical and translational research by permitting clinicians, nurses, biomedical researchers, and clinical scientists to query, exploit, and contribute to a federated collection of complex and highly disparate data with medical importance. This data federation?a ?quasi-comprehensive? medical federation?will enable interrogators to pose questions about human health and disease that could not heretofore have been imagined. We anticipate that these analyses will increase, in ways that are paradigm shifting, our understanding of new treatments and treatment targets, mechanisms of disease and disease transmission, environmental triggers, opportunities for drug repurposing, molecular candidates, and systems biology pathways. To realize this vision, we propose a trajectory that permits the realization of such a federation. We intend to start modestly and prototype the CBDT using the unique tools we have been building for other informatics projects, and then iteratively improve the CBDT in collaboration with NCATS. Ultimately, the CBDT federation will need to be socialized, permitted, and nurtured in order to realize its full potential. Indeed, we believe that the biggest single challenge will be establishing a governance model that permits the assembly of information pulled from across institutions and organizations. We discuss this issue in Section 2.2.1. The CBDT must be: ? Dynamic: regularly updated to accommodate the addition of new data and data sources; ? Agile: modifiable for uses beyond the original design and adaptable for other data analysis; ? Usable: permitting differential access and levels of access (view, edit, etc.) to the data, and permitting use by both experts and new users with modest training; ? Rational: the data will be clinically and scientifically relevant, as well as informed by policy and protocols, and the system will provide answers with contextual meta-data; and ? Curated: the data will have associated provenance and quality measures, including statistical relevance where appropriate. We envision a dynamic system that supports data ingestion and subsequent curation, federation, and exploitation (see figure). We have assembled a team that has a track record of interdisciplinary collaboration and development of open source tools. We propose a demonstration project that is feasible in the 2-year time frame, but demonstrates all of the key functionality that the final system must possess."

"9275402","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         This proposal builds on prior studies to define the mechanisms responsible for the direct antitumor effects of the attenuated mycobacterium bovis, Bacillus Calmette-Gu?rin (BCG). Intravesical BCG remains the standard of care treatment for patients with high risk, nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer (urothelial carcinoma, UC). Unfortunately, BCG has significant limitations. Only 65% of the patients receiving treatment respond to this agent. Toxicity resulting from BCG's infectious potential limits its use to high-risk patients. With the goal of improving treatment efficacy, and/or decreasing treatment toxicity, the investigators have defined a robust set of intermediate endpoints for measuring BCG's direct effect on human UC cells. These endpoints include activation of intracellular signaling pathways, and transactivation of the genes for multiple chemokines, cytokines and white cell receptors. Signal activation/gene expression culminates in phenotypic changes characterized by cell-cycle arrest and apoptotic resistance. Subpopulations of cells undergo necrosis releasing the necrosis related chemokine HMGB1. As shown in the previous funding interval HMGB1 release is required for the in vivo antitumor response to BCG. The group's panel of endpoints provides insight into BCG's mechanism of action, and serves as a toolbox for assessing strategies to improve treatment outcomes.        The nature of the direct cellular response to BCG has led the researchers to hypothesize that cellular oxidative stress (COS), elicited by BCG binding/internalization, is a critical component of BCG's antitumor efficacy. Our published and preliminary data demonstrates that BCG serves as a free radical generator. Loss of BCG viability diminishes free radical production and the UC cell response to BCG across all intermediate endpoints. Downstream of the cellular binding/internalization of viable BCG, the researchers have demonstrated that transactivation of specific oxidative stress pathways and associated free radical production also are required for the optimal UC cell response to BCG. Pharmacologic enhancement of these pathways/free radicals potentiates the response of UC cells to viable and nonviable BCG.        This proposal will test the hypothesis that viable BCG's pharmacogenetic effects on UC cells, a requirement for antitumor activity, are a direct consequence of BCG generated H2O2 which serves as the trigger for COS and cell damage. Production of H2O2 by BCG, following binding to and internalization by UC cells, sets the stage for a second wave of cell-generated oxidants involving iNOS. Free radicals (superoxide and NO), and reactive molecules potentiate intracellular signaling pathways and downstream gene expression and result in a cellular phenotype that defines the BCG-treatment effect. Loss of BCG viability is associated with decreased H2O2 production, inefficient induction of COS and its direct consequences, and decreased treatment efficacy. Manipulation of contributors to the COS response to BCG represents an opportunity to enhance COS activity for greater antitumor effect. In combination with viable BCG such approaches afford an opportunity for greater treatment efficacy. When used with heat killed BCG these approaches promise to maintain treatment efficacy while decreasing the potential toxicity associated with viable BCG.        In addressing this hypothesis the proposed studies will meet two fundamental goals. First, the researchers will build upon existing data to complete their understanding of the factors contributing to BCG induced COS and COS associated cellular injury. By understanding the specific COS pathways activated in response to BCG, and the downstream effects of those pathways, the group will be poised to address their second goal. Specifically, to employ robust in vitro and in vivo systems to test strategies to potentiate BCG induced oxidant generation and oxidative damage in UC cells for improved treatment efficacy and/or decreased treatment toxicity. Selected treatment strategies will be translatable to the clinic in a way that will result in decreased tumor recurrence and progression rates and broader therapeutic applicability of BCG."
"9308853","The long-term goal of this project is to increase the cure rate of primary liver cancer by adapting treatment to  the individual patient response. This goal will be carried out through two specific aims. Aim 1 is to  complete a phase II clinical trial for patients with HCC in which the dose is based on the individual  patient's liver function. We will measure global and regional changes in liver function in patients  undergoing radiation therapy for HCC who are ineligible for or have progressed after standard therapy. We  will administer 60% of the treatment, wait the month that we have shown is required to express early liver  injury, reassess tumor response, liver function, and liver injury to adapt the dose for the rest of treatment,  based on a more accurate estimate of that individual patient's risk of toxicity. We will also assess regional  response in the tumor. We hypothesize that adapting radiation therapy based on the tumor and uninvolved  liver responses assessed during treatment will permit us to achieve a >80% 1 year tumor control rate while  causing no greater toxicity than standard therapy. Aim 2 is to conduct a phase II randomized trial to  compare standard therapy (fixed course treatment without adaptation) to the model proposed in Aim  1 that adapts therapy based on the individual patient's response. Aim 1 will provide the data to Project  4 to help develop a model for treatment that is predicted to maximize tumor response by intensifying  treatment to refractory subvolumes of tumor (defined by Project 3), and minimize uninvolved liver injuty by  delivering dose through non-functioning regions of the liver, and by knowing the radiation sensitivity of the  individual patient. This will be accomplished by replanning treatment after 60% has been delivered based on  tumor response and uninvolved liver injury. This arm will be compared in a randomized phase 11 trial to a  standard arm using an approach that bases the dose on the volume of uninvolved liver spared (which we  developed in an earlier version of this PO-1), but adapts neither tumor nor uninvolved liver dose and dose  distribution. We hypothesize that treating patients with adaptive radiation therapy based on the tumor and  uninvolved liver responses assessed during treatment will produce superior tumor control at no greater  toxicity than the standard arm that gives a fixed dose based on the volume of uninvolved liver irradiated (but  does not adapt therapy). The impact of this work is that it will develop a new paradigm for radiation  oncology in which treatment is optimized by adapting therapy to the individual patient response,  rather than based on the average patient."
"9251283","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intraocular pressure (IOP) and age are the most consistent independent risk factors for development and progression of glaucoma seen in all of the major prospective clinical trials, even though IOP has not been shown to increase with age in most populations. Glaucoma is also much more prevalent in persons of African ancestry. Lowering IOP is the only clinical treatment that has been shown to retard the onset and progression of glaucoma, but once damaged, the optic nerve head (ONH) is thought to be more susceptible to further glaucomatous progression even after clinical intervention has lowered mean IOP to `normal' levels. We have previously interpreted these findings to mean that the ONH becomes increasingly vulnerable to glaucomatous injury with age, African ancestry, and prior damage. There is a plausible alternative explanation, however. The ocular coats act as a shock absorber, and eyes with stiffer ocular coats have larger IOP fluctuations for a given perturbation. The ocular coats stiffen with age, stiffen with age more quickly in people of African ancestry, and stiffen after exposure to chronically elevated IOP. From these data, we might conclude that IOP fluctuations will be larger in both the elderly, persons of African ancestry, and in glaucomatous eyes in which the ocular coats have stiffened. We therefore hypothesize there are unknown age- and disease-related components of IOP (such as greater IOP fluctuation) that independently contribute to the onset and progression of glaucoma.  The fluctuation hypothesis predicts that IOP and OPP fluctuations are greater in the elderly and in eyes with a history of exposure to elevated IOP even if mean IOP is unchanged, due to remodelling of the ocular coats seen with aging and in response to chronic elevated IOP, and that these effects independently contribute to the risk for glaucomatous onset and progression.  Support for the fluctuation hypothesis would lead to an entirely new understanding of the importance of IOP and OPP fluctuation in the increased age- and disease-related susceptibility to glaucoma and provide strong rationale for totally new clinical diagnosis and treatment modalities that employ IOP and OPP fluctuation reduction through modification of ocular coats stiffness or intraocular damping of IOP fluctuations. If our results do not support the fluctuation hypothesis, the knowledge we gain about the natural fluctuations of these variables will redefine the appropriate IOP measurement frequency in patients and inform patient care."
"9266688","Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV) is a prototypical gammaretrovirus that replicates to high titer in neariy all mitotic rodent cells, causes a persistent viremia in infected mice, and induces a T-cell leukemia at a high incidence through insertional activation of host protooncogenes. Much of what we know about retrovirus replication was first learned through the study of the simple viruses such as the MLVs. In the eariy phases of infection, these viruses enter the cell through specific receptors, synthesize a DNA copy of the viral RNA genome by reverse transcription in the cytoplasm, direct the movement ofthe resulting preintegration complex (PIC) into the nucleus, and integrate the viral DNA into the host genome to form the provirus. In the late phases this DNA is expressed to form viral RNAs and proteins, and progeny virions are assembled at the plasma membrane and released to begin a new infectious cycle. In this project we propose to examine the early post-entry events of infection, the most pooriy characterized portion ofthe viral life cycle, focusing on a key host protein, IQGAP, microtubules, and dynein motors. We have previously identified IQGAPI as a major host protein interacting with the Moloney MuLV Gag matrix protein (MA), and have documented the critical importance of that interaction for virus replication. The IQGAPs are large cytoskeletal scaffolding proteins involved in the regulation of cell motility and morphology, and are noteworthy in binding and regulating both actin and microtubule networks. They integrate multiple inputs (especially from small GTPases) and produce multiple outputs, including stabilization of microtubules and capture of microtubule ends. We will determine the role ofthe IQGAPs in MLV infection, and the precise time and step in the life cycle at which they act. Using live-cell imaging of fluorescence-tagged virions, we will examine the trafficking of MLV mutants that do not bind IQGAP, and of wild-type virus blocked by dominant-negative fragments of IQGAP, to determine whether virions fail to be properly delivered to microtubules. We will test for the importance of phosphorylation of IQGAP, thought to be mediated by PKCe, in normal virus trafficking. Finally, we will test the key subunits of the dynein motor and dynactin for their roles in movement of the MLV PICs along both stable and dynamic microtubules. With the help of our cell biologist colleagues in this program, we hope to fill in a majorgap in our current understanding of the MLV life cycle. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Retroviruses are agents of serious human diseases, including leukemias and AIDS, and conversely hold out great promise as tools for gene therapy. Recent work has shown that these viruses are critically dependent on the cytoskeleton and microtubules (MTs) for their intracellular trafficking. In this proposal we aim to define the role of particular MT regulators and motors in eariy steps of MLV infection. Deeper understanding of these processes will provide new insights into retrovirus replication, potentially define new antiviral targets and increase our knowledge of trafficking of cargos on MTs."
"9316534","ABSTRACT The overall goal of this proposal is to evaluate cartilage composition of patients with hip osteoarthritis (OA) using advanced MRI techniques, and determine their relationship to development of cartilage lesions, patient function, and changes in hip kinematics and kinetics during functional tasks. The central hypothesis is that early changes in cartilage biochemistry and altered hip biomechanics are associated with progression of hip OA defined by worsening patient-reported outcomes and higher cartilage lesion scores. To accomplish this we need to establish the cross-sectional relationship of these metrics and natural history of hip OA over three years with the following specific aims: Aim I) To characterize hip cartilage T1? and T2 relaxation time, their spatial heterogeneity and anatomical location, and association of hip geometry (i.e. alpha angle, acetabular depth, etc), as a function of (I.A) KL grade and (I.B) annual follow-up time (Years 0-3); Aim II) To determine the relationship between hip cartilage composition (measured by MR T1? and T2 relaxation time, spatial heterogeneity, their anatomical location - Aim I outcomes) and disease progression as measured by (IIA) hip joint morphology (see Fig. 1- semi-quantitative MR grading1, adjusted for hip geometry such as alpha angle) and (IIB) patient reported outcomes (as determined by HOOS15); and Aim III) To determine the relationship between hip cartilage composition (measured by MRI T1? and T2 relaxation time, Aim I outcomes), and sagittal plane hip kinematics and kinetics during functional tasks (peak hip flexion angle and peak hip extension moments during gait, stairs, and sit-to-stand). A total of 144 hips across a range of OA severity will be included in the study. Advanced quantitative imaging, motion analysis, and functional testing will be performed annually over three years (baseline, 1, 2, and 3 year follow-up). This comprehensive evaluation of the associations of hip cartilage relaxation times, lesion prevalence, and biomechanics is the vital first step to determine the natural history of hip OA using non-invasive assessment. This information forms the crux of what is needed to design and assess the effectiveness of conservative (gait retraining, muscle strengthening), disease modifying drugs, and surgical (femoral and pelvic osteotomy, etc.) interventions at slowing or reversing the disease process."

"9333222","Program Abstract - Overall The goal for this renewal application is to a) elucidate oncogenic Kras (Kras*)-regulated metabolic pathways mediating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumor maintenance, b) define collateral metabolic dependencies, and c) establish how interventions targeting these processes influence tumor immunity, in order to guide the design of clinical trials with existing drugs and to identify new therapeutic points of attack. Our P01 program comprises 3 highly interdependent and collaborative projects and 4 essential cores with the goals of conquering PDAC through targeting metabolic vulnerabilities in conjunction with immunotherapy. Project 1 (DePinho with Draetta) has demonstrated that Kras* extinction in PDAC leads to pronounced tumor regression that involves critical functions of Kras* in metabolic reprogramming. We have also identified Kras*-extinction resistant cells (KRCs), which show dramatic adaptive metabolic changes (in OXPHOS and autophagy) allowing survival upon Kras* inactivation. These studies thereby provide benchmarks for successfully targeting Kras* in vivo and predicting resistance mechanisms that may be encountered in the clinic. Thus, the goal of Project 1 is to kill the bulk Kras*-dependent tumor cells through identification of metabolic targets essential for Kras*-mediated PDAC maintenance and to define methods to eliminate KRC through inhibiting autophagy and OXPHOS survival mechanisms. Project 2 (Bardeesy with Kimmelman and Cantley) has discovered that PDAC is dependent on lysosome-dependent nutrient scavenging pathways for metabolic homeostasis and tumor growth, and has identified a transcriptional program that activates these processes. The goal of Project 2 is to decipher how lysosomal scavenging supports PDAC growth and how cancer cells can escape their dependence on these processes, thereby informing improved therapeutic approaches. Project 2 will identify the metabolic outputs of lysosomal mediated recycling pathways, establish which of these outputs play roles in PDAC growth, and explore metabolic escape pathways in order to identify novel therapeutic combinations synergizing with lysosomal inhibition. Project 3 (Kalluri with Allison) has defined profound alterations in the tumor microenvironment, including a prominent CD8 T cell infiltration following Kras* extinction in PDAC. Project 3 will define the immune profiles throughout the genesis, regression and recurrence of PDAC and will determine the causal role of CD8 and CD4 cells in PDAC regression, as well as explore new opportunities to test the efficacy of checkpoint blockade therapy and assess the associated adaptive mechanisms underlying immune suppression. Furthermore, Project 3 will determine the direct impact of metabolically targeted therapy on tumor immunity and define effective methods to combine such therapies with immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Highly innovative cores for Pathology (Maitra), Preclinical Therapeutics (Benes), Computation (Futreal), and an Administrative Core will enable these Projects."
"9252585","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Antiretroviral treatment (ART) markedly reduces the risk of HIV transmission between stable HIV discordant heterosexual partners and increasing ART use can effect population-level reductions in HIV incidence. Whether or not HIV prevention interventions, such as ART Treatment as Prevention (TasP) strategies can significantly reduce epidemic growth rates remains a matter of considerable debate, though current community-randomized TasP trials will require vast infrastructure and financial resources. Alternative, less resource-prohibitive approaches are needed, that ideally would also provide real-time insight into HIV transmission dynamics and be easily modified to address unique regional and epidemiological factors. Prospective studies of prevention and treatment interventions that target epidemiologic hot spots of HIV transmission may provide an opportunity to efficiently interrupt HIV transmission chains. Effective prevention interventions ar particularly relevant in populations of men who have sex with men (MSM) since their incidence rates are disproportionately high compared to other risk groups. We propose to use molecular epidemiology and computational modeling to estimate in real time the risk of onward HIV transmission in newly HIV diagnosed persons. We have shown that by evaluating HIV sequences that are generated in 'real- time' after a participant is identified from our San Diego Primary HIV infection Cohort (SD PIC), a partial transmission network can be inferred rapidly and reliably, and this network can be leveraged to better measure the efficacy of treatments and interventions, correlates of transmission risk, and estimate the size and features of the San Diego HIV epidemic. The proposed study will also address concerns related to patient confidentiality, specifically - unintended disclosure of HIV status or a putative transmission link We will develop sophisticated quantitative methods to preserve privacy prior to future consideration of potential public health applications. Our primary hypothesis is that the efficacy of HIV prevention interventions, such as TasP (i.e., ART), can be measured within a well-characterized MSM epidemic, using network statistics to assess real time changes in HIV transmission dynamics within the population. This proposal will address the following Specific Aims: 1) To infer the San Diego HIV transmission network using molecular epidemiology and use agent-based simulations to estimate features of the underlying infected population and efficacy of potential interventions, 2) To assess the potential of molecular epidemiology and network statistics to measure the efficacy of ART as a network-based prevention intervention, by comparing HIV transmission rates in persons who initiate early ART compared to those who either delay or decline ART, and 3) To develop and deploy privacy preserving methods for computing transmission network statistics. These same methods could be easily replicated in a prospective fashion across diverse HIV epidemics and could help to prioritize interventions within the scope of available resources."

"9088355","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mutations in bone stem cells can impair bone metabolism and regeneration. Osteogenesis imperfect (OI) is the most common form of genetic bone disease and characterized by bone fragility with clinical manifestations varying from a mild increase in fractures to severe bone deformities and death. Individuals with OI have mutations that alter procollagen structure or production and lead to abnormal collagen fibril formation disrupting bone development and renewal. Treatment options for OI are limited and do not alleviate the complications seen in OI. Our recent work has demonstrated that AAV gene targeting vectors can disrupt the mutant collagen alleles that cause OI and that targeted cells produced normal collagen and formed bone. While these results indicate the effectiveness of genomic editing with targeting frequencies approaching 1%, an enhancement of AAV gene targeting is required to provide more robust in vivo genetic manipulations. Here we will expand upon our successes and propose three lines of investigations to develop a therapeutic approach for patients with inherited bone disease. First we will modify collagen genes using a CRISPR-AAV system that will allow for the disruption or correction of genes that cause OI in vivo. Second, we will investigate whether genetically corrected bone stem cells have a growth advantage in vivo and how TGF-beta signaling affects the extra-skeletal manifestations of bone disease. Finally we will conduct a series of experiments in a preclinical rabbit model to establish the optimal gene targeting delivery protocol. Successful completion of this proposal will lead to an improved understand of TGF-beta signaling and stem cell kinetics in bone and advance AAV gene targeting toward a clinical trial."

"9387832","Summary Apicomplexan parasites are responsible for severe human diseases. Drug resistance and/or poor specificity are constantly undermining therapeutic regimens to treat these diseases. In order to identify new drug targets, the P.I.'s lab focuses on deepening the understanding of cell biological processes wherein the parasite differs from its host using Toxoplasma gondii as model apicomplexan. In this proposal they will address such distinct structure: the basal complex (BC), which sits at the posterior end of the unique cortical membrane skeleton of these parasites. Historically, interest in the BC stems from its function as the contractile ring driving cell division. Basal complex contraction is powered by an as yet undefined mechanism independent of actin- myosin setting it apart from the host. More recently, the BC has also been associated with other processes such as assembly of the tubulovesicular intravacuolar network (IVN), which operates as an exchanger between parasite and host cell and is additionally essential to establish a chronic infection. Contractile rings in other systems are composed of 125+ proteins, yet only 22 BC proteins are known. To decipher the molecular mechanisms behind the BC's diverse functions, it is proposed to assemble its complete parts list through an in vivo proximity-based biotinylation approach (BioID). Since BioID provides short-distance interaction information in the native complex inside the parasite, a topical model of BC architecture is within reach. To that end half the known BC components will be tagged as baits in BioID. Proof of principle experiments already generated several new insights underscoring the feasibility of this approach. Quantitative mass spectrometry data will be used to assemble a protein-protein interaction (PPI) map, which is expected to identify both clusters within the basal complex and nodes that make connections with many components. Clusters are expected to align with different compartments observed by (ultra)structural studies. Nodes will highlight potential key organizers of (sub)structures, which makes them good targets for functional studies. To maximize the depth of biological insights that can be realistically achieved under this proposal, 10 key candidates will be prioritized based on PPI map position and biological signature. Their spatiotemporal dynamics throughout parasite development and localization within the BC will be tracked by auto-fluorescent and/or epitope tags. Dynamical changes likely align with different assembly steps and/or functions of the BC. Furthermore, 5 candidates among the 10 primary picks representing as much diversity as possible will be selected for the generation of (conditional) gene knock-out (KO) strains. The KO strains will be evaluated for defects in BC assembly, morphology and constriction as well as IVN formation, morphology and function in uptake of host cell nutrients. Altogether, these data will help to resolve structure-function relationships and provide a hint at molecular interplay and mechanisms underlying the various BC functions. These insights will guide future mechanistic studies and development of specific new drugs."
"9247847","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor TCF4 (aka E2-2) has been implicated broadly in human CNS function. TCF4 was confirmed in several large GWAS studies as one of the rare highly replicated schizophrenia susceptibility genes, and when haplo-insufficient TCF4 is the causative factor for Pitt-Hopkins Syndrome (PTHS). PTHS has compelling attributes in terms of human cognitive function, being associated with pronounced memory deficits, autistic behaviors, and importantly an almost complete lack of language development. Thus, understanding the roles and function of TCF4 in the CNS is highly significant with respect to human language and auditory cognition, memory function, autism spectrum behavior, and schizophrenia susceptibility. Despite the clear importance of TCF4 function in the human CNS, the basic neurobiology of TCF4 has been only sparsely studied. Thus, this Project will use genetically engineered mouse models to assess the role of TCF4 in memory, social interactions and communication, hippocampal synaptic plasticity, synaptic anatomy, and epigenomic and transcriptional regulation in the CNS. The central hypothesis of the proposed studies is that TCF4 regulates the brain's ability to trigger long-term synaptic plasticity and memory formation by actively regulating transcriptional activity in response to behavioral experience. The approach will be to use both germline constitutive knockout and acute knockdown or deletion of TCF4 in the adult mouse hippocampus, coupled with extensive behavioral, electrophysiological, and transcriptomic/epigenomic characterization, to determine if TCF4 function is necessary in an ongoing fashion for normal memory and synaptic plasticity in the mature CNS. The studies will capitalize not only upon the available germline knockout line but also upon an already-available floxed TCF4 allele mouse line, and combine these mice with both virus- driven cre expression in the adult hippocampus and post-developmental CaMKII promoter-driven forebrain neuron-selective cre expression to achieve inducible post-developmental attenuation of CNS TCF4 function in vivo. Using these novel mouse models we will undertake three Specific Aims. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that TCF4-deficient mice exhibit cognitive memory and social interaction deficits, and also test the hypothesis that TCF4-deficient mice exhibit altered synaptic plasticity. Aim 2 will comprise a significant translational component of the studies and will test the hypothesis that transcription-promoting Histone DeAcetylase Inhibitors (HDACi) will restore learning, memory, and synaptic plasticity in TCF4-deficient mice, as proof-of- concept that behavioral deficits and plasticity deficits in PTHS model mice can be reversed pharmacologically with HDACi. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that loss of TCF4 function triggers secondary alterations in chromatin structure, DNA methylation, and gene transcription in the mature CNS. Toward this end, we will use the unbiased approach of utilizing MBD-seq, mRNA-seq, and small RNA-seq approaches for a comprehensive analysis of potential transcriptomic and epigenomic alterations in TCF4-deficient mice."

"9333225","Program Abstract - Overall The goal for this renewal application is to a) elucidate oncogenic Kras (Kras*)-regulated metabolic pathways mediating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumor maintenance, b) define collateral metabolic dependencies, and c) establish how interventions targeting these processes influence tumor immunity, in order to guide the design of clinical trials with existing drugs and to identify new therapeutic points of attack. Our P01 program comprises 3 highly interdependent and collaborative projects and 4 essential cores with the goals of conquering PDAC through targeting metabolic vulnerabilities in conjunction with immunotherapy. Project 1 (DePinho with Draetta) has demonstrated that Kras* extinction in PDAC leads to pronounced tumor regression that involves critical functions of Kras* in metabolic reprogramming. We have also identified Kras*-extinction resistant cells (KRCs), which show dramatic adaptive metabolic changes (in OXPHOS and autophagy) allowing survival upon Kras* inactivation. These studies thereby provide benchmarks for successfully targeting Kras* in vivo and predicting resistance mechanisms that may be encountered in the clinic. Thus, the goal of Project 1 is to kill the bulk Kras*-dependent tumor cells through identification of metabolic targets essential for Kras*-mediated PDAC maintenance and to define methods to eliminate KRC through inhibiting autophagy and OXPHOS survival mechanisms. Project 2 (Bardeesy with Kimmelman and Cantley) has discovered that PDAC is dependent on lysosome-dependent nutrient scavenging pathways for metabolic homeostasis and tumor growth, and has identified a transcriptional program that activates these processes. The goal of Project 2 is to decipher how lysosomal scavenging supports PDAC growth and how cancer cells can escape their dependence on these processes, thereby informing improved therapeutic approaches. Project 2 will identify the metabolic outputs of lysosomal mediated recycling pathways, establish which of these outputs play roles in PDAC growth, and explore metabolic escape pathways in order to identify novel therapeutic combinations synergizing with lysosomal inhibition. Project 3 (Kalluri with Allison) has defined profound alterations in the tumor microenvironment, including a prominent CD8 T cell infiltration following Kras* extinction in PDAC. Project 3 will define the immune profiles throughout the genesis, regression and recurrence of PDAC and will determine the causal role of CD8 and CD4 cells in PDAC regression, as well as explore new opportunities to test the efficacy of checkpoint blockade therapy and assess the associated adaptive mechanisms underlying immune suppression. Furthermore, Project 3 will determine the direct impact of metabolically targeted therapy on tumor immunity and define effective methods to combine such therapies with immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Highly innovative cores for Pathology (Maitra), Preclinical Therapeutics (Benes), Computation (Futreal), and an Administrative Core will enable these Projects."

"9459656","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research is to develop a prototype tool that will ultimately improve cancer therapy. A major bottleneck in testing new cancer drugs is in the early phases of assessing drug activity, typically in phase II trials. The tool will combne computational methods of assessing cancer patients' tumor burden on CT images with new computational models of tumor growth over time. This systematic project will combine expertise among academic physician scientists in clinical pharmacology, oncology, and imaging with industry computational pharmacologists to develop a prototype tool for analyzing tumor burden and designing new, more efficient, clinical trials that could reduce the number of patients needed to test a new drug. This tool is also expected to enable investigators to better identify subsets of patients who are having greater benefits from treatment than others. Aim 1 entails computing the volume of tumors (rather than just single longest dimensions) for more than 900 patients each with colorectal, lung, and renal cancer and then establishing new longitudinal models of tumor growth based on the volumetric assessments. Aim 2 will project the earliest time points at which the tumor volume measurements detect treatment effects, simulate clinical trials based on the data in Aim 1 and validate the findings with prospective study of 90 cancer patients. Based on these findings, in Aim 3 the investigators will test the prototype tool by conducting prospective phase II trials with the new volumetric assessment and computational modeling-based study designs. As CT is the most common imaging modality for cancer, the new algorithms run on popular imaging platforms could then be readily implemented on a large scale."

"9359404","Abstract - Core C (Computational Core)  The DNA and RNA next generation sequencing and experimental data generated by Projects 1 ? 3 require  trained bioinformaticians to process the data and conduct the downstream analysis to help the project  investigators interpret the results and identify target genes for validation. Over the past years, the  Computational Core has developed an infrastructure with powerful computing clusters, storage space, and  well-established software to conduct the computations required. We have also been working closely with  Project 1 and Core B (Preclinical Therapeutics Core) investigators to develop and improve the algorithms  for tracking molecular barcodes in vivo in order to to accurately evaluate genes for their tumor initiating  potentials and to identify targets for clinical treatments of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The following  three specific aims are proposed:  1. One significant contribution the Computational Core can make is to conduct integrative analysis  leveraging readily available MDACC internal patients and external public data sources to seek for answers,  formulate hypothesis, and validate the experimental results with dedicated computational biologists. We will  mine the private and public databases to provide information needed to guide the experiments and the  validation of the experimental results. Databases or archives containing data collected from TCGA, CCLE,  COSMIC, and MD Anderson Cancer Center's patient data repositories have been built with interfaces and  applications to facilitate exploration, and visualization have been developed. Data mining results will be  communicated with project investigators.  2. We will provide P01 investigators with statistical analysis of RNASeq gene expression data to identify  differentially expressed genes between genomic groups, disease subtypes, or treatment conditions to  identify biomarkers. A collection of publically available and internally developed tools have been configured  to run on the computing cluster that can be selected based on the nature of the experiment and data  structure. We will also further improve the algorithm we have developed for in vivo screening projects to  identify genes as potential targets of treatments.  3. We will process the next generation sequencing data following established standards and implement  quality control measures at each step to produce high quality data that can be used for downstream  analysis to identify target genes with clinical implications. A production level infrastructure has been  established to ensure the achievement of this goal."

It is therefore essential for all laboratories investigating causes and potential cures for diabetes to be able to study islet function in relation to their specific models and molecules of interest. The objective of the Islet Cell Biology Core (ICBC) is to provide DRC members with state of the art support including experiment design, islet isolation, and performance of and/or training in an expansive range of assays for physiological and morphometric assessment of pancreatic islet function and growth. This will be accomplished through four Aims: Aim 1: To provide islet isolation service and training: We will continue to offer islet isolation services using rodent animal models. Depending on the needs of specific investigators, the ICBC provides training for graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and research staff in pancreatic islet isolation techniques. Aim 2: To provide state of the art assays for physiological assessment of islet function: We will continue to provide consultation on experimental design and to offer a broad range of assays of pancreatic islet function, including batch incubation and perifusion, islet and cell fluorescence imaging (Cai2+), mitochondrial function assays by Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analyzer, perifusion coupled with respirometry, and closed respirometry. We will continue to provide access and instruction for quantitative imaging of pancreatic islet mass. The ICBC provides training in perfusion techniques, in basic principles of respiration and oxidative phosphorylation and measurement of oxygen consumption by different methods, and in all aspects of islet cell physiology and biochemistry. Aim 3: To pursue procedural and equipment advances: We will support the studies of collaborators at Penn and CHOP involving human islets affected by a range of pathophysiological conditions. We will also adapt our technology and expertise to the analysis of non-islet, metabolically relevant tissues, reflecting the complex, intercommunicating, multi-organ control required to maintain normal glucose homeostasis. Technological advances will include equipment upgrades and expansion of services to include measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential and perifusion of dispersed primary islet cells in a 6 well plate format. Aim 4: To embark on a new initiative for islet cell electrophysiology: Prompted by the research needs of DRC investigators, we established collaboration with our Physiology Department, widely acknowledged for excellence in cell membrane biophysics, to provide expert consultation and experimental services in this crucial aspect of pancreatic islet cell biology and disease. In sum, the Islet Cell Biology Core is well aligned with the overall goals of the DRC, enabling investigators to perform state of the art basic and clinical research. Correlation of our phenotypic analysis performed on genetically altered or metabolically challenged mice or human source material with in vivo metabolic phenotyping and high throughput sequencing performed by other DRC cores will deepen our insights with the potential for therapeutic translation."

"9308858","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  The goal of Core B Is to provide the clinically-focused infrastructure, support, and continuity necessary to implement individualized adaptive radiation therapy for patients treated in Projects 1 and 2. Gore C personnel provide the logistical support to acquire high fidelity imaging of patients during imaging studies spanning from simulation through pre-treatment imaging and treatment assessment. Cone beam GT or other data acquired as part of individual treatment fractions is collected by Core B and processed utilizing tools from Gores G and D to create an up-to-date patient model of the accumulated dose distribution based on the number of treated fractions. Gore B personnel will re-optimize individual patient plans using the up-to date model of accumulated dose based on anatomic imaging (CBCT) combined with what has been learned with physiologic imaging to tailor a new treatment plan based on the subvolumes analysis by Gore G. Gore B personnel will implement initial and new treatment plans and monitor the patient's progress. The gathered information will also be supplied to Gore D to support their development of decision support tools for clinical use. Gore B personnel will also develop tools and techniques to verify the integrity of imaging systems across multiple hardware and software platforms by utilizing novel phantoms to assess the spatial and signal accuracy of different imaging systems. This information will be used to estimate the baseline uncertainty that applies to all imaging studies when customized fiducials are utilized across imaging systems. Core B personnel will also develop methods to verify the accuracy of the calculated delivered dose by utilizing portal imaging technology and other methods (such as machine log files) to simulate the delivered dose for specific treatment fractions as appropriate. By validating estimates of the delivered dose, Core B can provide information that can be used to evaluate the need for such information. Determining the validity of this approach is critical for patient treatments where there are gross anatomical changes such as tumor shrinkage.These methods have the potential to streamline quality assurance processes so that all adaptations to the patient's treatments are performed in a safe, timely and efficient manner."
"9250213","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): Oxytocin (OT) functions as a neuromodulator in the central nervous system (CNS) to promote social behavior and affiliation in animals and. Because of its prosocial effects, researchers have begun to explore whether OT could be used as a novel pharmacotherapy to treat a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by social impairments, such as autism. Indeed, several studies have now emerged suggesting that intranasally administered (IN) OT can improve prosocial behavior in adults with high-functioning autism, including cooperation, reading facial expressions, and directing attention to the eye region in faces . However, the exact mechanisms by which IN-OT influence prosocial behavior in primates remain unclear, including whether OT acts centrally in the brain through the oxytocin receptor system (OXTR) or through peripheral feedback. Therefore, while OT is an extremely attractive potentials pharmacotherapy that could function to ameliorate social impairments and enhance prosocial behavior in humans, many questions remain about its mechanism of action and overall function. This is particularly true in nonhuman primates. Although they represent an ideal preclinical model for screening the behavioral and neurobiological effects of OT, only a handful of studies investigated the effect of OT on nonhuman primate social cognition. It is the goal of this study to compare the effect of IN-OT and intracerebroventricular (ICV) OT, and an OXTR-antagonist on tasks that address social perception social reward in rhesus monkeys. The tasks used are designed to mirror those used in studies of IN-OT in humans, and address some ofthe same social skills known to be impaired in autism, e.g., salience of social stimuli, social reward, recognition of familiar faces, and emotion categorization. Additionally, monkeys will be shown complex videos of familiar and unfamiliar monkeys engaged in social interactions during eye-tracking to determine how IN-OT affects the convergence of social attention. This project will provide seminal data on how OT affects social perception and social reward and contribute to it pharmacotherapeutic development."

"9295090","PROJECT SUMMARY    The Affordable Care Act (ACA) transitioned the United States away from a voluntary health insurance system  to a universal participation scheme primarily through the use of an individual mandate, which requires all  Americans to obtain some form of health insurance coverage or face a penalty. By mandating a more inclusive  system, the individual mandate is able to raise social welfare through lowering the overall cost of accessing  healthcare services. On the other hand, an involuntary insurance scheme can compromise the economic  security of households, as the lack of complementary policies within the ACA forces some households to  finance a significant part of their health insurance premiums. This negative income transfer from the ACA can  constrain household budgets to the point where they curtail utilization of necessities, which can lead to the  adoption of adverse health behaviors that can cause negative health outcomes. Moreover, as minority  households are most likely to be living in or near poverty, they are disproportionally affected more than other  groups. This is a particularly troubling result, as the ACA?s individual mandate raises social welfare at the  expense of individual welfare without a clear mechanism to compensate for this loss.    One way to address this issue is for households to seek transfer payments from the government that will help  limit their losses to health and medical related debts. Governments are ideal to engage with, as they issue one-­ way transfers that are not required to pay back. In general, households can solicit transfers from the  government using the tax system (i.e., claiming medical deductions) or bankruptcy to reschedule or discharge  medical debts. Such financial tools have the potential of not only mitigating welfare losses from negative  income transfers, but also allow for reinvestment into a household?s health and wellbeing. The research  contained within this proposal investigates two main aims. The first research aim investigates the impact of  income transfers generated by the ACA on household financial decision-­making. The main analysis in this aim  utilizes difference-­in-­difference models to examine the impacts of both positive and negative income transfers  on a household?s propensity to itemize deductions or declare bankruptcy. The second aim examines the  impact of financial decision-­making on health outcomes. Logistic regression and multinomial regression are  both utilized to examine how the morbidity of disease and appropriate levels of utilization are impacted by  itemization and bankruptcy decisions. "
"9439278","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The global burden of breast cancer is on the rise making it the malignancy with the highest incidence among women worldwide. Yet, much of the international variation of breast cancer incidence cannot be explained with known or suspected risk factors. Attention has shifted to earlier time periods of a women's life recognizing the specil susceptibility of the prepubertal mammary gland tissue to environmental influences. The considerable time lag between events prior to or at puberty and diagnosis of breast cancer spanning several decades have made prospective studies difficult to accomplish. Early onset of mammary gland development and high breast density have been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer and can serve as early putative markers of breast cancer risk. A high proportion of radiographically dense area of the breast is one of the strongest known risk factor for breast cancer and may be established at the time of breast development at puberty. We propose to use an existing cohort of about 515 prepubertal Chilean girls born in 2002 to address the relation between putative early markers of breast cancer risk, specifically onset of mammary gland development (Tanner stage 2) and volume of dense breast tissue measured by DXA at Tanner stage 4 and a number of antecedents: endocrine-disrupting chemicals, specifically bisphenol A and phthalates; frequent consumption of high fat dairy products and red meat; blood levels of inflammatory markers, specifically interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor, and C-reactive protein; global DNA methylation, promoter methylation pattern, and methylation of the ER gene."
"9479339","Summary Breast cancer is the second most common and the major cause of cancer-related death of women in the USA. The last decade has witnessed major advancement of therapeutic drugs and tools, while noninvasive diagnostic imaging tools to measure interventions received much less attention. Currently, the mainstay of noninvasive imaging in breast cancer relies primarily on anatomic imaging. Metabolic imaging using FDG PET is a successful diagnostic tool in several types of cancer, but not in the setting of breast cancer. The last decade has also witnessed the revival of interest in the role of mitochondria in tumor invasiveness, and as regulators of cytotoxicity of first-line chemotherapy agents. Yet, current tools for noninvasive investigations and diagnostics of the mitochondrial function in cancer patients are limited to SPECT imaging agents. Our recent preclinical studies provided compelling evidence for the capacity of the PET imaging voltage sensor 18F- fluorobenzyltriphenylphosphonium (FBnTP), developed by the PI laboratory, to potentially improve management of breast cancer. This includes: (1) improved early detection of early-stage, small, vascularized breast lesion with better functional and spatial resolution compared to FDG PET and SPECT imaging; (2) Accurate 3D mapping of tumor proliferation, an important prognostic factor in the clinical setting; and (3) very early molecular-level detection of treatment response, directly at the core mechanism of cytotoxicity of first-line chemotherapy agents. The technology supporting these utilities is based on our studies which demonstrate that cellular uptake of FBnTP is directly proportional to the mitochondrial membrane potential (??m) of a cell. ??m is the most comprehensive physiological endpoint of the organelle bioenergetics. ??m is a unique target that enables attaining the above goals. ??m is significantly greater in certain types of malignant cells, including those of breast origin, compared to normal cells, resulting in a preferential accumulation of FBnTP in tumor mass, compared to healthy parenchyma. ??m increases in highly proliferating breast cancer cells, whereas collapse of ??m coincides with the initiation of the irreversible phase of the apoptotic cell death as induced by many first-line chemotherapy agents in the breast cancer setting. The goal of this STTR Phase 1 study is to establish proof of concept in patient samples under the approved IRB that FBnTP is an effective imaging technology to detect breast lesions in women; a prerequisite for future feasibility studies of FBnTP as a surrogate marker of breast tumor invasiveness and response to therapeutic interventions. To improve commercial competitiveness, FBnTP imaging will be carried out using breast- dedicated positron emission mammogram (PEM), a less costly technology, compared to PET, CT and MRI and of better spatial resolution than PET."

The current proposal includes several new features designed to enrich and enhance the existing program including new mentors, thrice yearly scientific social combined with the pediatric GI training program and a two year Clinical Scientist Training Program for MD trainees."
"9328901","Project Summary The mouse mammary gland provides a robust mammalian system for investigating how epithelial behavior impacts tumorigenesis. The mammary epithelium is composed of an inner layer of milk-producing luminal cells and an outer layer of contractile myoepithelial cells. Several mammalian epithelial tissues rely on oriented cell divisions to maintain proper structure and function, however it remains unclear whether this mechanism plays the same important role in the mammary gland. I hypothesize that misoriented cell divisions in the luminal layer drive cell escape from the epithelium and promote breast cancer initiation. To test this hypothesis, I will first force luminal cells to divide out of the epithelial plane by manipulating spindle orientation mechanisms both in vivo and in 3D organoid culture. I will determine whether this intervention causes luminal filling through apically-oriented cell escape, invasive behaviors through basally-oriented escape, hyperproliferation and/or apoptosis. In my second approach, I will employ human and mouse breast cancer models to both analyze spindle orientation and determine whether misoriented divisions are driven by oncogenic activation. These studies could ultimately reveal important therapeutic targets for preventing, detecting and treating invasive breast cancers."
"9393710","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Continued support is requested for interdisciplinary training in the vision sciences at the University of California, Davis. Training is provided by 45 vision scientists (31 preceptors and 14 associate preceptors) across 14 departments that will provide a strong foundation in one or more basic sciences. The goal of the training program is to produce vision scientists who will be capable of establishing independent research programs that will address significant problems in vision science. It will operate under the auspices of existing graduate programs at UC Davis as they offer the broad flexibility needed to achieve our training objectives. Among our 300 pre- and postdoctoral vision science trainees in the past ten years (38 of whom were partially supported by this T32), 90% are active in research through continuing training or in career positions. Among those who have completed all training, 82% are active in research and/or teaching positions at some 71 different colleges, university basic science departments and schools of medicine or veterinary medicine. The training program requests support for 4 predoctoral students (for two years each; 8 slots) and 1 postdoctoral trainee (for one year) to be selected by an Advisory Committee. Internal support mechanisms and extramural grants will be used for the other years of training. The trainees will participate i one or more of five overlapping areas in which our preceptors are clustered: (1) molecular & cellular biology, retinal electrophysiology, and genetics, (2) anterior segment anatomy and physiology, (3) molecular and cellular retinal imaging, (4) systems visual neuroscience, and (5) functional imaging, computational modeling and perception. Each of the 31 preceptors has an active program of vision science research, a strong commitment to training, and extramural funding. Program resources are augmented by a strong institutional commitment, the Center for Visual Sciences and an NEI Core grant. The training program draws on the rigorous research training of the admitting programs, but also requires a one-year course that covers the broader vision sciences and clinical vision science. Graduate trainees will be supported only after their first year of graduate training and will thus be a highly selective group that has completed much of their basic science curriculum. All trainees will participate in an active colloquium series in he vision sciences, Center for Visual Sciences symposia, journal clubs and training in the ethical conduct of research. All trainees will be engaged in vision science research that will be presented at national meetings and submitted to peer-reviewed journals."
"9485694","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Newborn screening (NBS) is an essential public health program in all 50 states. The falling cost of whole genome/ exome sequencing provides an opportunity to ask whether whole genome analysis (WGA) might serve as a method of cost-effective newborn screening for any and every condition. We will address certain critical questions raised by the application of this technology to NBS. We will use Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) as a cost-effective method of WGA in 1620 newborn blood spots that are linked to the clinical data of the newborns. We will then test WES as a NBS Tool for metabolic and immunological disorders. These data will be used to 1) compare the sensitivity and specificity of mutation data with biochemical testing, 2) identify gene variants that predict which  children with certain metabolic disorders are at greater risk for metabolic decompensation, 3) identify mutations in genes responsible for those primary immunodeficiencies that are not detected by the current T-Cell receptor excision circle assay used for severe combined immunodeficiency screening, and 4) scan 9 genes for variants that are clinically important for drug metabolism and would be typical secondary findings if WES were to be used as a NBS method. We will also develop a participant protection framework for conducting WGA during the neonatal period, determine the views, perspectives, and value preferences of key stakeholders about using WGA for NBS, collaborate with the UC Hastings Consortium on Law, Science and Health Policy, to identify the legal and constitutional issues for using WGA, and for incorporating  PGx into NBS programs, and develop and disseminate policy recommendations for expanded NBS programs based on WGA."

"9333210","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal for this renewal application is to a) elucidate oncogenic Kras (Kras*)-regulated metabolic pathways mediating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumor maintenance, b) define collateral metabolic dependencies, and c) establish how interventions targeting these processes influence tumor immunity, in order to guide the design of clinical trials with existing drugs and to identify new therapeutic points of attack. Our P01 program comprises 3 highly interdependent and collaborative projects and 4 essential cores with the goals of conquering PDAC through targeting metabolic vulnerabilities in conjunction with immunotherapy. Project 1 has demonstrated that Kras* extinction in PDAC leads to pronounced tumor regression that involves critical functions of Kras* in metabolic reprogramming. We have also identified Kras*-extinction resistant cells (KRCs), which show dramatic adaptive metabolic changes (in OXPHOS and autophagy) allowing survival upon Kras* inactivation. These studies thereby provide benchmarks for successfully targeting Kras* in vivo and predicting resistance mechanisms that may be encountered in the clinic. Thus, the goal of Project 1 is to kill the bulk Kras*-dependent tumor cells through identification of metabolic targets essential for Kras*-mediated PDAC maintenance and to define methods to eliminate KRC through inhibiting autophagy and OXPHOS survival mechanisms. Project 2 has discovered that PDAC is dependent on lysosome-dependent nutrient scavenging pathways for metabolic homeostasis and tumor growth, and has identified a transcriptional program that activates these processes. The goal of Project 2 is to decipher how lysosomal scavenging supports PDAC growth and how cancer cells can escape their dependence on these processes, thereby informing improved therapeutic approaches. Project 2 will identify the metabolic outputs of lysosomal mediated recycling pathways, establish which of these outputs play roles in PDAC growth, and explore metabolic escape pathways in order to identify novel therapeutic combinations synergizing with lysosomal inhibition. Project 3 has defined profound alterations in the tumor microenvironment, including a prominent CD8 T cell infiltration following Kras* extinction in PDAC. Project 3 will define the immune profiles throughout the genesis, regression and recurrence of PDAC and will determine the causal role of CD8 and CD4 cells in PDAC regression, as well as explore new opportunities to test the efficacy of checkpoint blockade therapy and assess the associated adaptive mechanisms underlying immune suppression. Furthermore, Project 3 will determine the direct impact of metabolically targeted therapy on tumor immunity and define effective methods to combine such therapies with immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Highly innovative cores for Pathology, Preclinical Therapeutics, Computation, and an Administrative Core will enable these Projects."
"9272962","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malawi, a Sub-Saharan African country of 15 million with HIV prevalence of 11%, has a ten year history of creative, simplified HIV programming. While a wealth of programmatic data exists and HIV research in treatment and prevention is ongoing, the next stages of research are clearly related to implementation science. How can the HIV programs be optimized to have the greatest impact on the epidemic? With finite resources, what program components should be prioritized to maximize uptake and retention along the continuum of care? To answer these questions, Malawi needs to build its foundation in implementation science as few, if any Malawian investigators are formally trained in implementation science methodology. Our Malawi HIV Implementation Research Training Program (M-HIRST) builds on 15 years of UNC- supported Fogarty-sponsored training activities that have developed a small pool of Malawian researchers with sustainable research leadership. Now, we focus on enhancing the implementation science research skills of 12 junior faculty and 150 junior investigators while also expanding the pool of qualified researchers through post-graduate training (8 investigators). Our goal is to place these talented researchers into research programs at the University of Malawi, College of Medicine (COM), the only medical school in the country. Our program is designed to maximize cost-effectiveness by utilizing existing programs and conducting the majority of activities in Malawi or South Africa. Our faculty members live in or regularly travel to Malawi, thereby reducing travel costs to the program. Our planned training program includes the following i) a Implementation scientific priorities generation workshop with key stakeholders in year 1,3, and 5 ii) provision of annual 1-2 week short courses in implementation science, clinical trial design, epidemiological research, grant- writing, iii) mentorship for trainee research and career development by UNC and COM faculty, iv) 4-6 months implementation science internships (2 annually) and v) competitive mentored research small grants programs (3-5 grants per year). Over the grant period, we expect 12 junior faculty to engage in the M-HIRST program, 15 to benefit from small grants, and 150 to participate in short courses (~30/year). To expand the pool of implementation scientists, we will train 2 PhD candidates in implementation science through our collaboration with the University of Witwatersrand, and 6 MPH/MSc candidates through the existing Malawi COM MPH course. Importantly, we will strengthen the COM Research Support Center by establishing an Implementation Science Unit within the Center, expanding a Mentor the Mentors program, and providing grants management training. The implementation Science unit will provide a framework for standardized research instruction as the post-graduate training programs expand and support the Faculty Research Track. By the end of the award, we expect to have independently funded Malawian investigators capable of leading the Malawi HIV treatment and prevention implementation science agenda."
"9275034","public health. If the application is funded, this description, as is, will become public information. Therefore,  do not include proprietary/confidential information. DO NOT EXCEED THE SPACE PROVIDED.  We previously demonstrated that diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) successfully detects axon and myelin injury  through decreased axial diffusivity (&#955;&#9553;, parallel to the white-matter tract) and increased radial diffusivity (&#955;&#61534;,  perpendicular to the white-matter tract) in animal models of central nervous system (CNS) diseases and  injuries. During the initial Program Project funding period, we identified confounding factors, such as  inflammation and tissue loss, causing misinterpretation of DTI-detected axonal pathologies. Thus, we  developed a novel diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI) to detect, differentiate, and quantify the extent of  inflammation, and axon/myelin injury (Wang et al. 2011).  In this PPG renewal, in vivo DBSI will be used to document the evolution of inflammation, axonal injury, and  demyelination in optic nerve and spinal cord white-matter tracts in murine EAE, correlating with neurological  impairment. DBSI-determined pathologies will be correlated with immunohistochemistry (IHC) during the  course of EAE to validate DBSI injury markers. Functional impairment will be correlated with individual  and/or combinations of axonal pathologies determined by DBSI and IHC to ascertain which best  corresponds to clinical impairments.  To explore the use of DBSI as an endpoint for clinical trials, the effect of FTY720 treatment on functional  impairment in EAE will be correlated with DBSI-determined axonal pathologies in optic nerve and spinal cord  tracts and confirmed by IHC. In addition, we will use both DBSI and the widely-reported manganese  enhanced MRI to concomitantly assess the anterograde axonal transport rate of optic nerve in control vs.  EAE mice to determine the relationship between axonal transport dysfunction and DBSI-determined axonal  pathologies. This would allow an opportunity to delineate whether inflammation or axonal injury of optic  nerve underlies functional deficits and to define the role of axonal transport in optic neuritis. If axonal  transport defects occur early and persist (as suggested by our preliminary data), this may be a potential  therapeutic target."
"9267356","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a request for renewal of a T32 training program from the Department of Pediatrics at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. Our long term objective is to support the career development of pediatric physician-scientists who will become the future leaders in child health research in vulnerable populations. Such populations include children who are at risk for adverse health outcomes due to intrinsic biologic differences, elevated burdens of disease, or social characteristics such as financial limitations, place of residence, and inability to communicate effectively. The specific aims of this proposal are to identify qualified trainees at the end of residency or early in fellowship training and to provide them with an interdisciplinary research experience in the laboratory of a qualified mentor with adequate resources and space and ready access to unique populations of vulnerable children. To ensure long term success, this experience will be integrated with the Vanderbilt Master of Science in Clinical Investigation and Master of Public Health programs, an applied skills practicum in conducting research in vulnerable populations, and frequent interactions among trainees from multiple disciplines to foster trainees' career development. Highlights since the program was funded in May 2009 include the training of 15 young physician-scientists from neonatology, pediatric infectious diseases, pediatric hematology/oncology, developmental pediatrics, general pediatrics, pediatric cardiology, and pediatric endocrinology. Nine fellows have completed the program, 100% entered into additional research training or academic careers at the end of training. After two fellows left academics for personal reasons during the two years following training, the program modified selection criteria and to date 100% of the more recent graduating fellows remain in academics. The trainees have published 63 manuscripts (4.2 per trainee) and the program's diversity efforts have been quite successful (27% of the trainees came from underrepresented groups). In view of the continued strong applicant pool and the strengths of the program, we propose continued support for three trainees in PGY-5 and three in PGY-6. The program director will utilize an Advisory committee composed of national experts within and external to Vanderbilt University to obtain on-going advice with respect to candidate and mentor selection, scholarly progress of selected candidates and overall success. The proposal is broadly focused within four core disciplines that represent unique and substantial research strengths of Vanderbilt University and that define critical areas of need for new knowledge in child health research on particularly vulnerable populations and include Infectious Diseases/Epidemiology, Neurodevelopment, Health Disparities, and Pharmacoepidemiology/Pharmacogenomics. Continuation of this program will permit the development of a cadre of highly-qualified pediatric physician-scientists with the skills, knowledge and dedication to solve some of the most important health care issues currently facing our nation's children."
"9487755","The purpose of this agreement is to provide funding for scientific and technical support as well as quality assurance of three large audiometric examination surveys funded by NIDCD. These health surveys are: (i) The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), (ii) Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility Study?Reykjavik Study (AGES?RS), and (iii) the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study ? Kindergarten Class of 2010/2011 (ECLS?K:2010/2011). The Audiometry Components of all three health examination surveys were previously developed by NIDCD in collaboration with NIOSH and other consultants. NIOSH collaborated on the design of the experimental protocol and provided the equipment specifications, oversight of maintenance and calibration, technician training and oversight, operations manual development, and quality assurance for the NHANES. As well, NIOSH provided similar support to AGES and ECLS?K:2010/2011, including setting-up  training sessions and observing/monitoring technical competence in obtaining audiometric measurements, technical assistance as needed, and limited quality assurance. The NHANES scientific goals are to establish a statistically accurate, demographically representative baseline on the general health (including Hearing Health) of the U.S. population. NHANES is now a continuous survey and while general health issues are always under investigation such as height, weight, and blood pressure, there are also elements that track individual health outcomes that move in and out of the NHANES as it cycles. NHANES consists of two major components: the household interview and the physical examination in the NHANES Mobile Examination Centers (MECs) that are set up in various areas around the country. The data from the NHANES elements are collected, weighted, and made available to the government and the public as a database on which analysis may be performed. Recently, the data have been released every two years with collaborating agencies receiving the data six months prior to the public release of the data sets. The AGES?RS scientific goals are: 1) to identify genetic and new risk factors for selected diseases including atherosclerosis, cognitive impairment, dementia, stroke, hearing loss, visual impairment, sarcopenia, osteoporosis, and obesity, 2) to characterize phenotypes for these diseases and conditions, and 3) to identify contributory molecular markers associated with these conditions. The proposed ECLS:K-2011 audiometry protocol for the third-grade data collection includes four components: pre-test questions, otoscopy, wideband reflectometry with tympanometry, and pure tone audiometry:  (1) Pre-Test Questions:  Children will be asked a series of short questions regarding conditions which could affect the test results (cold or earaches, noise exposure within past 24 hours, presence of pe tubes, and whether one ear is better than the other); (2) Otoscopy:  Children will receive a brief visual examination of the ear, primarily to assure a clear sound path.  In addition, the technicians will note the presence of excessive cerumen or any other gross abnormality which could affect interpretation of audiometric findings. The otoscopic exam will not be diagnostic; it will simply be observational; (3) Wideband Reflectometry, including Tympanometry:  An automated wideband reflectometric/tympanometric evaluation of the middle ear will be conducted bilaterally. Analysis and interpretation of the results will be done remotely; (4) Pure Tone Audiometry:  Pure tone air conduction thresholds will be obtained bilaterally at 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hz insofar as time and the child?s attention permits. A retest threshold will be obtained in both ears at 2000 Hz as a measure of test reliability. The thresholds will be obtained manually using a modified Hughson-Westlake technique. The first test ear will be alternated to avoid learning effect bias in the thresholds. Frequencies will be tested in a specified order to obtain the more important frequency data first in case time or the child?s attention runs out before all frequencies are completed. All three health surveys share similar hearing exam components, developed collaboratively by NIDCD, NIOSH, NCHS, WESTAT, the Icelandic Heart Association Research Institute, and the Department of Educations, National Center for Education Statistics. The hearing component consists of: 1) a set of questionnaires relating to hearing, noise exposure, and other factors relating to hearing, and 2) audiometric examinations consisting of otoscopy, acoustic immittance (bilateral tympanometry or wide-band reflectometry and screening for ipsilateral acoustic reflexes at 1000 and 2000 Hz), and pure-tone, air-conduction audiometry to determine the hearing thresholds in each ear at several frequencies, such as 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hz.  A repeat threshold test is obtained at 1000 Hz or 2000 Hz as a measure of test reliability. When significant inter-ear differences are found, then retests may be performed using insert earphones to maximize the inter-aural attenuation rather than using a noise masker of the non-test ear to obtain what is referred to as masked threshold in the in the test ear to avoid recording of a ?shadow audiogram? from the better non-test ear."
"9331060","Abstract  Although 71% of American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) live in urban areas, most research on Native health has been conducted in rural and reservation communities. The result is a troubling dearth of knowledge on the overall AI/AN population, which experiences some of the harshest health disparities of any US racial or ethnic group. This gap in our understanding is particularly concerning in the case of Native elders, meaning those aged 65 and older. Findings over the past two decades show that AI/ANs of all ages are at elevated risk of obesity, smoking, substance abuse, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and traumatic injury.3-8 Limited data also suggest that the risk for several of these behaviors and conditions ? notably alcohol abuse, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and traumatic injury ? is even higher among urban Natives. Yet we lack the knowledge base necessary for a nuanced understanding of the risk profiles and healthcare needs of urban Native elders, who likely encounter a ?risk landscape? that differs substantially from the one traversed by their rural counterparts. To stimulate research that will address this gap in knowledge and inform the allocation of healthcare resources for programs responsive to the needs of urban Native elders, we propose a conference series: Annual Summit on Urban Native Elder Health and Healthcare. The present application seeks support for the first conference in this series, a two-day event that will be held in Seattle in July 2017, immediately after the well-established National Urban Indian Health Conference in the same city. Summit sessions will include presentations on ongoing and completed research; capacity-building sessions that offer training on research administration and participation in multi-site projects; a brainstorming session to develop a collective agenda for research on the health of urban Native elders; and a working meeting to establish a collaborative research network among conference participants."
"9386624","Coxiella burnetii is the intracellular bacterial agent of human Q fever, a debilitating flu-like illness that can also present as severe chronic endocarditis. C. burnetii is spread by contaminated aerosols and targets alveolar phagocytes in vivo, where the pathogen actively regulates vesicular trafficking to establish a phagolysosome-like parasitophorous vacuole (PV) in which to replicate. Although PV biogenesis is critical for infection, the macrophage innate immune response to infection is not fully understood. The current proposal uses two novel infection models, human lung tissue and alveolar macrophages, to test the hypothesis that C. burnetii specifically alters human alveolar macrophage physiology to prevent inflammasome activity and avoid the innate immune response. These models will provide human-specific information not obtainable using current animal models. Aim 1 will characterize C. burnetii infection of lung cells, definitively proving the cell type targeted during human infection. Aim 2 will define macrophage inflammasome activation in response to avirulent C. burnetii and identify mechanisms by which virulent organisms avoid detection. Collectively, these studies will provide enhanced modeling of the C. burnetii infectious process and the human innate immune response to pulmonary pathogens."
"9384080","What spatial structure and mechanics develops in biofilm infections, and how such spatial structure and mechanics impact the persistence and virulence of biofilm infections, is not known. The long-term goal is to find diagnostic and treatment approaches that address the structure and mechanics of multicellular, three- dimensional biofilm infections within the host. The objective of this proposal is to determine the mechanics and structure of biofilm infections of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa in chronic wounds, and how these physical properties impact disease course. The central hypothesis is that spatial structure and mechanics are the major physical factors controlling virulence, antibiotic resistance, and immune evasion in biofilm infections. The rationale underlying this proposal is that completion will identify key physical targets for preventing, disrupting, or ameliorating biofilm infections for an important biofilm-forming pathogen. The proposed work will also develop a widely-applicable platform for assessing the state and impact of biofilm structure and mechanics for other infecting organisms. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Determine the spatial structure and mechanics of in vivo biofilm infections; 2) Determine how spatial arrangements differentiate into distinct microenvironments; 3) Determine the role of spatial structure and mechanics in biofilm-neutrophil interactions. We will pursue these aims using an innovative combination of analytical and manipulative techniques from both biological and physical sciences. These include both recently-developed techniques specific to biofilm studies, and more-established techniques that have been applied very little to the study of biofilm materials. The proposed research is significant, because it will determine which structural and mechanical characteristics should be therapeutic targets. It is also significant because it will develop a platform that can be extended to study other pathogens (or commensals) and synergies to open new avenues for biofilm therapies. This work will develop foundational resources that will be used by other researchers, for P. aeruginosa and other organisms. The proximate expected outcome of this work an understanding of which biofilm structural and mechanical characteristics contribute to clinical impact. The results will have an important positive impact immediately because they will establish better understanding of biofilm infection, virulence, and resistance to antibiotics and the immune system for an important pathogens, and long-term because they lay the groundwork to develop a suite of techniques for better treatment of biofilm infections."
"9446259","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic inflammation of the esophagus due to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) contributes to the development of Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma, a lethal tumor whose incidence has been rising at an alarming rate. Modern medical therapy of GERD is directed almost exclusively at decreasing gastric acid production with medications such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). In GERD patients taking PPIs, weakly acidic gastric juice frequently refluxes into the esophagus. Perhaps this is why PPIs do not completely eliminate GERD symptoms in up to 40% of patients, and why the frequency of esophageal adenocarcinoma continues to rise despite the widespread use of PPIs. New medical treatments are needed to improve GERD symptom control, and to prevent the development of Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma.  In a rat model of reflux esophagitis in which an esophago-duodenostomy is created to induce reflux, we recently studied the early histological events in the development of reflux esophagitis, and found a sequence suggesting that this esophagitis develops through a cytokine-mediated injury rather than through an acid burn. Based on these experiments, we proposed a new concept for the development of reflux esophagitis in which the reflux of gastric juice stimulates esophageal squamous epithelial cells to secrete cytokines that induce proliferative changes and attract inflammatory cells, and it is those inflammatory changes, not the caustic effects of acid, that ultimately damage the esophageal mucosa.  Hypoxia, a common feature of chronically inflamed tissues, contributes to inflammation through the regulation of HIFs, a family of transcription factors that allow cells to respond to hypoxic stress. Recently, in a mouse model of colitis caused by a genetically-engineered increase in HIF-2? signaling in colonic epithelial cells, colitis was shown to develop in a pattern virtually identical to that which we observed in our rat model of reflux esophagitis. In addition, we have preliminary data demonstrating that exposure to a weakly acidic bile salt solution activates HIF-2? signaling in esophageal epithelial cells. Therefore, we hypothesize that esophageal secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and esophageal epithelial cell proliferation result from reflux-induced activation of HIF-2?. The aims of this study are (1) to elucidate the mechanisms whereby acid and bile salts activate HIF-2?, (2) to determine the role of HIF-2? in acid and bile salt-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and epithelial cell proliferation in esophageal squamous cells in vitro, and (3) to elaborate the early histological events in the pathogenesis of reflux esophagitis in the esophagus of patients with GERD, and to correlate those events with esophageal expression of HIF-2? and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and with changes in esophageal proliferation."
"9484073","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall aim of this grant is to elucidate the novel linkage between copper transport protein Antioxidant1 (Atox1) and NADPH oxidase involved in inflammatory angiogenesis. Ischemic disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in worldwide. Neovascularization is an important repair process in response to ischemia, which depends on angiogenesis, inflammation and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Copper (Cu), an essential micronutrient, is involved in physiological repair processes such as wound healing and angiogenesis as well as in various pathophysiologies including tumor growth, atherosclerosis and inflammatory diseases. Since excess Cu is toxic, bioavailability of intracellular Cu is tightly controlled by Cu transport proteins such as Cu chaperone Atox1. Our laboratories provided the first evidence that Atox1 functions as a Cu-dependent transcription factor to regulate Cu-induced cell growth. Furthermore, we are one of the first to demonstrate that ROS derived from NADPH oxidase (Nox) play an important role in angiogenic signaling in endothelial cells (ECs) as well as postnatal angiogenesis in response to ischemic injury. However, the role of Cu transport proteins in inflammatory angiogenesis and its linkage with Nox are entirely unknown. Our preliminary data suggest that Atox1 deficient mice have impaired angiogenesis and inflammatory cell recruitment due to decrease in endothelial ROS production in ischemic tissues. Bone marrow (BM) reconstitution indicates that Atox1 in ECs, but not BM cells, is required for post-ischemic revascularization. Based on new preliminary data, we hypothesize that Atox1 functions as a novel regulator for Nox by transcriptional regulation of p47phox as well as activating Rac1; both are critical cytosolic components of Nox, in a Cu-dependent manner. This in turn promotes ROS-dependent signaling linked to inflammatory and angiogenic responses in ECs, which contributes to neovascularization in response to ischemic injury. Aim1 will focus on establishing a role of Atox1 in regulating NADPH oxidase and ROS-dependent inflammatory and angiogenic signaling and function in ECs in a Cu-dependent manner. Aim 2 will focus on identifying molecular mechanisms of how Atox1 is involved in activation of NADPH oxidase through transcriptional regulation of p47phox and activating Rac1 via binding to a Rac1-binding scaffold protein IQGAP1 in ECs in a Cu-dependent manner. Aim 3 will focus on determining the functional role of Atox1 in neovascularization in vivo by regulating ROS production, angiogenesis and inflammatory cell recruitment in injured tissues in a Cu-dependent manner using hindlimb ischemia model with Atox1-/- mice. Bone marrow transplantation, in vivo intravital microscopy and bioluminescence imaging, highly innovative Cu imaging analysis in vitro and in vivo will be performed. Our study will provide novel insight into Cu transport protein and their regulators as potential therapeutic targets for treatment of angiogenesis- and inflammation-dependent ischemic cardiovascular diseases."
"9275435","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Malignant phenotypes are driven by a group of coordinated proteins and targeting a cluster of functionally interdependent molecules should be more effective for therapeutic intervention. This is especially true for Ras- dependent cancers, as the Ras oncoprotein is non-druggable and targeting its interaction with key partner proteins may be essential for therapeutic development. K-Ras is mutated in up to 50% of colon cancers, and has been implicated in malignant development and progression. There is thus an urgent need to develop targeted therapies for K-Ras mutated (MT-K-Ras) colon cancer. This proposal will test the hypothesis that a p38g-activated ternary complex with MT-K-Ras and heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a novel therapeutic target for K-Ras dependent colon cancer. This hypothesis is supported by our preliminary studies showing that p38g mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), an established Ras effector, binds Hsp90, a chaperone, and MT-K-Ras, but not wild-type (WT) K-Ras, in colon cancer cells. Moreover, p38g phosphorylates Hsp90, and pharmacological inhibitors of p38g or Hsp90 disrupt the ternary complex, decrease MT-K-Ras levels of protein expression, and selectively inhibit K-Ras dependent growth in vitro and/or in vivo. Together, these results indicate that the p38g activated ternary complex with Hsp90 and MT-K-Ras is a potential therapeutic target for K-Ras dependent colon cancer. The following specific aims will test this hypothesis: 1) To demonstrate that p38g and Hsp90 form a ternary protein complex that protects MT-K-Ras from proteasome- dependent degradation; 2) To demonstrate if p38g activates Hsp90 by inducing its phosphorylation at S595 and whether this event is central to the formation of the MT-K-Ras/p38g/Hsp90 complex; and 3) To demonstrate the therapeutic potential and clinical significance of the p38g/Hsp90/K-Ras complex in colon cancer. These studies will demonstrate that the p38g-activated ternary-complex is a novel therapeutic target for MT-K-Ras colon cancer. Disruption of this complex with pharmacological inhibitors of p38g and Hsp90 is a highly promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of K-Ras dependent colon cancer. Since colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States, discovery of novel targeted therapeutics for K-Ras dependent colon cancer will directly contribute to veteran's health care."
"9350715","ABSTRACT - Overall The overall goal of the Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity Center in the Cancer Systems Biol- ogy Consortium (M2CH-CSBC Center) is to improve management of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) by developing systems level strategies to prevent the emergence of cancer subpopulations that are resistant to treatment. We postulate that heterogeneity arising from epigenomic instability intrinsic to cancer cells and di- verse signals from extrinsic microenvironments in which cancer cells reside are root causes of resistance. We will learn how intrinsic and extrinsic factors influence differentiation state, proliferation and therapeutic re- sponse in TNBC through experimental manipulation and computational modeling of cancer cell lines, 3D engi- neered multicellular systems, xenografts and clinical specimens. We will deploy single cell `omic and imaging technologies that allow quantitative assessment of molecular, cellular, and structural heterogeneity. We will interpret these data using computational models that define control networks and structures in heterogeneous systems as well as transitions between states of therapeutic resistance and sensitivity. This will be accom- plished in three related Projects and three Cores. Project 1 will focus on measuring and managing resistance- associated heterogeneity intrinsic to cancer cells. Project 2 will focus on identifying resistance-associated sig- nals from the microenvironment and on mitigating effects from these signals on therapeutic response. Project 3 will apply spatial systems biology approaches to TNBC specimens and multicell type models thereof to dis- cover molecular control networks that influence how cell intrinsic plasticity and microenvironment signaling al- ter therapeutic responses in complex tissues. All three Projects will include analysis of 5 core cell lines (HCC1143, HCC1599, MDA-MB-468, SUM149PT, and HCC1806), 5 patient derived cultures, and 6 FDA ap- proved, pathway-targeted drugs (afatinib, ruxolotinib, trametinib, BYL719, cabozantinib, and everolimus). The computational network discovery, data integration, spatial systems analysis and modeling approaches are the same in all Projects and serve to integrate the work of the overall M2CH-CSBC Center. Multiple integrative computational strategies are proposed to identify candidate heterogeneity control networks. These include analysis of existing genomic, epigenomic, pharmacologic response, and metabolomic characteristics of prima- ry tumors and models thereof. An Imaging Management and Analysis Core will provide infrastructure and image analytics that will enable efficient image data management, quantitative analysis of image features, and visualization of images and metadata generated using multiscale light and electron microscopy. An Outreach Core will make educational materials, experimental and computational tools and data available to the CSB Consortium, to the CSBC/PS-ON Coordinating Center and to the broader scientific community. An Administrative Core serves as the organization, integration, and evaluation hub of the M2CH-CSBC Center."
"9378314","Antimicrobial peptides have diverse functions, serving not only to directly attack pathogens, but also as chemotactic agents and as an alarm system that activates host immune cells. Human beta defensin-3 (hBD3) is an important antimicrobial peptide produced at mucosal surfaces and which can cause activation of monocytes and other antigen-presenting cells. New preliminary data provide evidence that hBD3 is found in platelets and can activate platelets through molecular pathways that are currently undefined. Platelets patrol the circulatory system for vascular injury and are intimately involved in blood clotting processes. Moreover, these cells provide rapid responses to injury and when activated, release stored contents that have potent effects on the immune system. The proposed studies will investigate platelet activation by hBD3, including the molecular pathways involved (Aim 1), the expression of hBD3 in platelet granules and microparticles (Aim 2) and the potential crosstalk between platelets and monocytes that may be orchestrated by this antimicrobial peptide (Aim 3). The expression and activity of hBD3 that will be defined in platelets by these proposed studies may uncover a new paradigm at the intersection of platelets and host immunity."
"9250208","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The oxytocin (OT) system is arguably the most viable target for pharmacologically enhancing social cognition in psychiatric disorders with compromised social cognition, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Central OT enhances key aspects of social behavior in animals, and intranasal (IN) OT modulates social cognition in humans. The mechanisms by which OT affects social cognition are not understood. We will launch a coordinated, interdisciplinary research program involving an outstanding team of investigators to test the hypothesis that OT enhances social cognition by increasing the salience and reinforcing value of social stimuli by modulating activity and functional connectivity of the amygdala and brain regions involved in reward. Project scientists will use cutting edge techniques to assess functional connectivity between brain regions during social interactions, responses of individual neurons in the amygdala to social stimuli, or social cognition in animals and humans. Projects 1 and 2 will use in vivo electrophysiology to examine the impact of OT on the neural representation of social stimuli in rodents and rhesus macaques. Project 3 will use cognitive tests to examine the impact of OT on social perception and social attunement in the primate. Project 4 will use cognitive testing and fMRI to examine the impact of OT on social cognition and neural activity in healthy and autistic humans. A Neurochemistry Core will provide vital services for the research projects and develop new tools for characterizing OT receptor expression in the brain. An Administrative Core will coordinate all Center related activities (seminar series, organizing meetings), will provide statistical consultation and coordinate outreach and training activities of Center personnel by strengthening existing relationships and forging new relationships with numerous organizations in the Atlanta area. As a result, the Center will create vibrant collaborative research, training and outreach environment that will have a national impact on mental health research. The data collected by Center faculty will have important translational implications that will directly impact novel strategies for pharmacologically treating social deficits in psychiatric disorders."
"9267474","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite great advances in AIDS diagnosis and treatment, the continuing AIDS epidemic demands continuing efforts to understand all aspects of HIV replication and to develop new methods for its inhibition. In pursuit of these goals, we have sought to define the activities and interactions of the HIV-1 structural (Gag) proteins so as to design antivirals that interfere with these functions. The Gag proteins are attractive targets since they perform multiple roles during the life cycle. The proteins initially are synthesized as N-terminally myristoylated precursor (PrGag) proteins that employ their N-terminal matrix (MA) domains to target delivery to plasma membrane (PM) virus assembly sites. Evidence indicates that the HIV-1 MA preferentially binds the signaling phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate (PI[4,5]P2), and that virus membranes are enriched for lipid raft constituents such as cholesterol, sphingomyelin, and ceremide. MA also binds RNA, suggesting a model in which RNA binding protects MA from binding to inappropriate intracellular membranes prior to PrGag delivery to PI(4,5)P2-rich sites at the PM. In addition to its trafficking role, MA also has been shown to mediate the incorporation of the HIV-1 envelope (Env) glycoprotein complex into virus particles. The MA-Env interaction involves the long cytoplasmic tail (CT) of the transmembrane (TM; gp41) portion of Env, and residues at the distal ends (spokes) and interface regions (hubs) of MA trimers; but models for how MA mediates Env assembly into virions remain a matter of speculation. Using our previous studies and preliminary results as a foundation, we propose to dissect the mechanisms of MA-membrane/RNA and MA-Env binding, and to characterize methods for their inhibition. Our results will help clarify how the HIV assembly machinery operates; and will lead to the development of Gag-targeted antivirals, and an understanding of how they work. To achieve these ends, our aims are as follows: 1. Characterization of HIV-1 matrix-membrane/RNA binding and its inhibition. 2. Elucidation of HIV-1 matrix-envelope protein interactions."
"9292020","Modified Project Summary/Abstract Section Competence with algebra is the foundation for the mathematics that facilitates reasoned decision making in many aspects of day-to-day life, including medical treatment choices (Reyna et al. 2009), is demanded in high-paying technology and science fields (National Mathematics Advisory Panel 2008), and contributes to employability and wages in many blue collar occupations (Bynner 1997). Yet, only 39% of US high school graduates have the algebraic competencies needed for these endeavors. Improving the algebraic skills of US students will yield individual and wider social benefits, but this goal has been difficult to achieve. One impediment is our piecemeal understanding of algebraic learning and cognition that has resulted in both practical and theoretical costs. Practically, one student may have difficulty due to an undervaluation of the importance of mathematics, another may have poorly developed prerequisite skills, and a third may confuse current learning with prior learning (proactive inhibition). The reasons for algebraic deficits in these students are very different and consequently the interventions to address them would differ as well. No current theory exists that integrates cognitive and non-cognitive processes on algebra readiness and learning, an integration that is needed for the development of measures to better assess individual differences in algebraic learning. In this proposal we develop such a model and use it to organize a comprehensive and deep longitudinal study of individual and gender differences in readiness for algebra and the learning of specific, core algorithmic and spatial-related algebraic competencies. Carefully chosen measures of prerequisite skills, visuospatial memory and cognition, complex spatial ability, proactive interference, and inherent sensitivity to magnitude will be administered to 450 7th graders. Their attitudes about mathematics and their math anxiety, as well as their attentive behavior in mathematics and English (as a contrast) classrooms will be annually assessed in 7th to 9th grade. At the beginning and end of 9th grade, participants will be assessed using psychometric and cognitive measures of algebraic competence generally and competence with algorithmic and spatial-dependent aspects of algebra in particular. The breadth and depth of measures will enable testing of nuanced hypotheses regarding the contributions of different cognitive and memory systems to different aspects of algebraic learning; the dynamic interactions between these systems and developmental change in math attitudes and anxiety as related to engagement in the mathematics classroom and algebraic learning and cognition; and, the cognitive and non-cognitive factors that contribute to gender differences in certain aspects of algebra, specifically girls? disadvantage in spatial aspects of algebra and their undervaluation of mathematics. The combination will significantly advance our understanding of algebraic learning and cognition, and lead to the development of better assessment measures and targeted interventions to address individual and gender differences in algebraic learning."
"9241024","Sedation precludes ~10% of Veterans from colonoscopy due to no escorts. They accept scheduled unsedated colonoscopy. The option effectively manages no shows due to no escort. Other Veterans prefer no sedation. Insertion water exchange (WE) is significantly less painful than air insufflation. The addition of cap-assisted colonoscopy (WECAC) further reduces pain warrants confirmation. Colonoscopists with variable experience will assess generalizability of WECAC vs. WE. Both male and female Veterans will be recruited. Primary Hypothesis: Real-time maximum insertion pain (RTMIP) is significantly lower in the Veterans examined by WECAC vs. WE. Secondary Hypotheses: WECAC produces significantly higher quality colonoscopy outcomes in both male and female Veterans. Exploratory hypotheses: Co-variables affect Veterans' report of RTMIP. Method: Consenting Veterans will be randomized (computer generated random numbers in permuted block design with variable block sizes of 4 and 6), with code revealed at insertion of the endoscope. Gender will be a stratification factor. The investigators will be a blocking factor for the randomization to obtain treatment balance across investigators, however in the analytical phase the data from these investigators will be combined to assess the primary endpoint. Consent covers agreement to be randomized, respond to questionnaires, and allow recording of the examination for analysis, all in a de-identified fashion. State-of-the-art endoscopic equipment is in place. The investigators and support staff have extensive experience in both techniques. To ensure quality performance, both study and control groups are expected to maintain successful cecal intubation rate >95%. Applicable data management, human subject protection, adverse event monitoring and data security measures will be used. Sample size determination. Pilot data by 4 VA investigators in scheduled unsedated male Veterans were updated. The real time maximum insertion pain (RTMIP) [mean (SD)] was 2.7 (2.2) with WE (n=87) and 1.5 (2.1) with WECAC (n=38). The reduction (44%) 2.7-1.5=1.2 is 1.2/2.2=0.55 standard deviation (SD) units. The sample size/group needed to detect a difference at a level of significance of 0.0492 (adjusted for Obrien-Fleming interim stopping rules, one interim analysis at 50% completion) with 90% power is 72 or 144 total using a two-sided two sample t-test. Assuming 90% of subjects will be evaluable, we plan to recruit 160 male Veterans. For the male Veterans, over a 51 month period, 260 will be eligible and approached by research coordinators; 160 (80/arm) will be recruited. After receipt of the critique, the PI identified 9 scheduled unsedated female Veterans (5 WE, 4 WECAC). RTMIP were WE, 6.2 (3.5) and WECAC, 3.5 (3.7). The reduction (44%) was 2.7/3.7 or 0.7 SD unit. The female Veterans had higher RTMIP than the male Veterans, but the percent reduction (both 44%) of RTMIP by WECAC was equivalent. The sample size/group needed to detect a difference at a level of significance of 0.0492 (adjusted for Obrien-Fleming interim stopping rules, one interim analysis at 50% completion) with 90% power is 43 or 86 total using a two- sided two sample t-test. Assuming 90% of subjects will be evaluable, we plan to recruit 96 female Veterans. For the female Veterans, over a 51 month period, 184 to 191 will be eligible and approached by research coordinators; 96 (48/arm) will be recruited. At each VA site, the Women's Health clinic will assist the research coordinator to inform all female Veterans of the availability of the scheduled unsedated option. Data analysis: Prospective data will be analyzed by Fisher exact, ?2, Student t, linear or logistic regression, nonparametric methods and hierarchical model as indicated. Interim analysis will be performed to assess significant efficacy. Significance: Meeting patient unmet needs and preference. Long term goal: To address adenoma detection and interval cancer prevention in unsedated Veterans with the least painful insertion technique."
"9261783","Project Summary/Abstract Recent evidence has highlighted the critical importance of the perivascular niche in the bone marrow as the main site where hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) reside. Studies have increasingly shown that an alteration in the bone marrow (BM) niche components can promote blood disease initiation and progression. Our research focus is on a key component of the vascular niche: bone marrow endothelial cells (BMECs). Previous studies have shown the importance of BMECs in promoting HSPC engraftment and reconstitution. Our goal is to understand how an abnormality in the niche can impact angiogenesis, hematopoiesis and blood disorders. To this end, a novel inducible mouse model was generated in our laboratory to specifically introduce a KRas or NF1 mutation in endothelial cells. Preliminary data indicate that this mutation significantly impacted hematopoiesis in a manner reminiscent of myeloproliferative disorders. To test our hypothesis, we will inject adult mice with Tamoxifen to activate KRasG12D signaling in BMECs. To complement this study, we will also transplant BM cells from wild-type (WT) mice into lethally irradiated KRasG12D and WT mice to define the effects of non-hematopoietic endothelial KRasG12D signaling on hematopoiesis and angiogenesis. Complete blood counts, flow cytometry and histopathology techniques will be used to inform us of any hematopoietic change. To investigate how an abnormal endothelial niche impacts the functional output of hematopoiesis, in Aim 1, we will perform a competitive transplant with BM cells from KRasG12D mice or controls along with competitor cells into lethally irradiated WT recipients. Our preliminary data suggest that KRasG12D mice have altered chimerism in all blood lineages. Our transplant studies, complemented with in vitro studies will provide a better understanding on how a niche alteration can modify the hematopoietic landscape, thereby biasing hematopoiesis toward the myeloid lineage. In Aim 2, molecular studies will shed light on which cellular pathways and signaling components are involved. Our initial studies suggest that an abnormal endothelial niche promotes the secretion of pro-angiogenic cytokines from HSPCs, which also have decreased quiescence. As research has shown that patients with blood disorders have abnormal vasculature in their BM, confocal microscopy and related software will be used to examine any abnormal vasculature and microvessel density. It is crucial to understand how each niche component can be a contributing factor. As limited scholarship exists on the contribution of abnormal BMECs in blood diseases, our research is intended to bridge that gap in knowledge. Only by considering both aberrant blood cells and their niche would it be possible to achieve more effective therapy in patients that are resistant to chemotherapy. Our research thus has broad implications in the field of blood disorders. Clinically, this could help to identify new targets and to develop better therapeutic strategies in order to improve survival and prognosis in myeloproliferative disorders/myelodysplastic syndromes and other blood disease patients."

"9371414","PROJECT SUMMARY Emerging evidence indicates that platelets, which have a well-established role in the pathophysiology of thrombosis, have a complex and dynamic role in modulating inflammation. Our recent studies have associated platelets with both anti- and pro-inflammatory properties via platelet/leukocyte interactions. Based on the platelet paradigm in hemostasis and thrombosis, we provide evidence platelet/monocyte and platelet/neutrophil interactions represent a ?platelet-dependent switch? that alters leukocyte phenotype and function during the dysregulated inflammatory response associated with sepsis. The medical management of sepsis remains a worldwide problem, and sepsis ranks in the top 10 causes of death in the U.S. As sepsis progresses, the dynamic interplay between platelets, thrombosis, and inflammation presents major challenges to understanding the molecular pathophysiology of the disease. We have documented the platelet adhesion receptor glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX is a modulator of serum cytokine levels, monocyte phenotype, and neutrophil phenotype during the progression of sepsis in animal models. We also correlate human GPVI platelet haplotypes with circulating pro-inflammatory platelet microparticle (pMPs) levels released following platelet activation. Based on these preliminary findings we propose the testable hypothesis: the interaction of neutrophils and monocytes with circulating non-activated platelets dampens inflammation; whereas interaction with activated platelets or pMPs enhances inflammation. To test this hypothesis, we propose Aim 1: to define the mechanism by which GPIb-IX dependent platelet-leukocyte interactions affect cell phenotype, activation state, and cytokine release; and Aim 2: to demonstrate that platelet activation, and more specifically the platelet GPVI-dependent release of pMPs, induces pro-inflammatory leukocyte phenotypes following the induction of a systemic inflammatory response. Completion of these studies will define the functional role and mechanisms by which platelets regulate inflammatory responses and will represent a significant advancement in understanding the pathophysiology of sepsis in patients. This new knowledge should drive innovative strategies for the diagnosis and clinical management of sepsis and long term provide clinicians with critical information for managing septic patients receiving anti-platelet therapy."
"9306843","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past several decades, it has been shown that breast lumpectomy is as effective as mastectomy (total or radical) when clear margins are achieved, i.e. no cancer is evident in the margins as encapsulated cancerous breast tissue is resected. Specifically, clear margins have a 5-year recurrence rate of approximately 2-7% (the same as the more radical procedures) while that risk increases to as much as 22% if positive resection margins are present. The difficulty with determining surgical margins intraoperatively, i.e. tumor localization, is that geometric and spatial cues are quickly lost in the OR presentation which differs considerably from the pendant presentation for most diagnostic imaging studies. Generating surgical technologies that could improve the fidelity of resection would have dramatic impact to this considerable population of patients (nearly 230,000 women per year in the United States alone with 80% being detected at stages 0, 1, or 2) especially when considering recurrence rates. The combination of biomechanical computational models of soft tissue deformation with intraoperative guidance and imaging technologies to create interactive displays to help navigate and localize the tumor would be an important step forward in improving the outcomes of lumpectomy. Our hypothesis in this application is that tumor localization is a major confounding factor for improving MR-driven resections as well other complementary disease detection methods (e.g. radioguided probes, optical imaging technologies, etc.). The specific aims of the application are: (1) generate a platform technology with accompanying computational model-enhanced approach to align preoperative MR imaging data to the surgical field for conducting BCS, and (2) acquire feasibility data using two bystander patient studies (n=6 each) measuring the extent and nature of breast deformations and assess initial model-enhanced registration framework."
"9265835","Thiamin is an essential component of the human diet with an RDA of 1.2 mg. It is also an important commercial chemical and it is widely used as a food additive and flavoring agent. Annual production, by chemical synthesis, is on the order of 3,300 tons. Thiamin-dependent enzymes play an important role in carbohydrate and branched-chain amino acid metabolism. At this time, our mechanistic understanding of this class of enzymes is sophisticated. In contrast, while thiamin was the first vitamin identified, our understanding of its biosynthesis is still incomplete because the biosynthetic pathway is complex and involves unprecedented reaction chemistry. The long-term goal of our research is the complete mechanistic understanding of the enzymology of thiamin biosynthesis, salvage and catabolism, in all forms of life and the elucidation of connections between thiamin metabolism and other aspects of cellular physiology. In the next grant period, we describe studies designed to elucidate the biosynthesis of the thiamin thiazole and pyrimidine in both bacteria and eukaryotes. These heterocycle forming reactions involve novel biological chemistry. Our strategy will involve a combination of kinetics, modified substrates, protein mutagenesis and structural studies. We will also identify the genes involved in thiamin breakdown and salvage. Bacteria, in the human digestive tract, containing these genes are likely to play an important role in controlling the human thiamin RDA. Finally, we will explore the use of 18F-thiamin as a PET imaging agent, ultimately to determine the global thiamin distrubution in healthy and diseased humans. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Thiamin (vitamin B1) is essential for all forms of life. Our studies will facilitate the commercial production of thiamin by fermentation and have potential applications in the design of new antibiotics. Understanding thiamin catabolism and salvage will enable us to evaluate the importance of these activities in the human digestive tract. 18F-thiamin has potential use, as an imaging agent, in basic human biology and in tumor detection."
"9280006","TR&D4 - Integrated pipeline for data analysis Summary Computer programs are essential to the practice of modern NMR spectroscopy, because the quantity of data and the sophistication of the requisite numerical analyses simply cannot be treated without application of efficient and high-speed software. This situation, which applies across all of biological NMR spectroscopy, is particularly critical in applications to conformational dynamics of biological macromolecules because the underlying physical processes are highly complex and the NMR data under the best of circumstances cannot fully capture such complexities. In such an under-determined situation, careful data quantification, model-building, statistical analysis, and cross-validation are essential to generation of robust results. Existing software for analysis of spin relaxation and other NMR data for such investigations largely has been written for expert users by experts in the NMR techniques (but not necessarily expert computer scientists) and is largely piecemeal. For effective promulgation of the experimental technological research and developments at the Center on Macromolecular Dynamics by NMR Spectroscopy (CoMD/NMR) to the broader scientific community, modern, integrated, user-friendly software programs and data analysis pipelines are essential. TR&D4 will develop the necessary software in a feedback cycle with the other TR&D and DBP components, building on the pioneering efforts of the lead investigators for this TR&D."

"9272422","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aims of this proposal are designed to uncover biological functions of the human Y chromosome beyond reproduction, which will have significant implications for human health and disease. Until now, Y chromosome research has focused solely on two functions: sex determination and sperm production. Our ongoing genomic studies of multiple mammalian Y chromosomes have revealed a set of broadly expressed, dosage sensitive regulatory genes that have been conserved on the Y chromosome. Because many of these broadly expressed genes likely have important and widespread biological functions, we hypothesize that the disruption of these genes may contribute to disease, especially Turner syndrome and diseases with sex-biased prevalence, susceptibility, or severity. Historically, deletion-mapping studies have focused solely on the Y chromosome's testis-specific genes, which are involved in sex determination and sperm production. We will perform the first systematic examination of phenotypes associated with disruption of the Y chromosome's broadly expressed genes by studying ~75 patients with Y-chromosome anomalies affecting one or more of these genes. We will evaluate phenotypes of patients using a combination of approaches: 1. At the NIH Clinical Center, patients will undergo a thorough examination of all major organ systems, including physical, reproductive, endocrinologic, and radiologic tests. We will characterize phenotypic abnormalities in patients, detecting patterns that correlate with particular Y-linked gene defects. Bringing patients to the Clinical Center ensures that all testing will be conducted in the most rigorous and systematic manner possible, thus allowing the identification of previously overlooked phenotypes. 2. In the Page lab, the cellular and molecular phenotypes of the same set of patients will be characterized using a combination of whole-genome approaches: RNA-seq and ChIP-seq. We will perform similar analyses in controls with intact Y chromosomes to identify perturbations in chromatin modification, transcript level, or splicing efficiently that may be linked to Y-chromosome defects. Through comprehensive phenotypic characterization, at molecular, cellular, anatomical, and physiological levels, of individuals with Y-chromosome anomalies, we can begin to understand the contribution of Y-linked genes to basic biological processes and fundamental differences between the sexes. Ultimately, these insights could lead to a greater appreciation of the etiology of Turner syndrome phenotypes and the underlying causes of sex biases in disease."
"9266687","Microtubules and their nnotors mediate the intracellular movement of cargos and control of cell structure that  underlie processes such as cell polarization and motility. Consisting of a/|3-tubulin heteropolymers, MT  minus-ends are anchored in the perinuclear MT Organizing Center (MTOC) while their plus-ends radiate  toward the cell periphery. Most MTs dynamically grow and shrink rapidly. However, a subset (<10%) become  stabilized in response to various physiological signals, acquiring post-translational modifications such as de-  tyrosination or acetylation, and are thought to act as specialized tracks for vesicle transport. The end-binding  protein, EBl tracks MT plus-ends and regulates both MT dynamics and stabilization by recruiting a variety of  plus-end binding regulatory proteins (+TIPs). +TIP binding responds to signal pathways such as Rho-mDia  and Akt-GSK-3p. MTs also play a critical yet poorly understood role in the trafficking of pathogens. Herpes  Simplex Virus type 1 (HSV-1) infects ~60-90% of the world population, establishing life-long infections that  result in periodic disease recurrence, ranging from cold sores to fatal encephalitis. While it is established that  HSV-1 induces a-tubulin rearrangements and exploits MT motors for intracellular movement, the precise  nature of MT modifications and their role in infection, as well as potential roles for specialized MT regulatory  factors remain unknown. Our preliminary data shows that HSV-1 causes centrosomal MTOC dispersal and  MT disorganization early in infection of primary normal human dermal fibroblasts. This occurred concomitant  with the loss of EB1 comet staining, indicative of MT plus-end tracking, and was dependent on viral gene  expression. Co-immunoprecipitation identified a candidate EBI-binding protein synthesized in infected cells  while RNAi-mediated depletion of EBl prevented MT reorganization and potently inhibited infection. As  infection progressed, EBl comet staining returned as extensive MT re-growth and stabilization occurred.  Depletion of EBl or CLASP2, a GSK-3P-regulated +TIP that controls MT growth from the Trans Golgi  Network (TGN), a known alternate MTOC, significantly impaired HSV-1 infection. In cells infected with HSV  1 lacking the viral kinase, Us3, which stimulates GSK-3p phosphorylation, MTs remained bundled around the  TGN, the site of secondary virus envelopment. We aim to determine the role of specialized host MT end-  binding proteins and viral factors in regulating MT dynamics and stabilization at discrete phases of HSV-1  infection in different natural target cell types, defining their role in mediating virion trafficking and spread. This  will provide important insight into not only the lifecycle of this ubiquitous human pathogen but also more  general mechanisms of MT regulation and macromolecular transport.  RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Microtubules regulate intracellular cargo movement and changes in cell structure that play critical roles in  various biological processes, yet their regulation remains poorly understood in many contexts including viral  infection. In this proposal we aim to determine the role of specialized MT regulatory proteins and MT subsets  in HSV-1 infection of a variety of natural target cell types. This will not only provide important insight into the  replication of this ubiquitous human pathogen, with the potential to uncover novel antiviral targets, but will  also add to our broader understanding of fundamental mechanisms of MT regulation and cargo transport."
"9308855","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  Image-based analyses as a means of modifying Radiation Therapy to customize treatment based on an individual patient's prognosis or early response to treatment is a research area crucial to the success of this program project. Project 3 investigates the hypothesis that, given the underlying heterogeneity of tumors and normal organs and their response to treatment, anatomic, metabolic and physiologic images (as acquired in the clinical projects of this program) are best utilized for individualizing therapy by robustly identifying subvolumes that are more predictive than individual voxels or the entire tumor/normal organ as a w/hole, and providing these subvolumes as a spatial guide for radiation dose redistributions such as focal boosting. Aim 1 will improve reconstruction of physiological images. Aim 2 is to investigate methods of Identifying subvolumes predictive of response. Aim 3 will improve the accuracy of mapping subvolumes to patients to guide modification of radiation therapy dose distributions. Pattern recognition techniques will be developed for subvolume identification, and correlated with outcomes (e.g. sites of local failure).  Complementary and redundant information from different imaging methods (e.g. 11C Methionine PET and DCE MRI in gliomas) for local response prediction will be studied, as well as the reproducibility of imaging signals and extracted subvolumes (from test-retest data). Methods to improve physiological imaging and analysis, including direct analysis of pharmacokinetics via pattern recognition, and sparsely sampled parallel MR! reconstructed using compressed sensing to resolve organ movement and improve the temporal resolution and/or volumetric coverage, will be investigated. To guide therapy individualization, subvolumes need to be mapped geometrically to the treated patient, with uncertainties due to the limits of image registration accuracy. Finite element models will be investigated as atlases to regularize the intensity-based  deformable alignment methods used to place these subvolumes in the space of treatment planning CT scans acquired for the purposes of planning and/or modifying treatment."

These students may have already attained their baccalaureate degrees, but do not have the credentials for entry into top biomedical graduate programs where prior research experience and high standardized test scores are essential criteria for admittance. We have identified several potential pools from which to recruit such students. Our PREP program will continue to provide opportunities to these students who need to strengthen their credentials for entry into doctoral education. Based on our past accomplishments (8/11 past scholars now enrolled in doctoral graduate programs), UAB provides a fertile training ground to prepare PREP scholars for entry into the most competitive graduate training programs. Our overall goal is to recruit 8 students per year and to provide them a high quality research experience in the laboratories of NIH-funded mentors and multiple academic enrichment opportunities to equip them to be competitive for entry into biomedical graduate programs at top NIH-funded institutions. The students will work with their mentors to develop a challenging research project at which they will spend 80% or more of their time. An individual development plan (IDP) will also be designed for each student, to address any academic weaknesses that might affect success in future graduate attainment. The IDP will provide activities to strengthen writing and quantitative skills, provide career information, develop presentation skills, discuss research ethics, and foster networking with peers at scientific meetings, such as the Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students. The PREP Scholar's progress toward meeting the goals of their IDP will be monitored at least quarterly in meetings with Dr. Engler and their research mentor. The program will also provide opportunities for the scholars to interact with graduate students and student organizations (such as the Black Graduate Student Association), to build a sense of community and support for the scholars. We expect that continuing the already successful PREP Scholars program at UAB will increase the number of minority applicants who are well prepared for entry into top doctoral programs."
"9474720","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Right ventricular failure is the primary cause of mortality in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension and there currently are no therapies to reverse right ventricular dysfunction. Other's work and our own preliminary data have suggested altered metabolism including decreased fatty acid oxidation and lipid deposition may contribute to right ventricular failure in both human pulmonary arterial hypertension and in rodent models of RV dysfunction associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension. We have identified both fatty acid oxidation and increased lipid transport into cardiomyocytes as mechanisms that promote right ventricular lipid accumulation. Moreover, in preliminary data we have used MR spectroscopy to measure lipid deposition in the right ventricle of a patient with pulmonary arterial hypertension and found 10 fold higher percent triglyceride compared with controls. Based on these preliminary data, we now hypothesize that cardiomyocyte lipid deposition promotes RV failure in pulmonary arterial hypertension. Multiple mechanisms may result in right ventricular myocyte lipid deposition including Western diet resulting in increased lipid import or genetic mutations associated with impaired fatty acid oxidation with resultant accumulation of fatty acid metabolites and we propose two specific aims to study the mechanisms leading to lipid accumulation and the effect of deposition on right ventricular dysfunction. Our third specifi aim will translate these findings to humans in a trial of metabolic therapy for right ventricular failure with metformin and test the effect of this fatty acid oxidation enhancer on right ventriculr lipid measured by cardiac magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We will use cell culture, rodent model and human studies to study the mechanisms by which lipid deposition occurs, the functional consequences of lipid accumulation and if metabolic interventions to decrease lipid accumulation will improve right ventricular function in both rodent models and human disease. The long-term goal of these studies is to develop effective metabolic therapy for right heart failure in pulmonary arterial hypertension."
"9485702","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Twenty nine faculty of the Center for Visual Science (CVS) at the University of Rochester request renewal of support for a pre-doctoral and postdoctoral training program that emphasizes two broadly defined areas of vision research: (1) research in physiological optics using advanced optical techniques to study both basic questions about retinal processing and for translational research on eye disease and (2) research into central visual processing using psychophysical, physiological, and computational approaches. Training is interdisciplinary, drawing particularly on the unique technical and intellectual resources of the Center. It covers a broad range of basic and clinical problems in vision, but emphasizes approaches that link visual performance to underlying biological mechanisms. We request each year support for six pre-doctoral trainees, who will generally enter the program through Brain and Cognitive Science, Neuroscience, the Institute of Optics or Biomedical Engineering. Students take core courses plus advanced seminars in visual science, augmented by courses from the department through which they entered the program. They attend regular colloquia, research meetings and the biannual CVS Symposium and Fall Vision Meeting. Concurrently with course work, students complete research projects in CVS preceptor labs We request each year support for one postdoctoral fellow. Postdoctoral training has a heavy emphasis on research. The training grant will be used especially to draw talented scientists from other areas into vision research. We are also requesting stipends for ten summer undergraduate research fellows to participate in an ongoing program that we have developed to introduce students to research in vision science and recruit students into graduate training in visual science."
"9268573","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is a competitive renewal application for a National Research Service Award Institutional Research Training Grant (T32) to further support a Multidisciplinary Rheumatology Training Program at Johns Hopkins. Over the past 4 years, the program has demonstrated outstanding trainee achievement, in the areas of publications, appointment to faculty positions after training, and a very high rate of acquisition f independent, peer-reviewed funding. We demonstrate that the overall trajectory of this program remains steeply positive, with outstanding divisional and institutional resources available to postdoctoral fellows in rheumatology, continued growth and enhancement of the program faculty, and a pool of highly competitive applicants (including women and under-represented minorities). The program has very engaged and highly expert internal and external advisory committees, who provide real-time advice about the program's priorities, systems and directions. Members of the program faculty have a breadth of interests and expertise, and are proven mentors in the rheumatic diseases, immunology, molecular biology and genetics, cell biology, epidemiology and biostatistics. The overall goal of this program remains the development of 2 postdoctoral fellows each year (4 trainee slots total) into outstanding academic investigators in rheumatic disease, through rigorous instruction in research methodology and immersion in outstanding quality mentored research projects.  Our training environment is focused on providing a productive clinical and translational research training program. The following specific aims will be pursued: [1] Provide rigorous training in investigational methods to rheumatology postdoctoral fellows, applicable to the conduct of both clinical and basic research; [2] Utilize clinical centers of excellence to provide access to well-defined rheumatic disease patient populations, enabling fellow projects to be efficiently conducted on established patient cohorts; [3] Engage postdoctoral fellows in high caliber research projects addressing important questions under the supervision of nationally renowned faculty; [4] Integrate multi-layered mentorship for each postdoctoral fellow to accomplish productive research, independence, and development of a successful academic career; and [5] Assess, and modify as needed (through incorporating feedback from trainees, training program faculty, and internal and external advisory committees), the outcomes of this training environment through assessing benchmarks of academic and programmatic achievement, including peer-reviewed publications, external research funding, post-training academic position, and recruitment of underrepresented minorities."
"9267541","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to investigate how signals in the amniotic fluid (AF) and nascent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) instruct neural stem cell behavior during early brain developmental stages surrounding the time of neural tube closure (E8.5-E10.5). The rapidly changing and growing population of neural stems at these early stages will give rise to all neurons and glia in the adult brain, yet comparatively few studies exist on the intrinsic genetc programs or the extrinsic fluid-based signals involved in driving these early stages of development, largely due to technical limitations. We and others have demonstrated broad influences of CSF and vascular fluid niches in instructing later stages of brain development. Yet virtually nothing is known about the protein composition of AF and early CSF during early brain development, at a time when the choroid plexus and vasculature have yet to form. Our overarching hypothesis is that secreted signals in the AF and nascent CSF are critical in instructing and synchronizing the proliferation and fate of embryonic E8.5-E10.5 neural stem cells bathed in these fluids. We will first test this hypothesis by comparing the effects of AF, early CSF and buffered media on stem cell explants at ages E8.5 and E10.5. We predict that, as in later development, early explants only develop normally when bathed in the age-appropriate fluid, suggesting that changes in the AF/CSF proteome are mirrored by changes in expression of associated receptors at the apical surface of neural stem cells. As such, we expect that normal stem cell function should be impaired by genetic perturbations to the cilia and membrane of neural stems cells at their apical surface, which is in direct contact with the AF/CSF. A near- complete list of CSF proteins and their associated receptors on apical membranes will then be deduced using quantitative mass-spec and RNAseq technologies, together with immunostaining. We will then determine the contributions of CSF-LIF and other top candidate proteins in instructing specific aspects of E10.5 stem cell behavior, and the embryonic sources of these CSF signals. This proposal has important clinical significance: We currently have relatively little understanding of the origins of early developmental disorders (defects due to errant neural tube closure, hydrocephalus, and infiltration by teratogens), and scant capacities for early diagnosis or intervention. This proposal should provide a foundation for asking how these early perturbations ultimately derail some or all aspects of normal brain development, and for developing minimally invasive AF/CSF sampling and replacement strategies for disease diagnosis and for reprogramming of neural stem cells in order to bring the development brain back on track."
"9324238","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The ten peer-reviewed and NIH funded Collaborative Projects and the eight Service Projects from leading  hyperpolarized MR sites, that are the scientific driving force behind the HMTRC, demonstrate a clear need for  the improved HP probes and techniques, realistic pre-clinical models and correlative pathology and biology  methodologies that will be provided by this TR&D project. TR&D2 builds on our significant experience in the  DNP polarization/dissolution process, the development of new hyperpolarized molecular probe preparations,  and in the development and testing of novel biologically relevant NMR-compatible pre-clinical cell/tissue culture  and associated novel cell/tissue graft murine models. In the current funding cycle, we developed new 13C  labeled HP probes of glycolysis, TCA cycle and cellular redox as well as multi-polarization approaches that  provide simultaneous information on metabolism, perfusion, and extracellular pH (pHe). Through this renewal,  we aim to greatly improve these HP probes and methods with an emphasis on increased sensitivity,  robustness, cost-effectiveness, ease of dissemination, and translatability. This will be accomplished through  the use of glassing agents, chemically optimized new radicals, and polarization methods. We will also  investigate novel HP probes of pHe, ROS and immune response and to address new questions raised by the  CP's (aim 1). In this renewal, we will also investigate new long-lived hyperpolarized probes and use of lower  field MRI scanners in order to prolong the T1's of hyperpolarized probes. In the current project, novel 10 and 5  mm MR and PET compatible 3D cell and tissue culture bioreactors were micro-engineered, robustly and cost-  effectively produced, and extensively tested and validated in cell and tissue culture studies performed in the  CP's. Driven by the needs of the CP's, we now propose future bioreactor designs incorporating new biologic  measurement capabilities, addition of novel cell culture constructs, development of a micro-bioreactor system,  and extension of human cell & tissue bioreactor studies to novel murine models (aim 2). TR&D2 also made  substantial progress developing and implementing procedures to provide correlative pathologic, biologic and  imaging data critical for understanding and validating HP MR findings in the CP's. As requested by the EAC  and CP's, these validation studies will be augmented by the addition of new metabolomics, enzyme activity  staining assays, and PET/HP MR correlative studies (aim 3). While the HP MR probes, model systems and  correlative methodologies have been specifically developed for the CP's through a highly productive push-pull  approach, these technology developments also have significantly benefited the SP's and the HP MR  community in general through extensive dissemination and training as will be continued and expanded through  this renewal."
"9266689","A number of viruses exhibit bidirectional transport along microtubules following cell entry. Cytoplasmic dynein has been implicated in virus transport toward the nucleus, but the role of kinesins is poorly understood. They might either aid in virus infection, or serve in host defense. Adenovirus provides a simple model for addressing these questions and is the focus of this proposal. Prior studies from this lab worked out the mechanism for dynein recruitment to the adenovirus capsid, and identified roles for protein kinase A (PKA) in virus transport as well as in host cell defense. The Aims of the proposed studies are 1) to identify kinesins involved in plus end-directed adenovirus transport during the early stages of infection; 2) to determine the role of kinesins in host-adenovirus interactions; and 3) to test the effect of microtubule stabilization and posttranslational modifications on live adenovirus transport. The latter Aim will make use of high-resolution live adenovirus particle tracking analysis, and is designed to take advantage of and complement the Aims of other projects described in this Program Project application. The proposed investigation of adenovirus alone has important implications for understanding the cellular mechanisms involved in virus infection, identifying novel mechanisms for host cell defense, and improving the design of gene targeting vectors."

"9408101","Project Summary  Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated budding yeast that causes a life-threatening illness in immunocompromised individuals, especially in AIDS patients. Although the infection starts in the lung, cryptococcosis commonly presents as meningoencephalitis, which is one of the most common infections of the central nervous system and a leading cause of death in HIV-infected individuals. Transmigration of C. neoformans across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is believed to be one of the most critical steps in the development of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis. In vitro studies have shown that C. neoformans can transmigrate across a monolayer of brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) through transcytosis and ?Trojan horse? pathways. However, in vivo the BBB is a complex tissue that consists of BMECs, pericytes, astrocyte end feet, and a basement membrane in a precise organization, which cannot at present be recreated in vitro. Questions still remain as to how C. neoformans migrates to the brain across the BBB in vivo and what is the underlying mechanism(s). Answering these questions is fundamental for understanding cryptococcal pathogenesis, because brain invasion is the hallmark feature of this disease and meningoencephalitis is the major and most lethal complication of cryptococcosis. In contrast to previous in vitro studies that did not account for vascular haemodynamics, we have developed a novel in vivo model system based on multiple novel approaches to directly investigate the brain invasion by C. neoformans in vivo. In this project, we will use this in vivo system to study traversal of the BBB by C. neoformans by addressing the following aims: 1) To characterize the transcytosis of C. neoformans and the mechanism underlying this pathway in vivo. 2) To investigate the ?Trojan horse? pathway and the underlying mechanism during brain infection in vivo. 3) To characterize the mechanism(s) whereby C. neoformans damages the BBB in vivo. 4) To determine the relative contribution of each mechanism to brain invasion by C. neoformans. At the end of the proposed work, we will have identified the in vivo mechanism(s) by which C. neoformans traverses the BBB. The knowledge created in this study will provide new potential therapeutic targets of intervention for this disease."
"9281091","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Secreted and cell-surface-localized Immunoglobulin Superfamily proteins (`extracellular IgSFs') are important class of proteins, which includes proven targets for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and cancer. The human proteome contains ~500 extracellular IgSFs, the largest superfamily of cell surface molecules that contribute to the regulation of innate and adaptive immunity, via specific IgSF:IgSF interactions at the `Immunological Synapse formed between antigen-presenting cells and T-cells.  Our long-term goal is to understand the principles underlying molecular recognition and selectivity at the immunological synapse through a multi-disciplinary program exploiting complementary computational and experimental approaches. These studies are essential to (i) understand the molecular basis of normal immune function associated with IgSFs; (ii) define the mechanisms underlying IgSF-associated dysfunction and disease, and (iii) define strategies to re-engineer IgSF receptor:ligand interactions for the realization of surgically defined mutants with altered affinities and selectivities, which can act as biologic drugs (as demonstrated by FDA-approved biologics for some of these targets such as Orencia(tm) and Belatacept).  Our goal in this application is (1) to identify the protein-protein binding sites specific for individual IgSF members; here, we will exploit our previously published approaches that combine structure and sequence information that identified functional subfamilies of the IgSF. We also present a new approach that identifies binding sites by their physico-chemical and spatial uniqueness (2) Develop a protein design-aided pharmacophore approach to identify cognate receptor-ligand pairs of IgSFs; We present a new method that exploits the ligand-based pharmacophore drug design concept, where we characterize the receptor:ligand interface by a unique spatial fingerprint of energetically favorable `residue-specific-pharmacophores'. However, instead of ligand binding information here we use preferences of amino acid residues or residue fragments that are obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. (3) Experimentally verify predicted receptor-ligand partners and explore binding specificity of mutants.  Our project will directly expand the current knowledgebase of IgSF:IgSF binding pairs and yield mutant molecules, with altered affinities and selectivities, for therapeutic applications. Our project will also deliver a protein-ligand screening tool applicable to other protein classes, and a novel `uniqueness'-driven hot-spot detection method for mutant design."
"9274059","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 25% of expenditures or mental illnesses and substance abuse are due to acute hospitalizations, and these disorders account for 29% of all hospital days and 22% of all hospital costs in the US.1 Acute episodes of illness causing hospitalization are expensive, but many are avoidable with better illness self-management.2 Some interventions for people with serious mental illness (SMI) reduce relapse and re-hospitalization, but they are neither cost effective nor routinely delivered because they require substantial training and involve frequent in-person or telephonic contact. Research demonstrates the effectiveness of automated telehealth devices in reducing crisis-based care for people with unstable medical illnesses. In contrast, much of the research on telehealth for mental illness has focused on providing real-time clinical contact using telephonic or video-based approaches. Although they reduce travel time, these approaches require considerable professional time and expense. Little research has focused on automated telehealth for psychiatric instability in adults at high risk for hospitalization. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of an automated telehealth device monitored by a mental health clinician that allows daily monitoring of symptoms and preemptive intervention to treat early warning signs of relapse to reduce unnecessary acute service use. Pre-post pilot studies by the PI (Pratt) and others, 3, 4 provide evidence of its feasibility and potential to reduce acute service use in peopl with SMI, but a more rigorous evaluation is needed to evaluate effectiveness and investigate potential mechanisms of action. The aims of this study are to compare the effectiveness of 6 months of in-home automated telehealth with health home Usual Care in reducing use and estimated costs of acute services (ER visits and hospitalizations) (Aim 1), and in reducing psychiatric symptom severity (Aim 2) at 6 and 12 months. We will also study potential mechanisms of action (Aim 3). We will randomly assign 300 people with SMI and psychiatric instability who receive services at 1 of 2 community mental health centers to test the following primary hypotheses: Telehealth compared to Usual Care will be associated with less use and lower estimated cost of acute services (H1) and greater improvement in psychiatric symptoms (H2). Also, illness self-management will mediate the relationship between telehealth and psychiatric symptoms, and preemptive provider contact will mediate the relationship between telehealth and acute service use (H3). We will also explore whether telehealth is associated with an increase in all mental health outpatient clinical contacts to collect data for a potential later formal cost analysis. This study addresses the public health challenge of reducing the personal and financial burden caused by psychiatric instability and avoidable use of acute services among people with SMI by evaluating an in-home automated telehealth device with the potential to reduce psychiatric symptoms and decrease acute service use. Findings could substantially enhance consumer quality of life, and may also help inform policy and practice in the management of other vulnerable groups who are hard to engage in traditional clinic-based care."

"9460134","Project Summary/Abstract Solid tumors cannot grow beyond a few millimeters in size without the support of co-opted stromal cells. The function of different stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment may be subverted in ways that are beneficial for tumor progression. Examples are the tumor-induced and specific polarization of immune/inflammatory cells, conversion of fibroblasts into tumor-supportive myofibroblasts, and dysfunctional tumor endothelial cells. Irregular and hyper-permeable vasculature occurs early when only a few hundred-tumor cells are present. Leaky tumor blood vessels deposit fibrin in a perivascular niche that forms scaffolds for tumor cell growth and invasion as well as sparks angiogenesis. Using a miRNA screen of freshly isolated TECs, I identified a TGF?-regulated miRNA (miR-30c) that controls vascular-directed fibrinolysis in tumors. miR-30c is increased in TECs relative to normal endothelial cells (NECs) whereas its target PAI-1 (a fibrinolysis inhibitor) is strikingly decreased. TECs secrete less PAI-1 and they rapidly degrade fibrin scaffolds resulting in aberrant in vitro sprouting. However, TGF? and miR-30c antagomiRs reduce miR-30c expression which re-instates PAI-1 secretion, diminishes fibrinolysis, and ?normalizes? TEC sprouting in vitro. miR-30c antagomiRs coupled to vascular-tropic nanoparticles enforce vascular-specific PAI-1 expression and strikingly promote robust orthotopic mammary tumor growth in vivo. Thus, manipulation of vascular-specific expression of miR-30c in tumors promotes tumor growth likely due to enhanced fibrin-mediated angiogenesis. I propose an axis between TGF?, miR-30c and PAI-1 in TECs controls the rate of perivascular fibrinolysis and is therefore an important effector of tumor angiogenesis and progression."

"9256517","Three of the investigators on this application (Storrie at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Brooker and Rosen at Johns Hopkins University and Ben Gurion University) have been collaborating for the last 7 years on the vision that application of holography to fluorescence microscopy could simplify 3D microscopy and also capitalize on the super-resolution capabilities afforded by holography. This work, supported by NSF, NIH SBIR, and NIST grants hasnow yielded a 3-dimensional, fluorescence microscopic technique with super-resolving properties. It is based upon a new holography concept called FINCH, developed by two of the investigators (Rosen and Brooker). FINCH is a holographic technique in which the incoherent fluorescence microscope emission is imaged with a simple setup consisting of a spatial light modulator inserted into the light path of a standard fluorescence microscope stand, an attached digital camera, and a non-laser, externally shuttered light source. Recently the FINCH technique was found to have inherent super-resolving properties. This system has been developed to the stage of a bench-top hardware and software prototype. In this proposal, the network of 4 investigators at three universities including Vladimir Lupashin at  University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences will participate in three aspects of the implementation, research use and further improvement ofthe FINCH super-resolution microscope technology.  1. At Johns Hopkins University (JHU), Brooker and Rosen will implement a stand-alone FINCH microscope, supporting algorithms and image acquisition and hologram reconstruction software to be installed at UAMS during the middle of grant Year 2.  2. At University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS), Storrie and Lupashin will utilize the FINCH microscope to advance innovative research in membrane trafficking and Golgi organization that would not otherwise be possible. In that work, they will also compare FINCH microscope performance with other super-resolution techniques.  3. At Ben Gurion University (BGU), Rosen will continue to develop advanced algorithms and concepts based upon FINCH to improve performance and resolving power."
"9366789","Project Summary Wolbachia offer a pesticide-free alternative to curb arbovirus transmission. Current pilot studies release infected mosquitoes to either crash the resident population size or spread mosquitoes with reduced vectorial capacity in the local population. Both efforts rely upon Wolbachia's adaptation to cause cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) - a sperm modification that causes embryonic arrest in crosses between infected males and uninfected females (unidirectional CI) or between males and females harboring different Wolbachia strains (bidirectional CI). However, infected females with the same strain rescue the sperm modification, giving them a large fitness advantage over uninfected females that in turn enables rapid spread of Wolbachia through host populations. Despite four decades of intense research and current applications to vector control, the underlying genetic basis of CI has not been reported. However, we recently identified two prophage WO gene candidates in the released strain of wMel Wolbachia that natively infects Drosophila melanogaster. These genes are hereafter referred to as cytoplasmic incompatibility factor A (cifA) and cytoplasmic incompatibility factor B (cifB). cifA and cifB exhibit enhanced expression in infected host testes, as expected for genes involved in CI. Expression of cifA and cifB transgenes in uninfected D. melanogaster testes recapitulates induction of CI, while expression in Wolbachia- infected testes enhances the wild type CI. Importantly, wMel-infected females rescue the transgene-associated CI, thereby implicating these candidates as likely CI genes. Phylogenies specify divergent clades of cifA and cifB homologs that covary with bidirectional incompatibility relationships between Wolbachia strains. Additionally, recent genome sequencing and comparisons reveal candidate rescue genes that exhibit parallel phylogenies to those of cifA and cifB and preferential expression in early embryos. As these findings represent a potential breakthrough in the search for CI genes, the central hypothesis of the proposed research is that the candidate modification and rescue genes determine unidirectional and bidirectional CI. In Aim 1, we will use transgenic expression of genetically divergent cifA and cifB variants to broadly test the essential cif gene regions for inducing CI and whether extant homologs of these genes retain the ability to induce CI. In Aim 2, we will investigate candidate rescue genes from wMel using transgenic expression in females and crosses with an array of males with CI-inducing Wolbachia or transgene cif homologs. This aim will also explicitly test the presumption that divergence in modification and rescue genes underlies bidirectional CI. Examinations thus far have yet to yield a comprehensive genetic advance for both sides of CI, and the rising interest in deploying Wolbachia to curb arbovirus transmission necessitates an explanation of Wolbachia's drive system. If successful, this research will pioneer genetic studies of bacteria-induced reproductive parasitism, inform Wolbachia's efficacy and delivery as a tool to control diverse zoonotic diseases, and provide multiple lines of evidence for the discovery of genes that underlie CI."
"9326766","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Adult onset neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (ANCL) is a fatal lysosomal storage disease caused by two known dominant mutations in the gene encoding cysteine string protein-? (CSP?): CSP?L115R and CSP?L116?. CSP? forms a chaperone complex with SGT (small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein) and Hsp70/Hsc70 (heat shock protein/cognate 70 kDa) to chaperone the synaptic SNARE protein SNAP-25. It is surprising that mutations in CSP? lead to lysosomal pathology because its role has only been clarified in the context of synaptic function. I have recently found that SNAP-23, a homolog of SNAP-25, is also a client of the CSP?/SGT/Hsc70 chaperone complex. This interaction was found via (i) immunoprecipitation of CSP? from wild type mouse brain followed by tandem mass spectrometry identification of SNAP-23, (ii) reduced protein levels of SNAP-23 in CSP? knockout (CSP?-/-) mouse brains, and (iii) co-immunoprecipitation of SNAP-23 with each member of the CSP?/SGT/Hsc70 chaperone complex. Importantly, SNAP-23 mediates Ca2+-dependent fusion of lysosomes with the plasma membrane by forming a SNARE-complex with VAMP-7 and syntaxin-4. In support of this function, I have identified diminished Ca2+-dependent lysosomal exocytosis in CSP?-/- primary neurons by measuring cell surface exposure of the LAMP-1 luminal domain following intracellular Ca2+ induction with ionomycin. Altogether, these preliminary data draw a new and direct connection between CSP? dysfunction and lysosomal pathology in ANCL by means of impaired SNAP-23 function. Key gaps remain in our understanding of how mutations in CSP? cause the pathological cascade of ANCL: a) how ANCL mutations in CSP? affect chaperoning of SNAP-23, and b) how SNAP-23 dysfunction leads to lysosomal pathology with lipofuscin accumulation. My hypothesis is that ANCL mutations in CSP? prevent the CSP?/SGT/Hsc70 complex from chaperoning the lysosomal SNARE protein SNAP-23, disrupting lysosomal exocytosis and leading to lipofuscin accumulation. This hypothesis will be addressed using a multi-disciplinary approach including primary cortical neurons from CSP?-/- mice, biochemical assays and lentiviral rescue experiments. Experiments will be carried out by means of two proposed specific aims: Aim 1 will clarify how ANCL mutations affect CSP??s chaperoning of SNAP-23: Aim 2 will elucidate how ANCL mutations in CSP? affect lysosomal exocytosis, leading to lipofuscinosis. Completion of these aims will lead to a detailed understanding of the pathological cascade of ANCL, opening future avenues for testing therapeutics strategies."

"9243988","Recent progress in elucidating mechanisms underlying muscular dystrophy and muscle disease has  dramatically increased the number of potentially druggable targets available for therapeutic intervention.  Concurrently, hew approaches have increased the number of compounds that can be tested for activity  against these targets. Together, these trends have stimulated the adoption of high-throughput screening  (HTS) as a primary tool for early-stage drug discovery. HTS has already been applied to a limited set of  muscular dystrophy targets, leading to therapeutics currently being tested in the clinic. This has increased  enthusiasm worldwide and among CDMD Investigators for designing and implementing muscular dystrophy  relevant HTS assays for drug discovery and elucidation of basic aspects of muscle cell biology. UCLA has  already made a tremendous commitment to HTS screening on campus through the Molecular Shared  Screening Resource (MSSR) to facilitate translational medicine, in general. Core B extends this set of  resources to facilitate the screening of muscle/dystrophy relevant targets by providing manpower, cell  models, expertise, eqiuipment and space for cell reprogramming, expansion and banking to support muscle  centric projects. A major focus of the core is developing and distributing human patient cell based dystrophy  models, including iDRM.(induced directly reprogrammable myotubes) and IPSC (induced pleurepotent stem  cells), from patients with Duchenne and other dystrophies for use in HTS and validation of target hits and  other interventions. Thus, the core maximizes impact by leveraging the existing UCLA investment in HTS  technology by providing the needed resources and skills to fill the gaps to make muscle/dystrophy relevant  assays readily and simply feasible on campus for center members. Aim 1) To advise and assist users in  muscle centric HTS assay development, application and data analysis in collaboration with the MSSR; Aim  2) To develop, validate expand, bank and distibute primary/reprogrammed cells derived from Duchenne and  other dystrophy patients; Aim 3) To provide support, expertise, equipment and BSL2+ cuture space for  utilization of developed cell based models for drug/therapy/target validation."
"9384625","Project Summary Pathogenic bacteria display polymeric virulence factors to establish and maintain infections. We will investigate the mechanisms through which these polymers are produced and search for small molecule polymer assembly inhibitors. Two types of surface polymers in Gram-positive bacteria will be studied, (i) pili, proteinaceous fibers that project from the cell surface to mediate adhesion to host tissues, and (ii) Wall Teichoic Acids (WTAs), highly abundant glycopolymers that play a fundamental role in maintaining the integrity of the cell wall. Both pili and WTA polymers are important virulence factors, but how they are synthesized is poorly understood. In aims #1- 2, we will study how the archetypal SpaA-pilus from Corynebacterium diphtheria is assembled by sortase polymerases. These enzymes catalyze a unique transpeptidation reaction that covalently links adjacent protein pilus subunits together via a lysine isopeptide bond, thereby conferring enormous tensile strength that enables bacterial adherence. By synergistically employing structural, biochemical, cellular and chemical tools, we will learn how sortase polymerases build the pilus shaft and define the structure of the fundamental building block from which all Gram-positive pili are constructed. We will also determine the molecular basis through which pilus biogenesis is terminated via a novel handoff mechanism in which the pilus is transferred between tandemly arranged sortases on the cell surface. This work will have a broad impact, as a wide range of pathogenic microbes use a similar mechanism to assemble their pili. In aim #3, we will study how Gram-positive bacteria produce WTA using the TarA enzyme, a novel glycosyltransferase that catalyzes the first committed step in polymer biosynthesis. TarA is a promising drug target, as clinically relevant methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is defective in host colonization and re-sensitized to Beta-lactam drugs when WTA biosynthesis is disrupted. Crystal structures of TarA in its apo- and substrate-bound forms will be determined, facilitating the rational exploration of its catalytic mechanism. High-throughput screening using a novel, cell-based bacterial cytological profiling assay will also be performed to discover small molecule TarA inhibitors that could have useful therapeutic properties. Combined, studies of pilus and WTA biogenesis will provide fundamental insight into the chemistry underlying polymer assembly in Gram-positive bacteria and could lead to novel antibiotics to treat infections caused by MRSA and other multi-drug resistant bacteria."
"9271555","Project Summary/Abstract Social-structural forces - poverty, stigma, racism, and gender inequality - have exacerbated HIV disparities for key populations around the world and particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. As the world moves towards the 90- 90-90 HIV cascade of care goals, in which 90% of individuals living with HIV know their status, 90% of these are linked to care, and 90% of those engaged in care are virally suppressed, the same social-structural forces are likely to push key populations disproportionately into the 10% left behind at each step of the care cascade. Structural interventions that address multiple levels of the social ecology and empower communities to dismantle social and institutional barriers can improve cascade of care outcomes and decrease incidence among key populations. The complexity of these interventions contributes to their success, but also presents a methodological challenge to assess the mechanisms through which they simultaneously create change at individual, community, and institutional levels. This K01 Mentored Research Scientist Career Development Award is designed to provide the PI with training in a mixture of qualitative, quantitative, and geospatial methods to address this challenge. The proposed research will explore how social-structural forces influence the spaces where high risk women in Iringa, Tanzania live, work, and access health care, and how these spaces affect access to HIV testing and linkage to care. This work will build the PI?s skills in 1) Qualitative and quantitative geographic information systems; 2) Latent class analysis with an emphasis on spatial factors; and 3) The design and implementation of community-based social-structural interventions. The project will be nested within an existing NIMH-funded R01 community-based intervention with high-risk women. The research aims are to: 1) Identify spatial clusters of work venues and residential areas in which women are significantly more or less likely to access HIV testing or be linked to care; 2) Use latent class analysis to identify patterns of spatial use, the characteristics of women who are most likely to frequent those spaces, and differences in HIV testing and linkage to care by latent spatial class; and 3) Describe the spatial manifestations of social-structural forces that create barriers to HIV testing and linkage to care from the perspective of local women and identify how these correlate with spatial patterns identified in the first 2 aims. Findings from this study will position the PI to develop an R34 proposal for a geographically targeted and spatially tailored pilot intervention to improve cascade of care outcomes and reduce HIV incidence. The skills gained will allow the PI to transition to independence as an expert in community-based, mixed-methods research and interventions to reduce HIV disparities among key populations."

"9241952","?    DESCRIPTION:  The goal of the proposed project is to determine the feasibility of developing a novel non-invasive and sensitive joint health diagnostic device capable of detecting the integrity of soft-tissue. Soft tissue knee injuries are some of the most common and clinically challenging musculoskeletal disorders seen in the emergency department. Over $10 billion is spent each year repairing soft tissue injuries in the U.S., Europe and Japan and advances over just the last fifty years have shown tremendous improvements for patients who undergo surgical reconstruction. However, there is still plenty of room for improvement as the risk of re-injury and secondary health issues remains high after reconstruction surgery. Other questions also remain such as optimal timing for surgery and the decision as to what sort of surgery or whether to undergo surgery at all exist for young people still growing. Current diagnostics are limited in tha they are expensive, only provide static images of the knee and while good at showing significant damage, are unable to accurately detect a lot of the more minor damage. Further, physical knee exams can indicate minor damage, but these tests are highly subjective, vary tremendously from person to person, and do not provide a clear indication of the joint susceptibility to injury r other minor damage that may indicate future risks. Recent advances in our understanding of the physiology of the knee and the biomechanics of the soft tissue can be coupled with developments in Acoustic Emission sensors and sophisticated signal processing to provide us a unique opportunity to develop a diagnostic tool capable of discerning microdamage related to the overall integrity of the knee. Such a novel non-invasive method could provide integral information that can be used to improve treatments and identify at risk individuals. In the proposed study, we will investigate if there are acoustic emission signal characteristics associated with a variety of health states that can be used for monitoring joint status, recovery or risk of further injury."
"9290853","Protein synthesis governs if, how fast, and how many times cells divide. Yet how protein synthesis is linked molecularly with cell division is unknown. We use budding yeast as a model system to answer this problem. Because yeast has unique properties, suited for genetic and biochemical experiments. New methodologies can identify transcripts that engage with the protein synthesis machinery, the ribosomes, in the process of translation. For the first time in the field, we applied this ribosome profiling methodology in synchronously dividing cells that maintained the physiological coupling of protein synthesis with their division. In this collaborative proposal, we will leverage these findings to tackle the long-standing problem of protein synthesis requirements for cell divisions. In Aim 1, we will determine how translational control of lipogenic enzymes regulates the remodeling of cellular membranes during cell division. Furthermore, we will determine how protein synthesis adjusts the production of proteins that trigger duplication of the spindle pole body, an essential part of the machinery of chromosome segregation. We will also identify translationally regulated mRNAs under dietary restriction, which changes the size of cells and increases the number of times cells divide before they die. In Aim 2, we will extend ribosome profiling to settings of specific ribosomal protein mutants that delay cell division and increase lifespan. These genetic interventions will enable us to identify mRNA targets of translational control that underpin cell division and replicative longevity when protein synthesis is limited. Knowing how translational control affects the timing and number of cell divisions will reveal fundamental links between cell growth, protein synthesis, cell division and aging, enabling novel therapeutic interventions in proliferative diseases."
"9453221","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding the electrophysiology of neural circuits in the human brain is critical for advancing our knowledge of human nature since fast neural communication underlies our remarkable perceptual, motor, and cognitive abilities. Studying such networks requires a method to stimulate one or more nodes of any network with precise timing and a method to accurately measure electrophysiological activity with millisecond time resolution. At present, single-channel transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) devices are used to stimulate one focal region of the cortex and an array of EEG electrodes to measure the consequences of such stimulations on network functions. This type of device can stimulate only one region at a time with a rather diffuse area of stimulation and record brain activity smeared by the intervening scalp, skull and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). We propose to develop and test a novel noninvasive system with the stimulation and recording capabilities required for understanding functional roles of neural circuits in the human brain with high time resolution. In this SBIR Fast-Track project, we will first test the basic 1-channel unit during Phase I. In Phase II, we will construct a 16-channel cryogenically cooled high-density TMS coil array integrated with a 25-channel TMS-compatible atomic gradiometer (AG) array. Phase I - Aim 1A: Construct a 1-channel cryoTMS system with a 30-mm OD coil encased in a tubular miniature cryostat with a 1-cm diameter hole in the middle and an OD of 38 mm and a remote-control positioning mechanism for radially moving the probe to touch the scalp. It will be connected to a liquid nitrogen (LN2) reservoir via a flexible transfer tube for cooling the TMS coil. Aim 1B: Construct an axial miniature AG encased in a rod-like 10 mm2 probe. Phase II - Aim 2A: Construct a 16- channel TMS coil array based on the 1-channel system with an automated positioning system, cooled by a closed-loop 100% LN2 recycler. Aim 2B: MagVenture will construct a 16-channel TMS stimulator specifically for this project and deliver it to Tristan for integration with the TMS system. Aim 2C: Construct a 25-channel AG array based on the 1-channel AG and a controller with a high laser pump power for shortening the recovery time after each TMS pulse to <2 ms We will develop techniques for mass production of these AGs using the MEMS technology. Aim 2D: Develop the software for controlling the TMS stimulator for targeting the E field to desired locations with optimal orientations. Aim 2E: Integrate the 16 TMS coils and 25 AG probes into a single system, inserting an AG probe into the middle hole of each cryostat and between the cryostats for high spatial resolution and test the functionality of the system. Phase II - Aim 3: Evaluate its capabilities on 20 healthy adult volunteers in a magnetic shielding enclosure, using the software capable of controlling the TMS system and measuring MEG signals in real time. We will test if the TMS-MEG system can be used to stimulate one or more nodes of a sensorimotor network and to study functional roles of each node of the network."
"9214719","PROJECT SUMMARY Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive lung disease that is incurable due to the formation of scar tissue and resultant impaired lung function. Approximately 130,000 Americans suffer from IPF, with an estimated 50,000 new cases diagnosed each year. Mortality rates from pulmonary fibrosis have increased significantly in recent years, thereby increasing the demand for pulmonary fibrosis research. Although it is well accepted that fibrosis is a central component of pathogenesis in IPF, the transcriptional program(s) that orchestrate fibrotic processes are poorly defined and represent a major knowledge gap in the field. WT1 is a zinc-finger transcriptional regulator, the function of which has been poorly studied in adult fibrotic lung diseases. We have recently reported direct clinical evidence of WT1 upregulation in lung mesenchymal cells of fibrotic lesions in IPF patients. Our new findings have determined that WT1 functions as a positive regulator of fibroproliferation and ECM production. In support of this, we identified a positive association between the number of WT1-positive cells and total lung hydroxyproline levels in mouse models of TGF?- and bleomycin- induced pulmonary fibrosis. Further, inhibition of WT1 expression in vivo was sufficient to attenuate fibrosis in the lung. Taken together, these findings lead us to postulate that WT1 functions as a positive regulator of fibroproliferation and ECM production in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. For this study, we propose three specific aims: 1) determine whether reduced WT1 expression is sufficient to attenuate fibrproliferation and ECM production; 2) determine whether mesenchymal cell-specific expression of WT1 is critical in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis; and 3) determine the mechanism by which WT1 promotes fibroproliferation and ECM production. We will use complementary primary mesenchymal cell culture and mouse transgenic approaches, coupled with detailed biochemical analysis of these WT1-driven processes in mouse lung tissues. Completion of the proposed experiments is likely to impart a significant understanding of WT1-driven pulmonary fibrosis and its transducers, which may be targeted in the future using novel therapeutics to attenuate pulmonary fibrosis. The multidisciplinary team will facilitate a timely approach with expertise in all aspects of lung pathology and support future translational studies in IPF. Our approach is innovative due to the generation of novel transgenic mice to test WT1 functions and its targets involved in the pathology of pulmonary fibrosis. The proposed research is significant in that completion of this study will increase an understanding of the mechanisms causing IPF, which in turn will lead to advanced medical therapies for the treatment and possible cure or prevention of this debilitating lung disease."
"9312285","Summary The orchestration of growth and differentiation during development is essential for normal mechanical and physiological function of organs and appendages. Despite its importance, the regulation of how coordinated growth occurs such that proportion is maintained is not well understood. To gain insight into this process, we studied the congenital overgrowth disorder macrodactyly characterized by local giganticism of the digits of the hand and feet. Macrodactyly is a unique growth disorder in that the skeletal and soft tissue elements of the digits including nerve, vasculature, muscle and bone are enlarged, however organized such that larger digits form. Thus, patients with macrodactyly represent a unique biologic opportunity to explore fundamental mechanisms of how growth, size and proportion are coordinated within and between tissues. We have identified a specific somatic activating mutation in the catalytic subunit of phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K), encoded by the gene PIK3CA, within affected tissue of macrodactyly patients. This mutation is also commonly found in cancer and other overgrowth disorders; thus, this mutation alone cannot explain the coordinated growth response observed in macrodactyly. How does this particular mutation lead to overgrowth that is coordinated and patterned during the development of the limbs? The restriction of overgrowth to the digits in these patients as opposed to the proximal limb, suggests a role for tissue interactions in the distal limb during development to regulate patterned growth and size. Additionally, we have identified potential modifier mutations arising in concert with PIK3CA that may be essential for PI3K regulation of overgrowth. We hypothesize that PI3K-mediated signaling coordinates growth through specific paracrine signaling from sensory neural tissues during development in a manner that is dependent on signaling between the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) and mesenchymal tissues during limb development. We propose to investigate the regulation of coordinated growth by PI3K through: 1) identification and localization of the affected cells and tissues containing mutant PIK3CA in macrodactyly patients and examination of the effect of these mutant cells on adjacent tissues; 2) use of novel zebrafish models to dissect the genetic and developmental causes of overgrowth though systematic analysis of newly identified secondary modifier mutations in regulating PIK3CA function and 3) the use of a conditional knockin mouse model of activated PIK3CA to test the sufficiency of increased PI3K signaling within specific tissues of the developing mouse limb to phenocopy macrodactyly. The proposed research will define the molecular and tissue level regulation of organ size and growth that will lead to new treatment modalities for a host of overgrowth and neoplastic conditions and yield new strategies for enhancing tissue repair and organ regeneration."

"9333226","Program Abstract - Overall The goal for this renewal application is to a) elucidate oncogenic Kras (Kras*)-regulated metabolic pathways mediating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumor maintenance, b) define collateral metabolic dependencies, and c) establish how interventions targeting these processes influence tumor immunity, in order to guide the design of clinical trials with existing drugs and to identify new therapeutic points of attack. Our P01 program comprises 3 highly interdependent and collaborative projects and 4 essential cores with the goals of conquering PDAC through targeting metabolic vulnerabilities in conjunction with immunotherapy. Project 1 (DePinho with Draetta) has demonstrated that Kras* extinction in PDAC leads to pronounced tumor regression that involves critical functions of Kras* in metabolic reprogramming. We have also identified Kras*-extinction resistant cells (KRCs), which show dramatic adaptive metabolic changes (in OXPHOS and autophagy) allowing survival upon Kras* inactivation. These studies thereby provide benchmarks for successfully targeting Kras* in vivo and predicting resistance mechanisms that may be encountered in the clinic. Thus, the goal of Project 1 is to kill the bulk Kras*-dependent tumor cells through identification of metabolic targets essential for Kras*-mediated PDAC maintenance and to define methods to eliminate KRC through inhibiting autophagy and OXPHOS survival mechanisms. Project 2 (Bardeesy with Kimmelman and Cantley) has discovered that PDAC is dependent on lysosome-dependent nutrient scavenging pathways for metabolic homeostasis and tumor growth, and has identified a transcriptional program that activates these processes. The goal of Project 2 is to decipher how lysosomal scavenging supports PDAC growth and how cancer cells can escape their dependence on these processes, thereby informing improved therapeutic approaches. Project 2 will identify the metabolic outputs of lysosomal mediated recycling pathways, establish which of these outputs play roles in PDAC growth, and explore metabolic escape pathways in order to identify novel therapeutic combinations synergizing with lysosomal inhibition. Project 3 (Kalluri with Allison) has defined profound alterations in the tumor microenvironment, including a prominent CD8 T cell infiltration following Kras* extinction in PDAC. Project 3 will define the immune profiles throughout the genesis, regression and recurrence of PDAC and will determine the causal role of CD8 and CD4 cells in PDAC regression, as well as explore new opportunities to test the efficacy of checkpoint blockade therapy and assess the associated adaptive mechanisms underlying immune suppression. Furthermore, Project 3 will determine the direct impact of metabolically targeted therapy on tumor immunity and define effective methods to combine such therapies with immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Highly innovative cores for Pathology (Maitra), Preclinical Therapeutics (Benes), Computation (Futreal), and an Administrative Core will enable these Projects."

"9275041","During the initial funding period, our group developed a novel Diffusion Basis Spectrum Imaging (DBSI)  method to simultaneously detect and quantitate inflammation, demyelination and axon injury in vivo using  diffusion imaging (Wang et al. 2011). DBSI has substantially improved the accuracy and specificity of our prior  diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) approach, by overcoming the main inadequacies of DTI. We hypothesize that  DBSI can quantitate the proportions of axon injury, demyelination, and inflammation in CNS of MS patients.  We previously showed using a mouse model that DBSI detects and quantitates axonal and myelin injuries that  had escaped detection by standard imaging, and by DTI. Our preliminary data now include validation of  DBSI using autopsied and biopsied human specimens, with favorable correlations with human  histology. We also now have longitudinal data spanning 1.5 yrs, and comparisons of DBSI with  magnetization transfer imaging (MTI). In Project 3, we will apply DBSI to humans with MS, comparing it to  standard MRI, DTI and MTI. Project 3 will classify MS lesion subtypes by measures of axon injury,  demyelination, and inflammation (cellularity and increased free water due to edema or tissue loss), and follow  the patients over 4 years to identify predictors and correlates of clinical deterioration. We expect to achieve this  using DBSI by differentiating prominent axonal injury vs. axon preservation, and demyelination vs. myelin  preservation/ remyelination. We will examine established persistent black holes (PBHs) (new sub-aim),  and perform longitudinal assessments of gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) MS lesions to determine if DBSI will  predict PBH formation, representing severe axon loss. With its ability to profile lesions and normal-appearing  CNS, DBSI could help non-invasively elucidate the substrate of MS lesion formation and detect inflammation  behind an intact blood-CNS-barrier (not detected by Gd+). DBSI has potential to aid development and testing  of new therapies for progressive MS where loss of axons and tissue integrity are believed to play a large role."
"9265500","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Respiratory infections are a common cause of morbidity and mortality in many diseases including Cystic Fibrosis (CF). In spite of current therapies more than 90% of people with CF die from respiratory infections. CF is caused by mutations in the gene for cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), an anion channel. How defects in this anion channel led to respiratory infections is unclear. To better understand CF lung disease, we produced CF null pigs. CF pigs show host defense defects, similar to humans. We found that CF pigs have an abnormally acidic airway surface liquid (ASL), the thin layer of fluid lining the lung epithelia. Increasing the pH of the ASL in CF pigs rescues the host defense defect. Thus, we hypothesize that infections in CF are due to an acidic ASL pH, in part, by a dysfunctional CFTR, which normally secretes HCO3-. In addition to CFTR, a number of ion channels and transporters have been hypothesized to be involved in HCO3- secretion and H+ secretion. However, which ion channels and transporters primarily contribute to ASL pH is unclear. If the dominant pathways can be identified, the most efficacious pharmacological therapy to increase ASL pH and presumably decrease lung infections can be developed. To accomplish this, we propose the following specific aims: 1) Determine the channels and transporters that secrete HCO3- into the ASL 2) Determine the primary mechanism of H+ secretion into the ASL. To determine which HCO3--secreting and which H+-secreting proteins are most important, we will use small interfering RNA (siRNA) to selectively knock down specific mRNAs and pharmacologic agents to inhibit ion channels and transporters. We will measure the effect of inhibiting these proteins on ASL pH in airway epithelia. We will quantify this effect using three techniques: pH sensitive fluorophores, Ussing chamber electrophysiology, and pH stat. By dispersing a pH sensitive fluorophore into the ASL, we can measure the effects of on ASL pH directly. In Ussing Chambers, we will voltage-clamp cultures to measure electrogenic HCO3- transport generated by pharmacologic stimulus. To account for electro-neutral ion transport, we will use pH stat to pH-clamp and measure rates of H+ or HCO3- secretion. We expect that with these techniques, we will identify which proteins contribute most to HCO3- secretion and H+ secretion into the ASL. We will then test the effects on CF host defense defects in vitro by measuring bacterial killing and ASL viscosity. Knowing which proteins are the major contributors to ASL pH, is the first step towards our long-term goal of developing drugs to increase ASL pH. Using our access to CF pigs, we can test the drugs in vivo, and then develop them as therapies for humans. These drugs would have a major impact for not only CF, but also for other diseases like COPD, which also show acidic ASL and bacterial infections. This project is a direct application of understanding a physiology mechanism to better human health, the mission of NHLBI."
"9266263","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) is a longitudinal survey of a nationally-representative sample of U.S. families that began in 1968. With data collected on the same families and their descendants for 39 waves over 47 years (as of 2015), the PSID can justifiably be considered a cornerstone for empirical social science research in the U.S. Through its long-term measurement of economic and social wellbeing, the study has inspired researchers to investigate the dynamics of economic, social, demographic, and health processes and their interrelationships. NICHD has co-funded the collection of the biennial Core PSID interview for all seven waves from 2003 to 2015. This project will build upon this investment in the next five-year cycle through the following specific aims: (1) screen and recruit a new immigrant refresher sample in 2016 and 2017, comprising approximately 750 immigrant households that migrated to the U.S. after 1997 (when PSID last added an immigrant refresher), and interview these families for two rounds of the Core PSID survey in 2017 and 2019; and (2) collect data from all other PSID respondents on three modules-family dynamics, fertility and newborns, and education-from two rounds of the Core PSID survey in 2017 and 2019, covering approximately 9,850 households in 2017 and 10,244 households in 2019. These data will be cleaned, documented, and distributed free of charge through the PSID Online Data Center, which provides customized extracts and codebooks. In addition, continuing outreach and support will be provided to established and new data users. This project will make several major contributions. By screening and recruiting a new immigrant refresher sample into PSID, this project will enhance the representativeness of PSID and the generalizability of results of studies using these data-now and into the future. The ongoing collection of data on family dynamics, children, and education will maintain PSID as the only long-term panel representative of the full U.S. population that can be used to study these topics over the lifecourse, across generations, and over time."
"9452480","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inactivity is a common problem among older kidney transplant recipients and may lead to graft loss and cardiovascular problems.

"9398689","Abstract  Vaccination is perhaps the most effective public health intervention in the history of mankind. Over the past 200 years, there have been many accomplishments in vaccine development with successes against diseases such as smallpox, polio, tetanus, diphtheria, and others. However, there is an ever-growing need for new vaccine technologies to combat diseases that are difficult to target. Furthermore, vaccination may be the only course of action to prevent infectious diseases caused by multi-drug resistant pathogens. The primary objective of the current application is to develop a vaccine platform that allows for the display of both engineered antigens and adjuvants on the surface of non-pathogenic E. coli. This platform permits the use of whole bacteria and outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) as both vaccine production and vaccine delivery systems. In the current application, this innovative, efficient, and cost-effective vaccine platform will be directly applied to the production of a broadly protective, universal influenza vaccine.  Seasonal influenza epidemics cause millions of cases of severe infection per year worldwide and an uncontrolled influenza pandemic could result in the death of tens of millions. The most effective approach to protecting the population from influenza is through vaccination; however, current influenza vaccines are not broadly protective and must be updated yearly in an inefficient, expensive, and laborious process. Our new antigen/adjuvant bacterial display platform has the potential to overcome these weaknesses. The Specific Aims of this proposal are (i) to engineer the bacterial surface of E. coli for display of targeted antigens and adjuvants for protective vaccines, (ii) to engineer the production of polyvalent influenza vaccine offering heterosubtypic immunity, and (iii) to test the efficacy and durability of protection induced by our engineered universal influenza vaccines in ferrets."
"9257049","Terminally differentiated cells are largely post-mitotic, but can become dedifferentiated under certain conditions, which can lead to the development of cancer. Much emphasis has been placed on understanding the mutations enabling dedifferentiation, but less is known about the mechanisms of preventing dedifferentiation. The centrosome presents an attractive target for investigation the prevention of dedifferentiation due to its role in cell cycle regulation and its functional absence in skeletal muscle fibers, which are highly resistant to dedifferentiation. Despite studies demonstrating the loss of some centrosomal proteins during myogenic differentiation, the mechanism mediating this loss and the ultimate fate of the centrosome as a physical structure remains unclear. However, preliminary studies suggest the potential for the presence of centrioles during terminal differentiation. Therefore, we hypothesize that functional, rather than physical, loss of the centrosome is a key step in preventing the dedifferentiation of differentiated cells. Two specific aims are addressed in this proposal: (1) Determine the role of the centrosome in dedifferentiation; (2) Determine the mechanism of centrosome loss during differentiation with respect to the (a) necessity and (b) sufficiency of the candidate proteins for mediating functional centrosome loss, HDAC6, Aurora A kinase, and MST1/STK4. Through the use of microscopy, pharmacological manipulation, and genome engineering, we will investigate the status and role of the centrosome during differentiation and dedifferentiation in immortalized and primary murine myoblasts and in newt myoblasts, which are able to dedifferentiate and proliferate in response to muscle damage. To address the necessity and sufficiency of the candidate proteins, we will use genome engineering to generate conditionally stabilized and inducible variants of the proteins to manipulate functional centrosome loss during differentiation and to examine their effects on purified, functional centrosomes in an in vitro microtubule-organizing assay. The results of these investigations will identify novel pathways for the treatment of cancer."
"9223720","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  2 despite increasing reliance on away-from-home foods, grocery shopping continues to be the primary method 3 by which families obtain food and thus is an important determinant of their dietary intake and diet quality.  4 Grocery shopping occurs multiple times per week and even more frequently among certain ethnic groups (e.g., 5 Latinos), making it an important modifiable determinant to study for future intervention research. The proposed  6 study, In-store and parent-child influences on food shopping addresses three important sources of  7 influence on decision-making and purchasing behavior in food stores: in-store factors (e.g., how the products  8 are displayed on the shelves), parent-child interactional characteristics (e.g., parent-child communication and  9 parenting behaviors), and product factors (i.e., product healthfulness) during parent-child interactions 10 surrounding food and beverage product requests (N=150 dyads across two stores). This two-year, mixed- 11 methods study will use eye-tracking technology to identify aspects of the in-store environment that cue parents' 12 and children's purchase requests. The dyad will each wear eye-tracking glasses during a single grocery 13 shopping trip that capture visual and audio data for the entire shopping trip from both the parent's and the 14 child's perspectives. Parent interviews will capture household food shopping behavior, parenting behaviors, 15 and relevant cultural and economic factors. Our approach is innovative in its focus on identifying methods for 16 intervening on in-store and parent-child factors that influence parents' and children's purchase requests, 17 parenting behaviors, and parents' grocery shopping decision-making and purchasing behavior. The study is 18 significant given the focus on understanding three sources of influence on what consumers purchase (i.e., in- 19 store, parent-child and product factors), while focusing on a population (i.e., Latinos) that is disproportionately 20 affected by overweight and obesity, shops more frequently than the general population, is more likely to shop 21 with children, and frequently shops for food outside of supermarkets (in limited assortment food stores where 22 the proposed study will be conducted). The proposed study will extend our in-store environment research and 23 parent-child observational research to better understand in-store, parent-child, and product factors associated 24 with parents' and children's purchase requests and parenting behaviors, and how these relate to parent 25 grocery shopping decision-making and purchasing behavior. The long-term goal of this program of research is 26 to develop intervention strategies that recognize and address the multiple sources of influence on health 27 behaviors, including interpersonal and environmental influences. It is conceptually consistent with our larger 28 body of parenting research in family homes and in restaurants. By taking a mixed-methods approach to 29 studying distinct and modifiable sources of influence, this study will form the foundation for a future group 30 randomized controlled trial to examine intervention effects on dietary intake in children and parents."
"9321162","Abstract: As of 2014, an estimated 35 million persons worldwide were living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Early after primary infection, HIV enters the CNS and causes long lasting cognitive and motor impairment in 30-60 % of infected individuals, even in the current antiretroviral era. As infected individuals are living longer, the prevalence of neurological complications has been increasing. In the CNS, HIV infects mostly microglia/macrophages, but also a small population of astrocytes. However, despite the key roles of astrocytes in CNS functions, the role of these cells in NeuroAIDS has been relatively ignored. Our studies during the last funding period provide strong evidence for the critical role of astrocytes in the pathogenesis of NeuroAIDS. In particular, we have demonstrated that despite relatively low numbers of infected astrocytes and low to undetectable HIV replication, the HIV infected astrocytes transmit apoptotic and inflammatory signals, including calcium and inositol triphosphate (IP3), to neighboring uninfected cells, promoting neuronal damage and demise. We have also shown that these pro-apoptotic molecules are spread from the few HIV infected astrocytes via connexin-43 (Cx43) containing gap junctions (GJ) and unopposed hemichannels (uHC), whose expression and opening is regulated by HIV. Indeed, blocking GJ or uHC reduced amplification of bystander apoptosis, cellular dysfunction, synaptic compromise, and mitochondrial dysfunction induced by HIV infected astrocytes. Interestingly, HIV infected astrocytes themselves are protected from apoptosis by mechanisms that involve altered apoptosome formation and mitochondrial function. Importantly, we have tested and validated most of the mechanisms operating in HIV infected astrocytes in vivo in human and monkey brain tissue sections. Thus, based on the results obtained during the extremely productive period funded by our first R01 (resulting in over 40 publications in high quality peer reviewed journals) we have formulated our current hypothesis that ?HIV infected astrocytes survive HIV infection to become HIV reservoirs, and that these cells send toxic, pro-apoptotic signals to surrounding cells via Cx43 containing channels, leading to the CNS dysfunction and NeuroAIDS?. In this application we propose to characterize the novel pathways of HIV toxicity within the brain and to identify the role of GJ and uHC in CNS dysfunction. The results obtained from this proposal will lead to the identification of potential novel therapeutic targets to limit the devastating consequences of NeuroAIDS."
"9468462","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to understand the effects of ultrasound (US) on neural activity. US can modify action potential activity in neurons in vitro and in vivo without damaging neural tissue. This phenomenon can be applied in powerful new tools for basic and clinical neuroscience, with broad impact on public health issues related to mental and neurological disorders. To guide and hasten the development of these new tools, our research will provide insight into the physical, biophysical and neural mechanisms underlying US neurostimulation.  Our approach is unique in combining technology development with mechanistic studies of US neurostimulation at levels of complexity ranging from the single cell to the whole animal. Our prior and preliminary results suggest that US radiation force causes tissue displacement, resulting in cell membrane strain and thereby affecting neural activity through changes in ion channel activity or neurotransmitter exocytosis. We will investigate this hypothesis by combining US neurostimulation with EEG recording and radiation force imaging in rats, optical displacement measurements and multielectrode recording in the salamander and rat retina in vitro and in vivo, and electrophysiological measurements of ion channel activity and exocytosis in single HEK and PC12 cells. We will also test alternative hypotheses related to two other physical effects of US, cavitation and heating. To distinguish these mechanisms from radiation force we will examine the dependence of US neurostimulation on frequency and intensity. To facilitate these experiments, we will develop and implement new US devices, allowing US to be applied with multifocal and micron-scale resolution.  US neurostimulation is likely to have significant impact on public health. Brain stimulation therapies are used to treat Parkinson's disease, dystonia, and epilepsy and hold promise for many others. Compared to current brain stimulation techniques that rely on invasive implanted electrodes or have limited spatial resolution and depth penetration (e.g., transcranial magnetic stimulation), US offers an ideal combination of spatial resolution, depth penetration, and non-invasiveness. US neurostimlation can also be implemented in prosthetic devices; for example, to stimulate retinal circuitry to restore vision. In addition, US neurostimulation promises to become an enormously useful research tool in basic neuroscience, and is therefore relevant to all mental and neurological disorders of public health concern. However, all of these outcomes depend on the ability to apply US neurostimulation safely and with well-controlled, predictable results. Achieving this goal requires a detailed mechanistic understanding of US neurostimulation that our multidisciplinary research project will provide."
"9275831","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) are the core components of the highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), which has changed HIV infection from an invariably lethal to a manageable chronic condition. However, hepatic lipotoxicity, a process of hepatocellular dysfunction and injury induced by excess lipid accumulation, specifically associated with HIV PIs has become a major concern in the clinic, especially in patients who consume alcohol. Alcohol abuse, which is very common in HIV-1 infected patients, is one of the most important co-morbid risk factors for liver injury and has been associated with the occurrence of serious metabolic syndrome and subsequent discontinuation of HAART in HIV patients. Despite the prevalence of this problem, the cellular mechanisms by which alcohol exacerbates HAART- induced hepatic lipotoxicity remain to be identified.  Previous studies have identified that activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress represents an important mechanism underlying HIV PI-induced inflammation and hepatic lipotoxicity. It also has been reported that ER stress is a critical contributor to alcohol-induced  liver injury. Recent studies further indicate that activation of Kupffer cells (KCs), the resident liver macrophages, has a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of alcohol-induced inflammation and hepatic lipotoxicity. Alcohol-induced activation of the inflammasome in KCs is involved in hepatic inflammation, steatosis and injury. The inflammasome activates caspase-1, which cleaves pro-IL-1? into the bioactive IL-1?. IL-1? acts in an autocrine/paracrine manner through type I IL-1 receptor to activate inflammatory response. Reports show that the levels of proinflammatory cytokine, IL-1?, in patients with alcoholic liver disease (ALD) are increased. We hypothesize that alcohol promotes HIV PI-induced hepatic lipotoxicity by activating ER stress in hepatocytes and inflammasome in KCs, subsequently disrupting lipid homeostasis and inducing apoptosis in hepatocytes. We wish to define the role of ER stress in alcohol and HIV PI-induced hepatic lipotoxicity. Also, we will study the effect of alcohol and HIV PI on inflammasome activation in KCs. Finally, we intend to detail the impact of inflammasome activation in KCs on alcohol and HIV PI-induced hepatic lipotoxicity. We will approach our study with the following research aims: Specific Aim 1- To define the role of ER stress in alcohol- and HIV PI-induced hepatic lipotoxicity. Specific Aim 2- To examine the effect of alcohol and HIV PI on inflammasome activation in KCs. Specific Aim 3- To characterize the impact of inflammasome activation in KCs on alcohol and HIV PI-induced hepatic lipotoxicity."
"9278495","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Health inequalities in the United States are large and persistent, and begin early in life; infant mortality rates of children of African American mothers are more than twice that of children of white mothers. Research focused on the key individual, family, contextual, and policy-level strategies to improve the health of minority populations early in life is urgently needed. The Health Disparities Research Scholars Program is an interdisciplinary post-doctoral training program, located in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, designed to support the career development of health disparities researchers. The program has two primary goals: 1) to develop a cadre of biomedical, behavioral researchers who advance knowledge on the causes, consequences, and tools to reduce disparities in health among minority populations early in the life course; and 2) to attract and retain underrepresented minority investigators in academic research careers. To achieve the program goals, we actively recruit a diverse cadre of scholars who are committed to a career in health disparities research. We provide 2-3 years of training and support to scholars from doctorate programs ready to build on the methods of their graduate discipline, cross boundaries, and draw from content, theory and methods of other fields. We have assembled an exceptional core faculty with expertise across medical sciences, population health, social/behavioral, and basic sciences. There are five training components designed to achieve these objectives: a multidisciplinary mentor team; a weekly Health Disparities Research Scholars seminar and the opportunity to attend others on campus; coursework, workshops, and optional degree programs; mentored research, and professional development activities. Through this interdisciplinary training program we build key competencies and provide professional mentoring that facilitates the success of our scholars as independent health disparities researchers. Scholar activities are tracked through quarterly progress reports, biannual mentor team meetings, and an annual formal evaluation of each scholar. These assessments enable the program director and mentor team to provide timely guidance and identify strategies to ensure productivity and achievement of career goals."
"9485397","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Consistent findings across many studies demonstrate that maternal stress during pregnancy can have long-lasting effects on children's physical and neuropsychological development in a manner consistent with a programming mechanism. The biological mechanisms accounting for these associations remain uncertain, however. Particularly missing is human research that a) translates the sizable animal literature showing sex- dependent effects of prenatal stress and b) considers mechanisms underlying recent human findings linking prenatal maternal stress to sexually-dimorphic physical outcomes (anogenital distance) and neurodevelopmental disorders with significant sex differences (learning difficulties, autism). We propose a prospective longitudinal study starting in the first trimester to test the hypothesis that prenatal maternal stress may alter sex-dependent development in infancy by acting on fetal adrenal androgen pathways. We will do this by recruiting a cohort of 240 pregnant women, following them from the first trimester and regularly collecting behavioral and biological data until the child is 15 months of age using procedures for recruitment and retention successfully applied in prior cohort studies. The research design includes several important innovations in this growing field of study, including a) detailed data on stress hormones alongside sex steroid hormones sampled from multiple sources, b) intensive interrogation of placental structure and function using the protocols developed from the work with the National Children's Study (NCS); c) multiple assessments of infant physical and neuropsychological outcomes for which early emerging sex differences have been reliably documented. The specific aims of the project are to: 1) investigate maternal psychological stress and the stress hormone cortisol in relation to biomarkers of fetal and placental hormone activity, in each trimester of pregnancy; 2) identify evidence of prenatal stress-related alteratios in stress and sex steroid hormone pathways from the placenta and cord blood at birth using our established NCS protocols; 3) integrate maternal and placental biomarkers in predicting sex-dependent physical, neurocognitive, and social behavior measures at birth, 9 and 15 months. This line of research will complement and extend existing work by clarifying the biological mechanisms by which maternal stress is communicated to the fetus and improving our understanding of the etiology of sex differences in health and disease."
"9360173","The complement system is a critical part of innate immune responses that most animal viruses encounter during natural infections. Complement is an important factor in neutralization of many RNA viruses, but the role it plays in pathogenesis and dissemination during paramyxovirus infections is largely unknown. Here, we seek to fill gaps in our understanding of interactions of complement with the highly pathogenic paramyxovirus Nipah virus (NiV).  This project emerged from our recent published finding that NiV virions recruit complement Factor I as a novel mechanism to prevent neutralization, and that Factor I binds the NiV F protein on cell surfaces. These important findings raise the questions of: 1) what role NiV recruitment of this host cell inhibitor plays in blocking complement pathways at the cell surface and in preventing complement-mediated cell lysis, and 2) the role of complement in NiV infections of animals. Here, we will define mechanisms and functional consequences for NiV recruitment of Factor I to the cell surface (Aim 1) and the role of complement in either enhancing or restricting NiV tissue tropism and pathogenesis (Aim 2).  Our preliminary data have shown that Complement Factor I binds to the surface of cells expressing the NiV F protein but not the G protein. In Aim 1, we will use biochemical approaches and cell culture experiments to determine the requirements for F-mediated recruitment of Factor I. Functional assays will determine the effect of F protein-Factor I interactions on which complement pathways are activated at the cell surface and the extent of antibody-dependent and -independent cell lysis.  We hypothesize that complement pathways could act to inhibit NiV dissemination. Alternatively, complement could promote NiV dissemination and disease, especially given the importance of complement factors in lymphocyte recruitment and integrity of the blood brain barrier. In Aim 2, we will use a recently developed ferret model under BSL4 conditions to compare the course of NiV infection in the presence and absence of intact complement pathways. Time-course experiments will define the tissue-specific viral load (e.g., lung vs brain), changes in tissue pathological lesions and overall clinical outcomes.  There is intense interest in defining mechanisms that modulate the interplay between host innate immune systems, such as complement, and emerging paramyxoviruses with the potential for bioterrorism. By establishing the above key feasibility issues with this R21 Exploratory/Developmental grant mechanism, we will be in an excellent position for more advanced mechanistic studies using animal models."
"9333036","Major technological breakthroughs in biology reveal new dimensions in our understanding of gene regulation and chromatin 3-D structure. At the heart of understanding gene regulation are studies of transcription-regulating, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that are transcribed from enhancers. While the concept that lncRNAs play genome-wide roles as transcriptional regulators is now accepted, the relationship between lncRNAs and chromatin 3-D structure is still unclear. Therefore, a central question in biology remains: How do lncRNAs interact with chromatin to establish gene regulatory networks in the context of chromatin 3-D structure?  By using a combination of large-scale analyses, including next-generation nucleic-acid sequencing, mass spectrometry protein sequencing, genome-wide chromosome conformation, and bioinformatics, we can now investigate the relationship between epigenetic factors, gene regulation, and chromatin 3-D structure.  For over a decade, my lab has been studying transcriptional regulation by Evf2, the first enhancer-regulating, ultraconserved lncRNA (Feng et al. 2006, Bond et al. 2009, Berghoff et al. 2013, Cajigas et al. 2015). Collectively, these studies establish some fundamental principles regarding the role of lncRNAs in gene regulation, including the finding that a single developmentally regulated lncRNA controls GABAergic interneuron development and adult brain circuitry (Bond et al. 2009). Our previous work focused on Evf2 regulation of adjacent or overlapping, Dlx5/6 intergenic enhancers, and reported short-range effects on gene expression, transcription factor recruitment, histone modifications, site-specific CpG DNA methylation, and direct inhibition of ATPase and chromatin remodeling activities (Bond et al. 2009, Berghoff et al. 2013, Cajigas et al. 2015).  In this proposal, we will combine the genetic and biochemical tools developed in my lab over the past decade, with recent large-scale technologies, to determine the relationship between the Evf2 gene regulatory network and chromatin 3-D structure."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The National Bureau of Economic Research is a consortium of economic scholars from major research universities throughout the United States and abroad. We established an NRSA institutional training program on the economics of aging in 1989 as an integral component of our larger research and training activities on aging. Since its inception, the T32 program has supported about 140 trainees, the large majority of whom have developed a long-term research agenda on the economics of aging. Many of our former trainees have become prominent economic scholars, and many are engaged currently as investigators on NIA-funded grants. Together, they have elevated the economics of aging and health as an established and popular subfield of economics research. This application proposes a five year continuation of this program. Funds are requested to support eight pre-doctoral fellows and three post-doctoral fellows per year. Each will develop an intensive research agenda on one or more issues related to aging and health. Fellows will also become active participants in the NBER's larger program on the economics of aging, which involves roughly a hundred university-based scholars working on collaborative projects covering a wide range of issues in aging, health, and the wellbeing of the elderly. Indeed a major asset of the program is the research environment at the NBER, where there are extensive opportunities for interaction and collaboration among investigators at all levels of seniority. The continuation of the program will provide a strong background in aging-related research to a new generation of emerging scholars in economics, most of whom will use their fellowship research as the foundation of a long-term research agenda on issues in aging and health."
"9299186","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of heritable red blood cell disorders that primarily affect individuals who identify as Black or African-American. Other affected groups include those of Hispanic, southern European, Middle Eastern, and Asian Indian descent. The hallmark of SCD is the painful vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), which is still not well understood or managed. This may result in delays in treatment, undertreatment, and unnecessary suffering. Because SCD primarily affects African-Americans and other minority groups, mistrust between patients and providers may put patients with SCD at increased risk of healthcare disparities, including reduced access to necessary pain management. For most patients, pain is managed at home, further contributing to underestimation by healthcare practitioners of the prevalence and impact of SCD pain. However, when patients in VOC present acutely, they have usually exhausted home care and outpatient therapies, thereby signaling the need for parenteral opioids. Using a retrospective cohort of 150 patients with SCD hospitalized at one urban academic medical center, the overall goal of this study is to develop methodology to characterize the sickle cell pain trajectory. Specifically, the aims are to (1) use latent class analysis to identify different patterns of pain trajectories during hospitalizations for sickle cell pain crisis and determine socio-demographic and clinical factors associated with the different pain trajectories; (2) describe the relationship between treatment management strategies and sickle cell pain scores during hospitalization; and (3) assess the relationship between different patterns of sickle cell pain trajectories and future readmission for sickle cell pain crisis. Results from the proposed study can then be used to develop prospective studies to better measure pain during hospitalizations or to identify factors that affect the pain trajectory, which can be used to target interventions or pain management approaches. In addition, better characterization of the pain trajectory and treatment of pain in SCD are especially urgent as efforts are made nationally to restrict access to opioids given the current crisis of abuse, addiction, and overdose. Patients experiencing severe and devastating pain, such as those with SCD, should not be made to suffer because they are denied necessary treatment."
"9284517","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The wealth of information provided by whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing studies can make it difficult to identify variants that cause disease. Family sequencing, in particular the sequencing of trios and quartets with affected children and unaffected parents, allows one to exclude most of the rare variants present in the genome and focus on those few that are de novo or rare and homozygous only in the offspring. There is growing recognition that this is a productive approach in the study of complex diseases. Here, we propose to perform whole exome sequencing in families to identify genetic variants predisposing to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). OCD is among the 10 most disabling medical conditions worldwide and involves persistent, intrusive, senseless thoughts and impulses (obsessions) and repetitive, intentional behaviors (compulsions). The lifetime prevalence of OCD is estimated at 1-3%. Although medication and behavioral therapy, available since the late 1980s, are useful, they control symptoms with only limited success, and the course of the condition remains chronic in most cases; cure is rare. It is therefore critical to understand the pathophysiology of OCD so we can ultimately develop effective treatments. We propose to sequence the exomes of 375 simplex OCD trios and 100 OCD quartets comprising affected sibs and unaffected parents. In the trios, we will identify de novo variants that are annotated as functional. Even if de novo variants are found to explain only a small proportion of OCD cases, their discovery will provide a substantial advance in understanding the pathophysiology of the disorder. Furthermore, we will analyze the distribution of de novo variants found in the trios, comparing this distribution to that expected in the general population and that found in trios from other psychiatric diseases. In the quartets as well as the trios, we will identify causal variants that are homozygous or compound heterozygous in the offspring but heterozygous in the parents. We will identify candidate variants falling into these categories and will prioritize them based upon functional annotation, rarity and overlap of implicated genes between unrelated families. We will then confirm these variants by genotyping them in unaffected family members. Finally, we will identify genotype-phenotype correlations by looking for characteristics that are shared between unrelated cases with causal variants in the same gene and also by looking for genetic similarities within clearly defined clinical subgroups of patients, such as those with tic disorders."
"9329023","Abstract/Project Summary: Influenza virus is a major health burden, hospitalizing 200,000, and resulting in 36,000 deaths per year in the United States. Seasonal influenza infection is driven largely by antigenic shift to avoid established antibody responses. Thus, there is a need to create a broadly reactive T cell-based vaccine that recognizes highly conserved internal epitopes, thereby reducing the need for seasonal vaccination. However, the efficacy of cellular immunity to influenza viruses has been shown to wane over time. Lung tissue resident memory T cells (lung TRM) have been found to be important in a protective heterosubtypic response to influenza, and our preliminary data suggests that gradual decay of lung TRM cell numbers over time are responsible for the loss of cellular immunity to influenza viruses. This project will use a mouse model of influenza infection to examine the loss of subsets of influenza-specific lung CD8 TRM and how this decline is mediated by pro-apoptotic signaling triggered by localized inflammation. This will be accomplished using both respiratory and systemic pathogens to determine if the loss of TRM is specific to the lung or specific to respiratory pathogens. Secondary infections with unrelated pathogens or TLR agonists will be used to examine cell death pathways that drive loss of pre- existing flu-specific TRM. The overall goal of this project is to understand the mechanisms driving the loss of influenza-specific TRM from the lung environment. The knowledge gained in this study will guide future vaccine design against respiratory pathogens by understanding the mechanisms that lead to loss of lung TRM populations, and how localized inflammation affects pre-existing immunity in the lung.                        "
"9302579","ABSTRACT  Monkey B virus (BV) is a herpesvirus common in macaque (rhesus, cynomolgus) monkeys which are an invaluable resource for biomedical research. When BV is transmitted to humans, ~80% of patients die and survivors frequently experience progressive neurological decline, making BV the single greatest zoonotic danger facing research and veterinary personnel who work with macaques. Drugs currently used to treat BV infections were developed for treatment of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections, and are all are less effective against BV than HSV. Even when treated with ganciclovir (GCV), the most effective drug, some BV patients still die. Studies in mice also suggest that the current recommended treatment protocol may be flawed, allowing undetected BV infections to invade the central nervous system, resulting in a drastically diminished chance of patient survival. Since new drugs specifically targeted at BV are unlikely to be developed due to a lack of financial incentive, therapy using existing antivirals needs to be optimized. In the proposed study drugs shown to be effective against HSV and some experimental drugs will be tested for in vivo efficacy against BV by systemic administration using a mouse model. Preliminary experiments indicate that drugs applied topically can provide protection against BV that is as effective as systemically administered drugs. In addition, cidofovir (CDV) appears to be more effective against BV than GCV (the most effective drug currently recommended for treatment of BV infections) and an experimental drug having a different mode of action than GCV or CDV is also effective against BV, raising the possibility of its use in a dual drug regimen for added treatment efficacy. These results need to be followed up with additional research to validate use of topical drug delivery as a means of preventing neurological BV infections, use of CDV to treat BV infections, and the potential efficacy of dual drug regimens. This project will produce the needed confirmatory data and test the efficacy of dual drug regimens. The results will serve as a rational scientific basis for possible modification of existing recommendations for treatment of zoonotic BV infections."
"9266685","The overall goal of this project Is to understand the contribution of microtubules (MTs) to viral infectivity. MTs  exist in dynamic and stabilized states. Upon stabilization, tubulin subunits comprising MTs become post-  translationally modified (PTM). While both dynamic and stable MTs may play roles in viral infection, stable,  PTM MTs may be particularly important. Viral proteins bind MT stabilizing factors, host cell factors critical for  viral infectivity affect levels of stable MTs in cells and some viruses even enhance the formation of stable,  PTM MTs in cell they infect. While we understand a number of the factors involved in MT stabilization  pathways in cells, we have relatively little understanding of the relationship between viral infectivity and the  functions that stable, PTM MTs provide during viral infection. In this project, we pursue three aims to  enhance our understanding of the relationship between MT stability, tubulin PTMs and viral infectivity. We  will conduct a screen for new factors involved in MT stability and viral infectivity by examining a family of MT  interacting proteins implicated in MT stability. We will critically test the relationship between viral infectivity,  tubulin PTMs, and MT stability, by developing strategies to generate cells lacking or overexpressing the two  PTMs of tubulin that commonly occur in stable MTs of cells infected by viruses. And, we will examine the  spatial relationships between viruses and different classes of MTs by developing new methods to image  stable and PTM MTs in living ceils infected with fluorescent viruses and by testing the motility of viral motors  on PTM MTs. These aims will be conducted in collaboration with the Goff, Naghavi, Walsh and Vallee  groups. The results of these studies will provide new mechanistic information into how different classes of  MTs contribute to viral infection and will provide new insights into how viruses manipulate and take  advantage of host cell factors to augment their infection. These studies will also identify new host cell factors  that influence viral infection and hence have important implications forthe development of anti-viral and viral-  based gene targeting strategies."
"9322082","The mission of the Pilot and Feasibility (P&F) Program of the Penn DRC is to foster the development of new investigators and to provide seed support for innovative high-risk diabetes related projects, with an increasing emphasis on clinical and translational science. Over the past 2 funding periods (10 years), the Pilot and Feasibility Program has been highly successful in this regard. 46 investigators received P&F awards and, of these, 83% have garnered independent NIH support, the majority as R01s directly related to their P&F awards. During the previous funding period 28 traditional P&F grants were awarded among 89 applications submitted by investigators representing 27 Departments spanning multiple Schools and Institutes on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania as well as other Philadelphia Institutions. Of the funded grants, 80% were to new investigators and more than 15% were dedicated to clinical and translational projects. During the next funding period we propose to continue this core mission of the Pilot and Feasibility Program. Given the past successes of the program, the increasing cost of performing research in the setting of an ever more competitive general funding environment, and the clear need based on the steady influx of applications from both within and outside the diabetes research community, it is critical to continue the mission of the P&F Program."
"9280004","TR&D 2 - Field-cycling relaxometry Summary The ?Center on Macromolecular Dynamics by NMR Spectroscopy? (CoMD/NMR) will install the world's first field-cycling shuttle system for an 800 MHz NMR spectrometer, to be sited at the New York Structural Biology Center. This instrument will enable applications of relaxometry to DBPs, to significantly increase knowledge of the relevant spectral density functions and therefore allow much more detailed investigations of macromolecular conformational dynamics. Relaxometry is a technique in which a sample is polarized at high static magnetic field, then physically moved to low field for a relaxation period, and subsequently returned to high field for detection. Activities in this TR&D will include evaluation of alternative shuttle designs, development of novel experimental strategies for use of the shuttle probe, and iterative development and validation of analysis approaches to interpret relaxometric data for the DBPs."
"9374370","SUMMARY  Neutrophil influx into the intestinal lumen is critical in the response to infectious agents, but is also associated with intestinal damage observed in idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Our prior studies have shown that this influx is mediated by the chemoattractant actions of hepoxilin A3 (HXA3) secreted from the luminal surface of epithelial cells by the efflux pump MRP2. Preliminary studies herein provide evidence that epithelial cells export another class of bioactive lipids from their apical surface, N-acyl ethanolamine class endocannabinoids via the multidrug resistance transporter P- glycoprotein (P-gp), which counteract this inflammatory response. Loss of endocannabinoid signaling through CB2, the peripheral cannabinoid receptor, leads to increased pathology and neutrophil influx during acute intestinal inflammation, consistent with events of IBD. Such preliminary data underscore a key role for epithelial cells in balancing the secretion of pro- and anti-inflammatory lipids via surface efflux pumps in order to control neutrophil infiltration and maintain homeostasis in the healthy intestine. Thus, we have identified a new layer of regulation of neutrophil function in the intestine. Unlike other anti- inflammatory lipids, such as the specialized pro-resolving mediators that are produced by immune cells, we have discovered that epithelial cells constitutively produce and apically secrete endocannabinoids, which we refer to as AMEND (activity modulating epithelial-neutrophil discourse), to locally establish an anti-inflammatory environment to maintain intestinal homeostasis. Thus, it appears that there are two systems, an anti-inflammatory P-gp secretion of endocannabinoids pathway and a pro-inflammatory MRP2 secretion of HxA3 pathway, that function in a balanced and coordinated manner that can be used by epithelial cells to integrate signals from the local environment to maintain exquisite control over the initiation of intestinal inflammation. We seek to further understand the interaction between HXA3 and neutrophils, and to investigate the mechanisms by which AMEND regulates HXA3 activity during homeostasis and disease. Bridging this gap could help explain how commensal bacteria can stabilize a state of tolerance and how genetic variations in specific elements of either pathway might predispose individuals to development of IBD. To address these questions, we will determine whether P-gp/AMEND and MRP2/HXA3 pathways modulate the balance between microbial tolerance and inflammatory responses, and that disturbance of this balance leads to pathological inflammation. Thus, Aim 1 is designed to assess the imbalance between the Pgp/EC and MRP2/HXA3 pathways in patients who suffer from ulcerative colitis, and Aim 2 will examine whether dysbiotic vs. healthy human stool differentially modulates the P-gp and MRP pathways in the intestine."
"9253759","Project Summary  Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, affecting roughly 5.5 million Americans, and is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. Quantification of amyloid (A?) plaque burden with 18F and 11C- based Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging agents, based on high affinity A? aggregate-binding radionuclides shows promise for identifying individuals with increased risk of progressing to AD. However, PET imaging has several drawbacks including high cost, limited access, and poor spatial resolution. Furthermore, PET involves radiochemistry, which is both expensive and complex, thereby limiting distribution potential to specialized medical centers with radiochemistry capabilities.  This Phase II project will seek to further develop ?ADx-Magnetic Resonance(MR)?, a targeted liposomal contrast agent that will be used in conjunction with 1.5T MR imaging systems, which are far more readily available than PET imaging systems, and much less expensive to use. The primary objectives of this Phase II grant is to gather safety/pharmacokinetic data in both small and large animals, and to transfer the synthesis process to a contract manufacturer in preparation for future GLP studies.  ADx-MR has the potential to provide imaging of AD pathology at high resolution, and a significantly lower cost, with 5-10x more patient access points, than PET amyloid imaging. Coupled with the exceptional spatial resolution of MR Imaging, this agent enables the visualization of features at a voxel size of 100 µm, a significant improvement over PET approaches with centimeter size voxels.  To date, this novel, intravenously delivered A?-targeted liposome, ADx, has proven successful in in-vivo studies in three Alzheimer's mouse models. Alzeca has also performed dose ranging studies in mice and pilot PK studies in non-human primates. The goal of this project is therefore to advance ADx-MR, a liposomal T1-MR agent to qualify for a pre-IND meeting by establishing additional efficacy, safety, and scalability data."
"9313748","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common and increases mortality. AKI complicates up to 20% of hospital admissions and 30 to 50% of ICU admissions. Sepsis occurs in 40-45% of patients after AKI diagnosis and doubles mortality. Pneumonia is the most common cause of sepsis and infection-related death in hospitalized patients. Mortality in pneumonia doubles when patients become bacteremic. Since the vast majority of patients with bacteremia are septic, bacteremia may be considered equivalent to sepsis. In this grant, we investigate the mechanisms by which AKI predisposes to bacteremia and sepsis from pneumonia. The mechanism by which pneumonia causes bacteremia is poorly understood and is generally considered to be due to immunosuppression leading to overwhelming of lung bacterial defenses. In preliminary studies, we found that mice with AKI had similar pneumonia severity to controls with pneumonia, yet bacteremia was greater in AKI. Thus, immunosuppression does not explain bacteremia during AKI. In fact, rather than an immunosuppressed response, our preliminary studies demonstrate that the response to endotoxin (the immune activating component of gram negative bacteria) was exuberant and characterized by an increased inflammatory response. Claudin 4, a lung epithelial tight junction protein, was reduced suggesting that increased epithelial permeability was present in AKI with pneumonia. Thus, we suggest that AKI causes immune priming, not immunosuppression, of the lung. Preliminary studies suggest the lung immune priming in AKI coincides with lung neutrophil recruitment. Our overall hypothesis is that AKI primes the lung to exert an exuberant inflammatory response when exposed to endotoxin or pneumonia from gram negative bacteria. We propose that the exuberant inflammatory response mediates lung inflammation, loss of tight junction proteins (e.g., claudin 4), and increased epithelial permeability which facilitates translocation of bacteria into the circulation resulting in bacteremia and sepsis. We have three Specific Aims: 1) Determine if AKI causes lung immune priming, 2) Determine if bacterial translocation is greater in AKI with pneumonia, 3 Determine if loss of claudin 4 mediates bacterial translocation in AKI with pneumonia. In Aim 1, we seek to characterize the immune primed response, determine if this response is specific to alveolar macrophages, and identify factors in AKI which lead to immune priming (i.e., neutrophil recruitment and dialyzable circulating factors (using peritoneal dialysis). In Aim 2, we seek to establish that increased translocation of bacteria explains bacteremia in AKI using intravital confocal microscopy to track and quantify translocation of GFP-labelled bacteria in live mice with pneumonia and AKI. In Aim three, we seek to establish that the inflammatory response of AKI-primed alveolar macrophages mediates bacteremia during pneumonia by down regulating claudin 4 expression and increasing lung epithelial permeability. The experiments in this grant will provide useful leads into the development of interventions to prevent sepsis from pneumonia and improve survival in patients with AKI."
"9464008","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV latency is emerging as barrier to eradicating HIV-1 infection. The current theoretical paradigm for eliminating the viral reservoir is known as `Shock and Kill', reactivation of latent virus using non-targeted small molecules. However, significant hurdles will have to be overcome for this approach to be successful. These include stochastic viral reactivation, avoidance of global T-cell activation, and limited cellular death upn re- activation. In addition to these limitations, most of what we know about latency is derived from the study of latency in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Using a newly developed dual fluorescence reporter HIV, we have observed that latency was significantly more prevalent in CD4 T cells isolated from oral lymphoid tissues (tonsil) than in CD4 T cells from peripheral blood or spleen. In addition, latency in CD4 T cells from oral lymphoid tissues was strongly dependent on the presence of non-CD4 T cells. Thus, the biology of latency and its reactivation may differ in primary oral lymphoid tissues when compared to other lymphoid tissues. If so, therapeutic interventions might need to be modified to account for the unique characteristics of latency in oral lymphoid tissues. We propose to use a multi-pronged, systems-biology strategy to further define HIV latency and its mechanism in primary oral lymphoid tissues. We will use our new HIV-1 reporter to identify, quantify, and purify latently infected cells in their native state earl after infection of tonsil CD4 T cells. Purified latently infected cells will be characterized usingthe following tools: 1. CyTOF single-cell analysis of cell-surface markers, T-cell signaling networks, and T-cell effector function; 2. RNAseq and microRNAseq analysis of the cellular transcriptome; 3. Mechanistic studies using RNP-Cas9 gene interference to identify key regulators of HIV latency in primary oral lymphoid tissues. In addition, we will define the relative contribution of intercellular interactions and secreted factors in the ability of non-CD4 T cells to influence HIV latency in CD4 T cells in oral lymphoid tissues. By combining our dual-fluorescence latency model with powerful systems biology techniques and the tonsil HLAC system, we expect to significantly increase our understanding of HIV latency and to identify potential new therapeutic opportunities."
"9319775","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to develop and implement a process for involving potential participants in H3Africa biobanking research at Tygerberg Hospital in the development of governance policies for the H3Africa biorepository, and to translate that process into a generalizable guideline for other H3Africa sites. It will be done ove two parts. Part 1 will aim to obtain key stakeholder views on a community engagement (CE) guideline to inform biobanking governance. This aim will first develop an educational tool which will be used for discussions on biobanking throughout the H3Africa network. Using this tool, we will conduct semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders to ascertain their views on how best to involve the wider Tygerberg community in the governance process. Key themes will then emerge from these interviews which will underpin our approach to developing a CE process for the wider Tygerberg community. In Part 2 of this project, we will develop the CE process which is informed by the themes which emerged from the interviews, by the best policy work on CE guidance for genomic research internationally. empirical studies of CE guidance for other forms of biomedical research in Africa (such as HIV research), the existing literature on indicators for monitoring and evaluating CE and the limited experience to date with CE for genomic biobanking research in different African settings. Importantly, it will also be informed by the principle of Ubuntu, which is a component of African philosophy. The results of these research activities will be tempered with the key principles identified in our local interviews and translatd into a model CE process that can provide practical guidance for other H3Africa efforts."
"9347881","Despite the introduction of new anti-multiple myeloma (MM) treatment regimens, such as Bortezomib (a top 10 best- selling cancer drug), high MM relapse rates and drug resistance as well as problematic neuropathy and thrombocytopenia side effects continue to plague the current therapies. Furthermore, ~30% MM patients never respond to Bortezomib treatment. Particularly, osteolytic bone diseases and renal failure resulting from hyperparaproteinemia and hypercalcemia have been the major serious sequelae that are inextricably linked with MM tumor progression. So far, MM disease remains the second most common hematological malignancy in the U.S. and incurable with a median survival of 3 to 5 years. Thus, novel MM drug targets and new small-molecule probes are in critical need both to understand the disease-associated pathways and to facilitate anti-MM drug discovery. This Fast Track proposal seeks support for acceleration of FDA IND-enabling preclinical evaluations of the developed high-efficacy/low-toxicity small-molecules, targeting the protein p62 (sequestosome 1, SQSTM1), so called p62ZZ inhibitors. The scientific basis for p62ZZ inhibitors as a novel anti-MM pharmacotherapy includes: i) the innovative discovery of first p62-ZZ antagonist small-molecules, exhibiting significant inhibition of human MM cell growth as reported in our recent publications and patents; ii) the solid experimental confirmation of p62-target specificity, revealing that down regulation or deletion of p62 in marrow stromal cells significantly decreased expression levels of PKC?, VCAM-1, TNF-? and IL-6, and also decreased the stromal cell support of MM cell growth; iii) the strong experimental verification, showing that ZZ domain of p62 is specifically required for stromal cell support of MM cell growth and osteoclast activation through atypical PKC, NF-?B, MAPK and IL-6 production; iv) the discovered p62-ZZ small-molecule inhibitors demonstrated promising drug PK/PD bioavailability and low toxicity profiles, and can significantly inhibit MM tumor growth (>75%) compared with the control group in in vivo human MM xenograft murine model; and v) p62-ZZ small-molecules induce dramatic new bone formation selectively in MM-containing bones in an immunocompetent mouse model. Thus, the goal of the NIH Fast Track is to carry out IND-enabling preclinical research and development work to advance the discovered/reported small- molecule drug candidates to the next stage for undertaking scale-up chemistry synthesis and IND-enabling toxicology and efficacy investigations. Bringing drug candidates to the defined milestones will fast-track commercialization opportunities via co-development partnerships with major pharma/biotech companies and also significantly enhance the chances of attracting additional private financial investments, leading ultimately to multiple myeloma disease drug clinical trials."

The unique challenges associated with the acquisition and interpretation of such data has  meant that new strategies are required for reconstruction, quantitative analysis and integration with other  imaging modalities. There are currently no commercial packages available to meet these needs. The  dissemination of new methodologies and applications being investigated by TR&D1 and TR&D2 is critically  dependent upon having a rapid feedback between theoretical concept, experiment and interpretation of results.  The progress that TR&D3 has made in the last three years in satisfying these requirements has been a major  factor in meeting the needs of the Research, Collaborative and Service Projects. The SIVIC package and new,  custom designed capabilities have been disseminated through one-on-one interactions, in highly successful,  hands-on sessions at the HMTRC workshops and using the comprehensive on-line portal. In translating the  hyperpolarized C-13 technology from in vitro to pre-clinical and human studies, we have identified several  areas where new approaches would have a major impact for our users. In the next funding cycle we propose to  accelerate the pace of discovery and translation in three main areas:  Aim 1: To expand and enhance the capabilities of the SIVIC software package to support development,  analysis and validation of the new data acquisition strategies being developed in TR&D1 and TR&D2.  Aim 2: To develop new algorithms and pipelines for analyzing hyperpolarized MR data for applications that are  being driven by investigators in the Collaborative and Service Projects.  Aim 3: To disseminate, support and provide ongoing refinements for software tools, analysis methods and  novel algorithms being developed in SIVIC for interpretation of hyperpolarized MR data for the Research,  Collaborative and Service Projects, as well as the broader research community."
"9345798","PROJECT SUMMARY Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a debilitating complication that can arise from use of a number of chemotherapeutics, and which limits both the dose and duration of cancer treatments with these agents. Up to 40% of cancer patients treated with chemotherapy describe some form of CIPN, with sensory neuropathy being dominant. Symptoms vary from tingling and numbness indicative of sensory loss to aspects of painful neuropathy such as allodynia and spontaneous shooting pains. The American Society of Clinical Oncology makes no recommendations for the prevention of CIPN and provides only a moderate recommendation for treatment with duloxetine, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor for symptomatic relief of pain. WinSanTor?s founders have uncovered a new homeostatic mechanism in sensory neurons that constrains mitochondrial function, which can be exploited to improve energy supply to reverse and to prevent nerve damage in CIPN. We have demonstrated that the muscarinic acetylcholine type 1 receptor (M1R) signaling limits mitochondrial activity and that antagonizing M1R increases the overall respiratory capacity of mitochondria. Additionally, we have observed that the M1R antagonist pirenzepine can prevent the neuropathy induced by chemotherapeutic agents. The goal of this Phase I STTR project is to assess the therapeutic potential of pirenzepine as a CIPN intervention that enhances neuronal AMPK activity and restores neuronal energy capacity to prevent or reverse neuropathy without impeding the chemotherapeutic microtubule-stabilizing properties of paclitaxel. To this end our Specific Aims are: Specific Aim 1. Assess the tumoricidal activity of paclitaxel in presence of pirenzepine. Specific Aim 2. Test efficacy of pirenzepine in mouse paclitaxel models of CIPN. The studies proposed herein will advance further pre-clinical development of pirenzepine as a potentially first- in-class therapy for preventing and/or reversing CIPN."
"9270601","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project focuses on the role of signal transduction mechanisms in hippocampal neuronal plasticity and memory formation. In the most recent Project Period we have been exploring the role of the TET Dioxygenase family of signal transduction cascades in hippocampal neuronal plasticity and learning, focusing on the mechanisms through which this pathway controls memory-associated gene transcription. We initiated our studies in this area about 10 years ago by determining that epigenetic mechanisms including histone acetylation and DNA Methyltransferase activity are necessary for NMDA receptor-dependent LTP in area CA1. We then transitioned to studies in the behaving animal and discovered that epigenetic mechanisms are activated in the hippocampus with contextual associative conditioning, and that alterations in epigenetic mechanisms are necessary for fear conditioning and for spatial learning. Studies from a wide variety of laboratories have now shown that epigenetic signaling is involved in many forms of synaptic plasticity and learning, in essentially every species that has so far been examined including humans. Moreover, in the last Project Period, we as well as the Tsai lab discovered that TET1 Oxygenase is a controller of active DNA demethylation in the CNS, and that this pathway regulates memory capacity in the behaving animal. Given the clear importance of understanding the roles and regulation of TET Oxygenase-dependent epigenetic mechanisms in neural plasticity and learning, for the next Project Period we propose to continue our investigations into the genomic, epigenomic, and functional targets of TET Oxygenase regulation in the hippocampus. We will pursue the following three Specific Aims: 1: To test the hypothesis that TET1 drives active demethylation at memory-associated genes. 2: To test the prediction that site-specific gene demethylation is sufficient to alter gene expression and regulate memory formation. 3: To test the specific hypothesis that TET1 regulates memory capacity via controlling homeostatic synaptic plasticity and cell-wide excitability in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. By focusing on these important new targets for the TET Oxygenase pathway in hippocampus, we will continue to formulate a comprehensive model of epigenetic regulation of transcription-dependent molecular mechanisms in neuronal plasticity and memory."

Specialized training in this new field of hyperpolarized carbon-13 MRI is required since it is still quite new and  very different from conventional MRI and from other molecular imaging techniques. Training and dissemination  through the Hyperpolarized MRI Technology Resource Center has been a major focus and highly successful  over the past 4 years. In this renewal application, we will continue to utilize the unique instrumentation and  personnel of this Biomedical Technology Resource Center to provide unprecedented training in this metabolic  imaging technique. The website will continue to be a critical tool for the center to disseminate information on  the BTRC's goals, accomplishments, open-source software, research data, how to establish Collaborative and  Service Projects, recent news, and with links to other related NIH funded P41 centers and the NIBIB BTRC  program web page. Also, there will be a major focus on the timely reporting of techniques and results  generated by the BTRC through conference presentations and peer-reviewed journal articles (acknowledging  NIH support of the HMTRC). Training will continue to be focused in the areas of polarizer instrumentation &  operation, hyperpolarized agent preparation, optimizing 13C MRI acquisitions, and reconstruction/analysis  using the 13C-SIVIC open-source software package. Since the establishment of HMTRC, the center has held  two hands-on training workshops attracting 85 and 120 participants respectively from across the US, Canada,  Europe and Asia; providing hands-on demonstrations, training and technology dissemination in DNP polarizer  operation, MR sequence and acquisition methods, bioreactors, animals preps and analysis software. While the  center is currently focused on preclinical studies, we will add presentations on clinical translation to enable new  discussions/dissemination of the technical steps necessary for clinical trial studies of this HP carbon-13 MR.  From TR&D1 research and development, diagrams and construction documentation of the DNP  instrumentation and MR hardware developed through this project will be made available online on the HMTRC  website as well as the high field MR sequences and imaging protocols. The ultimate goal of TR&D2 is the  dissemination of the new NMR compatible cell and tissue culture bioreactor systems optimized for specific cell  and tissue types, novel hyperpolarized probe preparations and methods, and the training of the biomedical  community on the use of these new pre-clinical models, probes and techniques. TR&D3 will develop free open-  source, DICOM compliant, cross-platform software tools for reconstruction, quantification and visualization of  hyperpolarized MR data as driven by the needs of the Collaborative Projects. There are currently no other  packages available for analysis of the results obtained using the fast imaging and spectroscopy pulse  sequences associated with this new in vivo technology."
"9250214","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that intranasal (IN) OT modulates social cognitive processes and behaviors in humans, including increasing gaze to eye regions of others, enhancing the ability to infer the emotions of others, and increasing face recognition memory, and socially reinforced learning. These findings are remarkably consistent with rodent studies showing that OT facilitates social recognition and the formation of social bonds. The overarching hypothesis of this Conte Center application is that OT acts in animals and human subjects to increase the salience and reinforcing value of social stimuli. These findings and our overarching hypothesis have tremendous implications for the development of novel therapies for improving social function in psychiatric disorders characterized by impaired social cognition, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia. Indeed, IN-OT enhances some aspects of social functioning in patients with ASD, including increased eye-contact, improved emotion recognition and adaptive cooperation. Despite the remarkable interest in IN-OT, very little is known regarding the psychological and neural mechanisms by which OT affects social functioning in humans. We hypothesize the reported effects of INOT on complex social cognition in humans reflects an impact on the more fundamental processes of salience and reinforcing value of social stimuli. Further we hypothesize that these effects are mediated by increased activation and functional connectivity between brain regions involved in social cue perception (e.g. amygdala) and reward (e.g. ventral striatum). We will test this hypothesis using a combined approach of social cognitive tests and functional MRI (fMRI) with IN-OT administration in healthy and ASD human subjects. We hypothesize that ASD subjects will show decreased attention to social cue and decreased responses to social reinforcers than healthy subjects. The differences will be associated with differences in neural activity and connectivity. Finally IN-OT will normalize behavioral responses and neural activity in ASD subjects. If our predictions are correct, these data will have important implications for combining IN-OT and behavioral therapies to improve social function in psychiatric disorders."

The success of the first three years of the IHSFC is demonstrated by research consultation and targeted and untargeted exposure analyses supporting 65 HERCULES investigators. The mission of the IHSFC is to facilitate translation and integration of basic science research on environmental exposures into population and precision medicine applications. In this, the IHSFC works to enhance research and community partnerships through the Georgia CTSA, the Community Outreach and Engagement Core (COEC) and presentations to non-scientific audiences. The Core emphasizes the impact of exposures on complex biological systems that change dynamically over time. This mission is driven by the overall theme of HERCULES to use exposome-based concepts and approaches to improve human health. A key aspect of the IHSFC is to operationalize exposome-related research and is primarily designed to provide access to tools and research approaches for clinical and epidemiology research in environmental health. The IHSFC leadership (Jones, Barr, Ziegler, Vos, Marsit) is active in workshops, symposia, and society activities promoting development of exposome-related research. The IHSFC work closely with 1) the Environmental Health Data Science Core to enhance utilization and development of exposome-related tools, 2) the Administrative Core to enhance training opportunities in key exposure science technologies and environmental health approaches, 3) the COEC to enhance global understanding of the exposome-related concepts and research and their importance in human health and environmental sustainability, and 4) the Pilot Project Program to facilitate translation and integration of exposome-related research tools and concepts into novel and competitive new research projects. The Core leaders have established local, national and international research leadership in exposure science, quantitative biology and clinical and translational research, are active in development of exposome-related research and are well- positioned to continue leadership to enhance and facilitate the NIEHS mission in environmental health."
"9387219","Sequence to activity relationship (SAR) mapping is essential to almost all efforts seeking to identify biological mechanisms1?10. Even though considerable advances have occurred, SAR mapping methods remain slow, laborious, and limited to scales that are not readily extended beyond a single loci. Such limitations are significant in the context of target identification, small molecule screening, protein therapeutics, therapeutic production, and antimicrobial resistance, among others. We have spent the last decade focused on the development of SAR mapping technologies that address these limitations5,6,11. Most recently we have developed a breakthrough technology (Garst et al, 2016, Nature Biotechnology In Press 33) that combines multiplex DNA oligomer synthesis, phage-based recombineering, and the CRISPR/Cas9 system to enable SAR mapping at a scale orders of magnitude beyond prior approaches. Here, we will expand this approach to demonstrate SAR mapping at a new scale (pathway level SAR mapping) and in a clinically relevant model system. We specifically propose to comprehensively map sequence to activity across the DXP pathway; an essential pathway in a range of pathogens including various bacteria and apicomplexan protozoa such as the malaria-causing Plasmodium falciparum (Pf). While treatment with inhibitors of this pathway can be effective12,13, resistance eventually emerges. Sequence-activity mapping of this pathway in the presence and absence of specific inhibitors will not only identify a range of targets for inhibiting this pathway but also uncover mutations leading to resistance. Thus, our efforts here will result in new specific understanding about a clinically important pathway as well as more broadly demonstrate a new platform for SAR mapping that extends to the pathway scale. At the end of this R21 program, we will specifically have generated quantitative data relating each of several tens of thousands targeted sequence alterations to the activity of the essential DXP pathway. The maps will be generated not only for the native Ec pathway but also for the clinically relevant pathway taken from the malaria pathogen P. falciparum. All methods and data will be broadly disseminated to aide in the adoption of this new approach for multiplex SAR mapping. Importantly, this proposal aligns well with the NIAID research agenda for malaria, specifically to better understand and confront drug resistance and elucidate mechanisms of drug resistance14."
"9298321","Increased perfusion of the hippocampal CA1 subfield is a clinical biomarker for early psychosis that also predicts hippocampal volume loss. Converging evidence suggests that CA1 hyperperfusion reflects excessive glutamatergic transmission which drives psychosis and may produce excitotoxic hippocampal injury that is associated with poor outcomes. Antipsychotics reduce hippocampal activity but may worsen hippocampal injury via oxidative stress from increased dopamine release. We recently demonstrated hippocampal volume loss at an annualized mean rate of 6.5% during the first 8 weeks of antipsychotic treatment. Levetiracetam, an anticonvulsant, normalizes excessive glutamatergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission by targeting the synaptic vesicle protein (SVP2A). Levetiracetam is neuroprotective in animal and human models of hippocampal hyperactivity. We hypothesize that levetiracetam will protect against hippocampal volume loss and improve clinical outcomes in early psychosis by reducing excessive glutamate and dopamine transmission. Approach: We will establish target engagement and dose selection by measuring the effects of levetiracetam 185 mg and 500 mg on hippocampal perfusion in a placebo-controlled trial in 24 medication- naïve individuals with first episode psychosis. We will then study the optimal levetiracetam dose added to antipsychotic in a 12-week placebo-controlled trial in 84 medication naïve individuals with first episode psychosis. We will examine whether levetiracetam prevents hippocampal volume loss and improves clinical symptoms and cognition and will explore potential mediators and modulators of effect. Significance: By correcting a fundamental dysregulation of hippocampal neurotransmission, we believe levetiracetam will improve initial treatment response in first episode psychosis and fundamentally change the course of illness."
"9264582","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Influenza A virus (IAV) and human rhinovirus (HRV) trigger severe exacerbations in asthma patients. Early diagnosis of these viruses may improve clinical outcomes, avoid inappropriate antibiotic use, and reduce the severity of exacerbations. While PCR-based tests are the gold standard, time and cost limit widespread use. The analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled human breath is an innovative technique that may be a non- invasive, cost-effective, point-of-care method to rapidly diagnose early viral infections, although studies of this methodology are lacking. Our main hypotheses are that breath VOC analysis will distinguish virus-infected asthma patients from un-infected asthmatic controls, and that the VOCs seen in asthmatic human breath derive from airway epithelial cells the sites of viral infection. We will study breath VOCs from asthmatic patients with and without virus infections recruited from our well-established UC Asthma Network clinics. We will also use asthmatic airway epithelial cells obtained from research bronchoscopies to study VOC production following experimental IAV and HRV infection. The long-term goal is to enable early, rapid, and specific detection of respiratory virus infections for which current tests are limited. The ultimate goal of our research program is to reduce the severity of asthma exacerbations and enable patients and clinicians to make rapid and appropriate treatment decisions , both in the office and at home. The use of our unique VOC collection system for cell cultures provides a robust ex vivo model to ultimately test a variety of interventions (e.g., drugs) on cellular VOC production which will eventually inform future clinical breath studies. My long-term career goals are to lead the research mission of a chronic lung disease center with a focus on clinical breath testing. I ultimately plan to build a consortium linking multiple clinical breath testing sites undr the purpose of advancing breath research. This has the potential to speed diagnosis of many lung diseases including viral infections. Further training in subject recruitment and research team management; advanced breath collection; cell culturing techniques; and developing co-culture models for VOC analysis of virus infections will facilitate these goals. The training from this K23 will lay the foundation for a research career using VOC analysis to test clinical interventions for asthma, pulmonary infections, as well as other lung diseases. The research and training environment at UC Davis includes the NIH Clinical and Translational Science Center (CTSC); the UC Asthma Network (UCAN) clinics with a robust research infrastructure and several ongoing clinical studies; the Center for Comparative Respiratory Biology and Medicine (CCRBM) which includes many collaborative investigators focused on airway biology; and graduate classes in clinical and advanced statistics and cell culturing techniques. The CTSC has been established to facilitate clinical and translational research, and as an environment to support researchers at all levels in their careers. UC Davis has an established track record of excellence in patient-oriented research and collaborative, multidisciplinary research efforts."
"9373112","Sustained availability of efficacious drugs is essential for worldwide efforts to eradicate malaria. The emergence and spread of drug resistance to current antimalarial therapies remains a pressing concern with reports of artemisinin-based treatment failures escalating the need for novel antimalarial chemotherapies. Thus the discovery of novel druggable targets and pathways, including those that are critical for multiple life stages, is a major challenge for the development of next-generation therapeutics. Using an integrated chemogenomic approach, we have previously identified the cytoplasmic prolyl tRNA synthetase in Plasmodium falciparum (PfcPRS) as the long-sought biochemical target of halofuginone. Furthermore, we uncovered an unprecedented mechanism of drug-tolerance to halofuginone in the parasite by modulation of proline homeostasis. However, small molecule inhibtors that bind PfcPRS in a mode distinct from halofuginone are active, not cross-resistant and elicit a distinct biological response. In this proposal, we seek to establish the molecular basis for this differential response and identify lead compounds that will allow us to further mechanistically probe the consequences of PfcPRS inhibition. We bring an integrated approach combining our expertise in molecular parasitology, genetics, metabolomics, structural biology, and rational inhibitor design to probe these aspects of aminoacyl tRNA synthetase biology and inhibition in the parasite. We will explore the inhibitor class dependent downstream signaling of PRS inhibition, evaluating the role of tRNA signaling and inhibition mode. Specifically we will mechanistically and functionally characterize the molecular consequences of PRS inhibition depending on the interference of the small molecule inhibitor with tRNA binding and develop new PfcPRS inhibitors that allow us to probe the relevance of inhibition of the tRNA binding pocket and demonstrate improved selectivity"
"9266686","Microtubules (MTs) form complex intracellular networks that not only provide mechanical stability for cell structure and motility, but also from the tracks along which molecular motors traffic cargos to specific sub- cellular sites. While most MT networks have a relatively short half-life, recent work has shown that a subset (-10%) of post-translationally modified MTs are highly stable and function in a various biological processes. However, their role and regulation during viral infection remains poorly understood. Our screens for host factors that determine cellular susceptibility to infection by various viruses, in collaboration with Gundersen (Project 1), Walsh (Project 3) and Goff (Project 4) identified a number of novel regulators of stable MT formation, highlighting the potential role of this stable subset of MTs as specialized tracks for viral trafficking. Our collaborative effort with Gundersen to explore this more directly resulted in identification of the kinesin, Kif4 as an EBl-interacting regulator of MT stability and HIV-1 infection. In addition, Kif4 is also bound by Gag, a retroviral structural polyprotein that has been suggested to promote MT stabilization. Combined with our preliminary data showing that HIV-1 infection promotes stable MT formation and incoming viral cores colocalize with this stable MT subset, this suggests that Kif4:EB1 complexes represent a specific MT tip- binding complex specifically targeted by HIV-1. In this proposal we will map the domains in Kif4 and EBl that mediate their effects on stability and trafficking of HlV-1 during both early stage (inward-directed) movement of viral cores and late stage (outward-directed) movement and budding of viral particles. We will also determine the effects of infection or Gag expression on Kif4:EB1 complex formation and function in mediating MT stabilization during distinct phases of infection, and define the domains in Gag that mediate interactions with Kif4:EB1 complexes to determine how this viral protein affects complex formation and/or activity. Finally, we will determine whether infection or Gag expression manipulates localized signaling nodes to regulate MT formation and/or Kif4:EB1 function as virions enter the cell. This work takes advantage of working closely with members of this PPG with expertise in cytoskeletal regulation, motor-based virion movement, live imaging and cell signaling, as well as using the Imaging Core to develop a real-time image of the dynamic events involved in viral interactions with host MT networks and the role of highly specialized MT regulators in these events. This will provide detailed mechanistic insight into the role of MT regulators and subsets during HIV-1 infection, with important implications for our general understanding of MT regulation and cargo transport."
"9250216","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The Neurochemistry Core is a dual function core that will support the research efforts ofthe Projects by providing services while at the same time developing new tools and datasets that will ultimately inform each ofthe Projects. The core will provide basic histology services to document probe placements for Projects 1 and 2, and will perform quantitative oxytocin receptor (OXTR) autoradiography in rats and voles for Project 1. Th13 Core will also provide Projects 2 and 3 with novel potent and selective OXTR antagonists for their studies in nonhuman primates.     In addition, the Core will play a critical role in delineating the neuroanatomical localization of OXTR in the primate brain (currently not understood). This knowledge is essential for understanding the neural mechanisms by which oxytocin (OT) modulates social cognition in Projects 2 and 3. We will use a three pronged approach for mapping the OXTR in rhesus monkey brain. First, a validated RT-PCR technique will be used to map the location of OXTR in amygdala (Amy) subnuclei as well as to determine the neuronal phenotype of OXTR neurons after single cell recording. Second, we will work to improve the selectivity of receptor autoradiography procedures in primate tissue. Finally we will continue our effort to develop and validate novel PET ligands for in vivo imaging of OXTR in living brains. If successful, the PET ligands will contribute directly to the goals of Project 2 and 3 and may ultimately be used to inform the human studies in Project 4.  These aims and the functions and services that they support are essential for the integration of research designs and interpretation of findings across projects and will provide for the first time an understanding of the neural distribution of OXTR in the primate brain. The novel OXTR antagonists and PET' ligands will have a tremendous benefit for the entire research community investigating the role of OT on social behavior."

They are used to probe the role of cancer genes in cell and developmental biology, investigate the mechanisms of tumor development, progression and metastasis, evaluate drug response and resistance, and test novel strategies and devices for tumor detection and drug delivery. The ES Cell & Transgenics Core is an Institutional Shared Resource that provides Koch Institute investigators with consultative advice, technical support and/or training in the production of engineered cells and mouse models. In the current period, the capabilities of this Core have been further expanded and enhanced. This includes moving into a larger, custom-designed space in the new Koch Institute building, the addition of new services and a reorganization of the staff to support novice users and provide project-customized services. Notably, in the same period, usage of the ES Cell & Transgenics Core by Center Members increased from 29% to 51%, including investigators from all four programs. Thus, this Shared Resource is essential to the success of the Koch Institute mission. In the upcoming period, the ES Cell & Transgenics Core will continue to offer a wide range of state-of-the-art services to support the research programs of Center Members. In spite of the significant expansion of services and usage, the requested CCSG budget for Year 44 is 13% lower than the requested and recommended budget in Year 39."
"9359402","Abstract ? Core A (Pathology Core)  Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a uniquely challenging neoplasm because of the formidable  complexities of its histopathology, and limited tissue availability and quality. The pathologic analysis of murine  PDAC, and its cognate human counterpart, is an integral component for all projects of this P01. Broadly  speaking, these activities include evaluation of genetically engineered mice (GEM), including mice with  temporally regulated, compartment-specific disruption in epithelial and / or stromal components; analyses of  tumor promoting signaling pathways with cell-type specific localization to either neoplastic cells per se, or  within the host response in the tumor microenvironment (TME); identification and multi-dimensional  assessments of cellular components within the TME; and the cross-species validation of observations between  GEM models and human tumor samples. The Pathology Core (Core A) will collect, maintain, archive and  record all human and mouse PDAC-associated biological resources. These materials include serially  passaged patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) created from primary and metastatic human PDAC, and a  repository of annotated low-passage PDAC cell lines. Core A will work in close collaboration with the  Project Investigators to achieve three specific aims: i) to provide histology services and consultative expertise,  including centralized review in the pathologic evaluation of mouse and human pancreatic neoplasms; ii) to  provide infrastructure and technical expertise for a variety of immunohistochemical, immunofluorescent and in  situ hybridization assays with quantitative image analysis; and iii) to generate, characterize and maintain PDX  models, as well as early passage tumor and stromal cells cultures for use by the Projects and Core B  (Experimental Therapeutics). A testament to this Core?s progress stems from the creation of >165 PDXs and  >30 low passage PDAC cell lines during the previous cycle. Core A?s leader is Dr. Anirban Maitra at MDACC,  assisted by Co-Investigator Dr. Huamin Wang - both with long-standing expertise and a strong publication  record in the histopathological and molecular assessment of human and murine PDAC tissues. In addition,  Core A brings together expertise from our partner institution, Harvard (Dr. Bardeesy, site PI at MGH), who is a  prolific investigator in PDAC biology and an expert in GEM models thereof. Of note, despite the geographic  distance, there exists outstanding published evidence for collaboration between this tightly knit team. To  facilitate a seamless administration of Core A activities, we have instituted a system of regular communication  through teleconferences, Skype and use of telepathology resources that enables the three significant  personnel involved in the Core (Maitra, Wang and Bardeesy) to coordinate and serve the needs of this P01.  Core A will build upon the solid foundation of prior and ongoing interactions between investigators at MDACC  and Harvard, in order to facilitate a highly successful P01 outcome."
"9488104","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The digestive system is critical for the well-being of individuals and of populations. The central objective of this training grant is to prepare young scientists for investigative and academic careers relevant to the digestive health of children. This grant will provide rigorous investigative training by immersing promising young scientists in opportunities at Washington University School of Medicine that address digestive health challenges of children worldwide.  The rationale for this program is based on two premises: high quality research experiences soon after graduate or clinical training are critical for successful academic careers, and there is a shortage of trained individuals to solve problems relevant to, or caused by, the childhood digestive system. The program encompasses diverse disciplines and topics, but all mentors and projects are linked by three common motifs: 1. they perform research that directly relates to relevant questions, 2. individual mentored environments are robust, and 3. trainees are integrated into existing projects, and receive rigorous individual preparation for research careers. In this application, we expand our successful program that has previously focused on pediatric gastroenterology trainees to a very well qualified surgical trainee cohort.  The program uses a three track system. Trainees in Track I (Microbial - Host interactions in the Gastrointestinal Tract), choose a project exploring the role of microbes in childhood intestinal health and well- being. In this Track, trainees can focus on specific pathogens or their mechanisms, or on polymicrobial microbiology (i.e., the microbiome). Track II (Cellular and Molecular Biology of the Developing Gastrointestinal Tract) trainees focus on the molecular and genetic aspects of congenital and acquired disorders of the childhood gastrointestinal tract. Track III (Translational Biology of the Gastrointestinal Tract) trainees us human subjects or human subjects' materials to delineate causes, treatments, and prevention of digestive disorders of childhood.  This two year training program will be for individuals with M.D. and/or Ph.D. degrees in biomedical sciences. We will draw from our traditional base of pediatric gastroenterology fellows and qualified postdoctoral associates, and also enrich our applicant flow by opening training opportunities to surgical residents. This amalgamation of trainee pipeline and training opportunities under the support of this training grant will take full advantae of our growing and multi-level collaborations between pediatric gastroenterology and pediatric surgical research in our institution. The goal is to produce scientists with enduring interests in childhood gastrointestinal disorders, and the causes, treatments, and prevention of these illnesses."
"9258630","Proposal Summary Fasting has long been a part of many religions and cultures and is now being used in the clinic to promote weight loss and potentially reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. The heart is a highly metabolic tissue and only stores enough energy for five heartbeats. It is unclear how the myocardium choses a metabolic source when nutrient supply is limited during fasting or what effects this has on the heart long term. Bile acids increase in the serum after a meal and may serve as a systemic fed-state marker. Bile acids are a ligand for the nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR). FXR is a transcriptional regulator of several genes involved in metabolism and indirectly regulates autophagic gene transcription. Autophagy is the recycling of damaged or excess cellular proteins and supplies a cell with macromolecules and nutrients. Activation of FXR decreases autophagy in the liver. Further, antagonism of FXR in the myocardium is protective in ischemia reperfusion (IR). The preliminary data in this proposal show that FXR is present in cardiomyocytes, its activation reduces autophagy and suggests a switch to glucose oxidation, regulating metabolic substrate choice. This represent a potential new mechanism for the myocardium to sense and respond to systemic nutrient availability and is in line with literature from the liver and intestine. Further, we demonstrate that induction of autophagy during IR is protective. In preliminary studies, autophagy was induced by a peptide and we will expand upon these studies to evaluate the role of FXR-induced autophagy in protection from IR injury. The proposed work aims to evaluate FXR as a fed-state regulator of autophagy and metabolism through complementary in vivo experiments with FXR knockout mice and in vitro experiments in adult, neonatal and embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. We will use FXR knockout mice to assess the role of FXR and autophagy in protection from IR injury. We will use both natural and synthetic agonists of FXR, as well as siRNA knockdown in vitro to confirm the specificity of the effects. Collectively, these studies will provide insight into the potential coordination of autophagy and metabolism by FXR in the nutrient deprived myocardium, the effects of fasting on the myocardium and the protective role of autophagy in IR. The insights will offer new avenues for IR intervention."
"9247241","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our goal is to understand how thoracic multi detector-row computed tomography (MDCT) combined with innovative image analysis techniques can be used to identify COPD patients at greatest risk. The overall objective of this proposal is to focus on the pulmonary vasculature. We hypothesize that novel quantitative MDCT-based metrics that characterize heterogeneity of pulmonary parenchymal perfusion and pulmonary vascular anatomy in early stage COPD subjects will allow us to identify subjects at greater risk for rapid disease progression. Numerous observations from our own laboratories and others point to an abnormal pulmonary vascular response to smoking induced parenchymal inflammation that leads to the development of emphysema. We have established imaging methods for the quantitative assessment of the pulmonary vascular tree and regional pulmonary parenchymal perfusion status. The former measure takes advantage of volumetric MDCT and the later makes use of dual energy MDCT (DE-MDCT) to provide clinically implementable tools for the interrogation of lung structure and function. Our Specific Aims are as follows: (1) determine whether objective, quantitative measures of increased PBV heterogeneity derived from DE-MDCT, as an index of emphysema susceptibility, will serve as a very early indicator of rapid emphysema progression (assessed by MDCT) and lung function decline; (2) determine whether anatomic changes in pulmonary vascular geometry will identify subjects at risk for more rapid emphysema progression and lung function decline, possibly in more urgent need of intervention; and (3) determine whether early anatomic and functional markers of vascular disease will combine to identify subjects at increased risk for development of frequent exacerbations who require more intense therapy before significant lung function decline has occurred. In this time-sensitive proposal, we will leverage the Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study (SPIROMICS). SPIROMICS offers a unique opportunity to study at risk smokers and individuals with COPD in a longitudinal study that are well-characterized in terms of repeated clinical, physiological and biological evaluations. We propose to insert a baseline DE-MDCT scan to evaluate an index of pulmonary perfusion heterogeneity (Perfused Blood Volume: PBV) in 200 GOLD 0/I subjects at baseline and to insert a 3rd year MDCT exam into the SPIROMICS protocol for these same individuals. We also propose a year 3 MDCT exam in an additional 125 GOLD II-III SPIROMICS subjects. Our over-riding goal is to evaluate early functional and anatomic indices of vascular dysfunction to determine the association between these metrics and rate of emphysema progression, lung function decline and risk of AECOPD."
"9247726","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dissection and/or rupture of ascending thoracic aortic aneurysms (aTAA) are catastrophic emergencies with 40% pre-hospital mortality, and operative mortality as high as 25%. Clinical guidelines recommend elective surgical repair based primarily on aTAA size, as well as growth, symptoms, and bicuspid or connective tissue pathologies. However, significant proportion of type A dissection patients presented with aortas under specified size limits for repair. Our long-term goal is to modernize clinical aTAA decision-making using patient-specific biomechanics, fluid dynamics, and clinical profiles to predict rupture/dissection and risk-stratify patients for earlier surgical repair. The rationale is that aTA rupture/dissection is a mechanical failure occurring when wall stress exceeds wall strength. Guidelines use diameter as a surrogate for wall stress based on LaPlace's Law. We hypothesize that fluid structure interaction (FSI) analyses of aTAA wall stress is a better predictor of true wall stress and therefore better predict adverse clinical events than diameter. True wall stress, unfortunately, cannot be measured directly in vivo but requires ex vivo aTAA specimens, where patient-specific 3D zero- pressure geometry, wall thickness, residual stress, and material properties can be measured with very high resolution. Prior aTAA computational models have made numerous assumptions using generalized wall thickness, literature-based material properties, and often ignored zero-stress geometry-all of which substantially change simulation results. The Achilles heel of aTAA models to date is that none have been validated casting doubts on their accuracy and clinical utility. We propose a prospective study to compare the effectiveness of FSI vs. diameter-based approaches in predicting true wall stress in surgical aTAA patients. Aims are: 1) Develop and validate in vivo patient-specific FSI in aTAA patients undergoing repair with the gold standard, ex vivo patient-specific aTAA from surgical specimen controls; 2) Demonstrate superiority of in vivo FSI over diameter in predicting true wall stress; 3 Quantify aTAA wall material strength from aTAA specimens and elucidate its relationship to regional aTAA wall stress. Develop empirical model to noninvasively predict in vivo wall strength; 4) Compare aortic wall stress and material properties between normal subjects and surgical aTAA patients. Define high-risk profiles using wall stress, fluid shear stress and turbulence, and clinical risk factors. We propose to first improve accuracy of in vivo aTAA FSI using 4-D flow cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) with Cine Displacement Encoding with Simulated Echos (DENSE) to determine wall material properties, wall thickness, and zero-stress geometry. We will validate in vivo models with surgical aTAA specimens and correlate aTAA failure strength with stress. Our development of high risk profiles using advanced CMR techniques to determine wall stress and fluid shear stress coupled with clinical risk factors may be used in the future to prospectively follow and predict growth and complications in all aTAA patients"
"9277756","Project Summary Aberrant patterns in the epigenomic landscape have been closely associated with cancer. Deregulation of histone modifications silences tumor-suppressor genes, triggers genetic changes via aberrant DNA repair/replication, and contributes to tumor heterogeneity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay is the technique of choice for examining epigenetic mechanisms in vivo such as histone modifications. However, the technique in its conventional form suffers from serious limitations. The prevailing ChIP-seq protocol requires 107 cells per test, involves extensive manual handling of the samples, and takes 3-4 days to generate a sequencing library. The requirement of a large sample amount practically prevents the use of ChIP-seq on samples from scarce sources such as animal models and patients. We recently demonstrated a microfluidic technology (microfluidic-oscillatory-washing-based ChIP-seq or MOWChIP-seq) for profiling genome-wide histone modifications using as few as 100 cells. In this R33 project, we will develop the next-generation MOWChIP-seq technology by facilitating high throughput, improving the level of integration, and further validating the technology via testing mouse and human samples. The development will fully validate the use of MOWChIP- seq for high-throughput epigenomic profiling of a large number of samples in clinical research settings."
"9371825","Melioidosis is a tropical infection caused by inoculation, inhalation, or ingestion of the Gram-negative soil saprophyte and Tier 1 select agent Burkholderia pseudomallei. Disease is often severe and treatment is hampered by difficulty eradicating the pathogen due to its extensive antimicrobial resistance. Pneumonia and bacteremia are common presentations and often result in sepsis and multi-organ failure. The overall melioidosis mortality rate is 40% in southeast Asia and 20% in northern Australia. No vaccine is available and efforts to reduce environmental exposure to the bacterium have been challenging. Although the distribution of B. pseudomallei in the environment is not fully determined, recent modeling work suggests that it may be widespread and that an extraordinary 165,000 cases of human melioidosis and 89,000 deaths occur annually worldwide. Studies show that there is marked inter-individual variation in the whole blood innate immune response to bacterial ligands in vitro. There is also significant inter-individual variation in the ability of B. pseudomallei to enter and replicate in primary human cells such as alveolar macrophages and monocytes. Remarkably, it has been reported that the heritability ? or proportion of the observed phenotype explained by genetic factors ? of Salmonella invasion of cells exceeds 50%. Combined, this suggests that naturally occurring phenotypic variation in vitro can be exploited to identify variants in genes that regulate host defense against invading bacteria such as B. pseudomallei. EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from extensively genotyped and sequenced individuals in the HapMap/100 Genomes Projects are a useful tool for in vitro screening of genetic regulators of disease-related traits. In vitro phenotypes can be merged with readily available and unparalleled genomic structure data to perform cellular genome wide association studies (GWAS) efficiently and cheaply. LCLs infected with B. pseudomallei demonstrate differential invasion and replication dynamics. This likely reflects significant heritability in the host response to infection, and indicates that LCL-based cellular GWAS can be effectively used to study modulators of host defense in melioidosis. Understanding the host determinants of successful B. pseudomallei invasion and replication within cells is crucial to developing strategies to prevent infection with this resourceful pathogen. The hypothesis of this project is that novel host genetic variation modulates the dynamics of host cell invasion in melioidosis and that these genetic modulators can be identified by performing cellular GWAS of quantitative LCL phenotypes. The aims of this project are to 1) identify genetic determinants of B. pseudomallei invasion and survival in lymphoblastoid cell lines and 2) validate observed genetic associations in primary human lymphocytes and monocytes. This exploratory project offers exciting potential to open up new avenues of knowledge about host defense in melioidosis. Such new knowledge is essential to tackle this increasingly global public health threat."
"9446410","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and Barrett's esophagus (BE) are the major risk factors for esophageal adenocarcinoma. To prevent this deadly cancer, patients with BE are advised to have regular endoscopic surveillance for dysplasia and, when dysplasia is discovered, to have it treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Unfortunately, surveillance does not appear to prevent deaths from esophageal cancer in BE patients, and recurrence of Barrett's metaplasia occurs frequently after RFA. Surveillance failures and metaplasia recurrences might be due to a condition called subsquamous intestinal metaplasia (SSIM), in which metaplastic glands are located in the lamina propria underneath a layer of squamous epithelium that hides them from the endoscopist and protects them from destruction by RFA. Initially, SSIM was thought to develop as a consequence of ablation procedures. However, recent studies have shown that SSIM is present under squamous epithelium close to the squamo-Barrett's epithelial junction in the large majority of patients with BE, even in the absence of ablation procedures. This SSIM might be the source of tumors missed by endoscopic surveillance, and the nidus for recurrent metaplasia after RFA. Thus, SSIM appears to be a frequent and important condition that is thwarting attempts to prevent cancer in BE.  Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is the process in which epithelial cells acquire mesenchymal cell characteristics such as motility and invasiveness. In BE, EMT could result in SSIM by enabling metaplastic epithelial cells to move into the lamina propria underneath the adjacent squamous epithelium. This notion is supported by a mouse model of pancreatic cancer in which metaplastic pancreatic cells in inflamed areas acquire markers of EMT and invade the pancreatic stroma. Our preliminary data demonstrate that exposures to acid and bile salts cause non-neoplastic Barrett's epithelial cells to acquire features of EMT.  GERD can cause reflux esophagitis, and inflamed tissues often are hypoxic, a condition that can activate hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs). Our preliminary data show that Barrett's epithelial cells exposed to acid and bile salts exhibit a strong and sustained increase in nuclear HIF-1a and HIF-2a. Recent data suggest that HIF- 1a and HIF-2a can promote EMT in cancers by causing tumor cells to secrete vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which binds the cells' VEGF receptors in an autocrine fashion to induce VEGF signaling, which results in EMT. Our preliminary data show that acid and bile salts induce autocrine VEGF signaling in non- neoplastic Barrett's epithelial cells. Therefore, we hypothesize that reflux-induced activation of HIFs in Barrett's epithelial cells causes VEGF secretion with autocrine VEGF signaling, which initiates the EMT program and causes SSIM. The aims of this study are to elucidate the mechanism(s) whereby acid and bile salts activate HIFs to cause VEGF production, and to explore the role of autocrine VEGF signaling in the EMT program induced by acid and bile salts in non-neoplastic Barrett's cells in vitro, and in patients with BE in vivo."

"9278259","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The decision to disclose one's serostatus to family members creates considerable emotional strain for people living with HIV (PLWH), regardless of gender and sexual orientation. While disclosure to family members has been linked to positive outcomes including increased social support, improved physical and mental health outcomes, reduced loneliness and stress, and improved HIV disease management, the decision not to disclose can also lead to positive outcomes. To date, most research about serostatus disclosure has focused on the act of disclosing - the who, what, where, and when of disclosing - rather than the decision process involved. Based on lessons learned during the pilot study of this intervention, disclosure decision-making is a lifelong process and PLWH can benefit from an intervention which helps them clarify their disclosure-related goals, weigh the costs and rewards of disclosure and non-disclosure, identify strategies that will minimize potential costs - and even helps them come to terms with the decision not to disclose. Our long-range goal is to further refine and evaluate an intervention designed to enhance HIV disclosure decision-making among PLWH. To reach this goal, we are proposing a course of study with the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Conduct a randomized, controlled trial (n=450) of the piloted intervention, and assess the effectiveness of the intervention relative to an attention- control condition on a variety of primary outcomes related to disclosure and health. Specific Aim 2: Examine the effects of the intervention over time. Specific Aim 3: Explore potential moderating effects of participant demographics, relationship characteristics, and contextual variables related to family on intervention effectiveness. Specific Aim 4: Evaluate the effects of treatment engagement, retention, and expectations on outcomes. The central hypothesis of this proposal is based on the Consequences Theory of Disclosure. According to the theory, positive persons weigh the rewards and costs of disclosing their status to family. Whenever the rewards outweigh the costs, disclosure occurs. We have adapted our theory and intervention to incorporate fundamental processes of decision making such as clarifying antecedent goals, decision making, and decision evaluation. This proposal is highly innovative in two very important ways. First, to date, no evidence-based intervention has been developed to assist PLWH in making decisions about disclosure to family. Second, the focus of this intervention is on the disclosure decision-making process and comfort/acceptance with the disclosure decision. As such, skills learned through the intervention can be applied to the lifelong process of serostatus disclosure."
"9268093","Project Summary/Abstract: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease in the CNS. It is generally believed that MS and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), are initiated by an autoimmune reaction against oligodendrocytes and myelin. Evidence suggests that oligodendrocyte death induced by inflammatory attacks contributes significantly to the development of MS and EAE. Nuclear Factor ? B (NF-?B) plays a critical role in inflammatory diseases, including MS and EAE, by regulating inflammation and cell viability. Although activation of NF-?B has been observed in oligodendrocytes in MS and EAE, the effects of NF-?B on oligodendrocytes in these diseases remain largely unexplored. In vitro studies from our lab and other groups show that NF-?B activation promotes oligodendrocyte survival in response to inflammatory mediators. Our recent study shows that activation of pancreatic endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) signaling in oligodendrocytes protects mice against EAE and that the protective effects of PERK signaling on oligodendrocytes during EAE are associated with NF-?B activation. Importantly, our preliminary data showed that NF-?B inactivation specifically in oligodendrocytes exacerbated interferon-? (IFN-?)-induced myelinating oligodendrocyte death and hypomyelination in young, developing mice. Our preliminary observation also suggested that NF-?B inactivation specifically in oligodendrocytes significantly increased EAE disease severity. Therefore, we hypothesize that NF-?B activation acts cell-autonomously to protect oligodendrocytes against inflammatory attacks in MS and EAE and accounts for the protective effects of PERK activation on oligodendrocytes in these diseases. In the first specific aim, we will determine whether NF-?B inactivation acts in a cell-autonomous manner to render (re)myelinating oligodendrocytes vulnerable to the detrimental effects of IFN-?, a key proinflammatory cytokine in MS and EAE. In the second specific aim, we will determine whether NF-?B activation cell-autonomously protects oligodendrocytes against inflammatory attacks, resulting in attenuation of EAE disease severity. In the third specific aim, we will determine whether NF-?B activation is required for the protective effects of PERK signaling on oligodendrocytes during EAE. This work will define the cytoprotective effects of the NF-?B pathway, particularly the PERK-NF-?B pathway, on oligodendrocytes (both mature and remyelinating oligodendrocytes) in MS and EAE, which will advance our understanding of the mechanisms governing oligodendrocyte viability in MS."
"9480922","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Head and neck cancers (HNC) impose a significant biomedical burden by accounting for over 8000 deaths and 50,000 new cases each year. HNC patients often require multimodality treatment with surgery, radiation (XRT), and chemotherapy. Although XRT has increased survival it also results in damage to adjacent normal tissues leading to significant morbidity. The corrosive impact of these XRT-induced side effects can be unrelenting and their complex management is rarely remedial. Severely problematic wound healing issues impact the reconstructive efforts to replace the bone and soft tissue removed by tumor extirpation and the options to treat XRT-induced pathologic fractures and osteoradionecrosis. Standard of care currently dictates complex mandibular reconstruction utilizing free tissue transfer from other parts of the body requiring extended hospitalizations. Attendant complications often lead to delays in initiation of therapy jeopardizing prognosis as well as quality of life. Advances in biotechnology have afforded a unique opportunity to innovate new remedies for XRT-induced side effects by bringing novel and more effective therapeutic strategies into the actual operating theater. Distraction Osteogenesis (DO), the creation of new bone by the gradual separation of two osteogenic fronts, generates an anatomical and functional replacement of deficient tissue from local substrate and could have immense potential for reconstruction after oncologic resection. XRT drastically impairs fracture healing, however, precluding the utilization of DO as a durable reconstructive method for HNC. The central hypothesis to be tested in this proposal is that the deleterious effects of XRT on bone formation can be mitigated to allow successful regeneration of the mandible and restore the capacity for normal bone healing. We further posit that new treatment strategies can be designed to combine tissue engineering techniques and pharmacological optimization in order to develop applications that can be utilized synchronously with operative reconstruction, to fundamentally transform current surgical paradigms. Our laboratory recently demonstrated specific metrics of diminished bone quality at the healing interface of irradiated mandibles. We then employed a series of pharmacologic and tissue engineering strategies to assuage the adverse impact of XRT induced injury. Each of our therapies demonstrated remediation of the XRT-induced degradation of bone healing. The consequential finding of these experiments was the ability to generate new bone formation and a bony union in scenarios where this was not previously possible. Although, the key metrics of bone healing were successfully enhanced, they were not completely restored and candidate cell lines and cell-based remedies that could benefit from therapeutic synergies and potentially be isolated and manipulated directly in the operating room still require innovative solutions in order to be fully optimized for translation to the clinical aena. The current proposal entails developing those synergies and innovative solutions in order to translate our findings from the bench to the operative suite to improve the treatment for this severely compromised patient population."

"9323706","The overarching goal of the parent grant (R24 OD020347-01A1) is to establish standards for a nutritionally healthy, captive common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). The common marmoset has become an increasingly popular nonhuman primate research model; however the full potential of this species as a research model is impeded by our lack of understanding of its nutritional requirements. The planned studies in the parent grant will identify the critical features of a standardized basic diet for captive common marmosets; determine links between diet, gut microbiome, and disease; and establish standards for healthy weights, body condition, and biomarkers of metabolic function. The Specific Aims of the parent grant are: (1) Conducting nutritional assessments regarding select macro- and micro-nutrient requirements for marmosets and their relations to biomarkers of gut function; (2) Validating markers of healthy weight and metabolic function in captive common marmosets; (3) Identifying links between nutrition and disease in captive common marmosets. An important refinement to the parent grant is the ability to use identical, modern equipment for the measurement of all components of the energy balance equation at both sites, greatly reducing the impact of inter-site variability and increasing the accuracy of identifying diet effects. To accomplish these refinements, we request support for the purchase of: (1) a point-of-care (POC) HbA1C immunoassay analyzer (DCA Advantage Analyzer, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Malvern, PA) for each site to allow assessment of HbA1C more rapidly and importantly on a significantly smaller sample (1 µl sample), a vital factor for this small-bodied species. This will facilitate the use of chronic glucose control as an important factor in understanding diet response and energy balance; (2) the same Echo MRI quantitative magnetic resonance unit (EchoMRI-Marmoset-700TM, EchoMRI LLC, Houston, TX) currently used by SNPRC for WNPRC. WNPRC currently analyzes body composition on sedated animals by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. The ability of the Echo MRI unit to rapidly, precisely and accurately measure lean and fat mass in awake marmosets is a clear advantage; (3) equipment (FoxBox respirometry system and Actiwatch Mini accelerometers) that will allow us to more completely characterize energy balance in the Aim 2 animals. These additional assessments will greatly improve our ability to evaluate metabolic function in captive common marmosets. The equipment that will be available through this revision application will greatly enhance the parent R24 by allowing more consistent and complete measurements of animals at the two study sites; enhancing our understanding of nutrition and metabolic function in common marmosets; and setting the standard for captive nutritional care in this species. Given the growing appreciation of the influence of metabolism on myriad other biological systems, the enhanced metabolic assessments proposed in this revision application will result in a better characterized, and thus more valuable, biomedical research model and support continued collaborative studies of the marmoset at SNPRC and WNPRC."

"9374306","ABSTRACT Malaria is a major public health burden in many tropical regions of the world, causing a half million deaths and two hundred million clinical episodes every year. The utility of the first-line anti-malarial regimen, artemisinin combination therapy (ACT), is threatened by emerging resistance. Development of mechanistically distinct anti-malarials will be necessary to replace ACT once parasite resistance inevitably becomes widespread. Understanding fundamental biochemical processes that underpin both asexual and sexual parasite stages in the human host erythrocyte will stimulate the discovery of new drugs to treat disease and block transmission. This proposal seeks to accelerate the discovery and functional characterization of lipases, enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of a large, diverse class of biological molecules termed lipids. In Aim 1, a serine hydrolase activity-based probe will be employed to affinity-purify putative parasite lipases, which will then be identified using mass spectrometry. In a complementary approach, two high molecular weight putative lipases will be epitope tagged to assess their contributions to lipolytic transformations in the asexual malaria parasite. To establish the importance of the lipases uncovered in the discovery phase, the genes encoding the enzymes will be targeted for gene disruption. In Aim 2, the discovery of lipases in early and mature gametocytes will be accomplished using the activity-based probe/inhibitor competition approach that has proven successful in asexual parasites. These studies will provide a picture of the diversity of lipolytic serine hydrolases in asexual parasites and in developing and mature gametocytes. They will reveal critical and potentially druggable enzymes and may lead to the discovery of novel biochemical processes that allow the malaria parasite to flourish in human erythrocytes."
"9253434","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inhalational smoke (IS)-induced acute lung injury (ISALI) is a common clinical problem in major burn victims, contributing to the US annual burn-related death rate of 2-3 per 100,000 population, one of the highest in the developed world. ISALI is characterized by severe airway obstruction, fibrinous airway casts and debris and alveolar fibrin deposition. Airway casts are an important cause of lung dysfunction, morbidity and poor outcomes. There is no effective pharmacotherapy for this problem at this time. We have published preliminary data that shows that nebulization of tissue plasminogen activator; tPA improves lung dysfunction in our ovine model of ISALI. We have also published that perfluorocarbons (PFCs) offer unique therapeutic advantages for ISALI as they are mechanoprotective and cytoprotective, support gas exchange, and are uniformly distributed in the lung. These agents are also well-tolerated in the injured lung. We will test the hypothesis that fibrinolytic therapy appropriately delivered to airways is effective in both prevention and reversal of lung damage in ISALI. Our objective is to select the most effective fibrinolytic delivey regimen for treatment of ISALI. We will determine if a more bioavailable fibrinolysin that generates relatively lower levels of fibrinolytic activity; single chain uroknase PA (scuPA), or tPA, delivered either by nebulization or as a PFC suspension most effectively reverses lung dysfunction in ISALI in sheep. tPA is exquisitely sensitive to the major PA inhibitor in airway fluids; plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), which is markedly increased in airway fluids in ISALI. Our new recently published preliminary data show that scuPA remains bioavailable via formation of PAI-1 resistant complexes with a2macroglubulin in airway fluids. Additional new preliminary formulation data show that we can create stable suspensions of fibrinolysins in PFCs and can optimize nebulization of the fibrinolysins. Our Specific Aims are: 1) To optimize formulations of tPA or scuPA-based fibrinolytic therapy for airway delivery. 2) Determine whether nebulization of tPA or scuPA or PFC-suspensions of tPA or scuPA most effectively protects against lung injury associated with ISALI and 3) To determine whether optimized airway delivery of fibrinolysins reverses lung dysfunction in established ISALI. Our team, led by experts in PFC drug delivery, ISALI, ovine modeling, fibrinolysis, drug formulation and delivery if drugs to the airway will apply a range of state of the art techniques to complete the aims. This project will likely yield novel, clinically tractable, potentially paradigm shifting approaches to safely improve outcomes in ISALI."

"9265056","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a biologically heterogeneous disease. This heterogeneity likely reflects differences in pathways of cancer development and progression, and can translate to differences in risk factors and prognosis across biologically distinct subtypes of CRC. Serrated CRC is a newly-recognized, biologically distinct subtype of CRC that develops via the serrated pathway. This CRC subtype, characterized by an accumulation of aberrant methylation and specific BRAF or KRAS mutations in tumor DNA, accounts for approximately 20-30% of all CRC, and likely arises from sessile serrated adenomas and traditional serrated adenomas. Recent evidence suggests that the serrated CRC subtype has a poorer prognosis and is more difficult to prevent via current CRC screening methods. Despite this new evidence regarding the potentially aggressive nature of serrated CRC, relatively little is known about genetic risk factors, clinicopathologic features, and survival outcomes associated with cancers arising from the serrated pathway. The objective of this project is to characterize factors relating to the genetic predisposition, clinical presentation, and prognosis of serrated CRC. To achieve our objective, we will utilize the Puget Sound Colorectal Cancer Cohort (PSCCC). This study cohort combines the data and resources of two existing population-based studies, including approximately 2,200 CRC cases and 1,500 CRC-free controls, with new recruitment of approximately 1,300 incident invasive CRC cases ages 20-74 years at diagnosis. Consistent with protocols from the existing studies included in the PSCCC, all new cases will be identified through the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) cancer registry serving 13 counties in western Washington State. Eligible participants will be interviewed and asked to provide a buccal cell sample for genetic analyses; tumor specimens will be collected and tested for serrated CRC-defining attributes. With this large study cohort, we will have sufficient statistical power to evaluate differences in the distribution of germline genetic polymorphisms in serrated CRC cases as compared to controls, and to those with other forms of CRC (Aim 1). We will also determine differences between serrated and non-serrated CRC cases with respect to screening history and clinicopathologic factors at diagnosis, such as tumor stage, grade, histology, and anatomic site (Aim 2). Lastly, we will evaluate differences in survival after diagnosis for individuals with serrated versus non-serrated CRC, taking into account differences in treatment across case groups (Aim 3). Our study results may be used to better understand mechanisms specific to the development and progression of serrated CRC, and may ultimately inform the development of novel, targeted treatment agents and cancer prevention strategies directed at this aggressive CRC subtype. Furthermore, this well-characterized study cohort will serve as a resource for future investigations of new molecular CRC subtypes."
"9261489","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Mobilized autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) have replaced bone marrow as the source of hematopoietic stem cells because of more rapid neutrophil and platelet recovery, largely due to a higher yield of CD34+ cells in PBSC grafts. Various mobilization strategies using myeloid growth factors, particularly G-CSF (filgrastim), have been used either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. However, up to 40% of patients will fail to mobilize an optimal CD34 cell dose (defined as e5x106/kg). Plerixafor, a small molecule CXCR4 antagonist, in combination with G-CSF has been shown to increase total CD34+ cells mobilized compared to G-CSF alone, and is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for PBSC mobilization in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). However, a significant disadvantage of plerixafor is cost; adding $25,567 per patient compared to G-CSF alone in NHL patients in a recent economic analysis. Furthermore, 14-24% of MM and NHL patients receiving plerixafor plus G-CSF still failed to collect e2x106 CD34+ cells/kg in four days of apheresis in large trials. Our group has a long standing interest in the roles of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway on hematopoiesis and HSC and HPC trafficking, We have recently defined a new role for PGE2 in the hematopoietic niche and shown that non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) that inhibit COX enzymes responsible for PGE2 synthesis significantly enhance the number of HSC and HPC in peripheral blood, and act synergistically with G-CSF to mobilize PBSC with superior engraftment potential. This proposal seeks to translate our preclinical findings to develop a novel, inexpensive and more efficacious PBSC mobilizing regimen. Specifically, we propose to: Aim 1 Conduct a phase II clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of the combination of meloxicam and filgrastim for mobilizing autologous PBSC in patients with MM and NHL, hypothesizing that the combination of the FDA approved NSAID, meloxicam, and filgrastim will enhance the number of CD34+ cells collected in NHL and MM patients undergoing ASCT, and Aim 2 Utilize a molecular, phenotypic and functional approach to better understand the mechanism of action of NSAID on PBSC graft content and function, assessing the mobilized graft for CD34+ cells and their expression of CXCR4, and proliferation status, and immune cell content (Aim 2A), and performing gene expression microarrays and gene ontology enrichment analysis on CD34+ cells/HPC subsets to identify genes/biological pathways associated with NSAID-mediated change in HPC proliferative potential (Aim 2B). In the long-term, understanding these changes will allow us to more effectively bridge the differentiation gap post-transplant, and develop novel and potentially more efficacious and cost-effective mobilization regimens and strategies."

"9345848","Significance: South Africa has the highest burden of perinatally HIV-infected children in the world with an estimated 320,000 HIV-infected children. The public sector is responsible for the care of the vast majority of these children and is poorly prepared to facilitate transition from pediatric to adult services, a process critical for achieving long-term treatment success in this vulnerable population. Quantitative studies to date involving HIV-infected adolescents who have transitioned to adult care are inadequate to address the challenges facing South Africa due to 1) small sample sizes and 2) exclusive enrollment of adolescents in resource-rich areas. Innovation: This study will be the first evaluation, to our knowledge, of transition outcomes for HIV-infected adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa. We will use a national database to evaluate the largest number of HIV- infected adolescents who transitioned to adult care thus far allowing for a robust analysis of factors affecting transition. The proposed research will develop a transition readiness score to assist clinicians and researchers. Approach: We will determine the following outcomes: vital status, loss to follow up, and virologic failure among ~800 urban, perinatally HIV-infected adolescents who have transitioned to adult care at Prince Mshiyeni Hospital outside of Durban, South Africa (Aim 1). We will use qualitative and quantitative methods to determine the psychosocial, clinical, and structural factors that facilitate or hinder successful transition to adult care (Aim 2). Using data from Aims 1 and 2, we will develop a transition readiness score to identify adolescents ready for transition to adult care and those who may require additional support prior to or during transitioning to adult care (Aim 3). Investigators: Brian Zanoni trained in Internal Medicine and Pediatrics with specialization in Infectious Disease and is a new investigator with extensive clinical experience in adolescent HIV care in South Africa, as well as a strong research foundation and ample mentorship.

"9386475","Abstract Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a prototypical Phlebovirus (family Bunyaviridae), belongs to the NIAID Category A list of pathogens and the CDC list of potential bioterrorism agents. RVFV causes a disease that is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa and can emerge in explosive, mosquito-borne epidemics decimating herds of sheep and cattle, resulting in enormous economic losses. In humans, RVFV infection may cause hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, and retinal vasculitis. Many different mosquitoes, including several native to North America, are competent vectors for RVFV transmission. Thus, the introduction of RVFV into North America would likely cause panic in the general population, and the effects on livestock could have a devastating economic impact. Induction of a humoral immune response against the viral envelope proteins is necessary and sufficient to provide protection against RVFV. Currently, there is no RVFV vaccine suitable for mass human vaccination programs. The MP-12 strain, which was obtained by 12 serial passages of the wild-type RVFV strain ZH548 in the presence of 5-fluorouracil, is markedly attenuated in mice but retains its immunogenicity. However, intraperitoneal inoculation of MP-12 into young mice or SCID mice results in efficient virus replication in the animals? central nervous system. The neuroinvasiveness and neurovirulence potential of MP-12 is a matter of concern when considering the mass vaccination of the general public, especially, in immunocompromised individuals. The present application proposes the development of a novel and safer MP-12-derived vaccine candidate having several mutations that selectively abolish specific functions of viral envelope glycoproteins and cause a higher expression level of neutralizing epitopes in infected cells. We will test the hypothesis that this MP-12-based vaccine candidate exhibits a better safety profile than MP-12 in mice but still retains its immunogenicity and protective efficacy. In this proposal, we will examine its genetic stability in cultured cells and assess its safety, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy by using mouse models."
"9359406","Abstract - Project 1 (Targeting Metabolic Dependencies in PDAC)  Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States  with a median survival of less than 6 months and a dismal 5-year survival rate of 7%. The highly malignant  nature of PDAC is largely the result of driving oncogenic Kras mutations (Kras*) in >90% of tumors, as well as  the heterogeneous nature of the disease at both the genomic and cellular levels. To date, no drug directly  targeting Kras* has reached the clinic, and inhibitors of Kras* effector pathways in clinical trials have achieved  only minimal responses followed by relapse of aggressive disease. Furthermore, immune targeting of PDAC  has so far been unsuccessful. Thus, a critical need remains to identify new therapeutic vulnerabilities in PDAC.  In our previous grant cycle, Project 1 and our P01 team established a role for Kras* in tumor maintenance in  vivo wherein it controlled key metabolism enzymes supporting cancer-relevant anabolic processes that, in turn,  are required for Kras*-driven PDAC maintenance. Using our inducible Kras* PDAC model, we also identified a  subset of tumor cells with tumor-initiating cell (TIC) properties that can survive Kras* extinction and may lead to  tumor recurrence following oncogene ablation. One of the hallmarks of these Kras* extinction-resistant cells  (KRCs) is the shift from aerobic glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidative metabolism to sustain cell viability. Our  P01 team further demonstrated that, while PDAC exhibits high basal autophagy, autophagic flux in KRCs was  further enhanced to supply substrate for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and targeting  autophagy or OXPHOS effectively eliminated KRCs to prevent tumor relapse. Therefore, the collaborative work  from our P01 team strongly suggests that effective therapeutics for PDAC should target not only players  essential for Kras*-dependent tumor maintenance, but also pathways required to maintain KRCs. These data  are the basis for an initiative begun during the last grant cycle to develop a novel OXPHOS inhibitor compound  in PDAC, IACS-10759, at the Institute for Applied Cancer Science. In this next cycle, Project 1 will continue our  efforts to better define the metabolism programs that sustain Kras*-dependent tumors as well as KRCs and to  explore the translational potential of targeting metabolic processes, including targeting OXPHOS with IACS-  10759. Project 1 will work closely with the Cores, which have extensive expertise in pathology, preclinical  therapeutics, and computational biology, and will be highly integrated with Project 2 to characterize the role of  autophagy-regulating pathways. Our studies will also integrate with Project 3, using our inducible Kras* mouse  model to explore the effects of Kras*-dependent and ?independent metabolism programs on tumor immunity  and response to immune checkpoint therapy. The knowledge gained from these highly integrated studies aims  to inform future clinical trials opportunities.   "
"9266682","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Upon entry into cells, many diverse viruses exploit their hosts' cytoskeletal transport networks to reach their sub-cellular site of replication, and nw viral progeny use these same networks to return to the cell surface and spread. Viruses frequently move along actin at the cell periphery before transitioning onto host microtubule (MT) networks that mediate long-range intracellular transport. MTs are highly dynamic heteropolymers of ¿/¿ tubulin (half-lives <5 min), which radiate from the perinuclear MT Organization Center (MTOC) towards the cell surface. Subsets of MTs become stabilized (half-life >1h) in response to various environmental and developmental signals, and are thought to act as specialized networks for vesicle transport during events such as cell polarization and motility. MT dynamics and stabilization are controlled by a number of highly specialized regulators, including actin-MT crosslinking factors and MT plus-end binding proteins (+TIPs), whose accumulation at MT ends is facilitated by the MT plus-end tracking protein, EB1. Movement of cargos on these MT networks involves motor proteins; generally, dynein directs minus-end and kinesins direct plus-end transport. However, our understanding of the role of MTs, their regulators and motors in the movement of viral particles during infection is severely limited. This Program Project Grant (PPG) nucleates expertise in cytoskeletal regulation, motors and MT-based motility, cell signaling and infection by diverse viruses to address these fundamental questions in mechanistic detail in a variety of systems. As a group, our interactions to date have established that both RNA and DNA viruses cause distinct MT modifications and require a range of specialized MT regulatory factors for efficient infection, including actin-MT crosslinkers, +TIPs and EB1, as well as identifying specific host motors used for virion traffickin to the nucleus. In this PPG we aim to determine the mechanistic details underlying these highly dynamic interactions between MT subsets, motors and invading virions, including the use of state-of-the-art dual-color imaging to analyze these events in real time. This integrated and interactive approach not only greatly enhances each individual project's potential by leveraging the strengths of other members, but also serves to focus our cumulative expertise on addressing key aspects of the Overall Aims of this PPG, Microtubule Networks and Virus Trafficking. This efficient group approach has the potential to uncover fundamental new insights in MT function and regulation during viral infection that will likely be important in broaer biological contexts and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches."
"9313783","Abstract Incomplete tendon healing leads to significant mobility restriction, pain and health care cost. While a large number of clinical and preclinical approaches for drug- and cell-based therapies, rehabilitation and physical therapy, and other treatment modalities have been attempted, none result in complete recovery of mechanical structure and function in injured tendons. To address this major clinical problem, it is necessary to define the molecular changes and mechanisms governing the tendon healing process in order to develop novel targeted therapies for tendon injury. Interestingly, up-regulation of glycolysis and lactate synthesis occurs in wound, inflammation, immune response and cancer, and is critical for growth/survival of cancerous tumors and polarizing of macrophages. Furthermore, substantial evidence demonstrates that these metabolic changes control growth and differentiation of stem and progenitor cells. These findings support our new concept that modifying metabolic changes would be an effective therapeutic approach for tissue repair and regeneration. Recently we determined that IL-1?, which is up-regulated at the tendon injury site, stimulated the expression of glycolytic enzymes and lactate production in injured-tendon derived progenitors. In addition, once the progenitors were exposed to IL-1?, they irreversibly reduced the ability to express tenogenic markers and increased the requirement of lactate synthesis for their proliferation. Our in vivo preliminary data showed that injured tendons acutely increased an influx of glucose to glyceraldehyde (a metabolite of glycolysis) and lactate. Furthermore, treatment with the pharmacological inhibitor of lactate synthesis, dichroloacetate (DCA), decreased the cross-sectional area of injured tendons, stimulated collagen fiber alignment, increased fiber diameters and dramatically improved the biomechanical properties of injured tendons. Therefore, we have developed the novel hypothesis that glycolysis and lactate synthesis are up-regulated in tendons after injury and correction of this alteration directly stimulates tendon healing. The overall objectives of this study are (1) to determine the metabolic changes during tendon healing and (2) to develop targeted metabolic drugs for tendon repair. To verify our central hypothesis, we propose three Specific Aims: (1) To establish spatiotemporal correlations between glucose metabolism in tendons after acute injury and tendon healing; (2) To examine the effects of glycolysis and lactate synthesis modifiers on tendon healing; and (3) To determine the mechanisms by which inhibition of lactate synthesis stimulates tendon repair while repressing scar formation. The outcome of the project will produce a novel link between glucose metabolism and tendon healing, leading to the development of metabolic modifiers with the ability to promote tendon repair. It will also reveal a novel mechanism of scar formation involving lactate metabolism."
"9382560","PROJECT SUMMARY  Human noroviruses (HNoVs) are medically important non-enveloped positive-sense RNA viruses that cause gastroenteritis. This revised proposal leverages the recent discovery of CD300lf as a receptor for murine NoV (MNoV, Science 2016 353:933) to define mechanisms of NoV pathogenesis, persistence and intestinal immunity. HNoVs do not robustly replicate in small animals and so murine MNoV has emerged as a model system to discover mechanisms of NoV biology and principles of intestinal immunity that would be difficult to identify in human studies or using animals that are not easily manipulated genetically. Studies utilizing MNoV have delineated important aspects of the interplay between virus and host in the intestine. While our proposal was initially restricted to MNoV, seminal work from the Estes lab demonstrates for the first time robust replication of HNoVs in human enteric enteroids and a role for bile acids in HNoV growth (see letter, Science 2016 353:1387) allowing us to collaborate with the Estes laboratory to perform HNoV studies. New data provided in Aim 1 show that specific bile acids function as the soluble 'co-factor' that we reported as essential for the function of CD300lf as an MNoV receptor1. These data suggest a remarkable conservation of dependence on a host factor present in the intestine for both HNoV and MNoV. Based on these advances we propose new studies herein and believe that these studies will enhance the value of our proposed work.  NoV species and cell tropism is determined at the level of cell binding and entry. Thus, host factors including receptor(s) required for infection and pathogenesis are incompletely understood for this viral genus, creating key knowledge gaps for understanding NoV spread, pathogenesis, vaccination, species tropism and persistence. To identify host molecules required for MNoV infection we performed a CRISPR-Cas9-based screen, and discovered that CD300lf is a receptor for MNoV in primary cells and BV2 microglial cells and that it is required for infection in vivo. CD300lf confers the ability of MNoV to bind to cells at 4oC, and is sufficient to render human HeLa cells fully permissive for MNoV replication. The crystal structure of the CD300lf ectodomain revealed an Ig-domain with a ligand binding pocket; amino acids comprising this binding pocket are critical for receptor function for MNoV infection. The soluble ectodomain (sCD300lf) neutralized viral infectivity in vitro and in vivo and we now show that it directly binds to the virion. A soluble cofactor was required for CD300lf receptor function, and new experiments show that specific bile acids function as soluble cofactors. Given these data we propose to test the hypothesis that CD300lf confers tissue and cell tropism responsible for the capacity of MNoV to establish persistent intestinal infection and to elicit immunity through the following Aims: Aim 1: Determine the molecular basis of the role of CD300lf in NoV infection. Aim 2: Determine the role of CD300lf in MNoV tropism, persistence and immunity."
"9256464","?    DESCRIPTION:  Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) are major causes of blindness and visual impairment. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a critical role in the development and progression of neovascular AMD and the current standard of care is monthly intraocular injections of ranibizumab (Lucentis(r)), an antibody fragment that specifically blocks VEGF; two other VEGF binding proteins, bevacizumab (Avastin(r)) and VEGF Trap-eye (Eylea(r)), provide similar benefits. Frequent office visits and injections are necessary to suppress disease progression, however, they also create significant burden on elderly patients, their families, and the health care system, and the risk of severe vision loss from endophthalmitis increases with increased number of injections. Moreover, attempts to reduce visit and injection frequency leave uncovered periods, increasing the chance of subretinal fibrosis and/or hemorrhage and reduced visual outcomes. Therefore, new sustained delivery treatments that provide constant protection are needed. To address this unmet need, we are developing a polymer-drug conjugate technology. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated that doxorubicin (DXR), an inhibitor of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), strongly suppresses and causes regression of ocular neovascularization (NV), but has a short duration of action and narrow therapeutic window. In contrast, our pilot data shows that microparticles of a novel DXR- polymer conjugate (DXR-PSA-PEG3) prolong anti-angiogenic activity at very low DXR doses. Particles that are 0.65 µm in diameter suppressed ocular NV in rho/VEGF transgenic mice, in which the rhodopsin promoter drives expression of VEGF in photoreceptors, for 5 weeks, more than twice as long in the same animal model as a 10 µg/µL intraocular injection of ranibizumab, the same concentration used in humans. No toxicity was observed using sensitive methods, even at 100-times the effective dose. Our pilot data also shows that the polymer particles cause down-regulation of multiple HIF-1 controlled pro-angiogenesis factors, leading to regression of NV (current therapies only reduce leaking from NV). We hypothesize that modifications of the DXR-polymer and microparticle size will allow suppression of ocular NV after a single intraocular injection for several months without causing toxicity, an important step in the development of a new treatment for neovascular AMD and ischemic retinopathies such as diabetic retinopathy. In Specific Aim 1, we will develop and fully characterize new polymers and microsphere formulations that release DXR- monomer conjugates continuously in vitro over much longer periods of time than previously achieved. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and perform pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety studies in rodents on promising formulations from Aim 1. In Specific Aim 3, we will test the efficacy, including the duration of efficacy, of lead formulations from Specific Aim 2 in animal models of ocular NV. If these pre-clinical studies proceed as expected, we are well-positioned for translation into the clinic."
"9385809","PROJECT SUMMARY: Despite a decade of engineering advancements and clinical process improvements, 1 million healthcare- associated infections in the U.S. can be attributed to indwelling medical devices annually. Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) are one of the most promising emerging antimicrobials with potential to combat device related infection. ZnO-NPs are inexpensive, stable, and easy to prepare with broad antimicrobial spectrum and wide therapeutic window. However, the antimicrobial mechanism of action of ZnO-NPs remains elusive. This proposal is specifically motivated to better understand the mechanism of action of ZnO-NPs. Such understanding is necessary to guide the design of device coatings that preserve antibacterial function in vivo. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation or membrane disruption are hypothesized mechanisms of action. However the literature is inconsistent and our preliminary data suggests that these NP effects are not sufficient. We recently demonstrated that ZnO-NPs have shape-dependent, biomimetic, reversible, enzyme inhibition properties. The central research question for this career development grant is: To what extent does ZnO-NP behavior as an enzyme inhibitor contribute to antimicrobial activity? I have multidisciplinary training in medicine, engineering, and molecular biology that is well-suited to address this question. My ultimate career goal is to become a clinician-scientist. I plan to have a clinical interest in sepsis as it relates to indwelling medical devices and an independently funded research program focused on the development of novel biomaterials to resist microbial contamination and infection. This proposal was developed to solidify my expertise, formalize my research niche, and garner the resources for the next phase of career development. My specific career development objectives for the next four years are to: 1. Solidify my expertise in microbiology (including biofilm microbiology), microbial-surface interaction,  nanoparticle technology, and translational research. 2. Master techniques in evaluating mechanisms of action of antimicrobial and anti-biofilm materials. 3. Generate sufficient preliminary data and publication record to obtain independent research funding. 4. Secure my niche as an expert in bacterial-nanomaterial interactions. 5. Obtain secondary appointment in the College of Engineering so that I can work with and mentor  graduate students in their research and career development. I have assembled a mentorship team of experts co-localized at the University of Michigan North Campus Research Complex with experience in clinical medicine, microbiology, material science and engineering, and product development/commercialization. Together we have devised a highly-individualized, project-oriented training plan that includes regular mentorship meetings, formal didactic education, career development workshops, and presentation at local and national conferences. Partnered with this career development plan is an innovative research plan. By synthesizing ZnO-NPs that are identical in surface chemistry but differ only in shape we can control the potential for enzyme inhibition and address the central research question above. Using these novel preparations, we will test the hypothesis: Pyramidal ZnO-NPs inhibit a cohort of bacterial enzymes which are critical to survival. Our research specific aims are to: 1. Quantify aerobic metabolism, membrane integrity, and microbial death in a commonly isolated medical  device pathogen (i.e., Staphylococcus aureus) as a function of exposure time to spherical vs pyramidal ZnO-NPs. 2. Identify genes involved in enzyme inhibition by ZnO-NPs using a mariner transposon mutant library of  S. aureus. 3. Determine the subset of S. aureus proteins that specifically complex with ZnO-NPs in a shape-  dependent manner by 2D-gel electrophoresis followed by liquid chromatography paired with tandem  mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS)."
"9268659","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The LungMap RFA tasks Research Centers to work in a consortium to build an open access molecular resource for the study of human and mouse lung during later stages of development. Our research plan will focus to the generation and analysis of detailed NexGen gene expression data for both human and mouse lung from the late canalicular-saccular through the alveolar periods of development. The lung is comprised of diverse parenchymal- and hematopoietic derived cells, whose abundance, differentiation, and functions vary developmentally, regionally, and among species. Temporal and spatial interactions among diverse cell types orchestrate formation and function of the lung. While many of the genes and networks regulating lung formation are shared among vertebrate species, the physiology, structure and regional specific cell types, and gene expression patterns vary between murine and human lung. To effectively translate data from mouse models to humans, it is critical to understand their molecular similarities and differences at the cellular level. We will generate a detailed cell specific RNA database for human and mouse lung parenchyma. Single cell RNA-seq will be interpreted with data derived from laser capture microdissection (LCM), FACS, RNA analyses, and molecular imaging to create an expression map of human and mouse lung. Computational and systems biology approaches will integrate these data to create readily accessible databases that will synergize research related to pulmonary development, disease, and function. This application will focus to the analysis of cells from normal lung parenchyma (e.g., conducing airway and alveolar epithelial cells; vascular endothelial cells, including venous, arterial, lymphatic, and capillary cells; stromal and adventitial cells, including fibroblasts, pericytes, myofibroblasts, and cartilage; and neuroepithelial and neuronal cells). Aim 1: Cell Specific NexGen RNA Analyses to Create an Atlas of Gene Expression In the Murine Lung. Single cell isolation, FACS purification, and LCM of lung parenchymal cells, and RNA-Seq will create a temporal-spatial map of gene expression in the mouse from E15.5 to postnatal day 28. Aim 2: Cell Specific NexGen RNA Analysis to Create an Atlas of Gene Expression In Human Fetal Lung. Single cell isolation, LCM, and FACS analysis followed by RNA-Seq will create a map of the temporal-spatial patterns of the gene expression during human lung formation from 22 weeks of gestation through the postnatal-alveolar period. Aim 3: Bioinformatics Analysis of NexGen RNAs to Define Gene Expression During Murine and Human Lung Formation. Bioinformatics and computational biology of RNA sequence data from the murine and human lung studies will be analyzed, curated using defined anatomic ontologies, and integrated to provide a sensitive and quantitative measure of gene expression patterns of the precise RNA splice forms, microRNAs and other noncoding RNAs expressed during lung formation.

"9387098","Respiratory viruses are the number one cause of mortality in infants, however, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate airway antiviral immune responses in this vulnerable age group. MicroRNAs (miRNA), are small non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression and immune responses. Notably, some miRNAs are selectively exported in extracellular vesicles (exosomes) by immune cells to induce cell-to-cell genetic reprogramming. Our preliminary studies in infants showed that miR-155, a potent enhancer of interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral immunity, is the most abundant miRNA found in exosomes derived from nasal washes (n=20) during rhinovirus (RV) infection, the most common cause of viral respiratory illnesses in early life. This novel finding suggests that miR-155 plays a key role in the host defense against RV in humans and thus may be a new target for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. This proposal is focused on elucidating the biological effects of miR-155 in the nasal airway epithelium (AE), the primary target of RV infection in humans. Our central hypothesis is that exosomal miR-155 increases IFN responses in the nasal AE cells of infants and enhances their airway antiviral immunity during RV infection. Two Specific Aims are proposed: Specific Aim 1. Define the exosomal miR-155 response during in vivo RV infection in infants and determine its association with airway immune responses and clinical disease. Our hypothesis is that high nasal exosomal miR-155 levels provide stronger airway antiviral (Th1) responses, faster clearance of RV and decreased respiratory disease severity. Specific Aim 2. Establish the effects of exogenous miR-155 therapy in infant-derived nasal airway epithelial cells during in vitro RV infection. Our hypothesis is that exogenous miR- 155 treatment (synthetic miR-155 mimic loaded in liposomes) increases antiviral IFN production and inhibits RV replication in primary nasal AE cells from infants. This transdisciplinary proposal takes advantage of our access to a large population of infants and state-of-the-art resources for Genomics and Airway Biology. Given the unique nature of our samples (nasal epithelium from infants), the proposed molecular and genomic studies during RV infection in vivo (Aim1) and in vitro (Aim2) will greatly advance the field providing ground-breaking new insights into the potential mechanisms regulating early life airway immune responses against respiratory viruses in humans, a markedly understudied area."
"9308856","Project 4 will investigate integration of patient-specific data (acquired from anatomic and physiological imaging and  clinical Studies before and during therapy) together with other data and models of tumor and normal tissue  response into individualized adaptive plan optimization. Though delivering the dose distribution that was  prescribed at the beginning of treatment has been the goal of modifications of standard radiation planning, it is  likely that this goal is not the best overall objective for each patient, when one takes into account the additional  clinical and other information which can become available during the course of therapy. That is, each patient, and  their tumor, changes over the course of treatment. However, approaches to deal with these changes have been  makeshift and focused, in isolation, on only one issue at a time. The sum of those single-step corrections is vety  unlikely to achieve the overall best solution for the patient. Therefore, the overall goal of this project is to develop  and study methods that will integrate important clinical, imaging, and biological data and changes into an overall  planning strategy to optimize each patient's treatment course in order to truly individualize therapy. Thus, this  project addresses needed research on utilizing imaging and clinical response factors for decision support, adaptive  treatment strategies and plan optimization. In particular, Specific Aim 1 will be tasked with organizing the expanse  of population and patient specific data that exists and applying that information to provide knowledge-based  decision support to help facilitate the best adaptive course of patient treatment. Specific Aim 2 will design and  investigate the adaptive treatment strategies that will lead to the greatest therapeutic gain for individual patients.  The goal of Specific Aim 3 is to provide the radiation therapy treatment plan or set of plans that epitomizes the  recommended course of therapy for each patient. Adaptive clinical trial strategies for the treatment sites studied in  Projects 1 and 2 will be formulated; and we will run simulations to test these strategies for a variety of scenarios.  Uncertainty assessments determined in Project 3 will also be incorporated. As part of the adaptive strategies will  depend on planning quality, optimization studies will continue towards improving the quality and ease of achieving  the best plans that take advantage of improved knowledge with regard to individual patient responses."
"9322075","Our understanding of the pathogenesis of diabetes, obesity and other metabolic disorders has benefited greatly from the use of dietary interventions and gene targeting methodology in mice to elucidate molecular mechanisms. However, such efforts are often hampered by a lack of facilities or expertise for metabolic phenotyping. The Mouse Phenotyping, Physiology and Metabolism Core provides investigators of the Penn Diabetes and Endocrinology Research Center (DRC) with access to state-of-the-art, timely and cost-effective resources for performing metabolic studies in mice. The core offers consultation and assistance with experimental design, and an expanding list of services including Comprehensive Laboratory Animal Monitoring System (CLAMS) that can simultaneously record energy expenditure, locomotor activity, eating and drinking, glucose and insulin clamp studies (including radioactive tracers for determining hepatic glucose output and uptake into other tissues), measurement of body composition using dual emission x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, thermal imaging, exercise capacity, and a variety of standard metabolic assays. In addition to the many existing services that have been critical to the productivity of DRC investigators, we are excited to be providing new services aimed at phenotyping in variably controlled conditions of ambient temperature and light, as well as facilitating metabolic flux studies through the development of ?cold clamp? techniques for delivery of isotope-labeled metabolites while controlling glucose and insulin levels. Studies in the core are performed by two research specialists and a technical director under the leadership of Dr. Joseph Baur and coordinated with other core laboratories including the Biomarkers and Metabolomics cores. These efforts allow DRC investigators to rapidly translate ideas from the bench to mice as the first critical steps toward new therapeutic approaches for the multitude of patients suffering form diabetes and related disorders."
"9213303","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca release represents a large charge translocation that could very quickly (<1 ms) move the SR membrane potential (Vm) to the Ca equilibrium potential (ECa), where net Ca release will cease (1). However, this does not happen because there is a simultaneous countercurrent during release. In the previous funded period, we established that the multi-ion, poorly selective, pore of the ryanodine receptor (RyR) mediates large counter Mg and K fluxes, while it releases Ca. The RyR therefore carries the bulk of required countercurrent itself. This leaves the physiological roles of the SR K and Cl channels unclear. The SR K and Cl channels may carry a small important element of countercurrent during release, but they may also provide vital pathways for counter ions to re-equilibrate across the SR after release. Indeed, the mechanisms of SR ion and charge balance are so poorly understood that we do not know their significance to SR Ca handling, their possible pathological contributions or whether they can be exploited for therapeutic benefit.  In 2010, the trimeric intracellular cation (TRIC) protein was identified as the SR K channel (2). Ablation of both TRIC isoforms (A & B) is embryonically lethal. Ablation of just TRIC-A (predominant form in skeletal muscle) generates clear in SR Ca handling abnormalities (abnormal local Ca release events and SR Ca overload; (3-5)). TRIC-A KO muscle not only proves there is a mechanistic link between SR Ca handling and SR ion balance, but provides a unique opportunity to define it. Here, we will use TRIC-A KO muscle to define how the complex spatiotemporal Ca, Mg, K and Cl fluxes through RyR, SR K and SR Cl channels control SR ion (voltage) balance and modulate SR Ca handling in skeletal muscle.  The hypothesis tested here is: The SR K (TRIC) and SR Cl channels do not carry essential countercurrent during individual skeletal muscle SR Ca release events but instead provides crucial SR ion re-equilibration pathways, assuring SR ion balance and that SR Vm returns to resting values between release events. Defective re-equilibration, not missing countercurrent, explains the SR Ca handling defects observed in TRIC-KO skeletal muscle. This is tested by the following specific aims. Aim 1: Determine if SR K or Cl channels carry essential countercurrent during SR Ca release. Aim 2: Determine if SR K or Cl channels provide vital resting SR ion re-equilibration pathways. Aim 3: Establish the mechanism underlying abnormal SR Ca handling in TRIC-A KO muscle. Expected Outcome: Delineate new potential points of SR pathological failure (and/or sites at which SR function can be therapeutically manipulated) by transforming existing Ca-centric view of SR function to encompass the multi-ion (Ca, Mg, K, Cl) reality, which governs SR Ca release/uptake."
"9308854","The long-term goal of this project is to increase non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumor control without  increasing treatment toxicity by adapting therapy to the individual patient's response. This goal will be  carried out through two specific aims. Aim 1 is to conduct a pilot study to decrease toxicity by adapting  therapy to the uninvolved lung and esophagus while continuing to adapt therapy to the tumor for  patients with Stage II/III NSCLC cancer. We have recently completed a phase II study in which we  targeted FDG avid regions midtreatment with a high dose of radiation and achieved a >20% improvement in  local control over standard dose (60 Gy), although toxicity was greater. With maturing of response based  predictive models for treatment toxicity, we propose a pilot study in which we will continue to adapt therapy  midtreatment to intensify dose to the residual FDG avid tumor, and we will use: 1) V/Q SPECT-CT scanning  to avoid functional lung; 2) FDG-PET-CT to adapt the risk of esophageal injury; and 3) reduce dose in  patients who are unusually sensitive to radiation (by measuring TGFbetal and IL-8). We hypothesize that by  adapting radiation therapy to the uninvolved lung and esophagus, we can maintain the dose to the FDG-avid  tumor while causing no greater overall toxicity than expected from standard therapy (60 Gy uniformly  delivered to the tumor). Aim 2 is to conduct a phase II randomized trial to compare standard therapy  to therapy that adapts treatment to the individual patient's tumor and uninvolved tissue response.  This aim will use the methodology developed from aim 1 for the experimental arm that fully adapts  treatment based on intensifying treatment to the FDG avid tumor while limiting the toxicity of uninvolved lung  and esophagus to be no greater than that anticipated to be caused by standard therapy. This will be  accomplished by 1) avoiding functioning lung at the start of treatment; 2) by replanning midtreatment based  on adapting to the response of the tumor and of the uninvolved lung and esophagus and 3) reducing dose to  the most sensitive patients. This arm will be compared in a randomized phase II trial to a standard arm (60  Gy) (both arms with the same chemotherapy). We hypothesize that treating patients with adaptive radiation  therapy based on the tumor and normal organ responses assessed during treatment will produce superior  tumor control at no greater toxicity than the standard arm of 60 Gy uniformly delivered to the tumor. The  impact o f t h i s work is that it will develop a new paradigm for radiation oncology in which treatment is  optimized by adapting therapy to the individual patient response, rather than based on the average  patient."

"9275040","Project 2 will determine how targeting molecules that regulate permeability and polarity at  central nervous system (CNS) endothelial barriers impacts neuroinflammation, as assessed via  novel neuroimaging modalities with murine models of multiple sclerosis (MS). We have shown  that endothelium in MS lesions exhibits altered polarity, displaying the abluminal chemokine  CXCL12 aberrantly along luminal surfaces. Abluminal CXCL12 normally serves to limit  leukocyte entry whereas luminal expression of CXCL12 is associated with increased activation  of its signaling receptor CXCR4 on infiltrating leukocytes. We showed that the scavenging  CXCL12 receptor, CXCR7 (also expressed by CNS endothelium), is a critical regulator of  leukocyte entry via internalization of CXCL12 from abluminal surfaces. In preliminary studies,  we have also found that sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) signaling via S1P2 disturbs abluminal  expression of CXCL12, which then disrupts immune privilege. Thus, mice with targeted deletion  of S1P2 or administered a specific antagonist, JTE-013, show reduced migration of leukocytes  into the CNS parenchyma during EAE. We hypothesize that alterations in membrane polarity of  CXCL12 at CNS endothelial barriers promote leukocyte capture and migration into the CNS,  contributing to the establishment of disease cycles in relapsing-remitting forms of CNS  autoimmunity. We have identified several molecules that regulate this process, leading to  reversal of apicobasal expression of the localizing cue, CXCL12. In this proposal, we will  examine the roles of CXCR7 and S1P2 in lymphocyte trafficking and inflammation in CNS  autoimmune disease using novel imaging modalities including two-photon intravital  microscopy and longitudinally using Diffusion Basis Spectrum Imaging (DBSI), which  distinguishes and quantitates cellularity and edema in live mice (see Project 1) and  examination of autopsied human MS patient and control CNS tissues.  We expect DBSI to be more sensitive than Gd enhancement to inflammation, including in the  setting of less profound blood-brain barrier alterations. To determine the relationships between  endothelial and immune cell (Th1 versus Th17) interactions and loss of BBB integrity, we will  directly compare results utilizing intravital imaging to DBSI and Gd enhancement in the same  animals. To address mechanisms by which endothelial cell polarity and localizing cues are  induced by interactions with inflammatory cells, we will utilize in vitro and in situ approaches with  human tissues. Thus, Aim 1 will determine whether CXCR7-mediated internalization of CXCL12  requires infiltration with Th1 versus Th17 cells during EAE. Aim 2 will determine whether S1P2-  mediated reversal of endothelial cell polarity leads to increased T cell capture and entry during  EAE, and Aim 3 will examine the relationship between CXCR7 and S1PR2 activation and T cell  migration at the BBB in MS.

"9230221","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the availability of psychosocial evidence-based practices (EBPs), quality and outcomes for persons with mental disorders remain suboptimal because of organizational barriers to implementation. Replicating Effective Programs (REP), an implementation intervention applied to promote the use of psychosocial treatments in community-based practices, still resulted in less than half of sites actually sustaining the use of these treatments. Based on input from community partners from our previous R01 (MH79994), the study team subsequently enhanced REP to include Facilitation, a novel implementation intervention which addresses site- level organizational barriers to EBP adoption beyond REP's emphasis on fidelity. Two Facilitation roles were developed: External and Internal Facilitators. External Facilitators (EFs) reside outside the clinic, are supported by the study, and provide technical expertise to providers in adapting and using EBPs in routine practice. Internal Facilitators (IFs) are employed by the sites, have a direct reporting relationshp to site leadership, and have protected time to conduct activities to help site program champions implement EBPs. IFs also address site-specific organizational barriers that may not be observable at baseline or by EFs. The overarching goal of this study is to build the most cost-effective adaptive implementation intervention involving REP and the augmentation of the EF and IF roles to improve patient outcomes and the uptake of an EBP for mood disorders (Life Goals-LG) in community settings. The primary aim of this clustered randomized trial is to determine, among sites not initially responding to REP (i.e., limited LG uptake), the effect of adaptive implementation interventions in sites receiving External and Internal Facilitator (REP+EF/IF) versus External Facilitator alone (REP+EF) on improved patient-level outcomes, including mental health quality of life and decreased symptoms, as well as increased LG use among patients with mood disorders after 12 months. Secondary aims are to determine, among sites that continue to exhibit non-response after 12 months, the effect of continuing Facilitation on patient-level outcomes at 24 months, describe the implementation of EF and IF, and to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of REP+EF/IF compared to REP+EF over the 24-month period. A representative cohort of 100 community-based outpatient clinics (total 1,600 patients) from different U.S. regions (Michigan, Colorado, and Arkansas) will be included in this study. We will use a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design to build the best adaptive implementation intervention. This groundbreaking study design will address three crucial implementation issues: First, IFs are costly for sites since they require additional administrative effort. Second, the extent to which an off-site EF alone versus the addition of an on- site IF can improve patient outcomes in community settings is unclear. Finally, among sites that continue to exhibit non-response after 12 months of Facilitation, the value of continuing the implementation strategy (i.e., delayed effect) has not been assessed, especially in smaller practices from more rural settings."
"9352407","Skin cancer is primarily caused by environmental ultraviolet (UV) exposure from sunlight. We have shown that loss of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR?) in the epidermis of mice (Pparg-/-epi mice) promotes UV-induced skin cancer formation. We have also shown that the PPAR? agonist rosiglitazone (Rosig) protects mice against skin cancer formation. The historical method for classifying PPAR? ligands is by their ability to activate genes associated with adipogenesis through a process called transactivation. However, PPAR? ligands that both activate and suppress transactivation have been shown to exhibit anti-tumor activity. This has created confusion regarding the anti-tumor effects of PPAR?. However, some PPAR? ligands also exhibit the ability to suppress the expression of other genes through a distinctly different mechanism called ?transrepression?. We hypothesize that PPAR? ligand-dependent transrepression, rather than transactivation, is key to the anti-tumor activity of PPAR?. UV suppresses T-cell mediated contact hypersensitivity (CHS) responses as well as anti-tumor immune responses (termed UV-induced immunosuppression (UV-IS)). UV-IS likely promotes skin cancer formation by promoting tolerance to tumor-specific antigens. We show that loss of epidermal PPAR? produces an immunosuppressive state resulting in a marked defect in CHS responses as well as enhanced skin tumor growth. We also show that Rosig treatment blocks UV-IS and suppresses skin tumor growth in immune competent, but not immunodeficient mouse hosts. We hypothesize that PPAR? activation suppresses UV-induced skin cancer formation at least in part by its ability to transrepress signaling pathways involved in UV-IS. In particular, we show that PPAR? transrepresses a protein called tumor necrosis factor ? (TNF-?) that is present as both a full-length transmembrane form and a soluble proteolytically cleaved form. We propose that the transmembrane form (tmTNF-?) is primarily involved in immune suppression. Thus, PPAR? ligands may prove useful as long-term chemopreventive agents that would promote immune-mediated clearance of nascent skin tumors in individuals at high risk for skin cancer. Finally, recent studies have shown that radiation therapy, like UV, also promotes systemic immunosuppression through its ability to induce oxidative stress. We propose that transrepressive PPAR? ligands will reverse this immune suppression and promote the so-called abscopal effect. This abscopal effect results in anti-tumor responses in tumors that are outside the field of radiation treatment. Although spontaneous abscopal effects occur rarely, evidence exists that efforts to promote immune responses can make this response commonplace. We propose that transrepressive PPAR? ligands will act in concert with radiotherapy to promote the abscopal effect. To examine our hypothesis, the studies will be divided into the following three specific aims (SA):  SA#1: Determine whether epidermal PPAR? regulates CHS responses through transmembrane TNF-?  (tmTNF-?) rather than soluble TNF-? (solTNF-?).  SA#2: Determine the capacity of diverse PPAR? ligands to induce PPAR?-specific transrepression of  UVB-induced NF-?B activation and TNF-? production in vitro and in vivo. We will correlate this  transrepressive activity with the ability to reverse UV-induced suppression of CHS responses.  SA#3: Determine whether transrepressive PPAR? ligands promote anti-tumor immune responses either  alone or following external beam radiation therapy. These studies will demonstrate the importance of transrepressive PPAR? ligand-dependent signaling in regulating anti-tumor immune responses. It will also provide mechanistic insight into how PPAR? activation acts to suppress tumorigenesis and promote anti-tumor immune responses and provide a rationale for the use of transrepressive PPAR? ligands as chemopreventive agents or as an adjunct to current radiotherapy."

Core B (Preclinical Therapeutics)  The Preclinical Therapeutics Core will leverage the expertise and infrastructure of the Center for Molecular  Therapeutics at the Massachusetts General Hospital and of the Center for Co-Clinical Trials at the MD  Anderson Cancer Center. High throughput drug screening of established and project derived cells  representing the array of PDAC subtypes will be performed. A curated collection of clinically relevant  compounds as well as novel compounds specifically relevant to the projects will be used in 2D and 3D cell  viability assays using defined metabolic conditions. Signaling pathway and immune-modulator measurements  will also be performed to inform mechanism of action and evaluate the impact of treatments on the interaction  between PDAC cells and the immune system. Data that emerge from in vitro screens will be prioritized for in  vivo efficacy studies at the Center for Co-Clinical Trials. Here, a dedicated pharmacology staff will evaluate  single agents or drug combinations in the most relevant pre-clinical PDAC models, including human PDx and  autochthonous GEM models. Through comprehensive pharmacologic analyses, the Core B aims to evaluate  novel therapeutic approaches and define biomarkers that may predict responsiveness in clinical trials."

Towards this latter goal, Core B will generate and  maintain encephalitogenic and control T cell lines. Core B will also assist in all outcome  measurements, histological analyses and immunohistochemical approaches. To support PPG  investigators? exploration of alternative approaches and establish future goals for all Projects,  Core B will also establish a murine tissue bank for screening purposes. Because the overall  goal of all animals work is to translate findings to human tissues and, ultimately, patients, Core  B will establish and maintain a human CNS tissue bank with histopathologic analyses from  control and MS patients plus banked peripheral blood mononuclear cells, sera and  cerebrospinal fluid. These samples will be utilized by all Projects to validate findings in murine  models and to further investigate findings in murine systems using human tissues. We recently  hired a dedicated technician to process, catalogue and coordinate the evaluation of CNS  specimens for inflammation, demyelination, axonal injury and remyelination.

The AIPT Core (previously known as the Applied Therapeutics & Whole Animal Imaging Core) was approved for CCSG funding as a new Shared Resource in 2009 with a limited budget because of the nascent nature of this effort. During the current period, usage of the AIPT Core increased dramatically and now 47% of CCSG Members (representing all four programs) rely on the AIPT Core?s services. To support this demand, the Core?s capabilities have been greatly expanded and enhanced using non-renewable MIT funds. This includes: moving into new space that is custom-designed to enable longitudinal imaging and preclinical testing in mouse models; the acquisition of extensive new imaging instrumentation, including small animal MRI and MRS; and a significant expansion of the staff. Thus, this Shared Resource is essential to the success of the Koch Institute mission. In the upcoming period, the AIPT Core will continue to offer a wide range of animal imaging and pre-clinical services to support the research programs of Center Members. To stabilize the staff salaries in this now fully established Core, and allow addition of an MRI specialist, a significant increase in the AIPT Core CCSG budget is requested."
"9359407","Abstract - Project 2 (Role of Lysosomal Scavenging in PDAC Metabolism)  Kras mutation (KRAS*) is the signature genetic alteration in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) that  our P01 team and others have demonstrated to be critical to disease genesis and maintenance. While  inhibitors of KRAS* have proven difficult to develop, alterations in cellular metabolism have emerged as  promising targets for therapeutic intervention. Indeed, we have discovered that a major function of KRAS* in  tumor maintenance is to orchestrate the profound metabolic rewiring of PDAC cells, including alterations in  glucose and glutamine utilization. Furthermore, we have broadly elucidated additional metabolic dependencies  of KRAS* PDAC. PDAC exhibit a strikingly high level of nutrient scavenging via autophagy and  macropinocytosis. These processes converge at the lysosome where cargo (extracellular, from  macropinocytosis; intracellular, from autophagy) is degraded and the resulting metabolites are recycled for  use in anabolic and bioenergetic pathways. Indeed we and others have shown that these scavenging  processes are critical for PDAC growth and metabolic homeostasis. We have also identified a regulatory  network responsible for induction and integration of these recycling pathways. Based on these findings, the  goals of Project 2 are to: 1) identify the metabolic outputs of these lysosomal pathways and how they integrate  with cellular metabolism; 2) decipher the circuits that reprogram PDAC to rely on these pathways; 3) define  signatures predicting reliance on these pathways; and 4) identify combinatorial approaches that effectively  target this dependency and prevent metabolic escape. Our highly integrated joint studies will explore these  processes in cells that escape Kras* inactivation (with Project 1) and in innovative models for tumor-stroma  interactions (with Project 3), and depend on the Cores for tissue, drug screening, therapeutics and  computational resources. Given ongoing clinical trials with the lysosomal inhibitor, hydroxychloroquine, these  studies can have a transformative impact on PDAC treatment. At the same time, the full translational potential  of our work requires integrated understanding of synergies/interferences of targeting salvage pathways,  metabolic processes, Kras* effectors, Kras* bypass mechanisms and immune cells. The need for this integrated  view is a central rationale of the P01 program.    "
"9322076","ABSTRACT The DRC Regional Metabolomics Core at Princeton provides Penn DRC investigators with access to state-of- the-art metabolomics and flux analysis. These capabilities allow DRC investigators to measure, both broadly and quantitatively, metabolic activity in cell culture, animal model, and clinical specimens relevant to diabetes and obesity. Now entering its 5th year, the Core has seen steadily increasing usage and is on track to analyze over 5000 samples in 2016. Thus, investigator demand for its services are high. This reflects the Core's position as a leader in metabolomics and lipidomics, with a particular focus on integration of these technologies with isotope tracing to reveal dynamic metabolic activity. In Aim 1, the Core will provide metabolomics services covering approximately 300 water-soluble metabolites and approximately 500 lipids. This will be achieved via mass spectroscopy-based analytical methods validated for their specificity and quantitative reproducibility. Aim 2 focuses on isotope tracer studies. To this end, the Core will guide tracer study design, carry out labeling pattern measurement, and facilitate data interpretation for both cell culture and in vivo research. Methods are now in place to trace major circulating nutrients in mice, and are being actively utilized to investigate mouse models of obesity and diabetes. Aim 3 involves expansion of the Core's capabilities. Beyond continuous improvement in breadth, depth, and quantitative reproducibility of metabolome coverage, this will include (i) new methods for in vivo tracing and (ii) establishment of a new joint Penn-Princeton Clinical Metabolomics Team to further increase clinical application of the Core's capabilities. The net effect will be to augment the scientific and clinical impact of the DRC through use of transformative metabolomics and flux analysis approaches to better understand?and thereby eventually more effectively diagnose and treat? diabetes, obesity, and related metabolic disorders."
"9333227","Program Abstract - Overall The goal for this renewal application is to a) elucidate oncogenic Kras (Kras*)-regulated metabolic pathways mediating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumor maintenance, b) define collateral metabolic dependencies, and c) establish how interventions targeting these processes influence tumor immunity, in order to guide the design of clinical trials with existing drugs and to identify new therapeutic points of attack. Our P01 program comprises 3 highly interdependent and collaborative projects and 4 essential cores with the goals of conquering PDAC through targeting metabolic vulnerabilities in conjunction with immunotherapy. Project 1 (DePinho with Draetta) has demonstrated that Kras* extinction in PDAC leads to pronounced tumor regression that involves critical functions of Kras* in metabolic reprogramming. We have also identified Kras*-extinction resistant cells (KRCs), which show dramatic adaptive metabolic changes (in OXPHOS and autophagy) allowing survival upon Kras* inactivation. These studies thereby provide benchmarks for successfully targeting Kras* in vivo and predicting resistance mechanisms that may be encountered in the clinic. Thus, the goal of Project 1 is to kill the bulk Kras*-dependent tumor cells through identification of metabolic targets essential for Kras*-mediated PDAC maintenance and to define methods to eliminate KRC through inhibiting autophagy and OXPHOS survival mechanisms. Project 2 (Bardeesy with Kimmelman and Cantley) has discovered that PDAC is dependent on lysosome-dependent nutrient scavenging pathways for metabolic homeostasis and tumor growth, and has identified a transcriptional program that activates these processes. The goal of Project 2 is to decipher how lysosomal scavenging supports PDAC growth and how cancer cells can escape their dependence on these processes, thereby informing improved therapeutic approaches. Project 2 will identify the metabolic outputs of lysosomal mediated recycling pathways, establish which of these outputs play roles in PDAC growth, and explore metabolic escape pathways in order to identify novel therapeutic combinations synergizing with lysosomal inhibition. Project 3 (Kalluri with Allison) has defined profound alterations in the tumor microenvironment, including a prominent CD8 T cell infiltration following Kras* extinction in PDAC. Project 3 will define the immune profiles throughout the genesis, regression and recurrence of PDAC and will determine the causal role of CD8 and CD4 cells in PDAC regression, as well as explore new opportunities to test the efficacy of checkpoint blockade therapy and assess the associated adaptive mechanisms underlying immune suppression. Furthermore, Project 3 will determine the direct impact of metabolically targeted therapy on tumor immunity and define effective methods to combine such therapies with immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Highly innovative cores for Pathology (Maitra), Preclinical Therapeutics (Benes), Computation (Futreal), and an Administrative Core will enable these Projects."

"9258883","Project Summary The research proposed here seeks to address how, on a molecular level, environmental sensing proteins transmit the sensed signal to the biologically active domain of the protein. The system to be studied is a monomeric, soluble, histidine kinase from the marine bacterium Erythrobacter litoralis HTCC2594 (EL346): specifically, how the protein senses blue light using a sensor LOV (light-oxygen-voltage) domain (a type of PAS [Per-ARNT-Sim] domain) and passes on the signal to a kinase domain. The aim of this research is to identify a more generally applicable mechanism for activation than that previously proposed for dimeric histidine kinases. Specific research goals are (1) to figure out what determines whether a sensor kinase is monomeric or dimeric, (2) to determine the molecular mechanism of activation of the kinase domain, and (3) to outline what types of small molecules different PAS domains bind. First, proteins homologous to EL346 will be found, their oligomeric state determined, and high-resolution structures of monomeric and dimeric proteins compared. Second, high-resolution structures will be determined for active and inactive histidine kinases and compared. Thirds, a fragment library of small molecules will be screened against a representative set of PAS domains to tease out what types of PAS domains bind what types of ligands. The research training plan includes working under Dr. Kevin Gardner's supervision to gain expertise in integrating different structural biology techniques with biochemical data to fully describe a biological system on a molecular scale. Sensor histidine kinases are part of two-component systems used by bacteria, plants, and fungi to sense and respond to different cues in the environment. Because humans lack these two-component systems, these bacterial systems are attractive targets for targeted antibacterial drugs. However, high-resolution structural information and a mechanistic understanding of signal transmission are required to design effective therapeutics. The research proposed here will provide this understanding. Other sensor kinases use the related PAS domain as a sensor for small molecules; these systems are attractive as starting points for biosensors (cellular, diagnostic, or environmental). The expected findings on PAS domain compound binding can be used to design such biosensors. Thus, the outcomes of the proposed experiments will not only increase researchers' understanding of signal transduction systems in general, but also provide a foundation for the development of new biosensors and therapeutics and impact how diseases are treated."
"9386237","PROJECT SUMMARY Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of severe acute lower respiratory tract infection in infants and children worldwide. Severe RSV bronchiolitis as a child is also a critical risk factor in the development of wheezing and allergic asthma later in life. Bovine RSV (BRSV) is closely related to human RSV and a significant cause of morbidity in young cattle. BRSV infection in calves displays many striking similarities to HRSV infection in humans, and cattle are an outbred population that is naturally susceptible to BRSV infection. Further, calves with severe BRSV infection are also prone to the development of virus-associated allergic airway disease, thus mimicking the association between RSV bronchiolitis and development of allergic asthma that is observed in humans. Therefore, BRSV infection in calves represents an excellent model for studying RSV infection, antiviral immunity and the development of virus-associated allergic airway disease in children. Interleukin-17A (IL-17) is an inflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in neutrophil recruitment and activation. It is primarily produced by activated CD4 T cells, termed Th17 cells, and activated gamma delta T cells. IL-17 is increased in children and rodents with severe RSV infection; and in calves with severe BRSV infection. Reports from mice about the role of IL-17 during RSV infection are contradictory, and studies from humans are limited and primarily correlative; therefore, it is currently unclear if IL-17 and Th17 immunity is beneficial or detrimental to the host during RSV infection or during the development of RSV-associated allergic airway disease. The neonatal calf represents a tractable model of the infant immune system, and is a natural host for BRSV that closely mimics critical aspects of disease pathogenesis and immunity in humans with RSV. Therefore, the calf is an ideal model for determining the effect of IL-17 on RSV disease. The experiments in Aim 1 are designed to determine how pharmacologic inhibition of IL-17 production effects disease outcome and immunity during uncomplicated BRSV infection in the neonatal calf. The experiments in Aim 2 are designed to determine how inhibition of IL-17 production effects the development of RSV-associated allergic airway disease in the neonatal calf. Much of our knowledge of RSV infection and immunity stems from studies in rodents and adult animals; however, the experiments proposed here will study a natural host-pathogen interaction and will examine the response in the neonate, the same population commonly targeted by severe disease. It is anticipated that these studies will have a positive impact by identifying a role for IL-17 in protecting or harming the host during severe RSV infection, and by identifying IL-17 and Th17 responses as possible targets for the development of therapeutic intervention strategies to be used in patients with severe RSV bronchiolitis."
